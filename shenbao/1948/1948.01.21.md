### Election of the First Legislative Yuan Members Begins Today Across the Country; President and Madame to Personally Vote

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The election of Legislative Yuan members will commence simultaneously on the 21st in 47 provinces and cities across the country, 18 leagues and banners in Mongolia, 3 electoral districts in Tibet, ethnic minority areas in special provinces, and 15 electoral districts for overseas Chinese. All male and female citizens aged 20 and above with the right to vote will participate in the voting process according to regulations. It is reported that the number of registered voters is approximately 250 million, and there are over 2,000 candidates nationwide competing for seats in the Legislative Yuan. A total of 773 Legislative Yuan members are to be elected this session.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The election of the first Legislative Yuan members of our country is scheduled to begin nationwide on the 21st and will last for three days. A total of 773 Legislative Yuan members will be elected, including 691 men and 82 women. The election in the capital city is divided into 13 districts with 95 polling stations. President Chiang and his wife will personally vote as citizens. The campaign activities of the Legislative Yuan candidates in the capital have reached a fever pitch. Furthermore, regarding Ms. Li Jianhong, a female Legislative Yuan candidate in the capital, after the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee provisionally approved her as a substitute candidate, it is reported that President Chiang has reviewed and decided to maintain the original status, not increasing the number of female candidates beyond Liu Heng. The Central Standing Committee has already notified the election committee to cancel the change.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 20th] Due to bandit disturbances and transportation obstructions in certain counties in Henan, the number of voters has not been fully ascertained. Moreover, the list of Legislative Yuan nominees from political parties arrived late from the Central Government to the province, and there was insufficient time to print ballots, making it difficult to postpone the election. The provincial election committee held an emergency meeting yesterday and, after careful discussion, decided that the Legislative Yuan election in this province will be rescheduled after all preparations are completed.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 20th] The list of candidates for the national professional organizations' Legislative Yuan election in the Northeast region has been fully received in Changchun. The city election committee has formally announced it today. All other election matters have also been fully prepared. The election date will be announced after receiving a telegram from the provincial election committee confirming it.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] On the eve of the Legislative Yuan election, Zhang Lisheng, Chairman of the General Election Committee, stated in response to reporters' inquiries that the procedures for the Legislative Yuan election are no different from those of the National Assembly election. However, voting in the Legislative Yuan election uses a circle-marking method. The list of candidates for each district has been printed on the ballot. Voters only need to circle one person they deem ideal based on their free choice to complete the election task. However, it is important to note the "freedom to choose." According to electoral custom, we should adhere to the principle of secret ballot in any voting we conduct. Voters do not need to reveal the names of their chosen candidates to others, and outsiders should not be able to find out the names of those they voted for. In a democratic political system, respecting the freedom of others should be the highest morality, and inquiring about the candidate someone voted for is suspected of hindering their freedom of choice. Zhang further stated that the General Election Committee has instructed all election committees to strictly adhere to the election procedures and the points for improvement indicated by the General Committee, to proceed on schedule, and to avoid any deviations from the time limits and regulations. Zhang expressed great satisfaction with the enthusiastic attitude of voters nationwide during the National Assembly election. He continued: Based on the significant improvements made by various local election committees in election affairs, this Legislative Yuan election will undoubtedly be more advanced than the previous National Assembly election, and voter participation will be even more enthusiastic.

### Our Technical Delegation Meets with U.S. Officials to Begin Discussions on Aid to China Plan

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] The Chinese technical delegation to the United States met with officials from the U.S. State Department and several economic experts here tonight, officially commencing discussions on U.S. aid to China. Marshall was not present. After the brief meeting on the 19th, Ambassador Gu stated: Officials from the State Department, led by Assistant Secretary of State Thorp, have fully agreed with the delegation's opinion that the proposed aid plan must be implemented as soon as possible to address the serious situation in China. The meeting on the 19th was a "courtesy call" for exchanging greetings and opinions. Pei Tsu-yi, the head of our delegation, stated that preparations for our technical side to immediately meet and discuss the aid plan have now been completed. It is reported here that the aid plan, drafted earlier by the State Department, will be submitted to Congress after discussions with the Chinese delegation. The exact scope and nature of U.S. aid to China will not be announced until Congress receives the State Department's request. According to previous reports, the total amount of the request will be approximately $300 million. Ambassador Gu attended today's meeting, along with five members of our delegation: Pei Tsu-yi, Li Choh-ming, Hong Shen, Chen Liangfu, and Zhu Baozhen. In addition to Thorp, the U.S. officials present included Walter Butterworth, Director of the Office of Far Eastern Affairs, Haldore Hanson, Director of the Office of Investments and Economic Development, and Sloss, Assistant Chief of the China Desk. The Chinese delegation was hosted for lunch at the government guesthouse by Thorp on the 19th. Ambassador Gu, Zheng Shaohua, and Chen Zhi-mai were also present.

Although our delegation is prepared to visit Secretary Marshall, the exact date has not yet been confirmed, but it is expected to occur soon. It is rumored here that the Chinese representatives will have the opportunity to study the State Department's aid to China plan in advance. The plan has been under study since last April and is expected to be submitted to Congress in a few days.

### Kung Hsiang-hsi Issues Statement: U.S. Aid to China is Self-Help; Adopts Gold Standard for Currency Reform

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th, United Press] Kung Hsiang-hsi told United Press that he believes a $1 billion loan will be sufficient as a reserve for stabilizing China's new currency, and currency stability is the foundation for China's recovery. He stated that the loan can be repaid over 15 to 20 years, which is a step towards revitalizing China's ailing economy. Kung explained that in the past, China could rely on exports and remittances from overseas Chinese to maintain its currency stability. These overseas remittances totaled $200 million annually. However, today, there is a scarcity of goods and commodities in China, resulting in hoarding and inflation. Inflation has increased the national budget, which in turn has further inflated the currency. The only solution to this problem is to recall the old currency and issue a new currency with gold as a solid foundation. Regarding where this $1 billion will be borrowed from, Kung stated, "As far as I know, Chinese officials have not yet discussed this matter because China is not yet prepared to present adequate reasons." However, Kung continued to warn: "Currently, there is much talk about U.S. aid to China. We welcome this expression of friendship simply because China is currently exerting all its efforts to eradicate a scourge that will soon threaten the United States. During the war, China received military assistance from the United States. Today, China needs ammunition to continue its suppression campaign. The United States may recognize its interest in avoiding this threat because U.S. aid to China is actually self-help." Kung also quoted a Chinese proverb, "Pulling one hair affects the whole body." He continued: "The situation in China is similar because the world is one family. Internal turmoil in China affects the entire world. Therefore, for the benefit of the world, and especially for the benefit of the United States (because the United States has much to gain or lose in this regard), the internal turmoil in China should be quelled."

### Lucas Urges Aid to China; Advocates Expanding New Army Training Plan; Barr Scheduled to Depart from the U.S. for China

[United Press, Washington, 20th] Major General Lucas, former head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in China, declared here on the 20th: "The Chinese National Government is fighting for survival. He strongly urges expanding the U.S. military delegation to provide practical combat skills training to President Chiang's soldiers." Lucas continued, "The Chinese Communists are not a 'political party' but an armed 'nation' that often strikes at the vital points of the Chinese army in battles against the National Army." Lucas strongly refuted reports of corruption among officials in the National Government as "exaggerated" and "superficial," urging aid to the National Government regardless of whether it undertakes reforms before resolving the civil war. Lucas declined to elaborate on the aid to China plan, saying, "This is a matter for those above my position." However, in military terms, he said that he supports expanding the plan to train Chinese divisions, which began in Taiwan. He also stated that what is currently needed is a new soldier rotation training program to teach Chinese soldiers how to shoot and march. He advocates expanding this plan, which is currently under consideration by the highest authorities. Lucas warned that the military situation in China is rapidly deteriorating, and the equipment of the Chinese Communists is superior to that of the Japanese army. Lucas pointed out that the current policy of the U.S. State Department is limited to the scope of the plan proposed by the U.S. for China, which is only to train Chinese instructors. However, he strongly expressed his belief that U.S. Army personnel should directly supervise Chinese troops on the battlefield. Lucas said he has not seen direct evidence that the Chinese Communists are supplied with equipment by the Soviet Union, but he stated that the Communist leaders are the same type of people trained in the same schools. It is noted that Lucas, who has been in China for nearly two years, will be replaced by Major General Barr in his position in China. Barr is scheduled to fly to China on the 22nd to take up his new post.

### Troop Training in Taiwan Yields Excellent Results

[United Press, Fengshan, Taiwan] Both the Chinese and American military authorities in Taiwan say that the Chinese troop training program under General Sun Liren, with the advice of the U.S. 26th Military Command, is very successful. This achievement is due to the efforts of the Chinese themselves, with the Americans only acting as advisors.

The scale of the new troop training program is not yet known, but U.S. military spokesmen estimate that Taiwan can train 200,000 new troops if all the original Japanese facilities are fully utilized. Currently, only 20,000 young soldiers from the 215th Division are being trained at the training base near Fengshan, Tainan, which was the base of the Japanese 98th Army.

The American advisors consist of 17 officers and 9 soldiers, led by Colonel Bowling. The American side praised the cooperative spirit of the Chinese side. A high-ranking American military officer commented on the morale of the 115th Division, saying: "The discipline of this division can be compared with that of any excellent army in the world."

Sun Liren's assistants are all officers from the famous New 1st Army. Despite the scarcity of materials, they are training under realistic combat conditions. Cavalry training will also begin this month.

The military training center has its own industrial support. The physical fitness of individual soldiers is especially emphasized during training, and they receive the same physical training as regular American soldiers.

### Radford Succeeds Badger as Commander of U.S. Pacific Fleet; Cooke Scheduled to Return to U.S. via Shanghai in Early February

[United Press, Washington, 19th] The Navy Department announced today that Badger has been appointed commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet (i.e., the Seventh Fleet) to succeed Cooke.

### Wei Lihuang Flies to Shenyang Today; Visited the President Three Times Yesterday for Instructions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] Wei Lihuang, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Suppression of Bandits, is scheduled to fly to Shenyang on the 21st by special plane to take up his post. He attended a dinner hosted by Zhang Qun at around 6:00 PM on the 20th and paid his respects to President Chiang three times at 9:00 PM, during which the President gave detailed instructions on the military situation in the Northeast. According to what Wei told our reporter at around 6:00 PM on the 20th, the Northeast suppression of bandits plan will only be finalized after he arrives in Shenyang and meets with Director Chen Cheng and Northeast generals. The rumors that some plans have already been decided are inaccurate. The selection of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Chief of Staff of the Headquarters is also not yet decided. The claim that Guo Jiziao will be appointed as Chief of Staff of the Suppression of Bandits Headquarters is purely a rumor. Wei advocates doing first and then speaking. Before arriving in the Northeast, the situation is not yet clear, so he is reluctant to express more opinions. Wei denied the rumors circulating outside that the Northeast suppression of bandits military operations will adopt a point-based approach in the future, withdrawing from some prominent areas. (News of welcome for Wei from fellow villagers in Beijing and Anhui provinces is on page 3)

### Five Major Cities Expand Food Rationing; Executive Yuan Maintains Original Plan; Preliminary Decision on Purchasing Foreign Rice

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The issue of expanding food rationing in the five major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou was raised for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 20th. Two differing opinions were expressed during the meeting. One side advocated maintaining the original plan, while the other side opposed it. Since the treatment of civil and military personnel has been equalized, but the rationing of food has not mentioned military personnel, it is somewhat unfair. At the same time, after the expansion of rationing in the five cities, will the rest of the country also implement it? Otherwise, it would not be universal. If all were to be rationed, could the food source be resolved? Their intention was to delay the implementation. However, after discussion, it was unanimously agreed that it was not necessary to reverse the decision, and that cultural figures have more difficult lives and the original plan should be maintained. However, no conclusion was reached. The Budget Committee of the Executive Yuan continued to discuss it on the afternoon of the 20th, and then decided to maintain the original plan. It is heard that the Ministry of Food will invite relevant agencies on the 23rd to discuss the amount of food to be rationed and determine its price so that it can be implemented as soon as possible.

### North China Petition Delegation Busy Negotiating in Nanjing; Will Attend Central Standing Committee Meeting to Report Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 20th] The North China Petition Delegation split into two groups on the 20th to negotiate with relevant parties.

Chen invited the delegation to attend the Central Standing Committee meeting on the 21st to give a report. In addition, industry and commerce representatives Li Zhuchen and Ji Dianchuan went to the United Relief Headquarters. Secretary-General Xu Baiyuan was absent due to illness, and Chief Secretary Chu held talks on his behalf and accepted the petition. At noon, the delegation attended a joint banquet hosted by the Northern Nine Provinces and Cities Relief and Reconstruction Association and the Northern Problem Research Association. At 3:30 PM, the delegation went to the Ministry of Food to discuss the supply of food. Regarding the issue of food transportation permits and money, Minister Yu Feipeng promised to investigate thoroughly and eliminate malpractices. Regarding food production and consumption, after studying the number of food shipments to the North since August last year, based on the December standard, the Ministry of Food estimated that 500,000 bags of flour and 30,000 shi of rice could be shipped to Tianjin per month. However, this amount is far from meeting the needs of the North. The Ministry of Food will propose that the Tianjin-Beijing Allocation Committee should be established immediately to investigate the quantity of food required and prepare for allocation based on certificates. The Northern representatives believe that no matter how the Northern food problem is solved, the source of food must be guaranteed without depletion or interruption, and they requested attention to the regularity of the supply. As for importing foreign grain with foreign exchange earned from exports, it involves the entire foreign exchange policy and remains to be discussed with the financial authorities. They were quite busy on the 20th. The planned talks with the Ministries of Finance and Economics could not be held due to time constraints. They will visit the relevant authorities for consultation on the afternoon of the 21st.

### Hong Kong Government Denies Forced Eviction of Chinese Residents in Kowloon City

[Reuters News Agency, Hong Kong Dispatch of the 20th] If the Kowloon City problem is not resolved quickly, Xiamen and Shantou may also see demonstrations against Britain. Guangzhou sailors have decided to boycott British ships if the Hong Kong side evicts Chinese residents staying in Kowloon City again. Similar resolutions may also be made in Shantou and other ports. The British Douglas Steamship Company has ships regularly traveling between Hong Kong, Shantou, and Xiamen, and Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships also frequently dock at these two ports. However, Hong Kong officials have denied that they will forcibly evict residents staying in Kowloon City on the 21st. It is expected that the Hong Kong authorities will not take this measure until an agreement is reached between the Chinese and British officials.

### Joint Logistics Headquarters Plans to Improve Military Food; Maintaining the Same Quality and Quantity

### Editorial: A New Dawn of Peace in Asia

In the current turbulent world situation, the news from some parts of Asia that a new basis for peaceful cooperation has been achieved in those regions is very gratifying. These regions of Asia certainly do not refer to all of Asia; but when we think of these regions, due to the complexity of their background and the depth of their struggles, they can now obtain a basis for peaceful cooperation. This makes us place our earnest expectations on the arrival of these good news. Needless to say, the good news from these regions is, first, that Gandhi's hunger strike has resulted in a basis for peaceful cooperation among the Indian, Muslim, and Sikh communities; and second, the agreement between Indonesia and the Netherlands. The Indonesian question and the dispute between India and Pakistan, and the resulting massacre of Indians, Muslims, and Sikhs, are known to be difficult problems to solve: Now all parties have reached an agreement, and there is not only a way to solve them, but also a vision of peace in Asia. In this international situation, the arrival of this news has a stabilizing effect.

Regarding India, since the British withdrew from India and the establishment of the "Dominions" of the Indian Federation and Pakistan, the world's expectations for these two new states have, undeniably, been close to disillusionment due to the massacres between them. Not long after the birth of these two new states, riots and massacres broke out, and tens of thousands of Indians and Muslims bled to death; fields were barren, and people were plunged into misery. Since the Kashmir incident, India and Pakistan have been on the verge of war, appealing to the United Nations for mediation, while both sides are carrying out the massacre of innocent people within their borders. The situation is unprecedentedly tragic. In this situation, the 78-year-old Mahatma Gandhi resumed his hunger strike to call for peace and proposed a seven-point cooperation plan: 1. Allow Muslims to hold religious festivals near Delhi every year; 2. Muslims who fled to Pakistan should be allowed to return to Delhi safely; 3. The 117 mosques occupied by Hindus during the September riots should be returned to the Muslims; 4. Guarantee the safety of Muslims everywhere in Delhi; 5. Cancel the Sikh boycott of Muslims; 6. Guarantee that Muslims can travel safely on trains; and 7. Indian and Sikh refugees must not occupy the Muslim areas of Delhi.

After Gandhi proposed this cooperation plan, he immediately began his hunger strike on the 12th. After six days, this plan was accepted by all parties, and the Mahatma stopped his hunger strike at 12:45 PM on the 18th. This 122-hour hunger strike is reported to have achieved the following victories: 1. India agreed to restore financial payments to Pakistan; 2. Indian officials all promised to promote good relations between the dominions; 3. For the first time since September last year, residents of New Delhi allowed a large number of Muslims to walk on the streets; 4. The 117 mosques in New Delhi occupied by Sikh and Hindu refugees have been voluntarily returned; 5. The Sindh City Council in Pakistan promised to improve relations between India and Muslims; and 6. Shivaksha Singh, the leader of the Hindu extremist faction, one of the main figures who caused anti-Muslim disputes in New Delhi, agreed to abide by Gandhi's peace proposal. At the same time, according to news from Lake Success, India and Pakistan have also accepted the mediation of the United Nations on the Kashmir issue, and neither side shall have talks or measures that could make the situation worse. It is due to Gandhi's hunger strike that a stabilizing effect has been produced on the Indian situation.

As for the situation in Indonesia, it has not been resolved since the Japanese surrender. Although there was the Linggadjati Agreement, the ink of the agreement was not dry, and the bloodshed occurred again. Dutch troops have attacked Indonesian troops. However, the Dutch authorities, observing the current turbulent international situation, and knowing that the best use of soldiers is not to use them, have not pressed on after obtaining some victories. On the one hand, they used the United Nations organization, and through the United Nations Commission, proposed six reconciliation clauses, which were accepted by both Indonesia and the Netherlands on the 19th of this month. This agreement stipulates that the future of the Indonesian Sultanate will be determined by a national referendum. Although this vote may not be held this year, the signing of this agreement undoubtedly has established a foundation for clarifying the situation in Indonesia; from this foundation, the Indonesian question will surely be fully resolved.

Due to the arrival of this news, in addition to expressing our congratulations to India, Pakistan, and Indonesia, we cannot help but feel many emotions. First, the Indian, Muslim, and Sikh families only failed to treat each other with sincerity due to years of suspicion between them. As a result, the birth of the two new states was followed by bloodshed. Gandhi's hunger strike enabled the three parties to abandon suspicion, return to good terms. This shows the greatness of Gandhi's spiritual appeal, and also the ability of the three parties to prioritize the welfare of the people, show attention to the overall situation, and abandon prejudices. It must be known that the Indian, Muslim, and Sikh people not only have different religious beliefs, but also have very different lifestyles. Suspicion and jealousy have been around for a long time. Now that they can return to good terms, it is because they understand their great ambitions and can put the people's interests first; due to the establishment of this agreement, the dark future has turned into light. Second, when it comes to Indonesia and the Netherlands, there was originally a relationship between ruler and ruled; now, the Dutch government, knowing the difficulties of the times, does not go too far. This is enough to show the enlightened policy of the Hague government, and the ability of the Indonesian Republic authorities to prioritize the overall situation and finally reach an agreement is commendable. Third, due to the renewed stability in India and Indonesia, reflecting on our domestic situation, it makes us realize that the reason why our country's situation has not yet achieved a stable foundation is that we have bandits who do not prioritize national interests and do not care about the overall situation who are creating chaos. The Indian, Muslim, and Sikh people have differences in religious beliefs and lifestyles, and Indonesia and the Netherlands have differences in race and culture, but they can all reach an agreement and lay a new foundation for future cooperation; only our Communists have no differences in race, culture, or lifestyle, but they do not care about the overall situation and raise troops to create chaos. For the sake of our nation's survival, we should make the suppression of the rebellion complete as soon as possible; then it is the responsibility of every citizen to actively mobilize and participate in their respective positions. Only after the suppression of the rebellion is successfully completed can we have a stable new foundation.

### U.S. State Department Officially Announces Aid to Europe Fund Allocation Table: Numbers Listed Still Need to be Reconfirmed

[U.S. News Service Washington Dispatch on the 20th] The State Department today released a statement on the allocation of funds for the 15-month fund under the European Recovery Program from April 1, but pointed out that the final decision will be made by the executor of the program. This statement was prepared by U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas in his testimony to the House Foreign Affairs Committee today for submission to Congress. The State Department explained that the numbers in the table refer to the plans of various countries, or will be decided by the executors after considering all relevant factors. The table shows that the total needs of 16 European countries and the western United States are US$12.9 billion. U.S. dollar income is estimated at US$4.9 billion, and income that may be obtained from outside the United States is US$200 million. In addition, the estimated total amount of new U.S. funds is US$6.8 billion. A statement is also attached to the table, stating that it is currently impossible to complete an accurate representation of each plan. This representation reflects the inputs that need to be obtained from the Western Hemisphere, and the sources of funds required for these inputs. The statement said: Constant adjustments are necessary to take into account factors such as the degree of success of each country's production efforts, changes in the supply of world materials, price dynamics, financial measures of countries that do not participate in the European Recovery Program, and the amount of loans lent by institutions such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Below is the distribution of economic assistance to each country participating in the European Recovery Program based on the price estimate on July 1, 1947:

### Baruch Presents a Plan to Congress to Ensure World Peace

[U.S. News Service Washington Dispatch on the 19th] Bernard Baruch, a well-known financier and presidential advisor during World War II, presented a plan to Congress today to "develop a global peace strategy." He estimates that the basis of economic stability can be established within two years, provided that: production efforts similar to those during wartime are implemented in peacetime. The eleven points in the plan are as follows: (1) In the next five years, the United States should purchase all raw materials produced by anyone anywhere in the world that cannot be sold in the normal commercial market without spoiling. (2) Extend the President's current powers related to tariffs for three years. (3) European countries should unite under the United Nations to form a political and economic union. (4) The United States and other countries that will participate should mutually guarantee that countries participating in this alliance will resist aggression. (5) European countries should organize, develop, and utilize all European production resources, and the resources in the Ruhr region should be regulated with priority and international control. (6) Stabilize the currency of all of Europe and establish practical exchange rates. (7) Promote a two-year production movement in the United States, and overcome the slowdown in production with longer working hours. (8) The United States should implement an anti-inflation plan, which will include restoring excess profits tax, delaying tax reductions, and giving priority to construction that will increase production. (9) Actually clear all pre-war and wartime intergovernmental debts. (10) The United Kingdom and other countries should continue to retain imperial priority for three years. (11) Establish a headquarters for peace work to formulate a global strategy that transcends everything.

### Aid to Europe is a Step Towards Peace: The United States is Helping Europe Regain Health, Dulles Said to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee

[United Press Washington Dispatch on the 20th] John Foster Dulles, U.S. Representative to the United Nations and Republican foreign policy expert, declared to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today that the Marshall Plan for European Recovery is a step towards peace. The United States cannot survive permanently if it merely adheres to its privileges in an environment of human suffering. The wartime wounds of the free countries of Europe are now gradually healing, but the Soviet leaders are trying to make them fatally wounded by all methods other than war. Unless the United States helps these countries regain their health, the Soviet leaders' attempts may succeed. The purpose of the Marshall Plan is to do just that.

### Socialist Party Congress Ends: Katayama Succeeds as Chairman: Major Changes in Internal Forces Can Be Avoided

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo Dispatch on the 20th] The final day of the Japanese Socialist Party Congress went smoothly in the program of electing the highest personnel. On the issue of the party leader, the left and right factions seemed to have reached a compromise. The left wing did not nominate Matsumoto to run for election, so Tetsu Katayama safely succeeded as chairman. Although Kato Juji and Asanuma Inejiro competed for the position of Secretary-General, because the four-party policy agreement had been abolished, the left and right also expressed concessions in personnel matters, so Asanuma, as a centrist, replaced Nishio as Secretary-General. From the results of this personnel election, major changes in the internal forces of the Socialist Party were avoided.

### U.S. Absolute Security Only Achieved by Abolishing War: Conclusions Reached by U.S. Military and Political Leaders

[United Press International, Washington, 19th] Washington officials' observations on the current world crisis clearly reflect the belief that U.S. security depends on non-military measures to prevent another war. This is the conclusion reached by government leaders and experts. For several days, congressional committees have been listening to serious reports from Secretary of State Marshall, Secretary of Defense Forrestal, and Secretary of the Army Royal. The President has also received a report from the Aviation Policy Board. These reports, taken together, lead to the unanimous conclusion that war is possible, and the true security of the United States lies in preventing it through political and economic actions. However, the Aviation Policy Board also stated: "Based on initial impressions, a major war is unlikely to occur within the next five years. The highest military authorities have expressed this view to the Board." At no time in American history during peacetime, not even in the weeks before the Pearl Harbor attack, has Washington been so concerned about the crisis of war as it is today. Ways to prevent war, especially the impact if the U.S. cannot prevent war, are preoccupying government officials and those close to the government more than any other issue. The Aviation Policy Board's report stated: "Protecting ourselves through military armaments can only provide the United States with relative security. The second best option is to obtain security through treaties. The absolute security of the United States can only be achieved by abolishing war." Forrestal told the House Committee that it would be a mistake to build a strong defense force to replace aid to Europe, as it would only create an "armed truce." Eleanor Roosevelt, recently returned from a trip to Europe, told the National Women's Press Club that the Soviet Union would attack the United States' policies as soon as they found an opportunity. The Soviet Union only respects strength, and the United States must be strong. However, Mrs. Roosevelt also emphasized the importance of avoiding war, stating that this is the true guarantee of U.S. security. In summary, one can no longer hope to escape the material effects of war, or even win in another war. The Aviation Policy Board's report also stated: "We must consider the possibility that our country may be attacked. We must assume that future aggressors will not allow the United States to mobilize its industrial power. To win, we must destroy them with a preemptive strike." The board expects that the United States will not be able to catch up by the end of 1952. After 1952, Americans must assume that other countries have created atomic weapons that can be used against the United States. The opinions of Marshall, Forrestal, and Royal were all presented during the congressional debate on the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe.

### Agreement Reached on Distribution of Italian Ships: Soviet Union to Receive One-Third

### Bomb Thrown During Gandhi's Speech: Homemade Bomb Causes No Injuries

### Britain Establishes Trade Policy to Save Dollars and Expand Markets: Currently Negotiating Trade Agreements with Seven European Countries

[Reuters, London, 19th] British Trade Minister Wilson reported today at a press conference on Britain's trade relations with seven European countries: Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Yugoslavia, and Switzerland. Details are as follows: Denmark: British-Danish trade negotiations are continuing. Britain has been able to supply coal to Denmark, and will exchange it for some minor items needed by Britain.

The price difference between the two parties is close, and the negotiations are expected to be optimistic. Netherlands: Dutch and British trade negotiations were held in London last month. The lists of goods offered by both sides are under review, and negotiations can resume in The Hague in early February. Belgium: British-Belgian negotiations are currently being held in London. Trade between the two countries is expected to increase significantly this year. Switzerland: Britain has recently begun negotiations with Switzerland. British exports to Switzerland are about three times the imports from Switzerland. Yugoslavia: British negotiations with Yugoslavia began in August last year. The leader of the Yugoslav delegation, Kop Kopke, has not returned to London after returning to Belgrade for instructions. The British side expects that some agreements can be reached soon. Czechoslovakia: Britain hopes to determine the date for the start of trade negotiations with Czechoslovakia soon, but the two sides are already discussing the necessities and possible supplies. Finland: The Finnish trade delegation is scheduled to come to Britain on February 16 to review the entire issue of trade payments between the two countries. Wilson continued: The most important markets for the British government are Canada, the United States, and Argentina. The government has ordered exporters to pay special attention to the development of these three countries in order to earn U.S. dollars. The goal of Britain's foreign trade negotiations is to obtain the necessary imports while using as little of Britain's gold and dollar reserves as possible. The concept of international trade based solely on the exchange of major commodities is extremely disadvantageous to Britain. At the same time, Britain will seek to remove restrictions imposed by other countries on British imports.

### Mediation of Kashmir Dispute: Agreement Reached by Indian and Pakistani Representatives; Security Council's Tripartite Commission to Participate in Mediation

[This newspaper's report] New York, 20th Broadcast: Lake Success Report, The Security Council today passed a resolution to send a tripartite commission to Kashmir to mediate the India-Pakistan dispute. Nine votes were in favor, with the Soviet Union and Ukraine abstaining.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 20th] The Security Council will meet at 3:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on the 20th to continue discussing the Kashmir issue, and will review the compromise reached by the Indian and Pakistani representatives after holding secret round table meetings over the weekend.

[U.S. News Agency, Lake Success, 19th] The representatives of India and Pakistan to the United Nations are considering the Security Council's proposal on the 19th to establish a three-person mediation commission to help resolve the Kashmir dispute. This proposal was put forward by the President of the Security Council, Belgian representative Langenhove, and its formation will be similar to the tripartite commission mediating the India-Netherlands dispute.

[United Press International, New Delhi, 19th] Gandhi said today that he was deeply grateful for the telegrams sent by various countries around the world after he ended his hunger strike, and would always remember them.

### British Economic Crisis: Situation Becomes Severe; U.S. Aid to Europe Seems Too Late

[Associated Press, London, 20th] Senior British government officials warned on the 20th that Britain's gold and dollar reserves will reach a "dangerous stage" before July, and the standard of living will have to be "terribly curtailed" if Marshall's aid does not arrive. The depletion of dollars and gold is "extremely dangerous," despite efforts to curb foreign exchange expenditures since last month. The gap between income and expenditure has narrowed, but unless "we can take steps to curb and further reduce our gold and dollar reserves, the most serious situation seems likely to develop." Some believe that the Marshall Plan is too late for the 1948 economic plan to directly aid Britain.

### Italy and Switzerland Sign Trade Agreement

[Reuters, Rome, 20th] It was officially announced that the Italian-Swedish trade agreement will be signed on the 20th at the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The representatives of both sides signing the agreement will be Italian Foreign Minister Sforza and Swedish Envoy to Italy Gengde.

### Legislative Elections Begin Today: Starting and Ending Whistles Sound; Chief Wu of the Election Committee Solemnly Casts the First Vote; General Speculation is That Yen Hui-Ching Will Be Elected

"Report from Our Newspaper" The city's first legislative election is scheduled to begin simultaneously at 8:00 a.m. today at 156 polling stations. The voting time is set for three days. On the first and second days, the voting will be from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. On the third day, it will be half a day, from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. If there are special reasons, the director of the polling station may change the time with the consent of the supervisor, but the voting time must not be less than ten hours on the first and second days, and not less than four hours on the third day. Each factory will sound its whistle at the same time at the beginning and end of each day to ensure uniformity. During the voting, committee members Guo Zhen, Wu Kaixian, and Chen Baotai will personally inspect the polling stations, and dispatch a general supervisor, inspectors, polling station directors, and staff to manage the various duties. The police bureau will also send police officers to assist in maintaining order and protecting the ballots. Chief Wu Guozhen will personally cast the first vote at the Zhaoguang Middle School, the third polling station in the Changshu District, at 8:00 a.m. today. It is speculated that Yen Hui-Ching will be elected. Yesterday, various campaign activities in the city were unusually lively. In addition to campaign speeches held everywhere, leaflets and slogans with novel wording were posted everywhere to attract the attention of voters. There were also large trucks with huge red crosses, with the names of the candidates and words of support written on them, passing through the bustling city with drums. The legislative candidates Fang Zhichao, Lu Jingshi, Zheng Yuxiu, Wang Xinheng, and Lu Meiseng devoted the most effort to their campaign propaganda. Government official Yen Hui-Ching is generally speculated to have a very high ranking in the election, but has not been seen engaging in public campaign activities.

### Election Preparation Work Intense: Three Methods Decided for Troop Voting

The election affairs office in this city is working intensely to prepare for the general election. This morning at 9:00 a.m., a discussion meeting was held with the organizers of the legislative elections in various districts. More than ten organizers from Hongkou, Gaoqiao, and other districts attended. Zhang Xiaosong presided over the meeting, and Bao Lie, chief of staff of the garrison headquarters, attended to discuss the issue of troop voting. The following three points were decided: 1. Soldiers voting in the troops originally needed to affix a photo to their election certificates. Now, due to the actual difficulties in obtaining photos, if there is no photo, an election certificate will be issued after verifying the symbol. 2. Except for the officers and soldiers of the garrison headquarters who will vote at the Shanyin Road 17th District Central National School polling station in the Zhongbei Sichuan Road District, the remaining troops will vote at their garrison. 3. The voting of security police will be handled in the same way as troop voting, verifying the election right certificate photo or symbol. Administrative police and voluntary police still need to have both an election right certificate and a national identity card, neither of which can be missing. Polling stations for troops in various districts have also been designated.

"Another Report" In order to strictly handle the legislative elections in various districts and occupational groups, Mayor Wu has specially dispatched four chief advisors: Wang Zhaoyu, Wang Guanting, Shen Naizheng, and Lin Kexin, to patrol and supervise the voting areas.

Meticulous Voting Procedures

Each polling station is marked with the words "Shanghai City, Legislative Yuan Legislator, Polling Station for District X, Bao X (or Group X)," and the implementation rules are posted in large characters inside the station. On both sides of the entrance, depending on the number of voters, there are several ballot issuing stations. Voters line up in order of arrival and verify their election right certificates and national identity cards (group elections do not need verification), and sign, stamp, or press their thumbprint on the voter list. After the administrator verifies that there are no discrepancies, the ballot, election right certificate, and national identity card are returned.

Those Who Cannot Read May Ask Someone to Mark on Their Behalf

The ballot writing station is equipped with multiple sets of pens and inkstones, and the names of the candidates and the standards for recognizing factory votes are posted in large characters. If voters cannot read, they are allowed to ask other voters in the station to mark on their behalf. If no voters are available to mark on their behalf, they may ask the administrator to mark on their behalf under the supervision of the inspector, and note the serial number of the election right certificate in the lower right corner of the ballot and press their right thumbprint. A ballot box is set up in the voting booth. Before voting, the supervisor, together with the voting administrator and the inspector, publicly opens the ballot box for inspection. If there are cracks, the supervisor seals it with the polling station seal, and appoints three inspectors to seal the drawer with the seal issued by the general office, and sign on the seal to confirm the date of sealing. The sealing procedure for the box lid is the same after the voting is completed each day. If voters deem it necessary, they may legally elect nine to fifteen representatives to prepare seals with their signatures and stamps to seal the box. After the voting is completed each day, the supervisor and the inspector check whether the number of ballots issued matches the number of ballots received, and then seal the remaining ballots until they are unsealed when voting begins the next day. The ballot boxes are kept centrally by district and group. The director of the polling station should appoint several designated administrators, and consult with the inspector to elect one representative to jointly manage the ballot boxes.

### Military Friends Restaurant: Operating as a Dance Business; Social Bureau Orders Correction

"Report from Our Newspaper" The Social Bureau previously noted that with the dance ban imminent, the city's Military Friends Restaurant has dance floor and music equipment, and non-Military Friends Association members can also enter to dance. The waitress introduces dance hostesses, and the customers pay for the dance, so its nature is actually a disguised commercial dance hall.

"Report from Our Newspaper" Regarding the technical problems of implementing the dance hall ban, the Social Bureau convened a meeting with the responsible persons of the dance hall association yesterday.

He also cited the example of the National League dance hall on Guangxi Road, which automatically closed and then operated as a brothel. The dance ban only made the industry more degenerate, which should be considered by the authorities. The Social Bureau stated that the government had already stipulated the measures for the dance ban and would naturally implement the order. Therefore, it still instructed the association to convene a meeting within a few days to discuss the issue of delayed lottery drawing and submit a report for approval.

### Actual Municipal Finances Have Shrunk More Than Before the War in the Last Two Years

"Report from Our Newspaper" The local financial situation of the city in the two years before and after the war has been compared by the Finance Bureau using the devaluation method in statistics, comparing the income and expenditure figures with the wholesale price index, in order to understand the actual increase or decrease in income and expenditure. The prices of various commodities in the city have increased significantly in the past ten years, and the financial income and expenditure figures are closely related to prices, because some taxes are calculated ad valorem, and expenditures are of course affected by prices and wages. According to the analysis results, if the income and expenditure of the 25th year are set as 100, then the devaluation number of the income ratio in the 35th year is 30, and the devaluation number of the expenditure ratio is 33. The devaluation number of the income ratio in the 36th year is 39, and the devaluation number of the expenditure ratio is 36. It can be seen that the actual value of the current income and expenditure is much less than before the war. However, the income and expenditure in the 36th year have made considerable progress compared to the previous year. Throughout the 36th year, the monthly income and expenditure situation was able to keep pace with prices, which should be attributed to the positive consolidation of taxation. If the annual average of the 35th year is set as 100, then the best month for income in the 36th year was October, with 147, and the lowest was June, with 71. For expenditures, the highest was January, with 168, and the lowest was June, with 64.

### Improving Civil Servants' Living Standards; How is the Index Compiled?

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] After repeated appeals from the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Senate, the method of paying civil and military officials based on the cost of living index, the adjustment plan of the Public Education Personnel Treatment Committee under the direction of the Accounting Office and the Special Review Committee designated by the State Council, has met and discussed many times, and after many twists and turns, it was approved at the regular meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 13th of this month and is being implemented. Although it is being piloted based on the December cost of living index and is only adjusted every three months, it is generally more reasonable to adjust according to the rise and fall of the cost of living index than the previous method of adding a few percentage points, and it is hoped that it will gradually improve after the trial of adjusting according to the cost of living index. Regarding the meaning of the civil servants' cost of living index and its compilation process, the reporter visited Xu Kan, the chief of the Accounting Office, and Zhao Zhang[blank], the deputy director of the Statistics Bureau, and only after two hours of talk did they thoroughly understand.

Cost of Living Index: The National Government's Accounting Office selects 28 kinds of daily necessities required for civil servants and investigates their prices. Then, with reference to the household survey and the standards of health and nutrition, it determines the minimum quantity of various daily necessities required by an adult male civil servant each month, such as two dou of rice, three feet of cloth, etc. These are called weights, which are multiplied by their respective prices and added together to obtain the total consumption value. According to the weighted total value formula, the total consumption value of the current period is divided by the total consumption value of the base period to obtain the total ratio, which is the civil servants' cost of living index.

For example: In the first half of 1937, the average total consumption value of each adult male in Nanjing was 15 yuan and 4 cents per month. In September 1947, the total consumption value in Nanjing increased to 543,350 yuan and 19 cents, and the cost of living index was 36,127.01 times.

Items Adopted: The names, qualities, units of calculation, and weights of the civil servants' cost of living index are as follows:

The items and quantities selected in the "Measures to Improve the Living Standards of Civil Servants in Extraordinary Times" are only general necessities and represent the minimum living standards for civil servants, but their standards are based on something. For example, in terms of food: This is similar to the food standards required for the nutrients of civil servants proposed by the Central Health Experiment Institute. The Institute proposed 29 catties of grains, 37.5 catties of vegetables, 15 catties of tofu, 5.5 catties of meat, 30 eggs, and 45 taels of oil.

According to the method of investigating the cost of living index of civil servants, the results of the cost of living index of civil servants compiled by the Accounting Office are generally lower than the wholesale or retail price index of the same month and place. For example:

From the example above, the retail price index in Nanjing in September 1947 was more than 43,900 times that before the war, and the [blank] wholesale price index was also more than 43,000 times that before the war, but the civil servants' cost of living index was only more than 36,000 times. The reason for the difference here, according to the people who compiled the civil servants' cost of living index, is that the [blank] wholesale price index includes the prices of five [blank] and construction materials, and the retail price index includes some recreational or luxury goods, and the types of goods are also more numerous, representing a wider range, while the civil servants' cost of living index only includes 28 kinds of the most frugal necessities, and is subject to weighted restrictions. For example, the prices of clothing are higher than those of other categories, but the monthly demand is only three feet, which does not have a great impact on the cost of living index. This is why the civil servants' cost of living index is lower than the [blank] wholesale or retail price index. (Reporter Zou Keding)

### Full Picture of Gansu's Economic Development

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 14th] During the War of Resistance, many people who rarely left their homes became long-distance travelers, gaining much knowledge and experience, which could be considered an unexpected gain. Take reporters as an example. Although I spent the past eight years circling around the southwestern provinces, I have indeed increased a lot of knowledge. Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to go to the Northwest, which I could not help but yearn for. However, I always thought of these remote areas as windy and barren. With such difficult transportation and such a bustling life, I recently had the opportunity to visit Lanzhou due to a sudden event. I stayed in the new-style Northwest Building and strolled around Zhongshan, Zhongzheng, Zuo Gong Roads. All my feelings were the opposite of what I had imagined, which can be considered a rare opportunity for me.

Gansu is a poor province with vast land, sparse population, and limited production. However, the provincial capital of Lanzhou has been developed to the point where it can keep pace with the times. The Provincial Machinery Factory, Chemical Materials Factory, Coal Mine, Water Conservancy Bureau, Transportation Office, and Waterworks have all been successfully established one after another. This proves that those in charge have a spirit of hard work. General Guo Jijiang, the chairman of Gansu Province, is from Hefei, Anhui. The times require him to work hard here. The most appropriate work in a place with a large land and a small population is production and construction. General Guo has recognized this point and is working hard. He said that the construction of political, cultural, psychological and other departments must start with the economic construction of people's livelihood. Otherwise, it is impossible to talk about coordination with national defense construction. General Guo is very interested in this and has the greatest determination and confidence. He has formulated a very detailed plan for the entire Gansu Province's production and construction, and is preparing to complete the following economic construction plan within one year. I believe that the people of the country will definitely give it attention and support.

General Principles (1) The economic construction of this province aims to develop people's livelihood and meet national defense needs. Equal emphasis is placed on agricultural income and industrial and mining industries - increasing agricultural and animal husbandry production and promoting the prosperity of the rural economy as the foundation of industrial and mining enterprises; and advancing industrial and mining enterprises as a means of improving agricultural management and improving people's lives. The basic industry and people's livelihood industries complement each other and progress simultaneously - the development of people's livelihood industries (clothing, food, housing, daily transportation, education, and culture) guarantees the establishment of basic industries (mining, machinery, power); and the expansion of basic industries is fundamental to increasing production and enriching national defense. Close cooperation between public, private and cooperative methods - large-scale public enterprises serve as a model for improving technical standards and developing markets outside the province, while assisting and encouraging the development of private enterprises. Actively promote cooperation to enable the majority of farmers and small handicraftsmen to directly manage production, sales, distribution and other businesses.

(2) The economic construction of this province should mobilize the province's human, material and financial resources, advance in an orderly manner according to a certain plan, and strive to use external assistance to achieve continuous results. The unification of financial, monetary and economic measures - finance assists finance, finance promotes the economy, and the economy enriches finance. The aim is to achieve a consistent and flexible application, with responsible at each level and assistance and guidance at each level - each district and county should formulate construction plans based on the construction program, adapt to local conditions, and take the district and county as a unit. The provincial government will review and assess the plans and be responsible for completing them. The province will provide assistance for talents or resources that cannot be planned independently. Coordinating with national agencies to enhance driving force - relevant departments of the provincial government should study and cooperate with central technical agencies to effectively guide this construction cause; and conduct detailed discussions with national financial institutions and economic construction authorities on investment loans or assistance equipment to increase capital and expand scale. (4) Appeal for foreign investment and technical guidance - In accordance with central government regulations and with reference to the needs of this province, we should welcome international investment and technical talents. Encouraging private individuals to engage in construction - If the government considers a cause necessary and suitable for private operation, it may provide convenience for purchasing land, supplementing equipment, and purchasing, transporting, and selling. The government may also provide the minimum dividend and profit, depending on the province's financial resources. Private inventions should be protected and rewarded. (3) The construction cause needs talents: they should be gradually cultivated to enrich the province's leading talents and middle-level cadres in construction - strive to coordinate education with construction, reward primary school students, send university students to study abroad or fund specialists to study abroad and practice, to cultivate high-level professionals and develop vocational education, and reserve practical technical talents for various departments of economic construction. Special attention should be paid to the training of professionals in transportation, water conservancy, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, chemical engineering, and textiles.

General Construction (1) Transportation construction is a prerequisite for the development of agriculture and industry. In addition to assisting the central government in building the Longhai Railway and the Tianlan and Lan'an sections, 2,000 kilometers of Biao Jin Highway will be completed. The province's major roadways and important waterways will also be repaired and renovated. (2) Water conservancy construction will complete 500,000 mu of irrigation projects. The Hexi section will continue to be carried out according to the 12-year plan. At the same time, 250 million cubic feet of contour trenches will be completed to prevent mountain floods of approximately 3,000 square kilometers. In addition, 500,000 mu of farmland will be covered with sand, and a survey of water conservancy throughout the province will be planned. (3) Agricultural and forestry construction will focus on improving agricultural techniques, including soil and fertilizer improvement, agricultural variety testing and cultivation, pest control, and agricultural tool improvement. We must plan and act simultaneously to increase the yield of major food crops by 15%. At the same time, we will complete the survey of natural forests throughout the province, implement nationalization, and encourage the people to afforest 1,000 square li. In addition, 200 million trees will be planted in rural areas throughout the province, focusing on afforestation of barren mountains. (4) Improve animal husbandry, starting from three aspects: preventing animal diseases, improving breeds, and improving nutrition. Expand the injection of goat blood toxin to prevent rinderpest, and conduct research on livestock parasites and infectious diseases. At the same time, carry out the introduction, experimentation, and promotion of various livestock breeds, protect grasslands, and increase grass production by 10% by using hillside water storage methods, and plan to establish or supplement animal husbandry and medical research institutions. (5) Industry focuses on the establishment of the wool textile industry and the chemical industry, so that it can gradually complete the production of coarse woolen cloth, dairy products, and dried meat. At the same time, promote research on the production and transportation methods of industrial raw materials such as hides, medicinal materials, petroleum by-products, and wild silk. Industries such as papermaking, sugar making, hydropower, fertilizer production, and agricultural tool manufacturing should also be carried out step by step, depending on their urgency. (Wen Xia)

### Suzhou Dajiangnan Newspaper Was Attacked by Thugs Yesterday, Received Strange Calls Beforehand, Left a "Gift" Before Leaving

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 20th] The Dajiangnan Newspaper here was suddenly partially destroyed at 5:30 pm today. Three thugs fled after committing the crime, and their whereabouts are unknown. Fortunately, the editorial, collection, and advertising departments were not affected, and there was no major damage. It will be published as usual tomorrow. Before leaving, they left a cigarette, sealed with paper, with the words "Gift, do not refuse." The police station's criminal police took it away and opened it for inspection. It was actually human feces, and the stench was overwhelming.

According to the person in charge of the newspaper, the incident occurred after several strange calls were received starting in the evening of the 19th. At that time, the person in charge of the newspaper was out. When they returned from outside, colleagues discovered that there were many suspicious men near the gate, watching intently, as if they were paying attention to the entry and exit of personnel. The newspaper staff knew that something was wrong and were on guard. This afternoon, all the councilors in the museum had gone out, and only one staff member was left on duty. The thugs took the opportunity to enter and commit the crime. By the time they heard the noise and went to check, they only saw three thugs in blue short shirts and pants running away. They could not be stopped. As for the reason for the attack, it is difficult to determine. However, the newspaper's objective criticism and sharp satire during the recent legislative elections may have caused dissatisfaction. However, this cannot be used as a basis for dogmatic conclusions. After the incident, the heads of military and political agencies all went to express their condolences and investigate the cause of the attack. It is reported that the newspaper will not only ask the authorities to arrest the perpetrators and punish them severely but will also appeal to the national industry for unified support.

### President Ding of Tongji University Orders Students to Resume Classes This Morning

[Our Report] Regarding the indefinite strike by students at Tongji University, the school held an emergency administrative meeting the day before yesterday and decided on the following measures: Before the school order is stabilized, any activities of the student self-government association of this school are strictly prohibited. All students who are temporarily elected as so-called standing committee members and so-called directors should realize that this move is illegal and voluntarily withdraw from participation. If they do not consider it and continue to accept, it will be a violation of school regulations. The school authorities cannot tolerate it. In order to avoid implicating too many people, we hereby reiterate the previous purpose and issue a final warning, hoping that the so-called standing committee members and directors will seriously consider it and not take any illegal actions again. If they dare to violate it, the school will never tolerate it. During the period when the student self-government association stops activities, if the students have any requests to make to the school authorities, they may be received, but there must be no more acts of coercion and resistance in the form of class boycotts. Each college can send up to one or two representatives, and first submit a written request to the dean's office before arranging a meeting. However, students who have been disciplined cannot serve as representatives. All students in the school should resume classes starting from today. Students who have been expelled or suspended must leave the school within three days.

### Taiwan Province's First Education Conference: Gathering Education Experts from Across the Province to Discuss Qualitative Improvement and Enrichment

[Our Taichung Dispatch, 20th] The first education administration conference of Taiwan Province, aimed at reviewing the successes and failures of the past two years of education and setting standards for future improvement, opened at the Taichung Cultural City. The organizers at least hope that this conference will serve as a national model.

Minister of Education Zhu Jia-hua, focusing on the coordination of education at all levels, delivered a "farewell address" to the more than 200 attendees. He expressed his gratitude and admiration for the dedication of educators who have worked to change the face of education in Taiwan over the past two years. He mentioned the education implemented by the Japanese during their rule in Taiwan, saying: "The oppressive, enslaving education adopted by the Japanese, which harmed our people, must be swiftly cut away. However, we must retain what is useful, incorporate it, and carry it forward." He added that the Japanese achieved a certain scale and foundation during their half-century of stability, which cannot be ignored. He concluded by hoping that the province's education at all levels would be coordinated to serve the country and benefit society.

Zhu recounted his impressions of Taiwan Province over the past five days, saying that while the New Life Movement had been promoted for over a decade in the mainland, the habit of queuing for tickets and boarding vehicles had not been well established. In contrast, the people of Taiwan already had this habit. He said that the various unreasonable phenomena in the mainland were due to instability and needed to be corrected.

Supervisory Commissioner Yang Liang-gong loudly proclaimed that education should not be about producing officials but about cultivating experts and technicians who can contribute to industrial and mining production!

The education conference brought together principals of secondary schools and above from across the province, as well as guests and experts. They came from all over the province, with four-fifths being from the mainland. Minister Zhu expressed his hope that they would compare education in Taiwan with that in the mainland and seek improvements. The conference had 45 proposals, mostly concerning funding and administrative issues.

Funding, salaries, and living conditions also need urgent solutions in Taiwan!

Currently, Taiwan has one national university, three provincial colleges, sixty-eight provincial secondary schools, and one hundred and thirty-two county secondary schools, plus private secondary schools, totaling two hundred and sixteen. The province has: over 240 higher education instructors; 1,906 provincial secondary school instructors; and 15,763 elementary school teachers. There are: over 1,375 higher education students; 59,605 secondary school students; and 843,000 elementary school students.

In terms of quantity, development has reached a considerable stage, with only qualitative improvement and enrichment needed. Indeed, qualitative improvement is urgently needed! The current quantitative development not only fails to conceal the qualitative poverty but also reveals a crisis!

Generally, it is believed that the first education conference will only be a gathering of educators from across the province and will not have good results. Perhaps spending on equipment and facilities would be more effective and practical. However, the Education Bureau has high expectations, as this is, after all, the first conference in more than two years.

Taichung is the most tranquil and beautiful cultural city in the province. The weather these days is mild and sunny, like early spring. Following the provincial games, a three-day education conference is being held here, with displays from various units, making Taichung proud. (Reported by our Special Correspondent, Mu Yun)

### Basketball League Results from Last Night: Qingbai and Changli Succumb to Encas Due to Lack of Endurance; Renyu Overwhelms US Military Police; Chunmao Overcomes Yizhong After Fierce Battle

[Reported by Our Newspaper] There were three matches in the basketball league last night. Although the audience at the Municipal Gymnasium was not crowded, the matches were all quite intense. In Group A, Qingbai lost to Encas 35-47 due to a lack of endurance in the later stages, which was a pity, as Qingbai was leading 22-19 in the first half. In the first match in Group A2B, Yizhong led all the way, leading by two points, 19-17, in the first half, but the result was 43-32, with Yizhong losing to Chunmao. In the second match in Group A1, Renyu overwhelmed the US Military Police due to the disparity in strength, with a one-sided situation. The score in the first half was 39-14, and the result was 72-34, with Renyu winning decisively.

Chunmao Defeats Yizhong

In Group A2B, Chunmao defeated Yizhong 43-33. The score in the first half was 26-14. Both sides had talented players, with He Jingui and Huang Tianlie scoring the most points for Chunmao.

Renyu Defeats US Military Police

In Group A1, Renyu decisively defeated the US Military Police. Wu Xinyun, Yao Wen, Wang Huaiting, and others were considered dangerous players by the opposing team. Mr. of the US Military Police was also agile and a standout player. The score in the first half was 39-14, and the situation was more balanced in the second half, with a score of 33-20, resulting in a final score of 72-34.

Encas Defeats Qingbai

Encas took the stage with authority, scoring two consecutive baskets. The Qingbai players rose up and tied the score at seven each. Zhou Dayun scored two consecutive hollow shots, taking the lead 15-11. Encas called a timeout. At 20-17, Encas's player, Ge Peng, broke his glasses and left the game. The score in the first half was 22-19, with Qingbai leading by three points.

In the second half, Zhao Baokun and Zhang Shaoqing had excellent passes, but Encas's aggressive attacks were formidable and continued to close the gap. When V. Kairos scored a basket, the score was 26-27, with Encas taking the lead by one point. Ma Han added another basket, Shaoqing scored, and Xu Ting made a free throw, tying the score at 30.

### Flourishing Black Market for Gold and US Dollars; Remittance Income Continues to Decrease; No Increase in Remittances After Adjustment of Minimum Foreign Exchange Rate

According to the person in charge of the International Department of the Bank of China, since the new year, remittance income has further decreased. In the past week, the remittances received by the bank were only slightly over 5,100 US dollars and slightly over 320 British pounds, which is even less than at the end of last year. After the Financial Management Bureau twice disrupted the secret mechanisms for trading US dollars in Shanghai's black market, the black market price of US dollars has disappeared. However, the current black market for remittances is now based on the convenience of tax verification in the Guangzhou black market. The black market for gold and US dollars in Guangzhou is still extremely rampant. If the black market for gold and US dollars in Guangzhou can also be hit head-on, then remittances may gradually increase. As for the relationship between remittances and foreign exchange market prices, they have fundamentally decoupled. In the past, each adjustment of the foreign exchange rate could increase remittances slightly, but this time, even with the foreign exchange rate adjusted to 123,500 yuan, there was no increase in remittances. With the black market for foreign exchange still rampant, the future of remittance income is not optimistic.

### Frequent Dumping by Guangdong Merchants Forces Hua Shares Lower

Yesterday, Hua shares were frequently dumped by Guangdong merchants, repeatedly undermining investor confidence. Although there was some upward momentum, they were still forced lower. Trading volume was low, with many short positions, but the cash supply ultimately helped support actual values, so the overall trend was still consolidation. The morning opening was upward, with Yong Yarn opening at 735 yuan and 752 yuan, then rising to highs of 738 yuan and 758 yuan. After much selling, prices fell back to 720 yuan and 739 yuan. Spot interest rates outside the exchange opened at 0.33 yuan and 0.375 yuan, then fell further to lows of 708 yuan and 721 yuan. After 11:00 AM, prices stabilized and began to rise again, reaching highs of 746 yuan and 771 yuan near noon, before closing at 745 yuan and 770 yuan. Compared to the previous close, cash shares of Xinhua, Zhabei, and Beimei rose by 0.5%, Zhongni fell by 0.5%, Shangwu was unchanged, and the rest rose slightly. For forward shares, Qinxing was unchanged, Meiya rose by 10%, and the rest rose slightly.

Although the forward market opened high, starting at 762 yuan and 776 yuan, selling by Guangdong merchant No. 202 immediately pushed prices down. There was significant intervention by the Bank of China, and fears of a cash shortage resurfaced, pushing prices down to 738 yuan and 744 yuan. Although external prices were quoted over 30 yuan higher, and the internal market also rose to 750 yuan and 760 yuan, prices were ultimately forced down to close at 735 yuan and 742 yuan. Compared to the morning close for cash shares, Xinhua, Meiya, and Xinyi fell by 0.5%, Zhongsi fell slightly by 10%, Zhongfang and Zhongni were unchanged, Yongsha, Zhabei, Huaxin, Xinhe, Tongyi, Shangwu, Huafeng, Huoshe, Xinguang, Lianan, Jingfu, Qinxing, Neiyi, and Zhongfa fell slightly, and the rest rose slightly. For forward shares, Xinhe and Jingfu fell by 0.5%, and the rest fell slightly. There were no significant changes in unlisted shares traded outside the exchange.

### Government Bonds Weaken, Foreign Shares Steady

Government bonds weakened yesterday, with only Tong-wu rising slightly, with a turnover of 5 million yuan. Tong-bing opened in the morning at 80,000 yuan, with a low of 77,000 yuan, a high of 82,000 yuan, and then stabilized. Compared to the previous close, Jia-yi fell by 2,000 yuan, Bing-ding was unchanged, and Wu rose by 1,000 yuan. There was some elasticity in yesterday's popular foreign shares, while less popular shares fell. Foreign merchants were selling, and securities and currency dealers were buying. Yi-sha opened in the morning at 520,000 yuan, with a low of 500,000 yuan and a high of around 580,000 yuan, and then fell slightly to close at 550,000 yuan. Compared to the previous close, paper stock rose by 10%, Yeguang rose by 0.5%, Kan-zhi fell by 10%, Yipi and Gangye were unchanged, and the rest had minor changes.

### Rayon Slightly Higher, Silk Market Situation Stable

The rayon market was initially weak but then strengthened, resulting in a slight increase of less than 2 million yuan. No. 120 Xuzi silk opened at only 90 million yuan, with a very balanced supply and demand. By noon, it had risen to 1.5 million yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to strengthen, with the final selling price being 2.5 million yuan. Dongyang and Tianqiao also followed suit.

Yesterday's factory silk market was stable, with trading still sparse. There was only spot trading, with high-quality spot trading around 4 million yuan and mid-quality spot trading around 2 million yuan. Tiger Stove Silk was at 90 million yuan. There were no transactions for all grades of five-lot heads and dry silk, and there was no change in asking prices.

The silk market was stable yesterday, with silk quilt covers rising by 200,000 yuan. Huaqiang goods opened at 1.2 million yuan with transactions, and buying interest was strong, immediately pushing it to 500,000 yuan for the spot price. Then, due to profitable selling, it gradually weakened, closing at 1.2 million yuan for the spot price, and 550,000 yuan to 600,000 yuan for the next-day spot price. Other goods were firm.

### Cotton Merchant Association Meeting Suspended

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Cotton Merchant Association of this city was scheduled to hold a subcommittee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the purchase contract entrusted by the Yarn Control Committee. However, as the contract from the Yarn Control Committee had not yet arrived, the meeting was suspended. Around 4:30 PM, the chairman of the association, Liu Pingsun, was met by Zhu Suwu, deputy director of the Procurement and Transportation Department of the Yarn Control Committee. It is reported that they exchanged views on the drafting of the contract. It is expected that the contract will be sent to the Cotton Merchant Association today for further discussion.

Cotton Collection Statistics

[Reported by Our Newspaper] It is reported that since September of last year, the China Textile Construction Company has collected and stored a total of 652,976 dan of new cotton. The total amount of cotton stored in various regions is 1,009,449 dan.

Indian Cotton Arrives

### Registration of Cotton Yarn Reproduction Industry: Total of 1,000 Manufacturers

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Yarn Control Committee has been rushing to register the reproduction industry in the city for several days. As of yesterday (20th), approximately 6,000 registration forms have been submitted by 11 units, including machine dyeing and weaving, towels and bedsheets, woven belts, handmade cotton weaving, knitting, wool textile, and spinning.

### Prices of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Fall: 4-Count Blue Phoenix Continues to Decline Compared to the Previous Day

Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened weak, with buyers showing little interest and traders offering lower prices. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was briefly seen at 56.8 million yuan. Then, as the cash supply eased slightly, speculators pushed prices up, and reproduction factories saw some buying. By the close of the market, the price had rebounded to 57.8 million yuan, but it was still 700,000 yuan lower than the previous day. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell by 1.2 million to 1.8 million yuan. However, 21-count Double Horse and 20-count Jincheng yarn saw more sales, and their prices rose by 1.2 million yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market initially appeared strong, but then it weakened due to overnight short selling, and prices fell. Around 10:00 AM, Yangzi Company purchased three or four pieces of Yuan Bijie on behalf of its customers, and at the same time, customers from Changjiang also made some purchases, and the market rebounded. Near noon, as the Textile Construction Company opened as usual, traders, believing that the end of the year was approaching and sales were becoming sluggish, showed little interest. Only speculative buying was seen in the market, and prices fell again. By the noon close, most grades of 12-pound fine cloth were flat or weak. Bijie, Zhigong, and bleached cloth were relatively strong. Colored cloth and Shilin cloth remained stable. Other coarse cloth, twill, etc., were uninspired.

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual, selling a total of 4,500 pieces. 106 applications were submitted, with manufacturers purchasing 360 pieces and cloth dealers purchasing the rest.

Raw Cotton Slightly Firmer

Yesterday's raw cotton market was firm amidst weakness. Traders had slightly more cash and showed some buying interest, and investor confidence stabilized. Furthermore, under the principle of unified purchase and distribution of cotton yarn and cloth, cotton merchants still had a way out, so those holding goods were reluctant to sell quickly. At the same time, the purchase price offered by the Textile Construction Company was slightly higher, so the trend was not weak. Today, 495 bales were traded. The factory price for Open Han fine cotton was 5,291,000 yuan, with 234 bales traded. The warehouse price for Open Han fine cotton was 5,167,000 yuan, Lingshi was 5,886,000 yuan and 6,035,000 yuan, with 261 bales traded. Zhoupu seed cotton was 1,135,000 yuan.

### High Asking Prices for Red and Green Tea

Since the stock of red and green tea has decreased, those holding goods are more eager to sell at high prices than in the past, and asking prices have been rising steadily. However, export traders are wary of high prices and are taking a wait-and-see attitude, so the process can only be described as quietly strong. As for domestic tea, since local traders and buyers each have their own sales channels, buyers are continuing to buy strongly regardless of the high prices, and the situation is fierce, with solid footing.

Sugar Market Initially Weak, Then Rebounded: Green and Red Sugar Still Weak

Yesterday's sugar market was initially weak, then rebounded. White sugar rose by varying amounts of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Green and red sugar continued to fall. The association's quoted spot prices were 1,760,000 to 1,720,000 yuan for 24 coarse white, 1,690,000 to 1,712,000 yuan for 4.5 white, 1,660,000 yuan for grass bag, 2,730,000 to 2,690,000 yuan for 20 medium-grain white, 2.1 million yuan for Taiwan red, 1,550,000 to 1,520,000 yuan for No. 1 goods Shantou green, and a small amount of 70,000 yuan, 1,620,000 yuan for Shantou red, 1,670,000 to 1,710,000 yuan for Xinghua white bagged high-grade, up 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, 1,570,000 to 1,600,000 yuan for Xinghua red, a small amount of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, 1,450,000 yuan for Diaoging, a small amount of over 100,000 yuan, 1,550,000 yuan to 1,600,000 yuan for Hainan red, a small amount of 50,000 yuan, 1,500,000 yuan for Xinshunde green. Spot price of the warehouse receipt for 24 coarse white, for tomorrow's delivery, had an fluctuation of 70,000 to 80,000. The afternoon's quoted spot price was at 125,000 yuan, up 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. The four and a half white week four period, summed to 35,000 yuan, had walked up to 110,000-120,000 yuan, later at 85,000 yuan, up 60,000 to 70,000 yuan.

### Grain Department Approves Additional 20,000 Bags of Flour for Re-export Last Month

Northeast Yanging Area Also Approved for Opening

The four flour associations have already allocated the re-export quota for flour in December. The Ministry of Food telegraphed to inform them that the re-export quota has been increased by 20,000 bags, for a total of 420,000 bags.

Because the deadline for shipment is urgent, especially due to the presence of Yin in , the reviewing committee members are scattered in different locations, and it takes time to convene them. To simplify procedures, the quota has been allocated proportionally based on each factory's actual total production in November, which was 1,437,470 bags (the five major factories are not included; their 200,000 bags have been allocated separately). The remaining 8.348% quota is distributed to the 46 factories. Half of the flour destined for Tianjin has already been specially applied for and does not need to be reported again. The remaining flour destined for other regions (excluding Taiwan) must be submitted to the association for transfer to the ministry by January 25. Late submissions will not be accepted.

The ban on re-exports from the Northeast has been lifted, and all factories can now report for re-export.

Lumber Weak

Yesterday's lumber market was weak due to the arrival of foreign pine and the impact of the tight cash supply. All grades of lumber were weak.

### The Four Joint Offices to Adopt Fixed-Order Mortgage Method for Production Loans

(4) The methods for handling fixed-order loans are stipulated as follows: (1) The loan amount will be determined based on the turnover nature and production costs of each industry; (2) The loan term will be determined based on the production process of each industry; (3) When the fixed-order loan matures, the produced finished products will be delivered to repay the loan according to the quantity stipulated in the original contract; (4) The fixed-order price should protect the legitimate interests of each industry; (5) The funds required for fixed-order loans will be advanced by the Central Bank; (6) The materials obtained from the fixed-order loan business should be sold to the government's competent authorities for unified handling; (7) The progress of work, expenditure costs, raw materials, quality, and manufacturing technology of each industry receiving fixed-order loans should be reviewed at any time, and personnel may be dispatched to audit them at any time. (8) The format of this loan contract and implementation rules will be formulated separately. (9) For production businesses that have been approved to handle fixed-order loans, if they need funds for transportation and sales, various banks and bureaus may provide loan assistance in coordination with the mortgage method, but they must not lend funds in the form of other pledges and discounts. It is said that these guidelines have been approved and implemented by the board of directors of the Four Joint Offices' headquarters.

Yesterday, the total amount of rice arriving in the northern and southern markets was more than 20,300 stones, the source of supply was abundant, the shops were relaxed, the market sales were stagnant, and prices continued to decline.

Baiyuan and Yinyuan still raised prices to kill the low prices severely.

Flour was slightly uneven, and the factory's inventory was not much, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brands and inland customer flour arrived in Shanghai continuously, with no fluctuations for the time being. Bran sales in rural areas turned stagnant, re-entering a state of fatigue, falling by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan, forming a fleeting situation.

Yellow beans sales were stagnant and wooden, continuing to fall by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Green beans were not much digested in the north, and were sluggish.

Red sorghum sales were idle, reduced by more than 10,000 yuan. Corn in Beiyang was lax in digestion, falling sharply by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.

### Regulations on Surcharges for Dyes Arriving Without Permits

The Review Committee for Handling Goods Arriving at the Port with Self-Prepared Foreign Exchange Without Permits held its 18th meeting at the China Trust Bureau on the afternoon of the 20th to discuss the issue of how to add surcharges to the cost of dyes for allocation and sale.

(3) Sulfurized yuan is divided into three types, namely 20%, 200%, and 500%.

It is also learned that this Thursday's meeting will be suspended, and this Saturday's meeting will discuss the surcharge for Western medicine and chemical raw materials.

### Cigarettes and Candles are Both Tired

Yesterday's cigarette market conditions, at the beginning of the transaction, were idle, and then the actual sales were still good, and the peers made up a lot, and the market saw the rise. Unexpectedly, near the close, the Yizhong Company opened the Dapunan, Weisan, and Pao Tai Qianmen cigarettes, and the peers' positions were tight again, and they sold a lot at high prices, and the price became tired again. As a result, except for Samsung Quanlu, which saw a slight increase due to absorbing at low prices, ten British old knives continued to fall by 100,000 to 50,000 yuan, and other Chinese and foreign cigarettes all declined.

The daily necessities soap market, because Huang Xiangmao will handle the distribution of goods, the allocation price per box is 1.1 million yuan, buyers are inferior, as a result, Guben soap returned by a small 5,000 yuan, Arrow Knife fell by 10,000 yuan, Xiangmao alone fell by 20,000 yuan, Niu Pai Meili and other soaps rose by 10,000, and match sales were weak, falling by about ten.

The kerosene market atmosphere is still strong, and the peers mutually made high-degree barrel goods 7.23 million yuan, Mobil cans 840,000 yuan, and foreign candles stood firm.

### Export Industry Improves After Foreign Exchange Increase

Since the foreign exchange rate increased by 27%, the export industry has improved. Recently, the most exports have been furs, and various European countries have been in great need of furs these days, and it is also the peak season for fur sales, so sales have increased. Other items such as tung oil, bristles, tea, and eggs still have large differences in domestic and foreign prices, so although there are sales, the export figures are not many. As for export mortgage financing, the Bank of China and other banks have not stopped at the same time due to the suspension of loans from national banks and bureaus. At present, exporters can still ask to do mortgage financing to use as working capital. However, this mortgage financing is limited to 30 days, and it must be returned within the time limit.

### Firewood Arrives Rarely and Prices are Expensive

It is now midwinter, the weather is severe, the price of coal has risen due to insufficient sources, and firewood has also become rare due to shipments from Wenzhou and other places. The street shops are very eager to digest it, and the supply of spot goods cannot meet the demand, and the market is surprisingly good. Chestnut firewood was 135,000 yuan per load last week, and yesterday's asking price rose to 145,000 yuan. Miscellaneous firewood was 123,000, pine firewood was 112,000, and dry firewood was sold for 150,000, an increase of more than 10%.

Literature

### Random Notes by Zhimo (1)

— Posthumous Works of Xu Zhimo, Edited by Chen Congzhou

These random notes by Zhimo are works by the poet Xu Zhimo during his studies in the New World and England. They are all written casually, as records; some are similar to diaries, some are similar to essays, written in a very scattered manner, requiring much sorting. Ms. Shan instructed me to compile them, and now I have arranged them and tentatively named them "Random Notes by Zhimo". From these scattered fragments, one can vaguely imagine Xu's spirit and demeanor in those years, evoking endless memories for the reader. Recorded by Chen Congzhou on January 15th, 37th year.

From October 15th, the four of us living together will abide by the agreed rules, such as getting up at six o'clock, morning meeting at seven o'clock (inspiring shame and motivation), singing the national anthem in the evening, and going to bed at half past ten. During the day, in addition to encouraging study, we exercise, take walks, and read newspapers.

Ambitious but lazy; going to bed around eleven o'clock, getting up at six o'clock, afraid of the cold, mouth feels greasy, must wash before feeling refreshed, often feel sluggish after meals and want to sleep, especially in the warm library, which makes laziness escape and sleep demons invade; but I enjoy reading at night the most, which is the result of twenty years of habit. Lifelong illness is laziness. My mother never stopped thinking it was terrible, and I almost lived my entire life lazy. From now on, I will cheer up and make killing laziness my top priority.

Because of laziness, I am scattered and call it unconventional. My parents are both diligent and able to encourage, why is their son so scattered? Could it be the legacy of Teacher Cha Tongsun! Zhimo thinks he has a lot of blood, but he made friends with the wrong people when he was young, so he never heard any stimulating words; growing up in society, he developed a bad view and bad habits, and was so scattered and undisciplined. From now on, I will start everything in order, in a proper manner, and it will be difficult to be chaotic again.

Poor Zhimo has lost his spirituality for more than twenty years! Heaven cannot bear for Zhimo to end his life in such a broad way. Fortunately, he was able to travel north and his wings were refined. Looking down at the lower realm, he realized that what he had seen before was so ugly, vulgar, narrow, and filthy, how could he be like that! Looking back at myself, I am still a member of the black, ugly, vulgar, narrow, and filthy group. All of its characteristics have not been missing. Usually in the abalone shop, so used to the stink, now suddenly came to the iris world, began to feel ashamed (because human nature is good) ugly, and then its vulgarity, wash its filth, morning and evening, carefully, and still feel not up to know it, and the line has not followed; stand, but can not before also. Even if here can go before also, and difficult to protect the day after the investment in the society that has been from, although there is a peeling wash of the heart, and material desires rot outside, the roots (evil roots) sudden in the , its not lose yuan Chang who few hope! Hope grinding peeling wash of the power also? Mo to this war curse thought, wearing hair shares cannot be themselves also.

The other day, the English sharpness of thought , almost there has been no birth to also, whether in the past muddy society never think of this, that is, since the sea, until more than ten days ago, its pre-plug congestion, never seen the light of day also, please say the thought of today.

Mr. Liang's biography of the three Italian heroes, and Zhimo's blood courage began to appear. The actions of the three heroes are indeed extremely grand and delightful, and Mr. Liang's writing is also naturally strong and like a dragon soaring in the air, with the power to pull mountains and cover the world, dripping and painful, it is not only Zhimo who is low and generous, all the people in the world with blood are unable to stop the excitement! In the past, it was thought that heroes were born from heaven and could not be hoped for; now it is thought that the reason why heroes are different from others is that they can hold on to a breath of energy, quickly and directly without obstruction also. Confucius said: "I want benevolence, and benevolence is here!" As for self-deprecating their ambition to confine Ziyong and the ordinary, it is their self-seeking for the ordinary. And can not be obtained ear, Moreover in the extraordinary. To make Zhimo can hold the three masters of the meaning and spirit, and fast and straight forward also: then Mazzini Zhimo also, Garibaldi Zhimo also, Cavour Zhimo also. Only its potential has external pressure and the air has a middle decline, then nine of the power or loss of one . Ancient admiration event, Huai their three masters of the intention and spirit who, do not know its several thousands also! They who do not become, the air is weak and the intention is taken away

Zhimo is new in spirit, Huanhuan is like a tiger coming out of a fence, thinking that the world's affairs are not enough to be governed. Although this is floating air, please follow its origin, Zhimo thought that the ability of the ancient heroes and sages to achieve their careers must be based on something. What is it based on? Talent, learning, luck, are all its branches and not the main trunk. What is the main trunk? Only sincerity. The ability of heaven to transform, the ability of earth to create, nothing else, is only sincerity. Husband sincere then a few do God's movement of gold and stone wear yan; Therefore body then can become, Zhimo not please to its sincerity. Sincerity is the foundation. The foundation is established and the Tao is born, if the foundation is not established, then its its knowledge are like Lu Zi said by borrowing Kou soldiers steal food also. Therefore Yu Yu this Canghai flow of the day and revealed to the good knowledge, to be the first of all things. The world has gentleman, its Yu Liang also? (To be continued)

### On the Technique of Fiction

— Yi

Psychological Description

Psychological description is one of the reasons why the author "shows his face" in the story, and psychological description is indispensable except for extremely simple stories.

Novels are mainly about narrating plots and describing characters. But it's not enough, the reader also needs to know what the characters in the book are thinking, how they react to their encounters, whether there are contradictions in their hearts, and what the motives for their words and deeds are. Writing down this process of thought one by one is called psychological description in the novel. The two words "psychological" are slightly different from what scientists call psychology. Psychological description in novels refers to subjective experience.

Describing psychological experiences has been popular since the mid-nineteenth century, and it was still the case with Henry James. Both Joyce and Virginia Woolf placed more emphasis on psychological description than James, sometimes even neglecting the layout. But there are several methods of psychological description that James did not use, and the Joyce school rarely used them, psychological analysis being one of them.

Psychological analysts are novelists who explain the motives of characters' behavior, especially when the motives are not very obvious. This method did not begin in the nineteenth century, it already existed in the eighteenth century, and Fielding was one of them. He treated the novel as a philosophical essay, writing about people's feelings and moods, without "dramatization" at all, but only discussing them satirically. He used a "generalized" method to discuss the psychology of characters in order to suit his moral standards. This philosophical argument can be said to be Fielding's specialty.

The novels of George Meredith all contain philosophical meaning. Psychological analysis often hinders the progress of the story, and is very unnatural, even more annoying than Fielding. Fielding sometimes simply and clearly narrates the action, while Eliot often discusses the depths of consciousness beyond the superficial motives, which is very close to Freud's theory of the subconscious, Meredith and Butler both have this tendency. Butler's argument is inevitably filled with the atmosphere of the eighteenth century, dry and tasteless. Originally, Victorian novels mostly emphasized both reason and emotion. Eliot's psychological description is sometimes not very wrong, but what is annoying is that she herself wants to go on stage to "show her face" and comment on the characters. She is like a teacher to the readers, lecturing and pointing, teaching there, ; and to the characters, she is like a "hen protecting her chicks", just afraid that they will make mistakes.

Meredith's psychological description is slightly different from Eliot's. Eliot is good at writing selfish and self-interested hearts, while Meredith's writing is more complex, is a moral and glorious heart. Meredith's is more than Fielding and Eliot, is very distinctive, and is sometimes close to dramatization, but the meaning, the tone of teaching, is even more obvious than them. At this point, the novel is not much different from historical philosophy, like doing , analyzing the characters' feelings, and establishing his philosophy of human nature. Strictly speaking, Meredith is simply not a novelist. The so-called novelist has a certain range, and a talent like Xiang Meredith has not been excluded from the novelists, and it cannot be said that it is useless to read his novels, but technique is another matter, only that he has too much abstract gossip and too little concrete description, not giving us room for imagination. His characters never had a chance to interrupt. In addition, there is a big problem is miscellaneous. Why do you say he is miscellaneous? For example, analyzing psychology, writing is indeed a bit dramatized, but he is letting the characters in the book perform themselves, and he also interjected to say a few words, which makes it very disharmonious, disharmonious is also, he himself often slaps himself in the mouth, the reason why he is slightly better than Eliot is because the writing is still dramatized.

French writers are also good at analyzing emotions, such as Marcel Proust. Proust's Remembrance of Things Past (Ala Recherche du temps perdu) is a masterpiece, because it is not a novel, so it may be a wild horse, talking about this and that, and it does not look as unpleasant as Meredith's work. There is also a difference between French writers and English writers. French writers mostly hold a fatalistic view, while English writers hold a free will theory. Words of teaching are everywhere. This is also where Proust has a slight advantage.

### Novel Quotes

— Wang Yang

When a novelist encounters a situation where he doesn't know how to describe the characters in his work, the best way is to assume himself to be the character in the work and imagine his way out. — Blake

The novelist has created the "psychological destiny" of mankind, while reportage cannot but expose, sort out, and grasp the destiny that heavily covers mankind. — Malraux

### A Little Knowledge of Storytelling

— Dai Bufan

The story of Shuang Jian and Su Qing

The story of Shuang Jian and Su Qing, in the Song dynasty, was as popular as Zhang story, and the story was often cited in operas and novels. I don't know, but the story has been around for a long time, and I have lost the plot. Recently, Zhao Jingshen has "lost the little girl" from many books, so I can know a little bit about her true face. Zhao See "New Examination of Novels and Operas" two two three-three zero eight) But Zhao seems to have missed a little ready-made information, that is also in "Stone ":" - Volume II "Mengxian Xunqiang Jiang". In "Mengxian Jiang Xunqiang", although there is a "such as Feng Shang still concubine story", Mengxian Its The actual experience is somewhat similar to Su Qing marrying Feng Sheng and Su Qing going to find . And is she married a Jiangxi merchant (salt merchant). Su Qing also married a Jiangxi merchant (tea merchant). As for the poems inscribed by Su Qing and Huizhen in Jinshan Temple, there are only a few . Now compare their differences as follows: (The poem is recorded from Zhao's book, and the ones in parentheses are from "Shi Dian Tou".)

"Remembering the past (since) when breaking the phoenix, so far the news is both vast, not to make a Jin wife in the coffin, into the ground should look for (still from) folding laurel lang. Peng Yanmeng (return), night rain breaking the intestine. New poetry writing (to) Jinshan Temple, hanging high the cloud sail on (over) Yuzhang."

This is certainly not a coincidence. In the fiftieth chapter of Water Margin, Bai Xiuying said the story: "Lu Chengjian chased Su Qing", perhaps the author of "Stone", Tian Ran Chi, had seen this story and gave it a new name, changing to to think it was already made.

### Random Notes on a Winter Morning

— Chen Luming

Through my eyelids, the sky is dimly bright.

The shadows of yesterday's displeasure clinging to my heart disappear in the black stream of night. New hopes, radiant with smiles, step into the dawn and fall on the still silent earth.

The sun begins to bring precious warmth to winter. In the clear and bright sky, a white cloud slowly drifts, like a nun draped in a white veil, silently praying to the morning light in the purity of the clouds. Poets often like to entrust strange beauty to the sunset in beautiful poems. If we compare the sky at sunset to a bustling dance hall playing intoxicating jazz music, then let me describe the long sky in the morning light as a solemn and luminous sanctuary. In front of the cross, it makes the sinner reflect and repent, and the fierce ambitious person slowly lower his head, and from the depths of his conscience, he begins to praise peace and harmony. However, there is no hypocritical preacher here, only the ancient bronze bell in the spire, making a minute's respite, filling people's empty hearts with sound.

Birds are the most lively singers in the morning. Even in such a closed winter, their trembling, crisp, and transgressive voices bring back spring and childhood dreamscapes from the creek to people's hearts. Looking at such a small singer, and looking at the clumsy, bare mountains in this mountainous country, I laughed very comically.

On the withered grass, there are delicate dewdrops that have secretly condensed last night. Like playful children, they soak into people's soles, or, by the terrain, fill the stomachs of the trousers' fibers. The bold ones stand on the tops of the thatch flowers, making dazzling smiles at the morning sun. The sunlight turns them into small, frighteningly visible substances and brings them to the high sky, so the air is mixed with a healthy aroma of soil. Those who can work in this breath for a long time are just hard-working farmers who work hard all year round to nourish others. Let us bless these elemental lives. If they are safe and happy, then the entire human society will be blessed.

How careful should we be about the farewell of love and hate!

After being washed by the morning wilderness, a person's thoughts will be completely purified. Let our hearts open to nature and sing.

### Recent World Literary Scene

— Zhao Jingshen

Gide's Diary

Andre Gide of France won the Nobel Prize for Literature at the end of last year, and now his early diary has been published in English translation, which can be said to be a gratifying event in the literary world.

Gide began writing a diary at the age of twenty; the complete French text is one thousand three hundred . The first volume of the American edition was translated by Albring (J. O'Brien), from the time Gide began his literary work until the edge of the First World War, so there is little narration about that war.

The characters narrated in this volume include almost all the great writers in Europe, such as Dandan , Maeterlinck, Wilde, Rodin, Degas, etc. The background ranges from Paris to St Germain, Rome, Tunis and Seville. Albring said in the preface that Gide's early diary mainly talked about himself, he was loyal to his own examination and dreams, philosophical contemplation and the endlessness of emotions.

The date of this diary is from 1889 to 1906. The part from 1901 to 1906 is the most interesting, and his own examination and philosophical contemplation are all expressed in this period. Gide wrote in 1904: "Since I finished "The Immoralist" (L Immoralite) on October 25, 1901, I have not been able to work solemnly." During this silent period, the diary was filled with (terrible insomnia), the continued struggle to prevent "the disintegration of thought".

A year later, Gide wrote in his country house: "Can't I calm my terrible throbbing heart? I run in the desert like a madman." The Catholic education Gide received in his youth was indeed a factor in his adult crisis. He also said: "Lord, let this too narrow ethics explode..." The path he chose was not to be honored, solemn literary work. "Around me, I am the one who creates silence." Although Gide is a moral person, he also openly admits his own sexual impulses. He believes on the one hand that he is very holy, and on the other hand he says that he is very corrupt.

In short, it is this struggle of emotions, this trauma, this terrible throbbing of the heart, that makes Gide an artist, that makes him escape the vanity of Stendhal or the irritability of Flaubert, and that he is not as lacking in psychological description as Aragon or Sartre. He is the only one among French modern writers who belongs to the Proust school.

This early diary also describes his personal life, such as the fact that he received religious forced education, he was raised by his mother and aunts, he has two houses in Normandy, he has a garden, he plays the organ, and even such trivial things as having lunch at home are written inside.

### The New Poet Laurie Lee

During the Great War, England produced many small publications, especially in Australia, where Cyril Connolly's "Horizon" and Lehman's "Penguin New Writing" were the most famous. Laurie Lee published poems in these two publications, and at least two other poetry anthologies used his work. "The Sun My Monument" was his first collection of poems.

He writes well about both the countryside and war. His poems are simple and easy to understand, because the British people during the war were impatient with poets' imaginations.

He is worthy of being called a romantic, with a touch of sentimentality. In addition to singing pastoral tunes and lamenting ruins, he also writes love poems.

He also often uses metaphors, which although very common in poetry, are often easily written in a messy way, but he is able to connect different things in a very harmonious way.

If Laurie Lee had been born in an earlier era, he might as well have been just a happy pastoral poet, writing some fantasy poems. However, he lives in this modern world of struggle, so he is also constantly aware of the pulse of the times, and he fully sees the disharmony of the world, and wants to seek a solution.

### Yellowed Leaves

— Jingwen

I happened to see in a certain newspaper a reprint of an article from the Soviet "Literary Gazette" entitled "Leaves Turn Yellow When They Leave the Tree." The title itself is poetic, and since it was published in the "Literary Gazette," it must be a poem or literary work. But after careful reading, it turned out to be a pure political propaganda article, criticizing French General de Gaulle, saying that General de Gaulle had left the people, just like leaves leaving the tree, and became yellowed.

I don't want to talk about de Gaulle here, because I have never been interested in figures on the political stage. People who have read some history probably have the same feeling, that no matter how turbulent and invincible a person is, from a historical perspective, he is just a fallen leaf in the forest. The world is constantly changing, and everything is like passing clouds. Who can escape the fate of being a fallen leaf under the ruthless wheels of history—or rather, time—regarding things and people that are considered great today?

My interest lies in the title "Leaves Turn Yellow When They Leave the Tree." This and the saying "Things must rot before worms grow in them" have the same subtle effect. It is most difficult to use metaphors when writing articles or speaking, because the function of metaphors is to express a complex idea in the most concise, easy-to-understand, and suggestive language. A good metaphor must have the basic conditions of common sense, that is, popularity. Although popular common sense is not necessarily the truth—and in many cases, it is the opposite of the truth—because it is common sense, it is easy for people to understand and accept.

For example, sayings like "Leaves Turn Yellow When They Leave the Tree" or "Things Must Rot Before Worms Grow in Them" are not necessarily the truth if you are strict about it. Because although leaves will turn yellow when they leave the tree, and things will inevitably breed worms after they rot, more accurately, it is really because the leaves have yellowed or are about to yellow that they leave the tree, and things will rot after they breed worms. However, in terms of common sense, everyone doesn't care about this, because the meaning is always clear anyway.

But the terrible thing about common sense is precisely in this place. You might as well say that common sense is the accumulation of life experiences, but you can also say that common sense is an obstacle to the progress of human intelligence. Because although many common sense ideas contain some truth, most of what is called common sense is just a soporific that leads people to go down the path of not seeking thorough understanding. There are many so-called "Common Sense Guides" and "Common Sense Q&A" and other books and publications on the market, most of which are this kind of thing.

There is a so-called "nerve warfare" tactic in modern international relations. Propaganda expressed in words or pictures is a type of "nerve warfare." Moreover, it is said that propaganda also has techniques, the main point of which is that it should be popular and easy to understand, so that people can easily be impressed. Being able to impress people is called achieving an effect in propaganda "terminology." Therefore, people who deeply understand propaganda techniques should not only have a wealth of common sense themselves, but also understand how to use other people's common sense concepts. Because theories and doctrines cannot be fully understood by everyone, but common sense can achieve the effect of being taken for granted by everyone.

The article in the "Literary Gazette," if it only spoke about how General de Gaulle was wrong in the front, no matter how clear and reasonable it was, it would not leave any impression on people who were not involved. But now, by lightly using the nine characters "Leaves Turn Yellow When They Leave the Tree," not only does the title itself have considerable appeal, but in terms of "propaganda effect," it is undoubtedly better than a long political theory. Because for people who don't seek thorough understanding, just reading such a title will leave some impression.

However, I have to say that being able to make good use of people's common sense concepts can achieve the purpose of propaganda techniques, but this is also limited to a part of people who regard common sense as truth. For promoting truth and enlightening human intelligence, this method is not advisable, because the common sense concepts it uses are really just using human weaknesses. After a long time, the propaganda technique itself will inevitably wither like a leaf. At that time, people's logic will no longer be "Leaves Turn Yellow When They Leave the Tree," but the yellowed leaves must leave the tree.

### The Cat's Home

— Leihong

Sam Goldwyn needed one hundred and fifty cats for a scene in a film. The film's props person received this urgent notice and had no choice, so he thought of the city's animal sanctuary.

Luckily, the owner of the animal sanctuary had just collected a large number of cats that people didn't want and had abandoned. So he handed over one hundred and fifty cats.

The props person asked the company authorities to reimburse the costs, at $2.50 per cat per day. But one day the company had finished filming the scene and no longer needed the cats. No one was going to take in so many little animals. The owner of the animal sanctuary took them back, and the props person came up with a great plan to clear out the kittens.

The next day, an advertisement appeared in the newspaper. It said that the owner of the animal sanctuary had a batch of cats that had "appeared on the silver screen," and the price was only one dollar each.

Every kitten in the animal sanctuary found a new home in one day.

### Reynolds' Feat

— Heku

Since the end of World War II, the United States has produced at least one extraordinary person, and that person is Reynolds. Reynolds' ballpoint pen, with its appeal as a pen that doesn't use ink, shocked novelty-loving Americans, thus allowing Reynolds to start his business with ballpoint pens.

But the ballpoint pen was not Reynolds' invention. He obtained the manufacturing rights from foreigners, and overturned the ballpoint pens of other pen companies such as Sheaffer, fought lawsuits, and finally promoted this type of pen to the American market. Although there are several brands of ballpoint pens sold on the American market now, the Reynolds Pen Company's ballpoint pens are of course the oldest brand. Not only do Americans have one in their hands, but this type of pen can also be seen in various countries in Europe and Asia.

In fact, ballpoint pens are novel in their construction, but in practical terms, they may not necessarily be able to defeat fountain pens, which have a history of more than a hundred years. People who have used them have this experience, and the reason does not need to be explained. It is obvious after a comparison. Therefore, there is still room for improvement. This is a point that the Reynolds Company must consider in order to defeat the current best-selling fountain pens.

Therefore, Reynolds does not hesitate to spend huge sums of money to promote his own ballpoint pens. He hired pilots to fly his own "Reynolds Bomber" on a round-the-world flight, in order to break the world record for round-the-world flights. The so-called round-the-world flight is to tour around the cities that sell his Reynolds pens, in order to achieve publicity. He came to our country twice last year, and the "Reynolds Bomber" became eye-catching news in our country's newspapers.

Now he is coming to Shanghai again. This time it is not a round-the-world flight, but to explore China, measure high mountains and great rivers, and use another method to promote Reynolds pens. His ingenuity in advertising and the huge expenses involved are truly astonishing.

But I admit that Reynolds' advertising skills are more successful than his Reynolds pens! His advertising has positive significance, such as the round-the-world flight breaking the world record, and the exploration flight delving into the wilderness. These are all large-scale actions, and publicity is only one of the goals. Creating his magnificent plan and making Reynolds' name world-famous, indirectly making the new pens sell well, is his ultimate goal. He uses the task of special contribution, which is disdained by today's great men who are arguing and engulfed in war all over the world. Reynolds is willing to use the surplus of his business to complete it, which is worth paying attention to.

Our country is not without public-spirited entrepreneurs who "take from society and give back to society," but these are few and far between. Compared with Reynolds' feats, there is an enormous difference. Most of the bosses who make huge profits in business do nothing but extreme extravagance and embellish their personal enjoyment. Compared with Reynolds, their virtue and lack thereof are vastly different.

### Brands of American Goods

— Daoxian

People who buy things like to pay attention to brands, and people who make things don't hesitate to spend huge advertising fees to create brands, in order to give buyers a deep impression.

The brand of goods, which is also called a trademark, always follows two major principles: first, it is easy to pronounce; second, it is simple and easy to remember. Some people like to come up with awkward and strange names, but the choice of a trademark never takes this inferior approach.

Many well-known brands are not very clear about their stories.

For example, let's talk about cigarettes. The first one to be sold in China after the victory was "Marlboro." It is not "Marx," of course, there is a reason for this. It turns out that there was a tobacco merchant named Philip Morris, who made his own cigarettes in 1847 and sold them to customers at Oxford University. Soon, he opened a branch near Cambridge University. One was Morris Oxford, and the other was Morris Cambridge. Later, it was bought by Americans, and they did not like dragging an Oxford or Cambridge tail, so they simply called it Philip Morris.

There is also a type of mint cigarette called Spud, which is also a person's name. This person has always rolled his own cigarettes. Once he felt a little unwell, the doctor told him to eat some menthol. He put a little in the tobacco leaves and found the taste very good, so he made and sold it himself. Later, he sold all the trademarks to other tobacco companies.

The name Camel was chosen because it is easy to pronounce. As for that camel picture, it is a camel from a certain circus called "Old Easy."

For facial soap, there is a type of palm soap related to the Egyptian beauty Cleopatra. Because it is said that this queen used palm oil to wash her face every day to make her skin beautiful. The company publicized this anecdote greatly, and palm soap became famous all over the world.

The original name of Norge refrigerators was "Extremely Cold Refrigerators." The company's boss wanted to change to a new trademark in 1926, and as a result, they adopted this Norwegian word. It simultaneously contains the meanings of north and cold, which is quite suitable for a refrigerator trademark. But because the company executives deeply liked this trademark name, they later used this brand for the stoves they produced.

The brands of American cars generally come from two sources: one is taken from historical figures, such as Lincoln and Cadillac (a French nobleman who later went to the New World and founded Detroit), etc. The other is taken from famous people in the automobile manufacturing industry, such as Ford, Buick, Studebaker, and Chrysler, etc.

### Heavy American Taxes

—

The current rise in the cost of living in the United States and the huge government spending are also major reasons. The total amount of taxes paid by the American people in one year now reaches 50 billion US dollars. Although this includes state and local taxes, the federal government collects more than 40 billion yuan.

According to estimates by a certain agency of the federal government, the food consumed by Americans in 1946 was worth about 39 billion yuan.

Compared in this way, the huge government spending in the United States is even more apparent. The management fees paid by the American people to the government are more than the money they spend on food.

In total, one-third to one-quarter of the American people's annual income flows into the dead end of taxes. Truman's proposed budget for this year is four times higher than the highest budget in peacetime.

A small loaf of bread has already paid several taxes by the time it is sold on the market. Farmers who grow wheat have to pay taxes, middlemen who sell wheat on behalf of farmers have to pay taxes, millers who grind wheat into flour have to pay taxes, bakers who bake bread have to pay taxes, and grocers who sell bread have to pay taxes. The money that a housewife takes out to buy bread is also the surplus after deducting income tax.

### Writing a Book Is Difficult

— Jinjin

Recently, I was honored to have a certain bookstore not abandon me and asked me to write a book about an introduction to economics, etc. It has been completed and is in the process of being typeset. Therefore, I have read a lot of books on economics, currency, banking, and the history of economics. I happened to read a passage in a monograph written by a predecessor in economics (I will not mention the great name and title of this gentleman, because he is still the scholar I admire most so far) when describing the origin of currency, which said: "In ancient Greece, cattle were used as currency. Chapter 23 of Homer's Iliad states that in a certain martial arts competition, the winner received a three-legged iron frame worth twelve head of cattle. The loser received a woman whose value was four head of cattle." At that time, I felt very strange. It is reasonable for the winner to receive a prize. But the loser can get a woman, which from a subconscious point of view, is somewhat of a good prize and seems quite incomprehensible.

Some time later, I also read a passage on page 21 of the 1940 edition of Money and Banking written by Professor Eujeniaglag of Rutgers University in the United States, which referred to the same fact. The original text when translated into Chinese is like this:

"Diomedes' arm was worth nine cattle, and Glaucus' arm was worth one hundred cattle. In the twenty-third poem of the Iliad, the first prize awarded to the wrestlers, a tripod, was worth twelve cattle, and a female captive was worth four head of cattle. Although slaves were also calculated in cattle, it was a (transaction) unit with a higher value than cattle."

The original text of this section has clear punctuation and does not list female captives as a type of prize, and never mentioned that it was a reward obtained by the loser. The doubts I had before disappeared.

Therefore, I deeply feel the difficulty of writing a book. With a pen in hand, I can't help but be cautious. Occasional errors in writing can be forgiven, but if the cattle head doesn't match the horse's mouth, wouldn't it be a laughingstock? What's more, new theories are emerging one after another. Yesterday's insights may have room for discussion today. For example, when I read the quantity theory of money, which roughly means that the value of currency is governed by the quantity of currency (including checking account balances), the rate of circulation, and the quantity of supply and demand of goods, I felt very interested and thought it made sense. However, I then read the criticism of Laughlin and others, who believed that gold and silver coins had their own value and had nothing to do with the amount in circulation. Modern scholars also believe that government spending, tax rates, wage increases and decreases, and psychological support have a greater impact on the value of currency, far above the amount of currency in circulation. I suddenly felt that writing black characters on white paper to create an eternal theory is really difficult.

### Legendary Figures

— Jimo

In some convoluted or Hollywood movies, we can often see some legendary figures who either have unique skills or act extraordinarily. They either take on secret tasks, are born to die, or are bold and careful, and are not cowardly in the face of adversity, and are finally able to turn danger into safety. They are not only heroes in our minds, but also when we watch the development of the story and see them show off their skills and accomplish great things, we can't help but raise a glass to them. A friend of mine collectively calls these characters "Tough Guys," which is not without feeling.

However, when the author comes into contact with these "legendary" figures in real life, there seems to be very little of the exaggerated atmosphere in novels. A relative of mine once worked as an underground intelligence officer during the enemy and puppet period. Once, he was discovered by the Japanese army. My relative ran out of the back door in short clothes and barely escaped. His colleagues, unfortunately, were all executed by the Japanese army. My relative was still frightened after the pain, and although he was known for his alertness, he was a heart patient. He was able to remain calm in times of crisis, but his heart would beat faster when he heard a car horn while crossing the road!

There is also someone named Yi, who once fought as a guerrilla behind the Japanese army during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and was able to fire guns with both hands, hitting the target nine times out of ten. He had been in direct contact with the Japanese army on the front line and had personally killed many Japanese soldiers. After retiring from the army after the war, he resumed the life of a farmer. Looking at his dark skin and shy demeanor, wearing a blue cloth gown, who would know that his actions could be compared with those of "heroes"?

### Prohibition

— Pinggong

According to a Central News Agency report from Penghu on the 18th, the people of Penghu are addicted to alcohol, and fishermen who die in the belly of fish due to drunkenness are often heard of. The county government has therefore decided to enforce prohibition on Tuesdays and Fridays, and drinking on other days is also limited from 5:00 pm to 10:00 pm. It is said that after implementation, more than 5 million yuan (Taiwan dollars) in alcohol expenses can be saved every day.

Although I am not a fisherman from Penghu, I also have a strong tendency to be addicted to alcohol. When Drinkwater wrote the script for "Lincoln," he wrote that Mrs. Lincoln hated others smoking, and would reprimand anyone who violated the rule. At that time, I secretly thought that Mrs. Lincoln was too unforgiving; but observing the recent situation, I saw that Puritans at home and abroad had changed direction and were once again embarking on the road to prohibition. The drunkards shown in the film "Lost Weekend" are known to drinking comrades to be completely exaggerated (and the Chinese have never drunk so messily), and people who do not drink naturally cannot be blamed for being shocked and regarding them as demons. Today, reading the Penghu County Government's ban gives me a sense of resonance—and it is equally comical.

I say that alcohol must never be "prohibited." Why? Because after it is "prohibited," your "addiction" will become deeper and deeper, and it will be uncontrollable. Every good drinker has had such an experience: the more others forbid you to drink, the more you want to drink. Conversely, if your capacity is only half a liter, and others give you one and a half liters at every meal, you will happily drink half a liter at the first meal, but your tongue will be numb and your heart will be upset (and if the wine is bad, you will also have a headache and dizziness). At the second meal, even if you force yourself to drink it, you will "eat but not know its taste." By tomorrow, you will have to rest a little, and at most drink a quarter of a liter at each meal. But if you can drink half a liter, and the imperial decree only allows you to drink a quarter of a liter, then the severity of this "thirst for alcohol" is simply unbearable. Going to knock on the door of a hotel in the snowy winter night is at this time. This reason is similar to "It is better to bury a monk alive than to starve him."

Therefore, if I were a fisherman from Penghu, then after the Penghu County Government's prohibition measure is implemented, the time when I would most want to drink would definitely be Tuesday and Friday, and if there is an "opportunity" to drink, I would definitely drink more than usual. I remember that during the period when Shanghai was occupied, the enemy and puppet authorities also prohibited drinking at noon. As a result, everyone used teapots and teacups to hold wine in restaurants. With this disguise, everyone felt at ease—and the point that I remember most deeply so far is that I drank more wine than usual at that time, and in fact, the taste of the wine was often not good, because it was already giving you face for the restaurant to let you drink, and you really couldn't be too picky.

Therefore, after the prohibition order is issued, there will inevitably be many who drink secretly. Because it is "secret" drinking, they drink hastily, carelessly, and casually, and therefore lose their health. It should be known that among ten people who drink alcohol, there are always one or two who still understand a little about the fun of drinking. But after a prohibition order is issued, ten drinkers are ten drunkards, and drinking at that time will really become dysentery.

Chapter Eight: Success Within Reach (48)

Yunqing said, "It's good even if he can't agree, from now on, he's not allowed to have any more ulterior motives!" Fengsheng sighed, "What you're saying is all correct, you can control people, but you can't control hearts. I knew long ago that Zhuzhai had ulterior motives, I just didn't expect him to change so quickly! I think this condition is worth putting forward, as for the vulgar urging me to find someone else, urging me to remarry, that will never happen in this lifetime." As she spoke, she shed tears again. Yunqing saw this and felt somewhat sad inside. But then she thought, this is an opportunity, I can't let it go because of a little bit of compassion, and give up on doing it. Furthermore, suggesting this idea to her is very flexible and controllable. If things go smoothly, I won't let anyone take the benefits. If there are any setbacks, Fengsheng's rights still exist. Since Zhuzhai's intentions have already changed, I can't ruin him to comfort his emotions. Even if I ruin him, I might not succeed and it would only add to the disputes. Not being able to comfort Zhuzhai would only add to Fengsheng's suffering, so what good would it do? In that instant, Yunqing's mind raced, and she made up her mind, saying, "This is where your inherent kindness and affection lie, I'm afraid Zhuzhai can't be as sincere as you are, right?" Fengsheng said, "Of course he has no affection for me, if he did, he wouldn't have taken such actions. One wrong step leads to a hundred wrong steps, it was my mother who married me to him for the sake of appearances, there's no point in regretting it now, there's only this one path to take. If I wait for him to initiate it, I'll have no foothold!" Yunqing said, "No, I only came to tell you today because I was so angry when I heard the news. The idea I came up with might not be appropriate, think about it some more!" Fengsheng said, "There's nothing to think about, I'll do it this way." Yunqing said, "I hope you'll think about it some more!" Fengsheng said, "Your idea is very beneficial to me, apart from this, I can't think of any other good solution." Yunqing said, "Then, you also have to observe the situation, don't start clashing as soon as you meet." Fengsheng said, "When do we not clash! You don't have to worry about that, I saw through it a long time ago. The two of us, husband and wife, won't be able to reconcile without going through a big storm." Hearing these words, Yunqing couldn't help but feel a stirring in her heart. These words have great insight, there's a lot to them. If I don't take advantage of her, I might be taken advantage of by her, and both sides will end up with nothing, then it wouldn't be worth it. This idea only sprouted in Yunqing's mind for a moment, and then passed. She immediately nodded and said, "I hope you'll be careful in everything, don't create trouble because of my being talkative." Fengsheng said, "Divorce between me and Zhuzhai is ultimately unavoidable, as long as he can agree to each and every condition I propose, it will be my victory. In the event that there are any twists and turns, I hope you can help again and give me a good idea." Yunqing repeatedly responded, "Yes, yes, I will definitely not withdraw from this, I can help at any time." The two talked for a while, and then Yunqing left. The next day when Zhuzhai came, Yunqing told him about the situation she had discussed with Fengsheng, which made Zhuzhai so happy that he bowed repeatedly. Yunqing said, "Don't be complacent, things are just starting, it's not over yet! I'm doing my best to help you, later on it will depend on your conscience. If you have other intentions and deceive me, I will retaliate by any means necessary!"

### Suburban Female Workers Respond to Group Scholarship Aid, Hoping to Inspire Compassion in Workers in All Cotton Mills

To the Editor: We are a group of female workers in a cotton mill, and we are fortunate to have the opportunity to study for free in the supplementary school attached to our factory. Seeing the proposal for the "Group Scholarship Aid" in your newspaper aroused our compassion, so we gathered the savings we had accumulated over time, raising one million yuan (sent by post, with a bank draft attached) to donate to the scholarship aid fund. We hope this will serve as a modest contribution to inspire resonance among the workers in the major cotton mills in Shanghai, and to jointly support this righteous cause. We sincerely wish you well. Respectfully, All the workers of Class B of the Huimin Workers' Supplementary School
