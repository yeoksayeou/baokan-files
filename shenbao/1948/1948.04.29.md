### The National Assembly Holds its Fourth Vote; Vice President to be Elected Today; Li and Sun Exert All Efforts to Win Votes

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The election of the Vice President is likely to reach its final result by noon on the 29th. After three rounds of voting among the six candidates, only Li Zongren and Sun Ke remain to participate in the fourth election on the 29th. This election will elect the candidate with the most votes, regardless of whether they exceed half the total. Unless the two candidates receive the same number of votes, in which case a fifth election will be held, the victor will be decided. The Presidium of the National Assembly held its forty-first meeting on the evening of the 28th. Chairman Zhang Zhenlu decided that the fourth Vice Presidential election would be held on the morning of the 29th, with Representative Yu Bin serving as chairman of the Assembly. The Vice Presidential ballots were printed on the afternoon of the 28th, using the same format as before. This time they are white paper with red characters, listing the names of Vice Presidential candidates Li Zongren and Sun Ke. On the evening of the 28th, Qian Dajun, Ma Wenche, and Li Zhongyang were appointed by the Presidium to supervise the sealing and safekeeping of the ballots. They will be unsealed in public on the morning of the 29th. One hundred and ten inspectors for the Assembly on the 29th have been drawn by lot, including Chen Yuguang and Zeng Baosun.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The Vice Presidential election has reached a critical juncture on the 29th. Candidates Li Zongren and Sun Ke will compete in the final round of the fourth Vice Presidential election. The voting results of the representatives will determine the fate of Li and Sun. Therefore, both sides exerted all efforts to win votes on the 28th. In particular, the representatives from Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Henan, who originally supported Cheng Qian, have become the main target of both sides' propaganda efforts. In the third election on the 28th, apart from Cheng Qian withdrawing from the final round because his vote count still ranked third, the votes for Li and Sun each had their own strengths and weaknesses. Li received 1163 votes in the second round of voting on the 24th, and 1156 votes in the third round of voting on the 28th, a decrease of seven votes. However, 2744 ballots were issued in the third round, and 2735 votes were cast, fewer than the 2765 ballots issued and 2760 votes cast in the second round on the 24th. Therefore, the reason for the decrease in Li's votes is likely due to the lower attendance. Sun received 1040 votes on the 28th, an increase of 95 votes compared to the 945 votes on the 24th. The vote counts for Li and Sun on the 28th were very close. Since only a plurality is required to win in the fourth vote on the 29th, and it is not necessary to exceed half the total number of representatives, even a single vote is worth fighting for. The Li and Sun campaign teams were active throughout the 28th, soliciting votes from the representatives. Li's wife, Guo Dejie, and Sun's wife, Chen Shuying, also spent the entire day campaigning. At 6:30 PM, Sun Ke hosted a banquet for representatives from Hunan and Hubei at the Legislative Yuan, delivering a speech on his political views, hoping that the representatives from Hunan and Hubei would support him so that he could be elected and realize his political views. After Sun Ke's banquet, the representatives from Hunan and Hubei attended Li Zongren's tea party at 8:30 PM. During the gathering, Li also delivered a speech, emphasizing that his proposed political reforms were the same as Cheng Qian's reform ideas, hoping that the representatives from Hunan and Hubei would transfer their enthusiasm for supporting Cheng to supporting his election. Sun Ke also scheduled a morning tea for representatives from Henan at 8:00 AM on the 29th, urging them to help him vote. Until late at night on the 28th, campaign workers from both sides were still visiting the residences of the representatives. The results of their activities will be concretely reflected in the voting records on the 29th.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The Presidium of the Assembly discussed the certificates of election for the President and Vice President at a meeting on the evening of the 28th and decided to present them on the morning of May 1st. The presentation ceremony will be held in the Assembly Hall. In addition to Yu Youren, who was previously scheduled to present the certificate, Hu Shi and Yu Bin were appointed on the 28th to welcome the President and Vice President on that day. The Presidium also discussed the ceremony for the presentation of the certificates at the meeting on the 28th, but it still needs to be submitted to the Assembly for approval. The Presidium is scheduled to hold another Assembly meeting on the morning of the 30th to discuss the unfinished proposals and the issues of permanent institutions. If progress is smooth, it can be adjourned in the afternoon of the 1st. However, the final confirmation will depend on the outcome of the Vice Presidential election on the 29th.

### Third Vote Proceeds Smoothly; None of the Three Candidates Receives the Required Legal Majority; Fourth Election to be Held Today with Li and Sun as Candidates

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The National Assembly held its third Vice Presidential election on the morning of the 28th, proceeding smoothly with the vote. However, the number of votes received by all three Vice Presidential candidates did not reach the required majority. Li Zongren received 1156 votes, Sun Ke received 1040 votes, and Cheng Qian received 515 votes. According to the provisions of the Election and Recall Law, a fourth vote should be held between the top two candidates, with each representative selecting one of them. The Assembly on the 28th was held at 9:35 AM, with Hu Shi presiding. 2744 representatives were present. Secretary-General Hong Lanyou first read two reports from the Presidium: (1) The results of the second re-election of the Vice President on the 24th showed that none of the Vice Presidential candidates, Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian, received the legally required majority of votes. According to the provisions of Article 4, Paragraph 3, Item 2 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, a third vote should be held to select one candidate. (2) The Presidium successively received requests from Vice Presidential candidates Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and Sun Ke to renounce their qualifications as Vice Presidential candidates. The Presidium decided at its 36th meeting to recommend to the five representatives Hu Shi, Yu Bin, Zeng Baosun, Chen Qitian, and Sun Yaofu that the three Vice Presidential candidates continue their campaigns. Representative Yu Bin was appointed to report the results of the interviews. Yu Bin then reported on the process, stating that on the 25th of this month, the Presidium received requests from Mr. Li, Mr. Sun, and Mr. Cheng to renounce their qualifications as Vice Presidential candidates. The Presidium discussed this at its 36th meeting, believing that each candidate had been nominated by hundreds of people. The election was already underway and had reached the third vote. In order to ensure the smooth progress of the Assembly, five representatives were appointed to visit the three candidates and persuade them to continue. The results were very good, and all three candidates no longer insisted on renouncing their candidacy. Therefore, the Presidium decided to hold the third Vice Presidential election today. Chairman Hu Shi stated: "Mr. Yu Bin has reported on the process on behalf of the Presidium and explained the Presidium's views. Can the Assembly no longer consider this and proceed with the election process?" The motion was passed with applause. The Chairman announced that today's Assembly would be changed to the third Vice Presidential election. He then asked Bai Chongxi, a representative of the Presidium, to report on the temporary proposals regarding the order of the election. Mr. Bai then announced a temporary proposal from 823 people, which stated that effective measures should be taken to prevent manipulation, control, and threats to the election, and that Chairman Chiang should be invited to report to the Assembly on the methods for a free election for the Vice President. Mr. Bai further explained that voting in the Assembly was absolutely free, ballots must be folded, and not shown to others. He also said: "Chairman Chiang has personally instructed me to explain that he completely supports the representatives voting according to their free will. I hereby convey this to all representatives. At this critical moment of suppressing the rebellion, I hope that the Assembly can be successfully completed, and that everyone can return to their original posts and engage in suppressing the rebellion." After Mr. Bai's report, the Secretary-General reported on the election procedures and the names of those responsible for monitoring the voting and counting. By 10:30 AM, all procedures had been prepared, and voting began. At 11:01 AM, voting was completed. At 11:40 AM, the ballots were opened. At 1:11 PM, the opening of the twelve ballot boxes was completed. A total of 2744 ballots were issued, and 2735 votes were cast, including 24 invalid votes. The total number of valid votes was 2711. The Chairman reported the results, stating: "According to the voting results today, Li Zongren received the most votes, with 1156 votes, followed by Sun Ke with 1040 votes, and Cheng Qian with 515 votes. According to the Election and Recall Law, none of the candidates received a majority, and a Vice President cannot be produced. A fourth vote should be held, with the two candidates receiving the most votes in today's vote as candidates, and one of them selected." The fourth vote was scheduled for 9:00 AM on the following day. After Mr. Hu's report, he announced the adjournment of the meeting.

### Failure in the Election, Victory in Morality; Cheng Qian Thanks Voters in the Peacock Hall, Expressing His Feelings

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] At 6:00 PM on the 28th, more than 600 National Assembly representatives and members of Cheng Qian's campaign team who supported Cheng Qian's election gathered in the Peacock Hall of the Central Hotel. Cheng entered the hall amidst enthusiastic applause and delivered an impromptu speech, saying: "This election has been fully supported by the representatives, which can be said to be entirely out of a sense of justice and a true vote of conscience. The results of the third election on the 28th were within my expectations, but my only wish was for the smooth progress of the Assembly, so I reluctantly agreed to run. Although I received few votes today, I still consider it the greatest honor and pleasure. I express my heartfelt gratitude to the representatives for their enthusiastic support today. After today's election, some friends have asked me how they should vote tomorrow. I have told them all to follow the principle of free voting and cast their sacred vote for the candidate who is closest to their ideals. I personally will do the same. I have views and opinions on politics. All of you present today are my friends of morality and adversity. I would like to invite you again after the Assembly adjourns to exchange views on the current situation." After Cheng's speech, Tang Shizun and Zhao Hengti delivered speeches, both emphasizing that Cheng Qian's appeal this time was based on moral character. Although he had failed in the election battle, he had won in the moral battle, and the future would be the beginning of the struggle for morality.

### National Assembly Chronicles: After the Rain, the Sky Clears, the Election Tide Calms Down - Who Will Be the Vice President? To Be Continued...

[Special Correspondent] The Vice Presidential election is the climax of the entire agenda of this National Assembly. The joint statement by the three Vice Presidential candidates renouncing their campaigns is the peak of this climax. However, the handling of this peak was done with a rather long period of cooling down. The unpredictable twists and turns of the past three days have been clearly explained through this highly skilled cooling down process. The Assembly on the 28th was finally able to proceed smoothly, giving people a subtle feeling of hope after despair.

Looking back at what happened in the past three days, it is like a dream. The depression of dark clouds without rain, the tension of tightened heartstrings, the suspicion of shifting east and west, and the rumors flying around could hardly be found in the Assembly hall on the 28th. The weather was gentle and sunny, the clear sky was without a trace of clouds. The magnificent Assembly hall was still reflected in the national flag, and the cars and horses at the door were as busy as ever. General Li Zongren and his wife, Guo Dejie, stood shoulder to shoulder on the steps in front of the main entrance, while the wife of President Sun stood on the right side of the second entrance. They all smiled and shook hands with the attendees, greeting them and thanking them. Except for the lack of intense emotions, everything was the same as the day before yesterday. The representatives in the Assembly hall were also leisurely chatting with acquaintances or sitting alone reading newspapers. Not a single piece of propaganda was seen, and no one even mentioned the cooling down of the past two days. The common topic was:

"How have you been spending the past two days?"

But at the beginning of the meeting, it was almost unbelievable. In fact, this relaxed exterior still concealed a tense heart. "Has something happened?" "Can the election be successfully completed?" Everyone was apprehensive. The Assembly was like a ship sailing through a winding canyon. There were visible tree stumps and rocks, and invisible weeds and reefs. But thanks to the good pilots, they managed to navigate this course smoothly. The Vice Presidential election safely entered the final stage.

The Chairman of the Assembly was President Hu Shi. He and Secretary-General Hong Lanyou carefully and calmly maintained the order of the meeting and the progress of the conference. The first to report on behalf of the Presidium was Bishop Yu Bin. He clearly reported that the meeting had been adjourned for the past two days due to the fact that the three Vice Presidential candidates had successively declared their renunciation of the campaign. However, after the Presidium sent representatives to persuade them, the problem had been resolved. The Presidium then decided to continue with the third election, without further discussion by the Assembly. This decision was solemnly requested by Chairman Hu to be agreed upon by the Assembly, and it passed the first dangerous shoal amidst thunderous applause. Next, General Bai Chongxi reported on behalf of the Presidium on a temporary motion from more than 800 people. The motion was to request the Presidium to take effective measures to prevent manipulation, control, and threats to the election in the Assembly hall. This motion originally made many people sweat, worrying that it would cause a storm. But General Bai's report presented the results of the Presidium's consideration of the measures proposed in this motion, one by one. He said:

"The Presidium believes that there are absolutely no problems with voting in the Assembly hall. The election is absolutely free. Everyone should automatically protect their right to secrecy and not show their votes to others. As for outside the Assembly hall, Chairman Chiang has repeatedly stated that he absolutely supports all representatives voting according to their free will." He also believes that everyone hopes that the tasks of the Assembly can be completed smoothly as soon as possible so that they can go back to execute the suppression of rebellion.

At 9:55 AM, Chairman Hu announced that the third Vice Presidential election would be held. Secretary-General Hong and the staff of the Assembly demonstrated an even faster, more rigorous, and careful work ethic. Blotting paper was added to the writing rooms. "Representatives should walk on the main road" (according to a certain representative). "No Assembly hall staff member is allowed to stand," "Please do not whisper in the Assembly hall" (according to a certain representative), "The 'attachments' of the inspectors and female representatives can be temporarily stored on the podium." After Secretary-General Hong's repeated and detailed reports and explanations, a different order of districts was used than in the previous two elections. At 10:30 AM, voting began, and under the unprecedentedly excellent order, the entire voting time took only 50 minutes. By 11:30 AM, the ballot opening arrangements were completed. Five minutes later, Chairman Hu announced the start of the ballot opening. At this time, Liu Huan, the female representative who had been appointed to verify the ballots, refused to step onto the stage, but she finally relented amidst applause.

The twelve ballot boxes were opened. The first ballot was for Cheng Qian, followed by Sun Ke and Li Zongren side by side. Sun Ke took the lead in the first and second ballot boxes. Li Zongren took the lead in the third ballot box. Sun Ke rebounded in the sixth ballot box. Li Zongren's vote count dropped sharply in the seventh ballot box, but he still took the lead. This situation continued until the end. Li Zongren still took the lead in the third round, Sun Ke followed closely, and Cheng Qian was far behind. The situation was very clear: Li Zongren's situation remained the same, Sun Ke was improving day by day, and some of Cheng Qian's voters had followed Sun Ke. In general, Li Zongren and Sun Ke were in close combat. After Chairman Hu announced at 1:20 PM that the fourth Vice Presidential election would be held tomorrow, everyone was thinking:

"Who will be the victor tomorrow?" (April 28th, Nanjing)

### National Assembly Delegate Shi Changbi, Who Lost the Election, Went on a Hunger Strike and Was Sent to the Hospital for Recuperation, but Disappeared; Spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior Clarifies the Truth

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior stated: "Mr. Shi Changbi was a National Assembly delegate candidate nominated by a political party for Qianyang County, Hunan Province. As a result of the election, he received a relatively small number of votes. Before and after the National Assembly convened, he repeatedly came to the Ministry of the Interior to meet with Minister Zhang. On the 7th of this month, Shi walked into the Minister's office on his own. After being greeted and asked to wait until the Minister arrived, Shi announced that he would go on a hunger strike and refused to leave the office. The Ministry sent personnel to persuade him earnestly, but to no avail. We then persuaded him to eat and prepared milk, biscuits, tea, and water for him to eat from time to time. By the next day, he was eating normally and even personally wrote out a menu, ordering the workers to prepare it, which became his daily routine. Later, the Ministry set up a bed and provided him with a quilt so that he could rest comfortably. However, on the 19th of this month, Shi Changbi suddenly announced another hunger strike (but still ate delicious dishes and drank water) and presented Minister Zhang with written conditions: (A) Immediately stop Pan Zhuangfei from attending the National Assembly and publish a statement of facts, ordering a re-election and issuing a certificate of election based on the results of the re-election; (B) Send him abroad to study and implement the National Assembly distribution method proposed by the Central Government, etc. On the 23rd, he personally proposed: (A) Guarantee his appointment as Vice Chairman or Secretary-General of the War Suppression and Nation Building Committee and announce it within days, otherwise Comrade Shi will request fulfillment in any way; (B) Subsidize Comrade Shi with 400 million yuan. If the Central Government has a subsidy, it will be tripled according to the Central Government's regulations, and an additional 50 million yuan will be provided for hospital treatment; (C) The method for Comrade Shi to serve as a National Assembly delegate for four years after his appointment will still be implemented; (D) Punish Pan Zhuangfei, at least preventing him from serving as a member of the War Suppression and Nation Building Committee or other positions, etc. The above conditions also require Minister Zhang to sign, and there is also a statement that 'Do not turn this short-term issue into a lifelong entanglement between us, so that I will come to disturb your peace of mind at any time in the future,' etc. Because Shi claimed to be on a hunger strike when he first arrived at the Ministry, although he did not actually do so, in order to determine responsibility, our colleagues discussed asking the Nan District Police Department to send personnel to serve him to prevent accidents. His daily life, the letters he sent, and the guests he met are all recorded by the police. Later, on the 24th of this month, Shi expressed his wish to be hospitalized for recuperation. The director of the Nan District Police Department, Mr. Shu, and our colleagues persuaded him to move to the Central Hospital for recuperation and sent him to the Central Hospital by car on the same day, opening room 414. Today, we received an official letter from the Central Hospital on the 26th, which stated that 'Yesterday at 3:30 PM and 3:35 PM, the doctor went to administer injections and examinations twice, but both times he refused. After reporting to the Director of Internal Medicine, we went to see him again at 3:45 PM and found that Mr. Shi was no longer in the room, and the accompanying staff were also looking for him.' According to our investigation, Shi's personal actions were very free when he was in the Ministry, going to various offices to find people and make phone calls. In the hospital, his personal freedom of action was still unrestricted. We are afraid that the outside world does not understand the truth, so we declare the details as above."

### Fierce Street Fighting in Weixian

Reinforcements Cross Yidu and Continue Eastward

[Our Jinan Correspondent, 28th] In Weixian East City, from the 27th to the 28th, for 24 hours, the defending troops were still engaged in fierce street fighting with the invading Communist bandits. The troops attacking from Changle, in conjunction with the Air Force, made considerable gains. The reinforcements advancing eastward crossed Yidu on the 28th and continued eastward. They may join forces with the troops attacking from Changle near Yangjiazhuang on the evening of the 28th. The two wings of the eastward advancing troops are rapidly sweeping south of Yidu and northeast of Linzi.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Weixian is in danger. Shandong has urgently telegraphed National Assembly representatives from Shandong in Beijing for help, requesting that the reinforcements that have crossed Yidu advance quickly. It is reported that the National Army defending Weixian has broken through the siege. The local troops led by Zhang Tianzuo and others, after many days of hard fighting, have only about 1,000 people left and have suffered heavy losses.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 28th] The main force of the bandit's 13th Column, 37th and 38th Divisions, which was besieged by the National Army in Nanbei Shaling (Pingdu County), broke through the siege on the afternoon of the 27th and fled north. A certain Brigade Commander led his troops in a fierce pursuit. The entire 117th Regiment of the bandit's 38th Division was annihilated near Nan Shaling. As of the time of the dispatch, more than 300 bandits below the battalion commander level had been captured, and more than 10 heavy machine guns, 10 mortars, and more than 300 rifles had been seized.

### Communist Army in Northern Chahar Retreats Completely

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 28th] The North China Suppression Headquarters reports: The Communist bandits disturbing Baochang and Duolun in northern Chahar have retreated completely. The National Army has arrived successively and is cooperating with local teams to encircle and suppress them along the Duolun County border. More than 500 bandits retreating southeast from Baochang began to retreat in separate groups to the southeast this morning. More than 200 were killed or wounded by the Air Force's strafing on the 27th.

### 37 Villages and Towns Captured Along the Pingjin Highway

### The "Arctic" Vessel Escapes Danger and Safely Arrives at Huludao

[Our Shenyang Correspondent, 28th] The "Arctic" warship, which was captured by bandits in the Yingkou battle, safely escaped danger on the 26th and arrived at Huludao. After leaving Yingkou, the ship ran aground at the mouth of the Liao River. It was later rescued by the "Chang Sheng" and "Yong Zhi" ships. The rumor that the "Arctic" was destroyed is inaccurate.

### Liu Bocheng Rumored to be Injured

[Our Xinyang Correspondent, 28th] It is rumored that Liu Bocheng was seriously injured on the Huaihai front line and is currently being treated in Guchengzhai.

### Yu Youren's Birthday is Filled with Guests; Chairman Chiang and His Wife Personally Offer Congratulations; The Birthday Celebrant Visited Tangshan Yesterday in High Spirits

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The President of the Control Yuan, Yu Youren, celebrated his 70th birthday on the 28th. From 7:00 AM, well-wishers arrived one after another. Chairman Chiang and his wife went to his residence in person at 11:00 AM to offer their congratulations. At that time, the courtyard was crowded with guests. Chairman Chiang and his wife walked slowly across the lawn, congratulated Yu amidst the crowd, and took a photo to commemorate the occasion. They then entered the birthday hall for a short rest, staying for about 20 minutes before leaving. Yu's residence was filled with joy today. Wu Dingchang, Sun Ke, and others sent valuable flower baskets, which were displayed in the room. The birthday hall was simply decorated, with Chairman Chiang's congratulatory message in the center, and congratulatory items from Ju Zheng, Dai Chuanxian, Zhang Qun, Sun Ke, and Chen Bulei hung all around. Today's guests included party, government, and military leaders in the capital, as well as National Assembly representatives, totaling no less than 3,000 people. Yu personally greeted the guests and took photos with them frequently. At about 2:00 PM, feeling tired from the greetings, he drove to Tangshan for a short visit, strolling among the beautiful scenery, in high spirits, and returned at 6:00 PM. While Yu was on his outing, many guests continued to arrive, and they were greeted by the Secretary-General of the Control Yuan, Li Chongxian, and others, who provided tea and refreshments. The number of guests today was unprecedented. This is not only because Yu is a founding member of the party and the country, but also because of the demeanor of a democratic statesman that he has displayed since participating in the Vice Presidential election, which is especially admirable. As the birthday couplet presented by Mr. and Mrs. Bu Lizi said: "His demeanor is truly democratic, his spirit is of an old man but as young as youth."

### The Communist Bandits Within Baoji Are Eliminated; Qishan and Fengxiang Are Both Recovered; In the Battle of Bin County, an Entire Regiment of Bandits Surrenders

[Our Correspondent, Xi'an, 28th] The National Army, advancing westward along the highway from Fufeng, crossed Yidian Town and recovered Qishan County seat on the evening of the 27th. It is continuing to push westward smoothly, with advanced units already entering the territories of Fengxiang and Baoji counties.

[Our Correspondent, Lanzhou, 28th] The National Army is progressing rapidly on the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway, and the highway between Xi'an and Yongshou is clear and unblocked.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 8th] The National Army advancing westward along both sides of the Longhai Railway is progressing rapidly. On the evening of the 27th, they captured Qishan County seat and Caijiapo in the industrial district. They then took advantage of their momentum and advanced rapidly, capturing Tongzhen and Fengxiang in succession on the morning of the 28th. Baoji, an important town in western Shaanxi that had been temporarily harassed by bandits, has also been completely secured by the National Army, turning danger into safety. The bandits in these areas, under the sweep of our large army, are like fallen leaves in the autumn wind, with heavy casualties. It is estimated that over 20,000 bandits have been annihilated by the National Army in recent days. Having suffered such a heavy blow, the bandits are terrified and are now fleeing blindly towards the northwest. The National Army is pursuing and intercepting them along multiple routes, and is continuing to expand its gains.

[Further Telegram] After the communist bandits in Baoji were completely eliminated by the National Army, there are no longer any traces of bandits along the entire line from Longxi to Baoji. The Railway Bureau has issued an order to rush the repair of the road and to restore traffic as soon as possible. Traffic was restored to Wugong on the 28th, and is expected to extend to Jiangzhang on the 29th.

[Our Correspondent, Lanzhou, 28th] In the battle of Bin County, a cavalry unit of a certain reorganized division in eastern Gansu defeated the main force of the Sixth Column of communist bandits and parts of the First and Fourth Columns. An entire regiment of the Sixth Column of communist bandits surrendered to our forces, and over one hundred pieces of heavy weaponry, new weapons, communications equipment, and countless light and heavy weapons were seized. The two National Army forces that joined forces in Bin County are currently clearing the battlefield and pursuing the remaining bandits. The retreat route of the remaining bandits on the south bank of the Jing River has been clearly cut off, and it will not be difficult to wipe them out in one fell swoop. The bandits have been eliminated and order has been restored in Fufeng, Yongshou, Wugong, Qian County, and Liquan counties, and righteous people are returning to their hometowns one after another. A certain military observer praised the battle of Bin County as the beginning of stabilizing the Northwest.

[Our Correspondent, Xi'an, 28th] The Air Force Third Military District Headquarters announced at 6:00 PM that our Air Force launched sorties from dawn to dusk on the 28th to assist in the fighting at the front. Powerful formations of aircraft fiercely attacked the bandits east of the Luo River and covered our army's advance westward from Hengshui (west of Qishan). Our aircraft discovered our army engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits on a mountain range seven kilometers west of Huanglong Mountain. They immediately bombed and strafed the bandit concentrations, killing over 500 bandits. Our aircraft also strafed over one hundred bandit cavalrymen on a road ten kilometers northwest of Chengcheng, and over a thousand bandits and over one hundred vehicles, fully loaded with supplies and heading west, on the highway west of Yangcheng. Upon discovery by our aircraft, they were bombed and strafed, and the bandits suffered heavy losses.

### Rescuing the Crisis in Northeast Education

The war clouds over the Northeast have recently tended to subside, but they are still amidst ominous calm and frequent alarms of war. The suffering of our compatriots in the Northeast is very distressing. The maintenance of education in the Northeast, as well as the reception of young people fleeing from evacuated cities, deserves our concern. The education proposals in the recent National Assembly also included suggestions for rescuing displaced students. As we look at the current education in the Northeast, it is not just a matter of rescuing those who have lost their schooling.

Last month, Huang Zengming, chief inspector of the Ministry of Education, was ordered to inspect education in the Northeast, including Shenyang and Changchun. He has been back in Nanjing for a month, but the rumored plan of the Ministry of Education to establish schools in Beiping to accommodate young people from evacuated middle schools and universities in the Northeast has not yet materialized. We have not seen Huang's full report, but based on the news revealed in the newspapers and the reports from our correspondent in Shenyang over the past two months, the current state of education in the National Army-controlled areas of the Northeast is precarious.

The overall situation of the country is difficult, and the entire education system has been directly and indirectly affected, requiring comprehensive rescue and solutions. However, rescuing the crisis in Northeast education is a fundamental matter related to the lifeline of our education and the future of the nation. It should be observed with special consideration and planned separately. The Ministry of Education bears the responsibility for the education and culture of the country and should not only engage in dealing with minor or local issues but should also consider the entire long-term strategy. What was the point of the eight-year War of Resistance? To recover sovereignty and restore territory. The object of this recovery of lost territory is the Northeast, which was occupied for fourteen years after the September 18th Incident and returned to the embrace of the motherland after victory. Today, the communist bandits are occupying parts of China, but this is a temporary phenomenon. If the education authorities disregard Northeast education, it will be a sign that our government is neglecting this vast territory and would also diminish the sacred significance of China's War of Resistance. Therefore, the government authorities and people from all walks of life must jointly devote all their efforts to rescuing the crisis in Northeast education.

First, regarding higher education: we advocate that Northeast University, which is on the "edge of the battlefield," should complete its relocation to Beiping before the summer vacation. This does not mean that the National Army is preparing to withdraw from Shenyang, but on the contrary, to cooperate with the National Army's planned defense and offensive, Shenyang temporarily lacks a stable environment in which higher education can be conducted. It is said that the current situation is that relocation and non-relocation are equally difficult, with economic factors being the main concern. However, based on past experience during the War of Resistance and international opinion, only relocation to a more stable area can maintain its development. As for colleges and universities, some departments that can cooperate with the suppression of communist military affairs can allow students to voluntarily remain or be transferred to the front lines to assist in the suppression of the rebellion (such as political work, or defense works, or industrial and mining recovery). For Northeast University or the Northeast Temporary United University after relocation, the first thing to do is to strictly screen students' grades to re-determine their year level, being strict rather than lenient. Secondly, their equipment should be enriched, especially the facilities of the engineering school, which should be based on the principle of meeting the needs of restoring Northeast's industrial construction because higher education creates specialists and must focus on the long-term future. In addition, young people in the Northeast were controlled by the enemy's and puppet's policy of misleading the people during the war. Their knowledge of the country's language, history, and geography is either low or wrong. Therefore, common prerequisite courses must always strengthen the teachers and teaching materials of literature and history education. As for the issue of transferring and boarding for students from Northeast colleges and universities, due to the limitation of their level, they should not hesitate to demote them, and public and private universities in Beiping and Tianjin should have a sympathetic attitude and consider accepting them appropriately.

Secondly, regarding primary and secondary education, according to a Shenyang telegram from our newspaper on March 10, it said: "Secondary schools cannot escape the nature of relief, with few schools and many students," and "Primary schools are poor, and national education is almost entirely abandoned." We can hardly imagine the actual situation of primary and secondary education in various places in the Northeast. The education in the areas occupied by the communist bandits is even more unbearable to mention. Even if the above report is an exaggeration, the severity of the schools' teachers and funding in the Northeast amidst soaring prices must be ten times greater than that of Nanjing and Shanghai. National education in the Northeast is precisely to re-educate "new citizens" for the country to replace and correct the past absurd education of the Japanese puppets and to lay a new foundation for the country's political recovery. With such an important mission and the current situation like this, this is not just an educational problem. We urge the Northeast military and political authorities to face the reality, plan for the future, and request the central government and raise huge funds locally to retain a large number of capable and knowledgeable people to stay and manage national education, especially instilling national consciousness, the results of the War of Resistance, and the solemn significance of the suppression of the rebellion, so that thriving primary school students can understand right and wrong, and become cadres who will rebuild the Northeast in the future and truly patriotic citizens. Secondary education should also adhere to the principle of "rather have less than have inferior," screen, merge, and improve teachers, and for the need to adapt to future construction, prevent the contradiction between further education and employment, and should develop various different secondary vocational education from the perspective of adapting to local conditions. As for how to supply nationally approved teaching materials, facilitate the transportation and publication of beneficial books and periodicals, and ban low-level and reactionary publications to assist in the development of sound popular education, it is also equally dependent on the central education authorities' guidance and assistance, and is not only the local authorities' unshirkable task.

Finally, there is one more point that I would like to simply express for the people of the Northeast: from the historical and geographical conditions, especially after the painful experience of more than 20 years of Japanese puppet occupation, it has been clearly proven that the Northeast is an inseparable part of our entire China, and an independent China cannot exist without the Northeast. Therefore, the construction and revitalization of the Northeast must rely on the efforts of all Chinese people. Northeast education cannot be borne by the people of the nine provinces of the Northeast alone. Therefore, we must break the old concept of Northeast people running Northeast education themselves. To correct the old abuses and enrich the national consciousness, and to improve science to meet the needs of industrial recovery, we must break down barriers and welcome talents from all over the country to the Northeast to jointly undertake the great cause of cultivating talents and revitalizing the Northeast.

It is clear that this treaty is the foundation of China's independence and security."

"There is no doubt that the Chinese people and progressives attach great importance to this treaty, especially now that some people are sparing no effort to restore Japanese militarism and Japan's industrial war potential. The friendship and alliance between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is the foundation of peace and security in the Far East."

### Salaries and Income Taxes of Public Education, Military, and Police Personnel Will Be Resumed Starting in April

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 28th] A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance recently talked about the taxation of salaries of public education personnel and said: The income tax on salaries of public education, military, and police personnel was originally levied based on base salary, and living allowances were not included. At that time, the income amount did not reach the taxation standard, so in fact it was equivalent to tax exemption. However, due to the exemption of income tax for public education personnel and employees of state-owned enterprises, the impact extended to general employees who all used this as an excuse not to pay taxes, resulting in huge losses in national tax revenue. Now the Income Tax Law has been revised and promulgated. The regulations on the starting point and tax rate for fixed salary income tax stipulate that the starting point is adjusted three times a year in April, July, and October according to the cost of living index of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. The starting point for this year's tax collection from April has been raised to 7.91 million yuan per month, and the tax rate has been reduced to 1%. Only those with a monthly income of over 52.74 million yuan will be subject to progressive tax on the excess part. The chief accountants of various agencies and enterprises or the persons in charge of various profit-making enterprises and other employers are responsible for withholding and paying the tax. At present, the monthly income of the highest-level specially appointed officials is less than 30 million yuan, so in addition to the 1% tax, there is no excess tax. The tax burden is small, but it is of great benefit to the treasury. This Ministry has submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval and will resume the collection of income tax on the salaries of public education, military, and police personnel starting in April. At the same time, it has strictly ordered various bureaus to universally collect income tax on the salaries of employees in various industries, so as to evenly distribute the burden.

### Unveiling the Mystery of Mount積石: The Remaining Question Is How to Open the Door to the Natural Treasure House

— Our Reporter Hong Xucai

[Our Special Report] "Mount積石 does not have high peaks; Mount Everest still holds the throne as the world's highest mountain." Since the Central Air Transport Corporation's exploration plane completed its mission, the mystery of Mount積石 has been unveiled, but people should not be satisfied with this, because exploration work should include various scientific studies and explorations. Mapping the terrain, measuring longitude and latitude, studying ancient glacier remains, and investigating geology, minerals, flora, fauna, races, languages, customs, etc., can fully realize the glory of this virgin land that has not been reclaimed!

This reporter participated in the Central Air Transport Corporation's exploration team and soared over Mount積石 for eleven hours. Afterwards, I visited several experts to ask about the theme of Mount積石. I would like to give a faithful report on the current situation of Mount積石 that I have seen with my own eyes.

Mount積石 is located in the border area of Qinghai, Gansu, and Xikang provinces. The Qinghai people call it Maqin Snow Mountain. 阿尼瑪卿 is a transliteration of the Tibetan language, meaning "lofty old man." The locals are superstitious and worship all mountains as "gods," and Mount 阿尼瑪卿 is considered "Buddha," the "ancestor who created the world."

Mount積石 has attracted attention because of its high altitude. It is also a historically famous mountain in China, possibly older than the Himalayas. The name "Mount積石" was found in the "Tribute of Yu," which would have been before the Han Dynasty. From the plane, the Mount積石 I saw had few steep cliffs and mostly resembled an upside-down bowl, with no strange peaks rising around it. According to geographical knowledge, mountains that have been around for a long time are gradually smoothed and lowered by wind and rain erosion, so there is probably no doubt that Mount積石 has a long history.

Looking down from the high altitude, the top of Mount積石 is covered with ice and snow. I simply cannot believe that there could be any plants or trees growing on the mountain, but according to experts, there may be life below the snow line. It's just that it cannot be seen with the naked eye from the plane. It is speculated that those plants and animals must be similar to those in the Arctic Circle, such as polar bears and antelopes. As for whether the mountains contain valuable minerals, that is naturally not something that can be conjectured out of thin air. Tibetans widely believe that 阿尼瑪卿 is the birthplace of Tsongkhapa, and the gold of the tiles of Kumbum Monastery was mined from 阿尼瑪卿.

Mount積石 is located at the first bend of the Yellow River. Its direction is from northwest, winding down to southeast. The further east it goes, the lower the mountain becomes. The Yellow River bends north between Gongma Sangla, and the mountain disappears. To find high peaks, you must start in the northwest. According to the observation of the geographer Huang Jiqing, Mount積石 seems unlikely to have high peaks because: (1) Mount積石 is surrounded by the Yellow River on three sides and a plateau on one side. The height of the Yellow River is only 3,000 meters. It is abnormal for a mountain more than 5,000 meters higher than the river to appear in this narrow area. (2) High mountain areas, such as the Himalayas and Karakoram, are often layers upon layers of mountains. However, Mount積石 is isolated, descending directly to the Yellow River on both sides. (3) In terms of geological structure, the highest peaks of the world's major continents are the product of the Alpine orogeny and are new fold mountains. Mount積石 is an ancient Paleozoic fold mountain, an old mountain, not a new mountain, and its height should be inferior to new fold mountains. However, there is another argument that Mount積石 is a fault-block mountain. The Yellow River flows along its north-south fault lines, or the intrusion of a large intrusive rock mass can create a height that exceeds it.

Regardless of which of the above two theories is correct, according to the actual measurements of the Central Air Transport Corporation's exploration plane, it is confirmed that there are indeed no peaks on Mount積石 exceeding 20,000 feet. Now that the mystery has been solved, what remains is how to open the door to this natural treasure house and write a new page for world history, geology, biology, and ethnology.

Sa Bendong and others from the Academia Sinica are busy collecting data and burying themselves in hard work. This epoch-making exploration is expected to begin in the clear and refreshing autumn season. At that time, high-altitude detection and ground surveys will be carried out simultaneously. This reporter had the opportunity to fly over Mount積石 on a special plane. I have recorded in detail the flight route, the height, temperature, air pressure, and flight altitude of each mountain that was passed. Now, I have specially organized them. If they can be used as a reference for the second exploration, then my hard work will not have been in vain.

### Arab League Assures Marshall Arab Forces Will Not Invade Holy Land Marshall Believes This Guarantee Is Limited To The Current Situation British Forces Join Arab-Jewish Battle for Jaffa

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 28th Broadcast: Secretary of State Marshall told reporters today that a spokesperson for the Arab League has assured him that Arab forces will not invade Palestine. However, Marshall believes that this guarantee is limited to the current situation. Another report: British tanks joined the Arab-Jewish war today in an attempt to force the Arab forces in Jaffa back to the sea, but the battle for Jaffa has intensified, and the Arab forces have tightened their encirclement of the city.

[Reuters Jerusalem, 28th] The Irgun forces continue to attack Jaffa, ignoring the warnings of the British forces. The British forces have mobilized to fight against the 2,000 Irgun soldiers.

[Reuters Tel Aviv, 28th] The Irgun announced on the afternoon of the 28th that the Arab forces in Jaffa have surrendered. The Jews were overjoyed at the news, and the streets were crowded. The Irgun forces have been heavily shelling Jaffa with mortars since this morning, and machine-gun bullets have been sweeping the Arab positions like raindrops.

[Associated Press London, 28th] Foreign Minister Bevin refused to state in the House of Commons today whether Britain would provide money, arms, and officers to assist the Transjordan Arab army after the end of the British mandate in Palestine.

[Associated Press Jerusalem, 28th] King Abdullah of Transjordan notified the Associated Press by telephone from the capital today that the vanguard of the Arab army he commands, which is attacking Palestine, has occupied the Jordan Valley, which is located twenty miles northeast of Jerusalem.

[Reuters Jerusalem, 27th] The British-equipped Arab Legion of King Abdullah of Transjordan has been digging trenches and deploying defenses on both sides of the Allenby Bridge, the corridor through which it is invading Palestine from the Kingdom of Transjordan, eighteen days before the end of British rule in Palestine. It is rumored in Cairo that regular Arab armies are about to invade Palestine, while in Tel Aviv, the Haganah army announced that it had reached a military cooperation agreement with the terrorist organization Irgun. Cairo observers, commenting on the military pact signed in Amman, the capital of Transjordan, by Transjordan, Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria, predict that the regular Arab armies will launch a three-pronged offensive against Haganah and Irgun, and Egypt will supply aircraft and warships to blockade the Palestinian coast.

[Associated Press Jerusalem, 27th] According to Arab sources, an Egyptian armored division crossed the southern border and entered Palestine at dawn today, but Cairo denied it, saying that regular Egyptian troops did not enter the Holy Land, but rather volunteers.

[Reuters Jerusalem, 28th] Jewish forces continue to attack in Palestine, and thousands of refugees are flocking to Transjordan, Syria, and Lebanon to escape. Official reports have confirmed that the claim that Transjordanian troops have invaded Palestine is inaccurate.

The Trusteeship Council was instructed by the General Assembly to quickly submit a plan that could at least protect the Holy City amid the increasing turmoil in Palestine, so it has now decided to immediately conduct secret consultations with Jews and Arabs.

Before holding these secret consultations, the Trusteeship Council heard a brief summary from French representative Garreau of France's proposal to organize an international guard force of 1,000 people to protect Jerusalem. The French representative also proposed that the guard force be commanded by a special officer appointed by the United Nations based on nominations by the Trusteeship Council. At today's meeting of the Trusteeship Council, the Soviet representative attended for the first time, but Soviet representative Tsarapkin remained silent throughout the meeting. In addition, the Political Committee, composed of the 58 member states of the United Nations, also concluded its general debate on the Palestine issue and turned to discussing whether the US proposal for a Palestine trusteeship should raise the procedure of the General Assembly's Trusteeship Committee. As a result of the debate, it was decided by a vote of 38 to 7 (with 7 abstentions) to discuss it immediately without submitting it to the General Assembly's Trusteeship Committee.

Must Maintain Consistency Marshall Emphasizes This Point in Speech to Chamber of Commerce

He said: Foreign newspapers have a natural tendency to overemphasize formal contradictions, which basically do not exist. He suggested that the United States must not allow any doubts about its ability to carry out various policies.

### Mobil Oil Tanker Radioed from Shanghai: Corpse and Smuggled Goods Found Onboard, Customs Sends Patrol Boat to Intercept and Search

[Our Newspaper Report] The Mobil Oil Company's oil tanker "Charles Meyer," en route from Persia to Shanghai, discovered a large quantity of contraband and the corpses of two Chinese sailors in a secret compartment on board. The captain has urgently telegraphed the Shanghai Mobil Oil Company. The ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. The company has reported the matter to Customs to make necessary arrangements. Upon the ship's arrival, it will be subjected to a thorough search.

The "Charles Meyer" comes from the Persian Gulf, carrying 5,000 tons of oil to Hong Kong and 9,000 tons to Shanghai. The nature and quantity of the contraband currently discovered is unknown, as the captain's telegram was vague. However, it is known that the two bodies were discovered in a box-shaped small compartment installed on the side of the ship for ease of repair. This box-shaped gate is airtight and not ventilated, making it an ideal place to hide smuggled goods. However, due to lack of air circulation, carbon monoxide produced therein may cause smugglers to die from poisoning. Previously, customs officers in this city had fainted while inspecting a ship's box-shaped gate due to foul air inside. Thus, the bodies found on board may be smugglers who suffocated. Customs authorities have now dispatched patrol boats to wait outside the Wusongkou to intercept the ship and board it for a search, to prevent any remaining smugglers from escaping after the ship docks.

### Special Criminal Court Trials Thirty Communist Bandits Who Damaged Power Plant, After Interrogation, Returned to Police Department in Original Vehicle

[Our Newspaper Report] The Garrison Headquarters yesterday transferred eleven suspects in the case of the "Six Party" underground paper weaving group, a North Communist group, attempting to sabotage the power company's generators, to the Special Criminal Court for trial. The names of those transferred yesterday were Wang Xiaohe, Wu Guozhen, Wu Shishen, Tan Asi, Song Changgeng, Tang Lansheng, Feng Renzhong, Huang Hongxun, Shi Jingen, Dai Shougen, and Gu Rongsheng, etc., a total of eleven people. Their crime was to put iron filings into the generators of the Yangshupu Power Plant, attempting to cause an explosion, create terror, and put hundreds of thousands of workers out of work, thereby creating chaos. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and no major disaster occurred. After investigation and handling by the Garrison Headquarters, it was discovered that Wang et al. were responsible, and they were arrested. The situation was very tense when the case was transferred to the Special Criminal Court at 3:30 pm yesterday. Wang et al. were all tightly bound with handcuffs and ropes, sitting in a red garrison vehicle, protected by two other red motorcycle carts in front and behind, with soldiers carrying guns and ammunition. Later, because the Special Criminal Court's detention center was already "full," Wang et al. were briefly interrogated and then returned to the Police Department in the original vehicle.

In addition, two other suspects in the case, Zhang Shibao and Chen Longgen, were transferred to the Special Criminal Court by the Garrison Department last night, briefly interrogated, and then returned to the Garrison Department.

### Jiaoren Wheel Leaves for Tianjin, Fugitive Hidden on Board, Military Authorities Dispatch Boat in Pursuit

[Our Newspaper Report] When the China Merchants Bureau's "Jiaoren" wheel left Shanghai from the No. 12 and 13 pontoons in Nanshi at 1:00 pm yesterday to sail to Tianjin, a certain military agency in this city suddenly received information that an important Communist Party member was hidden on board, intending to go to Tianjin for activities. After requesting instructions from superiors, they immediately dispatched officers to go. At that time, the wheel had already sailed for about half an hour, so they coordinated with the China Merchants Bureau's police department and dispatched a speedboat to pursue it. At 2:30 pm, it was intercepted on the Yangshupu River. The wheel was ordered to stop, and a comprehensive search was carried out on board, which lasted until around 4:00 pm. The results were not disclosed by personnel from a certain military agency. However, it is known that the fugitive's surname is Lin, and he was newly sent from Hong Kong to North China to engage in activities.

### National Bank Does Not Provide Loans for Foreign Exchange Settlement of Public Utilities

[Our Newspaper Report] In order to seek indirect subsidies for the implementation of public utilities in this city, the municipal government consulted with the Central Bank to provide low-interest loans, so that various public utility companies could settle foreign exchange in advance and purchase coal for the next month's allocation.

In addition, the municipal government has submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to maintain the April tax rate in order to reduce the cost of public utilities. As for whether the new prices for the eight major public utilities in this city in May should still apply the automatic adjustment method for public utility prices, the central government has not given any instructions.

### Municipal Government Asks China Merchants Bureau to Send Ships to Qinhuangdao to Load Coal

[Our Newspaper Report] Regarding the supply of coal in this city, the municipal government has reached an agreement with the Fuel Management Committee, that the municipal government will dispatch ships to Qinhuangdao to load and transport it to Shanghai. In terms of price, if the coal is loaded and arrives before the end of this month, it will be settled at the April price; otherwise, it must be calculated after the new price for May is determined. Now the municipal government has asked the China Merchants Bureau to send two ships to rush to the area to load the coal. It is expected that at least a portion of it can be transported within this month. However, the total transport capacity of the two ships from the China Merchants Bureau is only 20,000 tons, while the city's coal consumption is 40,000 tons per month. The city can try to raise 10,000 tons, but it is still short of 10,000 tons of coal, and the source of that is uncertain.

### Poor Sales of Registered Household Rice Due to Inferior Quality of US Rice

[Our Newspaper Report] According to the Public Opinion Survey Association, the amount of relief rice sold in this city in April was about 50% less than in March. There are two reasons for this: (1) Two-thirds of the relief rice supplied to the market in April was American rice, and only 70,000 to 80,000 bags were domestic rice. The American rice was of inferior quality and did not suit the taste of the citizens, so sales of registered household rice were sluggish. (2) The market price and the ration price were not very different. The authorities have not dumped much rice, but have been able to stabilize market prices. They have now decided to continue to do so for three months. From next month, American rice will still be the main component of the rationed rice, supplemented by domestic rice, and there will be no problem with the source.

### The Case of Zeng Dechong's Suicide in Beiping Due to Love Lost, The Female Protagonist in Shanghai Prepares to Marry, Talking Freely About the Twists and Turns of Their Acquaintance

[Our Newspaper Report] The circumstances surrounding the suicide of Zeng Dechong, the director of the Beiping Police Bureau's confidential office, due to love lost, are quite complex. The female protagonist in the case, Fang Yixian, is currently residing at No. 8, Ai New Village, Yuqing Road, Shanghai. When reporters visited yesterday, her fiancé, lawyer Luo Cunbin, was also present. According to Fang, she met the deceased Zeng Dechong as early as 1939, during the early days of the Anti-Japanese War. Fang was only seventeen years old at the time, and motivated by the national crisis, she joined the Political Department of the 176th Division of the Fifth War Zone to engage in propaganda work for the Anti-Japanese War. The deceased was the director of the Political Department at the time, and her direct superior. Fang, with her beautiful appearance, had no shortage of colleagues pursuing her, and Director Zeng Dechong was one of the most ardent pursuers. Fang, in this situation, found it difficult to cope with.

Schemed and Lost Her Virginity, Desperate and Furious

Later, Zeng used his power to falsely accuse Fang of impure thoughts and imprisoned her. In the spring of 1940, when the war was raging in the Dabie Mountains, Zeng Dechong designed to have Fang released from prison at a friend's house in Wangjiachong, and after anesthetizing her with narcotics, he raped her. The next morning, Fang discovered that she had lost her virginity, and was desperate and furious. Taking advantage of Zeng's unpreparedness, she obtained his self-defense pistol and fired two shots at him, one of which hit Zeng's arm, causing only minor injuries. She was then disarmed, and no tragedy occurred. Afterwards, Zeng still expressed his love, but Fang hated him deeply and never lessened her hatred.

Soon, this matter spread throughout the army, and there was a lot of talk. Zeng's behavior was soon learned by his superiors, and he was dismissed from his post. Fang, unexpectedly, became pregnant after this terrifying night. In the winter of 1940, she gave birth to a boy, but he died after only four months.

Enemies Meet on a Narrow Road, Heart Cold

As the war situation changed, Fang followed the army to Guilin and worked for the Engineering Committee. Unexpectedly, enemies meet on a narrow road, and she met Zeng again. At this time, Zeng was a consultant to the Guilin Pacification Commissioner's Office and a counselor to the provincial government, but he had not forgotten Fang and often pestered her, but Fang remained cold and distant. At the same time, Fang began to know Luo Cunbin. After talking, Luo expressed great sympathy for her. Over time, pity turned into love, and they finally announced their official engagement. Soon, victory came, and Zeng Dechong, through introductions, went to Ping to serve as the director of the Police Bureau's confidential office, while Luo Cunbin soon came to Shanghai. Fang then followed him south, and the two once returned to Fang's hometown of Anqing. During this time, Fang often corresponded with the deceased's family. The deceased was from Guilin, Guangxi, and his brothers Zeng Zhiyi and Zeng Yuchun both hold positions in the military, political, educational, and cultural circles of Beiping, and are all people of status. Because Zeng Dechong had repeatedly told his family about Fang's past, they were very concerned about her. Although his brothers and sisters repeatedly advised him, Zeng Dechong remained obstinate.

Remained Obstinate and Staged a Tragedy

Later, Fang, in preparation for her marriage to Luo, once went to Beiping at the request of the deceased's family to sign a document with Zeng Dechong, stating that they would break off all relations from then on, so as to avoid any further troubles. However, the deceased stubbornly refused. Fang could not wait any longer and left Ping to go south on the 2nd of the month. When the news that she was preparing to formally marry Luo recently spread, Zeng Dechong knew that the matter was hopeless, and out of resentment, he ultimately staged this tragic suicide.

### Reorganization of Industrial Trade Associations Decided to Proceed According to Original Steps, Standards for Membership Eligibility Have Been Relaxed

[Our Newspaper Report] Regarding the reorganization of various industrial trade associations in this city, Wang Jiashu, director of the Second Bureau of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters: Since the Industrial Association Law was promulgated, the Social Affairs Bureau, under the orders of the Ministry of Social Affairs, has been guiding important industrial trade associations and municipal industrial trade associations to reorganize in accordance with the new law. Meetings were convened separately to instruct on the matters to be carried out. At that time, the most difficult problem for each association was that the membership qualifications had to be in accordance with the draft Factory Law, requiring that they have machines and normally employ more than 30 workers, or not have machines and normally employ more than 60 workers. If this standard were strictly enforced, all small factories that did not meet the above conditions would have to withdraw from the existing associations, which would cause widespread difficulties for each association. The Social Affairs Bureau has reported the actual situation of industry in this city to the Ministry of Social Affairs, requesting that the standards be relaxed and that factories that do not meet the standards but have already joined the associations be allowed to register as members. This point has been approved by the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Ministry of Economics, so the reorganization work can proceed smoothly. Currently, about one-third of the associations have scheduled reorganization meetings, and it is expected that all will be reorganized by mid-May at the latest. Rumors that the reorganization of industrial associations will be postponed before the Commercial Association Law is amended, and that some industrial associations in this city have requested that the reorganization deadline be extended to October, the Social Affairs Bureau has not received any new instructions from the Ministry of Social Affairs. The reorganization work of each industrial association will still proceed according to the original steps. All reorganization procedures and precautions should be based on the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Social Affairs Bureau, and the methods set by any other organization have no decisive effect.

However, there were already more than 500 refugees stationed in various rooms, and the security police were stationed in the hall. After receiving the report, the Social Affairs Bureau urgently sent personnel to investigate the number of refugees and strive to provide relief and resettlement. It is understood that the refugees had automatically moved out by around 9:00 pm.

### Trial Opens in Lunacy Mystery Case: Is Yan Peixing Mentally Ill? Two Doctors Offer Conflicting Diagnoses; Further Expert Determination Pending Before Resumption of Hearing

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In the "Lunacy Mystery" case, concerning Yuan Baoying's accusation that Yan Peixing is mentally ill and requesting a judgment of interdiction, presiding Judge He Xianzhang of the Seventh Civil Court conducted an inquiry yesterday morning. Dr. Han Fen, the head of the Neuropsychiatry Department at the Public Concession Hospital, and Dr. Huang Yingbang, the head of the Puji Hospital, testified. First, Australian Dr. Han Fen testified: "I diagnosed Yan on April 5th, 6th, and 7th, and listened to the statements of his relatives and friends. From beginning to end, I did not find any signs of mental illness. On April 18th, I jointly diagnosed him with Professor Weissbrodt, a psychology professor at Shanghai University. According to the professor's conclusion, no signs of any pathological symptoms in Yan's brain tissue could be found. However, based on Yan's past behavior, it can be determined that he is a person with an inferiority complex. Because of this 'inferiority complex,' he often seeks to gain power and be respected by others. This is a form of escape from an unpleasant reality. People with inferiority complexes often exaggerate their actions, and some of his absurd notes can be explained by this."

Subsequently, Dr. Huang Yingbang testified. Due to illness, he was permitted by the court to answer questions while seated: "Yan Peixing was brought to the hospital for treatment by Yuan Baoying around 5:00 PM on February 9th of this year. The patient's condition upon entering the hospital can be divided into three phases:

Phase 1: Excitement, restlessness, insomnia, and grandiose thoughts; Phase 2: Gradually becoming quiet, sometimes excited, sometimes dull, taciturn, and improved sleep; Phase 3: Quiet, without grandiose language. The conclusions based on the examination are: (1) Not cerebral syphilis; (2) Possibly periodic paranoid psychosis, but this condition is difficult to determine in a short period; (3) The symptoms during hospitalization were initially excitement and grandiosity, followed by slight depression; (4) All of the above phenomena may be an occasional mental disorder reaction in people who are extremely sensitive to emotions, mentally unbalanced, and unable to control themselves when subjected to temporary stimulation."

Defendant Yan Peixing, in addition to submitting a written defense in court stating that he had no mental illness, also presented a copy of the factory's meeting minutes from April 22nd to prove that he was capable of handling affairs. He also pointed out in court that Dr. Huang had demanded 1 billion yuan from him, saying that he would be released from the hospital if he had the money. However, the court did not investigate this matter. Subsequently, Yan's lawyer stood up and argued: "According to Article 14 of the Civil Code, it refers to a continuous mental illness state, which is not consistent with the defendant's situation. Moreover, the evidence presented by the plaintiff is all old evidence. We request the court to reject the plaintiff's claim."

Finally, Judge He declared: "If the evidence in this case is complete, a ruling will be made directly. However, there are still questions that need to be resolved by a well-known domestic psychiatrist. Dr. Han Fen is a foreign doctor, and there may be inaccuracies due to repeated translations. Therefore, we must wait for a re-diagnosis before scheduling another hearing."

### Distant Recipient of Charity Housing: Resident of Guiyang Writes to Register

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Yesterday, a recipient of Type A charity housing in our city, currently residing far away in Guiyang, wrote to the Winter Relief Association to register. The person's name is Yu Yiyan, and the number is Han Zi 04699. It is stated that because he is far away in Guiyang, he cannot rush to Shanghai to register. He is currently preparing to resign from his current position in June, raise travel expenses, and bring his family to Shanghai to complete the housing acquisition procedures. After completing the procedures, he plans to move to Shanghai and seek another job. However, according to the person in charge of the Winter Relief Association, registration by letter from lottery winners cannot be considered official registration because it is based on mere words without proof. It can only be tentatively filed for record. It is still hoped that the winner will bring the lottery ticket to register in person.

### Ballad Singer Zhou Xiaochun Arrested for Seduction

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Zhou Xiaochun, a famous ballad singer, 46 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 1, Lane 23, Chongqing Middle Road, in October of the 35th year of the Republic, had his niece, Pan Quanying (currently 16 years old, from Suzhou), introduced by a colleague, Pan Boying, to study with Zhou as her teacher. In July of last year, the teacher took her to Wuzhen, Zhejiang, to perform ballads, and they slept in the same room at night, resulting in a relationship. She became secretly pregnant. A few days ago, the teacher and student returned to Shanghai together. Quanying's mother (residing upstairs at Huiquan Lou Bookstore on Fujian Road), seeing the situation, questioned her strictly. The daughter finally revealed everything. Last night around 10 PM, she reported to the Lao Zha Police Station, which transferred the case to the Songshan Branch. Officers were dispatched to Zhou's residence on Chongqing Road and arrested him, taking him to the station and accusing him of seducing a girl under the age of 16. He is scheduled to be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office today for investigation.

### Dade, After Visiting Our Textile Mill, Believes Management Efficiency is Very High

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Dade, the leader of the Allied Textile Group, arrived in Shanghai on the 24th and has been visiting major textile mills in the city for several days, and has also been consulting with the Yarn Control Committee. Dade told reporters yesterday: "From observing the products of Chinese textile factories, it is clear that the management efficiency is very high and the management is excellent. The supply of cotton from US aid, amounting to 150 million US dollars, is a great help to the Chinese textile industry. Because of the implementation of the Marshall Plan, Europe will obtain American cotton worth over 500 million US dollars. Therefore, it will be difficult to purchase on the American market due to this huge need. I hope that after China obtains this supply, it can be distributed in the fairest and most reasonable way according to the production situation of each factory. The Allied Forces hope that the Japanese textile industry can start operating at 4 million spindles. However, in the next few years, Chinese textile products will be used to meet their own needs, so there will be no sharp competition with Japan."

### Abdominal Pain and Vomiting After Eating Vegetarian Food; Testing of Raw Oil Shows No Toxic Substances

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Chen Zizhan, the manager of Jinxiang Yarn Company in this city, and his relatives and friends all experienced abdominal pain and vomiting after eating vegetarian food at Lingyan Temple on Lingyan Mountain in Suzhou on the 25th. They recovered after one or two days. Mr. Chen has now returned to Shanghai. He said that on the day they ate vegetarian food at Lingyan Temple, the monks, fearing that people from Shanghai were not used to eating soybean oil and rapeseed oil, specially went to a nearby oil shop to buy raw oil for cooking. Unexpectedly, after eating, everyone experienced abdominal pain and vomiting one after another. Fortunately, everyone was unharmed and gradually recovered. A small amount of the remaining raw oil has now been brought to Shanghai and sent to a doctor at the Third Municipal Hospital for testing. It was found that there were no toxic substances in it, but it had impurities with the smell of tung oil. Therefore, the reason is that the raw oil contained tung oil. It is also heard that Mr. Chen invited relatives and friends to Lingyan Mountain this time to hold a cremation ceremony for his deceased mother. After this incident, local superstitious people have spread various rumors.

According to a letter from Lingyan Temple to this newspaper: Chen Zizhan held a banquet in the mountains. The cook used was hired by Mr. Chen from Shanghai. At that time, because the temple's soybean oil and rapeseed oil were not to his taste, he temporarily purchased 20 jin of white raw oil from a Wanjianqiao oil shop in Suzhou. It was past noon when it arrived at the mountain, so the cook began cooking in a hurry. After the meal, some of the guests did vomit, but all 200 of the temple's monks were safe and sound.

### This Year's Required Tea Loan Funds: China Farmers Bank Has Separately Allocated; Tea Merchants' Request for Increase May Be Difficult to Fulfill

This year's tea loan will be issued by the China Farmers Bank. Zhou Mengxin, the director of the bank's business department, came to Shanghai a few days ago to discuss the allocation of funds with the Central Bank. The Farmers Bank has allocated the loan amounts for processing, transportation, and collateral in each production area within the total of 849 billion yuan approved by the Joint Treasury. Yesterday, it was approved by President Liu of the Central Bank, and it can be allocated separately today. According to Zhou, the government's tea loan program over the years has been aimed at encouraging exports and earning foreign exchange by providing low-interest funds. The 849 billion yuan approved by the Joint Treasury this year represents the government's greatest effort. This loan is issued in three phases. The first phase is for processing loans, the second phase is for boxed tea transportation loans, and the third phase is for export boxed tea collateral loans. During the boxed tea transportation loan phase, the processing loan is deducted. During the export boxed tea collateral loan phase, the transportation loan is deducted. Tea merchants can use this loan in a cyclical manner, which is of great help to them. It is also learned that tea merchants believe that the tea loan figures approved by the Joint Treasury are too small and the loan period is too short. They hope that the government will increase it and will formally make a request. However, according to relevant sources, the government does not intend to consider this.

### Chinese Stocks Continue to Weaken; Market Transactions are Sluggish

Chinese stocks weakened further yesterday due to the continuing Vice Presidential election and flat materials market. Interest among industry insiders also waned, and stocks continued to decline with sluggish transactions. Only Yong Yarn had a final struggle near closing.

The morning began with uncertainty. Yong Yarn opened lower at 2,025 yuan, rose to 2,035 yuan after opening. With no changes in foreign exchange rates, No. 102 and others sold off, falling below the 2,000 yuan mark. However, credit was very loose, and agency fees also opened lower at 16 yuan and 19 yuan. There was a slight rebound, rising to 2,025 yuan, but with no new buyers, the floating long positions collapsed first after 11:30, falling to 1,979 yuan. At noon, the market was forced down to 1,983 yuan. With the Vice Presidential election resuming and various materials rebounding, sentiment in the stock market became even more unsustainable. Compared to the previous close, Zhongfa, Zhabei, Xinhua, Jinglun, Xinyi, and Huaxin all fell by half a percent, and the remaining stocks all fell slightly.

In the afternoon, the market opened at 1,995 yuan. With the National Bank entering the market, it rebounded to 2,030 yuan. Near closing, Nos. 197 and 145 raised the price to 2,035 yuan, closing at 2,030 yuan. Compared to the morning close, Lian'an National Goods remained flat, while the remaining stocks all rose slightly. Various unlisted stocks outside the market were mediocre and slightly declined.

Foreign stocks saw both gains and losses yesterday. Inventory was limited, making it easier to rise than fall. Yisha opened at 3.19 million, falling from 3.23 million to 3.16 million. Near closing, it easily rebounded to 3.23 million to end the day. Trading volume was not high, and supply was limited. As a result, compared to the previous close, British Union, Jardine Matheson, Wheelock, Steel, and Paperboard all fell slightly, while Yisha, Yeguang, and Aviation rose slightly. Yipi and Shipping remained flat.

Government bonds continued to flourish yesterday, with a trading volume of approximately 5 million. Tong Bing opened at 120,000 yuan, rising from 122,000 to 239,000 to end the day. Compared to the previous close, Types Jia, Yi, Ding each rose by 12,000, Type Bing rose by 16,000, and Type Wu rose by 15,000.

### Trade Association Announces Registered Amounts for Imported Materials with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to Hua Hongtao, a representative of the Import and Export Association, there are slight discrepancies in the reported registered amounts for imported materials with self-provided foreign exchange. He stated that the total number registered with the Import Control Committee previously was 46 million US dollars, of which 35 million US dollars were shipped to Shanghai after removing those that were unloaded halfway. To date, approximately 1,670 applications, totaling 28 million US dollars, have been submitted to the China Trust Bureau for purchase. Among them, approximately 1,480 applications, totaling 21 million US dollars, have been allocated by the China Trust Bureau, meaning the foreign exchange has been settled.

Also, at the Import and Export Trade Association meeting held the afternoon before yesterday, the following matters were reported: The method of dividing foreign currency deposit slips will be based on the previously decided method, dividing into two phases, with one slip expiring each month. It is heard that the government is rushing to process these foreign currency deposit slips and they will be issued soon. The 1/10th legal profit given by the government for purchasing goods with self-provided foreign exchange can be issued at the same time as the foreign currency deposit slips. Regarding the issue of using foreign currency deposit slips for deductions, the import and export industry hopes to be able to deduct them simultaneously in the import quotas for the fourth and fifth quarters.

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Transactions are Sluggish

The cotton yarn market yesterday was sluggish because it was the period for the textile construction allocation, with a large number of quotas. Merchants in this street were slow to accept, and out-of-town purchases were also light, leading to a softening market atmosphere. The opening and closing prices of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn were both 233 million yuan, down 2 million from the previous day. Shuiyue and Jincheng also fell by 2-3 million yuan. Although 21-count Double Horse yarn was supported by floating long positions, it ultimately ended 4 million lower at 156 million due to oversupply. The remaining counts of coarse and fine yarns also fell by 1-2 million to 3-4 million yuan.

The cotton cloth market yesterday was characterized by a large supply of the textile construction supply the day before, with ample chips in the market. The number of suppliers was more than the demand, and customer support was declining. Local retail sales were also weak. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth went from 5,034,000 yuan all the way down to 4,980,000 yuan at closing, a small drop of 70,000 yuan from the previous day. Wufu Caiqiu, Blue Chicken, and other fine cloths also fell by 40,000-50,000 to 80,000 yuan. Other cloths were weak, but Shirting remained stable.

Also, the initial purchase price for Blue Chicken fine cloth supplied by the textile construction company was broken even, and in the middle of the process it was sold at a loss of 10,000-20,000, and finally at a loss of 30,000 yuan, opening at 4,530,000 yuan. Laba Tong fine cloth was sold at 4,640,000, 3A Caiqiu at 4,470,000, and Si Junzi, Yuan Biji, and Poplin were all sold at a loss of 50,000-60,000 yuan. Poplin was priced at 5,600,000 yuan.

The spot cotton market was flat yesterday, with sparse transactions. However, the prices in the producing areas have been rising sharply recently. Cotton merchants do not have much inventory on hand, and once they sell it, they will suffer a loss when hedging, so the supply is scarce, and transactions are only with a few customer peddlers, squeezing on credit. Jingyang was sold for 25 million, Zhengzhou for 25.3 million, Hankou mixed fine for 20 million, Huo Ji for 19.5 million, 20 million, and Zhoupu seed cotton for 5.06 million to 5.08 million.

### Grains, Edible Oils, and Bean Cakes All Decline

Yesterday, the rice market fell again due to sluggish actual sales. The price of tin turned flat the day before, and sentiment became depressed.

Salt is currently one of the most needed commodities in Japan, but China has stopped exporting it for a long time due to price issues.

### Talented People from All Directions Gather in Shanghai; Countless Athletes Descend from the Sky; Reporters are Overwhelmed; Guangdong Athletes are Freezing

[Our Newspaper's Report] Starting at 12:30 pm yesterday, reporters waited at Longhua Airport for six hours. The delegations from all over the country participating in the National Games arrived one after another, six or seven units. Aircraft from China National Aviation Corporation, Central Air Transport Corporation, Pan American, French Airlines, etc., landed from the sky every moment or half hour, causing a group of reporters to run around the field, busy with welcoming interviews and photography. The airport's material inspectors shouted that they were endlessly troubled!

At one o'clock, the overseas Chinese delegation from Saigon, Vietnam, was the first to land on a French airline plane. A total of 28 people came (nine of whom were members of the sightseeing group.) There was also an honorary leader, Yin Fengzao, who is our consul general in Saigon, who flew to Nanjing as early as the 23rd. All team members wore uniformly khaki-colored puffy suits, with the team emblem embroidered on the pocket in the shape of a golden harvest, which was exceptionally beautiful.

Cui Xiaoran, secretary of the Saigon team, is a reporter for the Saigon Far East Daily. He said: This is the first time that Saigon overseas Chinese have sent representatives to participate in the motherland's National Games. The team's expenses were fully raised by local overseas Chinese businessmen for 220,000 Vietnamese dong. The budget for each of the 22 team members is 10,000 yuan. Their beautiful suits cost 1,500 Vietnamese dong each.

They participated in three events: basketball, track and field, and table tennis. It is said that Bi Hong, a member of the track and field team, has a 100-meter result of 11.2 seconds. The 400-meter relay also has a result of 46.1 seconds.

At 1:20 pm, China National Aviation Corporation brought five representatives from Shaanxi Province from Xi'an, all in khaki national uniforms and military boots. Team Leader Li Jingyao is an inspector of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education. The team members' actions, posture, and humor were in stark contrast to those of the Saigon team members.

The Sichuan Province delegation also arrived on a Central Air Transport Corporation plane at 3:40 pm. The team of 25 people includes four female team members. Everyone wore dark blue serge jackets, with yellow silk trim along the collar, and white canvas trousers. The colors were very bright. When everyone got off the plane, they all carried a small jar of chili peppers in their hands. The sound of "yaode" (meaning "good" in Sichuan dialect) was endless, showing the true colors of Sichuan.

There were 32 members in the second batch of representatives from Guangdong and Guangzhou, but female softball players accounted for 13 of them. The team members' clothes were colorful, like a motley army. Many team members wore summer clothes and could not help but shiver after getting off the plane. Several representatives selected from Pui Ying wore a complete set of beige valitin new suits, which attracted attention.

### American World Games Basketball Team, Fourteen Tall People, Center Seven Feet Tall

### Fudan University Issues Announcement, Instructing Students on Four Points

Explaining the Search Incident

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Office of the President of Fudan University issued an announcement yesterday, which was more than a thousand words long, instructing students on four points: (1) The university's consistent aim has been to care for and guide students. When unexpected events occur, the university will definitely fulfill its responsibility to protect them. Therefore, after the university was searched by unidentified persons this time, the university immediately made repeated requests to the municipal government, both verbally and in writing, to strictly investigate and deal with the matter. The municipal government has also promised to investigate. However, student groups of the university should apply to the Department of Student Affairs for meetings held on campus in accordance with the regulations. The three music groups, such as the Muse Society, held meetings automatically in Hanyuan, which was not in accordance with the regulations. The address of Hanyuan is next to Guoquan Road, which is not within the scope of the university, and the nearby shops, residents, and air force barracks are not owned by the university and cannot be regarded as within the campus. This time, the Muse Society and other groups held meetings outside the campus without authorization, which attracted the attention of outsiders. They should be more vigilant in the future. (2) As for student dormitories, they should not be illegally invaded by others. It is heard that after the search in Hanyuan on that day, unidentified persons broke into Yang Sheng Guichang's dormitory to search. If this is true, the university will definitely raise a more serious protest. However, up to now, it is only based on hearsay, and no one has come forward to prove it. If solid evidence can be provided, it will be easier for the university to conduct negotiations and obtain results. (3) The organization of the so-called Departmental Joint Association is not legally based, and the so-called "Human Rights Protection Association" is also not within the scope of campus activities. The procedures for its establishment are even more problematic. These two groups should be banned immediately. In the future, anyone who uses the name of these two groups to conduct any activities on campus will be punished. (4) The university cannot change the student union charter issued by the Ministry of Education. Since the Ministry's order does not allow for any changes, if * the Ministry's military establishes a student union, the university can allow it to proceed with the organization at any time.

### Students from the Marine Group of Fudan University Go to Taihu Lake in Wuxi to Practice Limnology

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Marine Group of the College of Science of National Fudan University is scheduled to go to Taihu Lake in Wuxi on the 28th of this month to practice limnology, guided and researched by Professor Qu Zhonghu of the program. Several students who have selected Professor Qu's course on Ecology are also participating in the work. It is heard that the group has contacted Jiangnan University and made arrangements to stay at the school to save time and increase work efficiency. It is heard that the scope of this research includes (1) the physical and chemical properties of inland water; (2) the collection of plankton; (3) the collection of aquatic organisms; (4) the study of limnological topography; (5) the study of limnological biological production, etc.

### Children's Music, Centralized Training, Experts Praise "Song of the Morning Bell"

[Report from our newspaper] The city's children's music concert's chorus "Song of the Morning Bell" recently underwent centralized training at five district and one central school. In addition to over five hundred instructors and students from various schools participating, experts such as Pan Boying also came to provide guidance. After the training, a discussion was held, starting with Director Zhu Junti reporting the purpose of holding the children's music concert. Subsequently, Lu Guanliu and Xu Xiyi, the authors of "Song of the Morning Bell," explained the content of the lyrics and music and the key points of the production. Experts Dai Cuilun, Wang Yungong, Xiong Foxi, Li Jianwu, Du Zuozhou, Huang Xincun, and others expressed their opinions, all agreeing that "Song of the Morning Bell" is a good song. Finally, Director Li Ximou expressed deep gratitude for the enthusiastic guidance of the experts, saying that school education should not be limited to textbook teaching within the classroom but should pay attention to social, drama, and music activities. The educational value of these activities has already been valued by the United Kingdom and the United States. The bureau's promotion of music education is also in line with this goal.

### National Basic Education Exhibition Requires Approximately 10 Billion [Currency Unit]

### "Science and Politics"

— Yang Shi

("Science and Politics," By Prof. A.D. Ritchie, Oxford University Press, London, 1947)

The rapid progress of science and the crisis in politics, the result of their incompatibility, is the very difficult and urgent problem that the world faces today. Hatred and alienation are increasing day by day; the crisis and chaos are deepening, making us feel that mankind has thrown itself into an abyss of problems that are almost impossible to solve. More dangerous than in 1914, people are again beginning to have the terrible idea of "eliminating war with war." Two or three years after the end of a decade of massacres, we really cannot stand these nervous stimulations anymore. But this is the problem; wise people cannot close their eyes and let those political contenders blunder blindly. Once a disaster occurs, no one can stop it. On the contrary, they must face it squarely and try to use their wisdom to find the safest path for mankind.

Professor A.D. Ritchie of Durham University in England discusses these urgent problems extensively in his recent book "Science and Politics." The original text is compiled from the lectures given at the university's "Riddle Memorial Lectures," so it still appears clear and accessible. His topic is not limited to the "control of the atomic bomb," but broadly discusses what important role science (including scientists) plays in this world, and what significant impacts they have in a country; and proposes the new significance of science in politics.

The cultural development of mankind to this day has made science and politics closely intertwined. It is almost impossible to talk about science alone; therefore, Professor Ritchie discusses them together. Consider that a country can use the great power of science to increase human happiness, or it can destroy humanity entirely. Therefore, some wise people standing outside the situation (including those outside scientists who only pursue truth and do not consider the consequences, burying themselves in the laboratory all day long) feel confused and indignant. A calm scientist, out of a sense of moral responsibility, must be alarmed and must imagine how many terrible messes these politicians who have not received a good scientific education will make after holding the power to use science.

The author himself admits that he is dreaming a beautiful dream. He hopes that political power and the ability to choose science are in the same hand, meaning that the highest ruling power of the country should be given to scientists. He said, "Scientists have the power to destroy the world, and they will have the power to save the world."

However, science and politics are an uncompromising pair of enemies. A first-class scientist cannot maintain his noble position in science if he wants to live a completely political life, due to the rapid progress of science, and even more because politics is a job that requires the entire time. It is almost impossible for a scientist to engage in successful political activities at the same time. Professor Ritchie said, "Our so-called political activities are by no means just attending a few parliamentary debates, occupying a few ministerial positions, or being a member of a royal advisory committee." Due to the expansion of national power in modern times, an active politician must devote all his energy to dealing with all the problems he encounters; therefore, he cannot engage in another kind of affair. There are many such examples in the United Kingdom. Often, the representatives elected by university constituencies are mostly uninvolved and only hold a nominal title. Readers may think that this is only a phenomenon in Western democratic countries (referring to England and France), but the author said, "Whether it is an Eastern democratic country (referring to the Soviet Union) or a Western democratic country, it is the same. The question is whether scientists are willing to abandon their superior position in science and pursue political power that they are not interested in."

The author seems to be talking about a dream that is not easy to realize, so he proposes another way to effectively express the political views of scientists, which is to increase their seats in parliament, recommend outstanding scientists as senators, and give special attention to the expression of political views by institutions such as the Royal Society. But even so, there are still difficulties. One of the difficulties is whether political leaders will cooperate with them obediently. Therefore, he turned to political leaders to persuade them.

### Alternating Current Circuits by Sa Bendong

— Shi E

(Ministry-approved university textbook, published by Zhengzhong Book Company, priced at fourteen [currency unit])

Among various engineering fields, electrical engineering is more difficult to study, because what it explores always includes the relationship between time and space. It changes in an instant, and when circuit networks are interconnected, mutual induction occurs, making the problem more complicated. Therefore, we must rely on physical phenomena to distinguish the essence of its nature on the one hand, and apply advanced mathematical principles to deduce its quantity on the other. It is quite difficult for beginners to achieve this in one step. Among them, the course of alternating current circuits is a necessary step for those who study electrical engineering, and it is also the most important required course for the electrical engineering department. Without sufficient preparation in advance, it will be difficult to study power or telecommunications engineering itself, and there will be difficulties that cannot be dealt with. It is a pity that such books are not yet available in China, and we have to rely on European and American works, which is regrettable.

Recently, Zhengzhong Book Company has published a book on alternating current circuits, which is a great celebration for the engineering community in China today. The book is an elaborately crafted masterpiece by Mr. Sa Bendong, a Chinese authority on physics. The entire book progresses from the shallow to the deep, and the explanations are detailed and clear. It can be read smoothly without the need for advanced mathematics. Moreover, the writing style is lively and fluent, and reading it does not give people the dry feeling of ordinary science books. In particular, the method of using complex numbers to express alternating current potential, current, and power has unique advantages.

The content of the book begins with complex numbers in the first chapter, discussing in detail the methods of their calculation and application. The second chapter describes sinusoidal potential and current, deducing the main formulas, giving readers a clear basic concept. Chapters three to five describe the complex value significance of the main constants in the circuit, such as impedance admittance, etc. The application of complex value calculation for electric power is discussed in a special chapter, which is very detailed. Starting from chapter six, more complex problems are discussed. First, the mutual transformation and calculation of equivalent circuits and their applications are described. Chapter seven describes mutual inductance and transformers, so that readers can first have a full understanding of the basic principles of AC motors. Chapter eight describes the transient state of the circuit, starting from the initial differential equations, first DC, then AC, and finally discussing complex composite circuits, from simple to iron, so that readers can compare before and after, which is convenient for recollection. Chapter nine describes the balance, transmission, and power measurement of multi-phase systems. The last chapter describes harmonics, detailing how to decompose a periodic waveform into multiple sinusoidal forms, and then discusses the various effects of non-sinusoidal waves and various analysis methods of harmonics.

Writing a book is difficult, and proofreading is not easy. This is generally recognized by the experienced publishing industry. The various symbols used in the book are various, and each has a special meaning. A slight difference can often lose the original meaning. Although the book cannot be completely free of errors, it is truly commendable in terms of today's domestic publishing standards. Only those who have a thorough research on this subject and rich publishing experience can take on this task.

In summary, this book is a good work on alternating current circuits. Compared with Lawrence Principe of Alternating Currents, a famous American work, it is more suitable as a textbook for universities, because there are more materials and it meets the needs. The attached exercises are convenient for teaching and are especially characteristic.

### Introduction and Review of Xin Jiaxuan's Chronicle

— Chang Mo

Compiled by Deng Guangming, published by Commercial Press

I like Xin Jiaxuan's poems the most. During the Anti-Japanese War, wandering in various regions of the rear area, while traveling through mountains and rivers, while fleeing from enemy air raids and crouching in valleys or by streams and springs, I never forgot to carry Jiaxuan's poems with me. Reading his poems, I can imagine his character: mounting a horse to kill thieves, writing poems after dismounting, passionate and unrestrained. Therefore, I am more willing to know the details of his life's deeds.

In recent years, I have tried to collect and buy some treatises on Jiaxuan, whether they are comments on Jiaxuan's works or narrations of Jiaxuan's life. I have collected more than ten kinds of short articles and monographs, but very few can make me feel satisfied. Last winter, a friend in Peiping bought me a chronicle of Jiaxuan written by Zheng Qian, and I bought a critical biography of Jiaxuan written by Xu Jiarui in Shanghai. After a little reading, I felt even more "worse and worse." This spring, I bought two books newly published by Commercial Press, the chronicle of Jiaxuan written by Mr. Deng Guangming and the "Collection of Xin Jiaxuan's Poems and Essays" compiled and proofread by him. My wish was greatly satisfied. Mr. Deng's two books can almost be said to be "the ultimate" in the search for Xin Jiaxuan's life deeds.

I once read Mr. Deng's "Xin Jiaxuan's Friends" in the first issue of Fudan Journal. He examined that Xin Jiaxuan had as many as 200 friends during his lifetime. I have been admiring the author's ability to collect widely, but in this chronicle of Jiaxuan, the breadth of his investigation of Jiaxuan's life deeds, the number of creations, and the degree of meticulousness and comprehensiveness are far beyond "Examination of Jiaxuan's Friends."

Jiaxuan's poems and essays have been lost for a long time; the Song History biography is not detailed in narration. Therefore, regarding Xin Jiaxuan's life, it is not only difficult to seek some trivial daily routines, but also his "two-point commander, three-drive envoy" (Jiaxuan's self-statement in the girder text of his new residence) in the first half of his life, and his experiences as Fujian Appeasement Envoy, Zhejiang East Appeasement Envoy, and Zhenjiang Prefect in the second half of his life are all important responsibilities on their own. Whether it is for Jiaxuan himself or for the military and political situation at the time, it cannot be regarded as irrelevant, but people who have previously narrated Jiaxuan's life, including Xin Qitai in the middle of the Qing Dynasty and the academic master Liang Qichao in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, have not been able to verify these things clearly. It must be because the books were missing and difficult to engage in, which can be imagined. And in this chronicle of Jiaxuan, Mr. Deng quoted a large number of "Drafts of the Song Hui Yao" compiled by Xu Song and some local chronicles compiled by the Song people, such as Chunxi Sanshan Zhi, Jiading Zhenjiang Zhi, Jingding Jiankang Zhi, Kaiqing Linting Zhi, etc., not only have extremely definite records of Jiaxuan's years of officialdom in various places, but also have extremely detailed explanations of the reasons for each of his transfers and dismissals. The author is at ease, and all the key issues, which have always been controversial and inconsistent, have all been easily resolved.

In addition, some matters that are closely related to Jiaxuan himself, such as Jiaxuan and Dang Huaiying jointly studying with Liu Zhan in Haozhou when they were young, rather than studying with Cai Bojian, this chronicle quotes the small biographies of Dang and Liu in Yuan Yishan's "Zhongzhou Collection," which has definitely proved it; After Jiaxuan returned to the south, he married the daughter of Fan Bangyan, another loyal man who returned to the south, as his wife. This chronicle got a clear answer based on Mu's Lingyang Collection and Liu Zai's Mantang Wenji; Jiaxuan would participate in Cai Guang's affairs with poetry, and found the mother's family of this legend from Chen Mo's Huaigu Lu (in the past, it was all quoted from Xu Qiu's Cihua Congbian); The deep friendship between Jiaxuan and Zhu Xi has found more annotations from the Zhu Zi Yu Lei; Jiaxuan was once deeply involved in the hinterland of the Jin Kingdom when he was young, and he also tried to reconnaissance the military situation of the Jin Kingdom when he guarded the sighing river in his later years. I have also found Jiaxuan's long surprise self-statement in Cheng Bi's Mingshui. There are countless examples like this, all of which are creations in this chronicle.

Strangely, if the above-mentioned issues are what everyone who narrates Jiaxuan's life must examine, then the above-mentioned books should also be what everyone must check, but the fact is that only Mr. Deng has really checked and examined them. For example, the book "Drafts of the Song Hui Yao" was only compiled in the era of Xin Qitai, and has not been printed in the era of Liang Qichao. It is natural that the two authors did not refer to it, but the books of Zheng Qian and Xu Jiarui were recently written, and both of them did not know that there is such a book in the world. Is it strange?

Let me say it again, although Mr. Deng has done his best to collect widely, I can still contribute a supplementary material. In the biographical records of the characters in Yuan Ren Gan Qin's "Qi Cheng", there is a small biography of Jiaxuan, in which there is a sentence "Song people use the words coarse and barren to see it and do not use it", and it is also said that "Song Shi Lu Bi Youan praised Han Du's use of troops, defeated Du, and Youan was guilty of public opinion." These all seem to be worth quoting in Jiaxuan's chronicle. Recently, I saw that Mr. Deng also has articles supplementing Xin's spectrum, I don't know if this article has been added?

### Introducing "Biological Interest"

— Di Shan

(Written by Yao Yuqiu, newly published by Kaiming Bookstore)

Writing texts of scientific interest in a literary style is called "scientific essays," which was first advocated in the "Taibai" semi-monthly magazine founded in 1935. Later, this type of text was gradually loved by readers, and more and more authors were engaged in writing.

Ten years ago, Kaiming Bookstore published Jia Zuzhang's "Biological Sketches," Ke Shi's "Flowers, Birds, Fish," and Tao Bingzhen's "Insect Anecdotes," etc. These collections of "scientific essays" have always been books that readers love to read. In March of this year, Kaiming newly published Yao Yuqiu's "Biological Interest."

This book is included in the "Kaiming Youth Series," and it is a book that uses simple words to express the interest in biological forms, properties, and other aspects.

The book contains a total of 21 articles, 14 of which are related to animal records, and 7 are texts describing plants. In terms of animals, from the extremely small fleas and lice to the huge body of the elephant, each article has newer research. The author's purpose is not only to make readers recognize each animal, but also hopes to arouse interest in studying biology. Therefore, the author's text has been refined.

For example, the beginning of the article "Cuckoo", the author's text is very beautiful:

——Spring is gone, the weather gradually changes from mild to hot, and the earth has also been re-clothed in a set of dark green clothes. In the thick willow, in addition to seeing swallows flying like shuttles from time to time, we can also see a gray-black cuckoo in the forest. It is the messenger of summer, and it has now begun to broadcast its mournful cry to the world.

As in recording the sound of cicadas

——It is sometimes loud and high-pitched, sometimes passionate and clear and secluded, bringing people a feeling of elegance everywhere, and dispelling a lot of sorrow in our hearts.

One of the articles on plants, "Plum", can be said to be pure "prose". When we heard the famous sentence "Dark fragrance floats in the dusk," we could not help but imagine an old and elegant posture from the author's pen.

People who are accustomed to reading textbooks on botany or biology and feel boring, I recommend you to read this "Biological Interest". You will definitely be happy to think that the biological world is so beautiful and lovely!

### Reading "Love of Life and Death"

— Liu Zhao

Written by Lin Shuhua, published by New Century Publishing House

When "Love of Life and Death" was published in the Excellent Couples Monthly on a regular basis, it was titled "Full-length Creation"; but when I finished reading the single book, I only felt that the whole book was more like the author's autobiography than a creative novel.

I don't know if other readers agree with my view after reading this book. And I also have a prejudice, thinking that if you read this book with an autobiographical perspective, readers are more likely to be moved by the plot of the book. Generally speaking, moving readers with the plot is not necessarily the author's greatest success; but I think that the success of every literary work is based on arousing readers' resonance as one of the main conditions; then, the author obtains readers' resonance through the narration of the plot. It is not necessarily a kind of writing skill. On this point, the author, Ms. Lin Shuhua, has been successful.

The entire book of "Love of Life and Death" has a total of twenty-two armies, starting with "Life Experience" and ending with "Eternal Regret". The entire story is about a heroine and a hero falling in love, getting married, starting a family, starting a career, and finally the male protagonist dying of illness and the female protagonist mourning the death. This side writes about the heroine and hero's hard struggle due to the lack of freedom of love under the feudal forces, writes about the heroine's self-sacrifice for the country during the Anti-Japanese War, writes about the hero's courage, integrity, and unremitting efforts, writes about the joy of both parties overcoming difficulties and combining, writes about the hero's dedication to the society and the family, completely forgetting the service spirit of "small self", writes about the heroine inheriting her husband's will after mourning the death, independently supporting the life of the family, and even working as a seamstress, and finally writes about the tragedy of the heroine unfortunately suffering from lung disease and falling into desperation. In all this, the author writes very sincerely, very delicately, and very movingly. I think that after reading this book, every reader will not resonate with the heroine, I am afraid it is extremely rare!

In terms of the narration of the entire story, some people may feel that the author's writing style is very similar to the old-fashioned novels, but in fact the author can jump out of the pattern of vulgar love novels. The author's writing style is fresh and charming. Among the works of female writers I have read, the author has quite a unique style. For example:

"I think of our premarital life: In order to fight for our free life, you have constantly encouraged me and comforted me. We still endured many oppressions from the outside world with tears; we also gritted our teeth and made the greatest struggle with the world; threats and lures, soft deception and coercion; any obstruction could not separate our loving hearts; any blow could not separate our connected feelings. Year after year! Sent away the Mid-Autumn Festival reunion moon, and ushered in the early spring flowers of next year; watched the flowers bloom, and watched the flowers fall…. In the tenth year, we struggled out of the old bound circle and began to fly into our ideal, free world." (Eternal Regret)

Of course, the author's writing style is not without its debatable points. In my opinion, it seems that some places are too procrastinating, and some places have too many exciting words, which is quite suspected of abusing emotions. But according to my guess, the author is probably a passionate woman, then it is no wonder that she unintentionally reveals her emotions everywhere. However, in terms of the work itself, we really have to think that it is a small flaw.

According to the author's preface, the author has only received education that has not yet graduated from middle school; this is quite surprising. Today, the low writing ability of young people has become a recognized fact; but then, with an education that has not yet graduated from middle school, the author can write such a moving autobiography, which is really rare and must be considered a writing genius.

Although, I think that the thing of "genius" should also be appropriately cultivated in today's literary world; if it is blindly praised, the author's genius is very easy to wither immediately. After all, genius is genius, without the addition of hard work and effort, no matter what, it cannot reach the realm of success. Although "Love of Life and Death" is a rare masterpiece, it is still far from the realm of complete success, which is what critics should pay special attention to. Especially the author himself, should also have the same self-awareness, can not think that the existing progress is satisfied, should continue to work hard, continue to improve; do not accept all external criticisms without any opinion, forgetting their own actual ability. This is my most sincere advice to the author.

(Editor's note: Regarding this book, I also received a review from Mr. Yan Yanfang, but because of the limited space, it cannot be published at the same time. I apologize. Mr. Yan encouraged the author and said: "I want to comfort the author: Your life experience is bitter, but there are many people in society who sympathize with you. In the future, I hope you will put the past twelve years behind you and continue to live and strive!"

### Assigned Essay

— Nianhong

Many educators say this: In general, the compositions in elementary and secondary schools are mostly based on teachers predetermining the topics, and then teaching students to expand on the topic. This approach often limits students' thinking, so they cannot write good articles.

I think this statement specifically refers to elementary and secondary school students, and perhaps it is correct, because the thinking of elementary and secondary school students is not yet sound, and they cannot use it freely. Therefore, they have to revolve around the meaning of the topics given by the teachers, and cannot escape their scope. However, if it refers to general writing, then it is not necessarily so. Writing is the expression of thought, and it represents what people think and do. Thought can never be limited by anything, so how can the meaning in writing be blocked by topics? The same target object, with different standpoints, each person has different views. Botanists think of the species when they see a forest; craftsmen think of which are the materials for beams and pillars, and which are not suitable for great purposes; however, in the eyes of poets, it is a great source of material for praising nature.

Of course, topics can limit a part of thought. But the room for maneuvering is still very large, and there are still many articles that can be written, if you are willing to spend some effort to study it. I have heard that once a certain magazine solicited articles with a very strange topic, just the word "one." As a result, among the two excellent works published, one talked about the necessity of the world being one family, and the world being united to eliminate all suspicions among human beings; the other was exactly the opposite. It emphasized individualism, believing that only by taking the individual as the starting point is the shortcut to success. We will not discuss who is writing correctly and who is saying the wrong thing. At least we can see that even extremely strange topics can still be developed to express one's own thoughts and opinions.

A view in society today is that it excessively emphasizes the limiting ability of topics, believing that once the topic is set, all efforts cannot escape its scope, and therefore passively feel that it is a waste of effort, and it is better to let it go. We naturally cannot ignore the big topics. In fact, there are many things that are closely related to it and cannot be solved alone, but it does not mean that there is no way or hope because of it. As long as you do your best, you can still find a way to achieve some success. For example, the person in charge of general organizations always says that the organization cannot exert its effectiveness, which is actually affected by economic difficulties. The economic situation of various organizations is indeed a fatal blow to the development of the cause, but it is not necessarily correct to push all failures to economic problems. In addition to economics, we know that there are still many shortcomings that can be improved, but in fact they have not been improved.

In short, we cannot blame the limitation of the topic and forget our own responsibility. We must know that only when everyone fulfills their responsibilities can we break the limitation of the topic.

### Wang Xiangqi's Handwritten Letter

— Qian Dacheng

I have a letter from the old man Wang Xiangqi, Wang 　Yun, which is not included in the published collections of Wang's letters. It was addressed to my maternal great-grandfather, Zeng Gong Zhuruo (whose given name was Qingpu). The time was the eighteenth day of the sixth lunar month in the first year of the Republic of China (the postal cancellation was August 1st in the Gregorian calendar, still using the Qing Dynasty postal stamps). 　Yun lived in Shantang, Xiangtan, and Zeng Gong lived in Hengzhou. Zeng Gong had served as the prefect of Changsha and Hengzhou, and had often associated with 　Yun. It was repeatedly mentioned in the Xiangqilou Diary. My mother told me: Whenever 　Yun went to the prefect's yamen, the favored Zhou Ma would always follow. 　Yun's braid was thin and small like a spring earthworm. He supported Zhou Ma's shoulder and entered. 　When Yun sat down, Zhou Ma also sat down. His friends laughed and joked with him, but he was not offended. Every time he came, he must ask for snacks, and he would specifically ask for the hand-made snacks of Gong's concubine. This letter was written during the time of change, and Hunan had been restored. There is a saying in the book: "Brother Tan Pi has been out of contact for a long time. Zhou Sheng is the first person to advocate killing him. If he knows that he is in contact with his younger brother, he will definitely pull him into it. ... Yantang will not last long, and your matter will naturally be settled. ... There are many unemployed people everywhere, and there is no reason to let them all freeze and starve to death; leave it to fate, and I really have some insights. At this time, it is not allowed to plan for next year." Tan Shixiong refers to Mr. Tan Yankai, and Zhou Sheng refers to the first Hunan governor, Zhou. Zhou was later killed, and another person was killed after him. The people then supported Mr. Yan Kai to take the lead. At that time, the situation in Hunan was chaotic, and people were panic-stricken. It had entered a state of terror. He firmly declined, but he could not get away, and then he went out of the mountain. His family gathered and cried to send him off. The saying of the melon vines in the letter is not an exaggeration; it is also a last resort to leave it to fate. It also said: "Now everyone regards foreign countries as icebergs, and foreign countries regard themselves as Mount Tai, to reassure the people." Strange words are absurd, and I don't know how to explain them. It also said: "There is nothing to send in the mountains. I have cut more than a hundred melons, but I have not found a good one." Mr. Yang Wuyang please;"Cutting melons, etc., the person holding the knife must be Zhou Ma." This statement is especially comforting. 　Yun has always been known as a master of humor. He was born in times of turmoil and used humor to cover up his endless grief and resentment. His laughter, anger, and scolding all became articles. Tracing its original intention, those who still discuss the ancients should deeply regret it. There are many anecdotes in his life, and many contemporary sages can tell them, so I will not write them here.

### The Zhong Leng Spring of Jinshan

— Shuiqing

Jinshan has the Zhong Leng Spring. The spring water is used to brew tea, which was famous all over the world in the past. This spring is probably located on the south side of Jinshan Mountain, and it is now difficult to find it; as for a well in Jinshan Temple, called "The First Spring in the World," it is definitely not the world-famous Zhong Leng Spring. It is just that the monks use it to pretend to ordinary tourists. It is said that only when truly special guests come, will the abbot be willing to use the real Zhong Leng Spring water to make tea for the guests. The so-called "Tea, brewing tea, brewing good tea, brewing my good tea," (Note) Monks treat guests according to their status.

According to the New Tea Water Record, there is such a story: "During the Daizong Dynasty (Tang Dynasty), Li Xiuqing was sent to Huzhou, and met the recluse Lu Hongjian in Yangzhou. Li had long been familiar with Lu's name, so he went to the prefecture and arrived at the Yangzhou Post Station. He was about to eat, and Li said: 'Mr. Lu is good at tea, and is famous all over the world. Moreover, the Nanling Water (that is, Zhong Leng Spring Water) of Yangzhou is especially wonderful. It is a rare encounter in a thousand years. Can we wait for it?' He ordered the soldiers to carry bottles and boats, and went deep into Nanling. Lu held the utensils and waited for it. Soon the water arrived, and he raised the water with a ladle and said: 'It is the river, but not the Nanling water.' Then he poured it into the basin. When it was half full, Lu suddenly stopped it and said, 'This is the Nanling water.' The soldiers were shocked and knelt down and said: 'I brought it to Nanling, and the boat was swaying and the water was overturned. Fearing that it would be less, I added the water from the bank to it. The recluse is so insightful, how dare I hide it?' This is really a magical thing. No wonder this recluse Lu was honored as the Sage of Tea by later generations. He could even distinguish what kind of water it was after mixing two kinds of water together, and he studied the Zhong Leng Water of Jinshan so thoroughly.

What is the taste of Zhong Leng Spring Water? It is said to be "light, clear, fragrant, and smooth, both sweet and cool"; if it is sweet but not cool, it is definitely not Zhong Leng Spring Water. When Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty toured Jinshan, he once wrote a poem "Trying Zhong Leng Spring" to praise it.

In addition, there is also a magical story in the Taiping Guangji: When Li Deyu was the prime minister in the Tang Dynasty, a good friend was sent on a business trip to Zhenjiang. Li asked him to bring back a bottle of Zhong Leng Spring Water from Jinshan when he returned. The man waited until the day his official business in Zhenjiang was completed, set sail to return, and forgot about it after getting drunk. It was not until the ship arrived in Nanjing that he probably woke up and remembered what the prime minister Li Deyu had asked him to do. However, the ship had arrived in Nanjing, and it was inconvenient to go back, so he took a bottle of water from the Yangtze River in Nanjing, brought it to Chang'an, and gave it to Li Deyu, thinking that he could shirk his responsibility. Unexpectedly, Li Deyu drank the tea made with this water and sighed, "It's quite like the water under the Shicheng in Jianye!" The man couldn't explain it, so he had to thank him. —— Li 　　seems to be very shrewd, he 　can distinguish the taste of the water at the bottom of Zhenjiang and Nanjing, but this also shows how thoroughly they studied the way of drinking tea.

Not to mention that few 　guests know about Zhong Leng Spring Water now, I am afraid that only a few monks in Jinshan Temple know about it, because after a long time, they only know the well of "The First Spring in the World."

(Note) This is the story of Zheng Banqiao's waxing annual righteousness: It is said that when he first traveled in the mountains, the abbot did not know his great name, and only treated him as an ordinary guest. Later, he gradually realized that he was not an ordinary person, and until he knew his great name, he was especially respectful. Therefore, when he was leaving, he gave the abbot a couplet, called "Sit, please sit, please sit up, please Mr. sit up; Tea, brew tea, brew good tea, brew my good tea." It shows that the abbot monk treats guests in four levels.

### The Art of Invisibility

— Fang Ping

When I was young, reading novels of gods and monsters, the most admired and envied thing was the art of invisibility. Using a magic talisman, or chanting a few spells, one can do whatever one wants in front of other people's eyes: kill enemies, take treasures, steal kisses from beautiful women, but others see nothing, and are at a loss. It is truly "wonderful" and "happy." Therefore, when I was young, I often had strange dreams of meeting gods who would teach me the art of invisibility at night. Later, as I grew older, I gradually understood that the so-called "art of invisibility" is just a ridiculous fantasy of novelists, and there is absolutely no one in the world who can hide their physical body. As a result, the golden seal of "art of invisibility" imprinted in my mind when I was young quickly faded.

However, recently I was browsing an English science magazine and accidentally discovered a scientific oddity, saying that the "art of invisibility" has become a true fact. At that time, I was a little surprised, but perhaps because my level of knowledge was higher than before, "doubt" immediately challenged surprise in my heart, so I translated it at will so that people in the scientific community could point out whether it was true or false, possible or impossible. The following is that "oddity":

Italian scientist Professor Mansini has recently invented a light that can hide everything in the human body. It can not only penetrate the muscles of the human body like X-rays, but also further penetrate the bones in the human body. This kind of light, Professor Mansini tentatively named "Mansini Light One."

One day, Professor Sney invited several famous scientists to his home for dinner. Just as the guests were seated one by one, everyone couldn't help but shout out in surprise, because everyone suddenly disappeared the other guests at the table next to them, and felt that they were sitting alone. But in less than three minutes, this strange phenomenon disappeared. The guests were at a loss. It was not until the host said with a smile that he was experimenting with his new invention that everyone suddenly realized. The next day, many newspapers published this "marvel."

According to Professor Mansini, this kind of invisible light is emitted by a radioactive element similar to a spindle. He has done many experiments. The most amazing one was that when the chairs next to the table were clearly visible, the clothes on the chairs suddenly disappeared.

If this "marvel" is indeed a true fact, then when everyone uses "Mansini Light" to steal, commit murder, and even in war, then this world is truly unimaginable.

### Exchanging Calligraphy for Mutton

Calligraphers are paid for their writing, and the remuneration is usually money in modern times. Zheng Banqiao of the Qing Dynasty stipulated that each piece of calligraphy would be paid a certain amount of silver. However, there are also those who do not exchange calligraphy for money, such as Wang Youjun, who wrote the Tao Te Ching for a Taoist priest in Shanyin in exchange for white and lovely geese, which also had its value. During the Song Dynasty, there was a man named Han Zongru, who was an old glutton who loved meat. Every time he obtained a letter from Su Dongpo, he would exchange it for several pounds of mutton to eat. Huang Luzhi jokingly said to Su Dongpo: In the past, Wang Youjun's calligraphy was called "model for rubbing," but now Zongru exchanges your calligraphy for mutton, so your calligraphy can be called "Exchanging Calligraphy for Mutton." One day, Su Dongpo was in the Hanlin Academy, busy writing, when Zong Jiao sent a brief letter, intending to repay him, hoping to get a reply from Su Dongpo. The messenger urged him very urgently. Su Dongpo smiled and said, "Tell the official that today is a day of no slaughter." Su Dongpo's humor can be passed down. (Xiaopeng)

### Small Raindrops

— Shi Jimi

Every young man is a poet. After growing up, "experience" teaches him to become an actor.

A glimmer of fire in the darkness is good, but if you light a lamp in broad daylight, don't you think it's strange?

Life is a cup of bitter tea. Those who only know how to drink milk are not worthy of appreciating this incredible taste.

Only the moon in the night is round. The crescent moon on the third or fourth day is certainly not round, and neither is the moon on the fourteenth or sixteenth day.

Those who cannot forget hatred must also remember kindness. Without barbaric hatred, how can there be passionate love?

A stone thrown into the water only creates one ripple.

### Anecdotes of Sa Zhenbing

— Ziruo

My father, a veteran of the navy, has been taught by Sa Zhenbing for many years, and has a lot of sincere feelings about past events. Therefore, I record them to fill the free talk. My father said, "When Sa was the captain of a merchant ship, I was only in my early twenties. It has been more than forty years since then. During this long period, I have met countless teachers, elders, and officials, but most of them were just teachers, elders, and officials. But when I occasionally think of Teacher Sa, I immediately see a kind and friendly old man in front of me. I don't know why this is the case, but I reflect on myself and feel that I dare not lightly overstep the norms in terms of my behavior, speech, and actions. I feel that I am influenced by Teacher Sa. In peacetime, I once privately tried to evaluate him, and the most fashionable word now is democracy. Someone like Teacher Sa may firmly believe that he has never deviated from democratic behavior in his life. Confucius discussed human nature, saying that only the wise and the foolish do not change. Master Sa is truly wise. Mencius explained the definition of an adult, saying that he does not lose the heart of a child. Master Sa is truly an adult. It is believable that from his childhood to his ninetieth birthday, he has never lost the heart of a child. This is my own opinion, and I am determined to believe it. I was quite expected by Teacher Sa in my youth, but I chose the wrong career and ended up being mediocre. I remember when I transferred from a merchant ship to the navy, a group of twelve people went to Beijing to take the exam. On the clear morning of our departure, Teacher Sa specially prepared Western pastries and asked us to have a meal to see us off. During the meal, a classmate suddenly innocently asked, 'Mr. Sa, we have never been to Nanjing. What should we do when we get there?' The teacher raised his head and thought for a while, looked around, and pointed to me, saying, 'Don't worry, just ask him.' How did the teacher know that I could be competent for this matter? I was really flattered and didn't know what to do. From this, it can be seen that the students' personalities and structures are always being observed in silence. Therefore, from then on, I always kept a mind of awe and caution. I also recall that when Yuan Shikai was negotiating the Twenty-One Demands with Japan, Teacher Sa was sent to the Hukou naval fleet to comfort the troops (at that time, the warships were concentrated there for a joint exercise). He was prepared to fight Japan to the death. The people were in turmoil, and the situation was tense. When the warships were swearing oaths and comforting the troops in Chu, he knew that I was an intern on the warship. That night, after returning to the flagship (Jiangli), he came to the flagship to order, and the English meaning was roughly: I want to see my student ×××. The captain informed me to send me over to the warship by speedboat. When I arrived, he asked me about my situation, treated me with Western pastries, knew that the allowance was too little (eighteen yuan for food), encouraged me to study hard, gave me special comfort, and before leaving, he gave me a translated copy of Washington's oath, and asked me to read it through myself. After I heard it, he took it back, folded it neatly, and the corners were not even a centimeter off, and then handed it back to me. This kind of solemn and careful expression is still vivid in my mind when I occasionally think of it."

### Reunited with Yan Dajiechou in Yuyao, Both Temples Covered in Frost, Feeling Like Worlds Apart

— Sanmu

My ambition has faded away in old age, who would believe that I was once so magnanimous? Don't blame the heroic spirit of the southeast for being exhausted, look at this person with a stooped back and a mottled head.

I once took my guests with short robes, brocade oars and embroidered rudder blurred in my dreams. To this day, I have exhausted the hands of slaying dragons. Who remembers A Shu in the twilight? (You once traveled with Taibao A Shu)

I send my feelings to Zhaitou, the spring tide rises like a jade pot in the evening. In my spare time, I look at the shadow of my hair by the stove, and I expect no more dreams of traveling the rivers and lakes.

For ten years, I generously bought rouge, and it was not too late to return home after hardship. I specially came to Zhaitou when the spring wine was ripe, and I want you to cherish your beautiful eyebrows.

Ren Ansui wrote this casually during a drinking session, showing it to Uncle Sanmu Fan, Jiechou.

We have opened our hearts for another time in a hundred years. The lamp is set in the small building, but the ashes fly away. I am glad that there are no friends or clubs to hook and connect us. We can come to the seat calmly with white hair.

Who made the wine battle force people to be proud? Come and deal with it, remember this spine. The old hall can bet drunk with a troop, how can it be said that the heroic spirit has not completely disappeared?

In the afternoon of the twenty-first, Ms. Shen, a female representative, chaired the National Assembly. According to the "gossip" published in the local newspapers, "Shen's enforcement is very strict and exceptionally polite, and she repeatedly said 'thank you' and 'sorry', which is truly polite and not strange. She can grasp the psychology of the representatives." As far as I know, this attitude and these humble words are often found among friends in the academic community, and not only among women.

Anyone who has received Western-style education or is accustomed to associating with European and American intellectuals knows that there is a natural courtesy in the questions of friends and acquaintances, that is, there are commonly used words. If a person benefits, he says Thank you, and if he is sorry, he says Excuse me. Regardless of the size or importance of the matter, even slightly related words and actions should always be prepared with this kind of verbal usage. This is true even for teachers towards students. When I was in school, my English teacher, Mr. Whittick, often used these two words to his classmates, and taught the students about the etiquette they should know. Although we do not follow them one by one (the reason is that except for the teacher, there is no need for them in the old-fashioned environment, and if we suddenly imitate them to people who are not accustomed to it, it will cause surprise), we have already known and kept them in mind. Also, when Chinese officials and Western teachers socialized, we often translated for them, and often felt the difficulty of "getting the meaning across". Sometimes it is a respectful word on one side, but it is a casual word on the other. Sometimes it is a very familiar word here, but it is stiff and incomprehensible there. It is precisely because I am responsible for this kind of translation that I pay attention to the differences and similarities between the words and sentences on both sides and examine and revise them. Therefore, I can easily distinguish the origin of Chinese words that have a Western tone.

From student life, I entered the life of teaching. Among my colleagues, there were Westerners, students who had studied in the West, and those who had not studied abroad but had grown accustomed to Western manners. Once, at a tea party, colleagues gathered together. One person was late. After entering the door, he socialized with the Westerners, repeatedly saying Excuse me, and repeatedly said "I'm sorry" to the Chinese people. Both are apologies and respect, with the same meaning, but the words are not consistent. Excuse me should be translated as "forgive me", which is a polite way to ask for forgiveness from the other party. As for "I'm sorry", it only states the fault of one's own side, and implicitly contains the meaning of asking for forgiveness. However, in Chinese habits (verbally), people always say "I'm sorry" or "I'm not worthy" more often, and rarely say "forgive me" (this does not apply to written form and those with context). Therefore, when Excuse me should be said in Western language, "I'm sorry" in Chinese is understood by everyone. As for Thank you meaning "thank you", both the transliteration and translation are the same, and no detailed explanation is needed. (Westerners often use you to the other party, which is not disrespectful, even to elders. This is because the word you was originally a respectful term, equivalent to "you" in Beijing, while "you" in Chinese is not very polite, so it is better to omit it. Fortunately, the second person can be omitted and understood.)

I don't know what kind of education the representative Shen in this telegram received, and her usual behavior, since I am far away. But I assume that she is a student who has studied abroad or is accustomed to Western etiquette, then her so-called "thank you" and "sorry" are common examples of verbal words in receptions or gatherings, and are not surprising. If you pay attention to other aspects, you can find many. It is well known that Dr. Hu Shih always has a humble and elegant demeanor, and even in the smallest programs, he often hears the words "thank you" and "sorry". Dr. Mei Wan Hua is always humble, and since returning to China from studying in the United States and often receiving foreign guests, his movements and interactions have completely followed the Western-style gentleman's demeanor, and similar oral words can be verified everywhere. It is the so-called habit becomes nature.
