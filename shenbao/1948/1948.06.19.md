### Legislators Criticize Soaring Prices; See it as a Challenge to the Government; Hope to Break Free from Face-Saving to Effectively Stop It

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] During the Legislative Yuan's meeting on the afternoon of the 18th to discuss the proposal to stabilize prices, the proposer, Zhang Zhijiang, first explained that prices are rising, and ordinary people work hard all day but cannot get enough to eat. The government's competent authorities talk about suppressing prices every day, but there is no effective solution. He pointed out that unscrupulous merchants are hoarding and speculating, bureaucratic capital is playing a role, product sources are decreasing, and supply is falling short of demand. If the government does not have the greatest determination to break free from face-saving and suppress prices, it will not be enough to relieve the people's suffering. Feng Jinping explained that soaring prices are not only a challenge to the Executive Yuan but also a challenge to the Legislative Yuan. The Legislative Yuan should be responsible for quickly devising effective measures to stop it. Yu Dezhen expressed his agreement, but did not advocate setting up another special committee. Liu Wendao criticized that the high prices are related to the malpractices of industrial loans, agricultural loans, and commercial loans. Miao Qiping said: If the government cannot stabilize prices, how can it talk about pacifying the world? Some people also pointed out that the main reason for the price increase is the manipulation by the four banks and two bureaus. Their financial measures have not been submitted to the audit department for review. If they are not feeling guilty, why would they evade it? Yang Bu and others also expressed their support for this proposal, which was resolved to be referred to the special committee for reviewing the gains and losses of national governance since the victory for review.

### Companies and Private Banks Engaging in Illegal Business Practices; Ordered to Cease Operations After Investigation; Ministries of Economic Affairs and Finance Order Local Authorities to Enforce

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Ministry of Economic Affairs reports: Previously, companies and private banks were found to be privately engaging in banking business. The Ministry, together with the Ministry of Finance, sent a telegram to all provincial and municipal governments to strictly ban this practice. Violators should be ordered to cease operations and be subject to fines. However, there was no uniform regulation as to whether companies and merchants violating the above-mentioned prohibition should be ordered to cease operations entirely or only the department engaged in banking business. Now, after consultation between the Ministry and the Ministry of Finance, it has been decided that in the future, if such cases are discovered, except for manufacturers that are indeed engaged in agricultural, industrial, or mining production or public transportation, they should be fined and ordered to cease operations of the department engaged in banking business to show a balance of interests. Other companies and merchants privately engaging in banking business, regardless of industry or scale, should be fined and ordered to cease operations entirely. The penalty of partial or complete cessation of operations must first be reported by the local competent authorities to the Ministry of Finance for consultation with the Ministry of Economic Affairs before being approved and enforced. The instructions have been jointly distributed to all provincial and municipal governments, and the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have separately ordered local guilds of money shops, financial management bureaus, provincial construction departments, and industrial and commercial associations to pay attention to reporting violations.

### The Control Yuan's Plenary Review Meeting Passes the Control Yuan Law Draft; Amendments to the Exercise of Consent Rights Also Passed; to be Submitted to the Fifth Yuan Meeting for Discussion Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The fifth meeting of the first Control Yuan under the Constitution will be held on the 19th to discuss the Control Law and the draft measures for the exercise of consent rights. In addition, the draft organizational laws of various committees and the organizational cases of the supervisory commissioner's offices will be discussed by the drafting committee before being submitted to the plenary meeting for discussion.

The Control Law draft and the draft measures for the Control Yuan's exercise of consent rights were amended and passed by the plenary review committee held all day on the 18th.

Contents of the Control Law

The Control Law has six chapters. The general principles and rectification chapters were passed in the morning, and the impeachment, censure, investigation, and supplementary provisions were passed in the afternoon. Among them, the impeachment chapter was discussed for a longer time and underwent more amendments. At the same time, strict deadlines were set for the handling of cases. The chapter stipulates that after the examination and decision by nine or more control commissioners other than the proposing commissioner, the Control Yuan should immediately transfer the impeached person for disciplinary action. The examination of the impeachment case should be carried out by all control commissioners in turn. If, after examination, it is deemed that it should not be transferred for disciplinary action, and the proposing commissioner has objections, the impeachment case should be referred to another committee for examination as the final decision. All these provisions are intended to avoid the arbitrary decisions of a few commissioners and easy decisions. After today's discussion, a new clause was added at the end of the chapter: "The impeached personnel shall not be promoted during the disciplinary proceedings." This comes from past experience, where the corruption and illegal activities of a person, once exposed, would be transferred to another position, making it impossible to pursue the matter.

Contents of Consent Rights

The draft measures for the exercise of consent rights have a total of ten articles. The procedure stipulated therein is that the Control Yuan's exercise of consent rights should be examined by the plenary committee and then submitted to the Control Yuan meeting for voting. The plenary committee should examine the resumes and certificates attached to the persons nominated by the President. The committee shall elect one of its members as chairman, and its meetings shall be held in secret. Most members believe that whether or not the Control Yuan agrees to the President's nomination is an unknown matter, but if it is not examined in advance, it would undermine the President's prestige and be detrimental to the nominee if the nominee is rejected. Therefore, it is held in secret; the holding of secret meetings is only to prevent eavesdropping by journalists, which is very different from the open debate in the Legislative Yuan.

### US Aid Secretary General Shen Xirui Takes Office

### Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, and Lei Zhen in Shanghai Invite the Democratic Socialist Party to Discuss; The Democratic Socialist Party Agrees to Serve as the Vice President of the Judicial Yuan

[News from this newspaper] Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, and Lei Zhen invited the Young China Party representatives Zuo Shunsheng, Chen Qitian, Li Huang, and Yu Fuxian to Wanglu at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to discuss. Zhang Qun gave a speech, emphasizing the President's sincere hope for cooperation between the three parties, and hoping that the Young China Party will understand the Kuomintang's difficulties in the issue of legislators. He also said that the Young China Party originally had eight elected legislators, and now the Kuomintang can give up five seats. In the future, with persuasion, there may be five more, for a total of ten seats. In other words, the number of legislators of the Young China Party can be increased to eighteen, and it is hoped that the Young China Party can accept this number and participate in the government as soon as possible. The two sides discussed until noon, but the Young China Party did not give a definite answer, but agreed to convene an internal standing committee at 4:00 p.m. to make a decision. This meeting started at 4:00 p.m. and did not end until about 8:00 p.m. After the meeting, discussions continued at Zuo's residence. The contents were kept strictly confidential.

[News from this newspaper] According to reliable sources: The participation of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Young China Party in the Judicial Yuan and the Examination Yuan has become easier with the arrival of Zhang Qun and Wu Tiecheng in Shanghai. The government has invited Shi Zhiquan, a member of the Democratic Socialist Party, to serve as the Vice President of the Judicial Yuan. Zhang Jun has expressed his agreement on this matter, but it still needs to solicit Shi's opinion. For the position of Vice President of the Examination Yuan, the government intends to invite He Luzhi of the Young China Party to serve, but the candidate still needs to be approved by the Central Standing Committee of the party. The work supervised by both the Judicial Yuan and the Examination Yuan takes impartiality as the basic condition. Therefore, the party members who participate in the two Yuans will no longer bear the actual responsibility within the party.

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The person in charge of the Young China Party said that the issue of legislators is difficult to resolve unless there is a new plan. Although the party is willing to understand the government's difficulties, it believes that there are too many difficulties, so it decided to maintain its original position and not participate in the Executive Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Examination Yuan. This decision was immediately notified to Mr. Lei Zhen.

### Two Petitions to the Presidential Palace by Henan People in Beijing; Legislator Duan Jianmin Kneels Before Advisor Gu Zhutong, Begging for Help for Kaifeng

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Kaifeng is in dire straits. Henan people in Beijing are rushing about all day to save their hometown. Twelve Henan senators and national representatives went to the Presidential Palace at 10:00 AM on the 18th to petition the President. Because the President was out, Director Chen of the Second Bureau met with them and reported to the President by phone. The President expressed extreme concern about the situation in Kaifeng, but said that preparations had already been made and that the safety of Kaifeng was absolutely not a problem. In the afternoon, Henan people in Beijing reconvened and decided to gather over a hundred fellow villagers, including legislators, supervisors, national representatives, and senators in Beijing, to petition the Presidential Palace at 6:00 PM. Yu Jishi and others received them and promised to convey their requests to the President. In addition, eleven legislators, supervisors, and national representatives went to visit Gu Zhutong, requesting (1) the speedy dispatch of a large army to lift the siege of Kaifeng within a set time limit; (2) the dispatch of powerful air force to assist in the battle in Bian day and night; (3) the speedy dispatch of high officials to Zhengzhou to take command.

### The Necessity and Path to Economic Stability

Strengthening suppression of disorder and stabilizing the economy are the two major focuses of the new Executive Yuan's policy. However, in the past ten days, the wave of price increases has been particularly intense. The Legislative Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, and other parties are especially concerned about emergency economic measures.

Premier Weng has announced his price policy twice in the Legislative Yuan. He will continue to implement past methods, such as selling off materials, tightening issuance, using American aid materials, issuing treasury bonds, and issuing shares of state-owned enterprises. At the same time, he will use sufficient supply and universal distribution as countermeasures to suppress prices. Of course, it cannot be said that he is wrong. However, apart from the issuance of shares of state-owned enterprises, which has not yet materialized, prices in various places have been fluctuating, with more increases than decreases. The extent of the increases is continuing to grow, almost without limit. It is clear that simply repeating these old tunes cannot serve as genuine emergency measures, nor can it achieve the goal of economic stability.

There are naturally many reasons for soaring prices. However, to summarize, they are nothing more than two major factors: too much currency and too little material. This is something that no one can deny. Regarding the former, at a time when military expenditures are huge and national revenues and expenditures cannot be balanced, it seems that increasing currency issuance has become a matter of course. The responsible authorities have repeatedly publicly declared that this is an unavoidable emergency measure. But whether this statement is entirely reliable and whether there are other remedial measures seems worth further study.

According to the recent budget for the second half of the year compiled by the Ministry of Finance, the total revenue is over 540 trillion yuan. The expenditure budget is still being prepared. It is said that the amount still exceeds the total revenue estimate. Roughly speaking, ordinary revenues and expenditures are expected to balance, but special expenditures must be addressed separately. The fact that they must be addressed separately means that one cannot but rely on increasing the issuance of banknotes to make up for the deficit. Before a formal announcement, it is impossible to make an accurate estimate. However, the items and total amount of revenue that can be increased currently are not small. Minister of Finance Wang announced four methods: (1) increasing tax sources and rectifying tax revenue; (2) utilizing American aid; (3) selling relief materials; (4) selling enemy and puppet materials. In addition, there are surplus materials, indemnity materials, confiscated property of traitors, and the cash portion obtained from the sale of American aid materials. In total, the amount should be quite considerable. Even 300 million US dollars, spent over 12 months, at 25 million US dollars per month, someone estimated, can be used to offset 50 trillion yuan in legal tender. In that case, the current deficit, even if, as Minister of Finance Wang stated, May's revenue was 15 trillion yuan and expenditures were 75 trillion yuan, a difference of as much as 60 trillion yuan, five-sixths of it can easily be made up for by this. Moreover, the issuance of shares of state-owned enterprises, as part of the legal tender reserve, is generally recognized as being under the management of currency. In fact, its benefits and amount are not of great significance. It is better to convert it into cash to offset government spending, which is more practical and effective. If this is done, the revenue and expenditure shortfall for the second half of this year is not absolutely without a solution. If it can be filled, then, whether entirely or partially, the degree of reliance on increasing banknote issuance will necessarily decrease or become unnecessary, and the trend of currency inflation can therefore be stopped or slowed down. Therefore, the most urgent measures at present should be: (1) speedily formulating methods and figures that can fill the gap; (2) fulfilling the promise of reducing government expenditures, and abolishing and reducing all overlapping agencies and redundant personnel, as well as unnecessary or non-urgent project expenses, within a set time limit; (3) announcing the accurate figures for currency issuance on a regular basis, as well as the actual situation for when issuance can be stopped or reduced. If the Legislative Yuan's proposal to establish a Legal Tender Issuance Management Committee to limit currency inflation can be carried out, public confidence in legal tender will naturally increase, and the trend of speculative national debt and capital flight will automatically disappear. Moreover, the nation's various expenditures will not increase month by month due to rising prices, without limit. The entire national economy will necessarily improve day by day.

As for the lack of materials, utilizing foreign aid is indeed a temporary emergency method, but the fundamental remedy cannot but start with increasing production. This requires the joint labor of the masses and the separate development of all parties, so that everyone has a job and everyone has food to eat. Therefore, the most important plan a month ago was not to lavishly discuss construction, concentrating funds on a specific industry, nor was it to decorate the façade with empty talk on how to promote protection, but rather to boldly remove all obstacles that prevent the masses from finding employment, creating a production environment where they can barely make a living, so that merchants can be at ease in the market, workers can be at ease in the factory, and farmers can be at ease in the fields. Moreover, it is not permissible for large numbers of self-sufficient, law-abiding citizens to become displaced and become refugees waiting for relief due to tax evasion, draft evasion, factory evasion, and even evasion of forced purchases at low prices. Only then can production increase and prices fall. When Premier Weng made a statement in the Legislative Yuan, he admitted that household registration was unclear and that village chiefs inevitably disturbed the people. He decided to clarify the military service and adopt a conscription system, and also said that he would prohibit all levies and taxes other than those officially stipulated. Regarding the current practical malpractices, he solemnly declared that these were unavoidable measures during times of turmoil and would strive for simplicity and certainty to avoid disturbing the people. It can be seen that the authorities are not entirely unaware of the various situations of the officials harassing the people and the people being unable to make a living. It is a pity that he did not mention a word about the fine-meshed prohibition and the thorny path for merchants, the difficulties faced by factory owners, and the dilemma of wanting to stop but being unable to. Whether he has grasped the center of gravity in clearing obstacles and creating a barely sustainable production environment remains to be proven by facts. However, we believe that if these two symptoms of too much currency and too little material are not treated with the right medicine and fundamentally treated, then asking for economic stability and price stability is probably like climbing a tree to catch fish.

### Former Jurong County Magistrate Shi Qimin Embezzles Tax Grain; Ordered to Clear Debt Within a Time Limit

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 18th] Former Jurong County Magistrate Shi Qimin, who misappropriated rice and failed to repay it, was taken into custody by the Jiangsu Provincial Government's police bureau yesterday, and ordered to repay the full amount within ten days. The main culprits in the case, Liu Mingjin and Wang Weimin, have also been escorted to Zhenjiang and are currently being interrogated by the District Court Prosecutor's Office.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 17th] The Jurong County Council believes that the case of former County Magistrate Shi Qimin embezzling 12,700 shi of local tax grain has caused the provincial chairman Wang to set a deadline of two weeks to be responsible for clearing the debt, and now the deadline has long passed, without a single grain being delivered, resulting in the June salaries of public servants and teachers in the county not being paid. The speaker of the council, Hua Xuanlou, came to Zhenjiang on the 16th and petitioned the Provincial Government and the Grain Bureau on the 17th, requesting that effective measures be taken quickly to order repayment.

[Our Jurong Dispatch, 16th] The County Council believes that the case of former County Magistrate Shi Qimin embezzling tax grain has greatly affected the county's administration and the livelihood of teachers. On the 15th, the council specially requested that the county government supervise the former Deputy Director of the Grain Bureau, Zhang Bi, and not allow him to leave the county until the handover is completed. The council believes that this move will definitely prompt the central and provincial governments to pay attention and order Shi Qimin to return the embezzled tax grain within a time limit.

[Another Dispatch] The two squadrons directly under the county's command, the first and second, have collapsed and disbanded on the afternoon of the 14th because Shi Qimin owed too much tax grain, and salaries could not be paid.

[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office on the 18th] Following Mayor Yang Sen's remarks to our newspaper's reporter regarding the Yang Mei incident, the secondary inspection of Yang Mei is now being carefully undertaken.

Director Li and the members of the Yang Mei Research Committee, after careful consideration, believe it is more appropriate for Yang Mei to temporarily reside in a secret location within the city after leaving Jiulongpo. This is because the committee members all have duties, and Lin Garden is too far and inconvenient for transportation, hindering research. After the clinical work (including examinations of all bodily functions and the testing of various organ functions, etc.) comes to a conclusion, and after domestic and foreign experts arrive in Chongqing, Yang Mei will then move to Lin Garden for in-depth research by the experts, which is still necessary.

The members of the Yang Mei Research Committee are Health Bureau Director Li Zhiyu, Section Chief He Zongwen, Citizen Hospital Director Jiang Zhu Hua, Zhongzheng Hospital Director Hu Xianwen, Surgery Director Hu Xianhua, Air Force Hospital Director Gu Zheqing, Army General Hospital Director Yuan Yinguang, and Wuhan Sanitarium Director Huang Ricong.

From today onwards, all external inquiries regarding Yang Mei will be handled by the Health Bureau, with Hu Xianhua of the Research Committee responsible for answering them.

[News from Our Agency] London, 18th (Broadcast): Berlin reports that currency reform in the three Western occupation zones has been announced tonight, with Berlin temporarily excluded. According to regulations, West Germans holding identification and ration cards can exchange sixty old Marks for sixty new Marks, to be issued in two installments. The first installment of forty Marks will be issued on Sunday, and the remaining twenty Marks will be issued one month later. From June 21st, old Marks will be invalidated, except for metal coins and one-Mark notes, which will remain in circulation to prevent a shortage of change, but their value will be one-tenth of a new Mark. Detailed measures will be announced gradually.

[News from Our Agency] London, 18th (Broadcast): Paris reports that, according to information obtained by the French government, the Soviet Union is preparing to announce currency reform in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany within 48 hours, taking independent action.

[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] Reliable sources claim that the currency reform in the British, French, and American zones of Western Germany can be formally announced on the 18th. The military governors of the three powers will issue a broadcast on that day, announcing the currency reform plan to the German people. The currency reform will be implemented from the 20th. In the first week, old and new Marks will be exchanged at par value. After one week, the exchange rate will be ten old Marks for one new Mark.

[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] The Germans are awaiting the Western German currency reform plan, which will be announced within a few hours and implemented on Sunday, with extreme tension. The German Economic Council of the British and American Combined Zone convened an emergency meeting at 3 a.m. this morning to inform the members of the situation before the announcement of the currency reform. According to reports from the American military zone's German News Agency, Economic Council Chairman Köhler told the participating members that currency reform is the most painful experience for a country and is a direct result of the Nazi regime. After the first step of the currency reform is completed, the members must provide advice and support to the German nation. It is reported that Soviet military government chief Sokolovsky made a final suggestion to the British, Americans, and French in Berlin yesterday, offering to implement currency reform throughout Germany on a four-power basis.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 18th] Meyer, Chairman of the Economic Administration Commission of the Soviet Zone, declared today that no measures have been taken regarding the independent currency reform of the Soviet Zone. However, he also said that if the Western occupation zones adopt independent currency reform, then various steps will also be taken.

[United Press, London, 18th] Diplomatic observers here believe that Poland's request to reopen the Allied Control Council may be the beginning of a Soviet effort to indefinitely delay the six-nation Western plan. The British Foreign Office refused to comment immediately on Poland's note presented in Berlin and the country's protest to France against the six-nation agreement.

### Soviet Union Uses Third Parties to Restore Allied Control Council

American Ambassador Douglas paid a routine visit to British Foreign Secretary Bevin at the Foreign Office on the 18th. It is believed that the two will discuss Poland's actions and France's attitude. Foreign Office officials admit that Poland has always paid close attention to Germany, but speculate that Poland's proposal to reopen the Allied Control Council was orchestrated by the Soviet Union. Soviet Commander Sokolovsky withdrew from the Allied Control Council on March 20th, forcing the council to shut down. If the Soviet Union currently intends to restore it, it can be in a more bargainable position by having a third party suggest it. Some Britons fear that once the council is reopened, the Soviet Union will use it to spread propaganda against the Allied powers' plans for Germany.

### US Pays Attention to Far East Situation; Soviet Policy Shows Signs of Change; State of Emergency Declared Throughout Malaya

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] The State Department is closely watching the situation in Burma, and diplomatic circles are speculating about the possibility of a communist offensive in the Far East. They particularly point out the recent comparative calm in Europe, the recent unrest in Burma and Malaya, the Soviet Union's concessions on reparations to Hungary, Finland, and Romania, and the stabilizing trend of the Greek civil war, all of which indicate that the Communist Party in Europe has shifted from offense to defense, while in Asia it has shifted from defense to offense.

The well-known "Washington Post" reporter Lippmann, who is close to the State Department, wrote in the newspaper that the new Soviet representatives to the United Nations and the ambassadors to the United States are all experts on Asian issues. Judging from past experience, the Soviet Union often changes diplomatic officials when it is preparing to change its policies. Lippmann also pointed out that most Asian nations have never known what freedom is, so communism is easier to develop in Asia than in Europe. It is feared that the nationalistic tendencies of Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma, and India are more likely to lean towards Moscow than towards the West.

### A Perspective on the Varga Incident

— Huang Shaozu

Is E. Varga always the supreme authority in Soviet economics, and the leading figure in the entire world of Marxist economic theory? Although he was originally from Hungary, he had long acquired Soviet citizenship, and for two or three decades since the Soviet October Revolution, he had consistently occupied the throne of Soviet economic theory. He has written many works, and almost every one of them is representative and of great significance. In particular, almost every year in the past, he published an article summarizing and predicting the Soviet economy and the capitalist world economy. The content was nothing more than a stark contrast, proclaiming how the Soviet socialist economy was becoming increasingly prosperous and developed, while the economy of the capitalist world was becoming increasingly chaotic and declining. Most touchingly, he annually declared that the capitalist economy had developed to its final stage, so a worldwide economic panic would immediately occur, leading to the total collapse of the capitalist economy. Although these words were spoken every year, and each time they turned out to be wrong, their impact was still enormous. Not only did the Soviet authorities attach unusual importance and encouragement to it, spreading his views as widely as possible, but leftists all over the world also regarded his every word as golden rules, as valuable keys to understanding current economic phenomena. Therefore, citations like "as Varga said" were seen everywhere. In short, among Marxist economists of the same era, no one's position and reputation were as esteemed and lofty as his.

However, it is precisely this Mr. Varga who is now being fiercely criticized and rigorously purged by the Soviet authorities and the Soviet economics community. What is the reason for being suddenly thrown from heaven to earth? The reason is that his current views are contrary to his past predictions. He actually believes that the capitalist world economy will not only not "collapse" for the time being, but also has a certain prospect for development. Such "reactionary" views could hardly be tolerated by the Soviet authorities and Marxist "orthodox" scholars, and he would inevitably suffer serious blows.

The actual situation of the Varga incident is as follows: Last autumn, based on his careful observation of the real situation of the world economy, Varga wrote the book "Changes in the Capitalist Economy Since the End of World War II." In this book, his basic viewpoints are:

(1) He believes that the state played a decisive role in the economies of capitalist countries during the war, and that capitalist countries also have a certain "supra-class nature," that is, although they represent the overall interests of the bourgeoisie as a whole, they often individually oppose the interests of certain bourgeoisies. His original words were: "The bourgeois state here represents the interests of the entire bourgeoisie as a class. It strives to make the most appropriate use of national resources for war purposes, and as a result, it often conflicts with the private interests of individual capitalist attempts and their desire to extract as much profit as possible." He cited the government's opposition to and suppression of the monopolies or speculative behavior of private capitalists as examples to illustrate. At the same time, he further believes that "in the post-war period, the role of the state will be even more significant than during the war."

(2) Furthermore, he pointed out that the long-held view that the capitalist economy cannot be planned is erroneous and does not conform to the facts. He said: "Regarding the issue of planning under the capitalist system, we are also often constrained by old ideas, always believing that we have a planned economy, while under the capitalist system, production is everywhere, always and indiscriminately controlled by a state of anarchy. I don't think the issue should be raised like this." Then, he admitted: "In some capitalist countries, there has appeared something similar to a unique 'national plan'."

(3) He divides the changes in the post-war capitalist world economy into two types—temporary and long-term. He believes that temporary changes will determine the development of capitalism in the next ten years or so; while long-term changes will only be fully revealed after the countries reach the pre-war production level, that is, at least ten years later. In the first stage, he said: "The imbalance of economic development during the war will have a decisive impact on the economic development of capitalism." It will not be until the second stage, when the changes in capitalism caused by the war are fully revealed, that they will be manifested in "the fundamental contradiction of the capitalist system—the intensification of the contradiction between the socialization of production and the privatization of ownership, and will first be manifested in the market problem." That is to say, within the next ten years, the inherent contradictions of capitalism will not unfold and deepen, so capitalism still has a period of development prospects. However, he has repeatedly declared in the past that capitalism has developed to its third stage, that is, the final stage.

(4) Varga's evaluation of the so-called "new democratic" economy in Southeast European countries is very low. He believes that in those countries, "state capitalism occupies a dominant position, but it cannot be regarded as a new type of capitalist (in the old sense) economy appearing in these countries, and they cannot fundamentally change the development prospects of the entire capitalism." That is to say, he believes that the development of the capitalist economy is still the main content of current history.

The above theory is obviously completely contrary to his past views, that is, the orthodox Marxist views, and the views that meet the actual requirements of Soviet policy. This will naturally cause a major criticism from the Soviet orthodox economics community, and further lead to a ruthless purge by the Soviet authorities.

In particular, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which bears the actual highest leadership responsibility in the Soviet Union, is particularly disgusted with this. Because with Varga's position, writing such a viewpoint would naturally have a great adverse impact on her external Cold War propaganda or internal rule education. Therefore, in any case, Varga must be severely criticized and severely attacked, and he must be completely overthrown.

The specific arrangement is: on the one hand, all orthodox Marxist economists were mobilized to publish criticisms in newspapers and magazines, criticizing Varga's "mistakes"; on the other hand, a large-scale gathering of economists was convened, nominally as a "review meeting" but actually equivalent to a "trial," to have Varga publicly attend and answer questions, making him the target of public criticism, and allowing everyone to refute him "to the point of being completely defeated." This was not enough. In addition, he was removed from his original position as director of the Institute of International Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and he was also prohibited from giving public lectures and publishing books. As for the book "Changes in the Capitalist Economy Since the End of World War II," it goes without saying that it was regarded as a great treason and was banned from circulation.

At the "review meeting," the views expounded by Varga in this book were naturally criticized to the extreme, pointing out that they "violated Marxist theory" or violated the "opinions" of Lenin and Stalin, but it was rarely or even never seen that they were pointed out to be contrary to the facts. Therefore, the Soviet authorities and this group of orthodox Marxist economists' struggle to purge Varga is precisely a struggle between "dogma" and "truth," a struggle between "propaganda" and "facts." Varga has always obeyed "dogma" and willingly "propagated," and all he has received is praise, no blame; only happiness, no misfortune. Once he, based on the last conscience of a theoretical worker, is unwilling to turn white into black again, pursue facts, and follow the truth, then he will naturally not be able to stand in a country where everything must obey partisanship, and he will inevitably suffer a fatal blow, and his political life will be purged and ended.

But as a theoretical worker with independent thought and a complete personality, he should be such a brave man who is loyal to the truth and loyal to the facts. We see that even at the "review meeting," Varga still defended his views eloquently. It is not that he does not love his motherland, the Soviet Union, and even more so that he does not love himself personally, but he loves the truth even more and respects the facts even more, so he naturally and bravely did so regardless of success or failure and regardless of danger. This spirit of Varga is worthy of respect from every conscientious person.

Managing Bank Note Shops, Selling Materials, Sending Three Key Members of the National Bank to North China to Prevent Floating Capital from Coming South

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yu Hongjun, President of the National Bank, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday and visited Mayor Wu in the afternoon to discuss strengthening the crackdown on speculation involving gold and banknotes. At 5:00 PM, he held a press conference and announced three important measures: (1) In order to prevent credit expansion and control prices, the government has decided to strictly manage the issuance of bank notes. From today (the 19th), when bank note shops issue bank notes, the balance of the bank note account for the day must have sufficient funds deposited in the National Bank or the clearing house. After this measure is implemented, the outstanding balance of bank notes issued by bank note shops in the past must be supplemented and deposited with the National Bank. Those who fail to report accurately will be subject to revocation of their licenses. (2) Starting today, the government will sell off large quantities of yarn, cloth, and other materials without rigidly setting prices. (3) In order to prevent floating capital from coming south from North China, responsible personnel from the National Bank will be sent north within days to improve exchange restrictions to prevent the private transportation of cash. At the same time, materials will be sold off in North China, and short-term treasury bonds will be vigorously promoted in Beijing and Tianjin to absorb floating capital.

Regarding the key members of the National Bank sent to North China, Yu announced yesterday that they are Li Lixia (Director of the Audit Department), Xia Jinxiong (Director of the National Treasury Bureau), and Wang Wei (Director of the National Bank's Northeast Region).

### Director of the Central Trust Bureau, Wu Rencang, Dies of a Stroke, Body Moved to China Funeral Home for Final Farewell Tomorrow Afternoon

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mr. Wu Rencang, Director of the Central Trust Bureau, suddenly suffered a stroke and died at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon at the age of 45. Since taking office in March of last year, Mr. Wu has worked tirelessly to rectify the bureau affairs. Due to excessive hard work, he has suffered from high blood pressure since last winter. In mid-March of this year, Mr. Wu once collapsed in his office. At that time, the doctor advised him to rest. However, after resting for a week and his blood pressure dropped slightly, Mr. Wu continued to work as usual. At about 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Mr. Wu invited the managers of the Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Taiwan branches of the bureau, as well as senior personnel from the Shanghai branch, to his residence for a lunch discussion on the transfer and handling of American aid materials. He felt uncomfortable at that time, and suddenly collapsed at about 2:00 PM. His family invited doctors from the Hongqiao, Zhongshan, and Zhongde Hospitals to diagnose him, and he was diagnosed with a stroke. Because the blood vessels had ruptured, a bloodletting operation could not be performed. Although he was injected with stimulants and rescued in many ways, all efforts were ineffective. He died at 5:00 PM. People from all walks of life were shocked and deeply saddened. The body will be given a final farewell at the China Funeral Home at 3:00 PM on the 20th, and the burial date has not been determined.

### Smuggling Arms in Wooden Boats with False Bottoms Using Secret Codes to Reach Bandit Areas, Changzhou Fugitive Arrested in Shanghai

[Report from Wujin on the 18th] Hua Xingsheng and others, the fugitives in the Hu Tangqiao military and agricultural support bandit case, have been living in Shanghai for many years. They have their own western-style houses and live in luxury. Recently, they have regrouped and cooperated, pooling shares, hiring multiple wooden boats with false bottoms, buying military uniforms and military supplies in separate groups, hiding them at the bottom, and covering them with sugarcane and other items. They declared to customs that they were shipping them to Qingdao for export, but they actually delivered them to the bandit areas in northern Jiangsu, earning profits of 30 to 40 times. Bandits along the way provided care. Hua and others traveled by land from Wuxi, Chengjiang to Jingjiang, using secret codes to enter the bandit area, and most of the payments were made in gold. This had happened more than once. The county criminal police team learned of this and disguised themselves on the 15th, arresting Hua and his accomplices Xu Kaisheng, Zhou Xinfu, and 12 others at the Zhongnan Hotel at 506 Zhongzheng Road in Shanghai. They also seized two boxes of rifle screws, four boxes of box gun screws, dozens of pieces of purple copper plate for making bullet casings, and hundreds of buckets of detonators.

### President of Jiaotong University Goes to Nanjing to Resign, Issues a Thousand-Word Proclamation Before Leaving, Accusing Students of Disregarding Discipline

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu's second inquiry to Jiaotong University regarding the student anti-Japanese parade on June 5 has been answered by the school. Cheng Xiaogang, President of Jiaotong University, went to Nanjing the night before to resign to the authorities. The executive committee of the Student Union also resigned en masse yesterday.

President Cheng has found it quite difficult to handle school affairs in recent years, and has repeatedly requested to resign since January of last year. After repeated retention by alumni and students, his resignation intention has not been dispelled. He has not received his salary for June, which indicates his firm intention to resign. Before going to Nanjing this time, he wrote a proclamation to all students, with several thousand words, in addition to blaming himself for "lacking virtue and ability" and failing to eliminate the student unrest in advance, he also accused "students of greatly disregarding discipline, and even resisting the discipline implemented by the school on the pretext of causing some bad habits." He criticized the Student Union, saying that "not only has it never led autonomy, nor has it assisted the school, and it often destroys order first, and even hinders the school from maintaining order," pointing to it as a factor in the school's instability and lack of progress.

### Proposed Dissolution of Student Union

In Principal Cheng's announcement, he stated: "Since the last student union's unsuccessful dissuasion and prohibition, and the subsequent resolution to march, the faculty has requested that I sanction the student union. After careful consideration, I intend to dissolve it and prohibit the current officers from being re-elected. I am confident that this action will benefit both the school and the students. Unfortunately, the Municipal Government also inquired about the matter and suggested an investigation. Considering that one offense should not be punished twice, I have temporarily suspended the proceedings. However, the school's position must be stated clearly, and I hope the student union will reflect on its actions." He concluded by advising that if they could deeply reflect and repent now, it would not be too late. Because Principal's Cheng's announcement contained many criticisms of them, twenty officers of the National Chiao Tung University Student Self-Government Association collectively resigned yesterday and issued an announcement to all students, stating that their initial purpose in being elected was to serve all students and maintain the honor of Chiao Tung University. Now that the principal believed they were doing the opposite, they were resigning to take responsibility. They also expressed their firm support for retaining Principal Cheng. In addition, they declared three points: (1) After resigning, they would bear absolute and complete responsibility for all work done during their term. The new self-government association would have no connection to any work done during their term. (2) Before the new self-government association was formed, all aspects of the current association's work would continue as usual. (3) Regarding the work done during this term and the difficulties with Shanghai, they would give a detailed report to the students before formally resigning and the new self-government association was formed, and would invite students to thoroughly criticize and review it.

### Department Representatives to Hold General Meeting Today

### Preliminary Examination of "Shanghai Yang Sister" Shows No Abnormalities, Has Been Drinking Water and Smoking Cigarettes for Three Days

[Our Newspaper Reports] Whether "Shanghai Yang Sister" Zhang Dailin has not eaten for several years and what her current living conditions are like is a question that various parties in the city are waiting for the answer to gradually unfold. According to Huang Linshu, a specialist from the Social Affairs Bureau who has become Zhang's "temporary father", based on three days of on-site observation: Zhang is not absolutely not eating, but has eaten one banana in three days, drinks four cups of water each time, and smokes twenty high-quality cigarettes. Zhang moved into Huang's residence on the 16th, and the 17th was her regular "three-day feeding" period. However, because she saw a report in a newspaper on the same day that she was a dancing girl, she was very unhappy and angrily gave up the banana. Although Huang bought more bananas yesterday and advised her to eat them, she said that "expired food should be discarded", so she has not eaten any food except for water and cigarettes for the past three days.

Yesterday, Huang invited Dr. Li Lin to conduct a preliminary physiological examination of Zhang. The examination results: no swollen lymph nodes, normal uterine position, and no abnormalities in any part of the body, only a slightly weak pulse. Li regretted that he was unable to examine Zhang's excrement, because Zhang happened to be menstruating on the 17th, and she had several bowel movements every day, but all of them had been flushed down the toilet, so he could not make a definitive judgment based solely on a morphological examination. Starting today, Li decided to work with two nurses to conduct a more detailed study of Zhang's life. If he can reach a conclusion within a few days, he will submit it to the Shanghai Medical Association and request that Zhang be moved to a quiet hospital, where all Shanghai doctors and physiologists will be responsible for the research task. The medical community in this city has long been eager to study Yang Sister, and this opportunity to study Zhang may lead to an honorary discovery about human physiology.

When Zhang appeared before reporters yesterday after a four-hour afternoon nap, it was hard to believe that she was a woman who had not eaten for several years. Her hair was shiny, her eyes sparkled, her skin was fair, her figure was slender, she was barefoot but wore high-heeled shoes, a red floral linen cheongsam, her steps were light, and she spoke softly and politely. In particular, her body was well-proportioned, and her breasts were high. According to the medical principle that muscles must be nourished by protein, Dr. Li said that he could not explain her not eating in terms of common sense.

However, there were two points in which she differed slightly from ordinary people: she had a particularly keen sense of feeling and a vague memory. She often complained that the teacup had an annoying smell, so Huang Linshu specially bought her a new cup. She also often frowned and changed her expression while talking and laughing, got up from her seat, and no one could understand why her emotions changed so quickly and abruptly, as if there was no one else present. She said that she had been in Shanghai for three or four years, and also said that she had been there for more than ten years. She claimed that she had started not eating when she was sixteen, and also said that she was twelve, but she only determined her age to be twenty-one, but no one could believe that this was her real age.

Because Zhang's nerves seemed to be abnormal, her background was difficult to confirm. According to her own account, she is from Tianjin, her parents died early, and her husband, Zhang Pengfei (i.e., Zhang Tianyi), worked in Guangde during the Anti-Japanese War. After the victory, he was sent to Tianjin to take over the Jinpu Railway section, and the two fell in love and married at this time. Zhang Pengfei is currently a security inspector at the Port Affairs Committee, but because it is difficult to find a house in Shanghai, he has not yet settled down. Zhang now hopes to have children to relieve her loneliness. According to Dr. Li's observation, she likes to be close to children and likes to dress up, which proves that she still has sexual desires, and her menstruation still comes every three months, so it is not impossible for her to have children.

Talking About the Reason for Not Eating: Due to Stepmother's Abuse

Zhang's intelligence is no different from that of ordinary people, and she is especially lacking in the appearance of someone who does not eat. She reads newspapers every day, has a high level of understanding, can sing, is good at dancing, and can speak fluent Shanghainese in addition to Mandarin. The night before last, she went to the Minguang Theater to watch the movie "The侠盗平番" (The Chivalrous Bandit Pacifies the Barbarians), but there was no reaction on her face after watching it. She claimed that she had been abused by her stepmother since she was a child, so she resolved to stop eating. After moving into Huang's residence, she covered her face and passed by when she saw others eating, looking quite disgusted. Someone told her that her not eating would cause serious abnormal behavior, and she said with emotion: "At most, I'll just die", and her words were full of infinite sadness. When she saw Huang Linshu and his wife, she shouted adoptive parents, which was very gentle, and she seemed to be in urgent need of loving care. Based on these two points, it is speculated that Zhang's nerves may be slightly abnormal, possibly due to deep stimulation in her early years. However, the maid at Zhang's previous residence said that her stepmother had recently sent a letter to her, intending to provide her with financial assistance, so her relationship with her stepmother did not seem to be broken.

Believes in Buddhism and Christianity, Actions are Puzzling

Since the news of Yang Sister's not eating spread, Zhang smiled secretly at how surprised and strange the world was. When various parties commented that not eating was definitely impossible, she cursed and rebuked them, and that's how her not eating was finally revealed. She said that she had been a Buddhist since she was a child, and recently became a devout Christian, but if she was forced to read scriptures or attend services, she would not be interested. Yesterday, she entered the room to visit Huang's mother, who was sick in bed, and refused to allow anyone else to enter at the same time. Later, Huang peeked through the keyhole and saw her writing rapidly on paper with a pencil, like drawing talismans, then sticking the paper on the Guanyin statue on the wall in a circle, drinking a mouthful of water and spitting it out like a Taoist priest performing a ritual, and finally tapping Huang's mother all over the body, with a tense and forceful movement, which was even more puzzling.

Zhang has an extremely strong sense of beauty. Because her face is slightly asymmetrical, she often covers her forehead with her hair to maintain facial balance. She also went to the hairdresser's the other day to perm her hair. Dr. Li pointed out that this was unimaginable, because the temperature of the head during a perm is extremely high, and the smell of ammonia is pungent, which a person who has not eaten for several years and has a nervous disorder would not be able to tolerate. Zhang loves cleanliness as if it were her life, and if her clothes have any oil stains, she throws them away. She gets up at 6:00 AM every morning, regardless of the cold or heat. She often talks to herself. Apart from the fact that her abdomen is particularly sunken, she does not think there is anything abnormal about her inner self or physiology, and she also says to people, what is so special about not eating? Why is everyone so surprised!

### Theater Manager Marries, Shows Off Wealth, Impersonates Others to Send Flower Baskets and Festive Banners, Check is Returned and He is Detained for Questioning

[Our Newspaper Reports] On the morning of the 5th of this month, a man claiming to be Mi Dafeng, the section chief of the Municipal Government's Protocol Department, suddenly came to Shunxing Flower Shop at No. 47, Beier Road in the middle of the city, and ordered three flower baskets. He wrote the names of Mayor Wu Guozhen, Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian, and Police Bureau Director Yu Shuping on the red ribbons, and asked them to be sent to Qiu Qiu's wedding at the Kang Le Restaurant on the afternoon of the 6th. The price was agreed to be 4 million yuan, discounted to 70%, and Zhu signed a check for 2.8 million yuan from the Juxingcheng Bank. Before leaving, he left the phone number 16130. The next day, when the shop went to Juxingcheng to cash the check, it was returned. The shop manager, Li, asked about it by telephone through the number Zhu left, and learned that there was no such person as Zhu in the Municipal Government. Only then did he realize that he had been deceived. Later, the police station detained Zhu based on the check's record. It was said that his real name was Qiu Degen, and he was the manager of the Metropolitan Theater at No. 427 Changshou Road. He married a woman named Qiu Jinqiu at the Kang Le Restaurant on the 6th of this month. In order to splurge and show off to his relatives and friends, he impersonated others to send flower baskets. Later, the police also took out Qiu's wedding guest book, which showed that in addition to the three flower baskets, there was also a festive banner sent by Finance Minister Wang Yunwu. At the same time, Qiu still owed Kang Le's wedding banquet bill of 150 million yuan, which had not been paid off. The police station considered Qiu to be guilty of fraud and deception, and will transfer him to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning within the next few days.

### Datong Ship Towed to Shanghai, Hull Suffers Seawater Intrusion

[Our Newspaper Reports] The Datong ship has been anchored in Hong Kong for more than a year. Due to its age and disrepair, it is difficult to resume sailing. It has now been sold to a company in this city to dismantle the ship's steel plates for other uses. It was entrusted to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to send the Minsan 302 tugboat to tow it from Hong Kong on the 13th. When it arrived at the Wenzhou sea area the day before yesterday, it was discovered that the ship's hull was taking in about one hour of water every hour. They immediately tried to pump water and increase the speed of the ship. It is reported that they arrived at the Tongsha sea area at the Yangtze River estuary yesterday morning, but the amount of water entering the hull gradually increased, which was extremely dangerous. The tugboat tried its best to rescue it, and it is expected that it can enter the port this morning.

### Robbery Case on Nanjing West Road, Anhui Bandit Gang Arrested

[Our Newspaper Reports] The home of Li Anfa, the owner of the Shengli Cotton Mill at No. 125, Yongyuan Lane, Nanjing West Road, was invaded by four robbers at about 10 PM last night. Li happened to be returning home with a girl. After knocking on the door several times, there was no movement for a long time. Before long, one of the robbers opened the door and dragged Li and the girl into the house. Li, knowing that he had encountered a robbery, shouted for help. The robbers then snatched twenty-six small packages of cotton yarn, a gold ring, and 2 million yuan in cash and fled. After hearing the news, the nearby police station urgently telegraphed the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-bureau, which immediately ordered officers to take several police vehicles and surround the area. At about 11 PM, they intercepted a tricycle at the entrance of No. 504, Panyu Road, which was fully loaded with seventeen packages of stolen cotton yarn. One robber was captured on the spot, and he and the stolen goods were taken to the sub-bureau. According to the robber, Liu Guangyu, based on his confession, other accomplices were arrested and taken to the sub-bureau and a live ammunition handgun and a fake handgun were confiscated at a thatched shed on Hongqiao Road. The remaining cotton yarn, gold ring, and banknotes were also retrieved. According to his confession, the gang were all Anhui bandits, and they had many accomplices and had committed more than eleven robberies. The sub-bureau is currently continuing to pursue them.

### Owner of Chengpu Bag Shop Robbed in Suzhou Residence, Case Solved

[Our Newspaper Reports] Liu Yinkai, 22 years old, from Hunan, who used to be a cook in the Songjiang regiment's district, last winter while working in Songjiang, enticed and abducted Lu Laidi (16 years old), who lived at No. 5, Heqiao Street, Xinximen, Songjiang. On the morning of the 14th of this month, he accompanied the girl to Shanghai and raped her. Lu Yongchang, the girl's father, discovered this, tracked her to Shanghai, and searched everywhere. At about 3 PM the day before yesterday, he found Liu in front of No. 863, Zhongzheng Middle Road, and arrested him. Liu tried to commit suicide by hitting a torch tree next to the road, but failed. The police took him to the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-bureau and handed him over to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on the charge of enticing a girl under the age of twenty to leave her family.

### Shanghai Banking, Money Exchange, and Trust Industries Association Formulates Method for Using Sight Drafts as Collateral, Financial Control Bureau Approves Trial Implementation Today

Since the restriction on the use of checks as collateral, cash payments and receipts by banks have increased sharply, and the issuance of cashier's checks has become frequent. Coupled with limited time and manpower, banks and customers often compete for the first position, losing sight of the other. In view of this, in order to improve and reduce the exchange of cashier's checks, the Shanghai Financial Control Bureau previously instructed the city's Banking, Money Exchange, and Trust Industries Association to formulate a method for customers to use various sight drafts for collection as collateral, taking into account the actual situation of the banks themselves and considering the convenience of factories and industries. The Financial Control Bureau has approved the trial implementation of the method today. The method is recorded below:

(1) For customers who request that deposited drafts be used as collateral on the same day, the banks should carefully investigate their creditworthiness. If they are considered eligible, they should be required to find a reliable guarantor and sign a "Draft Collateral Guarantee Letter" before they can be approved for use as collateral. (2) The banks should copy and report the customer's account name, account number, address, and guarantor's name to the Financial Control Bureau for record. If the bank believes that the customer's credit is poor or there are unstable circumstances, it may report to the Financial Control Bureau to stop their use as collateral at any time. However, once reported, the customer may not apply to restore the use of collateral again. (3) For customers who abuse the issuance of bounced checks, if three returned checks occur consecutively, in addition to reporting to the association as usual, sending a circular to the industry, and stopping transactions with the customer, they should also report the facts to the Financial Control Bureau. Depending on the circumstances, they may be reported to the court, and a public prosecution may be filed according to law. The relevant banks should be responsible for providing evidence. It is expected that the implementation of this method will reduce the circulation of cashier's checks.

### Authorities Did Not Sell Rice Yesterday, Rice is High-Priced but No Goods, Those Holding Goods Are Not Willing to Easily Sell

[Our Newspaper Reports] Rice was high-priced but no goods yesterday. The government still strictly enforces the price limit and did not sell rice yesterday. Although there were bids outside the market, such as 10.56 million yuan per stone, no transactions were made. The supply of goods in the north and south markets was scarce. The south market only had Indica rice, 9.65 million yuan per stone, and the rest were Baiyuan and Yinyuan, and Baijing rice was nowhere to be found. 1,420 stones of rice arrived in the south market, and 1,842 stones of rice arrived in the north market, for a total of 3,262 stones. The reason for the scarce supply is that the price in the production area is higher than in this city, and merchants have no profit to transport rice to Shanghai.

Looking at the rice market yesterday, it seemed that it did not exceed the price limit on the surface, but those holding the goods waited for the opportunity to watch the changes and were unwilling to sell at a low price, resulting in no goods being supplied to the market, creating a situation of external relaxation and internal tension. However, the evening paper yesterday said that the price of rice had risen to 12 million yuan per stone, which, according to Ji Mingzhai, the chief of the Grain Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, was absolutely untrue. The arrival of the first batch of US-aid rice in Shanghai had no major impact on the market price of rice, because the rice was allocated to households and not to the market, but it had a considerable effect on stabilizing people's hearts.

### Wildly Rising Prices of Oil and Grain

Flour

Soaring even more, people are firmly bullish, and cargo owners have no intention of selling, causing prices to jump sharply. The opening price of old vehicle flour outside the market was 3.8 million yuan, and the closing price was 3.9 million yuan. The final price of the warship also reached 3.9 million yuan. The opening prices of Shefeng and Jiancheng were 3.7 million yuan, an increase of 4-500,000 yuan compared to the previous morning. No. 3 yellow vehicle flour was 2.9 million yuan, and there were many transactions of miscellaneous brands. Bran rose by 300,000 yuan, and wheat rose by 500,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Soaring rapidly, Hankou soybeans opened at 6.6 million yuan, and the later market retreated slightly to 6.5 million yuan, an increase of 6-700,000 yuan. Corn rose by 6-700,000 yuan due to the indiscriminate acquisition of corn by the North Gang, regardless of the high price. Only inferior red sorghum was traded, and the price was 5 million yuan. Mung beans rose by 500,000 yuan, and broad beans and barley rose by 5-600,000 yuan each. The Tianjin Gang absorbed sesame, which rose wildly by 3 million yuan. The Guang Gang rushed to buy raw peanuts, which rose rapidly by 4 million yuan.

Cooking Oil

Surging and surging, the momentum of the rise is unprecedented. Soybean oil initially opened at 27 million yuan, rising all the way to 28.5 million yuan, and then falling back to 27.8 million yuan, an increase of 3.67 million yuan. Jittong crude oil was 37.5 million yuan, an increase of 5 million yuan. Raw rapeseed oil rose sharply by 3.56 million yuan, and Xiao Che Ma oil closed at 35 million yuan. Soybean cake rose sharply by 300,000 yuan, and the Changzi Lizi reached the 3 million mark.

[Our Newspaper Reports] The Fook Lai Steamship Company's managed Schneltermack Lan, loaded with US-aid flour, 109,270+ bags by Bodelay Te, was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 22nd of this month. According to a telegram received by the company yesterday, it received an order from its head office to stop coming to Shanghai and unload directly in Tianjin.

### Commercial News from Various Locations

[Our Suzhou Dispatch of the 18th] Prices of all commodities in Suzhou rose today. Due to strict government control over rice prices, trading within the market was suspended. However, black market prices were 9.4 million yuan for inferior unpolished rice and 10.7 million yuan for white rice.

Wuxi

[Our Wuxi Dispatch of the 18th] Commodity prices are soaring universally, and the market situation is extremely chaotic. Trading of oil cakes, flour, and gauze is suspended in various markets, causing widespread anxiety. The government-set price for white rice at the door is 10.5 million yuan.

[Our Jiangyin Dispatch of the 19th] The county government is forcefully suppressing rice prices, forbidding them from exceeding 10 million yuan, but the inflationary trend is difficult to contain. Today, white rice is 12.5 million yuan, and nine-inch gauze is nearing 400 million yuan.

Wuhu

[Our Wuhu Dispatch of the 18th] Machine-milled rice is priced at 12 million yuan, vegetable oil at 7.8 million yuan, silver dollars at 1.2 million yuan, and gold at 120 million yuan.

Xi'an

[Our Xi'an Dispatch of the 18th] The inflationary trend has not stopped, and prices continue to rise. Purple gold in the black market is 130 million yuan per liang (unit of weight), 20-count yarn is 394 million yuan, and wheat is 8 million yuan per shi, about double what it was twenty days ago.

### Brisk Trading of Tea for Domestic Sales

Ever since red and green tea saw a sharp rise the other day, the inflationary trend in the market intensified yesterday. The reason is that large amounts of speculative capital are pouring in, and bills are now being accepted for same-day use, resulting in an increasingly loose and oversupplied market, causing fluctuations in all commodities. Tea prices are rising in unison, leading to repeated price surges. As a result, prices rose even higher than before. Trading is still active and vibrant, with domestic sales tea being continuously sought after by merchants on this street and in rural villages. As for export grades, due to exporters' fear of high prices and limited capacity, transactions were only sporadic.

### Outside Stimulation is Stronger; Chinese Stocks Rise Universally

Yesterday, Chinese stocks faced heavy pressure after three days, and there were many unfavorable obstacles along the way. Although Yongsheng Yarn rose, it was not without twists and turns. Stimulation from outside the market was even stronger, with Guohuo (National Products) hitting the daily limit for the third time, and 14 other stocks, including Meiya, also being forced to rise to the limit.

Yongsheng Yarn opened this morning at 4,110 yuan, and there was still some fluctuation after the opening. Numbers 76 and 68 were first sold at 4,065 yuan, while numbers 164 and others advanced to 4,130 yuan. Numbers 206 and others offered supply, but prices retreated to a low of 4,040 yuan. External forces continued to push the price up, making it difficult to fall back. However, there were frequent struggles due to the brokerage fee being 34 or 38 yuan at the original price, which had to be borne for three days. Police officers were still patrolling, and there were fluctuations of 20 to 30 yuan. Despite this, yarn and cloth prices skyrocketed, and credit became even more abundant. By the afternoon close, the price had risen to 4,230 yuan. Ten stocks, including Guohuo, Xinnuo, Meiya, Jingfeng, Hengfeng, and Datong, had all hit the daily limit. Compared to the previous day, Xinyi rose slightly, Yongsheng Yarn, Huaxin, Xinguang, and Jingfu rose by half a percent, Zhongfa, Hengda, Meiya, Xinnuo, Datong, Rongfeng, and Match rose to the limit, and other stocks rose by 10% to 15%.

In the after-market, due to rumors of unfavorable news in the evening papers, there was panic. Yongsheng Yarn opened at 4,300 yuan, and there was selling and buying, fluctuating for a long time around 4,300 yuan. The National Bank made limited progress, with numbers 52 and 169 reaching a new high of 4,345 yuan. Guohuo and 14 other stocks were still forced to rise to the limit. Rumors spread that the entire market would close for a month. By the close, the price had retreated to 4,265 yuan, and the closing price was 4,270 yuan. Compared to the morning close, Guohuo and nine other stocks rose to the limit, Qinxing was flat, Zhongfa fell by half a percent, Jingfu, Xinguang, Huaxin, Jinglun, and Xinhua declined slightly, and the rest rose slightly. Unlisted stocks outside the market continued to advance, and bank stocks, cultural stocks, public utility stocks, and Yidasheng were even more popular.

### Active Buyers Seeking More Than Supply; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Rise Again

Large buyers frequently came to purchase, and the market was filled with calls to buy. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened in the morning and continued to rise by 30 million yuan. Later, as cloth prices surged, buyers on this street became active, and the market showed a situation where demand exceeded supply. Prices soared to a peak of 630 million yuan. By the close, retail investors took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the price ended at 610 million yuan, a further increase of 40 million yuan from the previous day. The prices of other counts of fine yarn also rose by 30 to 60 million yuan.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was extremely active. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened flat, but surged to 13.05 million yuan by 11:00 AM. Later, the rise was slightly dampened by the Spinning and Weaving Company's sale of fine cloth. The market closed at 12.95 million yuan, a further surge of 1.6 million yuan from the previous day. The prices of other cloths also rose sharply in unison.

### Silk Soars Suddenly

The rayon market continued to soar yesterday. 120-count Jin San Ma (Golden Three Horses) bright rayon opened in the morning at 660 million yuan, and there were transactions.

Finally, C-grade silk was trading at 870 million yuan, D-grade at 60 million yuan, and high-grade silk at around 50 million yuan. The dried silk market was quite quiet, but prices also rose yesterday. High-grade silk was quoted at 670 million yuan.

Silk Loan prices hit new highs yesterday. Huaqiang pure silk quilt covers rose to 344 million yuan in the morning and then rose to 350 million yuan in the afternoon. There were very few orders for Jiangzibi crepe, but demand was still high, so the afternoon quotation was within 1.4 million yuan.

### Woolen Fabrics are Popular

Woolen fabrics and wool products have been the most popular recently. The market is strong both internally and externally. In addition to recent bills, crossed checks are not accepted, and buyers must generally accommodate sellers. Most large stores are unwilling to sell easily, and the popularity is unprecedented.

Yesterday, the exchange of bills between silver and money shops showed a difference of 798.1 billion yuan between the four banks and two bureaus. The money market was relatively stable.

The agricultural production increase loan for this year was originally scheduled to end in mid-June, but due to continued high demand from farmers in various regions, it has been decided to extend it to the end of this month.

### World Cup Basketball Team Arrives in Shanghai; Wins First Match Easily Against Dongxing; Will Play Against Renyu Again Tonight; Will Take Night Train to Beijing After the Game and Come Back Tomorrow Night

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Our World Cup basketball team and track and field athletes Huang Liangzheng and Chen Yinglang, led by Jiang Lianggui and Song Junfu, arrived here by train the night before last, arrived at the Dadong Hotel at 7:50 AM yesterday, and played against Dongxing that night at the gymnasium. At 8:00 PM today, they will compete against Renyu at the same location, and will take the night train to leave Shanghai to participate in the President's Flag Presentation Ceremony held in Beijing tomorrow, and then leave Beijing again that night to come to Shanghai. The originally scheduled three games here have been increased to four due to Encas's request to fight against the World Cup team. The order of the other three games is arranged as follows:

[19th] vs. Renyu, 8:00 PM, referees Wu Zibin and Zhu Mingxing [21st] vs. Encas, 7:30 PM [22nd] vs. Dagong, 7:30 PM

In addition to the old team, Renyu has recently recruited new players such as Le Jiazhou and Zhuang Yirong, making their strength even stronger.

### Small Victory Over Dongxing; Disappointing Performance

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The World Cup basketball team won their first game last night with a small victory of 57 to 42 over Dongxing. In the first half, they were only leading by two points, 26 to 24. The World Cup team lacked coordination and had poor communication. The performance did not reach the standard, and the audience was disappointed. In the end, they won due to their higher individual skills. Dongxing committed too many fouls, and their tactics were still poor. It is hoped that the World Cup will improve in their second game against Renyu tonight.

The game started at 7:30 PM. The World Cup team appeared in white vests with national emblems on their chests. Cai Wenhua, Li Shiqiao, Wu Chengzhang, Bao Songyuan, and Fei Tianxi were in the starting lineup. Dongxing started with Wang Chengfang, Tian Fuhai, Wei Qikun, Cao Zhiji, and Zhang Zhidong.

After a stalemate for several minutes, the score was tied at eight. The World Cup gradually exceeded, reaching 17 to 12. Zhongqiang replaced "Adi." Dongxing fought hard and quickly scored six points, and the situation became tense. Dongxing was only behind by one point, 24 to 26, in the first half.

The second half started, and the World Cup replaced Zhongqiang with Yu Jin. Dongxing's Cao Zhiji made a sneak attack, forcing a tie. The World Cup then rallied, shooting and scoring consecutively. Dongxing made frequent substitutions but still had no chance. The World Cup's situation gradually stabilized. After 37 to 30, Cai Zhongqiang re-entered, and Jia Zhijun, Qian Ruizhang, and captain Li Zhenzhong entered the game. Dongxing's Cao Zhiji committed five fouls and was sent off. Zhang Pu replaced him. When the score was 47 to 37, Wei Qikun was also fouled five times and was sent off. Yu Ruizhang scored a free throw and added seven points. Dongxing made frequent mistakes.

Chairman Yu Hengzhi first reported: "During the Donghua Qingbai Mayor's Cup final on the 13th of this month, an incident of assaulting a referee occurred, and we received a protest letter from the Donghua team. This should be discussed." Referee Jiang Yin then reported: "In the Donghua Qingbai Mayor's Cup final, I was the referee. The first half ended in a 1-1 tie. Fifteen minutes into the second half, Donghua's Jia Youliang committed a foul, resulting in a free kick, which Qingbai scored, making it 2-1. After the kickoff, a Donghua defender fouled again. When another free kick was about to be taken, Donghua player Hanni Bo hurled English insults at me and, without asking why, punched me in the face twice. Despite being insulted, I restrained myself and ordered Hanni Bo off the field to continue the game. However, Hanni Bo refused to comply. I then told Donghua team captain Li to order Hanni Bo off the field. Captain Li then stated that Hanni Bo had been ordered off the field and Donghua was willing to forfeit the match. At this point, the match could not continue, so I blew the whistle to end it." After the report, discussions were held, and the following resolutions were passed:

(1) Hanni Bo's assault and insult of the referee is a violation of sportsmanship. He is permanently suspended from participating in all future matches organized by this association. (2) The Donghua team's disrespect for the referee's decision is a violation of the spirit of sports. The match is ruled as a forfeit by the Donghua team. (3) The statement issued by the administrative department on the evening of the 13th regarding the match incident is ratified. (4) Based on the above rulings, the Donghua team's protest regarding the match incident and game time is rejected.

### Annotations and Verifications of Jiaxuan's Ci Poetry (1)

— Deng Guangming

Feeling the Emperor's Grace

In Celebration of Vice Prefect Fan's Birthday

Rare is seventy years since ancient times; everyone says, "How could it be achieved without merits accumulated in secret?" Although the pine's posture is slender, it particularly withstands snow, cold, frost, and dew. Look at the depths of your temples, full of youthful vibrancy.

The snow on the building has just cleared, laughter and merriment fill the courtyard. Why not indulge in a drunken revelry? From now on, enjoy health and longevity, without need for elixirs or magic herbs. You will live to a hundred, defying the aging process.

Again

Celebrating Vice Prefect Fan's Birthday in Chuzhou

The beauty of spring arrives with Qingming, a profusion of flowers and willows. Let the music and song persuade you to drink wine. The wine is as good as spring; the colors of spring remain the same year after year. Youth never ages, do you know that?

Looking at you during the banquet, as refined and upright as bamboo and pine. May youth stay with you for a long time. On the path home to the Three Mountains, tomorrow the fragrance of the heavens will adorn your sleeves. Let's raise our golden cups again to wish you a long life.

The above two poems were both written to celebrate Vice Prefect Fan's birthday. The location of the first poem is not specified, while the second poem was written in Chuzhou, presumably during Jiaxuan's tenure as Prefect of Xuzhou. The full name of Vice Prefect Fan is not indicated in the titles of the poems. Now, "Vice Prefect" is an abbreviation for Vice Magistrate, and according to Jiaxuan's history, among his early friends or colleagues named Fan who served as Vice Magistrates, at least two can be found: one is Fan Ang, who served as Acting Vice Magistrate of Xuzhou from 1170 to 1172 during the reign of Emperor Xiaozong of the Song Dynasty, as seen in the records of the Xuzhou Prefectural Gazette's section on Vice Magistrates and the Department of Merit Evaluation in the Draft of the Important Documents of the Song Dynasty; the other is Jiaxuan's father-in-law, Fan Bangyan, who returned to the Song from the Jin in 1161 during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty. The Records of Zhenjiang in Zhishun says:

"Fan Bangyan, courtesy name Ganmei, was from Tangshan, Xingzhou. He was a student of the Imperial Academy during the Xuanhe era. At the end of the Jingkang era, Xingzhou was captured, and he entered the Jin. He passed the local examination and served as the magistrate of Xixin County in Caizhou. During the Shaoxing era, he led his people to open Caizhou to welcome the Song army, then went south to Run. He was granted the position of Registrar of Huzhou, promoted to Prefect of Tongzhou, and died in office at the age of seventy-four."

Mu's Collection from Lingyang includes an article titled "Writing at the Home of Fan Lei Qing," which contains a passage about Fan Bangyan:

"Lord Fan Lei Qing,... his fourth ancestor was known as the Mengchang of Hebei. During the Jingkang Rebellion, he was able to preserve his clan, taking care of the poor and aiding the distressed, showing complete faith and righteousness. He passed the Jinshi examination and became the magistrate of Xixin County in Caizhou. In the tenth month of the Xinyi year of the Shaoxing era, he led his county to return [to the Song].... He should have been granted an extraordinary promotion as encouragement, but was only made Assistant Magistrate of Changxing County in Huzhou, wearing scarlet robes and a silver fish, not fully in accordance with regulations? ... He was then changed to Secretary of the Zhenjiang Military Prefecture in charge of official matters, summoned to the capital for review, and appointed Vice Prefect of the prefecture until he died in office.... The Lord and Lord Xin Qiji returned one after the other, knowing each other for their loyalty and righteousness. Lord Xin then married the Lord's daughter. The Lord was aware of the times. Lord Chen Junqing and Lord Wang Yan all knew the Lord, but the Lord was old and not ultimately employed, placing his hopes in the future.... Alas, the Lord was ill-fated."

Although the locations where Fan Bangyan served as Secretary and Vice Prefect differ in these two accounts, both books agree that Fan did indeed serve as Vice Prefect and died in office. If we were to choose between the two accounts, I would prefer to rely on Mu’s account, as it is based on Fan’s family genealogy.

Is the Vice Prefect Fan in the titles of these two "Feeling the Emperor's Grace" poems Fan Bangyan? Or is it Fan Ang? Is the Vice Prefect Fan in the first poem Bangyan, while the Vice Prefect of Chuzhou is Fan Ang?

Judging from the scenery described in the two poems, one was written on a day when "the snow on the building had just cleared," while the other was written during the "profusion of flowers and willows" of Qingming. The timing seems inconsistent. Therefore, I initially believed that the Vice Prefect Fan in these two poems must not refer to the same person. The one born around Qingming must be Fan Ang (because this poem was written in Chuzhou), and the one born on the day when "the snow on the building had just cleared" must be Fan Bangyan. From the time I began compiling Jiaxuan's chronological biography to the day I finished writing "A Study of Jiaxuan's Social Circle," I had always held this view. However, recently, while reviewing old works, I felt that this view should be revised: both of these "Feeling the Emperor's Grace" poems must have been written for Fan Bangyan. The reasons are:

First, one of the poems contains the line "Looking at you during the banquet, as refined and upright as bamboo and pine," while the other contains the line "Although the pine's posture is slender." If the Vice Prefect Fan in these two poems were not the same person, it is unlikely that both of them would happen to have a refined and slender physique.

Second, after Fan Bangyan returned to the Song, he resided in Zhenjiang, and the poem "Celebrating Vice Prefect Fan's Birthday in Chuzhou" contains the line "On the path home to the Three Mountains," which refers to the Golden Mountain, Jiao Mountain, and North Gu Mountain in Zhenjiang. Fan Ang, who served as Vice Prefect in Chuzhou, would not have also happened to be a resident of Zhenjiang.

Third, during the Southern Song Dynasty, the winter solstice usually fell on December 14th or 15th in the Western calendar. Based on this, the Qingming Festival would fall within the second or third month of the Chinese calendar. If someone was born at the end of the second month or the beginning of the third month, the celebration of their birthday in a particular year might be after the Qingming Festival, while in another year, it might be before Qingming. Furthermore, after the "profusion of flowers and willows" of Qingming, it could still snow in the Jianghuai region. For example, in the fourth year of the Qiandao era, Qingming should have fallen on the seventeenth day of the second month, but the Records of the Five Elements in the History of the Song Dynasty records a heavy snowfall on the Gui Chou day of the twentieth day of the second month of that year. Although the location is not specified, it presumably refers to the Jiangzhe region, the heartland of the Southern Song Dynasty. Therefore, although the scenery described in these two "Feeling the Emperor's Grace" poems differs slightly, we can reasonably conclude that they were both written to celebrate the birthday of Fan Bangyan.

Mu's article mentions that when Fan Bangyan was "summoned to the capital for review" in his later years, he was greatly appreciated by Chen Junqing and Wang Yan. In the Song Dynasty, it was common practice that anyone summoned to the capital for review would be examined by the Prime Minister or the Associate Administrator. Since Fan Bangyan was recognized by Chen Junqing and Wang Yan as a result of his review, it means that Fan was reviewed during the time when Chen and Wang were serving as Prime Ministers. According to Xu Ziming's Chronological Record of Prime Ministers of the Song Dynasty, Chen Junqing was appointed Associate Administrator in the eleventh month of the third year of the Qiandao era and was appointed Grand Master of Rectitude, Right Assistant Administrator, and Co-Minister of Affairs in the tenth month of the fourth year. He was dismissed as Prime Minister in the fifth month of the sixth year and sent out to govern Fuzhou. Wang Yan was appointed Academician of the Duanming Hall, Assistant Administrator of the Secretariat-Chancellery, and Acting Associate Administrator in the second month of the fourth year of the Qiandao era. He was appointed Associate Administrator and concurrently in charge of national expenditures in the second month of the fifth year, and in the third month, he was sent out as Pacification Commissioner of Sichuan with the title of Grand Master of the Left, still serving as Associate Administrator. Therefore, the period when Chen and Wang both served as ministers in the court was from the second month of the fourth year to the third month of the fifth year of the Qiandao era. It follows that Fan's summons for review must have occurred no later than the spring of the fifth year of the Qiandao era. After the review, he was appointed Vice Prefect of Zhenjiang, and he died in office before he could be replaced, so Fan must have died no later than the ninth year of the Qiandao era. The Southern Song Dynasty mostly used upright officials as acting Vice Prefects, and it was generally stipulated that they "should not handle official duties." Because they did not handle official duties, they could leave their posts and travel far. It is likely that Jiaxuan had already formed a close relationship with Fan's family at that time, so Fan accompanied him to Huai at the beginning of Jiaxuan's mourning period in the eighth year of the Qiandao era. Since his visit to Huai was only for sightseeing and he held no official position, he could return to his post at any time, so Jiaxuan's birthday poem contains the line "On the path home to the Three Mountains, tomorrow the fragrance of the heavens will adorn your sleeves." In fact, Fan stayed in Xuzhou for a long time before leaving. At that time, Jiaxuan also wrote a "Magnolia Flower Slow" to see him off, which contains the line "Counting the days until Mid-Autumn, the full moon is beautiful, but it does not illuminate a reunion," indicating that it was early autumn.

Based on the above reasoning, Fan's death must have occurred before the ninth year of the Qiandao era, so it must have been shortly after returning to Zhenjiang from Xuzhou, either in the autumn or winter. At that time, Fan was seventy-four years old. If the poem "Rare is seventy years since ancient times" was written in the year Fan turned seventy, it would have been in the spring of the fourth year of the Qiandao era, making it one of the earliest of Jiaxuan's poems whose writing year can be determined.

### Distinguishing Errors in Zou Hanxun's "Treatise on the Five Tones"

— Zhou Zumo

In the Qing Dynasty, there were two scholars who were well-versed in phonology and known as masters of rhyme tables: Jiang Yong and Chen Li. Jiang's "Distinguishing Subtle Points in Phonology" and "Table of Initial Consonants and Rhymes for the Four Tones" and Chen's "Outer Chapters of Examination of Initial Consonants and Rhymes" are both works on rhyme tables. However, Jiang blindly adhered to the Song scholars' theory of initial consonants and failed to understand its merits and demerits, while Chen could understand its merits and demerits but could not integrate it with the rhyme books. These were their shortcomings. However, the achievements of both are already remarkable. Zou's book is far inferior to the erudition of these two scholars. It is full of views that are biased towards local dialects, without considering the origins and development and confusing ancient and modern.

The book is divided into two volumes, upper and lower. The upper volume discusses the five tones and the twenty initial consonants; the lower volume discusses the eight opening divisions and the fifteen rhyme categories. In discussing the five tones, he mixes them with the four tones, saying, "The five tones are yin, yang, rising, departing, and entering. Sharp yang are shang and jiao, departing and entering are zhi and yu, rising is gong. The Han Shu says: 'Tone is rising gong, gong is supreme,' and it is the framework for the four tones, so it can rise from below and is called rising" (see section on the Five Tones Inherent in the Four Tones). This is similar to Li Jiedong of the Northern Qi Dynasty's "Resolving Doubts in Phonology," which associates the names of ancient musical scales with the four tones of spoken language, claiming that "gong and shang are level, zhi is rising, yu is departing, and jiao is entering" (see "Citations from Liu Shan Jing's Discourse on the Four Tones" in "Mirror of Literature and Secret Cabinet"), which is baseless. In ancient times, characters had distinctions in tone but not the names of level, rising, departing, and entering. Therefore, the five tones of gong, shang, jiao, zhi, and yu were used to refer to them, which was originally a borrowed usage, as Chen Lanfu's "Examination of Initial Consonants and Rhymes" has already stated. It is not appropriate to force an association. Zou then confuses the old theories since the Sui and Tang Dynasties, making strained analogies and creating additional errors. The five tones and four tones were originally two different matters, as Shen Yue once said in his letter to Zhen Sibai, the Governor of Dingzhou in the Wei Dynasty. He said:

"The classics and historical records only have five tones and no four tones. So how does the use of four tones harm the five tones? The five tones are gong, shang, jiao, zhi, and yu, which correspond to each other above and below, and the musical sounds are harmonious. If the five relationships of ruler, minister, people, affairs, and things are in harmony, then the country will be well-governed. Those who write five-character poems, if they are good at using the four tones, will be able to create flowing and beautiful recitations and achieve the eight styles, creating splendid and elegant works. Each has its own use and does not interfere with the others." (also see "Discourse on the Four Tones")

This is truly an insightful statement. Furthermore, the division of yin and yang in character sounds is a modern theory. The names of yin and yang as tone categories were created by Yuan Dynasty song and rhyme scholars. Originally, the initial consonants of character sounds had distinctions between clear and muddy, but in later dialects, the initial consonants sometimes did not distinguish between clear and muddy, but the tones had differences between yin and yang. Yin and yang and clear and muddy are originally two different matters. The meaning of yin and yang is also originally not specific. For characters whose initial consonant is a clear consonant, the tone that is read is called the yin tone; for characters whose initial consonant is a muddy consonant, the tone that is read is called the yang tone. This is the case for the level tone, and the same applies to the rising, departing, and entering tones. However, in some dialects, the rising, departing, and entering tones may not distinguish between yin and yang, but this is not always the case. Zou then associates the yin and yang of the level tone with shang and jiao, so what will he do with the yin and yang of the rising and departing tones? Furthermore, because his Xinhua dialect does not distinguish between yin and yang in the rising and departing tones, he claims that the rising and departing tones do not have shang sounds. This is an example of studying local dialects without considering the origins and development.

As for the categories of the twenty initial consonants, they are Zou's deletions and combinations of the theory of initial consonants. He believes that many of the Song scholars' initial consonants are repeated, so he combines xiao with xia, combines qun with xi, combines ding with tou, combines ni with lai, combines yu with ying, combines zhi with zhao, combines che, cheng, and chuang with chuan, combines niang, ri, and chan with shen, combines cong with qing, combines xie with xin, combines bing with pang, and combines feng with fu. Thirty-six initials are combined into sixteen, so there are twenty. However, these are all Zou's own local dialects, how can he use them to discuss ancient people! To say that the ancient sounds of shen and qun should be combined with xiao, that xie should be combined with xu, and that the ancient xu and yi consonants should be read lightly is even more absurd and unreasonable. As for discussing the five tones of the tongue, teeth, throat, etc., he says that the teeth originally have no sound, and their sound is actually the sound of the throat, tongue, teeth, and other sounds. The reason why there is a dental sound in the five tones mentioned by previous people is a general term, not the primary function of one organ. This is again misled by the method of five-tone analysis of characters at the end of Guangyun and the theory of five-tone sounds at the end of the chapter. The method of five-tone analysis of characters uses ga as a dental sound and wang ming as a throat sound. Ga is the jian initial consonant, and gang ge is also the jian initial consonant. The theory of five-tone sounds uses he wo gang e ke kang ge as throat sounds and geng ying ya ge xing xing heng ke as dental sounds. Among them, he is the xia initial consonant, and xing xing is also the xia initial consonant; wo e is the yi initial consonant, and ying ya is also the yi initial consonant; gang diao ge is the jian initial consonant, and geng ge is also the jian initial consonant; kang is the xi initial consonant, and ke is also the xi initial consonant. The boundary between the dental and throat sounds seems to be indistinguishable, so Zou claims that the dental sound is an empty name. If we analyze it carefully, the jade chapter's five-tone sound explanation places first-degree characters in the throat sound and second-degree characters in the teeth sound, and their pronunciations seem to be different, but they are actually not the same type.

Furthermore, the five tones of tongue, teeth, throat, etc., come from the Sanskrit Siddham chapter. The script of Sanskrit is broadly divided into two categories: one is Pīta sound, and the other is atīta sound. Pīta sound is named because it is compared in fives, and all the sounds are consonants produced by exhaling air and touching the mouth, which are controlled by the organs of the mouth. Atīta sound is also called a vowel sound, which is a type of semi-vowel and fricative. Because its sound originates from the throat and fills the mouth, it is also called the sound that fills the mouth. Pīta sounds are divided into five categories according to the different positions of the mouth in producing the sound, which are the so-called five tones. The first category is the ancient root sounds k, kh, g, gh, ng, which are the kind of sounds corresponding to Middle Chinese jian, xi, qun, and yi. The names of these sounds according to Sanskrit grammarians also do not agree with each other. Pratiakbyas calls it the radical sound of the tongue, or translates it as the basic sound of the tongue, or dental sound; Panini calls it the throat sound, or translates it as the middle sound of the throat. However, from the Six Dynasties to the Sui and Tang Dynasties, the Sanskrit monks who came to China were either from Central India or from Southern India, and their languages differed from each other. The throat and teeth were originally one category, but the pronunciation in the dialects was either a throat sound or a dental sound. Therefore, the schools that transmitted Siddham in China also differed. The names of the five tones have their own explanations. (To be continued)

### Regarding the Problem of the "" Character in the Stone Drums - An Open Letter to the Editors of Literature and History

— Tang Lan

To the Editors:

Regarding the problem of the "遊" character in the Stone Drums, I received today from the Shanghai Museum the 85th issue of Cultural Relics, which contains Mr. Tong Shuye's article "A Critique of Mr. Tang Lan's Three Doubts about the Use of Characters in the Stone Drums." After reading it, I deeply feel that if two people's thinking and methods are different, they cannot discuss a problem together. For example, I recently only raised the point that the Stone Drums have "" but not "朕" as a basis for the statement "The Stone Drums are definitely not before Duke Jing but after Duke Jing and before the Cursing Chu Texts." First, determine whether this argument is correct or incorrect, and then talk about other things. When talking about other things, there will naturally be other evidence. When I discuss with Mr. Tong, I always want to focus on a preliminary question without digressing. This kind of discussion should be "decisive" and limited to one point without expanding it. This is my method of discussion. Now, Mr. Tong says that I use this point to determine that it was carved in the third year of Duke Ling of Qin, which is not in line with my method. What connection do "" and Duke Ling of Qin have? How can I connect them directly? Mr. Tong has not yet understood my method of discussion, so we do not have a common starting point.

Also, Mr. Tong cites Jiri Jian's "朕余" and Shen Zi Meng's "朕吾." Without discussing whether Jiri Jian's era and Shen Zi Meng's "吾" character are credible, simply "朕余" and "朕吾" are not casually used in my method to replace "朕" or "吾." Their nature, without detailed study, is unknown to me, and it is my method to admit ignorance.

者 according to my knowledge should be read as "dong," not "dong." This is when Prince Yu of Yue went to Ying, Yue Shijia wrote as 與夷, (the Yue Chunqiu mistook 與 for 興). The nineteenth year is the nineteenth year of Goujian, after the capture of the unicorn. Mr. Guo Moruo believes that 諸咎 is wrong. We have seen many bronzes with 諸咎, without a doubt, it came before them. There, there is the word 朕, which does not contradict my saying that the word 朕 disappeared and the word 吾 became popular between the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, although Yue culture in different regions may be more conservative. However, after the capture of the unicorn, it can be considered the Warring States period. Mr. Tong may also say that the word 朕 also existed in the Warring States period and that my saying "between the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods" is "baseless."

The main issue is time and region. Marquis Qi Hou has "朕" but not "" and "" has "" but not "朕." The region is the same, so I believe that the time is different. Marquis Qi Hou is earlier, and "" is later. In the Zhai script, I say that Duke Zhai with the word "朕" is earlier and the Stone Drums with the word "避" are later. This is the same argument. If I misjudge the era of Qin, then that of Qi must also be wrong, because my method is consistent. We may be mistaken about a certain point, and if we are wrong, I am willing to admit it. Only the method cannot be wrong.

But what about Mr. Tong? He says that there are drums in the early Spring and Autumn period, of course, much earlier than Duke Tai of Qin. But in "", he says it is "not far" from Marquis Qi Hou in the time of Duke Jing of Qi. This is a vague statement. Is it earlier? Or later? He says that the era cannot be determined, but he bases it on the 縣 of Marquis Qi Hou and the 邑 of "", saying that the systems are similar. Therefore, he raises another question: "Is it that the use of characters by the people of Qi changed suddenly during this period?" From this, we can know that Mr. Tong also knows that this "difference" is "later," he is just avoiding saying the word "later." Perhaps my thinking is wrong, but I always feel that at this important juncture, at the very least, the right and wrong must be clarified. It should not be "evasive." Since he feels it is later, then it should be frankly later, why say "not far"? What we need to determine is only the order: is the "" character earlier? Or is the "朕" character earlier? This is an important dividing line. How far is a separate matter, and whether there is a sudden change in a short period is also a separate matter. All theories, put them away first, please come to the historical facts. If in fact it has changed suddenly, can we say that the time is too short to allow a sudden change?

In short, according to Mr. Tong Shuye, the use of the character "" in the Stone Drums is much earlier than Duke Mu of Qin who used the word "朕," but the Marquis Qi Hou of the time of Duke Ling of Qi, who was contemporary to Duke Jing of Qin and used the word "朕," is reversed to be before the "" of "". In my method, this is contradictory and absolutely cannot be allowed.

As Mr. Tong said, the Book of Songs uses the word "朕" very little. This may prove that after the end of the Western Zhou Dynasty, the word "朕" gradually lost its momentum in living language, while bronze inscriptions are more conservative, so it was still used in the Spring and Autumn period. But in the same region, there must be a distinction between the "" and "" of Chu who used "吾." Is "朕" earlier? Or are "吾" and "" earlier? What I want to discuss is only this point. Mr. Tong actually admits that the word "朕" is naturally more ancient, which we can agree with 100%, but he still says that the Stone Drums use the character "" in the early Eastern Zhou period, much earlier than Duke Mu of Qin who used the word "朕." This is what we do not understand.

The Book of Songs uses "我" and "余" but not "朕" and "吾." Mr. Tong believes that "朕" is an ancient word, but the Stone Drums use "", "我," and "余" but not "朕" because there is "no need to use 朕." I don't know how Mr. Tong thought of this kind of contradictory statement? Mr. Tong tells us that the Book of Songs' Guofeng does not use the word "朕," so we cannot say it is a work of the Warring States period, so the Stone Drums not using the word "朕" cannot be said to be Warring States. But what about the "吾" character? The Book of Songs has the word "我," but not the word "吾." The Stone Drums have the character "", and also the character "我," and changed "我車旣攻" to "車旣工." Is "吾" earlier than "", and the Stone Drums are still before the Guofeng? Or is the word "吾" newer than the words "我" and "余" and occurred after the Guofeng?

As the saying goes: "Things don't happen more than three times." I have already discussed this issue twice, this is the third time. Further replies will be nothing more than these words, and it will never depart from my old method. Saying more nonsense only wastes your precious space. The truth will one day be proven. Now, since the thinking is different and the methods are different, further discussion will only lead to "the last speaker winning," and there will be no conclusion. Although I am afraid that people will misunderstand my original intention, I am also very afraid that I will misunderstand other people's meanings, and I also hope that Mr. Tong can slowly justify himself, so I have decided to stop here and make this statement that I will not discuss it any further.

Finally, thank you for your kindness in publishing these nonsense words several times.
