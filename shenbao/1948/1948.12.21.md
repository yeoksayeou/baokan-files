### Sun Ke Announces Continuation of Efforts, Until Honorable and Peaceful Resolution is Achieved; New Cabinet to Hold First Meeting Tomorrow

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] Following his acceptance of the mandate to form a cabinet, Sun Ke hosted foreign reporters at his official residence in the Mausoleum area at 6:30 PM on the 20th, formally announcing the new cabinet's policies and the names of some of its members. Sun conferred with Wang Chonghui and Wu Tiecheng again on the list of cabinet members before receiving the foreign reporters in his exquisite study. Madame Sun accompanied him. Sun was in good spirits and gave a brief report in fluent English, answering reporters' questions for about five minutes before leaving. Sun stated: "Having been entrusted with the mandate to form a cabinet, I have decided to proceed after consultations with various parties. The future cabinet will incorporate opinions from both within and outside the Party. The Kuomintang will adhere to its consistent principles and hopes for cooperation from all quarters. This cabinet is a combat cabinet and will continue fighting until an honorable peace is achieved." The full list of cabinet members has been finalized and will be reported to the President for release on the 21st. For now, I can inform you that the Vice-President will be Mr. Wu Tiecheng. The position of Foreign Minister was initially offered to Dr. Hu Shih, but he repeatedly declined. It has now been decided that Vice-President Wu will temporarily hold the position concurrently. Those entering the cabinet from within include Weng Wenhao, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and Chen Lifu, all as political councilors, to jointly discuss major national policies." A foreign reporter asked, "Will the new cabinet surrender to the Communists?" Sun replied firmly, "Surrender? Absolutely not!" Sun also stated, "We do not intend to surrender to the Communists. Surrendering to the Communists would make China a second Poland or Czechoslovakia." During the Q&A session, Sun hinted that a compromise with the Communists was not impossible. However, he emphasized that both sides must be sincere for a compromise to be reached, implying that the Communists had repeatedly refused to negotiate with the government. With that, the reception concluded. Since Sun began forming the cabinet, he has primarily targeted foreign reporters in Nanjing and Shanghai, leading some to believe that the Sun cabinet places emphasis on international relations and diplomacy.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The new Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, issued a brief statement at a press conference held at his residence on the evening of the 20th, stating that the selection of new cabinet members after five or six days of discussions, was finally completed on the evening of the 20th. The list will be submitted to the President for review on the evening of the 20th, and will be officially released on the 21st. He originally intended to invite people from all parties inside and outside the Kuomintang to participate in the cabinet as much as possible, but regrettably, some people did not accept the invitation, such as Dr. Hu Shih. He originally intended to invite him to be the Minister of Foreign Affairs, but it didn’t work out. The post of Foreign Minister will now be temporarily held concurrently by Wu Tiecheng, the proposed Vice-President. Sun then announced that Zhang Qun, Weng Wenhao, Chen Lifu, and Zhang Zhizhong had all agreed to participate in the new cabinet. A foreign reporter asked Sun if the new cabinet would "continue its campaign to suppress the Communists." Sun replied, "The government will continue to fight the bandits until a victorious peace is achieved." Another reporter then asked, "Is there any possibility of the government surrendering to the Communists?" Sun was surprised to hear this, and immediately declared in a solemn tone that this was absolutely impossible, and the repetition of Poland and Czechoslovakia should be taken as a warning. Finally, a foreign reporter asked again, "Then what is the possibility of compromise?" Sun immediately replied emphatically that the government is determined to suppress bandits and will never compromise lightly. After the end of the press conference, Premier Sun drove to the President's residence to submit the new cabinet list.

### New Cabinet List to Be Announced Today; Wu Tiecheng Temporarily Concurrently Foreign Minister; Zhang Qun, Chen Lifu, Zhang Zhizhong, and Others to Serve as Political Councilors

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] Sun Ke's cabinet, after four days of preparation, was finally formed on the 20th. After formally announcing this matter to foreign reporters at 6:30 PM, Sun took the list of his cabinet members to see the President, requesting approval. It is scheduled to be submitted to the Kuomintang Central Political Committee for approval and announced on the 21st, and then officially take office on a scheduled date. Sun's cabinet formation had gone through several difficulties. The last three days were especially crucial to its success or failure. Sun insisted on establishing a "cabinet of heavyweights," but after he repeatedly invited various heavyweights in Shanghai and Nanjing, and they all declined, he gradually became discouraged. He intended to resign the mandate of forming the cabinet to the President, but the President comforted him and instructed Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, and others to fully assist him. On the evening of the 19th, the heavyweights rushed around to discuss separately, and on the morning of the 20th, they also jointly saw the President, and an agreement was reached. This difficult-to-produce Sun Ke cabinet was formed with the invitation of the Kuomintang heavyweights to join the cabinet. Sun's plan to invite the heavyweights to participate has now almost all been fulfilled. In addition to Wu Tiecheng serving as Vice-President and temporarily concurrently holding the position of Foreign Minister, Zhang Qun, Chen Lifu, Zhang Zhizhong, and Weng Wenhao all serve as political councilors without concurrently holding ministerial positions, fulfilling their responsibility of assistance. According to sources, the other ministers are: Finance Minister Xu Kan will continue to serve, and other possible changes include Minister of Industry and Commerce Liu Weizhi, Minister of National Defense Yu Dawei, Minister of Social Affairs Zhong Tianxin, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Chen Ce, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission Bai Yunti, Director of the Information Bureau Shen Changhuan. The Ministry of Education and the National Resources Commission may not change. Minister of Interior Peng Zhaoxian and Minister of Justice Xie Guansheng have expressed their firm resignations. The Minister of Agriculture and Forestry may still be a member of the Youth Party and will not be changed. As for the political councilors of the Democratic and Youth Parties, it is not yet known whether there will be any changes. It was previously decided that the Secretary-General would be Wu Shangying, and Zuo Gong would be the Deputy Secretary-General. It is now known that this has changed and it is possible that Li Weiguo will continue to serve, and some say that Duan Benkai may be appointed Secretary-General. The new cabinet list will be announced on the 21st, and the first political affairs meeting will be held on the 22nd.

### Sun Ke Answers Questions from Foreign Reporters

[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] Sun Ke recently announced the formation of a "wartime cabinet," which may conduct peace talks with the Communists under the conditions of "honorable peace." Sun stated: His cabinet will never surrender to the Communists but will fight the Communists until achieving "honorable peace." Sun was ordered to form a cabinet three weeks ago and formally announced the establishment of his cabinet organization at a press conference on the evening of the 20th. He also made a surprising statement that the National Government is now willing to conduct peace talks with the Communists. When asked, "What are the conditions for a peaceful resolution?" Sun replied, "This point must be discussed and decided later." Sun said that the new cabinet list will be submitted to the President for approval on the night of the 20th and will be announced on the 21st, but he revealed that the list includes Wu Tiecheng as Vice-President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs. Sun also stated: Zhang Qun, Chen Lifu, Zhang Zhizhong, Weng Wenhao, etc., will all be cabinet members who decide policies without holding ministerial positions. Sun said that the cabinet formation has been in constant consultation with the President and other senior Kuomintang leaders for days, and it was successful after six days of hard work. He continued that he had tried his best to accommodate the opinions of various factions within the party, but it was regrettable that several famous figures had refused his invitation to join the cabinet. On this point, he particularly pointed out that he originally intended to invite Dr. Hu Shih to be the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Dr. Hu was the former Chinese Ambassador to the United States and is now the President of National Peking University. It is rumored that he has been internally decided to be President Chiang's highest adviser.

Since the breakdown of the KMT-CPC "peace talks" in January of the 36th year of the Republic by the Executive Yuan, this is the first time that the Premier of the Executive Yuan has publicly stated that he is prepared to negotiate "honorable peace" with the Communists.

However, Sun also explained at the press conference that the new cabinet is not surrendering to the Communists immediately, but only willing to consider what he called "honorable peace."

However, Sun's statement clearly conflicts with the policies that Nanjing has always shown, because President Chiang urged the people to continue fighting under his leadership as late as early November of this year when the Northeast fell, just like the War of Resistance Against Japan.

Sun has obtained the cooperation of Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, Chen Lifu, etc., and his so-called "cabinet of heavyweights" has been formed.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 20th] Sun Ke formed a new cabinet on Monday evening and declared that he "will continue the war until an honorable peace is achieved." Sun did not deny the possibility of compromise and peace with the Communists. Sun said that the list of cabinet members will be submitted to President Chiang on Monday night and may be announced on Tuesday.

Sun said at a press conference: "I guarantee that we will never surrender to the Communists immediately." Sun said that this kind of surrender would make China "a second Poland or Czechoslovakia." A reporter asked: Will the new cabinet compromise with the Communists? Sun said: "Compromise requires cooperation from both sides. The new cabinet is not a surrender cabinet." According to Sun's secretary, Sun once told President Chiang that he could not organize a "strong cabinet."

### Beiping Pingmin Daily Warns Communists Not to Destroy Cultural Relics

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 20th] The Pingmin Daily here published an editorial today, warning the Communist Party not to allow the ancient relics and cultural relics of the old capital to be destroyed by artillery fire. The article, entitled "Protect the Ancient Relics and Cultural Relics of the Old Capital," first stated: "The ancient relics and cultural relics of the old capital are the only things left to us by our ancestors that are worthy of pride. No matter what the reason, they must be preserved and cared for, and must not be destroyed by artillery fire." It continued: Commander-in-Chief Fu and the National Army under his command are stationed here by order of the Central Government and entrusted by the people. He has only heartache. The outer strongholds concentrate their forces in Beiping to achieve the task of protecting ancient relics and cultural relics. There is absolutely no reason to leave again to protect the old capital. In view of the fact that the National Army has not taken advantage of the convenience of a solid perimeter defense for consecutive days, and has spared no effort to maneuver more than ten miles away, it is enough to see his painstaking efforts to protect cultural relics and monuments. Only the Communist Party is the only one who can destroy the old capital. The article further pointed out: Beiping is by no means a must-contend place. Although Beiping has its political influence, it is not of great significance in terms of military value. If the political influence is reduced for the sake of winning a political stronghold, it is not only unwise, but also outweighs the gains. The article specifically stated that it is standing on the purely people's stand to express a little of the people's opinions to the Chinese people, and the motive for writing this article is not to make any comments on the current war, but to hope that the ancient relics inherited for thousands of years will not be destroyed by artillery fire.

### Candidates for New President of the Legislative Yuan Under Consideration by Authorities

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, and Chen Lifu, Vice-President of the Legislative Yuan, have both joined the Executive Yuan, and their positions in the Legislative Yuan should immediately submit their resignations in accordance with the law, so that the Legislative Yuan can elect a new president. It is known that the resignations of the two Suns and Chen have not been sent out as of midnight on the 20th. The candidates for the new president of the Legislative Yuan were previously rumored to be Wu Tiecheng, but now that Wu has also joined the cabinet, this statement has also become a thing of the past. It is rumored that Yan Huiqing may be elected. Yan is now in Shanghai. It is said that he has said that he is old and may not have the energy to take on the important task of President of the Yuan. The selection of this candidate is being considered by the highest authorities. If it is submitted quickly, it is expected that an additional meeting of the Central Standing Committee will be convened for discussion on the 21st. The second general assembly of the Legislative Yuan is about to end. After the regular meeting on the 21st, there will be three more sessions before the recess at the end of the month. Therefore, the election of the new president will inevitably proceed quickly, so that the national general budget for the next year can be reviewed and completed as scheduled before the end of the session.

### Huai River Entire Line Becomes Quiet; Canal Line Recovers Jieshou

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 20th] After the battle of Shuangduiji, Liu Bocheng's and Chen Geng's bandit troops and Huang Wei's corps were exhausted and crippled, and they are now fleeing to the northwest Yellow Flood area to lie dormant and take a short breather. Now the entire Huai River line is very quiet, and only Wuhe and Xuyi on the right wing have been infiltrated by bandits for two weeks, causing the area to be slightly unstable. It is reported that there are about ten incomplete bandit regiments hiding on both sides of the Huai River in this area. However, due to the strict air force blockade of the Huai River with patrolling flights, it is very difficult for them to smuggle and resupply in large numbers. The military has dispatched teams to search for and suppress the small groups of Communist bandits that have infiltrated the Huai River.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 20th] Chen Yi's bandit troops, who were facing off against my Wang Yuming's troops between Yongcheng and Suxian, have been counterattacked by our army for several days.

### Editorial: The Resurgence of War in Indonesia

The long-standing Dutch-Indonesian conflict has worsened again due to the Dutch government's insistence on accepting conditions before resuming negotiations, ultimately leading to a breakdown. On the 18th, Dutch forces launched the most intense attack on Yogyakarta, the capital of the Indonesian Republic, with their most elite British and American-equipped troops. According to a war report issued by the Dutch military headquarters: "Dutch troops have crossed the defense lines in Java and Sumatra, and under the cover of naval and air forces, launched an assault on Indonesia. The results are as follows: (1) Dutch paratroopers have occupied the airfield near Yogyakarta; (2) Dutch ground forces are advancing on the capital 60 miles west of Yogyakarta; (3) Dutch marines have landed in east-central Java; (4) Other troops have entered the Sumatra area." At the same time, the Dutch government explained this military action, stating: "The military action in Indonesia is not a combat action aimed at the Indonesian Republican government and the Indonesian people who are willing to cooperate with the Netherlands, but a police action against terrorists who make constructive work impossible."

No matter how grandly the Dutch authorities explain their reasons, from the perspective of us Asian people, the resurgence of war in Indonesia is ultimately a misfortune for Asia. In diplomatic negotiations, the Netherlands maintained such an "overbearing" attitude, constantly threatening Indonesia with force. Finally, taking advantage of its military superiority, it did not hesitate to violate the sacred truce agreement and launch an offensive against Indonesia first. This not only exposed the imperialist face of the Netherlands towards Indonesia but also made it clear to the world who was striving for peace and who was creating war in the Dutch-Indonesian dispute. Therefore, we cannot help but express our deep regret for the Dutch authorities' blind belief in force and reckless initiation of war, which caused the flames of war in Indonesia to reignite.

During World War II, Indonesia was also under Japanese occupation. Although subject to strict control by the Japanese army, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the general population did not diminish due to high pressure. In August 1945, when Japan announced its unconditional surrender, the Indonesian people believed that the opportunity for "freedom and independence" had arrived, and their desire for national self-determination reached its peak. Therefore, during the transitional period, disturbances inevitably occurred in various places. Unexpectedly, the British authorities, seeing the weakness of the Dutch garrison, entered the Batavia area in September to maintain local order, which aroused the resentment of the Indonesian people. New and old hatreds erupted at the same time, and the so-called Indonesian movement became uncontrollable, with clashes occurring everywhere with British and Dutch troops. Initially, the Dutch authorities were quite aware of the bigger picture, believing that the Indonesian movement was a world trend and irresistible. On February 10, 1946, they issued an enlightened declaration, allowing the Indonesian people to freely choose their future political system. However, this empty declaration failed to immediately bring peace to Indonesia. There were talks and fights, and fights and talks until a truce agreement was reached in October 1946. Negotiations continued, and another agreement was reached in March 1947, stipulating the establishment of the Federal Republic of Indonesia on January 1, 1949, which, although possessing sovereignty, would still be under the Dutch crown. Therefore, strictly speaking, the Indonesian issue has not yet been thoroughly resolved. Before long, this truce agreement became a scrap of paper. The resumption of war in Indonesia has made the situation in Southeast Asia even more serious. In order to stabilize Asia, the United States mediated, and in January 1948, the Dutch and Indonesian parties reached another agreement,勉使雙方相安於一時. Unexpectedly, within less than a year, the flames of war in Indonesia rekindled, which is an unfortunate event, whether for the benefit of both the Dutch and Indonesian parties or for the peace of Asia.

Now, the cannons of Yogyakarta are resounding in the sky, and the Indonesian people are fighting for freedom and independence and will never yield halfway. The Netherlands, taking advantage of its military superiority, will not give up halfway either. Therefore, the prospect for Indonesia is very bleak. The people of all Asian countries cannot stand idly by and cannot tolerate the Netherlands' approach to Indonesia. In particular, we Chinese, with millions of overseas Chinese who will be affected by the devastation of the war, must oppose the Netherlands' warlike policy. Our representative in the Security Council has strived to advocate that the Dutch and Indonesians should immediately resume negotiations, but it has not been successful due to the stubborn attitude of the Netherlands, which is inevitably disappointing. Now that the war in Indonesia has reignited, the people of all Asian countries can only take united action to protest the Netherlands' actions in Indonesia and demand that the Netherlands immediately and unconditionally cease hostilities, so that the Dutch authorities understand that in today's age of the people, no place in Asia can be a colony of another country again. In addition, we must also ask the Security Council to take swift action to extinguish the resurgence of war in Indonesia.

### Wei Daoming Reports at the Taiwan Provincial Assembly Meeting on Taiwan Currency and Food Policy; 110 Billion Taiwan Dollars Currently in Circulation

[Our Newspaper Taipei 20th Dispatch] The Provincial Assembly held a general meeting today for the entire day for general reports and inquiries on administration. Chairman Wei and the directors of various departments and bureaus were present. In his general report, Wei elaborated in detail on the Taiwan currency and food policy, intending to explain the misunderstandings that the Taiwan currency is gradually inflating and that the food policy is harming farmers due to low grain prices. Subsequently, various assembly members raised questions, which were explained separately. Key points are as follows: (1) Taiwan's redemption of gold banknotes has been approved by the central government to serve as reserves for the Taiwan currency. (2) The current amount of Taiwan currency in circulation is 110 billion, which may increase to 160 billion in the future due to production needs. (3) The provincial government is considering reasonably revising the purchase price of surplus grain from large households. (4) The food supply is balanced. The cultivated area this year has exceeded the record. The past food shortages were caused by smuggling. (5) Regarding land leasing, the government can consider giving landowners priority. (6) Inter-provincial trade is based on barter trade in principle. Some inquiries focused on how to seek stability and prosperity for Taiwan, but there were no concrete solutions. Regarding public enterprises, there were still criticisms. Wei also admitted that management may be unsatisfactory in some areas. The assembly then made a temporary motion to form a public enterprise investigation committee to thoroughly investigate.

### Question of Compatriots from Other Provinces Moving to Taiwan; Wei Daoming Answers Questions from Assembly Members; Sufficient Food Supply; Apologizes for Housing Shortage

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 20th] Wei Daoming stated at the Taiwan Provincial Assembly this morning: "At present, we must strengthen provincial defenses on the one hand and prevent the infiltration of traitors into Taiwan on the other hand. Regarding the former, the central government has made full arrangements on both the naval and air force sides in the province, so there is no need to worry. What should be carefully guarded against now is the infiltration of traitors and the spreading of rumors to confuse the public. As long as the people and the government cooperate closely, the security of Taiwan is absolutely guaranteed." During today's meeting, two assembly members believed that an increasing number of compatriots from other provinces are being evacuated to Taiwan, which the Taiwanese people warmly welcome, but because Taiwan's population is too large, this matter should be considered. They also expressed concern about how to use the large sums of money brought in for legitimate purposes, how to maintain Taiwan's tradition of thrift, and how to solve Taiwan's housing and food problems. Wei Daoming replied: "Most of the refugees in the mainland are moving to the southwestern provinces, and only a small number are coming to Taiwan. Among them are naval and air force personnel, or people who have long planned to come to Taiwan to start businesses. This is urgently needed to strengthen Taiwan's defenses and develop productive enterprises. As for those who have no businesses and come to Taiwan to live, they account for only a very small number. There is absolutely enough food to supply in Taiwan. What I am concerned about is the lack of housing, which is the current serious problem. Due to insufficient facilities in Taiwan, there is a housing shortage. I am very sorry to the people from other provinces who have come to Taiwan." Wei also stated: "At this time of tense world affairs, we may encounter typhoons and heavy rains at any time. We must help each other in the same boat. We must know that happiness and hardship are shared and inseparable. Only by jointly maintaining safety can we overcome difficult and dangerous situations."

### Passenger Limit Exceeded on Ship from Shanghai to Taiwan; Zhongxing Wheel to Be Fined Heavily

[Central News Agency, Keelung, 20th] The Keelung Port Authority recently fined the Zhongxing Wheel NT$90 million for exceeding the passenger limit by 500 to 600 people on two occasions when it sailed from Shanghai to Keelung on the 8th and 17th of this month.

The ship does have an excess of passengers, but it has been approved by the Shanghai Maritime Administration to increase the original limit to 1,600 people. The ship's life-saving equipment has been increased and can meet the needs of 2,000 people, so there is no danger in sailing at sea. The ship has carried as many as 2,200 to 2,500 passengers on its two recent voyages from Shanghai to Taiwan. Although the Shanghai Maritime Administration has approved its increase in the limit, it is still suspected of exceeding the limit.

### English News Items

Steel Industry Nationalization Bill

The steel industry nationalization bill finally passed its second reading in the British House of Commons after three days of debate. In the cabinet system of Great Britain, when a political party holds a majority of seats in the House of Commons, all debates on bills are merely a form of political education for the people, and in substance, it is not necessarily able to influence whether the bill is passed or not. This steel industry nationalization bill looks set to pass its third reading and complete its statutory procedure in the House of Commons. According to the current system, it must then be sent to the House of Lords, where it is likely to be rejected. Therefore, if the government is determined to implement this policy, it must pass through the continued approval of the House of Commons in three sessions over two years before it can become law. However, the new "Parliament Act" proposed last November seeks to change two years to one year and three sessions to two, but this new Parliament Act itself was rejected by the House of Lords and must be based on the old method. If the new Parliament Act becomes law in the winter of 1949 according to the old law, then this steel industry nationalization bill could also become law before the 1950 general election.

The nationalization of important enterprises is the Labor Party's basic policy for implementing socialism. Since the Labor Party came to power in 1945, the first to be nationalized was the Bank of England, followed by coal mines, gas, electricity, transportation, and other items. The steel industry has probably encountered the greatest resistance to nationalization. Opponents of nationalization can raise many reasons, such as the efficiency of nationalized industries may not be higher than that of private ones, the steel industry is already under government supervision, and it is not appropriate to have such legislation in the country given the current international tensions... etc. However, as far as we can see, most of the arguments against are peripheral. If the Labor Party is determined to implement socialism, then it naturally cannot fail to fulfill its previous promise of nationalizing the steel industry, which can almost be said to be the foundation of all industries. However, its true implementation may still depend on whether the Labor Party wins the 1950 general election.

Southern Ireland and Britain

The Southern Irish government has finally submitted a bill to its parliament to repeal the "External Relations Act." The repeal of this External Relations Act is, in fact, the repeal of the relationship between the British monarch and Southern Ireland, and makes Southern Ireland no longer a member of the "British Commonwealth." In fact, Southern Ireland has long been an independent country, and they even maintained their neutral status in the last World War. Therefore, in theory, it only deprives Southern Ireland of a nominal king. In reality, there are still some effects. First, the people of Southern Ireland will henceforth (after the abolition of the External Relations Act) become foreigners in the United Kingdom. Regardless of occupation, etc., they will henceforth be treated the same as ordinary foreigners and will not be able to enjoy the freedom and convenience enjoyed by the people of the United Kingdom. This is somewhat of an impact because there are many Southern Irish people in the United Kingdom. Second, Southern Ireland can no longer enjoy "Imperial Preference" in business dealings. However, according to the rulers of Southern Ireland, they believe that these can all be agreed upon by treaty. However, in any case, this must also be among the important considerations of the Southern Irish government. Therefore, not long ago, although Southern Ireland did not participate in the Prime Ministers' Conference of White Dominions, it still had contact with the prime ministers. Recently, it also sent representatives to Paris to consult with the personnel of various Dominions attending the United Nations. According to Southern Ireland's view, the repeal of this External Relations Act will not weaken its relationship with the United Kingdom and the various Dominions, but will strengthen it; they just do not want this name.

Following this issue, one possibility is that one or two other Dominions also intend to no longer have a nominal "king." The second is that after Southern Ireland abolishes the External Relations Act, it may feel the need to merge Northern and Southern Ireland (Northern Ireland is currently part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain). It will probably take some thought on how to solve these problems. But in the current international situation, it is not credible to say that this is the disintegration of the "British Commonwealth."

### The CCP as Seen by the British

Is an Orthodox Marxist

[Central News Agency, London, 19th] British people hold extremely divergent opinions on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). British conservatives firmly believe that the CCP is an orthodox Marxist. They believe that if our country were to embrace communism, it would only add another vassal state to the Soviet Union. Conservative MP McLean wrote in today's Daily Telegraph: "If China is allowed to embrace communism, it will become like Outer Mongolia or Romania and Poland, and fall under the rule of the Soviet Union." The diplomatic correspondent of The Times wrote in the newspaper today that he reached the same conclusion based on Mao Zedong's recent article published in the journal of the Communist Information Bureau. He said: The CCP is by no means a disguised Marxist.

### Tung Oil in Guangxi

— Our Newspaper Reporter, Yushan

In the midst of promoting production and striving to increase foreign exchange earnings, tung oil, as one of China's special products, should be valued! The use of tung oil is not only as an ordinary paint, but in today's advanced chemical industry, tung oil has become an important raw material for all military industries. The manufacture of airplanes, warships, and guns all requires tung oil. Tung oil can also be used in medicine, preservatives, insecticides, and to make electrical insulation paints. In addition, it can also be refined into gasoline substitutes.

Among tung oil production in China, Sichuan has the most, followed by Guangxi, and Guangxi can be said to be a rising star. Guangxi planted tung trees on a large scale. As early as 1931, the provincial authorities vigorously promoted the planting of tung trees in order to develop special products and increase exports. By 1935, it was roughly estimated that the area planted with tung trees in the province had reached 1.23 million mu, producing 230,000 dan of tung oil, second only to grain and accounting for 16.36% of total exports. This was the first sign of increased tung oil production in Guangxi. By 1937, the area planted with tung trees had reached more than 2.56 million mu, producing more than 289,000 dan of tung oil, accounting for one-quarter of total exports and taking the top spot. Although it has declined since then due to the impact of the war, it has always remained a major source of wealth.

Although tung trees grow relatively widely, they also require a certain environment. They are not cold-resistant and can grow if the winter temperature is above zero degrees. They need a lot of rain during growth and little rain during maturity. If there is too much rain, the oil content will not be high. Areas with a lot of rain and strong sunshine in June, July, August, and September are most suitable for growth. There is a saying, "Small fruit in June with drought, little oil in July with drought," which means this. The soil is suitable except for extremely high mountains, with loam and sandy loam being the most suitable. Acidic and humus-rich soil is even better, while sticky soil and soil with too much lime and alkalinity are prone to discoloration. Guangxi spans the temperate and tropical zones, has a mild climate, and has a lot of rain. The calcium-rich soil containing lime is often leached into residual soil by rain, making it most suitable for growth. More than 70 of the province's 100 counties and cities produce tung oil, which shows how widespread its distribution is. The tung oil production centers are in the central and northeastern parts of the province, including Guanyang, Longsheng, Fuchuan, Zhaoping, Rong County, Tianyang, Du'an, Yishan, Quan County, He County, Liujiang, Sanjiang, Luorong, Longshan, Shanglin, and other places. The province's average planting area is 253,723 mu, the average annual output is 328,817 dan, and the export volume is 211,880 dan, accounting for more than 70%.

The quality of tung oil produced in the central region is the best, followed by the Yujiang River basin. Tung oil production has always used traditional pressing methods, so it is not very pure. In the past, the province established a office at the Wuzhou Tung Oil Export Office to inspect tung oil for export. The tung oil produced in this province is mostly yellowish-brown in color, with a specific gravity (at 15.5 degrees Celsius) of up to 0.9430, an acid value of entering, a saponification value of 195, and a refractive index (at 25 degrees Celsius) of 1.5000. According to the Hua Situo test, it solidifies in seven and a half minutes and is not sticky when cut.

Currently, the increase in tung oil production and the improvement of quality require urgent efforts and improvements. The province's plan is to increase the planting of tung trees by 1 million mu and 600,000 trees every year starting in 1947, with the expectation of increasing production by 300,000 dan annually starting in 1950. The government will send personnel to supervise and manage the cultivation of improved varieties, technical improvement, and pest and disease control. The oil extraction method is also planned to be changed to use new machinery, and it is planned to use its own raw materials to build factories on a large scale to manufacture paints in order to supply domestic consumption and promote exports at the same time, in order to create a new outlet for the province's tung oil industry.

The provincial government has selected 34 counties and cities this year that are equipped with cooperative loans, grain loans, and relief plowing cattle to promote tung tree planting and afforestation, including Pingle, Fuchuan, Xing'an, Yishan, Wuxuan, Pingnan, Xiang County, Qianjiang, Zhongshan, Gongcheng, Cangwu, Lingchuan, Rong County, Liujiang, Lingui, Jiabin, Liujiang, Luorong, Baishou, Guilin, Hechi, Lipu, Wuming, Yongfu, Xiuren, Liucheng, Quan County, Shanglin, Yining, Suilu, Ziyuan, Mengshan, Guanyang, and Guixian. The first 24 counties have been completed, with a total afforestation area of 45,600 mu and a total of 1,596,626 trees planted, including 594,993 tung trees. This number is naturally still very small compared to the province's wasteland. The province's wasteland area is 20,750, and the area is less than one-tenth. This cannot be self-satisfying.

At present, the central government attaches great importance to a major export commodity that has historically occupied the main export position. In order to stimulate production, promote exports, and earn foreign exchange, it has clearly ordered that the purchase prices in various places be allowed to refer to international prices, deducting various expenses and legal export profits as the standard, and adjusting them appropriately to ensure supply and facilitate exports. Pay attention to avoiding exploitation by middlemen, and the prices quoted should be directly beneficial to tung farmers. At the same time, the government provides merchants with transportation conveniences to prosper special products and develop foreign trade. This measure is obviously very necessary.

### US Government Is Very Interested in the Proposal to Arm Japan to Defend Against Communism; It Is Expected to Be Opposed by the USSR in the Far East Commission

[United Press, Washington, 20th] Senior government officials on the 20th expressed keen interest in the proposal to establish a 150,000-man armed security force in Japan to curb communist plots. According to this proposal, advocated by Acheson, former right-hand man of MacArthur in Japan, MacArthur himself also agreed to strengthen Japan's national defense and enhance the status of the democratic government. Some government officials, looking forward to the time when the occupying forces withdraw from Japan, believe that it would be a mistake to have only 18,000 police officers currently equipped with pistols in all of Japan once the US occupying forces withdraw. The Japanese constitution, drafted under Allied supervision, prohibits the creation of any military force and guarantees that Japan will strive for international peace. A security force would not be enough to make Japan a threat to world peace, but on the other hand, it would be a powerful weapon to maintain peace and security. It is pointed out that this army could have rifles, mortars, machine guns and other light weapons, but would not be allowed to equip artillery and a navy, as launching a war requires the cover of the latter two. Diplomats believe that with a total population of 80 million in Japan, Acheson only advocates a security force of 150,000, and the number should not be increased. The United States has not yet decided whether to propose the establishment of a Japanese security force, but if this plan is submitted to the Far East Commission, the decision-making body for occupation, it will be strongly opposed by the Soviet Union. Authorities here said that even without the communist threat, the Japanese government must have a strong security force to guard against extreme right-wing elements, who had controlled Japan's fate before the war.

### Yoshida Cabinet in Difficult Situation Due to Allied Headquarters' New Economic Principles Conflicting with the Policies of the Liberal Party

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] The Democratic Liberal Party of Shigeru Yoshida is greatly shaken today due to the temporary directive issued by the Allied Headquarters to stabilize the Japanese economy. The Allied Headquarters' directive severely criticized the party's free-market economic measures, and Yoshida's cabinet has now fallen into a difficult situation. Observers say that the extremely conservative Democratic Liberal Party will be forced to change its economic policies, or it will not be able to remain in power, as the opposition parties are all using the Allied Headquarters' nine-point economic principles to achieve their political goals. Today, the opposition parties loudly demanded Yoshida's resignation in parliament in order to implement the Allied Headquarters' economic instructions. The industrial sector is pleased with the Allied Headquarters' nine-point economic principles, believing that this is an indication that the United States will provide Japan with a large amount of aid in the coming years. The announcement of the nine-point economic principles clearly demonstrates the United States' determination to fully assist Japan in achieving economic self-sufficiency. The industrial sector expects that continued large-scale U.S. aid to Japan will accelerate Japan's industrial production.

### British and American Tanks and Aircraft Actually Used to Attack Indonesia

Philippine Newspaper Believes Britain and America Cannot Help but Feel Ashamed

[Associated Press, Manila, 20th] The people of the Philippines today deeply regret the recent "police action" of the Dutch government to overthrow the Indonesian Republic and capture Yogyakarta, believing that it is unwise to indirectly assist the Communist Party's propaganda plans in Southeast Asia. The U.S. government's failure to recognize the right of colonial peoples to freely choose their government is also a violation of the spirit of the Atlantic Charter and cannot be blameless. According to an editorial in the Manila Times today, the resumption of war in Indonesia is the most tragic example of the failure of the United Nations' work. British and American tanks and aircraft are the main weapons in this attack. If the British and American governments want to see the object of the attack as a nation determined and capable of crushing the Communist threat, they cannot help but feel ashamed. The initial result of this action is the victory of British and American tanks and aircraft. These weapons were originally made to defend freedom, but they were unexpectedly used for attack. The bombs dropped by aircraft in Java and Sumatra are nothing more than seeds of hatred, and the hatred of 70 million people and their friends has a far-reaching impact and cannot be taken lightly.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 19th] Brockway, a veteran socialist who currently serves as the chairman of the British "Anti-Imperialist League," today sent a telegram to the Security Council, requesting it to immediately find a way to stop the Dutch military actions in Indonesia and to release Dr. Sukarno and other ministers of the Republic.

### Soviet Union Plots to Deplete U.S. Resources; Washington Cautiously Guards Against It; U.S. Export Controls Find Loopholes

[United Press, Washington, 19th] U.S. officials stated on the 19th that U.S. policy planners are carefully guarding against any attempt by the Soviet Union to weaken the United States by excessively depleting its resources. The authorities firmly believe that Moscow may exert pressure to cause a significant loss of U.S. funds and other resources in Cash, thereby weakening the United States economically. They say that the main point of the Soviet Union's plan is that communism will exhaust U.S. resources. The Soviet Union's unwillingness to reach agreements within the United Nations, its insistence on the Berlin blockade, and its efforts to promote international communism in order to incite chaos and harassment around the world are all considered to be in support of this principle.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] The U.S. Senate's top investigation committee recently criticized serious shortcomings in U.S. export controls, demanding strict enforcement to ensure that goods shipped abroad do not flow into the Iron Curtain. The committee, led by Senator Ferguson, issued a report stating that current controls on export programs are now better, but many improvements are still needed. The report, "based on a long-term investigation into the so-called black market for export fake passports, proves that rare materials can eventually reach the Soviet Union and its satellite countries."

Outside the quiet nunnery gate, hundreds of cars suddenly stopped today, and the curious are rushing to see the heavenly flowers. There are also speculations that the petals were scattered from the window on the top of the nunnery. However, Catholics piously prostrate themselves, because the miracle of raining flowers has also been seen in Lisieux, France.

Outside the gate of the White-Robed Nunnery today, there are small vendors selling heavenly flowers, and passersby are rushing to buy them without suspecting their authenticity. A Philippine official is willing to pay US$50 to buy them. Rumor has it that heavenly flowers can cure strange diseases.

Detailed Rules for Exchange Methods Resolved

After detailed consultation, the meeting decided on the following detailed rules for the exchange of gold and silver for public educators: (1) The exchange of gold and silver dollars for public educators shall be handled by the Shanghai City Bank entrusted by the Central Bank. (2) Public educators (including employees such as job technicians and laborers) who exchange gold are limited to those who have been approved by the Shanghai Public Education Personnel Materials Supply Committee (hereinafter referred to as "this committee") to distribute physical objects in December 1948. Each person will be issued an application to exchange gold, permitting the exchange of one tael of gold or 49 silver dollars. (3) Applications for gold exchange permits will be sent by the City Bank to the committee for distribution to the general leaders of each physical object distribution unit, who will then forward them to each employee. (The procedure for each unit to receive the permits is the same as the procedure for receiving the physical object purchase certificate). At the same time, the committee will issue a "List of the Number of People Exchanging Gold," one for each agency. (4) Each employee should fill in the items specified on the permit in detail, and submit it along with their ID card and the price to the original work unit without having to queue up. (5) After collecting the permits and ID cards, each agency should carefully check the ID cards submitted by each employee to ensure that they have not exchanged gold before, and then stamp the permit with the seal of the agency and the name stamp of the person in charge. Prepare an official letter and submit it to the City Bank in total, and fill in the "List of the Number of People Exchanging Gold" (the numbers must be written in school handwriting), and submit it to the committee for review. After verifying that the number of people does not exceed the number of people receiving physical objects, the committee will add a verification stamp and forward the original to the City Bank for verification. (6) After receiving the permits, ID cards, and list of the number of people exchanging gold, the City Bank will process them in the order of the lot numbers drawn by each agency. The bank will notify each agency separately of the date for payment and gold exchange, which must be handled within the notified time limit. Those who fail to do so will be postponed and handled later. (7) Personnel who have already exchanged gold at the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank will not be allowed to exchange gold within the prescribed period, as their ID cards have been stamped with an exchange stamp or punched. (8) If there are errors in the procedures for the exchange of gold by each unit, or if they do not comply with the regulations, for example, if a unit has a hundred people exchanging gold, but ten of them have permits but no ID cards, or the ID cards have already been stamped with an exchange stamp or punched, or the name on the permit does not match the name on the ID card, or the price is incomplete, etc., all of them will be temporarily retained. First, handle the ninety people. After all the units that drew lots have finished, then handle the supplement. If there are many units with similar situations, they will also be handled in the order of the original lot numbers when supplementing. Therefore, each unit should handle these procedures with special care to avoid confusion and to be quick. (9) All payments to the City Bank by each agency must be in cash. (10) Each unit should send one staff member to assist the City Bank in handling the various procedures on the day scheduled for the unit to exchange gold. (11) The fineness or weight of each tael of gold exchanged may be insufficient or exceeded. The City Bank may calculate the receipt or refund based on the actual amount, but each deposit slip will still be based on 1,000 yuan, without refund or supplement.

### Second Batch of Application Forms Scheduled to Be Issued on the 23rd

### Cigarette Industry Petition; Satisfactory Result; Three Goals Proposed; Ministry of Finance Agrees to Consider

The Shanghai cigarette factories have been affected by the change in the method of collecting cigarette tax rates, the weakness of market purchasing power, the severing of sales channels in North China, and the excessively low tax rates in South China, which have affected production and sales and made it impossible to maintain production, causing serious situations of factory shutdowns and worker unemployment in this city. Zhou Xuexiang, of the Cigarette Workers Welfare Committee, in view of the long-term shutdowns that endanger workers' lives and social order, accompanied eleven worker representatives, including Cheng Shunxing, Yao Ligen, and Zhu Desheng, to petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Central Agricultural and Industrial Department in Beijing, focusing on the crux of the problem. The heads of the various ministries personally received them. In addition to stating the workers' suffering and the increasing number of factory shutdowns and worker unemployment, especially female workers, who account for more than 70% of all cigarette industry workers and have not received a penny of wages for three or four weeks, the representatives proposed the following petition goals: (1) Restore the old formula of 75% taxation for cigarette taxes to facilitate factory production and enable workers to have work to do. (2) Cigarette taxes in South China should be levied at the same price and amount as in Shanghai to facilitate external sales and maintain full wage income for pieceworkers. (3) Please ask the government to provide general industrial loans to cigarette factories so that they can quickly resume production and workers can resume work as soon as possible. As a result, they were all sympathetic to the crisis in the Shanghai cigarette industry and the suffering of unemployed workers, and agreed to immediately conduct a thorough investigation and remedy the situation. The Ministry of Finance, in particular, in view of the abnormal state of cigarette factory production, where cigarette taxes are intended to increase but instead decrease within half a month, decided to issue a clear written reply to Shanghai within three days. Zhou told reporters at the end that Shanghai is the economic capital of the country, and its stability and prosperity are of great importance. Therefore, although the petition is ostensibly to maintain factory production, it is actually closely related to the interests of workers. Therefore, the purpose of the petition is satisfactory and far-reaching, and this is expected. However, during this period, it is hoped that all workers can consider the difficulties of the times. With the spirit of sharing weal and woe and solidarity, we will tide over the difficulties, wait patiently for the resumption of work, and never act rashly and overstep the bounds, so that the legitimate motives of the workers will be subject to legal interference, resulting in consequences that are both undesirable and unattainable.

### Record of Survival from the Jiangya Steamer Disaster

— Zhong Xueli

On December 3rd, I received orders from the hospital (Note: The author was an internal medicine physician at the First Red Cross Hospital) to return temporarily to the Yangming Hospital in Yuyao for internal medicine work. I boarded the Jiangya Steamer at 3:30 PM and it departed at 4:00 PM. I had dinner in the dining hall at 5:30 PM, and returned to my cabin around 6:00 PM to chat with fellow cabinmates, Mr. Gu and Mr. Qin. I was content and unaware of the impending disaster. In the midst of our conversation, a deafening sound suddenly erupted, shaking the entire ship. Then, the lights went out. The sounds of metal breaking and clashing, objects falling and scattering, cries for help from the lower cabins, and the terrified wails of children filled the air. Realizing something was wrong, I, along with Mr. Qin and Mr. Gu, forced our way out of the cabin in the darkness. We searched for a ladder among the crowd and, with the help of two crew members in white, climbed onto the deck. By this time, the chaos was even worse. The radio had been destroyed, and the steam whistle, intended to send a distress signal, only managed a single, incomplete blast before falling silent.

People on the ship shouted: "The boiler has exploded!"

Then, we heard people on the ship shout: "The boiler has exploded! Remain calm and await rescue!" This only heightened the panic. The glass windows and planks were shattered by the struggling crowds, and people mistakenly fell into the ocean in the darkness. The Jiangya had already begun to sink, and many third- and fourth-class passengers perished instantly. At the same time, countless people surged onto the deck, trampling each other in the process. I fell and struggled to my feet several times. Soon, people were fighting to board lifeboats and grab life preservers, desperately struggling for survival in the darkness. The scene was like something out of the underworld. At that moment, I maintained my composure, looked around, and waited for a ship. Whenever I saw a glimmer of light, we worked together to shout for help, sound whistles, or shine flashlights to try to attract attention. However, a couple of large steamers and several small sailboats that passed by ignored us completely and sailed away. The crowd erupted in angry curses, adding to the anguish.

The Jinyuanli Arrives, Rescuing Hundreds

Around 9:00 PM, we spotted a large motorized sailboat speeding towards us, identified as the Jinyuanli, acting as a volunteer rescuer on the orders of its owner. The crowd was overjoyed and rushed towards the area where the sailboat was approaching the Jiangya. In that instant, hundreds of people were saved. However, the chaos at that time was even greater than before. The strong pushed ahead, and many lost their footing. Countless elderly and weak were pushed into the sea. Finally, a large number of passengers hung suspended from the Jinyuanli's rescue ropes. The ropes broke under the weight, sending countless more into the sea. At this critical moment, I realized that the small boat was overcrowded and feared a secondary disaster. Believing that the first boat would surely radio for help from other vessels, I waited calmly for a lifeboat, hoping for another chance at survival.

After another hour, several more ships passed near the Jiangya, including another large steamer, which sailed away into the distance without showing any compassion or offering any assistance.

The Maohe Rescues Two or Three Hundred Passengers

Later, the Maohe, a ship heading to Zhoushan, heard our cries and came to our aid, hovering hesitantly for some time. At that time, there were only two or three hundred passengers left on the deck, and the rising seawater had already submerged most of it. A crew member shouted to the Maohe for help, informing them of the approximate number of survivors. The Maohe then used a powerful searchlight to scan the area several times before sending two small sampans to bring someone aboard to discuss the situation. After being informed of the facts, the Maohe agreed to use the sampans for rescue trips. They made dozens of round trips, first rescuing women and children, then men. I was finally rescued as well. About half an hour after boarding the Maohe, I looked back at the Jiangya, only to see the flagpole and the top of the smokestack still visible above the water. I couldn't help but shudder. The Maohe rescued approximately two or three hundred people. After the rescue, the Maohe, also overloaded, ran aground on a sandbar and had to drop anchor to await assistance from other vessels. Around 1:00 AM after midnight, the Haijin arrived and used small motorboats to ferry us, the distressed passengers, to safety. While on the Maohe, I looked around at the rescued crowd. Most were covered in mud and blood, their clothes torn. Some had lost loved ones, while others were the sole survivors of their families. A wave of grief washed over everyone, and they wept inconsolably. Their faces were blackened, and they looked at each other with pity. The Haijin took us back to Pier No. 7, then transferred us to a ferry to Pier No. 3. There, we saw thousands of family members and friends craning their necks in anticipation, many wailing in despair at the sight of those who had not survived. It was a truly horrific tragedy.

The Crew Lacked Public Spirit, Only Caring About Their Own Escape

In the aftermath of my survival, the horrific scene of the Jiangya disaster is still vivid in my mind. I would like to offer the following points to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the maritime industry, in the hope of preventing a recurrence of such a tragedy. (1) Overloading ships with passengers and cargo should be strictly avoided. (2) Seagoing vessels should have backup radio equipment in case of a power failure, so that they can still send distress signals even if the main system is damaged. (3) Seagoing crews should be trained in rescue techniques for themselves and passengers. In this Jiangya disaster, most passengers did not receive life preservers, leading to fierce competition. The ropes holding the lifeboats were not even released. Passengers cried out for help, but no one attended to them. Most of the crew only cared about saving themselves, demonstrating a complete lack of public spirit. (4) Baggage should be inspected before boarding to check for dangerous goods. (5) All parts of the engines should be thoroughly checked before departure to ensure that there are no problems.

### Zang Da'erzi Damage Compensation: Court Orders Payment of 10,000 Yuan

[Our Newspaper] In the case of Zang Da'erzi, the father of Zang Genbao, who was killed on September 23, 1946, after being instigated by the Spaniard Lai Lingnai to be assaulted by an American soldier, the plaintiff initially requested damages based on the cost of living at the time, totaling 145,100,400 Legal Tender. However, due to the depreciation of the currency and the currency reform, the above amount, when converted to gold yuan, was extremely small. Therefore, the plaintiff submitted a request to the court to use the rice price at the time of the judgment as the standard for converting to gold yuan, totaling 48,366.80 gold yuan. The court held a hearing the other day. The defendant's lawyer did not appear. The court found that the amount requested by the plaintiff was too large, and after considering the circumstances of both parties, ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff 10,000 gold yuan, and dismissed the remainder of the claim.

### Christmas Research

The end of the year is approaching, and the "joy to the world" Christmas is coming soon.

Christmas is undoubtedly the day of the birth of Jesus Christ; celebrating Christmas is to commemorate this savior of mankind. But was Jesus Christ born on December 25th? It has always been a mystery in history.

The currently circulating story of Jesus' birth is based on the accounts in the Bible. The Bible says that Jesus' mother, Mary, was an unmarried virgin who became pregnant through the Holy Spirit. Her fiancé, Joseph, learned of this and was deeply skeptical. While he was hesitating, he had a dream telling him the reason for his fiancée's pregnancy, confirming that it was through the Holy Spirit. It also said that this child was coming into the world to save people, to free them from all their sins, and that he was the savior of all the world. Joseph's doubts were thus dispelled, and he married Mary.

A few days before Jesus was born, an order came down to conduct a census, and all people had to return to their place of origin. Joseph and Mary also returned from Nazareth to Bethlehem to register. When they arrived in Bethlehem, they had not yet found an inn. Mary was about to give birth, so she gave birth to Jesus in a stable, and the manger became Jesus' cradle.

At the very moment of Jesus' birth, shepherds in the meadows outside Bethlehem saw a shining light in the sky, which greatly frightened them. At that moment, a host of heavenly soldiers, led by an angel, descended from the sky and said to the shepherds, "I am here to bring you good news. Today, in the city of David, the Savior Christ of all the world is born. You will find this baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger. Do not be afraid." After saying this, they ascended back into the sky. In the starry sky, the songs of praise to God could still be faintly heard.

The next morning, the shepherds went to Bethlehem according to the angel's words and found Jesus, and also met Joseph and Mary. The angel's words were confirmed. This good news quickly spread throughout the city; everyone knew that the Savior Christ had come. It was all spread from the mouths of the shepherds.

Although the Bible describes the story of Christ's birth, it does not specify the date; even the Book of Revelation, church history, or other books cannot find this answer. So, how did December 25th become Christmas? In the Bible dictionary, the Christmas entry says: "This festival began to be observed in the year 300 AD. The Western Church stipulated it on December 25th. The Eastern Church stipulated it on January 6th. However, this is the date stipulated by the Church and has no basis. And for hundreds of years, no one has observed this festival; it gradually progressed and then began to be observed."

In the Encyclopedia of Ethics and Religion, the explanation for Jesus' birth is: "...In the fourth century, the church decided to commemorate Jesus' birth, and later it became a common practice in the church. The Gospel of Fuchsia does not record in which month or day Jesus was born, but ancient people used December 25th as Christmas. It is not known on what basis they said this. Some say that the Jewish religion had a festival on this day, and the ancients used it as the day of Jesus' birth."

From the above two records, it is questionable whether Christmas is on December 25th. It is said that before the fifth century, there were several different versions of the date of Jesus' birth. One said it was January 6th, another said it was March 25th, and another said it was December 25th. Some people used the Hebrew calendar to calculate it, saying it should be April 20th. Others said it was May 20th, which was calculated using the Egyptian calendar.

The many possibilities of Jesus' birth date have left many Christians at a loss. However, for the past 1,560 years, December 25th has always been regarded as Jesus' birthday. It is said that December 25th was originally the Roman Saturnalia, and ancient Rome worshiped Saturn as the god of agriculture. In December, the agricultural work ended, which was the season of recreation. On December 25th each year, there was a grand celebration. In the fourth century, churches in various places became more and more developed day by day, and the number of believers also increased sharply. Many enthusiastic believers wanted to find a suitable way to commemorate this great savior Christ. However, there was no history to verify, and there were no traditional customs to follow, so they finally used the day of the Roman Saturnalia. In the twentieth century, everyone has forgotten the Saturnalia, but the grand and joyful Christmas will not be forgotten.

After December 25th was designated as Christmas, a dispute also occurred in England. England was a country where Christianity was developed. At that time, Puritans and heathens were divided into two factions. The discrimination was very severe. The Puritans said: December 25th Christmas was designated by heathens, not only could it not be echoed, but it was also considered a sin to insult God. Therefore, the Puritans set a penalty: anyone who echoed the heathen Christmas would be fined and paraded in public, or expelled from the country, or even executed. Every year, many people were punished because of this rule. When Cromwell dominated England, he went a step further and canceled all the festivals of the heathens; violators would be punished by the law.

Not only is the date of Jesus' birth impossible to verify, but there are also errors in the year of birth. Jesus' year of birth, according to Ex-Brother's calculation, is Roman Era 753, which is the Gregorian calendar era currently used. However, many scholars believe that Ex-Brother's calculation is four years wrong, and it should be four years before the Gregorian calendar era. But the Gregorian calendar has passed to this year, which is 1948, although it is four years different, it is not easy to correct.

Since the year of Jesus' birth is a problem, then the day of birth is of course even more impossible to determine.

### Chatting about Turkey

Turkey is a seasonal food for Christmas. The gray feathers, the ochre tassels, the shape is beautiful enough. The tall body and plump muscles also indicate that it has fat and delicious meat for people to enjoy. Therefore, on this once-a-year festival, you must prepare this most abundant and delicious dish.

It is said that the hometown of turkey is in the New World. When European immigrants first arrived in America, there was no warmth, but only severe cold and snow. As soon as the seeds were planted, they were covered with a thick layer of white snow. In this harsh northern winter, the crops were not harvested, and people died of starvation. Fortunately, there were many wild turkeys there for the immigrants who first came to the New World to fill their stomachs, which saved the lives of many people. From then on, every Christmas, eat turkey once to commemorate this difficult day for our ancestors.

The way to eat turkey is recorded in Western recipes. Recently, the US Department of Agriculture found a new species - the Beltsville White Turkey, and made it into a delicious dish for the enjoyment of people all over the world.

The Beltsville White Turkey is a kind of turkey with barely clear fine hairs on its body, and women often regard it as a gift. It matures a month earlier than ordinary turkeys. The body is large and small. Females weigh 8.5 to 9 pounds, and after plucking, they still weigh 7.5 to 8 pounds; that is to say, after plucking, they have not lost much weight. The meat is thick, fat and tender, and the chest is even more beautiful. A sumptuous Christmas banquet is indeed indispensable to this delicious dish.

The Department of Agriculture's food factory slaughters the Beltsville White Turkey, clears the feathers and internal organs, seals it in a molded pot, adds an appropriate amount of soup, and cooks it with steam. After the cooked chicken is loaded into cages, it is transported to Europe. It is the most beautiful food in canned household bags, and it is Uncle Sam's Christmas gift to Europeans.

One can is just one Beltsville White Turkey; after steaming, put it in a pot, add vegetables on the side, pour two spoons of thick soup, and it becomes a delicious dish. If you like more styles, you can divide the whole chicken into two halves, put half of it in a pot, which is still a main dish in the Christmas dinner, and cut the other half into small pieces, wrap it in thick wax paper, and roast it over the fire, which is a fragrant and beautiful roast chicken.

American families decorate Christmas trees with banknotes, which are used to aid Europe.

### Talking about Christmas Cards

The tradition of Christmas has been around for 1,500 years, but the use of Christmas cards is only 100 years old. However, in these 100 years, the drawing and printing of Christmas cards has progressed very quickly and has entered the realm of art. The scenery on the card includes snow-covered landscapes, and Santa Claus in white hair and red clothes. Many are the works of famous artists. Its decoration, gold-edged, gold-stamped, and also metal products, is really very exquisite. Today, although Christmas cards are a small gift for communication, they have actually become an interesting work of art.

Many painters have become famous from drawing Christmas cards, such as Kate Greeoaway, Harriett Bennett, Alice Havers, etc. Burlington Printing Company also relies on printing Christmas cards to make its business prosper. Many art groups in the United States make exquisite Christmas cards every year, which are art museums and photography museums with extremely rich artistic value. Handicraft manufacturers also make and sell many Christmas cards as their sideline. Although they are for profit, they do not lose their artistic meaning.

Hall, the solicitation director of the art exhibition, said: "The beautification of Christmas cards has opened up a vast new field for art. In the past, art works were cherished by people, and only a few people had the opportunity to appreciate them. Now, putting art works and Christmas cards together can be appreciated by thousands of people." Indeed, the beautification of Christmas cards has aroused the love of many people. Now, Christmas card collectors have appeared. They cherish all kinds of Christmas cards, which is a grand sight. Compared with the Christmas cards in the book, it is really a small trick.

### After the Revision of the Gold and Silver Storage and Exchange Policy, the Mint Processes and Casts One-Taël and Five-Qián Small Bars, All with a Fineness of Over Ninety-Five Percent

Rumors that the Central Mint had stopped casting gold bars are entirely untrue. According to the director of the mint, Wei Xianzhang, the rumors of stopping casting are purely speculation from the outside and are completely groundless. The government's gold and silver storage and exchange policy has been revised. Since the 13th of this month, the mint has stopped casting three types of large-denomination gold bars, including ten-taël, five-taël, and three-taël bars, and has been casting one-taël and five-qián small gold bars in their entirety. The mint is currently planning to increase production daily, and resumed night shifts the day before yesterday. The current daily casting quantity has reached over 10,000 bars. Regarding the fineness issue, because the raw materials currently used are those that were previously exchanged, the fineness is inevitably uneven. However, the mint is currently striving to improve it, and the fineness of the bars being cast is all over ninety-five percent.

### Flour Prices Rise as Suppliers Ask for Higher Prices; Grain Market Remains Strong, Oil Market Flat and Weak

Flour prices on the market rose yesterday due to the increase in rice prices on Saturday, which boosted confidence. Suppliers asked for higher prices. Old Brand flour opened at 140 yuan, an increase of 6 yuan compared to before the weekend. Military Ship flour rose slightly by 2 yuan, closing at 129 yuan. Red Peak flour rose by 8 yuan, and Jiancheng flour rose by 6 yuan. Miscellaneous Brand flour rose only slightly because its price was already relatively high. Bran rose by 4-5 yuan.

Grains

The market was booming and the mood confident. Soybeans rose by 5 yuan, Pinghu broad beans rose by 10 yuan. Sorted Green beans remained sluggish and the price weak. Corn demand was still high, rising by 10-15 yuan. Red sorghum suppliers raised prices, increasing them slightly by 5 yuan. Sesame only had local sales and few transactions. Prices remained firm. Raw peanuts rose by 20-30 yuan.

Edible Oil

The market was flat and weak. Soybean oil was supplied by factories, but sales were limited to local areas, and the price weakened by 10 yuan. Rong oil was not offered by factories, but exporters were buying it, boosting the market and rising by 10 yuan. Raw oil was stable. Barrel of raw oil was 930 yuan, and small cart sesame oil started at 800 yuan, closing at 840 yuan. Soybean cake oil was bought by merchants, rising by 5 yuan.

Sharp Reduction in Production and Exports

It is reported that for the November flour re-export quota, the Ministry of Food still intends to allocate it according to the previous allocation method to adjust the needs of various provinces and cities. Flour mills have already filled out their October production volume. However, due to raw material issues, flour production has decreased, so the number of quotas approved this time will also be reduced.

### This Period's Flour Procurement Reaches 200,000 Bags

The Food Grain Procurement Council Still Entrusts the Farmers Bank to Handle

The Food Grain Emergency Procurement and Storage Council, in order to regulate the flour needs of various regions and carry out flat-price distribution, has set a quota of 200,000 bags of flour to be purchased this period, and still entrusted the trust department of the Farmers Bank to make the purchase.

It is reported that the Farmers Bank has signed contracts with various flour mills. According to the production volume of each mill, the four district associations will separately assign purchase quotas, calculate them based on the current market price, and deliver a batch of flour every ten days from the date of the contract, to be delivered in three phases.

### Sugar Prices Show Mixed Trends

The sugar market yesterday was slightly weak, with sparse transactions. Local demand was not strong. Brokers were all reluctant to sell because banks were closing accounts for the end of the year, and payments could not be used on the same day. However, because the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's 36th quotation and allocation was about to be released, the market sentiment was slightly weak, and retail investors frequently sold off. Various grades fell compared to last Saturday.

No. 45 Bagged Granulated White Sugar and Dissolved White Sugar were more readily available on the market, and demand was sluggish. Asking prices were small, and each fell by 1-5 yuan. There was not much change in Medium and Coarse Sand sugar. Local sugar from Zhangzhou and green original factory white sugar were the only ones with strong sales, each rising by 10-15 yuan. There were no transactions in the remaining varieties.

### Shanghai Gold Control Bureau Investigates the Flow of Idle Capital in the Market

A General Inspection Will Be Implemented Soon

The current gold control policy will have some revisions, and the Ministry of Finance is currently drafting the revision methods. Once the new cabinet is formed, it will be submitted for discussion to complete the legislative procedures. Its basic spirit will take the articles stipulated in the Banking Law as the principle, focusing on diverting idle capital and transferring it to productive uses. Since Bi Delin took over the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau, all work has continued as usual. The current central task of the bureau is to investigate the flow of idle capital and the lending and borrowing business of banks and financial institutions. It is heard that a general inspection of financial institutions in the entire city will be implemented in the near future.

### Simplified Procedures for Overseas Chinese Investment in Domestic Enterprises

According to the Export-Import Management Commission, since the commencement of overseas Chinese investment in domestic production enterprises, it has generally been considered that the restrictions are too strict, so applicants are not very enthusiastic. In view of this, the Export-Import Management Commission has not only simplified the original application procedures, but also suggested to the Executive Yuan that the types of imported materials stipulated in the original annex to the regulations be relaxed. In the future, imported materials can also include those listed in Annexes (1), (2), and (3)A of the Export-Import Trade Regulations.

### Simplified Structure of Export-Import Management

The Export Trade Management Regulations have been approved and promulgated by the Executive Yuan for several days. It is now learned that the Export-Import Management Commission has formally received a clear order of approval from the Executive Yuan, and the Commission has decided that once the work of simplifying the structure and adjusting personnel is completed, it can be formally implemented. Before the reorganization is completed, all import and export management will still be handled in accordance with past methods.

### Export Trade Focus Gradually Reveals Signs of Shifting South

According to information from the Export Control Board: foreign exchange transfer certificates have been steadily rising this week (excluding December 13th to 18th). The export volume of this city is quite enthusiastic. The total value of foreign exchange settlement applications last week exceeded 7 million US dollars, which is unprecedented. However, goods arriving in various places are mostly stagnant. Even pig bristles, casings, feathers, and fur, which are currently in peak season, are scarce. It is rumored that a large number of materials from the southwest are now exported via Guangzhou, and the focus of export trade is gradually showing signs of shifting south.

As for the overseas market prices of our major export commodities, they are generally stable. According to a telegram received from London on Monday, Chongqing No. 27 Mixed Bristles are priced at 21 shillings per pound, Tianjin No. 55 Short Bristles at 50 shillings per pound, and Tianjin No. 26 Short Bristles at 40 shillings per pound. In addition, the feather market is strong, with grey duck feathers and white goose feathers priced at US$0.39 and US$0.59 per pound FOB, respectively.

### Woolen Textile Industry Faces Crisis

The woolen textile industry was once extremely prosperous, but the current situation has undergone a major change, and the industry has fallen into a difficult situation. According to people in the industry, the cost of the industry is too high, and selling its products at market prices would result in a loss of 20%. Moreover, due to transportation issues, internal transport is very difficult, and even if it arrives, there are few takers, so sales are very sluggish. Under these circumstances, the industry is extremely anxious, and it is difficult to maintain the current situation, so they have been reducing work. Many of the import quotas for the fifth and sixth seasons of the industry cannot be raised and settled.

### Woolen Fabric Transactions Sporadic

Due to various environmental factors, combined with the discount rate being lower than the interest rate of the exchange, and at the same time, since the price limit was lifted, compared with various commodity prices, the multiple of its increase is the smallest, and there is a high probability of falling again and not falling. As for actual business, there are still few wholesale transactions, and customers have successively stopped. Except for a few of the shops on this street, most of the shops are deserted for a while, resulting in only sporadic transactions and a lack of large-scale trading. At present, most stores adhere to the policy of selling before replenishing, and do not want to add inventory if there are no sales.

### Silk Steady

Yesterday, the price of rayon was quoted off-exchange, and the market was closed for the day, with no transactions, but people's minds were still stable, and transactions were rare.

The interbank forward price for 120 grade Tianqiao was quoted at 15,000 yuan, and Dongyang at 15,200 yuan. Other prices were quoted slightly higher by 200 to 300 yuan. The market was ostensibly up but actually flat.

The raw silk market was sluggish yesterday. Silver and money shops were closed, foreign firms did not quote prices, there were no reports of export transactions, and there were only a few sporadic transactions among domestic traders. The interbank forward price for Grade D 78 uniformity was quoted at 17,300 yuan, and premium spot goods at 16,800 yuan. The market was uneventful, with minimal fluctuations.

The silk and satin market was also quiet yesterday. Some retail investors sold off-exchange, and the market was slightly lower than on Saturday by 300 to 500 yuan. Meiya bed covers were quoted at 10,000 yuan, and Huaqiang at 9,800 yuan.

Most Silk Factories Still Profitable

According to the person in charge of the Silk Reeling Industry Association: Although the silk industry this year is not as good as last year, if it is operated prudently, it should not be a loss, and there is still a small profit to be made. If one relies on speculation or debt financing, then there will undoubtedly be a loss. Because the current fuel and wages are still stable, the Shanghai price is about 20,000 yuan per picul. If calculated according to net cost, there is still a profit of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

### Tea House Trading Begins, Cotton Cloth Initially Firm then Weak

Yesterday, the cloth market was closed for the day as usual due to the year-end interest settlement by banks. However, some trading took place at the Paradise Tea House. Four Gentlemen Yuan Piaoji initially traded 20 pieces at 496 yuan, and then rose to a maximum of 498 yuan, with a small amount of trading. Finally, selling pressure increased, and the price fell to 483 yuan. Dragon Head Fine Cloth was offered at 480 yuan, but there were even fewer transactions. The cloth stores' door sales were sluggish, and people's minds were unsettled. At the tea house, the colored corduroy cloth produced by private cloth factories had some transactions.

China Textile Corporation Suspends Allocation

Yesterday, all markets declared closed. The China Textile Corporation also suspended allocation for one day due to difficulties in delivery, and will resume as usual today.

### Daily Necessities Mediocre

Daily necessities were greatly affected by the closing of the market yesterday, and transactions were extremely mediocre. Cigarettes were priced flat and lacked the strength to rebound. Gu Ben closed at 303 yuan, scissors soap at 290 yuan, 120 Yellow Xiangmao at 245 yuan, Beautiful Matches rose slightly, closing at 1,550 yuan, Phoenix Matches at 1,500 yuan, and miscellaneous brands had little trading.

### Decline of the Hankou Casing Industry

Hoping for Government Loans and Tax-Free Salt Allocation

[Hankou Correspondence] According to a casing exporter in Hankou, the current casing export business is on the verge of its final demise. If the government does not take measures to save it, it will soon decline. Major casing factories in Hankou, such as Dechang, Fuxing, Chonglin, and Sanhe, are all reducing casing exports and shrinking their business scope. Taking Dechang as an example, before the war, it exported more than 200 barrels of casings per month (including the Chongqing factory) (an average of 600 pieces per barrel, totaling 2,500 pairs), but now it has been reduced to about 20 barrels. In the past, casing sales were mainly in Germany and France, and could also be sold in the UK, Belgium, Spain, and Portugal. After World War II, the UK banned the import of casings, and the people of other countries suffered hardships, resulting in a sharp decline in sales. Because the international casing market price is low, domestic casing factories dare not buy at high prices. Before the war, each pair of casings was about 3 French francs, but now it can only be bought in at 4 gold yuan per pair, and the price has fallen by about three times. The source of casings, in addition to Hankou itself, mostly relies on the countryside. At present, meat merchants in various places are not profitable, and most sell casings along with pork. In addition, the bandit areas have expanded, making it inconvenient for casing merchants to transport, and it is not easy to purchase. In addition to transportation and factory payments, refined salt expenses are an important item. Each barrel of casings requires 200 jin of refined salt. Major salt shops in Hankou are hampered by various difficulties and cannot sell in large quantities at lower prices. They have no choice but to seek it from the retail market at high prices, which increases the cost of making casings. In the past, each casing factory has done its best to use domestic unimportant materials (casings) to earn a large amount of foreign exchange for the government, which is beneficial to balancing international payments. Now facing a crisis, they still stick to their posts and try to struggle, hoping that the government, in line with the purpose of encouraging export business, will immediately provide support to each casing factory. On the one hand, implement low-interest loans, and on the other hand, allocate tax-free salt (Shanghai has a precedent), and provide convenience in transportation, in order to save the critical fate.

### Import Quotas for the Seventh and Eighth Seasons Can be Applied for in Other Ports

According to information from the Export Control Board: The import quotas for the seventh and eighth seasons have already been fully allocated. As for the industrial quotas, because the manufacturing industries have not yet agreed on the allocation, they have been submitted to the Import Quota Department for allocation. It is reported that more than 200 import quota cases approved by the quota allocation office have been issued import licenses by the visa office, but all applicants have not gone to collect them, which is the opposite of the past situation. It is said that this is due to waiting and seeing. However, according to the responsible authorities, if the applicants do not want to import in Shanghai, they can go through transit procedures at the visa office and import in other ports.

### Timber Arrivals Still Scarce

The timber market situation, during the bank closing and interest settlement period, trading was as usual. It is expected that various non-industry items may be seen higher after the opening, so traders are unwilling to depreciate prices. Fir strips are priced at 1.4 yuan and 1.3 yuan, and sales are quite good. The rumor that the cigarette factory is resuming work is rife, and there is also absorption in the tea house. The remaining goods are considered stable. However, arrivals are still scarce, presumably due to the impact of the situation, traders dare not purchase large quantities from the producing areas.

### Commercial Briefs

Sichuan wax has become more expensive due to rising production prices and transportation difficulties. Candle and tallow sales are exceptionally good. Yesterday, the market price for rice, cores, teeth, and opening and closing orders was 5,500 yuan per dan, up 500 yuan from Saturday.

The market for medicinal materials has been sluggish for a long time, and the addition of new allocations to other ports is still scarce. Sales of Huai Niuxi are not as good as last year, and even less than one-tenth of pre-war levels. The situation for the rest can be imagined. The market price is slightly firmer.

Sandalwood imports are trapped, and the road ahead is narrow, only reaching eight-tenths of previous years. Prices vary greatly.

### Fujian Timber Faces Crisis, Still a Glimmer of Hope

— Our Reporter Chen Xiaofeng

[Our Xiamen dispatch, 17th] The economic lifeline of Fujian Province is based on the income from overseas remittances in southern Fujian, and the export of special products in northern Fujian. In addition to tea, daffodils, oranges, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms, timber is the main export product of Fujian Province, most of which are inhaled and exhaled from Fuzhou. It not only maintains the lives of hundreds of thousands of carpenters in the vast area of Jianbei, but also supports the prosperity of the Fuzhou market.

Good Times Don't Last

But good times don't last. Currently, most of China is mired in the flames of war, and Tianjin and Shanghai, which are the largest markets for Fujian timber, have stopped all construction due to the war. Therefore, the route for Fujian timber has been cut off, and the export situation has fallen into an unprecedented predicament. Fuzhou, which has always been known as a timber distribution center, has 190 timber firms to date, all of which have been forced to stop. More than 90 of them are in a state of complete stagnation. In addition, more than 140 sawmills are also facing the same crisis and have closed down, directly affecting the lives of tens of thousands of workers who rely on sawmills for a living. This is indeed a serious problem in Fujian Province at present.

Workers' Lives

According to people with economic vision: The sluggish sales of timber are a harbinger of the economic crisis in Fujian Province. Jianbei produces a lot of timber every year. In addition to timber merchants who specialize in this business, there are no less than hundreds of thousands of carpenters who are responsible for clearing mountains, peeling, sawing barrels, dragging fences, releasing streams, and nailing picks. Timber farmers are not included. Once all timber sales are stopped, how will the lives of these hundreds of thousands of workers be solved? It seems difficult to avoid rural bankruptcy, and its impact on the social economy is even greater. At this time, the public security in Jianbei will face an unpredictable situation, which will obviously form a social and economic problem.

Stagnant Exports

The stagnation of timber is affected by the recent war in the north. In the past, the first target of exports of Fujian timber was Shanghai, followed by Tianjin, and then distributed to Niuzhuang, Yantai and other places, followed by Ningbo, Nantong, Taiwan and southern Fujian. In addition to general needs, mining used the most. However, today, "the war has affected mining work in the north, reducing demand, and it goes without saying for others, which has given Fujian timber a major blow.

Areas in the province that use Fuzhou timber are mostly Fuqing, Putian, Quanzhou and other places along the coast. In the past, because overseas remittances in southern Fujian were smooth, overseas Chinese areas were building on a large scale, and sales were quite good. Recently, due to the lack of overseas remittances, it has also been affected, but the number of sales is limited after all, so the price of timber in Fuzhou has plummeted. According to the current situation: timber is not as good as firewood. Firewood is priced at more than 20 yuan per dan, but timber must be worth about 12 yuan per tube, weighing about 120 jin, and then processed and sawn into firewood pieces to get more than double the price. In addition to wages, the price of the timber itself is completely lost, so timber merchants are unwilling to engage in this business again, and have changed their careers or quietly returned north. The Fuzhou market has also become depressed as a result. Recently, the business of Nantai KTV restaurants has been sluggish, which is very different from the golden age of soaring timber prices in August and September this year. It was only a short time ago, and the difference is like heaven and earth, which is unbearable to look back on.

Opening Up the Market

In the future, Taiwan will be a major sales market for timber. In the past, Taiwan did not need this kind of thick timber from Fujian because it built Japanese-style houses, so there was a saying that "good timber does not go to Taiwan". However, recently, a large number of people from Beijing and Shanghai have moved to Taiwan, and Taiwan is building on a large scale, and needs timber everywhere. Therefore, some Fuzhou timber merchants have gone to Taiwan to seek sales channels. In order to solve this serious problem, the Fujian Provincial Government also sent Chen Huazhou, a member of the Fujian Provincial Committee, to Taiwan on the 12th to discuss opening up the timber market. If successful, this is a glimmer of hope in the face of the crisis in Fujian timber. However, according to people engaged in this business, the current difficulty in the transportation of timber in this province is still the means of transportation. If this problem can be solved, Fujian timber still has great potential in Taiwan, and the crisis can be eliminated.

### Message from Hainan: A Letter from Fortress Commander Nie Qi to the Elders

— Xi Wen

[Our Jiayin dispatch, 19th] Nie Qi, former chief of staff of the Fortress Command, was transferred to the position of Hainan Island Fortress Commander in October of this year, and arrived in Yulin on November 3 to take over. He recently sent a letter to the elders of this county, reporting in detail on the current situation of the island. Here are the main points: Hainan Island is the southernmost end of China, located between 19 degrees and 9 minutes to 20 degrees and 7 minutes north latitude, and 108 degrees and 36 minutes to 111 degrees and 3 minutes east longitude. It is an oval-shaped island composed of the northeast Ganwei archipelago and the surrounding water islands, facing Tokyo and Taiwan from afar. It controls the Nanyang archipelago to the south, faces the Philippines to the east, and is separated from the Leizhou Peninsula by the Lei-Qiong Strait to the north. It is a strategic hub in the southwest Pacific. The island covers an area of about 97,198 square miles, and looking forward to Taiwan, which is 600 nautical miles away, is no less than the two eyes of the Republic of China, guarding the national defense sea frontier. It is indeed the most important part of the national defense economy.

Haikou Port is located at the northern end of the island and is the

Commercial Center

The humanities and philosophy are no less than those of inland cities. Qiu Gong Wen Zhuang and Hai Gong Zhongjie of the Ming Dynasty were born here, which is enough to add color to the island. Yulin Port is located at the southernmost end of the island and is the most important naval and air force base for national defense and military affairs. It is also the only base for controlling the South Pacific. It is remembered that during the Anti-Japanese War, when the Japanese enemy began to occupy the island, President Chiang Kai-shek made a statement to Chinese and foreign reporters, specially emphasizing that it was the "September 18 Incident" on the Pacific, and the importance of its position can be imagined. Jinlin Port is also a natural good military port. During the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian fleet once docked here. The current naval wharf in the port has been painstakingly built by the Japanese for many years. The water is deep and the port is wide, and it can berth battleships of more than 10,000 tons. Moreover, it is surrounded by mountains and water, and the terrain is majestic. There is no fear of hurricane attacks, and it is especially good for its beautiful scenery. It is truly a good port.

Qiong Island not only has

Natural seaports and large air force bases, but also a virgin land yet to be developed. The island is rich in mineral deposits. The Shilu iron ore in western Qiong and the Tiandu mine in Yulin in southern Qiong are the best in the world. The Hainan Iron Mine Bureau is now engaged in new mining methods, and the daily mining of ore sand is considerable, symbolizing the gratifying prospects of Chinese industry. The reserves of fishery and aquatic products are also the largest fishery station in South China. The Guangdong branch of the Fishery Administration is located in Yulin and is engaged in the development of fisheries. The salt pans in Yanya in southern Qiong and Changgan and Yinggehai in western Qiong are the largest in scale. The Japanese originally intended to create the second largest blue field in the world to supply their South Pacific and domestic military and civilian needs, but only completed one-tenth or two-tenths of the project, and the Japanese Kou announced their unconditional surrender. In the future, if the leadership can catch up quickly, on the one hand, use military force to wipe out scattered bandits, and on the other hand, engage in construction work, then the country and the people will benefit, and the future is limitless. In addition, there are coconuts, betel nuts, and jackfruits, etc.

Tropical Products

Which are not available in our inland China. It is also the only rubber producing area in our country, so in terms of national defense resources, it is indeed an important arsenal. In the past, the Japanese painstakingly built and various development and construction projects were somewhat based, but after the restoration, banditry spread, and development work could not be carried out. However, the government still kept the construction of Qiong Island in mind, and that is why. The climate of Qiong Island belongs to the sub-band, although it is close to the equator, it is not very hot due to the regulation of the Pacific sea breeze. Plants are suitable for growth, and it has the reputation of "summer is always summer, and autumn is formed after a rain". The islanders live honestly and simply, have the habit of being hardworking and enduring, and are especially full of awe-inspiring righteousness. The Li people in the hinterland live scattered in the deep mountains and wilderness, still living a primitive life, which is inherently in need of the authorities to actively carry out educational work. At present, the public security in Yanya in southern Qiong is still good. However, due to

Vast Defense Area

And a thin military force, bandits still harass from time to time, and I will uphold the revolutionary spirit, the duty of soldiers to protect the country and the people, and follow the instructions of the leadership to ensure public security, consolidate southern Qiong, seize the opportunity, and quell banditry, in order to relieve the government's southern concerns and to live up to the expectations of the people.

Recently, the flames of war have engulfed the earth. Since being transferred to Hainan, I have been 10,000 miles away. Every time I read the newspaper, I know the danger of the Huai River and feel the threat of the Jiangnan. I have never failed to

Across the River

The elders and brothers feel the wind and rain. The ancients said: "Born in adversity, die in ease and pleasure", and said: "Loyal ministers and illegitimate sons are worried about their hearts and think deeply", so the autumn of hardship and suspicion is a great opportunity for us to succeed and establish our careers. I hope that the elders of Jiangyin will uphold the spirit of cooperation between the military and the civilians in the past, and under the leadership of Commander Dai, rise up together to block the enemy in Jiangbei and eliminate banditry in the invisible. This is what I, the elders and brothers, expect day and night.

### A Shell Falls in Bangbu, Affecting Workers

[Our Zhazha Prefecture, 16th] A shocking tragedy suddenly occurred on Huada Street in this city. It turned out that at about 4:00 pm on the 16th, a twin-engine transport plane flew over the urban area when the engine suddenly failed, causing a box of bullets loaded for air delivery to fall from the plane and land on Huada Street. It happened that a city party department worker passed by Hongru Bank and was bombed to death. At that time, the flesh and blood were blurred, and the extremity was miserable. When the city party department heard the news, it ordered someone to carry the body to his home for burial. The person in charge of the party department has asked the garrison command to order the air force station to give preferential treatment to the bereaved.

### The Decline of Jiangxi Porcelain Industry: Provincial Government Proposes Establishing a National Kiln

Agricultural Reclamation Office to Assist with Drainage Projects

[Special Dispatch from Wuyuan, 15th of this month] The local porcelain industry is suffering as raw material and labor costs continue to rise each month. Porcelain prices have increased more than tenfold compared to before August 19th, resulting in little difference between production costs and sales prices. Winter sales in various regions have been sluggish for the past month. Currently, only about 20% of porcelain kilns are operating. In light of the decline of Jingdezhen porcelain, the Jiangxi Provincial Government has decided to establish a large-scale, modern kiln factory in Jingdezhen in the near future. It also proposes that the central government establish a national kiln to actively promote overseas trade. At the same time, funds will be allocated to expand the existing porcelain factories in Pingxiang and Jiujiang, enabling the porcelain industries in the three locations to develop together.

[Another Report] The Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Management Office of the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Committee recognizes Poyang Lake as the largest lake in central China's Yangtze River region. The lakeside terrain is low-lying, and to prevent floods and droughts and actively promote mechanized reclamation, it has been decided in consultation with the Jiangxi Provincial Government that the office will provide a large number of pumps and other machinery to assist in drainage projects in the lakeside areas.

[Another Dispatch] This county lacks grain, and in the past, it relied heavily on rice from Jiangxi. Now, the situation is reversed. Large quantities of rice from the southwest of the county are being transported for sale in Jingdezhen and Leping, leading to a depletion of reserves and severe food shortages in the northeast villages. The local authorities are currently taking measures to prevent this, including prohibiting the transportation of grain out of the county.

To prevent scattered bandits from Dexing, Kunshan, and the Wuyuan area from fleeing into the county, the county government has dispatched a self-defense squad to the Jiangwan and Duanshen areas in eastern Wuyuan to assist in the suppression efforts.

### Zhenjiang Business Corps to Be Established

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 19th of this month] The County Chamber of Commerce has decided to re-establish the Business Corps. It has already recruited 120 members, and the uniforms will be provided by the Chamber of Commerce. The corps will be established soon and will recruit more members to protect businesses and maintain public order.

### A Ruthless Analysis of the Pioneers in Xinjiang

— Liu Peiheng

[Air Dispatch from Dihua, 16th of this month] When I first arrived in Xinjiang, I was particularly struck by the group of Han Chinese, the so-called pioneers of the frontier, even more so than by the Uyghurs with their typically Western high-bridged noses. Several phenomena, more corrupt than in the interior by several degrees, caused me pain, sorrow, and even a sense of despair. In my previous dispatches to newspapers in the interior, I had occasionally mentioned the living conditions of our Han Chinese compatriots in Xinjiang, but they were too brief and disorganized to leave a lasting impression. Therefore, I am now providing a more systematic report for readers who are concerned about the frontier regions.

Increase in the Han Chinese Population

In recent years, the number of Han Chinese migrating here has increased steadily, making previous statistics unreliable. According to a survey conducted by Professor Chen Chengzhi of Xida University up to 1946, there were 202,239 people. However, the current number is likely approaching 300,000. These Han Chinese live primarily in the areas centered around Dihua, distributed throughout northern Xinjiang in Qitai, Suilai, Hugangbi, and Zhenxi, with a small number also in Hami in eastern Xinjiang. In southern Xinjiang, except for a few major cities, there are hardly any Han Chinese. Among these Han Chinese compatriots, the largest group is merchants, followed by military and government personnel, and then a portion who are overseas Chinese returning from the Soviet Union. Most of the merchants migrated to Xinjiang during the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China. Some came to Xinjiang for political or military service and later changed occupations, while others came from Tianjin and Shandong to seek gold. Having lived in Xinjiang for a long time and established families, they have settled down, partly due to the inconvenience of transportation and partly because Xinjiang is a virgin land waiting to be developed, where all kinds of businesses are easier to develop than in the interior, and where doing business is particularly profitable. As a result, they have registered as residents and become quasi-Xinjiang people. These Han Chinese have a much better environment than the native people of Xinjiang and wield economic power, so they often regard themselves as an "elite" ethnicity and become the darlings of Xinjiang. However, these darlings have also been taught a lesson. During the Yining Incident in 1944, many Han Chinese in the Yining, Tacheng, and Altai regions were killed, and those who fled after the peace treaty was signed were all bankrupt. During the most critical moments of the 1941 incident, Han Chinese in Dihua and the northern areas fled to the interior en masse. It was not until the signing of the peace treaty that they calmed their fears and gradually returned to Xinjiang.

After this lesson, one would expect the Han Chinese to have a new understanding of the frontier issues and to be more vigilant psychologically. However, this is not the case. Especially in recent years, waves of high-ranking military and government officials and so-called "pioneers of the frontier" have come west, bringing with them all the corrupt practices of the interior. The convergence of the "two Hans" means that everything found in the interior is now also in Xinjiang. Gluttony, bribery, drug use, smuggling, eating, drinking, prostitution, gambling—nothing is inferior to the interior, especially in Dihua, the nerve center of Xinjiang.

Inharmonious Phenomena

People living in the interior generally assume that Xinjiang has a special environment and that social phenomena must also be somewhat different, but this is not the case at all. The things you cannot stand in the interior can all be found here. In the interior, are personnel problems such as "factionalism" and "infighting" not common? Here, it is not limited to personnel matters, but also involves "political" and "ethnic" issues. Despite the lack of talent in Xinjiang, the phenomenon of overstaffing has not diminished. In Dihua, I have a friend who is a mid-level official in a certain agency. I see that he is already idle enough all day long, but the agency he works for is still recruiting staff. I asked him, "Why are you still hiring people?" He said that they are still far from reaching the authorized staffing level. This has created an inharmonious phenomenon in Xinjiang, a kind of deformed development!

Appalling Social Atmosphere

In Xinjiang, I feel that the Han Chinese friends I have met are wealthier than those in the interior. Even a very low-level civil servant or a humble military officer will spend money like water. Their generosity makes me feel ashamed. I seem so stingy and unworldly. "Where do they get so much money?" This remains a question. Is it from corruption? Perhaps some, but I am sure that this is not entirely the case, because I know that many people are indeed very poor. Why is a poor young man so indifferent? Perhaps it is the social atmosphere! However, what you find most unbearable are those fat merchants and some high-ranking officials. Their corrupt appearance will truly surprise you. Of course, there is no shortage of wise people among the high-ranking officials who care about and understand the frontier, but they are too few. The vast majority are focused on how to "get promoted," "get rich," and "find women" (especially "find second wives"). You can see their shadows in dance halls and luxury hotels, places where it is easiest to spend money. In Dihua, a mid-level military officer told me that if a military officer in Dihua does not know how to dance, it is considered the biggest defect. As for gambling, Han Chinese in Xinjiang have more gambling equipment than in the interior. The wealthy play mahjong or poker, while the lower classes squat at the base of the city walls to roll dice or bet on numbers. Even the soldiers guarding the city are playing cards under the city tower. I stayed in a very small county for a few days and saw the way the Han Chinese there gamble, and it was truly shocking. Merchants, soldiers, and civil servants gather together to gamble every day. They spend most of their days on this, and everything else seems to be irrelevant to them!

Hoping for More Effort

Before I came to Xinjiang, I thought that the Han Chinese in Xinjiang would have a deeper understanding of the "Xinjiang problem" than people in the interior, because living in such a complex "ethnic" and "political" region would foster a complex mindset due to the complex environment. However, I was completely wrong. The Han Chinese merchants in Xinjiang are no different from the unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai. They are adept at "hoarding," "profiteering," and "creating black markets," even more daring than the merchants in Shanghai, because there is no stimulation of war here, and little criticism from public opinion. The authorities sometimes do not even dare to swat a fly. This is truly sad.

I love Xinjiang, so I am particularly struck by the pioneers of Xinjiang. Perhaps my words are a bit harsh, but the purity of my heart and the urgency of my expectations should be self-evident. I hope that the young people of Xinjiang will make more efforts!

### Chengyou Wins Main Game of the Morning Friend Cup, 44-37 Reversal

[News from this Newspaper] In the decisive battle of the Morning Friend Cup Basketball Tournament last night, Chengyou defeated Renyu 44-37, reversing the defeat. In the first half, Renyu led Chengyou by one point, 17-16. There were over a thousand spectators at the Municipal Gymnasium, and the atmosphere was quite lively. In the first half, Chengyou's shooting and free throws were too unreliable, missing many good opportunities. In the second half, they gradually improved. After six ties, Chengyou finally reversed the defeat with a score of 44-37, creating a record of eight wins in eight games. There is still one game left against Jianle, and if they win, the championship will be no problem. In another Group A game, Peier defeated Lehe 50-42, and in Group B, Shanhei defeated Xinxin 49-21.

Renyu Fights Hard, Takes One-Point Lead

In the key game between Chengyou and Renyu, the referees were Liu Hesheng and Zheng Zhifang. Renyu had momentum, but missed two shots. Chengyou countered, with He Zeng and Fu Qixia making free throws, scoring three consecutive points. Renyu's Wu Xinyun and Li Zhaohe followed suit, returning three points. Soon, Xinyun added another basket, and with two consecutive free throws, Renyu gradually took the lead at 7-3. Wang Rongsheng and Liang Rongbiao followed closely, making it 7-6. Chengyou called a timeout. He Zeng tied the score at 7-7, and Wang Huaiding added a point for Renyu. Chengyou called another timeout, with the score at 15-12. Wang Bingfu made a shot. When the opponent's Xinyun scored again, Renyu led by five points, making it 15-10. Chengyou panicked and called a third timeout, with the score at 15-12. He Zeng and Wang Bingfu made two free throws, and Liang Rongbiao scored, making it 16-15. Xinyun scored another basket, and Renyu still led by 17-16, with a narrow one-point lead.

Six Ties, Chengyou Takes the Lead

In the second half, Renyu's Wang Huaiding immediately scored a basket. Wang Rongsheng and He Zeng tied the score at 19-19, and then again at 21-21 and 23-23, for a total of six ties. Bingfu and He Zeng scored three consecutive times, making it 29-23. Rongsheng was ejected for committing five fouls and replaced by Shi Jiuquan. Xinyun and Bingfu competed fiercely, making it 33-26. Chengyou's score continued to rise from there. Shen Pengju replaced Li Zhaohe. Soon, Xinyun committed five fouls, and Zhaohe re-entered. In the last ten minutes, Renyu's momentum was exhausted. The score was 38-27. Sun Moses replaced Liang Rongbiao, making it 40-27. He Zeng committed five fouls, and Ji Youkun entered the game. With only five minutes remaining, the opponent's two strong players left the game one after another, which was a good opportunity for Renyu. However, the score difference was too great to make a difference. Chengyou won against Renyu with a score of 44-37.

### Silver Coin Cup Table Tennis Tournament: Zhongguo Huang and Zhejiang Xing Lead the Pack

Recent Developments in the Finals

The second Silver Coin Cup Table Tennis Tournament has already started the finals. Except for the Chunmao team, which has withdrawn, the six strongest teams, including Zhongguo Huang, Shanghai, Citibank (Silver Group), Zhejiang Xing (Coin Group), Siming, and Jiaotong (Industry Group), will compete in a single round-robin to determine the final rankings. Currently, the Zhongguo Huang and Zhejiang Xing teams are considered the best, each leading the pack with three wins in three matches. Siming, the third-place finisher from the previous tournament, is closely following behind, maintaining an unbeaten record with two wins in two matches. The Shanghai team has emerged as a dark horse in this tournament. Players such as Ling Kecheng, Chen Quan, and Yang Yongkang are physically strong and have plenty of stamina. Under the guidance of coach Mei, they have defeated the strong Citibank team twice, which is an amazing feat. They only have one match left against Jiaotong, and they are likely to win, securing fourth place without any problems. The recent standings of the six strongest teams are recorded below:

Team Name | Played | Won | Lost
---|---|---|---
Zhongguo Huang | 3 | 3 | 0
Zhejiang Xing | 3 | 3 | 0
Siming | 2 | 2 | 0
Shanghai | 4 | 1 | 3
Citibank | 4 | 1 | 3
Jiaotong | 4 | 0 | 4

The Qingbai vs. Railway match on Saturday was originally scheduled for the previous week (5th), but was postponed due to rain. Both teams in Group A have maintained an unbeaten record with six wins in six matches, forming a standoff. This match is the decisive battle of the first round in Group A. Qingbai, the leader of the football scene, cherishes its reputation, while the Railway generals are ambitious to replace it. The meeting of the two winning teams will inevitably lead to a fierce battle, and the outcome of this match will reveal who will ultimately prevail.

At 9:00 a.m. on Sunday, Qunli will face Zhichao, which is the last match of the first round in Group A. The two teams are evenly matched and should be worth watching. At 2:30 p.m., the Winter Relief Charity Match was initiated by Mayor Wu and organized by the Football Committee. Hualian will face Xilian. The lineups of the two teams are currently being selected and organized separately by the Football Committee and the Western Sports Association of the Racecourse. It is hoped that they will be produced and announced soon. A gathering of famous Chinese and Western players in one match, competing for victory, will surely satisfy the eyes of the city's football fans with its excitement and tension.

### Hong Kong Sports Association Achieves Unity: New Board Holds First Meeting

[Air Dispatch from Hong Kong] After the Hong Kong Sports Association branch's re-election experienced twists and turns, the first board meeting after unity was held on the evening of the 9th at the Jiasan South China Stadium. Cai Huihong, Zhong Zhiqiang, Ye Jiugao, Pan Yongkai, Zeng Jingkang, Lin Zhonghao, Yang Rong, Hu Zujian, Mo Yinghuai, Shi Puhui, Lai Duanfu, Lai Rurong, He Jingbo, Li Yuda, Liao Yankai, Zhang Jintian, Huang Shaoxiong, and Zhang Hualun attended. Cai Huisheng presided over the meeting. The meeting began with a report by Cai Huihong. Zhong Zhiqiang continued to read out the list of directors that each association had sent to the association and recognized as attending the association. The list is as follows: Xingdao: Cai Huihong, Li Hangan; Nanhua: He Jingbo, Mo Qing (resigned, replacement pending); Guanghua: Zhang Hanwei, Liao Yankai; Zhongsheng: Mo Qingwei, Li Xianliang; Jiezhi: Song Zixian, Zhao Qiwen; Football Association: Zeng Jingkang, Feng Shaokang; Small Ball Club: Lai Rurong, Zhang Hualun; Zhonghua: Ye Jiugao, Li Yuda; Bus: Yang Rong, Lei Jinhua; Taikoo: Lin Zhonghao, Zhang Hanqi; Zhonghua Amusement Club: Li Junjie.

After reading out the list of directors from each association, the first item passed was the approval of the new officers elected on November 10. The following is the full list of key officers of the association:

Chairman Cai Huihong, Vice Chairman Pan Yongkai, Secretary-General Zhong Zhiqiang, Treasurer Mo Qingwei. Football Director Ye Jiugao, Basketball Director Shi Zhenda, Volleyball Director He Jingbo, Baseball Director Li Yuda, Track and Field Director Lin Zhonghao, Swimming Director Huang Shaoxiong, Martial Arts Director Yang Rong, Small Ball Director Zeng Jingkang, Table Tennis Director Lai Rurong, Billiards Director Li Xianliang, Badminton Director Li Junjie, Boxing Director Hu Zujian.

During the ratification, Zhong Zhiqiang firmly offered his resignation, but everyone felt that even if he wanted to resign, he should postpone it until the next board meeting. Zhong Zhiqiang postponed this decision. The second item was the election of standing directors. There are supposed to be seven standing directors, but the chairman, vice chairman, secretary-general, and treasurer are ex officio, so three more were elected to complete the number. The three elected were Ye Jiugao and Lin Zhonghao. The third item raised by someone in attendance was about the previous decision by the association for Cai Huihong, Mo Yinghuai, and He Jingbo to be responsible. It was now decided to expedite this process and these three committee members would work with the directors of the Zhonghua Amusement Club attending the association to handle the matter jointly. Fourth, Mo Yingwei proposed that since the directors of each department had been elected, the responsible persons should organize at least one successful event each year.

Arranging the Lineup for the Governor's Cup

In addition, there are two other issues that need to be resolved. One is the new membership. The Table Tennis Federation wants Yu to join and is leaving it to the joint meeting of directors and supervisors to review and approve. As for the issue of the association's address, Cai Huihong felt that it was not easy to find one at the moment and decided to first seek the consent of the following four associations: Nanhua Association, Liaosheng Society, Youth Association, and Zhonghua Amusement Club, and choose one of them as a temporary address.

Finally, it was decided that the Governor's Cup would begin its first battle this Sunday at the Flower Market. The Western Union team's lineup has already been selected by the General Association. The Association decided to have the standing directors hold an ad hoc meeting to select officials in consultation with people involved in football. Everyone felt that victory was essential in the first battle and decided to select the strongest lineup to play and also decided to send a letter to the General Association requesting 30 tickets for the match that day for the directors to enter the venue.

### Our Boxer Yang Guigang Makes His Debut in Bangkok

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 19th] Our country's world champion contender in the light welterweight boxing class, Yang Guigang, fought once tonight with the renowned Siamese boxer Nai Fo-fu La-pan-na-ying, engaging in a fierce ten-round battle, which resulted in a draw. Nai Fo-fu La-pan-na-ying is the Siamese light welterweight champion and the teacher of Nai Tuan-xi Feng, who was defeated by Yang on November 21st. Nai Tuan-xi Feng's weight greatly exceeded the light welterweight limit. Yang Guigang should accept Nai Fo-fu La-pan-na-ying's challenge; his technique in defeating Nai Fo-fu La-pan-na-ying, in terms of Siamese boxing, is far superior to international style.
