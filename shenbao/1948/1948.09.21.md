### Song Xilian to Organize Army Corps in Xiangyang: Responsible for Clearing Northern Hubei; Large-Scale Suppression War to Begin in Western Hubei; Sun Zhen to Proceed from Chengdu to Yichang to Oversee Operations

[Special Dispatch from Xiangyang, 20th] Reliable sources confirm that Song Xilian, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Suppression Headquarters, will soon come here to organize a powerful army corps, responsible for the suppression of northern Hubei. Yang Gancai, commander of a certain army corps currently stationed here, is designated as the deputy commander of the army corps.

[Another Telegram] The outskirts of Xiangfan are calm. Yang Gancai, commander of the Xiangyang garrison, has great confidence in the safety of Xiangfan. It is too early to say that the highway between Baihe and Laohekou has been cleared. However, the remnants of the bandits on the border between Shaanxi, Henan, and Hubei are fleeing to the upper reaches of the Xiang River in western Henan after the National Army recovered Yifan and the forces of Fang Jing from Sichuan and Shaanxi swept northward. The National Army can control them at any time.

[Another Telegram] It has been over a month since Xiangyang was recovered, and everything has returned to normal. However, in order to undermine the new currency system, the communist bandits tear up or confiscate all legal tender with a face value of over 500,000 yuan or gold yuan notes held by merchants and civilians passing through the bandit areas, resulting in a shortage of materials here, insufficient circulation of small legal tender, and soaring prices of all goods, which have increased more than four times compared to the time of recovery.

[Special Dispatch from Yichang, 20th] The situation in western Hubei is changing, and a large-scale suppression war is about to begin. (1) A crack unit of Yang Gancai's army corps stationed in Xiangfan has been sweeping through Nanzhang in three routes, north and south, for several days, capturing a considerable number of bandits. Its northern wing has reached the vicinity of Cihe Lishan Shop. (2) A crack unit that was recently transferred from central Hubei and stationed in Jingmen arrived in Dangyang on the 19th and will soon take action towards Ju'an. (3) In order to clear the remnants of Huang Dekui's bandits entrenched on the border of the four counties of Jingmen, Dangyang, Nanzhang, and Yuan'an, the Central China Suppression Headquarters has decided to establish a joint defense and suppression department for the four counties of Jing, Dang, Nan, and Yuan, to unify the command of the local armed forces in the four counties and cooperate with the National Army to eliminate the remnants of the bandits. Approximately 2,000 bandits under Li Zhenggan and others, who were originally entrenched in the Jianghan First District, were strongly searched and suppressed by the National Army. After crossing the Xiang River and fleeing west to Herong Town, they were threatened by the garrison troops between Jingmen and Dangyang and have already fled north to Yanchi Temple, north of Jingmen, and crossed the Xiang River back to their old nest in the Dahong Mountains.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 20th] Military news: The bandits who fled to Shiping, Fang County, western Hubei, were counterattacked by local forces and retreated to Baokang. Also, bandits from Hehua Shop in Yuan'an once fled to Jiangkou in Zhijiang County but have now fled to Jiangjiaji in southern Jingmen after being routed. Another report: The bandits of Kong in southern Shaanxi attempted to invade Baihe but are being fiercely attacked by the National Army.

[Special Dispatch from Yichang, 20th] The first batch of office staff of Sun Zhen, the newly appointed Director of the Sichuan-Hubei Border Region Pacification Headquarters, will arrive in Yichang today and tomorrow. Sun himself has also sent a telegram to all sectors of Yichang, stating that he will come to Yichang to oversee operations after all office staff have arrived. According to reports, Sun is currently in Chengdu, consulting with relevant parties on all matters related to the suppression of the Sichuan-Hubei border region. It is also learned that a crack unit of Sun's troops stationed in Henan will also be dispatched to Yichang to increase defenses.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] After the measures for increasing capital for banks and land development firms were set, banks and land development firms in Chongqing requested the government to reduce the capital amount, citing their inability to raise funds. Xu Kan, while supervising economic control in Chongqing, the Chongqing banks and land development firms made the aforementioned request to Xu. According to Xu Baiyuan, Deputy Minister of Finance acting on behalf of the minister, speaking to reporters on the 20th, the government's measures for increasing capital for banks and land development firms have already been considerably relaxed. If any banks or land development firms request a reduction, the government will definitely not consider it.

### Pingbao Line Enters Bandit Suppression Phase; National Army and Local Forces in Chengde Scour the Area

[Special Dispatch from Baoding, 20th] The National Army on the Pingbao Line is responding to each other from the north and south to suppress the remnants of the bandits. The National Army in northern Baoding is sweeping the periphery of Xushui, and the National Army going south is searching and suppressing the Seventh Bandit Column on the east side of the Pingbao section in the middle area of Xushui, Rongcheng, and Dingxing.

### The 84th Division of the Garrison on the Southwestern Outskirts of Jinan; Wu Huawen's Unit Defects; Most Officers and Soldiers Continue to Fight

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] According to the Ministry of National Defense, Commander Wang Yaowu of Jinan reported that on the afternoon of the 19th of this month, Deputy Division Commander Yang of the 84th Division reported that Division Commander Wu Huawen was colluding with communist bandits and attempting to defect. He immediately summoned him to the headquarters for a face-to-face meeting. At that time, Wu was holding a meeting of officers at the front line. Upon hearing that he was summoned to the headquarters for a meeting, he realized his guilt and immediately led approximately 2,000 officers and soldiers to defect to the bandits. Because most officers and soldiers understood the greater good, they were not deceived by him, and many have automatically returned, including Yang Youbai, commander of the 155th Brigade, and Wang Yucheng and Wang Tongyu, commanders of the regiment, as well as soldiers of over two battalions. The division is still under the command of Deputy Division Commander Yang and continues to fight. Yang Tuan, the regimental commander, has been promoted to the division commander of the 84th Division, and an official order is requested to be issued for the arrest of Wu Huawen.

[Another Telegram] According to reliable military sources: Wu Huawen, who was ordered to defend near Tushan (southeast of Changqing) on the southwestern outskirts of Jinan, was originally a former subordinate of Han Fuqu. He surrendered to the Japanese during the War of Resistance Against Japan and was appointed as a puppet army division commander. After the Japanese surrender, he was once again generously accepted and reorganized by the government. When Hao Pengju defected to the bandits, he conspired with him. During this Jinan outer perimeter battle, he was bewitched by treacherous bandits and led approximately 2,000 of his troops to defect to the bandits. Currently, the National Army on the southwestern outskirts of Jinan continues to fight according to the original plan, and the battlefield is not affected.

### Finance Minister Wang to Proceed to Shanghai and Then to the United States to Preside Over the Annual Meeting of the Two International Financial Institutions; Before Leaving Beijing, He Paid Respects to the President for Instructions

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] Finance Minister Wang Yunwu will take the night train to Shanghai on the 20th and is scheduled to fly to the United States on the morning of the 22nd to attend the Third Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Before leaving Beijing, Wang paid respects to the President around 7:00 PM on the 20th to bid farewell and seek further instructions on various related issues for attending the meeting abroad. He still went to the ministry to work on the morning and afternoon of the 20th. Yu Hongjun also visited Wang at the Ministry of Finance for several tens of minutes around 10:00 AM on the 20th.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] Finance Minister Wang Yunwu stated at a farewell party for senior officials of the Ministry of Finance at 5:30 PM on the afternoon of the 20th: I am leaving the country for a short period of time, and I am deeply grateful for everyone's farewell. Today marks the one-month anniversary of the promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs. The currency reform has been going on for a month. Looking back, we are pleased that the people are patriotic and support the government's policies, actively exchanging gold, silver, and foreign currencies for gold yuan notes. The new currency has achieved initial success. However, in order to achieve economic stability, it is not only necessary to reform the currency system but also to coordinate with balancing the budget and controlling prices. Although initial success has been achieved, we must continue to work hard. Wang continued: Now is the time to implement financial and economic reforms, and the Ministry of Finance is an important department of the implementing agency. My colleagues are working very hard. I am uneasy about leaving the country at this time. However, this International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Board of Directors meeting is convened by China, and the Chinese Minister of Finance is the chairman of the meeting, so I have to participate. This trip is only to attend the meeting, and I will be back within two weeks, or at most three weeks. During my absence, Deputy Minister Xu Baiyuan will act on my behalf. I am very pleased. Deputy Minister Xu is one of the participants in the planning of the various programs of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs, and he has planned with me from beginning to end. He is also the Secretary-General of the Economic Control Commission, and I believe that he will be able to perform this program with great success. Wang also praised Deputy Minister Li for his assistance to the ministry and finally encouraged all his colleagues to complete the task of reforming the currency system. All the chiefs of the various departments and offices of the Ministry of Finance, counselors, secretaries, and assistants attended the farewell party on the 20th.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The Third Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development will be held in Washington, D.C., at the end of this month. In addition to the chief delegate, Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, the Chinese delegation also includes Xi Demao and Song Ziliang as delegates, and Gu Yiqun, Shen Yuanding, Zhang Yuelian, Yu Guohua, and Zhang Tianze as consultants. Zhang Tianze will also serve as the acting chairman of the meeting, which will be assumed by China. This was determined at the Second Annual Meeting held in London in September last year. This is also an important reason why Wang Yunwu must attend in person. He told reporters this morning: "There are so many things at home. After the currency reform, many, many tasks must be handled or supervised personally. However, this year's meeting is our turn to chair, so I have to attend in person. However, my stay in the United States will not be very long. The meeting will last for two weeks, and I may return to China before the meeting closes. In any case, I will definitely be able to return to Nanjing before the Double Ten Festival." It can be said that it is an honor for our country to serve as chairman in international meetings and is also our country's responsibility to world affairs, so Minister Wang must personally participate. Both the first and second annual meetings of the agency were chaired by the United States and the United Kingdom in turn. At that time, US Treasury Secretary Vinson and British Finance Minister Dalton also attended in person.

### We Have No Proposals at the Meeting

This year's annual meeting is a routine meeting. Minister Wang said: "Our country has no proposals at this meeting." The agenda of this year's meeting will likely be to discuss the issue of new member countries joining and general issues related to the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

The International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development were established on July 1, 1944, at the "United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference" held in Bretton Woods, USA. At that time, people around the world placed great hope in the meeting, so President Roosevelt said in a letter to the representatives of 44 countries attending the opening of the conference: "This meeting is an important stage in guaranteeing the realization of the various necessary measures of an orderly and harmonious world. Commerce is the lifeblood of a free society, and we must ensure that the arteries that transport blood are no longer blocked by artificial barriers created by meaningless economic competition as in the past. Only with mobile standards can we raise these arteries to the extent that we can fully realize our future hopes." However, since the establishment of the above-mentioned institutions three years ago, the situation has not been as ideal. The most unfortunate encounter first is that the Soviet Union, one of the five world powers, has not participated. Secondly, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development's loans to member countries have not been satisfactory, and the International Monetary Fund's work on stabilizing the exchange rates of various countries has not achieved the expected results. Trade between countries and the United States has been one-sided.

The purpose of the establishment of the International Monetary Fund is to promote international exchange, stabilize and facilitate the development of international trade. If there is an imbalance in international payments, the member country can use the fund to correct it, so it focuses on short-term loans. The total fund of the association is 8.8 billion US dollars, which is paid by the United Nations and its sponsoring countries. The most is the United States, with a total of 750 million, followed by the United Kingdom, 1.3 billion, the Soviet Union, 1.2 billion, China, 540 million, France, 450 million, and India, 400 million.

### Li Dang Replaces the Director of the Salt Administration; Miao Qiujie Suspended from Duty Due to Corruption; Finance Minister Wang Appoints Commissioners for a Thorough Investigation

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] Miao Qiujie, Director of the Salt Administration under the Ministry of Finance, was ordered to be suspended from duty by Finance Minister Wang Yunwu on the 20th due to suspected illegal dereliction of duty and corruption. At the same time, Standing Deputy Minister Li Dang was designated to temporarily serve concurrently as the Director of the Salt Administration. This decision was made by Wang Yunwu, Xu Baiyuan, and Li Dang on the morning of the 20th and was announced that afternoon. When Miao Qiujie served as the Director of the Sichuan-Kangding Salt Administration in 1939, he was dismissed from his post by the Central Civil Service Disciplinary Committee for a case and was suspended from employment for one year. Later, with legal approval, the execution was temporarily suspended. Recently, someone secretly reported to Minister Wang, recounting Miao's illegal dereliction of duty and corruption. Some people also distributed leaflets under the name of the "Anti-Corruption Corps of the Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance," attacking Miao Qiujie for corruption, dereliction of duty, illegality, abuse of power, extravagance, and favoritism. After receiving the report, Minister Wang paid close attention and has sent two commissioners for a thorough investigation. Deputy Minister Xu Baiyuan stated on the 20th: The government is determined to earnestly rectify the salt administration. On the one hand, it is necessary to ensure that salt taxes are fully collected and, on the other hand, to save unnecessary expenses, so that the increased salt taxes can truly replenish the national treasury revenue.

### Assisting Members in Construction and Development

The purpose of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is to assist member countries in construction and development within their territories, guarantee or participate in private foreign loans and private investments, encourage international investment, develop the productive resources of member countries, and assist member countries in converting their wartime economies into peacetime economies, so it focuses on long-term loans, assisting the construction and development of industrially backward countries. The total capital of the bank is set at 10 billion US dollars, which is allocated to various member countries. Among them, the United States is allocated 3.175 billion, the United Kingdom is allocated 1.3 billion, the Soviet Union is allocated 900 million, and China is allocated 600 million.

The more the fund allocation in the Fund is, the better, but the less the fund allocation in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is, the better. The size of the former's allocation determines a country's voting rights and the amount of borrowing in the future, but the larger the latter's allocation, the greater the risk. Therefore, countries had great disputes over this allocation at the meeting. The most intense dispute was with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's fund allocation in the Fund was originally set at 850 million US dollars. After the Soviet representatives fought hard, it was decided to increase it to 1.2 billion yuan, which is 350 million more than the original amount. However, when allocating the capital amount in the International Bank, the Soviet side disregarded its allocated ratio in the Fund and tried to reduce it, and finally reduced it to 900 million yuan. As for our country, the fund allocation in the Fund is only 550 million. Compared with our country's population, trade, and resources, we should have received a larger allocation. Therefore, our country's representatives at that time put forward reservations on the allocation amount, but later, in order to "cooperate" with friendly countries 100%, we made a major sacrifice and withdrew the reservations, but then we assumed a huge number of 600 million yuan in the capital allocation of the International Bank, which exceeded the fund amount of 50 million US dollars that our country planned to allocate in the Fund. This is enough to show that our country is willing to bear greater obligations for international affairs.

### We Can Request Reconstruction Loans

The payment of the International Monetary Fund's funds and the International Bank's capital are made in gold and the currencies of the member countries. Our country has already paid the allocation of the International Bank's capital. If we need to borrow from the International Bank, our country is qualified for this. Although our country has not yet paid the allocated amount of funds to the International Monetary Fund, the number of gold and US dollars required to be paid is not large, and our country can pay it at any time. However, our country previously applied to the International Monetary Fund for a delay in the statutory valuation of our country's currency because the currency issue was still pending resolution. The association has agreed to give our country "time for long-term consideration," and member countries whose exchange rates have not yet been determined are allowed to postpone the payment of allocations. However, our country's currency has now been reformed and has achieved ideal success. Before the currency reform, we also notified the Board of Governors of the Fund and received its approving reply. Therefore, the amount of funds that our country should pay can be considered for payment. Therefore, the issue that the people of our country are concerned about is whether our country can request a long-term reconstruction loan from the International Bank or propose a short-term loan from the Fund to stabilize the currency system. In the former, our country has this qualification, and in the latter, our country can consider it.

### Censure for Leaking the Secret of Currency Reform; The Control Yuan Releases the Review Report; Requesting Penalties for Wang Yunwu, Wang Aotang, and Shen Yunlong

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] After Supervisory Committee members Sun Yulin and Tang Honglie investigated and solved the case of leaking the secret of currency reform and submitted a censure case, the Control Yuan issued a review report on the case on the 20th. The Supervisory Committee members responsible for the review were Chen Fangxian, Zhang Xiulan, and Chen Tingbi. The full text of the review report is as follows:

"After the members of the Committee reviewed the case of dereliction of duty by Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, etc., which was censured by Committee members Sun Yulin and Tang Honglie, all agreed that: This time, the various measures of the government's currency reform were all important decisions aimed at addressing the current malpractices. Finance Minister Wang has been diligent in overseeing the matter. However, these national policies are related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and how important are they? Secrecy should be strictly maintained beforehand. However, the Minister used people inappropriately, resulting in the leakage of secrets, and it is difficult to absolve him of the responsibility of negligence. Furthermore, Wang Aotang, the supervisor stationed by the Ministry in the Shanghai Stock Exchange, failed to fulfill his supervisory responsibilities beforehand, resulting in illegal trading. He also failed to conduct a thorough investigation afterward, which is a dereliction of duty. The original censure stated that the Minister's supervision was ineffective, his assessment was incomplete, and his employment was inappropriate, which is appropriate. Furthermore, the dereliction of duty by Shen Yunlong, the supervisor stationed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in the Shanghai Stock Exchange, is similar to that of Wang Aotang. It is requested that Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, Wang Aotang, the supervisor stationed by the Ministry in the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and Shen Yunlong, the supervisor stationed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in the Shanghai Stock Exchange, be transferred to the Executive Yuan for separate penalties."

### Kyoto Local Court Prosecutor's Office Summons Finance Minister Wang

A high-ranking official from the Ministry of Finance will appear in court on his behalf.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 20th] The Kyoto Local Court Prosecutor's Office is actively investigating the case of Xu Baiqi and Tao Qiming leaking information about currency reform. In addition to sending a letter to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office requesting the interrogation of Tao's wife, Li Guolan, the Kyoto side has recently decided to summon relevant finance officials in charge of the currency reform. The Prosecutor's Office has issued a summons for Finance Minister Wang Yunwu. It is understood that the interrogation may focus on the circumstances surrounding Finance Minister Wang's order for Xu Baiqi to draft the nationwide decree for the three-day closure of all money shops. However, Wang Yunwu left for Shanghai on the evening of the 20th to travel to the United States, so it is possible that another high-ranking official will appear in court on his behalf. Additional news: The Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office's reply to the interrogation of Tao Li Guolan has not yet arrived in Kyoto. Upon its arrival, further investigation will be conducted into Tao Qiming's movements before and after his flight to Shanghai.

### Budget Estimate for State-Owned Enterprises Returned to the Executive Yuan for Re-drafting; Joint Meeting of the Three Committees of the Legislative Yuan Decides

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 20th] The budget estimate for state-owned enterprises has been given to the Legislative Yuan for the budget. The joint review panel of the three committees of the Legislative Yuan-- Budget, Finance, and Economic Resources-- made its final review on the 20th and decided to return it to the Executive Yuan for re-drafting before submitting it to the Legislative Yuan for review. At the secret meeting on the morning of the 20th, chaired by Yin Shuxian, convener of the Budget Committee, with the attendance of more than 30 committee members, each sub-group first reported on the results of their departmental reviews. All agreed that the budget estimate submitted by the Executive Yuan lacked detailed information on the management regulations, business conditions, and development plans of the various state-owned enterprises. The various items of income and expenditure only listed the amounts in figures, and all were compiled in legal tender units before the currency reform, making the review very inconvenient. Therefore, it was unanimously decided to return it to the Executive Yuan. At the end of the meeting, Chen Kewen, Duanmu Jie, Lu Yuwen, and Yin Shuxian were appointed to be responsible for drafting the review report to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan. The report will explain the reasons for returning it to the Executive Yuan for re-drafting, and will also include review opinions, multiple suggestions for future improvements to state-owned enterprises, and a resolution to establish an investigation committee.

### Allocation of Taiwan Sugar and Taiwan Paper Stocks to Serve as New Taiwan Dollar Reserve

[Our Taipei Dispatch of the 20th] After the currency reform, the New Taiwan Dollar shows a tendency to inflate. According to the Bank of Taiwan, the central government will raise the issued amount to 58 billion yuan. Regarding the reserve issue, the Provincial Government previously suggested to the Resources Committee that stocks of Taiwan Sugar and Taiwan Paper companies worth 92 million gold yuan be allocated as legal tender reserves. This has been accepted by the boards of directors of both companies. The value of these stocks exceeds twice the amount of New Taiwan Dollars issued, thus strengthening the solvency of the New Taiwan Dollar.

### Stocks of State-Run Enterprises to Be Sold in Kyoto Starting Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 20th] Stocks of state-run enterprises, including China Textile, China Merchants, and five other entities, are scheduled to go on sale in Kyoto starting the 21st. The sales method is the same as that in Shanghai, with each company entrusting the National Bank to handle it in a coordinated manner, and then the National Bank entrusting the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Land Bank, China Trust Bureau, and Taiwan Provincial Bank to sell them. The stocks printed by each company arrived in Kyoto from Shanghai on the 20th, with a face value of 65 million gold yuan (this is the number allocated for the first phase in Nanjing). Regarding the technical issues of the sale, Yu Zhuangdong, Deputy Director of the National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank, invited representatives from various entrusted banks to discuss the matter on the morning of the 20th. It was decided to allocate more than 63 million yuan to various banks for sale, with the remaining one million yuan to be temporarily stored in the National Bank at various banks.

### Shenyang State-Run Bank Bureaus to Merge, Forming Joint Office

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, Dispatch of the 20th] The various state-run bank bureaus in Shenyang have recently received an order from the head office to merge in the near future, forming a joint office located within the Central Bank. It is also stipulated that all remittance businesses will henceforth be handled by the National Bank. This is because the previous bank bureaus no longer have any lending, storage, or remittance business to speak of. It is also learned that the offices of the various state-run bank bureaus in Changchun, except for the National Bank, have all been ordered to close.

### Exploring the Future of World Peace

——Congratulating the Opening of the Third Session of the United Nations General Assembly

The Third Session of the United Nations General Assembly opened at 3:00 PM today at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris. British Foreign Secretary Bevin, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, and our own Foreign Minister Wang Shijie have all led their delegations to Paris to attend today's opening of the United Nations General Assembly. Political diplomats from the 58 member states of the United Nations have gathered at the Palais de Chaillot to pool their wisdom and explore the future of world peace. This is truly a major international event. While observers generally expect this United Nations General Assembly to launch the most important diplomatic battle of 1948, with both the Eastern and Western blocs set to reveal their positions at this meeting, the opening of the United Nations General Assembly nonetheless brings unlimited hope. It goes without saying that those who yearn for world peace hold very urgent hopes for the opening of the General Assembly. Even those who have always lacked confidence in the United Nations cannot help but recognize that the opening of this General Assembly is a symbol of world peace, the only hope for mankind.

The United Nations was originally just a term, a kind of alliance formed by large and small countries to resist the aggression of Nazi Germany and Fascist Japan. It represents a hope for humanity: with it, humanity has the hope of not only having the certainty of winning the Second World War, but also the opportunity for people of all countries to live in peace, mutual assistance, and cooperation forever. Therefore, in the darkest period of the war, the morale of the front lines and the national sentiment of various countries were maintained by this name, this line of hope. At the San Francisco Conference in May 1945, the prototype of the United Nations had already taken shape, bringing more light and hope to the world. Even today, we still retain these sweet memories.

But after the United Nations was born on October 24, 1945, due to both congenital deficiencies and acquired maladjustments, the development and growth of the United Nations have failed to meet expectations in many ways over the past three years. The world's confidence and hope in it have also shaken with the decline of its prestige. I remember that when the United Nations General Assembly convened in 1946, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arbitrarily reduced the agenda, a phenomenon unprecedented in any international conference. In 1947, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky openly denounced prominent American figures as "war mongers" at the United Nations General Assembly, turning the atmosphere of the United Nations General Assembly from peace to hostility. Now everyone is worried and fearful, wondering what kind of shocking actions the Soviet delegation will take at the Third Session of the General Assembly. Therefore, to this day, the success or failure of the United Nations has become the focus of debate in the world.

In our fair opinion, observing from its bright side, in the past three years, the United Nations has indeed eliminated a lot of hatred, disputes, and wars among nations. In particular, the Security Council has been more successful than it has failed. In fact, there are the following items: (1) Mediating the Dutch-Indonesian conflict, ultimately achieving a peaceful resolution, saving 90 million Indonesians from the scourge of war; (2) Mediating the dispute between India and Pakistan, saving 400 million people in India and Pakistan from the catastrophe of civil war; (3) Mediating the Arab-Jewish war in Palestine, and finally obtaining acceptance from both sides; (4) Resolving the Iranian, Syrian, and Lebanese issues. In addition, it has also made considerable achievements in promoting international economic development, cultural exchange, and understanding and cooperation among people, which no one can deny.

But observing from its dark side, the future of the United Nations is still difficult to escape the same fate as the League of Nations. Restricted by the "veto power," it has failed to exert its effectiveness as an international organization from beginning to end. When encountering issues related to the five major powers, as long as one power expresses dissent and exercises its unique "veto power," it cannot be resolved. This is the reason why many important issues have been delayed since the war. Taking the agenda of this General Assembly as an example, there are as many as sixty items on the agenda, and the most important issues are all pending issues that have been discussed for three years without resolution. For example, (1) the issue of international control of atomic energy; (2) the issue of the Greek civil war; (3) the issue of Korean unification; (4) the issue of the existence or abolition of the veto power. Whether these pending issues can be resolved is truly a question. In addition, the different ideologies and conflicting interests of the East and West are intensifying the Cold War, and opinions on these pending issues are even more divergent, no less than going in opposite directions. How can there be hope of reaching an agreement?

Therefore, as we look forward to the future of this General Assembly, thorns and difficulties are everywhere. The pending issues that have already been placed on the agenda are enough to bring down the United Nations, let alone other pressing events? The Palestine issue aside, the Berlin incident alone is enough to cause this General Assembly to end on an unhappy note. The life of the United Nations is fragile and must not encounter the blows of storms and rain again. On the day of the opening of the Third Session of the United Nations General Assembly, we sincerely offer a word to the political diplomats of all countries. This General Assembly is the last critical juncture for the success or failure of the United Nations. Everyone must seize the opportunity, gather everyone's wisdom, and forge a smooth path for the United Nations. President Truman has already announced October 24 as United Nations Day and declared his sincere support for the United Nations. We only hope that the great powers can all treat each other with sincerity, eliminate suspicion, abandon interests, and jointly seek the rebirth of the United Nations on the condition that the interests of the United Nations are above all else. In this way, not only can humanity's confidence in the United Nations be prevented from wavering, but world peace can also reveal a glimmer of hope. The current international situation is serious. Whether the opening of this General Assembly can be a turning point to reverse the adverse current depends on whether the political diplomats of the great powers have great wisdom and courage.

### Part of Japanese Plundered Property Approved for Return Yesterday by Allied Headquarters; We Request Return of Another Batch of Goods

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, Dispatch of the 20th] Wu Banchen, head of our delegation to Japan for reparations and restitution, told this agency's reporter today that Allied Headquarters has approved the return of plundered property worth US$419,000 to China. Wu also stated that our Restitution Advisory Committee had also submitted a proposal to the Chief of Staff of Allied Headquarters requesting the return of another batch of goods worth US$371,500 to our country. The main items of property approved for return are 818 items such as lathes, screw-making machines, and electric motorcycles, as well as other types of machines worth another US$409,760. This batch of machines was seized from the Northwest Industrial Company run by Chairman Yan of Shanxi during the war. The main items of property proposed for return include 106 items such as lathes, screw-making machines, grinders, drilling machines, and electric motorcycles, as well as many other types of machines worth approximately US$280,410. This batch of machines was seized from the South China Iron Works hosted by former Minister of Communications Zeng Yangfu in Hong Kong. In addition to machines, the property approved for return today also includes 1,000 kilograms of cotton yarn worth US$600, 7,326 kilograms of zinc worth US$1,900, and 40,470 yards of cloth worth US$6,876. Other items of property proposed for return include approximately 4,659 kilograms of lead worth US$2,000, 7,125 kilograms of tin worth US$16,145, 2,011 kilograms of antimony worth US$1,637, and 2,828 kilograms of copper ingots worth US$1,389. In addition, there are three Wright Cyclone aircraft engines and a box of parts, worth approximately US$70,000. Wu said that our naval aviation station in Shanghai requested the return of six of these engines last winter, but only three have been found in Japan. In addition to requesting the return of property, our Restitution Advisory Committee has also submitted a proposal to hand over 96,000 Japanese yen from the "Allied Headquarters Custody Account," because Allied Headquarters has sold 38,876 kilograms of Chinese bristles plundered by the Japanese army. Wu said that Allied Headquarters sold this batch of bristles to the Japanese as fertilizer because it was rapidly decaying.

(2) Fairness. (3) Starting with oneself, such as restrictions on the use of stationery, cars, water, and electricity by government agencies. The measures for saving gasoline and reducing cars submitted to the Executive Yuan for deliberation were also revised and passed, and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation (the contents of the measures can be found on page 2 of this newspaper on the 17th).

### Shaanxi Cotton Gradually Enters the Market

Transactions are Slow Due to Frozen Prices

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, 20th] This year's Shaanxi cotton has gradually entered the market. The quality and color are excellent, but the yield per unit is worse than in previous years. However, due to the increased cotton field area, the total output is still over one million dan. Since the price freeze, transactions have been slow. Cotton farmers, considering costs, are unwilling to sell in large quantities, only exchanging small amounts of cotton for wheat, at a rate of six dou of wheat for every ten jin of cotton. Yesterday and today, the rate has weakened, with only four shi and eight sheng of wheat obtainable. Various counties hope the authorities will revise the cotton price to make it reasonable. China Textile and other yarn mills have not been able to purchase in large quantities due to price concerns and are currently taking a wait-and-see approach.

[Special Dispatch from Beijing, 20th] To cooperate with the President's call to launch the National Construction Movement of Diligence and Thrift, the Ministry of Food has decided to start by increasing food production and promoting food conservation.

In the future, the final grinding process will be eliminated, and there will be no more special grade flour or special rice. All will be based on a moderate quality, and the value will be estimated based on the lowest grade, so that the nutrition of citizens will be beneficial, the burden will be reduced, and manufacturers will be able to increase production and sales, with profits remaining as before.

### Nanjing College and University Students' Association: An Open Letter to Chiang Ching-kuo, Offering Three Points of Advice Frankly

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] The Nanjing College and University Students' Association believes that the government's recent promulgation of the emergency financial and economic plan and the assignment of Chiang Ching-kuo to Shanghai to supervise its implementation shows that for the past month, Mr. Chiang has been fighting against evil forces with a spirit of great fearlessness to control the market and investigate illegal merchants, without complaint or sacrifice, which is admirable. To support this measure, in addition to organizing a support association to promote it, the association has specially written an "Open Letter to Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo" to express its respect. The full text is as follows:

Mr. Ching-kuo:

Long ago, your revolutionary spirit left a deep impression on the hearts of us young people. This is by no means a false compliment, but rather the unanimous support gained by young people across the country in your usual care for the lives of the people, concern for the future of the country, and enthusiastic attitude towards the facts of youth. In this turbulent era, how many bureaucrats and politicians are fooling the people with their power, acting like bullies, how many wealthy merchants are exploiting the people and making a fortune during inflation, and how many young men and women are indulging in a life of luxury. Conversely, there is everywhere full of famine, death, and terror. In such contradictory and unfair circumstances, only you grow more courageous as the environment becomes more dangerous; the more the people suffer, the closer you get to the people; the more frustrated the youth, the more you sympathize with the youth; you are the lighthouse of our youth, you illuminate the dawn of China.

The government's recent promulgation of the emergency financial and economic plan and reform of the currency system is of great importance to the future of the country and the lives of the people. As the President has indicated: only success is allowed, failure is not allowed! In the short month since its implementation, thanks to the unanimous support of the people across the country, and Mr. Chiang's efforts with great momentum to stabilize Shanghai, the economic center of the country, the people across the country have gradually overcome this difficult time in peace. Truth tells us: whoever stands on the side of the people, the people will support. There is no power in the world greater than the power of the people. Since you stand on the side of the people and fight for the vital interests of the people, the people will certainly support you in completing this great, arduous, and epoch-making task. You are the servant of the people, you are the hero of the people.

However, the undeniable facts and those standing on the opposite side of the people are bureaucratic politicians, comprador merchants, profiteers, and wealthy merchants… these many reactionary forces are still lurking around the people, ready to seize the opportunity to devour the people and strangle the fate of the country. These bloodsuckers are not only the hidden reefs that are currently undermining currency reform, but also obstacles to the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood. At this critical moment, we would like to offer frank advice to Mr. Chiang and are willing to work with Mr. Chiang to promote progress.

(1) Eliminate evils thoroughly and enforce the law like a mountain: This currency reform is not only to stabilize the current economy, but also the first step in realizing the Principle of People's Livelihood. The more harm is eliminated today, the sooner the Principle of People's Livelihood will be realized. Therefore, we advocate a firm determination to eliminate evils thoroughly and enforce the law like a mountain to deal with profiteers and wealthy merchants, capture tigers, and swat flies. We also advocate using severe laws to judge these public enemies of the people.

(2) Liquidate the wealthy and save the poor: Before the government promulgated the emergency financial and economic plan, our enemies, the communists, were constantly publicizing that our government was implementing "people's death-ism." Overseas public opinion was also very unfavorable, thinking that our economy would soon collapse completely. Thinking back, our past economic system and the crisis of malignant inflation were indeed too terrible. The wealthy people who concentrated wealth spent money like water and enjoyed endless pleasures, while the exploited poor could not even get clothes to keep warm or food to fill their stomachs. How can such an unfair phenomenon not make people's hearts change and society be in chaos? Although this currency reform has strictly controlled the market, restricted prices, and stopped inflation, it has not requisitioned the wealth of those who have already benefited from exploiting the people in the past, nor the wealth of wealthy merchants. The lives of the poor have not improved. We firmly advocate liquidating the property of the wealthy to save the lives of the poor. As Mr. Chiang said, "Better to have one family cry than a whole road cry."

(3) Diligence and thrift are the only way to overcome difficulties: The wasteful psychology of the urban people caused by inflation must also be corrected today with currency reform. Otherwise, unlimited waste will definitely stimulate prices and cause a phenomenon of inflation where supply cannot meet demand. In particular, the enjoyment of high-ranking officials and dignitaries, regardless of the outflow of foreign exchange and the blood and sweat of the people, and willful waste, is really an unreasonable phenomenon. Therefore, we firmly advocate the thorough implementation of the rationing system, restricting the import of non-essential goods, so that useful things can be used in a concentrated manner, and the suppression of the rebellion can be completed as soon as possible, and we can embark on the road of national construction. We also hope to reform the economy and reform people's hearts at the same time, change social customs, break through the current difficulties, and make the new China grow strong under our efforts.

Nothing is difficult in the world, as long as there is determination. Mr. Chiang is our respected revolutionary mentor. Today, since you have made the greatest determination to shoulder the task of being a pioneer in economic reform, the hearts of thousands of young people in Nanjing pay tribute to you! We are also determined to use the unparalleled mass power of hundreds of thousands of college and university students in Nanjing as your backing. We are even more willing to follow Mr. Chiang forever on the long road of the Chinese revolution!

### The World's Attention Focused on Paris: UN General Assembly Opens Today; The Stalemate of the Berlin Problem Cannot Be Resolved; The Foreign Ministers of the Three Powers Discuss Countermeasures

[News Report] London, 20th: Broadcast from Paris: US Secretary of State Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin have both arrived in Paris to attend the opening ceremony of the UN General Assembly on the 21st. It is expected that after consultations between the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France, the Berlin crisis may be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. Both Bevin and Marshall have German issue follow-ups. General Clay, the US military governor of Berlin, will fly to Paris to report to Marshall.

[News Report] Paris, 20th: Broadcast: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky arrived here today to attend the UN General Assembly. It is said that the purpose of his visit is to consolidate peace, and he is not pessimistic about the future.

[News Report] Paris, 20th: Broadcast: Marshall is scheduled to hold a special meeting with the British and French Foreign Ministers today to decide to give up direct

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 20th] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie arrived at Le Bourget Airport in Paris by plane this morning from Brussels.

[United Press, Paris, 20th] US Secretary of State Marshall arrived in Paris today on a special "Independence" aircraft. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and McNair Clause also arrived by train minutes after Marshall's arrival. The Western Three Groups intend to take this opportunity to hold emergency consultations on the deadlock with the Soviet Union. Marshall and Bevin will consult with French Foreign Minister Schuman this afternoon on a joint plan of action on the Berlin issue. This may be an appeal to the United Nations, which will condemn the Soviet Union for violating the charter. According to a Moscow dispatch, the Kremlin talks have broken down, and US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and British Envoy Roberts have been summoned to Paris from Moscow via Berlin tomorrow. State Department Soviet expert Bohlen arrived here on the same plane as Marshall. British Ambassador Douglas also flew in from London. The three foreign ministers are expected to summon military commanders stationed in Germany to Paris to participate in the most important Western Three-Power Conference since the war. Bevin and Marshall looked tense and went to their respective embassies as soon as they got off the train. The two immediately consulted with the highest representatives and advisors and prepared to visit Schuman according to convention. It is believed that the three foreign ministers will determine the time and place of the first meeting. The summoning of the three countries' envoys to the Soviet Union and commanders in Germany to Paris is tantamount to erecting a monument to mourn the Kremlin talks. Every United Nations representative is invigorated, so that they can perform in this year's General Assembly "Battle of Berlin." The Soviet Union had expected this long ago, so it has formally declared that the Berlin crisis is not within the power of the United Nations.

[United Press, London, 20th] When asked about the Moscow talks, a British Foreign Office spokesman said, "I cannot confirm that the talks have broken down, and I cannot say what the second step is." The spokesman confirmed that British Envoy Roberts will fly to Paris on the 21st, but added: "This does not mean that the recall of Roberts has been finalized." Strang, the head of the German Department of the Foreign Office, has flown to Paris today.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 20th] Today, delegations from several countries arrived in Paris. The Polish delegation, led by Modlavsky, and the Yugoslav delegation, led by Kahar, arrived in Paris this morning. In addition, the Canadian delegation, led by Prime Minister King, arrived in Le Havre today and transferred to Paris by train.

### Chiang Ting-fu Broadcasts to the Country, Hoping That This Meeting Will Strengthen the Power of the United Nations and That Asian Countries Can Get More Opportunities to Participate in Activities

[Central News Agency, Paris, 20th] On the eve of the UN General Assembly, Chiang Ting-fu, our country's permanent representative to the United Nations, broadcast a speech from here, stating that the Chinese delegation's attendance at the Paris UN General Assembly has two important hopes: (1) that this meeting of the UN General Assembly can strengthen the power of the United Nations and make it the highest body for protecting the peaceful world; (2) that Asian and Far Eastern member states can get more opportunities to participate in UN activities.

Chiang said that the eyes of the world are currently focused on Paris. Tomorrow's conference will be held in the shadow of Bernadotte's tragic death. The current problems are numerous and complex international issues, such as the Palestine issue, the Korean issue, and the control of atomic energy. Chiang said, "I am not a pessimist. We must understand the importance of the various problems facing the United Nations. These problems can be solved, but only when all countries cooperate fully for common interests." Chiang said that although the United Nations is a significant improvement over the previous League of Nations, it still tends to lack attention to Asian and Far Eastern issues. Chiang cited examples, such as Asia currently having only one director in the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council. Finally, Chiang hopes to increase the opportunities for Asian countries to participate in the United Nations, so that more attention will be paid to the problems of the Asian people in the future.

### The UK's Attitude Towards Franco's Spain Remains Unchanged

[United Press, London, 20th] British Deputy Foreign Minister Mayhew told the Lower House today that the UK's attitude towards Spain remains unchanged. Conservative Party member Lindsay asked Mayhew, "Regardless of how unfavorable the Franco government was to the Allies during the war, is it not a fact that the Spanish government has always prevented the spread of communism?" Mayhew replied, "The Spanish government has been in cahoots with fascism for too long, and we have nothing in common with it. The Franco government is a weakness of Western democracy."

### Marshall Still Has High Hopes for the UN General Assembly

Delivered a short speech before leaving the country

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 19th] Before leaving for Paris, Marshall made a brief statement to the press, briefly describing the seriousness of the world situation, saying, "I cannot now state what position the US delegation will take on the various issues that the UN General Assembly and Security Council will discuss. We must wait quietly for these events to be presented one by one. In the next few weeks, the world's attention will be focused on Paris, and I sincerely hope that the discussions there can lead to a more peaceful world. But just having hope is not enough, and we must use our intelligence a lot. We will do our best to win an agreement that meets the general interests of the world, which is also in our interest."

### US Official Denies Saying US and Switzerland Have a Secret Agreement

[Central News Agency, London, 19th, United Press] Moscow Radio recently condemned Sweden for entering into a secret treaty with the United States for broad cooperation between the two countries when war looms or is threatened.

### Before the UN General Assembly Decides on the Korean Situation, the US Military Decides to Remain in South Korea; The US State Department Officially Notifies the Soviet Union

[News Report] New York, 20th, Emergency Broadcast: The United States notified the Soviet Union today that the US military has decided to remain in Korea until the United Nations General Assembly makes a decision on the entire Korean issue. This notice was officially issued by the State Department in response to the Soviet Union's statement of withdrawal. The US believes that the Soviet Union is responsible for the past failure of the US and the Soviet Union to agree on the withdrawal of troops.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th, United Press] Marshall said at a press conference here that the US does not intend to withdraw its troops from South Korea while the United Nations is considering the fate of the countries that have been at war in the Pacific. He also said that it is impossible to make any decision on the withdrawal of troops before the United Nations General Assembly meets in Paris. He did not comment on the report by Moscow Radio that the Soviet Union will withdraw its occupying forces from North Korea on New Year's Day next year and hopes that the United States will do the same in South Korea. However, according to well-informed officials, they believe that this announcement by Moscow is another propaganda action by the Soviet Union.

It was also pointed out that about a year ago, Moscow made the same announcement and set a deadline of January 1, 1948, for complete withdrawal, but the Red Army is still stationed in North Korea. Even if the Soviet army withdraws, the US army must wait until the various forces in Korea have been disarmed, except for those absolutely necessary to maintain peace and order, after the completion of the armed forces. He firmly believes that the US military will not stay

### Military Parade Held in Budapest

### The President of Hungary Arrives in Turkey; Turkey Asks Him to Issue a Statement

Willing to maintain good relations with neighboring countries

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 19th] Political circles here say that the arrival of several anti-communist leaders from Central Europe, such as Hungary's Naji, in Turkey has led many to suspect that some exiled political leaders will use Turkey as a springboard to resist their respective communist governments. However, the Turkish government's communique has clearly stated its determination to maintain good relations with Central and Eastern European countries. Political circles said, "Turkey does not want to become an outpost for various anti-communist parties to resist the governments of Eastern Europe."

### UN General Assembly to Handle Complex Issues, Diplomacy About to Unfold, Shadow Cast Over World Peace

[United Press Paris, 20th] Fifty-eight countries, large and small, from around the world will gather in one room on the 21st to attend the opening ceremony of the UN General Assembly. This conference will proceed under an atmosphere of increasingly worsening mutual recriminations between East and West. The backdrop of the conference is marred by the newly painted stains of murder and disturbance, contrary to its original purpose.

The assassination of Count Bernadotte, the UN mediator for the Palestine dispute, the activities of the Javanese Communists, coupled with the Berlin crisis, the deadlock on the Korean issue, the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, and the situation in the Balkans, will cause headaches for the world's diplomatic community.

The Palestine armistice and finding a permanent peace between Arabs and Jews is already a troublesome problem, but the new condemnations of Israel in the minds of the representatives make it even more complex. The coup by the Javanese Communists has heightened general concerns about rebellions and revolutions in Southeast Asia. After Moscow Radio announced on the evening of the 19th that Soviet troops would withdraw from North Korea starting in mid-October, the Korean issue took another turn.

The following are important issues already included in the General Assembly's agenda:

Atomic Energy: Western powers are demanding a halt to the Atomic Energy Commission's debate, as they have been in disagreement with the Soviet Union for two years. They are reporting to the General Assembly that this deadlock cannot be resolved by the nature of the committee, and this issue has been submitted to the General Assembly, overcoming Soviet opposition.

Disarmament: Due to the same reasons as above, facing Soviet opposition, negotiations have been fruitless. Western countries are asking the General Assembly to suspend discussions until the world situation improves.

Greece: The United States will use pressure to renew accusations against Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria for aiding Greek guerrillas. Western countries will request the continued existence of the UN Balkan Observation Commission and are expected to succeed.

New Member States: Austria, Finland, Italy, Portugal, and Transjordan have already gained the support of a majority of member states in the Security Council for admission to the UN, but the Soviet Union used its veto power to oppose them. Argentina has suggested abolishing the veto power of major powers on applications for membership, so the General Assembly may proceed independently to recognize the applications of the seven countries vetoed by the Soviet Union.

Korea: Due to Soviet opposition and other obstructions, the General Assembly last year sent a delegation to Korea to monitor elections and independence. It is expected that this delegation will submit a report to the General Assembly on the successful elections in the US-occupied zone, and the United States will also request the General Assembly to propose further steps.

Little Assembly: The Little Assembly, which the Soviet Union opposes, has been recommended for a one-year extension. It is a foregone conclusion that the Soviet Union will oppose it again. It is generally expected that the Little Assembly will continue to exist to complete tasks such as dealing with the veto power.

Spain: Poland has proposed that the United Nations take action to remove Franco from the Spanish political arena, but the General Assembly has allowed Franco to remain in power. As long as Franco is in power, Spain will not be allowed to join the United Nations, but there will be no stronger measures taken.

### A Glimpse of the Current Situation in Yugoslavia

— Translated by the Newsroom of this Newspaper

Several weeks before the Communist Information Bureau issued a statement condemning the Yugoslav Communist Party, two individuals, a photographer named Standel and a correspondent named Weiland from "Life Magazine," traveled through Yugoslavia for three weeks. Their footsteps covered the states of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Based on what they saw during their journey, they firmly believe that Tito is still a hero in the eyes of most Yugoslavs. Apart from land, he has nationalized almost everything. Moreover, regardless of whether it is a "new democracy" or not, Yugoslavia under Tito's rule remains a police state.

In addition, they discovered that Yugoslavia is a country with very beautiful scenery, where farmers make up 80% of the total population, and they all have a small piece of land that belongs to them. In order to gain the support of the farmers first, Tito delayed the "collectivization of agriculture" plan and supplied the countryside with a large number of seeders and tractors, intending to entice the farmers to place their resources under the government's control. This slow approach to "nationalizing agriculture" has drawn fierce criticism from the Communist Information Bureau.

Although Tito's development in promoting the nationalization of agriculture has been relatively slow, the speed of his nationalization plans in cities and industries is exactly what any Stalinist could hope for. Railways and large department stores have already been nationalized, and even very small retail stores, in Belgrade alone, have had 1,150 of them nationalized.

Post-war reconstruction work and labor resources are all either owned or controlled by the government. The government summons volunteers to build roads, and at the same time, orders a large number of doctors and lawyers to leave the cities and go to the countryside, where there is a greater need.

In order to raise the standards of the industrialization five-year plan, Tito does not hesitate to lower the people's living standards in order to raise funds to purchase the machinery he needs from the West. However, although the machinery discussed comes from the West, at least 16.3 million books by Marx and Lenin, as well as tens of millions of words denouncing "Western imperialism," were printed by some of the printing machines last year alone.

During their journey, Standel and Weiland also saw thousands of photos of Tito, larger than even statues of Stalin.

In May of this year, Tito held a large-scale international exhibition in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, which was visited by as many as 300,000 people. Although Tito himself did not attend, several government officials visited the exhibition. In this exhibition, there were several things that fully demonstrated Tito's desire to trade with Western countries. Apart from the people of Yugoslavia, every foreigner would find this a wonderful exhibition. All the beds in the hotels were reserved for foreign merchants, and all the bright and new Yugoslav goods were marked "For Export Only."

The purpose of the exhibition was obviously to promote commerce with Western countries. Yugoslavia urgently needs Western machinery, and they are even prepared to use basic raw materials and Yugoslav specialties as a means of exchange. At the same time, in order to easily attract Westerners to Yugoslavia, Tito does not hesitate to lift a corner of the Iron Curtain. Obtaining passports has suddenly become easier, and the food rationing system for tourists has been abolished. "Sightseeing tours" are not only permitted but also greatly encouraged and welcomed. This has attracted 2,000 entrepreneurs, most of whom come from the West. Subsequently, trade between Yugoslavia and Switzerland, Sweden, Italy, France, Belgium, and other countries is as prosperous and active as that between Yugoslavia and Austria.

### Plan to Organize International Guard Force Included in UN General Assembly Agenda for Deployment by UN to Undertake Peacekeeping Missions

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 20th, broadcast from Paris: UN Secretary-General Lie will

According to information from UN Headquarters, Lie has contacted delegations from several countries, and they have generally expressed their agreement.

### Indonesian Republic Splits Apart, Communist Party Captures Madiun City and Forms Separate Government, President Sukarno Resolves to Quell Rebellion

[United Press Batavia, 20th] The newly established Indonesian Republic cancelled its constitutional guarantees on the 20th and granted President Sukarno emergency dictatorial powers to quell the Communist Party, which has occupied the important city of Madiun. The Standing Committee of the Indonesian Parliament held an emergency meeting and acknowledged that Indonesia "is facing a crisis situation," as the Communist Party Chairman Muso, who returned from Moscow several months ago, has led a rebellion. Reports from Yogyakarta stated that Muso has been appointed as the President of the Javanese Soviet Republic, and former Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir has also joined the rebel party as Prime Minister. After the Yogyakarta radio station reported the Madiun rebellion on the morning of the 19th, it announced that Yogyakarta had begun a large-scale search and arrest of Communists and leftists, and more than 200 people had been detained within the first 24 hours. Soldiers were stationed in the streets, and police patrolled in front of the Shabuk She office of the Communist-controlled union. Under the emergency dictatorial bill, Sukarno has the power to take "actions outside of legal and effective procedures to safeguard national security" for the next three months. The bill was passed by the Standing Committee by a vote of 25 to 1. Prime Minister Hatta attended and spoke, guaranteeing that swift action would be taken to quell the war aimed at overthrowing the government. The Yogyakarta radio station also stated that all leftist newspapers and magazines have been closed down, and the Indonesian Islamic Party, the largest party in Indonesia, has joined the Nationalist Party to form the anti-communist "National Independence Front." The Madiun radio station, under Communist control, simultaneously condemned the Indonesian authorities for handing the country over to the Dutch and referred to the republic as a "fascist state." It also accused Sukarno and Hatta of colluding with Japan during the war and finally announced that the Communist Party's goal was to conquer all of Indonesia, saying that "the time for revolution has begun." A delayed report from Antara news agency acknowledged that the capture of Madiun, as claimed by the Communist Party, was extremely swift and almost bloodless. Antara stated that only two officers were killed and four were injured. It also stated that cars with hammer and sickle flags were traveling throughout the city, and the Communist Party flag was raised on the city hall. Former Indonesian Prime Minister and UN representative Sjahrir declared in Batavia: "Civil war seems to be brewing within the Republic, and it is difficult to say how the situation will develop." A Dutch official military spokesperson told the United Press that "We should face the situation squarely, but at present, we will definitely not intervene. If Communist forces continue to spread, we will have no choice but to take action."

[Agence France-Presse, Yogyakarta, 19th] The Republic's public gazette stated that Madiun, a city north of Yogyakarta in central Java, was occupied last night by the Communist Party with the support of some regular Republic troops.

[Agence France-Presse, Yogyakarta, 19th] The Indonesian Republican government has appointed General Sun-Konno as the commander-in-chief for the suppression of Communists within the territory of the Republic of Java.

### First Public Trial of Rong Hongyuan Case, Admits to Exchange Arbitrage, Claims Not Attempting to Profit, Tang Yao'an Found to Have Committed Other Crimes, Prosecuted and Will Be Summoned for Questioning

[Report from this Newspaper] Rong Hongyuan, General Manager of Shen Hsin Textile Company, was prosecuted by the Special Criminal Tribunal for the private foreign exchange arbitrage case. The first public trial was held at the Special Criminal Tribunal at 9:30 am yesterday.

The focus of yesterday's trial was the detailed circumstances of the exchange arbitrage of HK$189,650, equivalent to 41 billion legal tender. According to Rong's testimony: "This matter was decided solely by Chen Yuanzhi, Shen Hsin's representative in Hong Kong. I did not approve of this in the first place, but Chen had already negotiated it, so I had to hand over the 41 billion legal tender to seven collectors including Tang Yao'an in Shanghai. I don't remember where 3 billion of it was delivered, but it can be found by checking the accounts. In short, this exchange arbitrage was for the purpose of purchasing Indian cotton for production. It was an unavoidable measure to maintain commercial credit and was not intended to profit. As for Chen Yuanzhi, Pan Yaowen, an employee of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, and Mu Jinzhang, they are probably all in Hong Kong now. Please summon them directly. I cannot be responsible for their actions." The trial ended around 11 am, and Rong Hongyuan was returned to the detention center.

In addition, the examining magistrate discovered from the confession of Tang Yao'an in the case that he is also known as Tang Yunzhong and had previously been prosecuted for disrupting the financial market. He will be summoned for questioning on the 24th in a separate case. Gong Chongrui, Lin Siping, Liang Qianli, Li Shiying, Zhou Defa, Guanghua Company, and others are also deeply involved in the case and will be summoned for questioning separately at a later date.

The electricity supply in Nanshi has been frequently interrupted in recent months, causing great pain to residents. After the City Council resolved to send a letter to the public utility authorities to find ways to improve the situation, the City Government has now responded. According to the response, the main reason for the poor electricity supply in Nanshi is that the power generation equipment of the China Merchant Electric Company, which is responsible for supplying electricity to the area, was dismantled and moved to Shijingshan by the enemy and puppet regime during the occupation and is still being held by the Resources Commission and has not been returned. Currently, the electricity used in the area is purchased from the Shanghai Electric Power Company, so when the equipment of that company malfunctions and reduces power generation, the electricity supply in Nanshi is affected. After the Bureau of Public Utilities convened a meeting of various companies to discuss improvement measures, in addition to increasing the supply from Shanghai Electric Power Company by 2,000 kilowatts in order to alleviate the power shortage in Nanshi, it is also continuing to negotiate with the Resources Commission to expedite the return of the generators of China Merchant Electric Company that were looted by the enemy. At the same time, it is urging the company to speed up the installation of the new 4,000-kilowatt generators purchased from the Executive Yuan in order to actively increase the power supply. It is understood that the above-mentioned new 4,000-kilowatt unit can be installed by the end of the year, and the electricity supply situation in Nanshi will be greatly improved at that time.

### Pork Demand Exceeds Supply, Three Associations Guarantee Supply of 2,000 Pigs Per Day

[Report from this Newspaper] The market situation has shown a phenomenon of demand exceeding supply for several days, especially for fish and meat. According to analysis by relevant parties, the reasons are: (1) the demand is too high during the Mid-Autumn Festival, (2) the recent wind and rain affected the source of supply, and (3) vendors are evading price controls. The police bureau also summoned the chairmen of the Fresh Pork Association, Fresh Meat Association, and Pig Trade Association, Xin Xiaokang, Hong Wenjiang, and Zhu Zhigao, to the bureau for questioning. According to them, the supply of fresh pigs has been insufficient recently, resulting in the market not being able to meet the demand. Starting today, about 2,000 fresh pigs can be supplied to the city every day. The police bureau, considering that this matter is related to the daily necessities of 5 million citizens in the city, specifically ordered the persons in charge of each association to guarantee that the above situation would not happen again.

At 10:00 am today, the Bureau of Social Affairs will invite the police bureau, the Bureau of Public Health, and the Bureau of Finance to convene a meeting with the persons in charge of the fresh meat, pig trade, and other industries to discuss the issue of suppressing the black market for pork and unblocking sources of supply.

### Jiang Jingguo and Zhang Shi Inspect Small Vegetable Market

[Report from this Newspaper] Supervisor Jiang Jingguo, accompanied by Deputy Director of the City Police Bureau Zhang Shi, and Chief Secretary Chen Hanping of the Supervisor's Office, personally inspected the Fuzhou Road small vegetable market and cloth market yesterday morning. According to informed sources: the authorities paid close attention to the disappearance of chicken, duck, and fresh meat from the vegetable market yesterday, believing that price controls had been in place for some time and that this incident only happened suddenly yesterday, indicating that someone was manipulating it behind the scenes. Jiang Jingguo and Yu Shuping discussed this yesterday and decided that the police bureau would concentrate all its efforts to resolve the issue within a day or two. The supply of fish and meat in this city should not be a problem. Taking fish as an example, if the Fisheries Administration Bureau sells directly, the supply to the market will be more than sufficient. At the same time, because it can avoid the layers of exploitation by middlemen, the price may be about 50% lower.

### Relief Special Donation Exceeds Original Quota, Decision Made to Widely Solicit Donations

It is understood that the committee's original fundraising target of 850 billion legal tender, after being converted to gold yuan coupons, is still less than 3 million yuan. It has been decided to widely solicit donations to ensure that the original quota is exceeded.

### Self-Proclaimed Inventor of Fire Prevention Equipment

[Report from our newspaper] Mayor Wu recently received an extremely long and strange letter, signed by He Weisen, residing at No. 7, Lane 406, Shanhai Pass Road. The letter stated that since the several major fires at the Yongbei Underwear Factory in Zhabei and in the city, he had invented a fire prevention device with effectiveness surpassing a parachute, and that he could demonstrate it publicly if doubted. However, the letter did not describe the construction of the fire prevention device. Mayor Wu forwarded the letter to the Fire Department of the Police Bureau. The Fire Department summoned He for a test yesterday. He explained that his fire prevention device was very simple: a white cloth is hung down from the third floor. In case of fire, one can climb down the white cloth, avoiding being burned to death, which is better than a parachute, thus escaping danger and death. He hoped that those rescued would give gifts in gratitude for his invention. The Fire Department, seeing that he was of short stature and seemed mentally ill, and that his method was a joke, sent He to the First Division of the Police Department to investigate the reason.

The near strike makes me laugh.

### Strengthening Production, Discussing Raw Material Supply and Demand: Jiang Jingguo Separately Invites Industry and Business Leaders for Talks

[Report from our newspaper] In order to study the supply and demand of industrial raw materials and strengthen the production of materials, Jiang Jingguo, the Shanghai District Economic Supervisor, through Wu Kaixian, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, has invited dozens of representatives from important industrial and commercial sectors and labor representatives in the city to hold regular discussions, aiming to achieve effective economic control and promote the rational development of industry and commerce. The invitation notices have already been sent. Those invited on September 21st include Xu Xueyu, Wang Xiaolai, Ge Jiecun, Jin Runxiang, Tu Kaizheng, Hong Fumei, Wang Yuqing, Wu Pengnian, Xiao Zongjun, Zhang Yiqu and others, representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.

### Government Willing to Help Factories Procure Raw Materials

[Another dispatch] According to a spokesperson from the Economic Control and Supervision Office, the government is clearly assisting factories in procuring raw materials, reducing transportation difficulties for manufacturers. For example, it is not easy for factories to obtain railway cars for transport between Xuzhou and Pukou on their own. Currently, rapeseed, the raw material for cooking oil, is being procured jointly by government and businesses. However, it is feared that it will be difficult to revise the price limits on finished products, as the controlling authorities believe that factories can only plan production if the currency value is stable. Otherwise, manufacturers will hoard raw materials and be unwilling to manufacture, as in the past, and nothing can be discussed. The government is willing to help industrialists solve their difficulties under the principle that price limits will not be changed. For example, the price of white paper has increased by 30 percent, but newspaper companies have not increased the price of newspapers and are still able to maintain operations.

### After Inspecting the United Logistics Warehouses, Deng Weiren Returns to Nanjing to Report to Deng

It is rumored that personnel will continue to be dispatched secretly for inspection in the future in order to achieve complete success.

### New Fujian Chairman Li Liangrong Welcomed by Fellow Provincials in Shanghai, Explains Principles of Governing Fujian: Removing Evil and Filth, Eliminating Barriers

The atmosphere was warm and enthusiastic. Chen Cheng, a representative of the fellow provincial associations, first delivered a welcome speech, followed by Chairman Li's address.

Exhausting Knowledge and Ability, Striving to the Utmost

Li rose amidst enthusiastic applause to deliver his speech, saying: "I am very moved by the welcome meeting organized by all of you fellow provincials. I think everyone is not only welcoming me personally, but welcoming a Fujianese returning to be the provincial chairman and manage the province's politics. This is a heavy burden related to the happiness of the people of the entire province. I hope that everyone can share this burden and provide guidance and assistance at any time. I think there are two important things in Fujian Province at present: one is to eliminate evil and corruption, which I will do earnestly, and the other is that Fujianese should unite, regardless of whether they are from the east, south, west, or north, and eliminate barriers, and work together to build a new Fujian. Regarding the improvement and renewal of various departments such as people's livelihood, finance, education, construction, military service, public security, and land taxation, I will do my best with my conscience and ability. As for detailed reform measures, they must await my return to Fujian to carefully examine the key issues before I can make decisions quickly."

The Future of Fujian Province Is Very Bright

Legislative Yuan member Qiu Hanping then delivered a speech, saying: "Local autonomy is an important part of democratic politics. We hope for autonomy, and after fifteen years of efforts by our fellow provincials, we have finally obtained the return of Fujianese to govern their own province. This good result is worthy of cherishing. Chairman Li's strict military administration is well-known. His spirit of loyalty to the party, love for the country, and hard work is admirable. His treatment of people can be represented by the four words 'honest, just, and impartial.' Therefore, Mr. Li can be said to be a model soldier and also a model provincial chairman. The future of Fujian Province is very bright. At the same time, we must not be divided by regions, be selfless, and work together to help Chairman Li build our ideal new Fujian." Subsequently, Yang Chuo'an, Ou Yuanhuai, Zeng Jigu, from the Hui'an Fellow Provincial Association, Lin Qingshan, from the Yongchun Fellow Provincial Association, and Ye Baoqi, from the San Shan Guild Hall, delivered speeches one after another, expressing their welcome to Li's appointment and hoping that Li would use new strength and new measures to seek benefits for the people of his hometown.

### Saint George's Manager Extorted, Case Confusing, Three Police Officers Accused, Trial to Begin, Who is the Mastermind Will Be Revealed

[Report from our newspaper] The case of Shao Guanrong, Shao Liang, and Zhu Bingxi, three detectives from the Detective Section of the Municipal Police Bureau, being accused of bribery will be tried by the District Court on the afternoon of the 24th of this month. A news item was published in a certain newspaper the other day, stating: Feng Qishan, the chief of the Robbery Case Unit of the Detective Section of the Criminal Division of the Municipal Police Bureau, and staff member Feng Xiushan, claimed to Wu Gensheng, the manager of the Saint George's Garden on Donghu Road in this city, that Wu was suspected of privately selling heroin, and that if he could pay 3 billion yuan, the case could be dropped, otherwise he would be arrested and severely punished. Wu, upon hearing this, was extremely worried, and Zhu Bingxi contacted him, paying 1.5 billion yuan in legal tender first. Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret and was discovered by the Police Bureau's Supervision Team. During the second payment of the remaining 1.5 billion yuan, Team Leader Pan of the team dispatched an inspector to arrest Zhu along with officers. After interrogation, the truth was confirmed, and all relevant criminals were arrested overnight. Director Yu of the Police Bureau, in order to rectify discipline and eliminate corruption, immediately detained Feng Qishan, but Feng Xiushan fled in fear of punishment and has not yet been brought to justice. It is now heard that Feng Qishan has been temporarily released on bail by Sun Kuifang, the head of the Criminal Division, and Li Junhou, the head of the Detective Section, with the condition that he must track down and arrest Feng Xiushan within three days. It is also said that the police officers involved in the case, Shao Guanrong, Shao Liang, and Zhu Bingxi, were handed over to the District Court for trial on charges of corruption by the Municipal Police Bureau on the 14th of this month. After seeing the report, the Municipal Police Bureau sent a letter to a certain newspaper that published the news on the 19th, correcting that Feng Qishan was not involved in the case and is still working in the bureau as usual. This correction letter led Wu Gensheng, the manager of Saint George's Garden, who was the victim, to publish large advertisements in various newspapers for several days, refuting the Police Bureau's correction letter as inconsistent with the facts, calling on all sectors to uphold justice, and detailing the facts. As of now, the mastermind behind this extortion and corruption case remains confusing and intriguing, but after the District Court opens the trial on the 24th, its relationship can be determined.

Xu Jiying Shows Opinion, First Eliminate Bad Habits

Xu Jiying, Director of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Chairman of the Municipal Council, spoke to a Central News Agency reporter yesterday in response to President Jiang's movement to build the country through diligence and thrift, saying: "Diligence and thrift are virtues that have been passed down in our country for thousands of years. The meaning of these two words is already known to everyone. The sayings 'Diligence can make up for clumsiness, and thrift can cultivate integrity' are especially good words. In President Jiang's broadcast, he elaborated on them in detail. If the ten covenants he instructed can be effectively implemented by everyone from top to bottom, the magnificent effect is self-evident. However, I personally feel that although the people of our country are familiar with this movement, its relationship with the country, society, and even individuals is deep and important, but bad habits are too deep. People only know how to talk about it but cannot take action, so that even today, the national leader must advocate and the social masses must promote it. To advocate and promote effectively, we must first eliminate bad habits and make people aware of the importance of this movement to the current environment."

Active Production, Passive Conservation

"The war of resistance against Japan has ended, but the internal turmoil launched by the Communist army is still intensifying. Various undertakings waiting for construction are therefore hindered, and the national economy has not improved. If we remain the same and do not improve, the future crisis is unimaginable. Therefore, today, it is urgent to build the country through diligence and thrift. Especially since the government is determined to rectify the economy and issued an emergency decree, it can be said that it has eliminated a vicious cycle and opened up a new path for us to work hard to renew ourselves. The people of the country should catch up quickly and reverse the declining trend, so that the government's efforts will be supported and the country's future will be guaranteed. As for how to combine the movement to build the country through diligence and thrift with actual life, President Jiang's ten covenants have very comprehensive and practical indicators. As far as our industrial and commercial circles are concerned, diligence means actively working hard to produce, and thrift means passively saving consumption. As long as we do everything practically and persevere without slackening, I believe that our country will definitely become rich and strong because of this, and we ourselves will also receive supreme benefits."

Wu Yun Comments

Wu Yun, Chairman of the National Industrial Association, expressed extreme support for the movement to build the country through diligence and thrift and expressed his views yesterday, saying: "The poverty of officials and the treachery of merchants, all kinds of evils, are caused by the omnipotence of money. With money, one can achieve what one wants. Everyone is greedy, and everyone loves money, so they do not hesitate to use deceitful and stealing means to obtain money. Therefore, to reverse the declining national customs and establish national morality, we must reduce the use of money, that is, we must eliminate the bad habit of luxury. The movement to build the country through diligence and thrift is indeed a specific and correct medicine for the times."

Promote Good People, Expose Bad People, Jing Panshi Expresses Views

Dr. Jing Panshi, Chairman of the Far East Council of the World Christian Leadership Association, recently expressed his views on the movement to build the country through diligence and thrift, saying: "The movement to build the country through diligence and thrift is aimed at all those who are not diligent or thrifty. Those who are arrogant, extravagant, dissolute, and do not move or pick up may only account for a small number in society, but the foundation of the country and nation is being eroded and rotted by a small number of people. The majority of diligent people cannot be ignored. I believe that to make the movement to build the country through diligence and thrift effective, we should first do two things: 'Promote good people' and 'Expose bad people.' Those who are diligent and thrifty should be rewarded with honors, and those who are extravagant and lazy should not only be condemned morally but also punished legally."

### Jiangsu-Zhejiang Supervisory Office Convenes a Forum With People From All Walks of Life to Increase Factory Production, Facilitate the Circulation of Materials, and Execute Economic Management Without Exceeding the Scope of Laws and Regulations

The forum ended at around 7:00 PM.

### Underground Springs Drawn from Sandy Wastes

— Our Reporter Song Binglin

[Our Newspaper Lanzhou Seventeenth Dispatch] Gansu is high in altitude and dry in climate, with frequent droughts. Especially in the Hexi region, agriculture relies entirely on the snowmelt from the Qilian Mountains for irrigation. Speaking of water conservancy in Hexi, good systems existed as far back as the Han Dynasty. Later, the center of politics, economy, and culture gradually shifted eastward. Due to its strategically important location, Hexi became a battleground for military strategists, leading to natural disasters and man-made calamities. The people suffered greatly, and water conservancy naturally declined.

Developing Water Conservancy in Hexi

Since the success of the Northern Expedition in the Republic of China, the central government has paid considerable attention to water conservancy in Gansu Province. During the war (year 31 of the Republic), the President inspected the Northwest and showed particular concern for the development of water conservancy in Hexi. He ordered former Chairman Gu Zhenglun to draft a "Ten-Year Implementation Plan for Gansu to Develop Water Conservancy in Hexi," entrusting the Gansu Water Conservancy and Forestry Company to manage it. Furthermore, the "Resolution to Expedite the Completion of Permanent Benefits in Hexi" was passed at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee in the 33rd year of the Republic, leading to the birth of the "Twelve-Year Plan for Gansu's Hexi Water Conservancy." Last year, the Gansu Water Conservancy Bureau was established, and a new water conservancy work plan was drawn up. Despite changes in personnel and plans over the past seven years, the goal has remained consistent: "To expand the irrigated area, increase food production, maintain the existing population, and attract immigrants from elsewhere." Currently, besides the Gansu Water Conservancy Bureau, the central government has the Hexi Water Conservancy Engineering Corps (with six detachments) and the Gansu Hydrological General Station, among other units, engaged in water conservancy work in Hexi.

Developing water conservancy in Hexi involves repairing old canals, opening new ones, and building reservoirs to retain water. However, there is a prerequisite: after the water flows out of the Qilian Mountain pass, it seeps into the desert within a hundred li. This terrain, covering 20 million mu, has abundant underground water reserves, rendering the costly canals and reservoirs ineffective. Therefore, after inspecting Hexi last year, the current Director of the Gansu Water Conservancy Bureau, Huang Wanli, decided on six strategies for Hexi's water conservancy. The most important of these was how to draw the underground water to the surface for irrigation.

Underground Aqueduct Method

This method is not yet widespread. There are only a dozen or so documented underground water projects worldwide. The entire water supply of Mönchengladbach in Germany relies on underground water using this method. There are no precedents in the Americas, and in the Far East, only one place in Taiwan during the Japanese occupation used this method. This method requires two conditions: a high underground water table and steep terrain. According to Huang Wanli, the Hexi region of Gansu is the only vast area in the world with the most suitable topography for this method.

Based on this belief, Director Huang believed that in order for the people to understand this "way to create resources," a model must first be created. Therefore, last year, Shandan and Jiuquan were selected to conduct experiments using two different methods. Huang traveled extensively, exhausting himself, and finally obtained two excavators from the Relief Administration. He trained fifty engineers (ten of whom were students from the China Vocational School) and requested funding from the central government and the US Aid Council. Notably, this was the first time the US Aid Council had allocated funds to the Northwest.

Construction Began in June

With all preparations in place, construction began successively in May and June of this year. Work was suspended for a month and a half around August due to the busy farming season, and has recently resumed. Work in Shandan lasted for two months. According to the government report, a total of 23.1 billion legal currency was spent, providing relief to many disaster victims in Yongchang and Minle. The original plan was to dig a water interception ditch four zhang deep to irrigate 20,000 mu of land. However, hard soil layers were encountered at a depth of more than one zhang, so the original plan was reduced by half, and the project cost was also reduced from the equivalent of 24,000 shi of wheat to 2,500 shi. Comparing the project cost and efficiency, the economic value has indeed increased. The project is now 60% complete, and water will be supplied to the fields in October. The government is planning to establish cooperative farms to distribute land to poor farmers for cultivation. Next spring, clear streams will flow through the sandy wastes. The project in Bianwan, Jiuquan, is 20% complete, and water has also been extracted. The original plan was to irrigate 60,000 mu of land. According to government announcements, 42 billion legal currency has been spent. Whether water can be used next spring will depend on funding and manpower, requiring redoubled efforts.

Spring Water Flows Gurgling

When water gurgles out of the ground in the vast sandy wastes, the local farmers stare with astonished eyes, wondering if they are dreaming (indeed, when this reporter first saw this scene, I was so excited that I almost shed tears). They say that the water conservancy engineering team must have a magic mirror that can see through the ground, otherwise, how would they know where there is water, and it would come out as soon as they dug? Director Huang said to the reporter with a smile: "This is based on academic theories including soil science, geology, and hydraulic engineering. Now the people of neighboring counties are requesting the development of underground water one after another. It has been decided to develop five places including Bulongji. We hope that after the demonstration projects in Shandan and Jiuquan serve as examples, the farmers will handle it themselves with our only technical guidance. This way, we can expand and popularize this new enterprise."

The advantage of this method is not only that it is simple and cheap (the project cost for irrigating each mu of land is only one shi of wheat, and each mu of land can produce more than two shi of wheat per year), but also that the money is mostly used for manual digging, which farmers can do themselves, and the project can be expanded or reduced depending on manpower and financial resources (Shandan is a good example), making it easy to see results.

Director Huang Wanli's Remarks

"The difficulty," Director Huang said, "is that the advanced technical theory cannot be mastered by ordinary engineers."

Huang continued: "To start a new enterprise, in addition to scientific theoretical basis, you also need a detailed plan, and then promote it with great courage and perseverance to succeed."

"This only piece of land in the world suitable for this type of underground water project, the land and people of Hexi can be proud! Revealing this path and using the results of this project experiment to elucidate new underground water theory, to contribute to the whole world, this is also something that the land and people of China can be proud of!..."

Director Huang Wanli is the eldest son of Mr. Huang Yanpei. He specialized in hydraulic engineering in the United States, so many of his subordinates are students from the China Vocational School who came to the Northwest to serve. Huang has a dignified appearance, resembling a banker. He believes that the Water Conservancy Bureau should not only be an administrative agency, but also a business organization. At the Gansu Provincial Assembly on July 22 this year, after he reported on the water conservancy administration, he said: "The purpose of water conservancy is to exchange a small amount of money for a large amount of production. The most important step in water conservancy is design, like the staff work of warfare. If the design is perfect, it can be successful." Therefore, people gave him a nickname: "Design Expert" (he also received the nickname "Model Expert" when he held the Lanzhou-Fengxiang Canal model exhibition last year.)

### Outpost in Central China, River Defense Base: Shashi

— Special Correspondent Ling Songshou

[Our Newspaper Shashi Sixteenth Dispatch] In mid-August, the Communists seized a gap and attacked the outskirts of Jingzhou and Shashi. In Shashi, which was not heavily garrisoned, it is conceivable that people felt uneasy. Fortunately, the Communist surprise attack was only like a breeze, lightly blowing over and lightly blowing away. The phoenix trees brought autumn wind to Shashi, and the external threat was temporarily resolved. However, the inner worries of the people of Shashi deepened with the arrival of the autumn wind.

In Shashi, there are only two or three shabby hotels, and not a single bathhouse. Not a single magnificent restaurant can be found on the most prosperous Zhongshan Road. For an inland commercial center like Shashi, the fact that there are so few places for consumption shows that the Shashi market is entirely built on the rural economy.

The hinterland of Shashi includes the entire central Hubei plain. Rice from Jiangbei and cotton from Jiangnan are the two lifelines of Shashi. Since Dabie Mountain became a Communist base in central Hubei and Li Renlin's troops infiltrated the area between the Yangtze and Han rivers, central Hubei in Jiangbei has long been filled with the smoke of war. This year, during the annual flood season, under the round-the-clock supervision of Commissioner Zhang Zhenguo, the Jingjiang Dam was fortunately spared any major trouble. Instead, the continuous rain from March to June damaged the autumn harvest. In Jiangling County alone, over 1.7 million mu of the 2.4 million mu of land were flooded. Generally speaking, the autumn harvest in central Hubei this year is likely to be only 60% of normal. In Shashi these days, the supply of rice cannot be strong due to transportation and production issues, and merchants from Yichang, Hankou, and Hunan continue to come to Shashi to purchase, so rice prices are rising daily. Therefore, don't be envious of the 15 yuan per dan of white rice, because the sensitive Shashi Chamber of Commerce had already discussed restricting rice exports a month ago; and the Shashi grain industry has also begun to worry about a potential grain shortage in Shashi!

Jiangnan is still a clean slate at the moment, but years of war and layers of exploitation and burden have devastated the already weak rural economy. Some people, for the sake of survival, have had to take risks and engage in robbery. "Ambush and concealment are rife, causing much concern." Officials are also worried about this fact. The few roads in Jiangnan that can be considered main lines are usually not heavily traveled, especially by merchants. Therefore, although this year's cotton production has not suffered from natural disasters, the joint assessment report from the National Textile Federation and the Cotton Production Improvement Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry estimates that "due to security concerns in Hubei, this year's production will sharply decline from 6,241,100 dan last year to 1,866,600 dan" (original text not recorded). Therefore, the production and sales situation when cotton enters the market at the end of the eighth lunar month is not something to be too optimistic about. During the week that the reporter stayed in Shashi, the market price of Shashi long-staple cotton jumped from over 60 yuan to 96.2 yuan. 96.2 yuan is still the price announced in the local newspaper, but in reality, it is likely to be higher. This fact is enough to make people think about how much business the cotton from southern Hubei can add to Shashi this year—although it is still a time of "shortage before the new crop." According to general estimates:

Of the rice produced in the plains of central Hubei, 40% is left for local consumption, and the remaining 60% is entirely exported to Shanghai and Hankou through Shashi. Cotton is almost entirely exported, with very limited local consumption. Before the war, during the "peak month" of the year—the eighth lunar month—rice and cotton bales piled up like mountains on the docks along the river. The big ships of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Dabei Steamship Company sometimes couldn't cope with their customers who shipped goods eastward, and almost every ship had to "cancel" several batches of goods. This year, the rice harvest is poor, making it difficult to ship excess rice, and the fate of cotton production is still unpredictable, so the docks naturally seem deserted. As the cool breeze rises and the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, according to the custom of ten years ago, the entrances of silver shops and fabric stores in Shashi should be decorated with lanterns and high arches to attract their "basic customers" from the countryside. But looking at the expressionless Zhongshan Road this year, the people of Shashi are inevitably filled with melancholy.

The business circle in Shashi today is too small. The Hanyi Highway was dissected, and the left and right arms of Shashi were cut off invisibly. The Yangtze River was originally the main artery of Shashi, but due to excessive military requisitioning, the grand scene of the government returning to Chongqing three years ago is repeated on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Ships of 3,000 to 4,000 tons above Hankou are as rare as the Queen Elizabeth. Passengers taking ships in Shashi, whether going upriver or downriver, usually have to wait for half a month. A berth on the ship, not even a room, costs over 150 million legal currency on the black market two weeks in advance. The main line to Xiangyang is maintained under the cloud of war on both sides. Although the purpose of keeping the road open is to focus on military transport, some supplies from northern Hubei can still use Shashi as a transit station to dilute the desolation of Shashi, as the Xianghan Highway (Xiangyang-Hankou) is not open. These days, on the highway in the northwest corner of Shashi, one can often see trucks loaded with cotton, transported from Xiangyang to Shashi. (This is still cotton from past stocks.) In fact, the poor transportation can only match the current inadequate Shashi market. If we could bring back the days of ten years ago, without any other factors, this pitiful transportation alone would be enough to suffocate Shashi!

Transportation problems are suffocating the Shashi market, and Shashi itself has even more

Intricate diseases hindering market development

During the Anti-Japanese War, Shashi could be said to be the enemy's front line in Central China (although Yichang was ahead). Therefore, the damage to Shashi from the war was not light. Countless tall buildings in Shashi were destroyed by bombs. Zhongshan Road, west of Chongwen Road, was completely reduced to ashes. To this day, there are only some thatched huts or dilapidated tile houses, shrinking their heads and standing by the roadside. Some of the larger buildings that survived still have machine gun bullet holes in their iron gates. This situation has created a congenital factor of housing shortage. However, the endless war in the area between the Yangtze and Han rivers has caused people from rural areas to concentrate in the city. Although in the midst of the uproar, there are not few people in Shashi who have fled to Hankou or Shanghai, but these people are too few to offset the refugees from the vast rural areas. Under the interlacing of congenital and acquired factors, Shashi began a housing shortage. According to the "market price" a month ago, the annual rent for an ordinary shop is 3 billion legal currency, equivalent to 100 shi of rice. Moreover, since the housing shortage began, landlords have become more shrewd, stipulating that rent must be paid in advance. 100 shi of rice may not be a difficult word to bear in a city, but in an inland city like Shashi, merchants need to consider this burden. In fact, how many people today in Shashi can find a shop to do business with more than 500 shi of rice worth of capital? After paying the rent and decoration fees, most of the capital is gone. Is this the way to do business? They know it's difficult and retreat, only to run single, trading smuggled goods to South China.

Shashi is a producing market, and consumption can never catch up with production.

The Shanghai exchange rate and the Hankou exchange rate also indirectly affect the market. The Shanghai exchange rate can reach 70% or even 60% at its highest, and the cheap smuggled goods from South China cause inland consumers to shift their goals to Guangzhou, which is strongly supported by the abnormal Shanghai-Hankou exchange rate. Here, Shanghai goods are sometimes cheaper than in Shanghai, which is a byproduct of the abnormal exchange rate. This abnormal state benefits a small number of consumers in the interior; and it hurts a large number of farmers who produce. If the inland exchange rate continues to develop in this state, the result will inevitably affect the outlet of agricultural products; and it will stimulate prices in the sales area.

The depression of Shashi may not be eliminated in the short term. Under the current overall situation, Shashi is the outpost of the Central China battlefield and the base of river defense. The depression of Shashi has its inherent factors. Therefore, everyone in Shashi places their hopes for eliminating these troubles on the success of the suppression of the rebellion and economic stability.

### Jiaxing Epiphyllum: Blooms and Withers Quickly

[Our Newspaper Jiaxing Fifteenth Dispatch] An epiphyllum given by Soochow University to the nursery of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Jiaxing Station five years ago suddenly bloomed at 8:15 pm on the 14th. The reporter received a call from the station and rushed to see this grand scene. The flower is planted in a pot, about three chi tall. The flower grows from the edge of the leaves, with a total of two blooms, the color is as white as jade, like a trumpet. It was in full bloom at 9:20 pm, then gradually withered, and withered after two hours.

### Anniversary Celebration of the School for War Orphans

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] The School for War Orphans has been established for a year. On September 18, a memorial meeting was held at the school in Suzhou, presided over by Bishop Yu Bin. Dozens of directors from Nanjing and Shanghai, including Wang Boyuan, Lu Yinggeng, Wang Xiaolai, and Cai Renbao, attended. The school currently has 188 students, divided into two departments: agronomy and cotton weaving. Food, lodging, books, and supplies are provided by the school. However, applicants must present a pension certificate or documents from their original unit or local government. After verification, only those who are confirmed to be war orphans are eligible for preferential treatment. Last year, the school also reclaimed 7,862 mu of wasteland in Taihu Lake, Wujiang County, as a farm site, and recruited 3,200 refugees from northern Jiangsu and poor farmers from nearby areas to build embankments and begin cultivation. In the future, the harvest will be divided equally between the cultivators and the school to provide for the education and upbringing expenses of the orphans. It is expected that in two or three years, the school will be able to become self-sufficient.

### Random Notes from Central China

— Our Newspaper Reporter Sang Jun

[Our Newspaper Kaifeng Fifteenth Dispatch] As soon as one enters Henan Province on the Longhai Railway, every foreign traveler has a novel feeling. The people of Henan are so respectful and yet so persistent towards the Yellow River! It is said that once Kaifeng held a civil service examination. In the answer to the question of flood prevention, one person wrote: First, more cattle and sheep should be raised, hoping that they will drink all the water in a few years. Second, it is hoped that Qin Shihuang will be resurrected and drive the mountains of Shanxi and Shaanxi to make dikes. This may be a joke, but the persistence of the people of Henan in the spirit of water management is admirable. As the autumn floods approach, the turbid waves of the Yellow River roar by the banks all day long, and the residents outside the dikes still operate so peacefully. Before the closure of the Huayuankou breach, Director Zhu Guangcai of the Engineering Bureau cried bitterly in anxiety, but one day, the river workers found a water snake by the dike, saying that the Fourth Dragon King of Jinlong had appeared, and the closure would be successful. Then everyone worked together with one heart, and everyone bravely rushed to close the breach, and it was completed immediately. This kind of persistent and simple force is so lovely!

The people of Henan are actually not only like this towards things, but even more so towards people. Liu Jingfu served as governor of Henan for many years. Because public sentiment was very agreeable, Mrs. Liu liked to cook Yellow River carp with cellophane noodles and chili peppers. The people of Henan learned it immediately and called it Mrs. Fish. In any restaurant in Henan, if you order "Mrs. Fish," the waiter will respectfully bring it up. After the defeat of the Communist army in the Central Plains War, wounded soldiers were transported to northern Henan. There was no medicine along the way, so the people were asked to wash their wounds with salt water. Many wounded Communists died along the way. This impression cannot be erased for the people of Henan. Chatting with a few farmers, they will tell you too many stories: "The way the Eighth Route Army treated human life was really immoral!" In the Yellow Flood Area, they pointed to the white bones left behind in those "human wave tactics," "The Eighth Route Army soldiers were also raised by their parents!" Without guidance and propaganda, the consciousness of humanitarianism made them affirm the decline of the Communist army.

The people of Henan still tell stories about the Communist army's

deflated state during battles. Distant artillery fire is always inaccurate. When attacking the Songmen gate in Kaifeng, many howitzers had to use machine gun cover, pushed directly to within one or two hundred meters of the city wall before daring to pull the string. Later, when Kaifeng fell, the Communist army used all their housekeeping skills. On the street, the broadcast of the Communist headquarters was being rebroadcast, earnestly declaring that they would never disturb the people. At the same time, nearly a thousand Communists changed into civilian clothes and broke into the largest Tianfeng Flour Mill in Kaifeng. 2,800 bags of wheat, 70,000 sacks, more than 3,000 shi of flour, dozens of machines, and even the bedding and luggage, doors and windows, and benches of the employees were all looted in one fell swoop. Later, a column commander named Chen expressed his condolences to Chen Xuchu, the manager of Tianfeng, and said: Does your factory need relief? Chen Xuchu replied angrily: It would have been better if you hadn't robbed us. I don't think you can make up for my five trillion loss! In the end, Chen requested that he be arrested. The column commander was puzzled, and Chen said: Because I want to see Mao Zedong and ask him how to explain that set of "fighting for the liberation of the people"?

The people of Henan are now emotionally lonely. The excessively heavy burden of military grain, the sub-standard impoverished life, and the fact that the people in the rear rarely understand it, that's fine. What is most embarrassing for the people of Henan is that the rich households in this province are also moving to the rear. How mysterious is the rear? Isn't the forefront the most stable? They believe that only the forefront is the most reliable, prices are stable, and the military and civilians are integrated. They also believe that the military situation will soon be developed. They hope that

After the military situation develops, politics can be effectively taken over. They also forgive the difficulties of the local administrative authorities. It is quite difficult to compete with the Communists in a "poor" environment. But this era is an era where everything must be competed for! Politics needs competition, and military affairs need competition. They said: We are also competing with the people in the Communist areas! If we don't eat millet, we eat black sorghum. If we don't wear clothes, we go naked. We hand everything over to the government, and the Communists will collapse sooner or later! For this group of compatriots living in strong and persistent emotions, it is our responsibility not to let them feel lonely in spirit!

Student Relief Committee
Reduces Autumn Program
[Our newspaper] The summer work-study program organized by the Shanghai Student Relief Committee of the YMCA ended in the middle of this month, and reports from various schools are being compiled. The autumn work-study program, which the committee will continue to organize, has been drafted, and the relief target is expected to be 400 students from 13 universities and colleges. It is reported that due to limited donations from the United States this year, the scale of the autumn work-study program will be smaller than that of the summer program, but the work of providing soy milk to students in various schools will continue to be maintained.

Xiamen University Scheduled to Open
[Our newspaper] Although the National Xiamen University restricted registration in the Shanghai and Guangzhou exam areas to no more than 2,000 people, the number of applicants in this recruitment of new students in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other areas was still very enthusiastic, totaling more than 6,000 people. A total of 395 officially admitted students (excluding 50 guaranteed students from Taiwan and Jiangxi provinces) and 78 alternate students have been announced in early September. The registration period for current students is scheduled for September 25th to 30th, and classes will begin on October 1st. The registration period for new students is scheduled for October 2nd to 8th, and classes will begin on the 9th. With approval, the university will divide the College of Science and Engineering into the College of Science and the College of Engineering, and the Department of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering into the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Electrical Engineering, starting from this academic year. Currently, there are five colleges: Literature, Science, Engineering, Law, and Commerce, with 18 departments and more than 1,600 students and 300 faculty and staff. The university's recurrent expenses for the first half of the year, such as only 600 million yuan in June, will be 21 billion yuan per month in the second half of the year. The special expenses (construction and expansion improvement expenses) were allocated 2 billion yuan in the first half of the year and will increase to 93 billion yuan in the second half of the year (equivalent to more than 31,000 gold yuan).

Open Tennis Finals Today

Held at the Youth Tennis Club
The singles finals of the public tennis competition, including Guanqiu and Baoyi, are scheduled to start at 2 PM today at the Youth Tennis Club at 676 Xishan Road (formerly 454 Xishan Road). The tennis community has been anticipating this final for a long time. Unfortunately, last week's heavy rain prevented it, so the singles and doubles finals were rescheduled for today and tomorrow. Tennis fans have sent letters to the Youth Tennis Club requesting that the finals still be held on weekends to facilitate participation by office workers, but the Tennis Committee, due to repeated obstacles and delays in this open competition, is eager to finish it, unless there is a change in the weather, it will not be rescheduled.

Today's first match, the intermediate singles between Wei Shisun and Ma Jingrong, will start at 2:30 PM. It is hoped that Wei and Ma will arrive on time to avoid affecting the following matches. The second match is the women's singles between Yang Weibin and Zhu Zhiying. Judging by their skills, Yang has a better chance of winning.

The last match is the final between Ye and Tao. Whether Ye can continue to maintain the national championship honor and whether Tao can avenge his defeat in the National Games depends on the outcome of this battle.

Tickets are divided into one yuan, two yuan, and reserved seats for five yuan and three yuan. The order is as follows:

Railway Bureau Tennis Annual Competition
Small Victory Over the Ministry of Communications
The Ministry of Communications and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration have a tradition of holding an annual tennis competition, which is held alternately at the courts of the Ministry of Communications and the Railway Bureau. Yesterday was the third anniversary of the recovery of the two railway bureaus, and to celebrate, the third tennis competition was changed to be held on that day. The Ministry of Communications was led by Director Li Zubing of the General Affairs Department, along with the three musketeers of the Ministry of Communications' tennis team, Zhuang Liangrui, Shi Shiyuan, Zhang Jizeng, and Zheng Haoru, totaling 12 people. The Railway Bureau was led by Wang Zhaohuai and Mei Fuqiang, chairman and vice chairman of the Workers' Sports Association, along with players such as Guo Qida, Zhan Wanyao, and Zhong Shibao. There were 6 doubles groups and 11 singles groups. In each group, the results of the two-set matches showed that both sides had athletes from the National Games, and their strengths were evenly matched. The singles matches were won by each side in 11 sets, and the Railway Bureau won the doubles match by 7 to 5. The overall result was 18 to 16, with the Railway Bureau winning slightly over the Ministry of Communications.

National Arts Performance Concludes Successfully
The Northeast Branch of the Central National Arts Hall held a National Arts Performance Competition in Shanghai, which concluded successfully yesterday.

Under the leadership of Chairman Yu Bin and Director Li Daheng, the hall promoted the national quintessence, and the grand performance was an unprecedented event in Shanghai for decades.

Third Table Tennis League
Group B Fierce Battle Today
In the Third Table Tennis League, there will be seven matches today (21st), held in six different rooms. In Group B, Chunmao will play against Lianshi Jia in two matches. Lian Richang, the star player of the former team, has recovered from his hand injury and will decide to participate in the match tonight, greatly increasing his strength. The latter team has been demoralized since its captain Chen Pengyao has been absent several times, and has repeatedly requested a rescheduling. From now on, they must play according to the schedule. In addition, Muhuocai will play against the Jews at the Jewish Hall on Tangshan Road. The Jews have had one point deducted because the new star Jia Zhi was disqualified, which is a great advantage. If Muhuocai loses this match, it will give the Jews even more hope of winning the championship, which is a major concern for all the Chinese teams in Group B.

The day before yesterday, Hualianhua Lai of Group A had sufficient stamina and defeated Qinglian 5 to 4. The results of both sides and today's schedule are recorded below:

(Hualianhua) (Qinglian)

The Inside Story of Marshal Eisenhower's Refusal to Run for President Liu Tai
Marshal Eisenhower's achievements in this great war are outstanding and have become the only figure in the United States who can be supported by the whole country. Many people believe that he has the greatest hope in this year's American election. However, he resolutely refused to run and settled down as the president of Columbia University.

Why did he resolutely refuse to run, even at the cost of disappointing countless people in the country?

Here is an answer. The original author of this article is Eisenhower's friend, Marquis W. Childs, who is now lecturing at Columbia University. He is a famous writer and has a deep relationship with Eisenhower.

As early as a year ago, when Eisenhower was still the Chief of Staff, many friends often visited him. After the greetings, they talked about politics, and everyone indirectly asked him about his opinions on the election. Eisenhower was not very happy and said, "My old friends are all like this, which is really unexpected. I tell them that I have no intention of running for election, but they always don't believe it. Just look at their smiles..."

But the politicians in Washington still wore that kind of half-believing smile, and they still didn't believe that he really had no intention of running for election.

Last December, Eisenhower and his wife attended a grand banquet. Vandenberg and Taft were also present. Everyone happily raised their glasses and chatted. Eisenhower inadvertently talked about the gains and losses of domestic politics. As soon as he opened his mouth, everyone else stopped talking and listened to him quietly. He said that most of the labor-management disputes were caused by both sides being selfish and disregarding the overall situation. He admitted that inflation had reached a terrible level. He hoped that the capitalists could take the lead in reducing profits and saving the crisis.

Okay, all the politicians present unanimously believed that he was going to run for election - in their view, these words were clearly the tone of a candidate announcing the outline of his policies!

A few days later, a current affairs commentary was suddenly broadcast on a radio station. The radio commentator said: "General Eisenhower, who may participate in the general election, has expressed his opinion on curbing inflation. He suggested that the government convene the heads of the national business community and put pressure on them to force them to stabilize prices within two or three years, and any profits will not be allowed... General Eisenhower said that if the business community refuses to cooperate, Congress should pass a bill to levy a 100% profit tax, and the tax revenue will be used to subsidize various companies, and the government will force price suppression."

This was of course a distortion of the facts, with the purpose of deliberately embarrassing Eisenhower. The two reporters present immediately denied it on his behalf, but Eisenhower himself did not express any opinion. Unexpectedly, a distinguished guest suddenly arrived at the Army Department and said, "This kind of distortion is really outrageous. I am willing to provide written proof that you did not say such a thing."

This distinguished guest was Vandenberg, who held a pivotal position in the Congress.

However, Eisenhower advised him not to do so, and advocated letting it take its course. From then on, Eisenhower's friendship with Vandenberg deepened, and Eisenhower also understood that some people in the Republican Party were trying their best to attack him.

By the end of the year, the movement to support Eisenhower became even more enthusiastic. A Republican with a very high status came to urge him to run, but Eisenhower said, "I know your party doesn't want me."

Finally, Eisenhower wrote a letter with even firmer wording to those who supported him, clearly stating that he would not run. He said that the United States has no shortage of talented people who can be worthy of this position. He came from the military and cannot take this important position, and the United States does not need a military man as president.

At that time, he accepted the position of president of Columbia University, but rumors immediately arose, saying that the president of the university was just a bridge between the General Staff Headquarters and the Presidential Palace. Eisenhower ignored it.

The drama on the Republican side had just ended, and the Democrats came again.

It is an undeniable fact that President Truman's reputation has declined. The Democratic Party is eager to find a person who is supported by the public to replace him - Eisenhower is naturally the most suitable person. Therefore, as soon as he sat down in the president's office of Columbia University, distinguished guests from the Democratic Party came one after another. At least eight senators and six governors had come to persuade him to run, but Eisenhower's answer was still a "no".

In fact, there are indeed many people in the Democratic Party who support Eisenhower. Southern party members support Eisenhower because they oppose Truman's civil rights bill, but left-wing party members, New Deal factions, labor union leaders, etc. have also expressed enthusiastic support. Only James Farley, a veteran of the Democratic Party, said that if Truman refuses to step down voluntarily, Eisenhower will not come out. Later, Eisenhower told others that he agreed with Farley's statement.

On June 6, the results of the public opinion survey were: Eisenhower was the most popular person in both the Democratic and Republican parties. Eisenhower naturally saw it very clearly. When the Republican Party and the Dewey faction united to ask Eisenhower to run again, he couldn't help but smile. He said, "They want to use me to win - I am not happy to be a wedding dress for others like this." He issued two written statements in a row, with decisive and irreversible wording, and the situation was clarified.

Eisenhower's intentions are very deep. On the one hand, he felt that his prestige could play a greater role when he was outside the political circle. On the other hand, it is very difficult for a soldier to be president. If he reorganizes the military and strengthens it, others will criticize him for being biased towards the military. If he deliberately relaxes in military affairs, the current relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is already so tense, how can he delay the overall situation? Eisenhower's resolute refusal to run for election is a fundamental reason.

Biography Sobei
According to statistics from the Library of Congress in the United States: There are five people in the world with the most biographies written about them, including:

There are 5,152 books written about Jesus Christ; 3,172 books about Shakespeare; 2,319 books about Lincoln; 1,755 books about Washington; and 1,735 books about Napoleon I.

On Remembering Ye Juchang Qian Dacheng
The "Record of Book Collection Affairs Poems" written by Ye Juchang (Changchi) of Wumen is a major anecdote for book collectors. Scholars of plate versions in the world cannot seek it outside of this. Last year, I purchased his old collection of "Looking Up at the Thousand Seven Hundred and Twenty-Nine Crane Studio Series" at a bookstore in Suzhou, with two collection seals "Changchi" and "Yuan Du", and two long postscripts. One was signed "Early Autumn of Wuzi" and the other was signed "May 29th of Guangxu Bingxu", calling himself Jiren, which was only twenty days after his mother's death. Examining Juchang's "Yuan Du Studio Diary Notes", Juchang was 38 years old in Bingxu and 40 years old in Wuzi. "Looking Up at the Thousand Seven Hundred and Twenty-Nine Crane Studio Series" was published by Zhao Huishu. Juchang's handwritten postscript stated: "Huishu's collection of secret books in four boxes are all unseen in the world, and he planned to publish them one by one, but he only completed four volumes and passed away suddenly; his son continued to engrave the fifth volume, and its contents were still determined by Huishu's handwriting..." and so on. This book of Juchang was given to him by his friend, a certain observer. In the autumn of Guangxu Yiyou, Juchang planned to go to the capital, passed through Shanghai, and stayed in Jixianli. He received a letter from his uncle, informing him that his mother was seriously ill. He returned to Wumen in a hurry, and the trip to the north did not materialize. The following year, his mother passed away. Volume 3 of "Yuan Du Studio Diary Notes" Yiyou, records this event with few details, and the dates are also slightly different, for unknown reasons.

Although Juchang was proficient in the study of plate versions, his family had few fine books. He once said: "I grew up in the countryside and lived off Dongling, and I was accustomed to hearing about making a living. Although I love books, I cannot stop discussing prices, and I missed the opportunity to acquire fine manuscripts and secret scrolls. Every time I think about it, it is like a pearl without an elephant net, which cannot be obtained again. In the eighth consciousness field, I left a bag of grain seeds, which has been eradicated for thirty years but has not been completely eliminated. Alas, what can I do!" Juchang was proficient in appraisal, no less than Yaopu Jianbin. But he was troubled by financial constraints and could not accumulate everything for himself, so he sat and watched good people bundle and carry them away. Hundreds of Song and thousands of Yuan books were only like passing clouds.

Those who were as famous as Juchang in the study of plate versions were none other than Miao Yifeng. However, Juchang once ridiculed Yifeng for possessing the skills of Liqiu. The so-called Liqiu refers to the ghosts of Liqiu who can transform into human form, according to the "Lushi Chunqiu". So Juchang's ridicule of Yifeng was already very extreme. In his later years, Yifeng relied on compiling catalogs or appraising fine books for a living. Juchang also once proofread the Four Histories for Liu Hanyi. The two often met at sea, but why were they so outwardly harmonious but inwardly estranged? This cannot be investigated.

Juchang was also proficient in the study of epigraphy, and wrote a book called "Yushi". He also had many rubbings of inscriptions, which he sold for rice in his later years. He died in the Republic of China Dingyi at the age of sixty-nine, without an heir. His diary was deleted and edited by Wang Jilie, and his daughter's husband, Wang Xinkui, published it in stone print. The diary contains quite a few anecdotes from the late Qing Dynasty, but unfortunately, the words in which he ridiculed people have been deleted, so it cannot be called perfect. Fortunately, his manuscript was donated to the Suzhou Provincial Gang Library the year before last. Scholars who study the history of the hall and plate versions can easily go there to see his true handwriting.

The Name in the Clouds Bai Jiao
Inscription on a Orchid Painting
Gao Yang's short brush cannot capture the spirit,
The mood at dawn has already turned to dust,
Leaving behind a cool sadness to inscribe on the painting,
I can send tears to her.
What is there in this world that is truly magnificent?
After drinking, I still seek the lonely shore.
Joy and sorrow fill the sky of Wu with wind and rain,
Current trends praise the Jade Hall in spring.

Evening Drink
Create my Luzhou, issue royal lees,
Rope-like autumn rain earns coolness in return,
The empty hall feels like a triple happiness,
The lonely embrace finds it hard to dispel a hundred thoughts of ash.
The young child has never understood sadness,
War has never spared talents!
Looking back after thirty years, it's all trivial,
I will face the middle stream and strike the oars.

New York Fang Hong
The people under the jurisdiction of New York Mayor William O'Dwyer total eight million. There are more Irish people in New York City than the population of Dublin—500,000, more Jews than the population of Palestine—2 million, and almost as many Italians as the population of Rome—1,095,000. It also has 412,000 Polish people, 57,000 Czechs, 54,000 Norwegians, and 53,000 Greeks. 500,000 black people crowded into New York City. Mayor O'Dwyer is also the commander-in-chief of a huge army—19,000 police officers, 11,000 firefighters, and 120,000 other civil servants.

In one day, New York City uses up more than one billion gallons of water, transports in 23,500 tons of food, and discharges one billion gallons of sewage and more than 8,000 tons of waste. In winter, it needs 20 million gallons of fuel oil every day. Every day, 6 million citizens travel on its 237-foot-long subways and trams, 1.5 million people walk on the road surface, and nearly 400,000 merchants pour into New York City from Long Island, New Jersey, and the suburbs of Connecticut—a train pulls into New York Station every 50 seconds, day and night.

American Locations Cang Yu
The efforts of the United States to solve the housing shortage can be seen from the recently announced figures. From August last year to March this year, a total of 400,024 houses were built, and another 105,742 are under construction. In March alone, 9,451 houses were built.

Major grocery stores in the United States have a new device, which is to irradiate groceries with purple light before housewives leave the store, making the goods less likely to be damaged.

According to the report of the U.S. Department of Education, 1,753 colleges and universities in the United States accommodate more than 2.33 million students, of which veteran students account for 48% of the total. The five universities with the most students in the country are New York University (46,000 people), the University of California (43,000 people), Columbia University (31,000 people), the University of Minnesota (28,000 people), and the University of Illinois (26,000 people).

Pen and Inkstone You Mojun
In Mr. Yiyun's article "Paper and Pen" published in this journal (September) 8, he quoted Li Shi's Continued Record of Natural History: "Wang Rui said, there should be pens since the beginning of writing," and the story of Confucius writing the Classic of Filial Piety with a hairpin and a floating pen, to prove that the pen was not invented by Meng Tian. According to Huainanzi Benjing Xun: "Cangjie created writing, and the ghosts cried at night." What does creating writing have to do with "ghosts" that it makes them "cry at night"? It's too mysterious and incomprehensible! Han Gao You's note says: "Ghost may be written as 'rabbit'. The rabbit is afraid of being taken to make a pen, harming its body, so it cries at night." This explanation is more reasonable. Therefore, if writing was invented by Cangjie, and the "rabbit crying at night" is used as corroborating evidence, then pens already existed during the time of Cangjie. Also, according to Shangshu Zhonghou, a divine turtle carried a picture, and the Duke of Zhou assisted in writing it down. Whether the strange story of the divine turtle carrying a picture is credible is another matter; but the recorder of this event, if there were no pens during the time of the Duke of Zhou, how dare he use the word "pen"? Therefore, to go back a step, pens already existed before Confucius. Liang Zhangju in his Left Trace Collection said this very clearly, but he did not say who created the pen. According to the Record of Things, Yu Shun made a pen and wrote with lacquer on bamboo slips. I don't know if this is credible.

The pen cannot be separated from the inkstone, just like it cannot be separated from paper. Mr. Yiyun has already mentioned in his article that paper was not made by Cai Lun, so I will not discuss it further. Who made the inkstone is worth discussing. Zeng Guofan's Seeking Deficiencies Studio Reading Record says: "The inkstone is also called the ink sea. The Yellow Emperor obtained a jade knot and made it into an ink sea, with the inscription 'Emperor Hong's Inkstone'." According to this, the first person to make an inkstone was the Yellow Emperor, which was at the same time as Cangjie. As for the maker of ink, it is said to be Xing Yi, see Brahma Studio Record. According to Shiben, Zhong You made the inkstone. That is, the inkstone only existed during the Zhou Dynasty. I don't know if this is credible.

During the Han and Wei Dynasties, calligraphers emerged in large numbers, and the inkstone was the most prominent. At that time, tile inkstones were used, so the inkstone was also called "tile inkstone". The Tang Dynasty had the Fengchi inkstone. According to Mi Yuanzhang, it was concave in the middle to hold ink. Concave means it was also like a tile. This inkstone must have been made of stone.

Researchers of inkstone collections say that smoothness is the virtue of the inkstone, and ink production is the talent of the inkstone. Chengni is smooth but does not produce ink, having virtue but no talent; She inkstone produces ink but is not smooth, having talent but no virtue; the one that combines both is the Duan inkstone. As for ancient brick inkstones, they always seem to lack both virtue and talent, so they can only be regarded as antiques.

Professor Slapped Song Qu
According to the "Su Bao" published on the 9th of this month, Professor Zhang, of the Physics Department of National Henan University, went to a certain hotel on Guanqian Street after arriving in Suzhou with the school, wanting to open a room as a temporary place to stay. Unexpectedly, the hotel tea server, upon hearing that Professor Zhang was a refugee from Henan, refused him on

### Money Market Still Loose - Banks Show Large Debit Balances

Yesterday, the money market in this city moved as it did last week, exceptionally loose. In the clearing of bills among silver and money businesses, the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury again showed large debit balances, totaling 2,830,000 yuan. Among them, the Central Bank debited 1,050,000 yuan, the Bank of China credited 400,000 yuan, the Bank of Communications debited 680,000 yuan, the Farmers Bank debited 850,000 yuan, the Central Trust Bureau debited 260,000 yuan, the Postal Remittance Bureau debited 120,000 yuan, the Central Cooperative Treasury debited 270,000 yuan, large exchanges by commercial banks credited 780,000 yuan, small exchanges credited 500,000 yuan, and foreign banks debited a total of 460,000 yuan.

Each depositor is limited to using one checkbook from each bank at a time.

### 10,000 Dan of Tung Oil to be Sold to the United States - Currently Negotiating Shipping

It is learned that in response to the request of American merchants, China's export industry will soon ship 10,000 dan of tung oil to the United States. Shipping is currently being negotiated. Chinese tung oil has always been more profitable when sold to the United States. In the past, it was despised by American merchants due to adulteration of quality. Now, in order to regain past reputation, exporters are striving to improve quality, so the export volume of tung oil has recently been better than before.

### Export Goods in Short Supply - Market Presents a Sluggish Situation

[Report from this newspaper] According to the Export Control Committee: The domestic and foreign prices of general export products remained relatively stable last week (September 10 to 17). However, as it is currently a time of shortage of export commodities, and many foreign merchants are also on vacation, there are few large transactions in the market, and the export situation is inevitably somewhat sluggish. Although the tung oil market is stagnant, the price in the producing area has slightly fallen back, and the foreign market price has also recovered to above the price limit. According to the latest London telegraph, the tung oil market turned favorable at the end of the week, and C.I.F. importers were eager to buy. Loose cargo has risen to £158 per ton, and packed cargo has increased to £162. Pig bristle trading is still prosperous. The foreign price of Tianjin No. 33 long bristle (per pound) F.O.B. US dollar price of $9.40 is slightly lower by one dime compared to last week, but the rest remain unchanged. The foreign tea market has been active this week. North Africa and other places are deeply satisfied with our tea samples and have telegraphed orders one after another. Green tea is especially popular, and the estimated order quantity has reached as many as 5,000 tons. The United Kingdom has also opened up imports of high-quality tea, but unfortunately the tea price in the producing area is still rising recently, and the inventory in this street is gradually becoming depleted, and the export prospects are slightly worrying. The export situation of other goods such as cloth, sausage casings, goose feathers, and leather is still good, and the rest are just average.

### Tunxi Mao He Firm and Stable

The domestic tea market, which has been fluctuating narrowly for several days, still lacked volatility in the two batches of inflows and outflows yesterday. As for the foreign tea market, after the raw tea in the Tunxi producing area tended to rise, the arrival of goods from various sources gradually became scarce. Therefore, the main holders here, in view of the trend of inventory depletion and the increased future cost burden, also showed a tendency to hold on. Although exporters inquired, for this year's Jiangtun Daban and Zhong Qimen, etc., each dan was offered at around 189-190 yuan, and although transactions were launched, the potential was firmer than before.

According to people in the industry, currently there are many frequent telegrams from North Africa, mostly requesting tea samples and inquiring about prices. Judging from this situation, it can be seen that the foreign demand for Chinese tea is urgent. Therefore, if Chinese tea merchants can supply smoothly, the export volume this year should be even more considerable.
