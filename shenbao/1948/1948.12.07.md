### The Development of the Battle of Bengbu-Su County Becomes Increasingly Clear: National Army Forms Encirclement of the Enemy; Powerful Army Corps Capture Linhuanji Going South

[Report from our Bengbu Bureau, 6th] With the National Army taking the initiative, the Battle of Bengbu-Su County is progressing smoothly, with the battlefront of the Huang [Wei] Army Corps as its focal point. Our correspondent presents the current war situation based on a compilation of intelligence from various sources: The Huang Wei Army Corps is positioned in the area between the Hui and Fei Rivers, about 50 li north of Su County, more than 70 li southwest of Mengcheng, and 60 li east of Guzhen, including strongholds like Shuangduiji, Luoji, and Dayingji, an area spanning about 15 li. They are attracting the main forces of the Liu [Bocheng] and Chen [Geng] bandits, conducting external attacks. Of the 150,000 to 200,000 bandits there, a portion of their main force is positioned on the north bank of the Hui River and the south bank of the Fei River, while another portion is divided on the northwest and southeast ends of the Huang Army Corps' position. Using the Hui and Fei Rivers as support, they have formed an oblique defensive line, with the entire formation resembling an irregular hexagon. The Huang Army Corps has fought fiercely for more than ten days, annihilating the remaining bandits while making daily progress. The situation on the southern front is completely different from the battle of Nianzhuang on the eastern front of Xuzhou. On the eastern route, the army corps moving south from Xuzhou is advancing along the railway. Due to the numerous rivers near Fuliji, they are overcoming difficulties and making steady progress, poised to strike the rear of the Liu bandits. The central and western routes captured Linaoji yesterday and are about to cross the Hui River southeastward and move towards the Huang Army Corps. The Li and Liu Army Corps, based in Bengbu, have now defeated the Chen bandits' 6th Column and are rapidly advancing northwestward, and although there is resistance from the remaining bandits, it is only a spent force. Looking at the overall situation, the National Army's encirclement is already taking shape. The more than 500,000 troops of the six major army corps – Qiu Qingquan, Huang Wei, Li Mi, Li Yannian, Sun Yuanliang, and Liu Ruming – in this battlefield are expected to join forces soon, and the Liu, Chen, and other bandits will have no way to escape their fate of total annihilation.

[Report from our Bengbu Bureau, 6th] The development of the Battle of Bengbu-Su County has progressed to a stage more favorable to the National Army. Currently, the northern and southern armies continue to make significant progress. One regiment of the 6th Column, stubbornly resisting at Lao Cao and Lao Ji, has been completely annihilated by the National Army after three days and nights of fierce fighting, and the area has been captured. The right-wing forces, flanking westward from near Wangzhuang on the east side of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, captured Xinqiao Station on the 6th, and advanced westward alongside the central route forces, completing the longitudinal axis of the army corps attacking northwestward in the area between the Hui and Fei Rivers. As the horizontal axis, the elite troops on the north bank of the Fei River are pressing hard on the remaining bandits, who are resisting and blocking them, and are advancing north step by step, having reached a distance of 10 to 15 li from the north bank of the Fei River, pursuing and advancing against the 6th Column bandits who are slipping northwest. The western wing of the three armies moving south from Xuzhou has captured Linaoji, only two days away from the position of the Huang Wei Army Corps. The Huang Army Corps continues to fiercely attack the main force of the Liu bandits between the Cang and Fei Rivers, and the air force based in Jing and Bengbu is also constantly flying over the bandit positions day and night to bomb them. Military personnel have expressed that the time for encircling and annihilating the remaining Liu and Chen bandits is not far off.

[Report from our Bengbu Bureau, 6th] Evening, 10 PM, 6th: The National Army's unit attacking west from Xinqiao has reached Heji (15 li west of Xinqiao). The left pincer force reached the Zhangdian-Zhanggongying line on the evening of the 6th. After the army corps moving south from Xuzhou captured Linhuanji, they engaged in fierce fighting with the remaining forces of Chen Yi blocking their advance on the south bank of the Hui River on the 6th. The pressure on the Liu bandits facing the Huang Wei Army Corps has been greatly reduced. Today, with the assistance of the air force, that unit continued to capture more than a dozen villages around their position. This is clearly due to the impact of the strong pincer attack by our northern and southern armies.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Military News: The 28th Regiment of the 10th Division of the bandit army's 4th Column was blocking the advance of our National Army in the Chulan area (south of Xuzhou). Several of our tanks and armored vehicles, in coordination with a certain unit of the National Army, attacked the bandit army. The tanks attacked from the northeast corner, and the armored vehicles blocked the bandit's reinforcement troops to the southwest. On the afternoon of the 6th, they entered the villages in the Chulan area, and an entire battalion of the bandit army was annihilated. Five truckloads of light and heavy machine guns and important military supplies were seized, and more than 300 bandits were captured.

### The Detachment in Nianzhuang Unfortunately Loses Contact; Huang Baitao Dies a Heroic Death; A Model Soldier of Generosity and Righteousness for All Time

[Report from our Nanjing Bureau, 6th] The heroic death of General Huang Baitao has been confirmed by Yang Yanyan, Deputy Commander of the 25th Army who participated in the Battle of Nianzhuang. Deputy Commander Yang was among those who broke through with General Huang Baitao on November 22nd. On the afternoon of the 22nd, Deputy Commander Yang was one of the people who tried to dissuade General Huang from committing suicide when he drew his gun and heroically sacrificed himself. After General Huang's death, Deputy Commander Yang also buried his body. Yang escaped and arrived safely in Nanjing a few days ago. According to Yang's statement to reporters on the 6th, General Huang wore all his medals on his chest before his death. However, he was not injured before committing suicide. At that time, his troops had been almost completely wiped out. General Huang, in order to repay the country, did not change his mind about sacrificing himself despite Yang's repeated dissuasion. Before committing suicide, he verbally asked him to report to the President and instructed Yang to cremate his body and destroy all traces to prevent it from being captured by the communists for propaganda purposes. Yang spoke of the circumstances of General Huang's death with respect, repeatedly saying: General Huang's personality was truly great. Huang's body has been buried by Yang in a certain location, but to prevent the bandits from learning its location, its address is kept secret.

Details of His Death

According to a statement issued by the Military News Release Group of the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense: General Huang Baitao, Commander of the 7th Army Corps, was ordered to defend Nianzhuangwei, north of Caobaji on the Longhai Railway, during the Battle of Xuzhou. The battle with the bandits began at dawn on November 7th. His four armies, totaling about 70,000 men, were initially attacked fiercely by seven of the bandit columns. Later, they were continuously reinforced, and a total of thirteen columns were identified. The enemy bandits participating in the siege numbered about 200,000.

From November 8th to 17th, they fought fiercely with the bandits for ten days and nights. Commander Huang personally went to the front line, sharing the lives and hardships of the soldiers, commanding the officers and soldiers of each army to charge and kill the enemy, again and again, one after another. In ten days, they killed or wounded more than 100,000 bandits, captured more than 10,000 bandits, and seized more than 8,000 rifles, more than 1,000 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 20 artillery pieces. The National Army officers and soldiers suffered nearly 30,000 casualties.

On the 17th, the bandits concentrated all their forces and fiercely attacked Nianzhuangwei day and night, firing nearly 10,000 shells. Due to Commander Huang's heroic and decisive command, the position was repeatedly breached by the bandits, but it was always recovered, and they continued to defend it stubbornly. However, at that time, our army's food and ammunition were exhausted, and reinforcements were blocked by the bandits and could not arrive immediately. The bandits' reinforcements continued to increase. From the 18th to the 21st, the fighting became increasingly fierce for four days and nights. The fighting on the 21st was unprecedentedly fierce. We suffered more than 20,000 casualties, and the bandit army's casualties were at least double that of our army.

At that time, the casualties of Commander Huang's troops had exceeded 80%. The task of annihilating the bandit army had been largely accomplished. At dawn on the 22nd, on the orders of the government, he, together with Liu Zhenxiang, commander of the 64th Army, and Yang Tingyan, Deputy Commander of the 25th Army, led about two regiments and a small number of directly subordinate troops to break through to the west, hoping to join forces with the National Army on the western front. That afternoon, when they arrived at the area west of Wuzhuang in Nianzhuang, they were scattered and isolated by the bandits. Commander Liu lost contact. Except for a portion that completed their meeting with the westward advancing army corps, the officers and soldiers of the troops accompanying Commander Huang were almost completely wiped out, and all the accompanying guards were killed. Only Deputy Commander Yang remained with him, but he was also injured. At about 5 PM, Commander Huang stopped marching and said to Deputy Commander Yang: "This time, we have done our best in the battle. Now I have decided to die to repay the country, so I will not let down the heavy trust of the government, I will be worthy of the officers and soldiers who have died, and I will be able to repay the kindness of the President and Chief of Staff and maintain the integrity of my revolutionary soldiers. You have been injured, you can find a way to go back and report the course of this battle and my personal situation to the President, and tell all the senior officers and my friends and family." After saying that, he took out his business card and wrote with a fountain pen, "November 22, 1948, Huang Baitao, Commander of the 7th Army Corps, and Deputy Commander Yang Tingyan, loyally serve the country," and handed it to Yang. Yang repeatedly tried to dissuade him, but Commander Huang sternly told Yang to deeply understand the great righteousness and promote righteousness. He then took out the Mauser pistol that Yang was carrying and fired several shots at his head. The first two shots missed the vital point, and the third shot hit his brain, and he generously sacrificed himself and died a hero's death. Commander Huang's heroic sacrifice is a manifestation of the fine tradition of the revolutionary spirit of the Republic of China, and he can be a model for soldiers for all time.

### Legislator Proposes Political Reform; Launch General Spiritual Mobilization; Accuse the Soviet Union to the United Nations of Helping the CCP Threaten Peace and Antiquity; The Legislative Yuan Will Submit It for Discussion at Today's Routine Meeting

[Report from our Nanjing Bureau] Legislator Mu Chao and 131 others recently jointly submitted a request to the government to launch a nationwide spiritual mobilization, strengthen bandit suppression, reform politics, and complete national construction. They pointed out that if success in suppressing the rebellion and building the nation is to be achieved today, it is necessary to actively arouse the people's spirit, raise national awareness, promote the national spirit, and thoroughly reform politics, clarify right and wrong, strictly reward and punish, improve administrative efficiency, realize economic equality, improve the people's lives, and arouse the responsibility and sense of obligation of the people, so that everyone is a fortress for suppressing bandits and every family is a fortress for suppressing bandits, and jointly strive for suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. Therefore, the proposal lists the following measures: A. Regarding the theoretical aspect, the following should be clarified: (1) the nature of the communist bandit rebellion, (2) the meaning of bandit suppression, (3) the doctrine of national construction, (4) the fallacy of communism, (5) the promotion of morality, (6) the establishment of etiquette, (7) the determination of the outlook on life, (8) the importance of changing customs. B. Regarding the practical aspect, the following should be promoted: (1) organization (National General Spiritual Mobilization Association), (2) establishing common goals, (3) launching propaganda work, (4) restoring the small group discussion meetings of party, government, and military organs, (5) practicing frugality, (6) promoting legitimate entertainment. This case has been included in the discussion items on the agenda of the Legislative Yuan's routine meeting on the 7th.

[Report from our Nanjing Bureau, 6th] The proposal submitted by legislators Qi Zhihou, Bao Huaguo, Dou Zijin, Jiang Yiping, Yin Shuyi, and 22 others, regarding the Soviet Union's assistance to the CCP in occupying the Northeast and threatening world peace, proposes that the government file a complaint with the United Nations General Assembly and will be submitted for discussion at the Legislative Yuan's routine meeting on the 7th. Pan Chaoying and others had previously submitted a proposal of the same nature, and it was resolved by the General Assembly to be changed to an inquiry case, requesting the Executive Yuan to reply on whether there were effective measures against the Soviet Union's violation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty. The Executive Yuan had a written reply, but the members clearly expressed dissatisfaction with it. After several weeks of deliberation, this case was proposed again. The proposal briefly stated: The Soviet Union has never truly fulfilled the obligations given to the two countries by the Sino-Soviet Treaty, which has led to the CCP's rampant under its support. The establishment of the Sino-Soviet Treaty stemmed from the Yalta Agreement, but today all enlightened people in the world recognize the Yalta Conference as a shameful act of one allied country selling out another allied country, and even impartial people in the United States hold this view. However, our government dares not announce the facts of the Soviet Union's violation of the treaty, which is actually condoning aggression and misleading the country. Therefore, in order to make people at home and abroad understand the truth, the government should be requested to file a complaint against the Soviet Union with the United Nations General Assembly for moral and public opinion sanctions.

### Madam Chiang to Meet with Truman; New Economic Cooperation Aid to China Plan is About 300 to 400 Million US Dollars; Hoffman Flies from Washington to London

Madam Chiang will meet with President Truman early this week to make an informal appeal for greater assistance to China.

The attitude of the executive branch is even cooler than that of Congress. Chinese officials pointed out that Madam Chiang may issue a public announcement of her visit to the United States after meeting with President Truman. Also, Madam Chiang is expected to move to Washington in the middle of this week.

[Another dispatch] People close to economic cooperation believe that the aid to China plan for the 1950 fiscal year will be about $300 million to $400 million.

### President Weng Arrives in Shanghai; Awaiting Hoffman's Arrival

[Central News Agency, this city] President Chiang Kai-shek has specially dispatched Weng Wenhao, President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, to Shanghai to welcome Paul G. Hoffman, Administrator of the Economic Cooperation Administration, who will arrive in Shanghai on the 11th of this month. Weng arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and told reporters: "Mr. Hoffman's visit to China during our difficult times clearly demonstrates the spirit of cooperation of the Economic Cooperation Administration with us. At a time when countries around the world are suffering from the destruction of war or internal turmoil, as well as the suffering caused by floods, famines, and stagnant production, the United States is promoting the power of economic recovery and providing as much relief as possible to the economic poverty and suffering in various places. Only statesmen who are nurtured in the spirit of democracy and have foresight can understand the essence of the establishment of the Economic Cooperation Administration and implement it. Under Hoffman's leadership, the Economic Cooperation Administration has achieved remarkable achievements. The capable staff of the agency in China, under the guidance of Mr. Lapham, handle various tasks. Because of my relationship with the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, I have the convenience of maintaining regular contact with the huge working organization led by Mr. Hoffman, so I deeply appreciate the efficiency of the Economic Cooperation Administration. The agency has been able to overcome all kinds of difficult problems and establish a working organization that spans the world in a very short period of time. Mr. Hoffman has completed his inspection of his brilliant European undertakings, and now he will personally come to China to inspect the work of the agency in China, which I am very happy about."

### The Howard Newspaper System Predicts That the United States Will Decide on Its China Policy in a Few Days; Rogers Says That if China Falls to Communism, the U.S. West Coast Will Soon Be Attacked by Soviet Submarines

[United Press International, New York, 6th] Howard's newspapers said in an editorial on the 6th that U.S. policy toward China will be decided in the next few days. The U.S. government will decide in the next few days whether to adopt an active policy or let the facts create policy.

The editorial stated: Chinese Ambassador Dr. Wellington Koo has asked the Truman administration to issue a statement "sufficient to boost morale." "We believe that the Chinese government should receive such a show of support and confidence. Even if there are reasons we cannot know and therefore cannot publish the above statement, we should clearly state the position of the CCP in fact. If the U.S. government has no intention of recognizing the red government of the Northeast or North China, then we should declare it as such, lest the world suspect that U.S. officials may be "flirting" with the Communist Party again. It is said that our ambassador to China, Dr. Stuart, intends to remain in the city even if the CCP seizes Nanjing, and the State Department should acknowledge or deny this matter."

The editorial pointed out that after President Truman announced that he did not intend to send MacArthur to China, it was rumored that MacArthur was interested in a position in China and had drafted a technical plan to alleviate the military situation of the National Army. He further pointed out that General Wedemeyer's report on his visit to China has not yet been released. Therefore, we will ask whether we will still discuss this with the two men in deciding future U.S. Far East policy.

[Associated Press, New York, 6th] Howard newspaper writer Lovance published an article in the newspaper on the 6th, warning: "If China falls to a communist country, our western Pacific coast may be attacked by the developing Soviet Snorkel submarine fleet."

### Donate to Respect Teachers and Rescue Education - The Education Sector's Self-Rescue and Saving the Country Should Not Let the Industrial Sector Monopolize the Glory -

Since the lifting of price controls, commodity prices have been like wild horses running rampant, forming price turbulence, impacting every aspect of society, and the threat to the education sector is particularly serious. Therefore, in the education sector, municipal school teachers and staff have taken collective leave, and private schools have increased tuition for the second time. The municipal schools have improved the treatment of teachers and staff through government efforts, and the problem of collective leave has been satisfactorily resolved, but the private schools' increased tuition fees have only increased the burden on general parents, and a reasonable solution has not yet been obtained. The difficult lives of teachers are worthy of sympathy and should be improved, but the burden on general parents must also be taken into account, and there seems to be no win-win solution under the current circumstances. What is admirable is that at this time, some school authorities and teachers and staff are willing to endure hardship and hardship in order not to increase the burden on students' parents, and do not charge tuition fees for the second time. In today's morally depraved and profit-oriented society, this must be regarded as the supreme glory of the Shanghai education sector. A reader of this newspaper wrote to this newspaper, proposing to launch a donation campaign to respect teachers, which should be a source of pride and respect for those teachers with noble character.

Recalling since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the meager treatment and difficult lives of ordinary teachers are well known. Ordinary teachers, given the opportunity, invariably changed their minds, abandoning teaching and changing careers; those who can still settle down in the life of chalk and pen, cannot fail to recognize the sacredness of education, regard the school as a home, and regard students as children; even if their clothes are not adequate and their food and lodging are unstable, they must fulfill their heavenly duty of teaching people patiently and being a role model. During the War of Resistance, schools moved and teachers and students were displaced, but the education cause was never interrupted, thanks to the perseverance and outstanding spirit of our school authorities and all teachers. Now, in this period of quelling the rebellion, they have encountered unprecedented difficulties. Teachers can still stand in their posts and strive to fulfill their duties, which is really commendable.

We have also visited some public and private primary and secondary schools, even in the midst of economic chaos and social unrest, and there are still many schools where the music continues. We have also personally seen teachers reviewing homework late at night under dim lights, or forgetting to sleep and eat, preparing teaching materials, living in small rooms, and ignoring their wives and children who are crying for hunger and cold. This situation is deeply touching. Today's good teachers can be said to be the pillars of the turbulent times.

The culture of the country and nation depends on teachers to pass on, and the civilization of the world and mankind depends on teachers to broadcast. Therefore, teachers are like the relay race of the Olympic torch for national culture; for human civilization, they are like gardeners sowing seeds and old farmers plowing. The preface to the Book of Songs says: "The lush youth are me, happy to nurture talents. If a gentleman can nurture talents, the world will be happy." Therefore, the theory of respecting teachers is the same throughout ancient and modern China and foreign countries.

But if teachers worry about food and rice day and night, squeezing oil and rice, and even cooking, steaming, sewing, washing, feeding children, and raising babies, all of which must be done by themselves, how can they be expected to teach patiently between the white chalk and the blackboard? Moreover, as the cold winter approaches, the guests are dressed in thin clothes, shivering in the classroom, what further studies can be said? What is the difference between them and the soldiers on the front line, who are thinly clothed and fighting in the icy and snowy fields? "The cake is exhausted, it is a shame for the wife," the education of the state, of course, is the responsibility of the government, and social figures and students' parents should supervise and help them at any time and place, which is also a matter of reason.

Furthermore, now that the war to quell the rebellion is gradually improving, we are waiting for educators to take the overall situation into account, be firm and calm, explain the communist bandits' betrayal of the country and the chaos they have caused, and guide young people to rise up and defend themselves. The compatriots in the industrial sector of this city already have a unified organization for anti-communist and national salvation, and they are all generously donating money and effort to support the government's quelling of the rebellion. I dare to believe that the intellectuals who guide the people will not let the industrial sector monopolize the glory. Even if they are unable to contribute to the quelling of the rebellion due to economic difficulties and material aspects, teachers must still rely on them to clarify shame, teach warfare, inspire people, and boost morale.

Our newspaper's social service has always focused on helping students. This time, in response to readers' requests, we are raising money to respect teachers. At a minimum, we hope to enable teachers to teach with peace of mind. In fact, only when teachers can teach with peace of mind can students learn with peace of mind. Respecting teachers is also helping students. Based on the great meaning of "the greatest happiness is doing good," we earnestly hope that social figures will generously donate money and enthusiastically donate money. Instead of hoarding gold and banknotes, and disturbing themselves, fleeing far to Hong Kong and Taiwan, why not use their surplus living funds, half to dedicate to the soldiers to show their condolences, and half to donate to teachers to respect the teachers?

In short, respecting teachers and inspiring people is not only for the food and clothing of teachers in primary and secondary schools in this city. We are more convinced that the principals and teachers of primary and secondary schools in the city deeply understand the great righteousness and will not care about the amount of money raised to respect teachers or the timing of the distribution. If they can follow the instructions of the former sages "teach everyone without discrimination" and "tirelessly teach people", set an example and be a role model, they will surely gain greater and more sympathy from the society!

### Kuomintang Central Commemorative Week Zhang Daofan Reports on Impressions of Comforting Troops

Condemns the Phenomenon of Fleeing from Beijing and Shanghai

[Central News Agency Nanjing Sixth Dispatch] The Kuomintang Central Party Department held a commemorative week on the morning of the 6th. Chairman Ju Zheng, Zhang Daofan reported on the experience and impressions of going to Xuzhou to comfort the troops. Zhang pointed out that the communist bandits attacked Xuzhou with a force of 500,000 to 600,000, and our army was able to defeat the many with the few. He analyzed the reasons for our army's victory: our army's generals and soldiers gave their lives, morale was boosted, and the air force cooperated in combat, fully demonstrating the spirit of cooperation. However, the bandit army only used human wave tactics, driving poorly equipped troops to serve as cannon fodder. Zhang also said: The Battle of Xuzhou has now come to an end, and our army is dividing its forces to encircle and attack the bandit army fleeing south of Xuzhou, and is preparing for a large-scale annihilation battle. Our army is assured of victory. Zhang continued to point out that at present, when the front is winning victory after victory, the people in the rear should be calmed down. He condemned the phenomenon that some people in Beijing and Shanghai were confused by rumors and caused panic and escape, which was enough to affect the morale of the front. Zhang finally emphasized that the suppression of bandits and the quelling of the rebellion must implement total war, and all aspects of the party, government, and military must be coordinated and unified in order to achieve the final victory in quelling the rebellion.

### Mr. Chen Guofu Goes to Taiwan for Recuperation

He has been approved by President Chiang to go to Hepu for recuperation and has already taken the Zhongxing Ferry with his wife, Ms. Zhu Ming, Secretary Cheng Shijie, and Doctor Wu Di last night. During Mr. Chen's illness, all three positions of the Financial Committee, the China Farmers Bank, and the Central Cooperative Bank have also been approved by President Chiang, and Xu Kan, Chen Aishi, and Gu Zhenggang have been appointed as agents respectively. Since Mr. Chen fell ill with hemoptysis on July 18, he has been staying at the China Farmers' Guest House and has invited doctors such as Le Wenzhao and Cheng Kanzhen to treat him. During this period, his condition has been serious several times. Although the hemoptysis has stopped, the sudden cold climate in Shanghai has aggravated his cough, which has greatly hindered the closure of his lungs. Recently, his white blood cell count is still above 13,000. The attending doctor has repeatedly advised him to change places for recuperation, with a temperature of about 70 degrees being the most suitable. After signing a letter to President Chiang, he resigned from the position of Chairman of the Farmers' Bank in order to concentrate on recuperation. He was instructed to go to the Hepu-Xiamen area for recuperation. As for the various positions, he was not allowed to resign, but he could appoint special personnel to act as agents. According to Mr. Chen, he chose Hepu for recuperation, on the one hand because the climate there is suitable, and on the other hand because Hepu is a cultural and educational area, and the surrounding environment is particularly suitable for him. He is also confident that this recuperation is similar to the last time he was in Baihelin, Chongqing, and it may take eight months to recover. In addition to the past four months, it will take about three and a half months to return to Shanghai.

### UN Discusses Korean Issue: Our Proposal to Hear South Korean Representative's Opinion; US, Australia to Request UN Recognition of the Republic of Korea

[United Press Paris 6th Dispatch] The joint attempt by Britain and the Soviet Union to amend the agenda for the closing day of the United Nations General Assembly and give priority to the discussion of the Italian former colony issue failed on the 6th.

The UN Political Committee decided to discuss the Korean issue according to the regular agenda. Before the final vote, British Representative McNeil, who had instigated the amendment of the agenda, suddenly made a gesture of concession, and the Soviet Union's Eastern European bloc joined the British camp one after another. The Political Committee rejected the proposal to discuss the Italian colony issue before the Korean issue by a vote of eight to thirty-two, with nine abstentions. The entire case will be discussed again by this session of the General Assembly at a special meeting in New York next year. The Political Committee has begun to discuss the Korean issue, but it is extremely doubtful whether the case can be completed before the closing. Soviet Representative Malik and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Maniusky hinted that the Eastern bloc would adopt delaying tactics. They immediately began to call for inviting representatives of the North Korean government to attend and present their case, but Maniusky also admitted that it would take many days for the North Korean representative to come here from Korea. China suggested hearing the opinions of the South Korean government representative, which was seconded by US Representative Dulles. Maniusky accused Dulles of "cutting off" the Korean debate, discussing the Korean issue on the one hand, and on the other hand not listening to the opinions of the "real" representative of Korea. Knowing that discussing the Italian territory was hopeless, Britain again urged the General Assembly on the afternoon of the 6th to postpone the closing until after the originally scheduled evening of the 11th. The Political Committee made no progress on the procedural issue of which representative to listen to. Maniusky also condemned the South Korean election on May 10. Dulles said that the Soviet Union had betrayed the United Nations by refusing to participate in the United Nations Commission on Korea.

It is also heard that the bill will also ask the General Assembly to encourage better trade relations between the north and south regions of Korea.

### US, Britain and France Issue Joint Statement Condemning Soviet Division of Berlin; Door to Unified Currency Negotiations Not Closed

[United Press Paris 6th Dispatch] The governments of the United States, Britain and France today sent a lengthy memorandum to the Berlin Currency Research Association established by the United Nations Security Council, stating that the establishment of a communist regime in Berlin has caused new and serious problems. The Soviet Union should deny this communist regime, otherwise the hope of ending the Berlin blockade will be greatly dimmed. The Soviet side has not yet commented on this memorandum.

[United Press Paris 5th Dispatch] The United States, Britain and France jointly issued a memorandum tonight, accusing the Soviet Union of establishing a communist municipal government in Berlin, disregarding the wishes of the President of the United Nations Security Council. It is said that this action by the Soviet Union has buried the possibility of establishing a legitimate unified government in Berlin and made the unification of the Berlin currency more difficult. The President of the Security Council hoped that all countries would not take any action to worsen the Berlin crisis, but the various developments incited by the Soviet military headquarters in Germany have made municipal unification increasingly distant. On the afternoon of November 30, the Soviet military authorities condoned a series of incidents in their jurisdiction, occupying the legal municipal government and prohibiting it from exercising its legal authority in the Soviet military zone. A dramatic meeting carefully arranged by the Communist Party and the Communist Front organization created an institution with no legal basis, claiming to be the government of the entire city of Berlin. This illegal institution must not seize any of the powers of the legal government in the Western District, but only split the municipality.

### Change in Demarcation Line Between North and South Korea Denied; Korean Government Solemnly Denies; Communist Activities on Border Being Eliminated

[Central News Agency Seoul 6th Dispatch] Korean government spokesman Kim Dong-sung solemnly denied today that the true border between the Republic of Korea and North Korea under Soviet instigation is 48 miles south of the 38th parallel, that is, a section from Yangyue Mountain to Odae Mountain in Yanggu County, Gangwon Province, northern South Korea. It is because foreign news agencies have reported that "Korean officials have said that the North Korean People's Army has actually infiltrated into South Korea in the manner of a fifth column, and that South Korea's total mobilization to contain the above threat is necessary." Kim made the above denial because of this. Although he acknowledged the communist activities in Gangwon Province, he severely condemned the report on the North-South Korean border as "completely unfounded." He also said that the garrison "army" and the police are currently cooperating closely to suppress the communist activities in the area, with a view to eradicating small communist teams.

The Social Democratic Party led with 858,100 votes, followed by the Christian Democratic Party (conservative) with 258,496 votes, and the Free Democratic Party (right-wing) with 214,224 votes.

[Hong Kong News Agency Berlin 6th Dispatch] The results of the West Berlin elections have proven that Berlin is still the world of the Social Democratic Party on the one hand, and on the other hand, it is even more showing its anti-communist tendencies. The results of this election are exactly the opposite of the Social Unity Party's prior call for citizens to boycott this election.

[United Press Berlin 5th Dispatch] Only three political parties competed in the West Berlin elections. The Social Unity Party (Communist Party) did not participate. The 98 elected municipal councilors will elect the mayor and members of the executive committee of the municipal council. The parliament of the legal municipal government of Berlin originally had 130 seats, but the 32 seats other than the 98 seats are the seats of communist councilors, who have now established their own false regime, so 32 seats are left vacant.

[United Press Berlin 5th Dispatch] Germans in West Berlin flocked to the municipal election polling stations, which were open for twelve hours on the 5th, dealing a heavy blow to the prestige of the Soviet Union. The municipal election became a great expression of support for democracy and opposition to communism. According to the German Central Election Headquarters, about 1.481 million Berlin citizens participated in the voting, accounting for 88 percent of the total. The three parties participating in the competition closed the ballot boxes at 8:00 p.m. on the 5th and immediately began counting the votes. The vote counting was conducted in public to avoid possible accusations of fraud by the Communist Party. The parties participating in the election eliminated all differences between them and concentrated their efforts on expressing to the Soviet Union their attitude towards the measures taken by the Soviet Union. US Military Commander in Berlin Holle said that today's elections have proven to the world that the citizens of Berlin are fighting for democracy. West Berlin was tense all day, because it was rumored that the Communist "Action Team" would invade the Western District and fight with the police, but the real incident almost happened but fortunately did not happen. A total of 73 communist troublemakers who tried to interfere with the election were arrested in the Western District.

### Japanese Diet Approves Arrest of Ashida Hitoshi; Aiging (Tokyo) Prosecutor's Office to Begin Investigation Today

[United Press Tokyo, 6th] The Tokyo Prosecutor's Office has decided to summon former Prime Minister Ashida and two former members of the House of Representatives tomorrow morning for questioning regarding the bribery case.

[Associated Press Tokyo, 6th] The Japanese Diet passed a motion on the 6th to allow the arrest of former Prime Minister Ashida. Ashida is suspected of corruption in connection with the Showa Denko scandal, and the Tokyo District Court requested the Diet's permission to detain and interrogate him.

[Associated Press Tokyo, 6th] Ashida, the fifth Prime Minister of Japan after the war, will be arrested on suspicion of corruption.

The House of Representatives approved the arrest of Ashida and two other parliamentarians, Kitaura and Kawabashi, involved in the corruption case by a vote of 140 to 120 on the evening of the 6th. Previously, the House's joint committee had rejected the Tokyo District Court's request for arrest warrants by a vote of 12 to 9, citing insufficient evidence. A spokesman for the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office stated that due to necessary formal procedures, the arrest of Ashida and the other two would be delayed until the 7th. The Diet approved the arrest of Ashida after Prime Minister Yoshida pledged a comprehensive purge of corruption within government agencies to restore Japan's credibility both domestically and internationally, particularly in relation to attracting foreign investment. Ashida's arrest is undoubtedly a major blow to the Democratic Party. More than 20 Diet members and hundreds of local officials have been implicated in the Showa Denko scandal, and Ashida is strongly suspected of accepting a bribe of one million yen from the company as political campaign funds.

### Adapting to the Urgent Needs of Production Enterprises; Central Bank Discount and Loan Committee Approves Industrial Loans

Divided into Two Types: Finished Product Purchases and Collateralized Loans; Establishes an Emergency Loan Review Committee for Production and Export

[Our Reporter] Recently, due to the current situation, the sales of finished products in this city's industries have been slow, prices have plummeted, and the rising cost of living has resulted in huge expenditures, causing all industries to be in dire straits. The Industrial Association has resolved to request financial authorities to open industrial loans and implement the purchase of finished products in order to overcome the difficulties. At 11:00 AM yesterday, Speaker Pan Gongzhan and Director Du Yuesheng paid a special visit to Central Bank President Yu to discuss the matter. The Central Bank Discount and Loan Committee then held its 17th regular meeting at the bank's conference room on the Bund, presided over by President Yu, who also served as chairman. Deputy Chairman Liu Gongyun, committee members Xu Jiyu, Li Fuxun, Shou Miancheng, Qin Runqing, Li Shuming, Zhao Dihua, Gu Chunfan, Xi Demao, Cheng Yuanfan, and Li Lixia, Committee Member and Secretary-General Lin Chongyong, Deputy Secretary-General Fang Shangui, and Conveners of the Industrial and Mining Trade Advisory Committees Zhang Ziwu, Cai Gongchun, Li Daonan, and Chen Changtong, and 18 others attended to discuss the issue of emergency loans for production enterprises. Representatives from the industrial sector of this city, Hu Boxiang, Guo Yongxi, Chen Fengyong, and Xie Tiansha, were invited to attend and presented the difficulties currently faced by manufacturers and the urgency of waiting for emergency loans, requesting the authorities to open industrial loans in order to maintain operations, and presented four requests on the spot: (1) Issue 1 billion yuan in emergency industrial loans. The basis for this amount is that the wages of 400,000 industrial workers in this city are approximately 1,000 yuan per person per month, totaling 2,000 yuan for two months, totaling 800 million yuan; adding the need for production raw materials, the total is approximately 1 billion yuan. (2) The targets of the loans should be limited to truly needy factories, and the Central Bank should directly lend to each factory at low interest. The factories receiving the loans can mortgage raw materials, finished products, factory buildings, and machinery. (3) Request the government to purchase finished products at market prices. (4) Request prompt implementation in order to seize the opportunity. After the representatives left the meeting, all committee members conducted a thorough discussion for two hours. Finally, it was approved that in order to adapt to the urgent needs of production and export enterprises, loans should be granted. The loan method is divided into two types: purchase of finished products and collateralized loans, with the purchase of finished products as the main method. In addition to the finished product purchase method, which is still handled by the National Bank entrusted by the Central Bank in accordance with the previously established purchase method, the collateralized loan method still needs to be applied for to the Discount and Loan Committee through the National Bank or commercial banks. However, the operating status of the manufacturer and the need for assistance should be thoroughly investigated by the bank or money house undertaking the loan. The amount of the loan is strictly reviewed and approved by the Review Committee based on the actual situation of each manufacturer. The use of the loan funds after the loan is granted is also strictly audited by the Audit Department of the Central Bank at any time to see if it is used for non-production purposes or other improper matters. At the time, it was also decided that the review of finished product purchases and loans would be handled by the "Emergency Loan Review Committee for Production and Export Enterprises" composed of all members of the Industrial and Mining Advisory Committee under the Discount and Loan Committee and the two conveners of the Trade Advisory Committee. Lin Chongyong, Committee Member and Secretary-General of the Discount and Loan Committee, was also appointed as the convener of the Review Committee. As for the regulations for this emergency loan, the originally established Interim Rules for the Central Bank Discount and Loan Committee to Handle Interbank Discounts and Loan and the Measures for Handling Loan Review Cases will be revised and approved, and then implemented. The main points of the revision are: (1) The loan interest rate is calculated at 80% of the interest rate approved by commercial banks and money houses, and the Central Bank re-pledges at 90%, and the re-pledge interest rate is reduced by 20%. (2) The loan period is 30 days, and it may be extended if necessary. In addition to the above Interim Rules, which were announced by the Central Bank in early September this year, the Measures for Handling Loan Review Cases have also been approved by the Discount and Loan Committee to serve as a guideline for reviewing and handling loan procedures in the future. In addition, all relevant rules and application forms have been fully prepared by the Discount and Loan Committee and will be printed as soon as possible and distributed free of charge to all relevant parties for application. (For details on the Measures for Handling Loan Review Cases, see the left corner).

It is reported that the principle of opening industrial loans is no longer a problem, but the lending techniques, the assessment after the loan, and the supervision issues still need to be carefully considered.

The work of salvaging the bodies of the passengers who died in the wheel began the day before yesterday. On the morning of the 5th, at the request of the families of the passengers, the Bureau specially allocated a "Haihu" wheel to carry more than 300 family members of the victims, which started at 11:00 and arrived at the accident site at 3:00 pm. Amidst the turbulent waves, only the highest decks of the "Jiangya" wheel were exposed, and the family representatives were saddened by the scene and cried loudly. The "Haihu" wheel anchored 200 yards from the sunken ship, and then a tugboat carried the family members closer for inspection. The salvage sailors also started diving to salvage. Because there were only five sets of salvage tools, only 18 bodies were salvaged until dark, including nine men, eight women, and one child, which were loaded onto the No. 385 iron barge. At about 6:00 pm, the "Haihu" wheel returned to Shanghai, but due to the dense fog on the sea, it could not travel and anchored at sea. It started again yesterday morning and returned to Jinli Shanghai Pier at 10:00 am. The iron warship carrying the corpse was towed by the Guoshan Tug, and arrived at Jinliyuan Pier at about 11:00 am. Thousands of family members of passengers gathered at the dock, and there was an uproar of crying, and they rushed to identify them. China Merchants had negotiated with Tongren Fuyuan Hall in advance to temporarily bury the bodies, so all the corpses were transported to Zhuanyuan Hall after they were taken ashore.

Family Members of Passengers Organize Aftermath

However, the entire family members of passengers believed that China Merchants was proceeding too slowly with the salvage work, and accused that one of the salvaged corpses had a ring print clearly visible on its finger, but the ring was missing, and another suitcase had been broken. Also, some corpses have been soaked in water for a long time, and the salvage personnel used hooks to pull them out, causing the corpses to be blurred and difficult to identify, which seemed too cruel. Therefore, Ying Shifu, Hu Genlin, Zhou Fuzhang, Zhang Fubao, Chai Guojun, Shao Zhiming, He Yuxin, Zhang Zhiguang, Wang Naihan, Wu Wenbie, Lu Xiong, Zai Rongbin, Shi Jiuzhang, Guo Jingde, and Huang Ti'an were elected as representatives to form an Aftermath Committee together with the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association to negotiate with China Merchants to improve the situation.

Names of Four Corpses Identified

Four of the eighteen corpses salvaged and transported to Shanghai yesterday were identified by name: Hu Changliang, Xu Abing, no address. Liu Zhiliang, No. 52, Pu'an Road. Zhang Shanqing, No. 50, Heping New Village, Jinji Road, Xujiahui. As of yesterday, the Haiqian Wheel carrying the second batch of family members of the victims had not yet returned to Shanghai last night.

The Bureau has now established a Jiangya Wheel Aftermath Committee to handle the aftermath of the Jiangya Wheel accident, which is managed by Zhang Lisan, Deputy Director of the Personnel Office, and the Lv Yun Service Center at No. 33, Sima Road is used as the office, which has been opened for office yesterday. The family members of the victims requested the committee for three items: (1) Send more people to salvage, (2) Send mechanics to repair the telegram machine of the Ji'an Wheel dispatched on the 5th, (3) Send two more money barges for the accommodation of the salvage workers. They have been handled one by one.

### Both the Ningbo and Shaoxing Fellow Associations are Conducting Aftermath

The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association, considering that most of the victims of the Jiangya Wheel accident were Ningbo compatriots, specially convened an emergency meeting of directors, supervisors, and councillors yesterday, and resolved to organize the "Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association Jiangya Wheel Tragedy Aftermath Committee". The committee meeting was opened and the directors of each group were appointed to start work, and Liu Hongsheng and Huang Yanfang were appointed to negotiate with China Merchants on economic and all other liability issues. The Fellow Association will also lower the flag (the association flag) at half-mast for three days from the 7th to mourn the compatriots who died in the disaster.

The registration group of the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association Jiangya Wheel Tragedy Aftermath Committee will start working in the Fellow Association at the same time as the other groups from now on. The group hopes that (1) those who have survived in Shanghai, (2) those who have been rescued by other ships to other places will go to register. Also, people from all over the world who have salvaged the corpses of the victims are hoped to report to the Association, and all expenses will be paid by the Association.

### Shanghai Branch of Datong Bank: Manager and Deputy Manager Punished with Fines for Falsely Setting Up Secret Accounts

[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Shijing, a judge of the District Court, yesterday sentenced Liu Yiru, the former manager of the Shanghai branch of Datong Bank, and others, who were accused of violating the Banking Law, to fines.

It is reported that the defendant Liu Yiru resigned and handed over to his successor Chu Yuru on March 10 this year.

In addition to the secret accounts of Wanrenhao, Fuxingyi, Yangyida, Xingfenghang, Fulihang, Wanronghang, Hengfengchang, Wang Dongxun, and Yang Wanli, which Liu had set up during his tenure and had been closed, so they could not be used, he even followed his intention, imitated what he had done, and set up Wang Shenru and Yuanheng's secret accounts, and used the original name of the Huaxia Bookstore to deposit the repaid interest under the name of the secret account Wang Shenru, hoping to reduce cash in order to achieve the purpose of evading the payment of deposit reserve funds. He also used the pseudonym Yuanfengsen and other two accounts to embezzle bank funds from Jiangsu Provincial Bank to expand operating capital. After being discovered by others, he secretly reported to the Shanghai Financial Administration, which sent personnel to investigate and found evidence, and transferred the documents to the District Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution, which was completed and sentenced.

### Board of Directors Meeting Continued Yesterday: Decision on Personnel Issues of China Textile Construction Company: Chen Qitian Concurrently Serves as Standing Director and General Manager

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Board of Directors of the China Textile Construction Company held an interim meeting a few days ago. After adding three standing directors, it continued to hold a meeting at the company starting at 5 p.m. yesterday. As a result of the meeting, the final decision has been made on the company's personnel issues. Chairman Chen Qitian also serves as standing director and general manager, standing director Shu Zhenzhang is responsible for internal affairs, and standing director Tong Jiling is responsible for external affairs. Wu Weijing and Li Shengbo, the original deputy general managers, were retained to continue their original positions. In addition, Gu Baochang was also appointed as a deputy general manager.

It is said that the above-mentioned selected candidates are still a temporary measure for the transitional period. After the new general manager is selected, the reorganization will be considered. At yesterday's meeting, due to slight changes in the company's personnel, other issues such as how to transfer the company's accounts and business were also submitted for discussion, and separate decision-making methods were made.

In addition, Chen Qitian, chairman of the company, took the position of general manager of the company temporarily this time.

Popular yarns such as Shuangma were constantly sought after, reaching more than 10%, and 42-count Blue Phoenix closed at 12,500 yuan, up 1,100 yuan from the weekend.

### Constant Sucking by Customer Groups, Cotton Cloth Slightly Rises

Yesterday's cloth market was firm, and customer groups such as Sichuan and Hubei were still sucking hard. The opening prices of each cloth were low, and progress was seen in the middle. Before the closing, because the Tianjin group kept selling, and the appetite of all parties was gradually saturated, the transaction became sparse, and the market price rebounded again. As a result, it was slightly higher than last Saturday.

The opening price of Longtou fine cloth and Sizijun serge was 405 yuan each. Under the pull of retail investors, the market trend rose, and the price rose by about 20 yuan each. Recently, there were many people selling off, and the trend turned sluggish. Finally, the former closed at 410 yuan, up 20 yuan from the previous day, and the latter closed at 413 yuan, up 13 yuan. In addition, Wufu fine cloth sold for 375 yuan, 5225 umbrella floating cloth 410 yuan, Tiaoli floating cloth 416 yuan, and Sizijun yuanzhigong 430 yuan, all rising from 10 yuan to 30 yuan compared to the weekend.

### Silk, Satin, Rising

The artificial silk market turned firm yesterday. Due to the rise in the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates, the holders were unwilling to sell cheaply. The supply of chips on the market was not strong, and people were optimistic. The shouting price rose uniformly.

120 Tianqiao opened at 9,500 yuan in the morning. In the middle, the appetite of the silk weaving industry was not weak. The yarn and cloth rose, and the market was firm. The shouting price rose step by step, reaching a high of 10,500 yuan at the close. Dongyang Jin Sanma and other equally rose, and each grade rose by 1,000 yuan or 800 yuan compared to last week.

The situation in raw silk has improved in recent days, people's hearts are stable, the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates continues to rise, foreign sales have improved, the appetite of foreign firms has become stronger, and the shouting price has gradually increased.

D grade 87 evenness opened at 10,300 yuan in the morning, and transactions in the middle continued. Demand turned strong, and the price reached a high of 11,800 yuan. Afterwards, hoarders poured out at a high price, people's hearts were slightly tired, and the price also fell by 3-500 yuan, rising by 1,000 yuan. The sales of superior grade zero dan, ordinary zero dan, and Jiliganjing were still sluggish. The appetite of the local silk weaving industry was saturated, and the actual sales were not strong. Although the shouting price rose, the footing was still soft, and the market trend was not very optimistic.

The market for silk and satin bedding and other goods was still flat. However, due to the rising shouting price of raw materials in the yarn market, the market was struggling. The supply and demand on the market was still smooth, and the closing price rose uniformly. Huaqiang bedding opened at 7,000 yuan, and Meiya shouted at 7,100 yuan. Because the money supply was loose and the interest rate on the black market returned low, retail investors were thinking about moving, and the appetite was still smooth. The market price rose all the way, rising by 800 yuan at the close, and the rest rose equally.

### Rice Market Trends Still Weak: Southern Market White Glutinous Rice and Early Rice Fall into Fourth Level

Rice prices in both the northern and southern markets are unevenly weak. In the southern market, due to excessive gains last Saturday, relatively smooth arrivals, and low prices in the production areas, vendors could profit by reselling to production areas. Consequently, many sellers emerged, leading to a steady decline after the market opened. White glutinous rice and early rice fell within the 840 yuan range, each at 385 yuan, down 35 yuan from last Saturday. Late early rice was priced at 360 yuan. In the northern market, vendors initially attempted to raise prices, but lacked demand, and the market closed lower, leveling with last Saturday. Early rice and bleached rice each remained firm at 10 yuan. The total arrivals in both markets amounted to 12,401 piculs.

Flour

Continuing the strong momentum from last Saturday, the market remained firm. Vendors, taking advantage of the robust demand on this street, further increased prices. Old brand flour opened the most popular, at 140 yuan. Later, with more significant increases, prices slightly decreased to 137 yuan at the close, a gain of 7 yuan. Warship brand closed at 129 yuan. Miscellaneous brands were mostly around 130 yuan. Bran initially rose but then declined, ultimately settling flat.

Grains

Customer demand weakened again, sales were sluggish. Soybeans were flat. Sales of black soybeans were few, up 5 yuan. Selected green beans rose 10 yuan. Corn was slightly showy. Sesame had some sales on this street, prices were flat. Peanuts were not taken by southern merchants, down 30 yuan.

Cooking Oil

Initially firm, then flat. Factories released a lot of stock, and sales on this street were active, with robust trading. Soybean oil initially traded at 750 yuan, closing at 730 yuan, up 10 yuan. Rapeseed oil closed at 620 yuan, also up 10 yuan. Raw oil was scarce, with unrefined oil in barrels opening at 880 yuan, up 40 yuan. Small cart sesame oil alone was flat. Soybean cake had no demand from merchant groups, down 6 or 7 yuan.

### Sugar Market Rebounds Once

The sugar market saw a rebound after a period of declines, boosting confidence among industry insiders. The market saw looser credit conditions. The situation is becoming more stable, rumors have subsided, and merchant groups are expanding their orders, leading to a more promising market.

No. 45 White Refined Sugar closed at 365 yuan, up 10 yuan from last Saturday. Medium sugar showed a stronger trend, up 15 yuan. Coarse sugar experienced a soft market due to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation's distribution yesterday, saturating merchant demand, leading to continuous selling and price declines.

Yesterday, the factory's rock sugar was severely depressed last Saturday. Yesterday, demand increased from all merchant groups, boosting confidence, and the market price rose by 60 yuan. Zhenji brand crystal sugar also showed a gain of 20 yuan.

### Ministry of Industry and Commerce Appoints Du Junai as Exchange Supervisor

[Report from this Newspaper] The new supervisor of the Securities Exchange in this city, Du Junai, appointed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, took office at the Securities Exchange Supervisor's Office yesterday morning. The original supervisor, Shen Yunlong, was previously impeached by the Control Yuan and has been suspended from his duties. Furthermore, Wang Bietang, the supervisor appointed by the Ministry of Finance, resigned before the impeachment by the Control Yuan. The vacancy is temporarily filled by Wang Chuanfu, the secretary of the Supervisor's Office appointed by the ministry.

It is also learned that Du Junai previously served as the director of the Tianjin Office of the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee and as a supervisor of the Tianjin Securities Exchange.

### Credit Conditions Continue to Ease, Restrictions on Cash Withdrawals Lifted

Credit conditions continue to ease, informal interest rates are declining. Daily interest on every thousand yuan is 20 to 25 yuan, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 6 to 7.5 cents. Cash reserves are slightly more abundant, and several banks have lifted restrictions on cash withdrawals, or relaxed them from 1,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan per household.

### Tea Market Continues Weak

Since the tea market began its decline last week, the sluggish trend continued yesterday, as those needing to raise cash by selling off their positions continued to emerge. As a result, buyers aggressively cut prices again, leading to significant declines. However, according to general opinion, the prospects are still viewed favorably, but demand has not been satisfactory, leading to a lack of activity. Overall, the foundation is still difficult to stabilize, with a regrettable trend towards instability.

### Stagnation in Fur Exports

Despite the continued strength in foreign exchange transfer certificates, exports of wool and sheepskin remain sluggish due to weak overseas prices and declining demand, leading to a lack of trading activity in Shanghai. The quoted price for Huzhou wool is reportedly as high as 30 US dollars per picul, but after deducting 20% for foreign payments, it only amounts to 960 yuan at a transfer certificate rate of 40 yuan, while the current net purchase price in the area is 1,200 yuan per picul. Additionally, the overseas selling price of Huzhou sheepskin is only 1.2 to 1.3 yuan per piece, barely enough to cover the purchase of raw fur materials, so both exports currently have little hope.

### Jiangsu Education Overture: Mr. Hong Junpei Plans Implementation

[Report from this Newspaper, Yixing, 4th] Since taking office as the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, Mr. Hong Junpei has shown a strong commitment to revitalizing education in Jiangsu. Recently, he drafted a detailed plan and, to facilitate its implementation, personally visited the Jiangnan region to conduct on-site inspections, assess the actual situation, and gather information for the design.

Upon returning to his hometown of Yixing, he did not attend to family matters or local socializing, but instead rushed to inspect the current state of education. In the midst of his busy schedule, he spared an evening to speak at length with reporters. Director Hong stated straightforwardly that the slow progress of China is largely due to the lack of universal education. Currently, the average illiteracy rate on the mainland is 80%, which is the biggest obstacle to all policy implementation. He does not dare to claim excessive ambition for Jiangsu's education, but only intends to start by eliminating illiteracy in Jiangsu, hoping to quickly increase the knowledge rate, which is the achievement he seeks. The plan sets Shanghai County as a new education demonstration county, and demonstration zones will be established in all other counties throughout the province. This is because Shanghai County has a small area, a high level of culture, and local wealth, making it convenient to implement a comprehensive new system. Each county will consider the actual situation and delineate demonstration areas, implementing the new education system within the designated areas. This new facility has two goals: (1) to popularize national education, strictly limiting all school-age children in the area and forcing them to attend school, while relaxing the scale of free and scholarship loans to 80%; (2) to promote adult literacy, in coordination with township household registration, conducting door-to-door surveys of illiteracy and enforcing literacy until everyone can read and write letters. It is expected that Shanghai County will complete its tasks within one year, and each county will complete its tasks within one and a half years. It is stipulated that after the first demonstration area in Jiangnan counties is completed, an appropriate area will be selected, and all educational personnel will be moved to the second area to continue the promotion, in order to progressively complete the county. He believes he has the determination to carry it out resolutely. Within three years, Jiangsu can eliminate illiteracy, and at that time, Jiangsu Province will naturally become a national education demonstration province. He is borrowing from the example of Ding County in Hebei, which had completed 80% of its work before the war, and whose administrative efficiency was temporarily the best in the province and county. He does not hesitate to personally go to each county to instruct on the implementation methods, requiring each county education bureau to collect the drafted implementation plans by the end of this year and actively implement them simultaneously next year. This is the central task of the Department of Education at present. He stated very straightforwardly that he has no grand governance plans.

Finally, we talked about education in Yixing. He said that although it has been hit by the war, in its present state, it is not weaker than other counties, a point he considers a great comfort. The quality of education in Jiangnan is uneven, especially in this county. For his contribution to his hometown, he will establish a radio station in the city in the shortest possible time to instill scientific knowledge and current affairs common sense, and purchase chemical instruments to enrich experimental content. Finally, when the reporter asked him to express his opinion on the teachers' strike, he said that this was a problem that could not be solved by treating the symptoms, and he could only appeal to the teachers morally, saying: "A war is a difficult time for the rear. If we don't grit our teeth, we will be eliminated by this transformation." Therefore, he indicated that he would recently request the Ministry of Education to expedite the resolution of the problems faced by Haidai Middle School to prevent future problems.

The new overture to Jiangsu education is opening day by day, and we will wait and see.

### Feng Zikai in Xiamen Mourns Master Hongyi, Plans to Search for Calligraphy in Southern Fujian

[Report from this Newspaper, Xiamen, 2nd Airmail] Feng Zikai went to Taiwan for more than a month, enjoying the famous scenic spots on the island. After holding a public painting exhibition in the Zhongshan Hall Gallery in Taipei last month, he took a short break, packed his luggage, and left Taiwan for Xiamen on the "Lujiang" steamer on November 23rd with his daughter, Yiyin.

Visited Putuo to Visit the Tomb, Gave a Speech at Shoushan Rock

Upon arriving in Xiamen, he went to Nanputuo to visit Dharma Master Guangqia and mourn Master Hongyi's tomb and relics. He was then invited by the Buddhist Association to give a lecture at Shoushan Rock in Xiamen on the 28th of last month. The number of attendees that day was very crowded. Before the lecture, the front and back of Shoushan Rock were already full of people, bustling and crowded, the sound like the great bell of a mountain temple, overflowing all around. When the colleagues of the Buddhist Association accompanied Mr. Feng to the stage, it was immediately as quiet as a graveyard, with people craning their necks and straining their eyes, vying to see Mr. Feng's demeanor. The lecture began with a brief introduction by the person in charge of the Buddhist Association, followed by Mr. Feng taking the stage, without any pleasantries, immediately proposing the topic of the lecture: "Master Hongyi and I," and then speaking eloquently:

Three Realms of Life: Comparing Them to Houses

"...Human life can be divided into three types: the first is called material life, the second is spiritual life, and the third is soul life. Let's compare these three realms of life to houses: material life is the first floor. People are bustling and vying for nothing more than abundant food, clothing, housing, and property. Its meaning is extremely narrow, and life is extremely short. Therefore, people with ideals and knowledge often want to step upstairs to seek spiritual life, such as studying science, literature, philosophy, art, etc., to enrich the meaning of their lives and expand the scope of human service. And this kind of development reaches its highest realm, which is the so-called 'poetry reaches its subtlety without a single word, painting reaches its spirit without a single brushstroke.' Because the universe is vast, and things are complicated, any science, literature, philosophy, art, cannot contain a person's pure soul, which can transcend all boundaries, so Master Hongyi's art has reached its highest realm, and he must go up another floor, become a monk and study Buddhism, which is inevitable..."

Unable to Become a Monk with His Teacher: Considers It a Lifelong Regret

"...I am still lingering on the second floor today, unable to become a monk with my teacher and climb to the highest peak, which is a great regret!"

After a slight pause, taking a sip of tea, he emphasized the message that "moral character is more important than writing and art," and encouraged the audience to pay attention to this.

Mr. Feng will be staying in Xiamen for a month, first to thank friends from all parties, and has decided to hold a painting exhibition for three consecutive days on December 3rd, 4th, and 5th. Afterwards, he plans to travel to southern Fujian to visit scenic spots and collect Master Hongyi's calligraphy. (Bai Zhen)

### Jiangnan Grain Merchants Go to Northern Jiangsu to Purchase Food: Measures Determined

[Report from this Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 3rd] The Jiangsu Provincial Government has recently established eight measures to assist Jiangnan grain merchants in purchasing in northern Jiangsu. The main points are: (1) Jiangnan counties should immediately coordinate the quantity of food needed to be purchased in the county for at least three months and report it to the provincial government for assistance in purchasing; (2) In addition to assisting in purchasing, the county governments of northern Jiangsu should also supervise farmers and grain households in the area to sell surplus grain at local market prices; (3) The provincial government will forward the telegram to the First Pacification Zone Administrative Office, instructing all material control stations along the route to verify and release the approved food purchases; (4) Except for the temporary pacification subsidy fees explicitly stipulated by the First Pacification Zone, local governments, military police teams, shall not arbitrarily impose any taxes; (5) Except for the verification by the material control stations in the First Pacification Zone, other agencies shall not obstruct or hinder; (6) In addition to the funds raised by the grain merchants themselves, if there is a shortage, the provincial government can request the Ministry of Food to provide food loans.

### Smuggling Materials, Bribing Went Wrong

Fang Aqing and Others Detained in Cheng

[Report from this Newspaper, Jiangyin, 4th] Chen Kelin, a native of Jiangbei Xingang, opened a peanut shop west of Pu Hui Bridge in Beiwai. He and his fellow villagers Pan Jincai, Wang Jinquan, Wang Mao, Fang Abing, etc., purchased 353 cans of kerosene, daily necessities such as matches, soap, cigarettes, cloth, etc., and hired Fang Aqing's civilian boat, planning to transport them out of the port at the dead of night on the 2nd, to deliver the goods to Xingang. He first bribed Wu Tingtai, the squad leader of the Huangtian Port Inspection Station, with 3,000 Gold Yuan, requesting clearance. Wu refused, secretly reported to Director Chen Zhen, and detained the boat, capturing the cargo owner and boatmen Fang Aqing, Huang Wenxiang, and others, totaling five people, who were sent to the Fortress Command for questioning on the 3rd.

### Wounded Soldiers Transported to Hang County: Local Gentry Urge Evacuation

[Report from this Newspaper, Hang County, 5th] In recent days, many wounded soldiers have been transported to Hang County. As the authorities have ordered them to be settled outside the city, they are scattered in large numbers throughout the towns and villages of this county. It is said that there are already 2,000 people in Linping Town, and as many as 3,000 to 4,000 people in Tangqi Town, each accounting for more than one-third of the total population. Although the order is still good, the accommodation is a major problem, so many have borrowed civilian houses to live in. It is heard that the gentry of the two places plan to request the authorities to consider evacuating them to other counties and towns to balance the burden.

### President Xu Peikun Discusses the Overall Situation in North China: Basically Stable

[Report from this Newspaper] Regarding the general situation in North China, we recently received detailed information from President Xu Peikun of the Beijing Railway Management College. He said that the security in Beijing and Tianjin is actually more peaceful than in any other city in the country. Although the Pingjin Railway line is constantly attacked and damaged by the Communist army, since Commander-in-Chief Fu took charge of the Suppression Headquarters, traffic on the line has never been interrupted. In the battlefields throughout North China, after the Communist army was suppressed by Commander-in-Chief Fu's soldiers, they all retreated in defeat. Recently, the national army guarding the various passes, such as Qinyu, has been withdrawn. Geographically speaking, the Communist army seems to be able to take the opportunity to enter the pass in a continuous stream and attack Beijing and Tianjin, but General Fu will surely be able to win by surprise and stabilize the overall situation. Moreover, Commander-in-Chief Fu not only has a way to manage the military, but also has profound research on political and economic facilities, and can take effective measures. During the price restriction period, there were quite a few disturbances in the Beijing and Shanghai areas, but the markets in Beijing and Tianjin were extremely stable and traded as usual. According to President Xu, he deeply knows the greatness of Commander-in-Chief Fu and is comparable to America's Eisenhower and Britain's Montgomery.

Mr. Xu did not say that, according to his observation of the situation in schools in various places, whether large, medium, or small, all levels of schools must strive to cultivate national integrity and revive civic morality, so that the basic thinking of our nation can be tightened, and then adjust to the absorption of Western culture. Otherwise, if we let schools become factories for creating new slogans, or be reduced to political battlefields, or only be tools for imparting technical knowledge, we will inevitably abandon the fundamentals and pursue the superficial, making school education a political stage or a lifeless technical training center, and education will lose its important meaning.

### Small News Items

Jiangyin

[Report from this Newspaper] The Beijing-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters believes that the coastal defense of each county along the Yangtze River is important and that surveillance posts should be established. Every kilometer in each coastal town and village should have one, and 25 eligible men should be drawn to monitor day and night, to be completed within ten days.

### Letter from Family Members of Passengers Who Perished in the Jiangya Ship Disaster

...Expressing Deep Dissatisfaction with China Merchants Steam Navigation Company...

To the editor of the Shen Bao service column: The Jiangya ship on the Shanghai-Ningbo line recently sank after an explosion not far from the mouth of the Wusong River. More than 3,000 passengers were on board, and very few were rescued. Although reports say nearly a thousand, the list announced by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has only about 600 people. Some passengers had their entire families buried at sea, and some had only one survivor from three generations of their family. The tragedy is unbearable to hear! And the grief of the family members of the deceased is even more imaginable. The reader is one of the family members of the deceased. His elderly mother, weak younger sister, and sister-in-law and nephew, a total of four people, suffered this tragic change, and his heart is extremely grieved! In the past two days, he has been running around between China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, various docks, and various hospitals, and he always feels that China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is handling such a major tragedy as if human life is child's play, which is really incomprehensible! The issue of responsibility can be discussed later before the cause of the accident is clarified, but since the incident has occurred, the company should quickly seize the opportunity to deal with the aftermath. Of course, major matters cannot be properly resolved immediately, but the company should sincerely respond to the concerns of the families of the deceased who are eager to know. However, the reader went to the company several times and did not see any notices. It was not until evening that a small list of survivors was posted outside the ticket office. After dark, the viewers still gathered, using flashlights or cigarette butts to look at the list, and the company just posted it and left it at that. At the docks, the families of the deceased were running around to find out information, but there were no dedicated people at the docks to take care of contact information, provide information, and the company was indifferent to the anxious emotions of the families of the deceased! Taking the small to illustrate the big, it is heartbreaking! According to the newspaper, the passenger limit of the Jiangya ship was 2,256 people, but the ship carried more than 3,000 passengers that day. Although it is said that the ticket sales did not exceed the limit, where did the "scalpers" come from? Why didn't the company pay attention to it! Although this accident was not directly caused by this, why didn't the company consider the safety issue of overloading? If the number of passengers were in accordance with the regulations, wouldn't the number of deaths have been reduced by hundreds of people? China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the largest shipping company in our country, but the preparation has reached this point. Your newspaper holds the bullwhip of the journalistic world, and I would like to ask you to disclose this so that the company knows to be vigilant, and then the safety of passengers can be guaranteed, which is very fortunate! Please accept my best regards. Reader Zhou Da Jin on December 5th.

### Communism in China September 1948 U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs Compilation

— Translated by Ding Lite, This Newspaper

The Communist Party of the United States was the first to recognize China's strategic importance. William Z. Foster, in a statement to the National Committee of the Communist Party, stated:

"Internationally, the main task is to prevent the United States from interfering in Chinese affairs. ...The war in China is the key to solving all international problems, and it is here that we must inflict the greatest blow on the reactionary forces. ...Regarding the China issue, to which we are wholly devoted, we must convene five hundred meetings across the country, mobilizing the full strength of all the people we can reach, to prevent intervention in China."

We have pointed out earlier that China is the testing ground for communism in all industrially backward countries. It serves the same purpose for free enterprise and the democratic world.

This obvious situation is sometimes obscured by the view that "China's vast territory cannot be conquered by communism." This view assumes that China will swallow and digest communism as easily as it swallowed its Mongol and Manchu conquerors in the past. Such a view of history is indeed superficial. The Mongol and Manchu conquerors certainly had military organization and tactics, but they lacked economic systems, political systems, and modern administrative and technical knowledge.

Today's CCP has a larger trained cadre than Soviet Russia in 1917. The Bolshevik Party of Soviet Russia not only seized power but also used it to strengthen the country. It had to educate nearly four-fifths of the illiterate population, enabling them to read propaganda and learn new professions. The Bolshevik Party was able to use brutal methods to achieve its goals. In the early days of communism, Soviet Russia was not as strong as Britain or Germany. But judging by the performance in World War II, the strength of the Soviet Union was almost comparable to any other country. By then, communism had taken root in the Soviet Union and could not be shaken. We have no reason to conclude that the Communist Party will not achieve the same in China. Communism does not fail to control a country simply because it cannot solve temporary economic difficulties. Once a country falls into the hands of the Communist Party, it is not easy to retreat.

B. The China Problem

Simply put, the China problem is: How can China become a strong and democratic country, sharing a part of the responsibility for a peaceful world? This does not mean the Americanization of China, nor does it mean the Reddening of China, but rather the modernization of China. Moreover, it is necessary to eliminate political and military chaos, eliminate economic poverty and disasters, eliminate closed customs, and eliminate opacity of political power. Finally, true democracy must be practiced, and China must not be dominated by any force below a world government, but must maintain a great and humane society.

To interpret the China problem in this way may seem impractical and idealistic, unspecific and too abstract. We must restate it in more practical terms; to do so, we must divide the problem into several smaller problems, such as industrial problems, agricultural problems, economic problems, domestic problems, foreign affairs problems, social problems, administrative problems, and democratic problems. At the same time, we must consider the methods that can be used to address each problem, these methods representing China's own capabilities, the capabilities of the Communist Party, and the capabilities of the United States. These many problems are interrelated, and the proper solution to one problem is related to the solution of other problems. Even if we describe them separately, they are still part of the whole problem.

The problem of increasing population can be solved by the establishment of modern industrial civilization, and there is no other way. This can raise the level of agricultural and industrial production to feed the people and improve their living standards. The establishment of modern industrial civilization can ultimately lead to a decline in the fertility rate, which prevents population growth. However, when modern civilization is first introduced, the population growth rate is the fastest, reducing the mortality rate before reducing the fertility rate. This once caused a surge in the population of Europe in the nineteenth century, and is now affecting other regions, such as China. But it has its own remedies. People's lifespans increase, and the age distribution of the population changes accordingly, and eventually the mortality rate maintains a normal relationship with the population. Communism has not provided a practical way to solve this problem, and it has never had the opportunity to address this problem in the Soviet Union. It values soldiers who are sent to their deaths by artillery too much, and neglects solutions that improve human life. It values future war potential too much, and does not use industrial products to promote human welfare. Only modern industries that are exclusively for daily use and not for war can protect China's growing population. This is the basis of the industrial problem.

China's industrial problem is the problem of importing modern industrial technology and modern industrial products. China needs more telephones, more refrigerators, more radios, more clothes, and more houses. In the simplest terms, China must raise living standards, and to raise living standards, it must seek ways to increase the productivity of Chinese workers. The basic element for increasing productivity is to increase the application of physical force.

China can use its domestic resources to meet the urgent needs of industrial progress. To obtain energy and power, China has large coal mines and great hope for hydropower development. It has huge manpower that can undertake the great projects of the past, such as the Long River and Yellow River embankments, as well as recent projects such as the construction of mountain roads and the Chengdu airport during the war. It needs engineers, but not as many as people imagine, because Chinese handicrafts are particularly exquisite and developed. In the early stage of industrial development in China, most of it is small-scale, and labor, skills, and power resources are readily available. If the economic situation stabilizes, industrial and economic development can at least restore or even exceed the prosperity of China in the past.

To surpass China's past prosperity, there must be real improvements. Not only do power application methods need to be improved, but China's transportation situation also needs to be thoroughly improved. This means that China needs more railways, better highways, more freight cars and buses, and better waterway transportation. Although China's railways do not need to be as developed as those in the United States, China needs at least twice as many railways as it currently has, or even more.

All this construction requires steel, and from China's resources, steel is the most hopeless raw material among all its needs. It seems that there is little hope for China to have the same amount of steel as the United States. But that does not prevent it from greatly increasing from its current quantity. However, all the steel needed in Asia depends on the stability of the economic situation in Northeast China and Indonesia, and the revival of Japan. This is a long-term plan. If China restores its normal and sound economic situation, China will be able to produce or purchase several times more steel than in the past.

The agricultural problem is mainly the food production problem, which is no less important than the industrial problem. Chinese agriculture, during times of national peace, is able to meet the food needs of the whole country. However, due to the uneven distribution of national production, the surplus in one place is used to make up for the deficiency in another place due to lack of transportation or political instability, resulting in the inability to fully utilize the products and distribute them to the national market.

Chinese agriculture will not be able to catch up with the scale of American agriculture in the near future. The average food production of each Chinese farmer is about 3,000 pounds per year, while the average production of American farmers is about 44,000 pounds per year, which illustrates the striking difference in agricultural development between China and the United States. Furthermore, for hundreds of years, the Chinese have maintained the fertility of good land. This simple fact indicates that China has its own land fertilization methods, which cannot be immediately improved with Western fertilizers. But the West can offer China excellent seeds and plant varieties, insecticides and fungicides, and refrigeration methods.

The war has hindered the progress of the agricultural problem and left behind a bad political legacy. In the past ten years, the Chinese Kuomintang and the landlord class have been too close, and too distant from the farmers. They have left behind a weak and incompetent institution in all aspects, especially a weak and incompetent transportation system. They have further undermined the economic stability necessary for agriculture and commerce.

However, before the general economic difficulties in China are resolved, the industrial and agricultural problems in China cannot make any progress. Since the outbreak of the war, currency inflation has increased day by day, almost all long-term orders from merchants have been stopped, and farmers' agricultural products cannot be fairly exchanged for other things. Recently, the National Government tried to implement a general monetary reform, which was announced on August 19. As for the hope of success, it is still unclear at the moment.

Behind currency inflation lies the turbulence of civil war and international war. Since 1931, the Chinese economy has lost the function of a national economy. This means that domestic production development has been hindered, or even completely stagnated. China's local self-sufficiency is noteworthy, but if the free trade zone is not stable, the general level cannot be greatly improved.

To solve China's economic problems, the domestic political problems must be solved first.

The first requirement is a stable national government that can control the whole country. This is the only way to eliminate the danger of civil war and currency inflation. The second requirement is to obtain immediate material assistance, such as food needed by the cities, manufactured products such as small motors and machines that meet the needs of the Chinese, and cotton needed by the Chinese textile industry. This is essential to stabilize the currency. Assuming that the civil war ends and all other problems are solved, China can survive even without material assistance. This summer's floods have created a special problem of food panic. Neither the Chinese government nor the CCP can meet these needs. The United States can at least meet these needs to a considerable extent, but there must be political stability first.

This leads to the military problem, the problem of victory in the civil war. Since the Soviet Union occupied Northeast China, the Communist Party's ability in the civil war has obviously greatly increased. At present, China obviously cannot mobilize all its capabilities to quickly defeat the CCP and establish a non-communist country. However, it may be possible if it gets a little military assistance and advisors, and this is also very clear. The United States can probably supply everything China needs, because most of the equipment China needs is simple and low-grade, requiring only rifles and not tanks, only white shells and not flamethrowers.

Low cost and high mobility are the two most important characteristics of the Chinese civil war. The equipment currently available to the Chinese army is more modern than it was ten years ago, but still falls short of what is needed for a formal war against Japan. If the American equipment and training ideas are forcibly instilled into Chinese military operations, it is likely to turn the Chinese army from a walking team into an army bound by railway transportation. Equipment and training must be coordinated with the actual war to overcome the enemy, which is effective assistance.

There is another aspect to the political problem. What has been discussed above is only a domestic problem. But no country can have sufficient commercial credit unless its international status is stable, and domestic stability alone is not enough. Any country that is subject to foreign interference or aggression can never have sufficient commercial credit.

The stability of a country's international status is nothing more than the result of its own strong power. In recent centuries, only a few leading European countries and the United States have had this strong power. Until recently, the British Dominions have always relied on the unshakable power of Britain itself. (To be continued)
