[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 13th] After the currency system reform, the methods related to foreign exchange review, application for purchase, and payment will be revised. The Executive Yuan has designated the Ministry of Finance to invite relevant units to discuss the integration and drafting of these new methods. At around 10:00 AM on the 13th, the Monetary Department of the Ministry of Finance specially convened a meeting with representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education, the Import and Export Control Committee, the Central Bank, and the Executive Yuan. Present were Director-General Mai Shijun of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education, Director-General Chen Yingjing of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Section Chief Zhu Jingyi of the Executive Yuan, among others. The meeting was presided over by Director of the Monetary Department Bu Fuzhou. During the discussion, the Ministry of Finance presented a draft of the "Measures for Applying for Purchase and Payment of Foreign Exchange," which served as the basis for discussion. After exchanging opinions, it was agreed that the measures should be re-drafted. It was also decided that the relevant units should first submit written opinions to the Ministry of Finance for collation, and then present them for discussion at the next meeting. The main points of the draft measures proposed by the Ministry of Finance are as follows: (1) Applications for purchasing or paying foreign currency or foreign exchange deposits should be submitted on an application form stating the nature of the need. (2) If an agency imports goods, it must obtain an import permit from the Import and Export Control Committee of the Executive Yuan.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 13th] The compilation and review methods for the central government's general budget for the 38th year were drafted by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and passed by the Executive Yuan on the 13th. They will be distributed to the various agencies for compilation within the prescribed time limit. According to the Constitution, the central government's general budget should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review three months before the beginning of the fiscal year. However, because the budget for the 37th year was compiled in two parts, for the first and second halves of the year, and the second half of the year coincided with the currency system reform, the time was delayed. The compilation and review of the budget for the 38th year has also been delayed. It is reported that the general budget compilation and review methods passed by the Executive Yuan on the 13th still stipulate the separate compilation of general and special budgets, and detailed deadlines are set for the compilation and review of budgets at all levels. The methods stipulate that the primary and secondary competent authorities should formulate policy plans based on the policy guidelines passed by the Executive Yuan at its previous meeting and compile rough estimates. The revenue budget should be sent to the Ministry of Finance, and the expenditure budget should be sent to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, all to be submitted before October 31st of this year. The state-owned enterprises (state-owned financial, transportation, public utility, trade, industrial, and mining enterprises) under the secondary competent authorities shall separately compile business plans and business rough estimates and submit them to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics before October 31st. The number of official interest and dividends that can be settled for each business full year is compiled into a revenue rough estimate and submitted to the Ministry of Finance at the same time. The Ministry of Finance, upon receiving the revenue rough estimates from the various agencies, shall compile a revenue general rough estimate and submit it to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics before November 5th. The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, based on the expenditure rough estimates from the various agencies and the revenue general rough estimate compiled by the Ministry of Finance, shall review them and compile the general budget proposal and special budget proposal and submit them to the Executive Yuan before November 20th. After discussion and approval by the Executive Yuan, they shall be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review together with the policy guidelines and policy plans before November 30th. The compilation and review methods also contain detailed regulations regarding the preparation of the budget. The important ones are: (1) Except for those that are tightened or expanded in accordance with the policy plan, the recurring expenses of each agency shall be based on the sum of the original budget for the second half of the 37th year and its increased part. Salaries and public funds shall be calculated separately based on the number of approved personnel and the prescribed standards for the second half of the 37th year. (2) The temporary expenses of each agency shall be assessed and listed based on actual needs. Unnecessary expenditures shall not be included. (3) The operating expenses of each agency shall be compiled in accordance with the approved plan. Projects that cannot be effective in the short term shall be postponed.

### Legislative Yuan's Budget, Finance Committees Discuss Improving Public Education Treatment: Committee Members, Proposers to Research, Draft Specific Measures

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 13th] The Legislative Yuan's Budget and Finance Committees held a joint meeting on the morning of the 13th to review the proposals related to improving the treatment of public education personnel by Jin Shaoxian et al., Yu Lingyun et al., and Xie Chengyu et al. It was decided that each committee should appoint five members to conduct detailed research with the original proposers, draft specific measures, and then submit them to the joint meeting for discussion. The committee members had no objection to the principle of reforming the treatment of public education personnel. However, some believed that adjusting the treatment of public education personnel at the present time would further stimulate the market and affect the effectiveness of economic management. Others advocated that after deciding on the principle of improvement, the Executive Yuan should research and draft measures and consult the Legislative Yuan for review. Regarding the issue of financial resources, the majority of the committee members believed that if the government effectively implemented the budget, the expenditure for improving the treatment of public education personnel would not necessarily require increasing currency issuance. Measures such as canceling grain rations in the six major cities, selling enemy-puppet and traitorous property, using US aid materials, levying temporary property taxes, liquidating the capital of wealthy families, postponing debt repayment, and controlling the profits of state-owned enterprises should be actively promoted to broaden the state treasury income, save unnecessary expenses, and use it to improve the treatment of public education personnel.

### Sale of Enemy-Puppet Real Estate: Strive for Fair Valuation

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 13th] The Economic and Resources Committee of the Legislative Yuan met in the afternoon of the 13th to hear the report of He Haoruo, chairman of the Executive Yuan's Enemy-Puppet Property Handling Committee. He explained five points: (1) Enemy-puppet real estate will be sold at a variable price. If the original occupants do not prepare funds to purchase the property within fifteen days, it will be publicly auctioned. Garden villas inhabited by high-ranking officials and wealthy people will not be let off easily. However, for alley houses inhabited by general public education personnel, their economic capabilities will be considered. If they cannot prepare the price themselves, efforts will still be made to maintain their priority rental rights. (2) Real estate used by government agencies and state-owned enterprises as offices, dormitories, or factories may be transferred. (3) The property of traitors will be dealt with after their crimes have been finally adjudicated. The residences of Mayor Wu of Shanghai and Bei Zuyi are all traitorous properties that have not yet been finally adjudicated. (4) The reason why the property of German僑民 has not been dealt with is that a question of direct warfare and indirect warfare once arose in the previous conference on German reparations. China has not suffered direct damage from Germany. If we directly confiscate the property of its nationals, it may cause international criticism. (5) The total income from enemy-puppet property that has been processed in the past is 931.48 billion Legal Tender, of which about one-twentieth, or 459.6 billion Legal Tender, was transferred for relief. This figure cannot be converted into gold yuan because the time of income varies. The estimated future income is about 33.274 million gold yuan.

### National Defense Ministry Organizational Law: Joint Review Underway

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 13th] The National Defense Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a closed meeting on the morning of the 13th to continue discussing the National Defense Ministry Organizational Law. It was decided to appoint Yu Zheng, Yan Xunfu, Wang Jun, Jiang Gongliang, Chen Jiesheng, Wang Demin, Xue Jinyu and other seven members to consult the opinions expressed by the various members and jointly conduct a review with the members selected by the Legislative Committee.

### Monthly Salary and Public Expense Payment Methods for the President, Vice President, and Appointed and Special Appointed Personnel: The Examination Yuan Drafts a Proposal to Report to the Legislative Yuan Tomorrow

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 13th] The monthly salary and public expense payment methods for the President, Vice President, and appointed and specially appointed personnel have been drafted into draft regulations by the Examination Yuan after detailed research and consultation with the Executive Yuan. They are proposed to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review and have been included in the reporting matters section of the 11th meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan on the 15th. The draft regulations have a total of five articles. According to the monthly salary and public expense figures set in them, the President can earn 1724 gold yuan coupons per month, the Vice President 924 yuan, the heads of the Executive, Judicial, and Examination Yuans 444 yuan, the vice heads 364 yuan, and the heads of the ministries and commissions appointed by other special appointments and the secretaries-general of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans and the Director of the Information Bureau 284 yuan. The full text of the provisional regulations on the monthly salary and public expense payment for the President and appointed and specially appointed officials is recorded below: Article 1: The monthly salary and public expenses of the President shall each be set at 8,000 yuan. The monthly salary and public expenses of the Vice President shall each be set at 4,000 yuan (Explanation: There are currently no regulations on the monthly salary of the President and Vice President. The annual salary of the US President is 75,000 yuan, and the annual salary of the Vice President and Secretary of State is 15,000 yuan, one-fifth of the President's annual salary. The various situations in our country are different. It is now proposed that the monthly salary of appointed and specially appointed personnel be 800 yuan, so the President's monthly salary is proposed to be listed at ten times 800 yuan, and the Vice President's monthly salary is proposed to be halved according to the President's monthly salary. As for the public expenses, the President's provisional list for July was 200 million yuan, and the Vice President's provisional list was 100 million yuan, which is far from the actual needs, so it is also proposed to list it according to the amount of the monthly salary).

Article 2: The monthly salary of appointed personnel is set at 800 yuan, the public expenses of the heads of the Executive Yuan, Judicial Yuan, and Examination Yuan are set at 2,400 yuan, the public expenses of the vice heads of the Judicial Yuan and Examination Yuan are set at 1,600 yuan, and the public expenses of other appointed personnel are set at 800 yuan (Explanation: The responsibilities of appointed and specially appointed personnel are originally different, but they are all political officials. Setting tiered regulations will hinder rather than help, so the monthly salary of elected and specially appointed officials set by the National Government during the period of political tutelage is uniformly set at 800 yuan. However, the public expenses are 800 yuan for general appointed and specially appointed personnel, doubled for the vice heads, and doubled again for the heads).

Article 3: The monthly salary and public expenses of specially appointed personnel are each set at 800 yuan, and the public expenses of the Vice President of the Executive Yuan are set at 1,600 yuan.

The monthly salary and public expenses of personnel specially appointed by the organizational law are determined by reference to the regulations for specially appointed personnel (Explanation: The current organizational law has secretaries-general of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans, the Director of the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan, etc. In the future, there may be more as needed, but it is limited to those specified by the organizational law to avoid abuse).

Article 4: The monthly salary and public expenses stipulated in this regulation shall be paid in gold yuan according to the current standard of discounting the salaries of civil servants (Explanation: Before the promulgation of the new salary system, the salaries of civil servants are still based on Legal Tender for calculation, so the figures stipulated in this regulation are still based on the old system. The current standard for civil servants to discount the salary of gold yuan is that each yuan within 40 yuan is actually issued in gold yuan, 20% is discounted for 41 yuan to 300 yuan, and 10% is discounted for 301 yuan and above. The monthly salary and public expenses stipulated in this regulation are of course appropriate. If there is any change in the future discounting standard, it will be handled accordingly).

Article 5: This regulation shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

Editorial

### Trends in the Japanese Political Situation

The special session of the Japanese Diet convened on the 11th of this month. This special session faces the resignation en masse of the Ashida Cabinet, and its main task is to elect a new prime minister and revise the "National Public Service Law." According to Article 67 of the Japanese Constitution, the Prime Minister is designated by the Diet from among its members. According to custom, the candidates for Prime Minister must first be consulted outside the Diet, and then proposed by the majority party to avoid fluctuations in the Diet. After the Ashida Cabinet announced its resignation en masse on the 7th, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Komakichi Matsuoka, visited Shigeru Yoshida, President of the Democratic Liberal Party, on the 8th to inquire about his views on forming a new cabinet. He also visited the leaders of the Socialist Party, the National Cooperative Party, the Democratic Party, and the Socialist Reform Party to promote a five-party leaders' meeting to exchange views on the formation of a coalition government. The Democratic Liberal Party initially adopted a rejecting attitude towards the five-party leaders' meeting, but later agreed to hold it in Speaker Matsuoka's office in the House of Representatives on the morning of the 10th. Judging from the general situation, there is little doubt that Shigeru Yoshida, President of the Democratic Liberal Party, will come forward to lead the formation of a cabinet. The problem currently facing him is whether to form a coalition government or a one-party government. This question concerning the form of government is of great importance to the future political trends in Japan and deserves our deep attention.

The collapse of the Ashida Cabinet was an inevitable fact. Seven months ago, when Ashida appeared in the guise of a "new opening of an old shop" of the previous Katayama Cabinet, this newspaper predicted in its editorial that the Ashida Cabinet would still be a short-lived cabinet, paving the way for Shigeru Yoshida. Since Takeo Kurisu, the Minister of Economic Stabilization in the previous Katayama Cabinet and then in the Ashida Cabinet, was detained in September due to a corruption case, the cabinet has faced a major crisis. This newspaper pointed out in its editorial on October 6 that the credibility of the Japanese government has declined, the government and political parties have separated, and the fate of the Ashida Cabinet hangs in the balance. As we expected, the Ashida Cabinet announced its resignation en masse on the 7th, citing the reason: "It is regrettable that Minister Kurisu has been summoned and tried for his involvement in the Showa Denko incident. As the head of the cabinet, I feel a moral responsibility and have decided to resign from the position of Prime Minister." Ashida fell in this dishonorable atmosphere, like a faded rose, losing its brilliance and splendor. It is believed that such a politician, praised by the Allied forces as one who has fully democratized Japan, will never be able to recover from such a ruthless fall in his life.

Ashida's downfall was not the wish of Ashida or the Democratic Party. But politics is ruthless. Ashida was forced to step down due to various circumstances, and it was an ignominious fall. One of the reasons is that the Kurisu corruption case involved a wide range of people, including former Deputy Prime Minister Suehiro Nishio, Setsuzo Hinohara, President of Showa Denko, Senichiro Ozawa, head of the Preparatory Committee for the Formation of the New Liberal Constitution, Sato, head of Mitsui Heavy Industries, Ito, Warden of Tokyo Prison, and Ono, industrial leader of the Democratic Liberal Party, who have been successively detained. The incumbent Okurasho Kitamura may also be detained soon, resulting in the loss of face for the government and the most shameful case of suspected corruption since the Meiji and Taisho eras. According to Nishio's confession in court on the 7th, Prime Minister Ashida was involved in the theft of two million US dollars of public funds, leaving Ashida speechless and unable to cope with the crisis, and had to announce his resignation to await the resolution of the court. The second reason is that the Socialist Party and the National Cooperative Party formally announced the withdrawal of their support for the cabinet and unanimously demanded that Ashida resign en masse to apologize to the people. If Ashida clings to his post and loses his political and moral responsibility, the Socialist Party will withdraw from the six ministries of the cabinet. Ashida was thus isolated and had to leave. The third reason is that the Allied forces did not provide support. MacArthur has always adopted an interventionist attitude towards the political turmoil in Japan. The two cabinets of Yoshida and Katayama collapsed under his interference. This time, MacArthur suddenly adopted a "hands-off" policy towards the Ashida Cabinet's predicament and was unwilling to directly support Ashida, thus losing his support. However, the Allied forces claimed that the Kurisu bribery case should not be the responsibility of all cabinet members, which indirectly reduced Ashida's involvement. Originally, Ashida was a person with the least sense of political responsibility. After the Nishio bribery case occurred, his attitude was so smooth that it was unpredictable. After the Kurisu corruption case occurred, he once again stated that he was not politically responsible, only feeling regret on a moral level, which is not the attitude of a politician at all. Ashida's cabinet resigned due to the above three circumstances, which was neither accidental nor unexpected. Ashida has become a political dross in Japan. Standing in the position of the Allied forces controlling Japan, we should let it be abandoned by the times without reservation.

Now, the most likely successor to the Ashida Cabinet, both legally and circumstantially, is the Democratic Liberal Party. Legally speaking, the Democratic Liberal Party occupies 151 seats out of the 466 seats in the House of Representatives (with 18 vacant seats), the Socialist Party occupies 110 seats, the Democratic Party occupies 90 seats, and other small conservative parties tend to lean towards the Democratic Liberal Party, so the Democratic Liberal Party should be the majority party in the House. At the same time, Shigeru Yoshida was the opposition party to the two cabinets of Katayama and Ashida, and it is logical that the Democratic Liberal Party should come forward to form a cabinet. From a circumstantial point of view, left-wing parties cannot rise under MacArthur's control of Japan, and the "middle-of-the-road line" of Katayama and Ashida has failed successively, which shows that there is no way for "centrist politics." Of course, the only option is to return to conservatism and lean to the right, which is obviously opening the way for Shigeru Yoshida. Yoshida is a stubborn diplomat whose strong personality is not suitable for political party life, and the party lacks talent. All of the party's central and local members are heavily imbued with the atmosphere of financial groups and landlords, and their reactionary political views are shocking. Shigeru Yoshida's desire to form a one-party cabinet and his disapproval of a multi-party coalition government fully demonstrate his stubborn and reactionary nature. However, according to the habits of Japanese politics today, the formation of a cabinet by the majority party must be approved by MacArthur. MacArthur does not feel particularly interested in Yoshida. If he agrees to Yoshida's formation of a one-party conservative cabinet, he will inevitably be criticized by the Allied countries and will demonstrate the failure of Japan's democratization over the past three years. It is not yet known whether MacArthur will agree to a one-party conservative cabinet or a multi-party conservative cabinet in his meeting with Yoshida, or whether he will support someone else to clean up the mess and hold new general elections. In short, the emergence of this new cabinet in Japan is not only a major test of future political trends in Japan, but also the greatest test of the Allied forces' policy of controlling Japan. Let us wait and see.

### Accelerating the Sale of Enemy and Puppet Properties: The Executive Yuan Passes Measures in Routine Meeting

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 13th] The Executive Yuan, in its routine meeting on the morning of the 13th, passed the "Measures for Accelerating the Sale of Enemy and Puppet Properties" drafted by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Committee. The main points are as follows:

(1) The sale of enemy and puppet properties shall be based on market value appraisal, and the current occupants shall be notified to purchase them within 15 days. A deposit of half the amount shall be paid first, and the balance shall be paid in full within one month from the date of notification. Failure to pay within the deadline will result in forfeiture of the deposit. If the purchase is not made within 15 days, it will be considered a waiver, and the property will be publicly auctioned. Current occupants are still allowed to participate in the bidding.

(2) Current occupants of enemy and puppet properties must vacate the premises within one month from the date of waiving the purchase. If they fail to relocate within the deadline, the Economic Supervisory Office, local government, military, and police agencies shall enforce the eviction.

(3) Enemy and puppet properties, including those that have not been transferred to serve as reserves for the issuance of Gold Yuan notes, shall be handled uniformly and completed within six months.

(4) Government agencies using such properties shall also sell them in accordance with these measures, unless the transfer of ownership has been approved by the Executive Yuan.

(5) Real estate revaluation committees shall be established in various districts to sell enemy and puppet properties, and representatives from civil, judicial, and other agencies, social organizations, and experts shall be appointed as members. Representatives from local audit agencies shall also be invited to participate (the valuation methods will be determined separately).

(6) Enemy-built houses on private land shall be handled in accordance with the regulations for handling enemy and puppet buildings on private land in recovered areas. If enemy and puppet properties that were purchased or forcibly purchased can be redeemed by the original owners, the original owners may still request the right to prioritize paying the price to reclaim them, and are not subject to these measures.

(7) If private properties have been improved or renovated by the enemy or puppets, the original owners shall be allowed to prioritize purchasing the improved or renovated parts.

(8) For enemy and puppet houses that have been damaged by war, if private individuals have repaired or built and occupied them, the land and houses may be allowed to be handled by the repairers or builders in accordance with the provisions of these measures.

### Supplementary Measures to Stabilize the Value of the Gold Yuan: Proposal by Legislator Shen Chongyu and 126 Others (Full Text)

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] A proposal by Legislator Shen Chongyu and 126 others to supplement measures to stabilize the value of the Gold Yuan, in order to enhance the credibility of the currency system and facilitate its implementation, is as follows:

Reasons: The key to maintaining the value of the Gold Yuan lies in establishing credibility and increasing production. When Kong Xiangxi and others replaced silver dollars with the legal tender (fabi), it was successful because the government was able to maintain the currency's credibility, the public did not fear malignant inflation, there was no conversion problem between the old and new currencies, and there were no significant price fluctuations. Therefore, even after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the currency's value was maintained for two or three years without a significant decline. Unfortunately, the government first damaged its credibility by misappropriating the currency reserve and ignoring US dollar savings bonds and US dollar public bonds from before the 25th year of the Republic (Kong Xiangxi still had foreign exchange, gold, and silver worth approximately 900 million US dollars when he was in office, and Song Ziwen still had over 300 million when he left office). Therefore, the current problem is the existence of credibility, rather than insufficient controls. What is called credibility is the re-creation of credibility, not the continued maintenance of credibility. Therefore, cultivating credibility is the first priority for establishing a currency system. The amount of currency that society can absorb is directly proportional to the size of its productive capacity. If productive capacity is small, even if the amount issued is small, there will be a surplus of funds, which will cause malignant inflation. Conversely, if productive capacity is large, even if the amount issued is large, it will be backed by real goods, and not only will there be no feeling of inflation, but it will also promote the people's livelihood. However, in general, all production industries are showing signs of decline. Even in Shanghai, the surplus of electricity and unusually bright lights are due to factory closures, which is a clear indication. It must be understood that shrinking production will reduce tax revenues, and the proportion of government spending maintained by issuing currency will increase. Shrinking production will also reduce the capacity to absorb currency, both of which will make society feel uncertain about currency inflation. Therefore, increasing production is the second priority for stabilizing the value of the currency.

For the above reasons, we hereby propose the following supplementary measures to stabilize the value of the Gold Yuan:

(A) Regarding Cultivating Issuance Credibility

(1) Expand and reorganize the existing Issuance Supervision Committee, increasing the number of members. The candidates for the committee should be selected from each region of the country who have a reputation in finance and financial matters.

(Explanation) China has a vast territory and inconvenient transportation. In order to make the entire population trust the agency that manages the issuance, the character of the people in this managing and issuing agency must be such that the people in each area using the Gold Yuan have a considerable understanding of them and believe that they can be trusted. Although many of the people currently appointed to the Issuance Supervision Committee are well-known figures, they are mostly concentrated in Shanghai, and the people in the hinterland and remote provinces are mostly unfamiliar with them. Therefore, it is necessary to expand and reorganize the committee. To avoid having too many people and making it difficult to be flexible, three or five standing committee members can be mutually elected from the committee to be responsible for day-to-day affairs, and a full meeting can be held every half month or month. This Issuance Supervision Committee is not only an agency for supervising the issuance, its main role should be to re-create the credibility of the issuance. Therefore, its duties should include: 1. Being able to participate in managing and applying the issuance reserves (including the materials in the next clause). 2. Being able to control the amount of issuance. (Continued on page 4)

### Korean Situation Becomes Increasingly Chaotic: Soviet Union Recognizes North Korean Regime, Exchange of Notes Establishes Foreign Relations, South Korea Condemns North Korean Organization as Illegal and Ineligible to Attend the UN

[United Press, London, 13th] Soviet Radio in Moscow broadcast on the 13th that Premier Stalin, in response to Premier Kim Il-sung of the North Korean People's Democratic Republic, stated that the Soviet Union is willing to establish diplomatic relations with North Korea.

[United Press, Moscow, 13th] Soviet Marshal Stalin and North Korean Chairman of the Council of Ministers Kim Il-sung established diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the "Korean People's Democratic Republic" on the 13th through an exchange of notes. This move was expected after the Soviet government announced last month that it would withdraw its troops from Korea. Other Eastern European countries will follow suit and recognize North Korea.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 13th] Moscow Radio announced this morning that Marshal Stalin, on behalf of the Soviet government, acknowledged receiving a letter from North Korean Premier Kim Il-sung on the 8th, urging the establishment of diplomatic and economic relations and the exchange of ambassadors between the two countries. In his reply, Stalin stated: "He has always supported the right of the Korean people to establish an independent government, welcomes the Korean people's organization of a government, and is willing to see them work to complete the restoration and democratic development." Moscow Radio also stated that Stalin's reply was sent on October 12th.

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 13th] Pyongyang Broadcasting quoted a report from the North Korean Central News Agency stating that rallies are being held daily throughout North Korea to bid farewell to the returning Soviet troops. Many liberation memorial towers and Soviet military memorial towers and Soviet military bases have been built in various places. At the rallies in Haizhou, Nanan, Hamhung, and Pyongyang, citizens shouted slogans such as "Korean-Soviet Friendship."

[United Press, Seoul, 13th] An American man who returned here on the evening of the 12th from the border between the US and the Soviet Union stated that the Soviet troops are withdrawing from the border and being replaced by North Korean troops. The North Korean army fired light weapons at the American army, which retaliated with heavy weapons and defeated them. The American saw a Korean man through binoculars, motionless, apparently dead, and another was being carried away by his companion.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] The South Korean delegation to the United Nations issued a statement today stating: "The nine members of the Korean delegation are now in Paris awaiting an opportunity to present the case of the Republic of Korea government to the United Nations General Assembly. The Korean delegation has formally requested that Korean representatives be allowed to participate in the First Committee when the Korean issue is discussed." The statement continued: "The establishment of the Republic of Korea was due to a popular election agreed to and supervised by a United Nations Commission. Two-thirds of the people in the country participated in the election, while the other one-third were unable to participate because the Soviet-occupied zone refused to allow the United Nations Commission to work." The statement further pointed out that the North Korean regime is a self-proclaimed "dictatorial regime," and therefore, in law, the North Korean regime cannot represent the Korean people. Only the South Korean delegation can represent the people and attend the United Nations General Assembly.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] The South Korean delegation in Paris on the 12th denounced the Pyongyang regime, saying that it cannot be allowed to attend the United Nations to present its views on Korea.

### Under Soviet Control: Eastern European Countries Plan Alliance for Foreign and Economic Cooperation to Counter Western Europe

[United Press, Prague, 12th] Reliable sources claimed on the 12th that the Soviet Union has decided to conclude an Eastern European alliance to counter the Western European alliance. The decision to organize the Eastern European "People's Democratic Alliance" is believed to have been made at a meeting of senior Eastern European political leaders in Crimea last month, and is expected to be announced soon.

It is said that the Eastern European alliance will include countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. It is also said that the planners of this plan also hope to recruit Yugoslavia to join, even though it has been expelled from the Cominform. The inclusion of the Soviet-occupied zone of Austria is also said to be under consideration, and the inclusion of East Germany will be considered later. The exact form of the proposed Eastern European alliance has not been disclosed, but it is said that dozens of experts from the participating countries will meet in Prague this week to draft a detailed plan. The Eastern European alliance is expected to focus on economic cooperation, possibly starting with a customs union between these countries and long-term cooperation in economic planning. The organization will be under Soviet control, but will not merge into the Soviet Union or form a new country. It may follow the form of the Benelux customs union. Each participating country will retain its own government and foreign representatives, and the cooperation in foreign policy, which has already been realized in practice, will inevitably be greatly strengthened under this plan.

### Soviet Union Demands Withdrawal of Military Missions from China, Australia, etc. in Berlin

[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 13th, broadcast from Berlin: The Soviet Union has suggested that countries such as China, India, Australia, and the Netherlands close their military missions stationed in Berlin and withdraw to their home countries. There are at least fifteen military missions stationed with the Four-Power Control Committee. According to the Soviet official news agency, regarding the military missions of various countries, the Soviet Commander in Germany, Sokolovsky, has stated to the commanders of the United States, Britain, and France: "The military missions of various countries are stationed with the Four-Power Control Committee. Now that the Control Committee no longer exists, the stationed missions are also no longer possible." It is said that the Western military governors have not yet announced their position on the Soviet proposal. According to the Four-Power Control Committee, since the Soviet Union announced on March 20th that "the Committee no longer exists," it has not held a meeting. At the same time, the Western powers have not recognized the Soviet Union's unilateral attempt to dissolve the Control Committee.

### Berlin Municipal Council Moves to British Zone

400,000 German Militiamen Trained by Soviets

[United Press, Berlin, 13th] The Berlin Municipal Council announced on the afternoon of the 13th, after meeting in the Soviet zone, that its headquarters would be moved to the British zone.

[United Press, Berlin, 13th] The German-language "Daily Mirror," licensed by the United States, published on the 13th a statement from a refugee in the Soviet zone stating that the Soviet Union has begun to station the newly formed "militia" in the former headquarters of the Nazi military organization. At least eight old barracks have been reopened. The Soviets have trained and armed 400,000 militiamen, organized from war prisoners, highly centralized, and not divided by provinces or towns.

### Our Attitude Unchanged in Opposing Western Participation in the UN General Assembly

Recognizing North Korean Election as Illegal

[Central News Agency, Paris, 12th] Chiang Tingfu, our country's representative to the United Nations, stated today that China will vote against allowing Spain to participate in the United Nations when the issue is raised for discussion, because Spain's situation remains the same as in the past. When China refuses to allow participation, he stated that allowing new member states must be unanimously approved by the five permanent members of the Security Council. Regarding the issue of the Pyongyang regime requesting to send representatives to attend the United Nations, as requested by Moscow Radio, Chiang stated that the Korean government was produced under the supervision of representatives sent by the United Nations, but how the election in North Korea was conducted is unknown to the world.

### If the Soviet Union Has Sincere Intentions for Peace, It Should Abandon the Fifth Column: British Representative Challenges Vyshinsky

[United Press, Paris, 13th] British representative Sir Alexander Cadogan, during the disarmament debate in the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly today, urged the Soviet Union to abandon using the "fifth column of covert armies of the Communist Party" as part of its disarmament plan. Cadogan stated that as long as the Soviet Union maintains the fifth column worldwide, its proposal to disarm one-third of its forces within one year is "meaningless," because the fifth column aims to sabotage economic recovery and create political chaos.

He stated, "If the Soviet Union is sincere about the return of confidence and stability to the earth, it should lift the Iron Curtain, as 'a card laid on the table.'" Cadogan challenged the Soviet Union, saying, "When you ask us to support your plan, are you also willing to sign a convention to abandon your fifth column and stop all plans to sabotage the recovery of Europe and Asia? We do not object even if the Soviet Union does not allow the existence of opposition parties and propaganda that is hostile to the government within its own country. What we object to is the Soviet-led underground sabotage and reckless propaganda. The efforts of France, China, Italy, Iran, Indonesia, and Malaya to achieve economic recovery and the rise of democracy are all hindered by foreign-guided Communist actions. Moscow only needs to say one word, and those countries can flourish. You say you do not want war, perhaps that is so, but history proves that even Hitler did not thirst for war. But you hope to achieve victory without war. Therefore, while holding powerful military forces that make the world uneasy, you are also using the fifth column in every country." Cadogan urged the Soviet Union to reconsider, make concessions on the control of atomic energy and disarmament, and responded to Vyshinsky's statement that Cadogan's and his opinions differed because "we have different hearts" by saying: "This statement is sad, and I hope and believe it is not correct, because my heart, like the heart of my country, hopes for peace, not a peace of enslavement or a peace of annihilation, but a peace of glory and friendship for all mankind. Appeasement cannot achieve this, and the lessons of the past are clear. I will use an objective and peaceful attitude to solve it in a more calm atmosphere with reasonable, practical, and effective methods."

### Malik Counterattacks

[Associated Press] Paris, 13th, broadcast: Soviet representative Malik, in his rebuttal to Cadogan in the Political Committee, accused his speech of being full of "lies and slanders," "picking up the remnants of Trotsky, Hitler, and Goebbels." He strongly stated that there is no so-called Iron Curtain for those who are willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union and those who need peace and friendship. Malik stated, "The Soviet Union needs coordination. We had no difficulty reaching an agreement with Roosevelt, but people like Cadogan seem to have no need for agreement."

### Vyshinsky's Remarks Involve the Chinese Communist Party: Chiang Tingfu Issues a Statement, Saying It Violates the Spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty

[Central News Agency, Paris, 12th] Although our country does not want to discuss domestic issues in international meetings, in the past day, the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly specifically mentioned the rebellion of the Chinese Communist Party during its disarmament debate. The extremely different opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union on China have forced us to make a statement. The statement issued by Chiang Tingfu, our representative to the United Nations, stated that China can never accept the Soviet proposal to reduce one-third of its troops, which has caused an open debate between the United States and the Soviet Union on Chinese affairs. Soviet representative Vyshinsky announced his views on China this afternoon, while US representative Austin informally supported our government in refuting other issues. Chiang Tingfu, our representative, refuted Vyshinsky's attack on China, saying that this move was purely irrelevant. People in our country here said, "Vyshinsky's accusations directly violate the provisions in the Sino-Soviet Treaty that the Soviet Union supports the Chinese government in spirit or material."

### French Representative Proposes New Disarmament Proposal: Debate in Political Committee Ends

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 13th] The Political Committee of the UN General Assembly continued its meeting at 10:50 this morning to discuss the Soviet disarmament proposal. French representative Parodi announced that he was moving to draft a resolution that would include all the key points of the debate so far. The resolution stated that the General Assembly would recommend the following to the Security Council: (1) Establish a control agency to control the number of troops and old weapons of each country based on the statements submitted by the governments to the control agency within a certain period, and the control agency will conduct on-site investigations of the points stated in the governments' statements, and the United Nations Secretariat will publish the above statements. (2) Promote the gradual and universal limitation of armaments and conventional weapons. (3) Prepare a report on this matter, no later than the convening of the next regular session to discuss this proposal, so that the General Assembly can carry out its activities in accordance with the disarmament goals and principles stipulated in the Charter. At this point, Ukrainian representative Manuilsky urged to end the debate, saying that the debate "leads us to get involved in purely theoretical discussions." Chairman Spaak expressed his agreement, saying that lengthy speeches do not help solve the problem. Finally, after the representatives moved to end the debate, the motion was passed by a vote of 31 to 5 (11 abstentions), and the Political Committee adjourned at 12:55 noon.

### Mrs. Pandit to be Transferred as Ambassador to the United States

[Central News Agency, London, 13th (Associated Press)] It has been learned from authoritative sources that Mrs. Pandit, sister of Indian Prime Minister Nehru and current Indian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, will be transferred as Ambassador to the United States. Mrs. Pandit is currently the head of the Indian delegation to the UN General Assembly. After the meeting, she will return to India for a short rest and then proceed to Washington to take up her new post.

### U.S. Military Preparations Aim to Prevent War

[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] U.S. Army Chief of Plans and Operations, General Weidemeyer, declared today that the purpose of U.S. military expansion is to deter war, not to prepare for war. Weidemeyer made a speech on television broadcasting entitled "To What Extent is the United States Approaching War?" Weidemeyer did not directly answer this question but stated that the U.S. military is engaged in preventing war by means of strength to secure peace and security. External accusations that the U.S. Army dominates U.S. foreign policy are incorrect. U.S. foreign policy is created by the American people, not by the Department of the Army. U.S. national policy is determined by the President, Congress, and the Department of State. When the people disagree with certain policies adopted by the executive branch, foreign policy is quickly corrected. The only thing that the U.S. military has to do with foreign policy is to ensure our support for policies at home and abroad, which is the true meaning of all our armed forces.

### Palestine-Arab-Jewish Dispute to be Discussed by the Security Council Today; Berlin Issue Awaits Soviet Response, Debate Postponed

[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 13th, wireless report: The Security Council will hold a meeting on the 14th to discuss the report on the violation of the truce agreement by the Palestinian Arabs and Jews. This meeting will be convened by Mr. Osmańczyk, who has assumed the presidency of the Security Council for this month.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] The six "neutral countries" in the Security Council continued their behind-the-scenes activities today in an attempt to mediate the Berlin crisis. The next Security Council meeting is likely to be postponed until Saturday or next week. According to well-informed sources, although the three Western powers still insist that the Berlin blockade must be lifted before negotiations begin, the Soviet proposal for "simultaneous progress" may also be accepted. Neutral diplomats pointed out that simultaneous negotiations and lifting the blockade are the only way to untie the Gordian knot of Berlin. Security Council President, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, is awaiting the Soviet response to his suggestion.

### Nehru to Go to Paris Tomorrow

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] Indian Prime Minister Nehru is currently in London attending the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. It is expected that he will arrive in Paris on October 15 and will meet with various French dignitaries. French President Auriol and Foreign Minister Schuman will both receive him. Nehru will also visit UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie and U.S. Secretary of State Marshall.

### French Cabinet Examines Wages to End Labor Strikes; Italian Civil Servants' General Strike for Nine Hours

Italian Civil Servants' General Strike for Nine Hours

[Associated Press, Paris, 13th] French Prime Minister Guy Mollet convened a full cabinet meeting on the 13th to study the government's wage proposals in order to resolve the strike wave of 500,000 coal miners and other workers in basic industries.

[Associated Press, Paris, 13th] Dockworkers belonging to the French Communist General Confederation of Labor held a 24-hour protest strike in various ports on the 13th, while the back-to-work movement of railway workers is expanding.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 13th] Civil servants in Italian government agencies and state-owned enterprises will hold a general strike for nine hours from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on the 14th. However, civil servants in the railways and customs will only hold a two-hour strike. Workers in telegrams, telephones, gas, and electricity will continue to work as usual throughout the day. This strike was decided by the left-wing General Confederation of Labor and was also agreed upon by the Italian Independent Trade Union and the right-wing trade union.

### The New Japanese Cabinet is Delayed and Difficult to Produce; The Democratic and Liberal Parties are Conducting Black Market Negotiations; Nomination of the New Prime Minister Postponed Until Today

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] The nomination election for the next Japanese Prime Minister, postponed for one day, was supposed to be held on the afternoon of the 13th. However, as a result of a meeting of the House Steering Committee of the House of Representatives at 5:35 p.m. today, it was decided to postpone it again for one day, to be held on the 14th. At the meeting, although the Liberal Party proposed holding it on the night of the 13th, the Democratic Party proposed postponing it to the 14th because there were still points that needed to be reviewed. At the request of the Liberal Party, the meeting was temporarily adjourned at 6:15 p.m. After the meeting reopened, it accommodated the opinions of all parties and decided to postpone it again for one day, adjourning at 7:07 p.m.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Rumors are circulating that Shigeru Yoshida, who was regarded as the "most likely candidate for Prime Minister," may be rejected. It is reported that Takeshi Yamazaki, Secretary-General of the Democratic Liberal Party, has been promoted as a "suitable candidate." However, this afternoon, Takeshi Yamazaki issued a statement frankly denying any intention of succeeding as Prime Minister. He told members of his party in parliament: "Even if appointed, I will never accept the position of Prime Minister."

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Jiro Hoshijima, Chief Secretary of the Japanese Democratic Party, visited Democratic Party Secretary-General Kokumidi on the afternoon of the 12th to discuss the next cabinet. It is reported that regarding the issue of how to compromise on the Liberal Party's proposed conservative united front policy and the Democratic Party's proposed national unity policy, Hoshijima hoped that the Democratic Party would make slight concessions on the method of forming a cabinet, and the Liberal Party was willing to make concessions to the Democratic Socialist Party in terms of the number and positions of cabinet members. It is generally speculated that if this black market negotiation still cannot reach a compromise, the Democratic Party may cast blank ballots during the nomination of the Prime Minister. [Associated Press, Tokyo, 13th] The continued opposition of many political figures to Shigeru Yoshida, considering him a "reactionary," has delayed his anticipated selection as the new Prime Minister. When Allied officials declared that the decision on the selection of the new Prime Minister was entirely a matter for the Japanese themselves, some Japanese political figures spread rumors that MacArthur did not want Yoshida to serve as Prime Minister again. Yoshida was first appointed Prime Minister by Emperor Hirohito in May 1946 and collapsed in May 1947. According to the previous procedures of the Diet, when there is no clear majority party in the Diet, the leader of the majority party will be elected as Prime Minister. In this case, Yoshida would be the most suitable candidate, as the Democratic Liberal Party holds 151 of the 466 seats in the House of Representatives. However, Yoshida's opponents argue that because he is a reactionary, his election will have a negative national impact. Yoshida's supporters are urging the Diet to convene a plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 13th to elect the Prime Minister so that the election can proceed before opponents can form a collective to obstruct his election. It is reported that former Prime Minister Ashida, who collapsed from the cabinet, also opposes Yoshida, mainly due to the long-term competition between the two in the past.

### On Colonial Issues, Britain and the United States Oppose Soviet Proposals

[Report from this newspaper] Paris, 13th, wireless report: U.S. Representative Sayre and British Representative Adams stated in the UN Trusteeship Committee that the British and U.S. governments opposed the Soviet proposal that the United Nations send personnel to inspect various colonies every year and that each administering country should provide the United Nations with political information about the colonies. They accused the Soviet Union of attempting to gain "selfish political advantages" in colonial affairs through this move.

### Indonesian Communist Party Leaders Arrested

[Associated Press, Batavia, 12th] Radio Indonesia reported on the 12th that twelve Indonesian Communist Party leaders had been arrested. Aliarcham, a Moscow-trained Indonesian Communist Party leader disguised as a farmer, was captured on a train in East Java. It is said that Aliarcham arrived in Indonesia from Moscow two years ago to serve as the Communist Party leader until Musa arrived in Indonesia eight days ago. The Indonesian police are still searching for Musa, who disappeared after the Republic occupied Madiun.

### British Imperial Conference Reviewed; Far East and Middle East Situation; British Commonwealth Plans to Dissuade India from Establishing a Republic

[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] The British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference has been held for two days. According to an official announcement, the meeting discussed the international situation, especially the Middle East and Far East issues. British High Commissioner for Southeast Asia MacDonald gave a detailed account of the situation in Malaya. According to well-informed sources here, the discussion at today's meeting on the unrest in Southeast Asia focused on constructive methods to eliminate this unrest and communist activities, and on improving the living conditions of the indigenous people. Although staff officers participated in the meeting, specific defense issues have been postponed for discussion. It is also heard that Foreign Secretary Bevin gave his views on several other issues in Asia at the meeting, including the Japanese peace treaty. The Commonwealth, especially those in the Pacific, intends to participate as closely as possible in the Japanese peace conference.

[Associated Press, London, 12th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin warned in his speech at the Commonwealth Conference on the 12th that the Far East and the Middle East are weak links in the chain of anti-communist defense. Bevin spoke for more than an hour on taking various measures to strengthen defense loopholes, especially in Malaya, where Britain recently sent troops to suppress the communist rebellion. He focused on the communist issue in the Far East.

[Associated Press, London, 13th] The Prime Ministers of the British Commonwealth countries are extremely anxious because India's possible withdrawal from the Commonwealth will create a major loophole in the global anti-communist strategy. The Commonwealth Conference continued to discuss the economy on the 13th. Behind-the-scenes negotiations have begun to try to dissuade India's 400 million people from establishing an independent republic. New Zealand and Australia, deeply aware of the danger of this move, have issued warnings. This issue is considered extremely serious. Some suggested that if a deadlock is reached, the opinion of the United States should be sought. New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser, speaking on behalf of the Far Eastern countries, said that the greatest hope for peace lies in whether the Far Eastern countries can urge India not to withdraw from the Commonwealth, thereby weakening the worldwide anti-communist chain.

In the future, if scalpers are caught, they will definitely be specially assigned to labor teams for forced labor. As for the supply of silk, efforts have been made to purchase it from Wuxing. After Supervisor Chiang expressed his opinions, the representatives of each industry, in addition to expressing their support for the policy, still hoped that the government would strive to increase production to solve the problem fundamentally. The meeting ended at 6:00 p.m.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Transporting Grain; Approved to Purchase in the Mainland

[Report from this newspaper] Xu Xueyu, General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, visited Supervisor Chiang yesterday afternoon at 5:00 p.m. to discuss the issue of the company's food rice supply for the future.

The Municipal Police Bureau was ordered yesterday by the Supervisor's Office to establish a vegetable market management committee in order to eliminate the black market and dredge vegetable supplies. The committee will be jointly organized by the Police Bureau, the Social Bureau, the Finance Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Civil Affairs Bureau, the Suppression and Construction Team, the City Council, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. After receiving the order, Director Yu of the Police Bureau immediately convened relevant agencies and trade associations at the bureau's seventh floor to discuss various issues. More than 40 representatives from the Fishing Wheel Industry Association, the Tofu Industry Association, the Fish Trade Association, the Fish Peddlers' Mutual Benefit Association, the Marine Products Marketing Association, the Shanghai Fish Market, the Vegetable Industry Association, the Local Goods Trade Association, the First and Second Markets of the Vegetable and Local Goods Joint Venture, the Second District Vegetable Market Mutual Aid Association, the Seventh District Vegetable Market Stall Owners' Mutual Aid Association, the Chicken and Duck Trade Association, the Fourth and Eleventh District Tile Aid Associations, and the Social Bureau, the Finance Bureau, the Health Bureau, and other agencies attended.

The detailed measures are being drafted by the Police Bureau.

### Agreed on a Method for Rationing Fish; Unified Distribution Begins Today; Fishmongers No Longer Need to Queue

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the fish industry in the city, the Fish Market Brokers Association accused the Fishmongers' Mutual Benefit Association of disrupting the fish rationing system, and the Fishmongers' Mutual Benefit Association refuted it, accusing the brokers of colluding with scalpers to manipulate fish prices, which once caused disputes. To mediate the conflict between the two, the Fish Market specially invited the Brokers' Association, the Fishmongers' Mutual Benefit Association, the Fishing Wheel Association, the 14th Brigade of the Youth Service Corps, and other relevant fishery groups to hold a meeting at the market yesterday. The focus of the meeting was on how to improve the fish distribution method and eliminate the black market for fish. The Fishmongers' Mutual Benefit Association stated that fish supplies are currently in the off-season, with not much arriving. More than 4,000 fishmongers queue up every day to wait for distribution. Due to insufficient distribution, half of the fishmongers are often unable to purchase fish, resulting in some areas of the city being short of fish, while others have no fish at all. Black market fish prices have therefore occurred, so improvements were requested. After discussion, eight concrete measures were decided, which will be implemented after being approved by the authorities as soon as possible. Among them, the measure that will be implemented starting today is that fishmongers no longer need to queue up. They only need to register at the market from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. the day before, obtain a job certificate, and distribute the fish in a unified manner according to the amount of fish. It is heard that the industry will continue to hold a meeting at the City Fisheries Association this afternoon to continue discussing issues related to fish distribution.

### The Only Hope for Silver Shops is to Solve the Raw Material Problem

[Report from this newspaper] According to Wu Pengnian, Chairman of the Silver Shop Association, the industry's recent application to the Social Bureau for permission to suspend business was truly a last resort. During the recent buying spree, the daily income of the silver seed industry from old gold jewelry was almost non-existent, while buyers and exchangers came every day to investigate. The gold reserves of the industry were almost exhausted, and business could not continue. It was necessary to request a temporary suspension of business so that it could continue to open its doors when the market situation stabilized. The industry's only hope is still to solve the problem of raw materials for jewelry gold. It is now waiting for the authorities to promulgate the management measures for the silver shop industry to follow.

### Appeal of Defendants in the Dance Hall Case; Criminal Division of the High Court Pronounced Judgment Yesterday; Sentences of Zhu Fei and 13 Others Increased or Decreased; Jin Ying and 11 Others Treated Leniently, All Given Suspended Sentences

[Report from this newspaper] The Criminal Division of the High Court pronounced judgment yesterday on the appeals of the defendants in the dance hall case. The main text: "The original judgment regarding the crimes and sentences of Zhu Fei and others is revoked. Zhu Fei is sentenced to three years of imprisonment for openly gathering a crowd and jointly implementing violence and coercion when a civil servant was performing his duties according to law. Zeng Zhigang and Pan Zhiguang are sentenced to one and a half years of imprisonment for openly gathering a crowd and jointly implementing violence and coercion when a civil servant was performing his duties according to law. Li Meijuan, Ruan Jianmin, Zhao Aqing, Gu Kerren, Lu Jialin, Yu Zhiqin, Li Ying, Wang Danglin, Zhu Caigen, and Shi Meifang are sentenced to six months of imprisonment for openly gathering a crowd and jointly implementing violence and coercion when a civil servant was performing his duties according to law. Cheng Yinkang, Qin Xianfen, and Jin Ying are sentenced to three months of imprisonment, with a three-year suspended sentence. Li Genfang, Xu Jiecai, Xia Shaotang, Wang Xianliang, Meng Yan, and Sun Zhimin are sentenced to three months of imprisonment, with a three-year suspended sentence, for aiding others who were implementing violence and coercion against civil servants performing their duties according to law. Jin Meihong is sentenced to two months of imprisonment, with a two-year suspended sentence, for aiding others who were openly gathering a crowd to implement violence and coercion against civil servants performing their duties according to law. Other appeals are dismissed. Chen Ayao, two-year suspended sentence."

### Reasons for the Verdict

The High Court's reasons for the judgment in this case: (1) Zhu's crime, the original sentence of four years, was changed to three years, based on the testimony of Song Tingjun, the director of the Songshan Police Station: "There was no prior conspiracy, it was purely a spur-of-the-moment decision." Therefore, Zhu was not the "mastermind," which can be determined, and the original judgment sentencing him as the mastermind seemed inappropriate. (2) Zeng Zhigang and Pan Zhiguang, originally sentenced to three years and six months, were changed to one and a half years. Because both of them were not first-time offenders, and their circumstances were lighter than Zhu Fei, they should be dealt with leniently. (3) Li Meijuan, Ruan Jianmin, Zhao Aqing, and Gu Keren, originally sentenced to one year, were changed to six months. Lu Jialin, Yu Zhiqin, Li Ying, Wang Fulin, Zhu Caigen, and Shi Meifang, originally sentenced to five months, were changed to six months. The original judgment only considered the act of damaging public property, but it was also a kind of implementing violence and coercion, the same as assaulting police officers. It cannot be said that there was no connection in intent, which obviously has a relationship of violence and coercion to obstruct official duties. It should be punished with the more severe offense, and not only for damaging public property. (4) Cheng Shikang, Qin Xianfen, and Jin Yingjun are all 18 years old and have their sentences reduced according to law, and have not received a sentence of imprisonment. It is considered appropriate not to execute the sentence, which is in accordance with the Probation Regulations. (5) Regarding Li Genfang, Xu Jiecai, Xia Shaotang, Wang Xianliang, Meng Yan, Sun Zhimin, and Jin Meihong: The defendants consistently denied that they jointly implemented violence and coercion at the scene. After careful investigation, although the appellants did not commit other violent acts, their support at the scene was extremely obvious, and none of them can be exempted from guilt. Considering that the appellants have not received a sentence of imprisonment, the court agreed to the principle of non-execution and should grant probation. However, Jin Meihong has not reached the legal age and her sentence is reduced according to law, and then granted probation. (6) Regarding the part of dismissing the appeal: Yu Jinbao and Zhao Zhengxiang were sentenced to one year of imprisonment in the first instance in accordance with Article 136, paragraph 1, and Article 138 of the Criminal Law, which is not inappropriate. The appeal should be considered unreasonable and dismissed. Furthermore, Chen A's case has no prior criminal record and is also in accordance with the Probation Regulations. It is appropriate not to execute the sentence for the time being, and it should be known that probation is granted.

### Youth Service Team Tours the City to Serve

The Youth Service Headquarters has planned to organize "Mobile Service Teams," dispatching 20 to 40 teams daily to tour the city for service, investigating the black market and accepting confidential reports from the people.

### Huang Pinfa Invents a Mileage Calculator for Rickshaws

Recently, rickshaw pullers have been arbitrarily raising prices, which the citizens deeply suffer from. Huang Pinfa, a mechanic, after more than a month of research, has recently invented a "mileage calculator." Yesterday, Mr. Huang took it to the Central Bank to meet with supervisor Jiang Jingguo. Mr. Jiang specially appointed Deputy Director Zhang Shiyan of the Police Department to meet him. Zhang highly praised Mr. Huang's invention of the mileage calculator and promised to forward it to the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau and Public Utilities Bureau for filing. The "calculator" is quite similar to an ordinary clock. The surface has numbers from one to twelve, with only a long and short hand. One rotation of the long hand is equal to traveling one mile, and one rotation of the short hand is equal to traveling twelve miles. The odometer is installed on the left side of the seat back, and the mechanism is installed on the axles of the rickshaw and handcart. Once the wheels turn, the long hand on the odometer will automatically rotate. In the future, if the authorities set the fare for each mile of the rickshaw, passengers can see the mileage indicated on the odometer before getting on and off the car, and pay the fare. It is extremely fair and can reduce many unnecessary disputes between rickshaw pullers and passengers.

Can prevent rickshaw pullers from arbitrarily raising prices. Reduce many unnecessary disputes.

### Qiantang Express Train Damaged, Delayed by Three Hours, Travelers Frowned

[Our newspaper's report] The Qiantang Express train directly to Beijing and Hangzhou was delayed for three hours yesterday, arriving in Shanghai at 4:40 PM. Due to the delay of the Qiantang Express, the 5th, 17th, 11th, and 15th express trains were also delayed. It is reported that the Qiantang Express drove to Kunshan, 52 kilometers away from Shanghai, at 1:11 PM. The right driving rotary handle of the locomotive suddenly broke, and the train could not move forward. An urgent telegram was sent to the Weiting Station to remove the locomotive of the 51st train and drive it to send the Qiantang Express to Kunshan Station for another locomotive to be replaced. However, due to the various procedures of disassembly and transfer, a lot of time was wasted, and the passengers were all displeased.

### No. 2 Route B Public Bus to be Changed to Shuttle Bus from Tomorrow, No. 14 to Temporarily Stop at the Mint Bridge

[Our newspaper's report] The No. 2 Route B public bus, run by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, originally ran from Laoximen to Zhongshan North Road. In response to the requests of residents in the northern district, it has been decided to change the bus route to a shuttle bus at Qiujiang Road from tomorrow, specifically running the Qiujiang Road-Zhongshan North Road shuttle bus, and increasing the number of vehicles. The original No. 2 buses will still run the original route, from Laoximen to Qiujiang Road.

The western terminus of the No. 14 public bus was extended from Ziyulu Mint Bridge to Xitang Road, which was quite convenient for residents there. However, the road surface is currently damaged and dangerous for vehicles to pass through. The public transportation company has decided to continue to use the Mint Bridge as the terminus from tomorrow until the road surface condition between the Mint Bridge and Xikang Road improves, and then resume driving.

### First Hearing of the Fuel Management Committee Case, Trial Lasts Eight Hours, Yang Yunfu Claims Distribution was Handled According to Old Regulations, Sun Jice Denies Sharing the Difference in Black Market Coal Prices

[Our newspaper's report] Xie Zhiying, a judge of the District Court, heard the case of Yang Yunfu, the former director of the Transportation Department of the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee, and Sun Jice, the director of the Allocation Department of the committee, colluding with coal merchants) in embezzlement and malfeasance, in the Criminal Court 8 yesterday morning at 9 a.m. Yang Yunfu, the director of the Transport Department of the Defendant Fuel Management Committee, Zou Jidao, a staff member and coal merchant, Zhao Bojun, a retired military officer, Mao Meixuan, a coal merchant, and Sun Jice, the former director of the Allocation Department of the Fuel Management Committee, Lin Keying, the chief of the section, Miao Shouzi, Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, Ren Hui, Sun Zhigang, a clerk of the Jiangzhe Inland River Shipping Company, and coal merchant Han Chengpu, were brought to court. More than a dozen witnesses, including Pan Zongli, Huang Yuncheng, Zhou Xinghuang, Chen Songshou, Bao Ruizhen (female), Yan Azhang, Xu Shouchen, Yu Quejin, Cai Hexian, Ge Jianhua, Shen Tieshi, Li Huaqing, Zhang Tiancai, and Chen Renshou, were also summoned, as well as Tang Keyue and Le Zhuangxin, officials of the Municipal Government Investigation Office handling the case, and Wang Sizu, the leader of the action team of the Jingjing Brigade, appeared in court. In addition, more than 20 other witnesses who should have been summoned, including He Zhiying, Shi Jianren, Wang Jianping, Ma Zhongliang, Chen Dong, Lu Zhida, Xie Wenguang, Chi Yunfei, Wang Qinfei, Qiu Tongwen, and Chen Zhizhang, did not appear in court. The court session began at 9 a.m. yesterday and ended at about 6 p.m., excluding a one-hour lunch break. The whole-day trial lasted eight hours and was not concluded. It is scheduled to be retried on the 20th.

More than 200 family members of the defendants attended yesterday's opening trial, and the seats were full. Yang Yunfu hired as many as six defense lawyers. The atmosphere in the court was solemn and quite tense. Judge Xie took his seat, called the defendants to the court in turn, asked about their age and origin, and immediately declared: Each defendant has not committed any crimes before, and should truthfully state their case. If they have committed a crime due to a temporary mistake, the law can grant forgiveness. If they evade the answer, and it is confirmed by investigation, the penalty will be increased. After speaking, he began to interrogate each defendant.

Arrested While Exchanging Money and Documents

The first defendant, Yang Yunfu, was wearing a brown suit with a worried expression on his face. He first responded by saying that he had worked on the Xiangqian and Qiangui railways, and on June 20, 1936, he took office as the director of the Transportation Department of the Fuel Management Committee, responsible for the safekeeping of coal. Transportation was the responsibility of the shipping department. Four coal mines in Taiwan, Kailuan, Huadong, and Huainan produced coal, which was purchased and distributed by the committee. Other coal mines were freely purchased and transported by coal merchants. The distribution measures of the committee were handled in accordance with the old regulations. Zhao Bojun responded by saying that he graduated from the 10th term of the military academy in 1927 and served as the colonel commander of the Special Task Force of the Military Commission. After retiring last year, he was introduced by a certain Ma from the Ministry of National Defense and obtained a position from Yang Yunfu. Initially, there was no contact with coal transportation. Later, because he served as the liaison officer of the "Yishe," a people's organization in the Central Hotel in this city, he became acquainted with Chen Zhiqiang, a classmate of the 3rd term of the military academy, who is now an official of the Municipal Government Investigation Office. Chen said to him that a friend who was not a coal merchant wanted to transport coal to Tianjin and needed to prepare a purchase certificate. He asked him to find a way. He then discussed with Yang Yunfu, who introduced him to Shen Jing, a coal merchant of Gongda Coal Company, to apply for it. Chen was willing to pay 3 billion yuan as a guarantee for tax payment. He and Chen's friend had never met. On September 14, he was arrested at the Queen's Cafe when exchanging money and documents, and he realized that Chen had framed him out of suspicion.

Tang Kejun Recounts the Case-Solving Process

Tang Kejun, an official of the Municipal Government Investigation Office who was ordered to design and solve the case under the pseudonym Tang Gengsheng, testified that two months ago, he was ordered to investigate the malfeasance case of the Fuel Management Committee. He pretended to Chen Zhiqiang that a friend wanted to transport 500 tons of coal to Tianjin. Chen replied that a classmate named Zhao often applied for purchase certificates for others and agreed to give a handling fee of 3 billion yuan as a reward. He reported it to his superiors. On August 7 of the old calendar, he first paid 500 million. Zhao made an appointment to meet at the Lao Zhenxing Restaurant on the 13th to give the remaining payment. On the due date, Lao Zhenxing was closely arranged, but Zhao said that the purchase certificate could not be obtained until the next day, and an appointment was made to meet at the Queen's Cafe on the 14th. At that time, Zhao and his girlfriend Bao Ruizhen were there first, and they handed over the purchase certificate. He first paid 2.5 billion yuan to Chen Zhiqiang, and Chen actually paid Zhao 2.2 billion (including 300 million yuan as Chen's kickback). After the money and documents were exchanged, Wang Sizu, the leader of the action team, immediately led the police to seize the money and goods on the spot, and took them to the bureau for interrogation. Then, Wang Sizu stated in detail how Tang Kejun used a pseudonym to solve the case, and how the numbers of the money paid by Tang were recorded in advance. Zou Jidao was then interrogated. According to the testimony, he was a coal merchant before, and then, introduced by the Coal Industry Association, he served as a staff member in the Fuel Management Committee and jointly opened Gongda Coal Company with Mao Meixuan. He was responsible for investigating the quantity and price of coal in the committee. He was not acquainted with Zhao Bojun. Applying for the purchase certificate in the name of Gongda was instructed by Yang Yunfu.

Giving Travel Expenses May Have Happened

At this point, the court summoned Le Zhuangxin, the person in charge of the Municipal Government, to provide evidence. Le said that Yang Yunfu had confessed in the police station that Gongda applied for purchase certificates on behalf of other merchants, and that Yang often borrowed money from Zou Jidao. Yang argued that applying for purchase certificates on behalf of others was a misunderstanding of urging the issuance of certificates at the meeting. Borrowing money from Zou occasionally happened, and there were no other monetary exchanges. The court reprimanded the supervisor for borrowing money from his subordinates as a strange thing.

At noon, the court adjourned for a rest. At 1:10 p.m., the trial continued, and Zou Jidao was repeatedly questioned about soliciting bribes from coal merchants. Yang Yunfu testified that last year, the output of Huadong and Huainan mines increased by more than 70,000 tons. Coal merchants sought profits and asked Nanjing to approve the purchase. Minister Chen Qitian once instructed that Shanghai was short of coal and authorized to relax restrictions on commercial transportation. The coal merchants reported for inspection. In order to speed up the process, it may have been the case that Zou Junma paid fees. The court then asked Zou Jidao about the photos of various checks seized by the Municipal Government. According to the testimony, one check for 74 million yuan was collected by Miao Suizi on behalf of Yang's salary. The other checks were for the sale of five loads of coal balls entrusted by Miao Shouzi, Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, and Ren Hui, and he denied soliciting bribes from coal merchants.

Knowing it was a Bribe, We Understood Each Other Without Speaking

The court summoned Chen Renshou, an intelligence officer of a certain bureau who worked in the committee. Chen said that according to the investigation, coal merchants transported coal, and Zhang Ren, the Customs Broker of Zhang Jinji, collected handling fees on their behalf, losing 20,000 to 80,000 yuan per ton. Afterwards, there was a continuous increase. On August 17, Zou paid him 42 million yuan in the name of discount interest. On August 22, he received 14 gold yuan. On September 6, he received 25 yuan and four cents in gold yuan. At that time, because he did not want to expose his identity, he did not ask about the source of each payment. After receiving the money, he submitted it to the Municipal Government. Other colleagues also received the same amount of money. They may have known that it was a bribe, and they understood each other without speaking. Subsequently, coal merchants Zhou Xinghuang, Huang Yuncheng, Pan Zongli, Xu Shouchen, Ge Jianhua, and Chen Songshou successively responded and said that they had paid money to Zhang Jinji Customs Brokerage as Zou Jidao's travel expenses, with varying amounts. Zhang Tiancai was asked, and he did not deny it.

Distributing Coal According to Three Standards

The court then interrogated Sun Jice and others about soliciting bribes from merchants for applying for coal distribution during their tenure in the office, or reselling the remaining coal on the black market and dividing the profits. Han Chengxun, who supplied black market coal, said that most of the black market coal was provided by the shipping company's remaining coal stack list and had nothing to do with the Fuel Management Committee. Sun Jice argued that the coal distribution to the shipping company was based on the following standards: (1) Jianghai ships, according to their voyage and tonnage, were allocated more than 28,000 tons per month, including the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; (2) Inland river ships, about dozens of companies, were allocated more than 1,000 tons per month; (3) Tugboats and barges, about a dozen companies, were allocated hundreds of tons per month. The shipping company managed by He Zhiying and others was handled according to the old case. After the application for investigation, the verification and distribution were carried out, and there was no over-distribution, first 475 tons, and later changed to 375 tons, and he did not admit to sharing the difference between the market price and the black market price. Han Chengpu testified that He Zhiying and Jian Ping and others had sent bribes, but he knew but did not know the details. Sun Zhigang, a clerk of Jiangzhe Shipping Company, admitted that he had been ordered to purchase gifts, foreign wine, and cigarettes for Sun and Lin during the Chinese New Year's Eve and Dragon Boat Festival last year, but he denied sending bribes. Finally, Shen Jinfu of Shenjiang Shipping Bureau, Cheng Yuguang of Detai, Yan Azhang of Yuanfu, Shen Tieyin of Puyi, and Li Huaqing of Huada were interrogated, and they all testified about the situation of the shipping company entrusting Han Chengpu to resell the remaining coal on the black market. The court ordered a retrial because there were still some important witnesses who could not attend, and the defendants were returned to prison. The court adjourned at about 6 p.m.

### To Solve the Coal Shortage of Public Utilities, Please Establish a Sound Allocation Mechanism

[Our newspaper's report] According to the Public Utilities Bureau, the Municipal Tobacco Coal Adjustment and Supply Office has drafted a new adjustment allocation price calculation method at the request of miners, and submitted it to the Central Committee for approval before implementation. In order to solve the coal shortage, the Public Utilities Bureau recently convened the persons in charge of public utility companies to discuss solutions. It is planned that each company will directly order from the miners, but the company finds that transportation is difficult and a specialized institution is needed to be responsible for handling the matter. Therefore, it was decided to telegraph the Central Committee to immediately establish a sound allocation mechanism, and set up coal yards for contingency needs.

### Supplementary Measures to Stabilize the Value of the Gold Yuan, Continued from Page Two

(2) The government should immediately formulate and announce a concrete fiscal plan to balance revenue and expenditure, in order to eliminate the people's doubts about the expansion of the new currency.

(Explanation) If the people still have the terror of continued expansion of the gold yuan, the currency value cannot be maintained. If there is no way to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, the terror cannot be eliminated. According to the reports of the financial officers in charge, the military and political expenditures from July to the end of this year (the numbers have been reported by the Minister of Finance in the first secret meeting of this session) are less than the US aid. At best, the financial burden is only a special wartime expenditure. However, since January, Hong Kong telegraphic transfers have been heard to have a black market, and prices have also fluctuated in various parts of the country. Although the government has used strong controls, the issue of high or low prices has become a matter of the quantity of materials. If no measures are taken to improve the situation, it may become a matter of whether or not there are materials. The biggest reason is that the fiscal balance of revenue and expenditure has not been made known to the public, and the public's terror of issuing expansion has not been eliminated. The short-term finances can be easily balanced by US aid, and it can be clearly announced that the revenue and expenditure have been balanced and that there are reasonable plans for the future, so that the whole country knows that the currency credit is easy to establish and the currency value is stable, which should not be difficult.

(3) The issuance reserve fund and the gold, silver, and foreign currencies collected after August 19 should all be concentrated for planned use, to control the materials necessary for people's livelihood, sell them in different regions to maintain production, supply civil use, stabilize prices, and consolidate the currency value. (Explanation) Since the gold yuan is a managed currency, its currency value and credit are not expressed by the reserves of gold, silver, and foreign exchange in the idle vaults, but by whether or not it can purchase the required goods at stable prices for a long time. If it can be done, even if there is no reserve, the people will regard this currency as a treasure and trust it with peace of mind. If it cannot be done, even if there are sufficient gold, silver, and foreign exchange reserves for issuance in the vault, the people will definitely think that it has nothing to do with the currency value and currency credit. This is very simple and does not need to be repeated. According to the customs statistics before the war, the total value of imported materials each year was 300 million US dollars. With the current depreciation of the US dollar at less than 50%, and the types of goods we need are more than before, our currency value should start from the areas that have not been lost, and the control of materials should be limited to daily necessities. It is estimated that the annual requirement should not be more than 300 million US dollars. If the existing US aid materials are not reordered, the purchase price of those that need to be ordered within one year must be far below 300 million US dollars. If the government instructs the Central Bank and the Issuance Supervisory Committee to use the reserve fund to order raw materials or finished products of daily necessities abroad, together with US aid, they will be sold by Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, Dianqing, Kunming and other ports to Gudi factories and counties and cities. Then, a standard retail price will be set for each region. This control has something to manage, not just people. The prices of imported goods and factory products will no longer fluctuate, and the currency value will be stabilized. Then, the Central Bank will use the gold yuan obtained from the sale to purchase export goods and encourage exporters to work together. The foreign exchange obtained from the export goods will be used to order import goods, then the prices in various places can be stabilized for a long time, and the currency value will be consolidated. At the same time, because the prices are stable, the export goods will definitely increase sharply. It is deeply believed that the foreign exchange that the country can control will also increase, which will greatly help the currency value and currency credit. Stop issuing five-cent silver coins, and all corner coins below one yuan are made of nickel, and the corner coins below one corner are made of copper.

(Explanation) The previous article has explained that the maintenance of the currency value and currency credit of the gold yuan is not in the existence of the reserve fund. According to this, it is not in whether the coins are made of gold and silver. It is even more impossible to be superstitious that the silver coins are redeemed, which is always a tool for stabilizing the currency value. Now that gold, silver, and foreign exchange are owned by the state, if they are redeemed again, whether they are gold, silver, or foreign exchange, they will conflict with the statement of state-owned. If the people's view of valuing gold and silver and despising paper money cannot be completely changed by the method of stabilizing prices with abundant materials, then no matter how many silver coins there are, they will definitely be quickly redeemed. How can the country have such a large amount of silver for coping? Once redeemed, what will be done to deal with the aftermath? Moreover, the silver content of the current silver coins has been reduced to several tenths of that contained in the original silver dollar, which is tantamount to telling the whole country that today's gold yuan can only be equal to several tenths of a silver dollar. The treatment of officials and soldiers is already disappointing according to the calculations before the war, and it is even more criticized for the discount payment before the war. Those who want to stabilize the currency value with silver will actually accelerate its devaluation. This kind of silver coin method, which contradicts the state-owned policy of silver and devalues the currency, is absolutely unfeasible.

(B) Regarding Increase in Producers

(1) Stipulate the method of offsetting capital by converting all assets of production businesses before the change of system into gold yuan.

(Explanation) Before the war, the capital of production businesses was more than 10 million for large businesses and tens of thousands for small businesses. Since the Anti-Japanese War, the currency value has gradually declined, and the funds of production businesses have gradually increased, but most of them are tens of millions of legal currencies, as many as hundreds of millions, and only a very few are calculated in hundreds of billions. The fixed assets of production businesses account for a large amount of funds, and their current assets have long since disappeared due to the depreciation of currency over the years. When borrowing current assets before the change of system, state-owned banks and commercial banks often refused to borrow due to insufficient capital or too much debt. If the capital of the current production business before the change of system is 1 billion legal currencies (in fact, very few reach this number), the combined gold yuan is only more than 300 yuan, which is not enough to be a business, and it is impossible to be fair to the original investors, and it is even more difficult to collect new capital. It is planned to reasonably convert the fixed assets before the change of system into gold yuan as its existing capital, and then order it to raise a part of the cash as current assets, so that all production businesses have the possibility of continuing to operate.

(2) The government should formulate various methods related to advocating and maintaining production businesses to develop production, improve people's livelihood, and cultivate tax sources.

(Explanation) The growth of various production businesses will naturally benefit the finances in the end, but before they grow, they must first be helped and advocated to promote their success. They must not affect the survival of the business because of the pursuit of temporary financial benefits (and sometimes it does not prevent a little expenditure). Therefore, it is a fundamental plan to formulate methods to advocate and maintain production businesses during the change of system. The principles are: 1. Stipulate the financial financing methods of production businesses; 2. Stipulate the methods for the government to train and reserve technical personnel of production businesses; 3. Stipulate the methods for production businesses to guarantee capital and interest; 4. Stipulate the tax exemption and reduction methods for production businesses when expanding. In short, the government's reform of the currency system this time was planned in advance to be strict and rapid, so the measures are inevitably flawed, which is understandable. In the future, how to supplement and complete them to make the currency value and currency credit more consolidated, so as to maintain the interests of the entire nation, the comrades of this party have a duty to fulfill. Therefore, the above-mentioned supplementary methods are proposed based on the understanding of the foolishness. Whether they are appropriate, we respectfully await the public decision.

### Qingdao from a National Perspective

— Our Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 8th] In the current situation, this question has been urgently raised by people in Beijing, Shanghai, and the South who are concerned about the current situation. Its implications are quite complex, but broadly speaking, it can be divided into two aspects: one military and one economic, and involving international issues.

Having returned to Qingdao, I have made many observations, but there seems to be little that can be discussed. The Battle of Jinan directly affects the overall situation, but does not directly affect Qingdao. What can affect Qingdao is the overall situation, not Jinan. To say that people are calm is true. Extremely calm, observing the overall situation in calmness. To say that people are not calm refers to the economy. The black market is active, and the scale of its transactions is truly shocking to people in the South.

Smuggled Goods Occasionally Seized

As the war has evolved from battles of attrition to coordinated large-scale positional and logistical warfare, the consumption of supplies is also large-scale. Qingdao, like Yantai, occasionally seizes smuggled goods, mostly oil, surgical supplies, sulfur, nitrate, and raw materials for steelmaking, and even munitions. Qingdao plays a significant role in the smuggling of supplies. (On the other hand, American goods on which no taxes have been paid are appearing on the market, and some merchants are waiting for the arrival of a special fleet.) Political methods cannot escape economic principles. Wherever high prices prevail, supplies will flow, and this is a serious reality.

A large number of Chinese staff members in the U.S. military whose backgrounds are unclear have been dismissed in the past two weeks, and are on standby to be notified. From a purely military point of view, the usefulness of the Qingdao naval base can be assessed, but if the maintenance of the status quo in Qingdao is related to the U.S. military's ships and marines, this purely military assessment is clearly unreliable. If U.S. policy does not allow the use of national force against the rebel army of another country, and military strategy cannot keep up with political strategy, then the future situation will be difficult to predict, but it can be broadly assessed. The size of the Pacific Fleet or the special fleet that may be deployed is the same, and not particularly alarming. Its existing four hundred vehicles are sufficient to assist in the evacuation of all land personnel and expatriates within hours.

People from Jinan Talk About the "Jinan Battle"

A certain division of the New Army arrived here from Taiwan the day before yesterday and landed. The two divisions originally stationed here will also be newly equipped. Based on impressions gained from conversations with people from Jinan, the scale of the Battle of Jinan was only one-tenth of that of Weixian, and only a few buildings were destroyed. People from Shandong often express their grievances: the local militia's service is the same as that of the National Army, but the treatment is very different. The Japanese government stipulates that local militias who have rendered meritorious service in combat can be promoted to the National Army, which seems to encourage local militias on the surface, but is actually tantamount to wanting them to forever remain "hanging around." The local militias are unwilling to leave their homes and land, so the Battle of Weixian is a typical example. It is hoped that the central government will pay attention to Qingdao.

### Starving Deaths in September, Relief Unknown in October: Gong Xuesui Reprimanded

Residents of the peninsula are more concerned with the price and availability of flour than with the merits and demerits of such issues. Mayor Gong Xuesui once became the target of public criticism because, after price controls were implemented, the city could not obtain food, citizens went hungry, and cries of distress were heard everywhere, while public and private grain reserves in warehouses totaled no less than a million bags. The allocation was delayed for a month, and the inspection of warehouses was more bark than bite. The authorities vowed that they would definitely not sell to wealthy families or military capital, and this was also promoted for a month. After starving, the anger erupted, during which the authorities suddenly sold 5,000 bags to the market, creating a buying frenzy, which fell into the hands of black market grain dealers. Dagu Road was crowded with people, some suffering head injuries and bloodshed. Gong Xuesui then allocated 300 bags of flour to the Huaxin Yarn Factory for sizing purposes, creating further controversy, and the public uproar was loud. A group of senators prepared to confront Gong Xuesui, but Gong was clever, admitting his absurdity and saying that it was because he was too busy and made a mistake, and agreed with all kinds of opinions, both positive and negative, leaving the group of senators both amused and frustrated. It turned into a bureaucratic interlude.

But the problem has not been resolved. Mr. O'Auer, representative of the Qingdao office of the ECA China Division, also raised a series of questions to Gong, arguing that the allocation for September should not be delayed until October, saying, "People who starved to death in September cannot be saved in October." Forty percent of the 360,000 bags of flour allocated in Qingdao came from the ECA, and the owner was very serious, so some awkward situations arose.

Situation of "Counting Rice for Cooking"

Furthermore, the allocation is only 15 catties per person per month, which is definitely not enough to eat, and the remaining grain must be sought on the scary black market. These two days, warehouses are being inspected, and over 400,000 bags have been found. It is said that they will be sold at the controlled price to compensate for the insufficient 15-catty allocation, but whether they will be sold by stores or allocated by the Residents' Survey Committee is still under consideration. However, these flour can only supply one month's needs, and problems will arise next month. Grain merchants usually regard September and October as peak seasons for purchasing to prepare for the winter, but this year they have hesitated to move forward unless the government can guarantee their profits. Whether it is possible to purchase at the controlled price in the South is also a problem. The black market price of rice is five times higher than in Shanghai, truly reaching the point of counting rice for cooking.

1,500 tons of rice are going to fly to the Northeast. The situation is gradually shifting south, and grain from Shenyang is to be transported from Qingdao, a flight of just over two hours, passing over the Bohai Strait and the skies of Dalian and Lushun. It will take more than a month to transport 1,500 tons of rice. A few CAT planes shuttle back and forth, which is like child's play compared to the Berlin airlift, so the news of Soviet planes demonstrating is nothing more than that.

Military and political requirements are contradictory, whether to stay away or get closer, but what is the guiding principle? This is a terrible question.

### Opening of the Shuijiahe-Hefei Section of the Huainan Railway

— Our Reporter Bao Baiping

[Our Hefei Dispatch, 11th] While the Jianghuai Plain is enjoying the autumn harvest and banditry is rampant on the edge of Anhui, the 70-kilometer Shuijiahe-Hefei section of the Huainan Railway has officially reopened. This marks the completion of the first phase of the railway's main line restoration project. It is good news for Hefei, which becomes an isolated city in rainy weather, and also marks the beginning of rapid coal transportation to support the power of the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

Speaking of the Huainan Railway, one cannot help but feel a sense of vicissitudes. It starts from Tianjiaan on the south bank of the Huai River, passes through the Datong and Jiulonggang mining areas, as well as Shuijiahe, Hefei, Chaoxian, and reaches Yuxi, which belongs to He County, opposite Wuhu, for a total length of 214 kilometers. During the pre-war survey of the Huainan mining area, it was determined that the coal produced there had to be transported by the Huai River waterway to Bengbu, and then transferred by the Jinpu Railway to Pukou, which was slow and costly. Therefore, the Huainan Railway was built to connect Jianghuai, facilitate coal transportation, and develop transportation in northern and central Anhui, and connect southern Anhui. Surveying began in the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic, the entire line was completed at the end of the 24th year, and it officially opened to traffic in January of the 25th year. The following year, the War of Resistance began, and the road was first destroyed by the "scorched earth" policy, and then dismantled by the Japanese. After the victory, only the bare roadbed remained. Now, the restoration, except for the roadbed not needing to be rebuilt, is the same as building a new one.

During the Japanese occupation, the Huainan mine was dug up in a mess. After the takeover, the Mineral Railway Company devoted most of its efforts to reorganizing the coal mine. In addition, steel rails, sleepers, and wagons all required money, and all became problems because the company had no money. The road was thus put on hold in everyone's anxious anticipation. The section from Shuijiahe to Bengbu, 60 kilometers, was originally built by the Japanese by dismantling the main line from Shuijiahe to Yuxi during the occupation. It was then severely damaged by bandits after the victory. Director Wu Jingqing of the Railway Bureau reported at the Double Tenth Festival opening ceremony of the Shuijiahe-Hefei section that in November of the 34th year, they only took over 27 kilometers of railway from Tianjiaan to Shuijiahe from the Japanese, three dilapidated stations, an unfinished machine shop, and 300 dilapidated vehicles. In addition, he only brought a national flag and two or three takeover personnel. Under such circumstances, he became the director of the Huainan Railway Bureau. At that time, there were countless tasks and countless problems. However, coal transportation, military transportation, and cargo transportation all required roads, so they began to repair the Shuijiahe-Bengbu section, which started construction in the spring of the 35th year and opened to traffic on June 1st. However, due to the Japanese' hasty construction, the roadbed and bridge culvert engineering were substandard, and driving was dangerous, making it impossible to make full use of it. In the winter of the same year, when the water was low, a plan was made to improve it, adding revetments, adding ballast, and strengthening the bridge revetments and fortifications. This is how the road between Shuijiahe and Bengbu was improved and no longer made people worry all day long. Although coal was transported to Bengbu and transferred to the Jinpu Railway for distribution to the north and south, the mineral railway itself suffered deep depression. It is said that the freight paid to the Jinpu Railway for transporting coal to Pukou was quite expensive, and the coordination of wagon scheduling with the Jinpu Railway's driving time also resulted in irreparable waste. Furthermore, it took three days for a wagon to complete a round trip from the mine to Pukou, while it took only twelve hours on the Shuijiahe-Yuxi section, resulting in an efficiency ratio of six to one. These many problems plagued the Mining Bureau and made them feel very aggrieved. Therefore, the restoration of the Shuijiahe-Yuxi section was an extremely urgent need for them, and needless to say for transportation between Jianghuai.

This year, on the Double Tenth Festival, black smoke filled the clear sky outside Hefei East. Locomotive No. 109 pulled first, second, and third-class passenger cars and came like a long reptile. For a full eleven years, this serious and far-reaching monster reappeared in the eyes of the people of Hefei. Everyone who heard the whistle was equally excited and happy. The train they had been looking forward to had finally arrived!

The damage to the roadbed and bridges on the Shuijiahe-Hefei section was even worse than that on the Hefei-Yuxi section. Before the restoration, preliminary surveying and mapping work was completed in the spring of the 35th year, followed by a review in December of the following year, averaging three kilometers of measurement per day, and completed on January 24th of this year. Immediately after, bridge repairs began, which was equivalent to two projects, because Shuijiahe-Hefei traffic had been maintained by cars on the railway base since the victory until recently. The bridge repair still did not interrupt traffic. Every time a bridge was repaired, a temporary bridge had to be built next to it to allow cars to pass. There were a total of six large bridges in this section, with a length of 221.986 meters, and eleven small bridges, with a length of 53.845 meters. In order to facilitate irrigation for the farmland on both sides, 37 culverts were added. The bridge work was not completed until July of this year. In addition, due to the long-term use of cars on the roadbed, which had not been repaired, the ballast penetrated deep into the roadbed, the road surface was uneven, and the side slopes had collapsed. The renovation and sorting began on July 22nd.

All projects were designed according to the Middle China Republic railway construction standards and regulations established by the Jiangneng Ministry. The roadbed was handled according to the Class B railway regulations of the standard, with a minimum radius of curvature of four degrees, a maximum slope of one percent, a straight embankment width of five meters, and a cut width of 4.5 meters. The track used 37 kg new rails, and the track gauge was the standard gauge of 1435 mm. The sleepers used 200 × 150 × 2440 American pine sleepers, with 1680 sleepers laid per kilometer on the main line. The steel rails were generally staggered on the main line, and flat joints were used in the station. The important turnouts in the station were all No. 10, and the secondary turnout lines used No. 8 turnouts. The effective length of the station tracks was set at 460 meters, and the center spacing between the tracks was mostly 4.5 meters. The ballast thickness was 0.15 meters below the sleeper surface. Under such design standards, the track laying project began on July 20th.

In the hot summer sun, the mercury column on the thermometer often fluctuated between 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In order to repair this section of the road, more than 400 employees were sweating all day long, and sometimes they were injured and bled. Every small stone, every steel rail, every sleeper, and every fifth electric pole had been touched by their sweaty and bloody hands. Not counting washing off blood and sweat, sometimes diseases would attack them, but they forged ahead without slackening, and arranged 5,580 metric tons of steel rails, 131,000 sleepers, 166 metric tons of track spikes, 32 metric tons of screws, 13,300 fishplates, 33 turnouts, and 1,420 electric poles in their respective positions on the 70-kilometer roadbed. Only then was the task completed. At noon on September 22nd, these railway heroes, who advanced one and a half kilometers every day, arrived at the Hefei Station central line, six hours ahead of schedule.

During the opening ceremony, Director Wu recounted the construction process in detail, and specially pointed out the names of the personnel who participated in the track laying project. He named a total of 15 people, including Chief Engineer and Director of the Engineering Department Li Jinghui, Deputy Director and Chief of the Engineering Section Wu Yan, Chief Engineer Lu Fengshan, Liu Xinmin, Deputy Engineer Wang Yongmin, Assistant Engineers Zhang Haoqing, Tang Taotong, Ao Rixin, Shao Kejian, Liu Bozhi, Chai Lantian, Zheng Chongci, Deputy Director of the Transportation Department Liu JIng, Deputy Director of the Shuijiahe-Hefei Transportation Section Han Zuoxin, and Transportation Inspector He Xian Guang. When these railway heroes appeared in front of the podium in response to their names, their faces were all tanned by the sun, showing the hard work of track laying. Director Wu said to them with a smile, "You are the most hardworking track layers. In the future, every passenger sitting in the train will definitely commemorate you!" Director Wu gave each of them a certificate of appreciation, which should be the price and comfort of their hard work. This is glorious!

The future goal is to repair the second phase of the project, the 68-kilometer Hefei-Chaoxian section. Although there are enough steel rails and sleepers, it is not yet known when it will be open to traffic because of the lack of funds. Cheng Wenxun, general manager of the Mining Railway Company, came from Shanghai to participate in the ceremony. According to him, the company's financial situation and the future of the road are not smooth. The Canadian US$15 million loan was tight for a while and then loose, but it was finally successful. Now, the payment of interest, repayment of principal, road restoration costs, and employee salaries are making the company feel like it is Chinese New Year's Eve every day. National railways still have government subsidies, but the coal price and ticket price of the Huainan Mining Company are also restricted. The main reason why the main line cannot be completed on weekdays is the lack of funds.

This Jianghuai bridge is the military, political, economic, and cultural artery of Anhui. We wish the Hefei-Yuxi project a smooth progress and hope that the railway will be restored on weekdays. We look forward to black smoke shooting into the sky everywhere on the Jianghuai Plain.

### Viewing Platform to Be Built on Chenghuang Mountain in Hangzhou

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 13th] It has been decided to rebuild the viewing platform on Chenghuang Mountain in Hangzhou. The cost is 7,000 gold yuan, and Chairman Chen has approved the construction.

### Coal Car Accident on the Lan-A Coal Road

— Fourteen Deaths and Injuries

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 11th] An unprecedented overturning accident occurred on the Lan-A Coal Road on the 9th, with 14 passengers injured or killed. In addition to three deaths at the Hanchang site, one died en route to the hospital, and another is in critical condition. A B.T.A. No. 7 small jeep of the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives Association was hired by Sun Daming, manager of the Jianhua Hosiery Factory in this city, to transport coal to Agan Town on the morning of the 9th. At about 10:00 am, it returned from the mining area. In addition to being fully loaded with coal, there were more than a dozen passengers. When it arrived at the Dashuizi section about five miles south of Agan Town, it happened to meet another truck coming from the north. When the two vehicles yielded to each other, the trade union vehicle drove to the side of the road. Unexpectedly, the roadbed was eroded by river water, and the soil was loose and soft. The vehicle overturned and fell to the riverside, with the four wheels facing the sky. The passengers were covered by coal and the vehicle body, resulting in 14 injuries and deaths. After the accident, the driver, Gao Yonglin, took the opportunity to escape. Several other passengers who were not seriously injured also left on their own. It was not until noon that the Agan Town Police Station discovered the accident and sent personnel to handle the aftermath. After investigation, it was found that there were seven seriously injured, four slightly injured, and three dead. The injured were taken to Agan Town Hospital for treatment, and one died en route. The driver of the accident was also apprehended in Agan Town and escorted to the Gaolan County Police Bureau. After interrogation on the 10th, the local procuratorate was notified to examine the corpses and bury them. The driver of the accident and the employer Sun Daming were transferred to the procuratorate on the 11th for interrogation. According to the person in charge of the trade union, the vehicle belonged to the Shandan Peili School. It recently came to Lanzhou from Shandan and was going to Chongqing to pick up equipment. The trade union and the school authorities were unaware of the vehicle going to Agan Town to transport coal. In order to understand the accident situation and handle the casualties, Guo Songmao, director of the trade union, rushed to Agan Town today.

### Dissatisfied with Airplane Ticket and Yarn Prices, Lanzhou Citizen Reports It: China Aviation Corporation Sends Letter to Special Criminal Court in Response

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 7th] Since the currency reform in Lanzhou, there have been quite a few merchants and citizens who have been reported or sent to the Special Criminal Court for violating economic control measures. On the 15th of last month, citizen Li Qianrang reported to the Lanzhou Higher Special Criminal Court that the ticket prices of Central and China Airlines had increased after "8/19" and requested a trial by law. The Special Criminal Court then informed the Lanzhou office of the two airlines to respond. The Lanzhou office of China Aviation Corporation copied the response to the head office, and the response letter was sent to Lanzhou a few days ago and submitted to the Special Criminal Court. These two documents are meaningful and interesting letters after the currency reform in Lanzhou. We will explore and record them below:

Special Criminal Court Letter to China Aviation Corporation

"According to the report submitted by citizen Li Qianrang on September 15th of this year: Regarding the increase in ticket prices of Central and China Airlines (according to the companies, the ticket prices were increased by 85% on August 20th, as evidenced by various newspapers), your court should have heard about it. It seems that your court cannot sit idly by and not intervene in such a case of disrupting laws and disrupting finances. It is hoped that you will quickly report and punish according to law in order to maintain the national law. After investigation, the various points mentioned by the citizen are not without cause, and this court has a strong need to understand them. You are hereby requested to investigate and respond within three days of the receipt of this letter! To: Lanzhou Office of China Aviation Corporation. Court President Meng Zhaodong, Chief Prosecutor Peng Junzhi. September 22nd."

Response from China Aviation Corporation

"Regarding the letter from the Lanzhou Office of our company on September 23rd, copying the letter No. 78 from your court on September 22nd, stating that the current ticket price of our company has increased by 85% compared to "8/19," requesting a response, etc., our company's freight and passenger fares were approved for adjustment on August 4th. Due to the sharp rise in oil prices and the steep increase in flight costs, we jointly submitted a request to the Ministry of Transportation with Central Aviation Corporation on August 16th to re-approve the fare so as to maintain it. On August 18th, we received an order from the Ministry, approving an increase of 85% in accordance with the fare on August 4th. Our company immediately notified all stations on the same day to sell tickets at the new price from the 19th. The fare was approved and implemented before "8/19" and does not conflict with the management principles. In order to support the government's policy of stabilizing commodity prices, our company, at the cost of great sacrifice, has voluntarily suppressed the freight and mail rates to the original price on August 4th from August 27th, so as not to affect the cost of commercial goods. The above is the detailed process of our company's fare adjustment. The outside world may not understand it, leading to misunderstandings. We hereby list the whole story and request your investigation! To: Lanzhou Higher Special Criminal Court. China Aviation Corporation, September 30th."

### Western Wind Intensifies, Northern Geese Fly South: Bian City in State of War-Induced Tremors

— Our Reporter Wang Shoumei

[Our Dispatch from Kaifeng, 8th] It is precisely the time when osmanthus flowers fill the air with fragrance, but Kaifeng has spent half a month in a sorrowful state amidst chilling winds and bitter rain. While over 200,000 citizens struggle to survive in darkness, dampness, mud, and rot, everyone curses the annoying patter of rain, raising their heads to ask the heavens, "Will there never be a sunny day?" As long as the sky clears, the warmth of the autumn sun will return to the world. Food and firewood from the countryside will flow in steadily, and all newborn hope will shine again in the hearts of these over 200,000 citizens. Everyone is waiting with unbearable anticipation.

The sky finally cleared, clearing so beautifully that there wasn't a single cloud in the azure sky. The tender and warm sunlight shone gently on the autumn fields and city, just like in previous years. But unfortunately, this clear weather did not bring warmth to the people, nor did it bring them new life and hope. Food and firewood from the countryside did not flow in steadily as everyone had imagined. Oil, salt, and vegetables could not be bought in the market. This place remains a city of hunger. The heavy and melancholic mood of the people has not been melted by the lonely sunshine. On the contrary, because the western wind is intensifying and the northern geese are flying south, the threat of the season and the current situation has caused everyone to begin another round of trembling.

Although the weather after the clearing is indeed crisp and refreshing in autumn, the scattered flowers and fallen leaves, the desolate atmosphere, are just like the terror of war, spreading throughout this city of fear.

These past few days, the streets have been filled with rickshaws carrying luggage concentrated towards the station. The station is bustling and overcrowded, making it difficult to move. Many people, fearing they won't be able to catch the train, load their wives, children, and luggage onto the open cars without canopies the day before, waiting in the deep cold dew, crying from hunger and cold, for the train to depart at dawn. When dawn breaks, the people who arrive later scramble onto the train, piling people on top of people and goods on top of goods. A broken locomotive pulls over thirty cars, each section resembling Mount Tai and the Big Dipper. People are on the smokestack of the engine, people are on the hooks, people are on the footboards, and people are hanging outside the carriages. The train moves as slowly as an ox. These northern geese, flying south because of the intensified rumors, will have to endure being blown by the wind and soaked by the dew for three to five days and nights before they can reach Jiangnan. But they are not afraid of such suffering and hardship. In reality, there is not a single sign of trouble around Kaifeng. The main force of the Liu bandits is still being blocked by the powerful National Army in the area west of the Pinghan Railway, including Xiang, Jia, Ye, Fang, and Wu. The main force of the Chen bandits, after capturing Jinan, is still stationed around Yingzhong without making any moves. Except for a small number of local communists who are being wiped out by the National Army, there are no bandit troops worth worrying about in the eastern Henan and Si areas. Moreover, Kaifeng is guarded by the famous iron army generals Liu Ruming and Liu Ruzhen, yet it is actually in a state of turmoil and unease. People are generally rumored that Zheng and Bian will be sacrificed for Xuzhou when necessary. This rumor is like a wind blowing through an empty valley, but no one is stopping its spread. The speed at which this rumor is spreading is accelerating. Today, all the newspapers in the city published a message from the Yellow River News Agency saying: "According to relevant sources from the Longhai Railway Bureau, the bureau has received an order from the Ministry of Communications that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Beijing-Shanghai railways urgently need a large number of passenger and freight vehicles. For the convenience of passenger and freight transportation, the bureau will soon transfer more than 200 red express freight cars (numbers 303 and 304) and more than 20 ordinary passenger cars to Jiangnan, and some officials will also go with the cars to provide services." As a result, people are even more uneasy. Everyone is worried that there will still be open cars to ride. If they delay any longer, they fear that even open cars will be gone, and they won't be able to leave even if they want to.

Here, the rain has stopped, but the azure sky, yellow flowers, and autumn scenery cannot captivate people because the western wind is intensifying, and the northern geese are making preparations to fly south.

### Large Oilfield Discovered in Longquan Mountain Area, Western Sichuan

— Our Reporter Zhou Xueduan

[Our Dispatch from Chengdu, 11th] Sichuan is known as the "Land of Abundance," but although it has abundant reserves of petroleum, a national defense resource, no major discoveries have been made until now. Recently, after several years of investigation by the Resources Commission, an unprecedented large oilfield has been discovered in the Longquan Mountain area, 50 li from Chengdu, the gateway to western Sichuan. The oil quality is excellent, and the reserves are abundant. In terms of national defense value, it far surpasses the Yumen Oilfield in Gansu. This is truly the most gratifying stimulant amidst the active construction of the Great Southwest.

Oilfield Area

Longquan Mountain is located 50 li east of Chengdu. It is undulating and continuous, with dangerous and magnificent terrain. It is a strategic location for military strategists and a must-defend. It has always been the gateway to western Sichuan and the throat of Chengdu. In order to explore the discovery of this treasure, the reporter once visited and inspected the Laojun Pavilion on the summit of Longquan. According to He Diansheng, a geologist from the Resources Commission who presided over the survey: This is the top of the great anticline layer in western Sichuan. From here, it descends northward, passing through Jianyang, Jingtang Zhaojia Ferry, crossing the Tuojiang River, and reaching Zhongjiang Shiquanchang. To the south, it extends to Renshou Fenshuipu, with a total length of 120 kilometers. The oil deposits are mostly in the Jialingjiang limestone layer, in the shape of lentils, with a thickness of 30 to 40 meters in some places. The entire great anticline layer extends from northeast to southwest. There are also a few small synclinal and anticlinal layers on the east and west sides. In the past, the petroleum discovered in Sichuan was only in these few small anticlinal layers. This discovery of the great anticline layer shows that Sichuan does indeed have the most abundant petroleum resources.

Discovery Process

This discovery dates back to 1945 when geologist Xie Jiarong once conducted a survey of a section of Longquan Mountain and determined that it was the most ideal oil storage structure. Last winter, British geologist Martins Strante came to investigate the area and confirmed that it had extremely exploitable value. After returning to Beijing, he immediately suggested to the Resources Commission to conduct preliminary exploration. Chairman Weng Wenhao actively agreed and sent He Diansheng and others to Sichuan for detailed investigation and survey. After several months of work, it was discovered that the cross-section of this great anticline layer is a fan-shaped structure that has been strongly folded. A large amount of "natural gas" escapes from the fissures at the top. In the surface layers of Laochanggou and Guojiagou, various rock layers contain salt essence. Based on the principle of symbiosis of petroleum, natural gas, and salt, it is judged that the petroleum area of this great anticline layer is about 1,500 square kilometers. The reserves of petroleum and natural gas are about ten times that of Zigong, and the salt reserves may also be ten times that of the Ziliujing well area.

Exploration Plan

According to the opinions of the geologists in charge of the survey: The Yumen Oilfield in Gansu belongs to the Tertiary oil-producing area. The reserves are not very abundant, and transportation is extremely inconvenient. The Mineral Exploration Department of the Resources Commission has long been planning to explore and develop petroleum mines in Sichuan Province. Discoveries have been made in Jiangyou, Longchang, and Ziliujing, but the quality is not ideal because this area is mostly close to metamorphic rocks. Recently, the Sichuan Factory of Bingli Chemical Company discovered crude oil in a new stratum at a depth of 3,500 feet in a deep well drilled in Wutongqiao, but after analysis, the oil quality is also not very good. Only the new oil mine in the Longquan Mountain area may not only have the best quality in the Southwest but is also no less than any famous large oilfield in the country. This great discovery proves that Sichuan will have an unprecedented supply of national defense resources in the future and deserves to be called the "Land of Abundance." Now, the Resources Commission has decided to devote all its efforts to development. It plans to immediately start large-scale drilling projects, with a minimum depth of 2,000 meters below the Jialingjiang limestone layer, to find the oil-gas interface and then formally start mining. The people of Sichuan are now waiting with the most eager expectation for the implementation of this great project.

### Central Bank Decides on Five Measures to Strengthen the Collection of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currencies: Remote Rural Areas Can Use Communication Reporting Methods

[Our Dispatch] Since the government announced the extension of the deadline for the collection of gold, silver, and foreign currencies, the Central Bank, in order to strengthen the collection, in addition to entrusting state-owned banks and provincial banks in various places without branches to act as agents, recently invited responsible persons from state-owned banks and provincial banks to discuss technical issues. It has been decided that: (1) The provincial and municipal governments are requested to instruct the county governments to go down to the pao-chia (neighborhood) level to expand publicity and persuade the people to exchange as soon as possible within the deadline. (2) Remote rural areas where exchange is inconvenient can use communication reporting methods. The entrusted banks in various places can accept them and should provide a quick and concise response to facilitate delivery. (3) Communication reporting should be carried out in coordination with mobile collection, but mobile collection should only be carried out when necessary. (4) After the entrusted banks exchange gold, silver, and foreign currencies, they can immediately submit them to the nearest branch of the Central Bank, which will issue a certificate to facilitate submission. The Central Bank will also negotiate with the Ministry of Finance to apply for passports to expedite the process. (5) The gold, silver, and foreign currencies exchanged in various places should first be collected by the branches of the Central Bank and then remitted to the head office.

[Our Dispatch] From August 23 to October 9, the total amount of gold, silver, and foreign currencies collected by the Central Bank and its entrusted banks in this city is as follows: (1) Gold: 1,144,714 taels, 9 mace, 0 candareens, and 7 cash; (2) Silver: 963,128 taels, 2 fen, and 6 li; (3) Silver dollars: 3,668,473 yuan and 5 jiao; (4) Silver dimes: 3,847,860 coins (double dimes); (5) US dollars: 34,438,872 yuan, 8 jiao, and 9 fen; (6) Hong Kong dollars: 10,345,753 yuan, 1 jiao, and 7 fen; (7) Philippine pesos: 14,364 pesos, 1 jiao, and 5 centavos.

### Yarn Merchants Request Permission to Retain Inventory as They Are Temporarily Unwilling to Resell: Very Few Yarn Thrown by the China Textile Corporation Yesterday

After holding a meeting of directors and supervisors the day before yesterday afternoon, Tang Zhiliang, chairman of the Cotton Yarn Business Association, yesterday presented two points of opinion to the Supervisory Office: (1) Regarding the previous notification from the Bureau of Social Affairs to yarn merchants to sell their yarn to the replication industry, it is requested that permission be granted to temporarily retain it. Since the yarn merchants were ordered to stop trading in the market, their business has been at a standstill. In order to maintain their survival, the industry previously requested to conduct joint distribution, selling to two groups: one for shipping to other places and one for domestic sales, and also requested the factory to consider reducing the quantity of goods. However, this request has not yet been decided, and there is no way to follow a business plan. Currently, there is a portion of inventory, but once it is sold out, there will be no source. Then all the yarn stores will close down, and the problems of unemployment and commercial depression will be enough to affect the prosperity of the social economy. It is requested to maintain the minimum level of survival for the members. (2) As the joint distribution has not yet been implemented, and the industry has received purchase letters from the replication industry associations in three provinces and one city, as well as Hankou, Changsha, Nanchang, and other places, it is also requested to approve the shipping and sales methods as soon as possible so that they can be followed.

Yesterday, the China Textile Corporation threw 589 pieces of yarn as usual, totaling 46,918.1 gold yuan. The prices were 255 yuan for 6-count sub-sunlight yarn, 528 yuan for 10-count double-strand Lima yarn, 573 yuan for 15-count Fengnian yarn, 787 yuan for 32-count Yanghe yarn, 880 yuan for 40-count sunlight yarn, 990 yuan for 42-count double-strand Lima yarn, 1,010 yuan for 42-count double-strand Baoguang yarn, and 960 yuan for 42-count double-strand Caiqiu second-grade yarn.

In other news, the China Textile Corporation's sales of 20-count yarn on behalf of the fire-stricken households have recently been suspended because most of this batch of yarn can be shipped abroad and is welcomed by the Southeast Asian market. In this way, a large amount of cotton can be easily obtained. Therefore, the Central Bank is considering exporting the stored yarn. However, since the Central Bank stopped allocating yarn, the supply of 20-count yarn has suddenly become difficult. Many people are requesting the allocation to be reopened. It is heard that the Central Bank is planning to release a portion of the 60,000 bales in the short term to continue the allocation.

In other news, the cloth distributed by the Cotton Cloth Association on behalf of the Dyeing and Weaving Association will continue to be allocated this Friday. However, the number of pieces has not yet been determined.

In other news, the Cotton Textile Association of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui-Beijing-Shanghai area held the first joint yarn allocation of the sixth phase for private factories on the 12th and 13th of this month. A total of 1,025 pieces of 20-count cotton yarn were allocated. The total amount of yarn and cloth sold by each factory on its own was 15,024 bolts of cotton cloth, equivalent to 1,017 pieces of 20-count cotton yarn.

### Investigation and Registration Deadline Advanced

The Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association of this city, in order to assist the government in thoroughly implementing the price limit policy, was ordered to investigate the amount of yarn used by the cotton yarn replication industry in order to improve the supply of cotton yarn and make adjustments. The registration of this survey form was originally scheduled to end on the 15th of this month. Now the association has been notified by the Industrial Association that the Materials Adjustment Committee has decided to advance the deadline to the 14th of this month. All members should submit a list of the current monthly yarn usage and operating conditions to the association. Those who fail to submit it by the deadline will be deemed to have waived their rights.

### Export Control Commission Announces Recent Export Situation

According to the Export Control Commission, the export situation this week (October 2 to 8) is roughly the same as last week. Tung oil prices are rising in the producing areas, and the city's inventory is very scarce, with very few sales. Transactions are almost at a standstill, and exports are shrinking. However, foreign prices have improved due to the Export Control Commission raising the export price limit. The Shanghai FOB price for sales to the United States is still at US$0.185 per pound. According to a London telegram on the 8th, the British C&F price for bulk and barrel packaging has risen to 154 pounds and 162 pounds per ton, respectively. Calculated according to the city's prices, transactions are possible.

The pig bristle market is firm, and people are bullish. Foreign quotations are the same as last week, with Shanghai No. 17 FOB at US$2.45 per pound, and exports are also possible, but not enthusiastic. Tea is still mostly favored overseas. Black tea is popular in the United States and the Soviet Union, and green tea is popular in the Philippines. In mid-month, 9,000 boxes of He Tea will be shipped to the Soviet Union for debt repayment. However, domestic production is decreasing day by day, and the quality is deteriorating. In addition, Japanese tea has better quality and will soon compete in the sea

The raw silk market is sluggish, and there are very few transactions. D-grade raw silk FOB is US$0.28 per pound. In order to alleviate the difficulty of exporting raw silk materials, the Export Control Commission has agreed with the National Bank to continue to allocate 200 piculs of raw silk to assist silk weaving manufacturers in weaving silk fabrics to expand exports.

Domestic prices for feathers have changed little, but foreign quotations have fallen slightly. Gray duck feathers and white goose feathers FOB are priced at US$0.38 and US$0.48 per pound, respectively. According to the city

The foreign price of pig intestines is stable, with salted pig intestines FOB at US$0.18 per pair, but because domestic prices have risen, export profits have decreased slightly compared to last week.

### Tea, Taiwan Salt, and Mineral Sand Shipped to Japan in Batches for Barter

The Central Trust Bureau's barter trade with Japan will soon ship a large amount of materials. The first batch is tea and tinplate, totaling 2,000 tons, which will be shipped the day after tomorrow morning. The second batch is 8,000 tons of Taiwan salt, which will be shipped to Kobe, Japan, next Tuesday. The third batch is Hubei Dazhi mineral sand. The total amount of this mineral sand shipped to Japan for barter is 200,000 tons. As of the 10th of this month, a total of 80,000 tons have been shipped. Before the end of this month, there are plans to mobilize ten major shipping companies to ship another 75,000 tons. The remaining 40,000 tons will be shipped by the end of next month, one month ahead of the original schedule. Salt is the most needed material in Japan, and the government's policy is that our country's production is not surplus, so the amount shipped this year is very small. The 8,000 tons shipped next Tuesday will be the largest shipment in recent years. There may be another shipment of salt within the year.

### Very Few Rice Transactions as Market Is About to Be Cut Off: Rice Arrivals Sharply Reduced: Thriving Retail Sales in Shantou

Rice arrivals have been reduced to 136 shi (approx. 13,600kg), and there are very few transactions in the market. The North City's self-transported and self-sold rice accounts for 15 shi. Flour was not traded yesterday, and miscellaneous grain transactions were sluggish. Yesterday, the market only sold more than 30 bags of Poyang yellow soybeans, priced at 13 yuan and 8 jiao. Poyang black beans were traded according to the limit, and Poyang black sesame seeds were sold in dozens of bags, priced at 28 yuan. The remaining grains were not traded.

The cooking oil market was stagnant yesterday. Although the rush to buy various goods has eased in recent days, retail sales of cooking oil are thriving. The first batch of allocated oil has been distributed to retailers yesterday to meet the city's needs. However, the Taishi cooking oil reserves are exceptionally abundant, and citizens can avoid this unhealthy psychology.

### Optimistic Tea Market Exports

The colors of black and green tea have not been widely available for a long time since the production and inventory were both depleted. Yesterday, the market was also affected by autumn rain, and the sellers were almost completely hidden. The demand from various parties is strong, but transactions lack reality, and the situation has little fluctuation. The price is consistently firm.

According to people in the industry, several trading companies in the city are optimistic about the future of export materials, so they are increasing their export departments. Tea, in particular, is seeing a surge in new companies due to the strong overseas demand. They are seeking tea samples from their counterparts in order to gain an advantage.

### Sugar Slightly Soft

The free trading of sugar was still extremely sluggish yesterday, but people's sentiment has softened slightly. Lvhong Sugar Company accepted the entrustment of the Social Affairs Bureau to tender for 15,000 bags of Peruvian sugar. The industry's floating capital has an outlet, and some of those short on orders seem to be more willing to sell. However, the demand in this street is slightly weak, and the turnover is not strong. Twenty-second term sand white No. 45 car white refined sugar is not available in the market and has not been traded. Coarse sand and medium sand were slightly traded according to the limit, and the rest of the market was mediocre.

### Silk Production in Zhejiang Province Gradually Increasing

Zhejiang's climate and soil are most suitable for sericulture. Before the war, among the 76 counties and cities in the province, 58 counties produced silk. In more than 20 counties, sericulture was the main secondary industry for the people. There were more than one million sericulture households, with a mulberry planting area of more than 2.6 million mu. During the peak of the silk industry, the annual output was 900,000 dan of fresh cocoons, 30,000 dan of filature silk, 50,000 dan of native silk, and 2 million bolts of silk fabrics, accounting for one-third of the total national output. Before 1928, silk accounted for the largest share of China's export commodities, and Zhejiang's silk exports accounted for more than 30% of the national silk export volume. The abundance of its production can be imagined.

Mulberry trees are best planted near water, so the distribution of Zhejiang's silk is concentrated in the river and river areas. The most prosperous silk areas can be divided into three areas: the Qiantang River, the Cao'e River, and the area near Taihu Lake. The main districts and outputs are as follows:

The three counties of Wuxing, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou produce 150,000-200,000 dan of fresh cocoons annually. The two counties of Xiaoshan and Haining produce 100,000-150,000 dan. The three counties of Tongxiang, Zhuji, and Jiashan produce 50,000-100,000 dan. The eight counties of Changxing, Deqing, Haiyan, Yuhang, Pinghu, Chongde, Lin'an, and Xinchang produce 10,000-50,000 dan.

Among them, Wuxing, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Xiaoshan, and Haining account for about 70% of the total output of the province. Therefore, the focus of Zhejiang's sericulture is in the old Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou prefectures north of the Qiantang River and south of Taihu Lake.

There are two ways to dispose of the cocoons produced in each county: (1) selling them to new-style silk factories to produce filature silk, and (2) farmers using indigenous methods to spin native silk themselves. Before the development of filature silk, native silk was the main product of Zhejiang. During the peak period, the annual output was 30,000 dan of filature silk and 50,000 dan of native silk. Most of Zhejiang's raw silk was used for local silk weaving, and the annual export volume was about 20,000 dan, mainly to Europe and the United States, followed by Southeast Asia and other places.

During the war, all the silk areas in Zhejiang were devastated by the enemy and puppets. Most of the mulberry gardens were abandoned, and most of the silk factories and cocoon markets became ruins. Few breeding farms survived. In total, the loss of silk is estimated to be at least 50 million yuan, calculated in pre-war currency values. After the victory, the government urgently sought to revive the silk industry, and the silk industry has shown a slight recovery. According to statistics, in 1947, there were 474,936 sericulture households in the province, with 995,211 mu of mulberry gardens, producing 175,131 dan of fresh cocoons, about one-fifth of the pre-war output.

In 1948, the Provincial Sericulture Management and Improvement Agency made great efforts to promote and provide regional guidance to sericulture farmers in various places, jointly seeking the reproduction and increase of sericulture. The output in both spring and autumn increased, but the exact figures are still to be investigated and reported. Based on the estimated production of spring and autumn silkworm breeds and feeding harvests, it is estimated that 511,287 spring silkworm breeds and 300,000 local silkworm breeds were raised in the spring, with an average yield of 20 jin of fresh cocoons per breed, producing a total of 162,257 dan of fresh cocoons (this number is similar to the total number of 94,464 dan of fresh cocoons purchased by various spring cocoon purchasing manufacturers, indicating that the difference between the estimate and the actual output is not significant). During the autumn breeding season, 300,000 improved silkworm breeds were raised, and there were no local breeds. Because the harvest was slightly worse than in the spring, with each breed only yielding 15-20 jin of fresh cocoons, the total yield was about 50,000 dan of fresh cocoons. The annual output is estimated to be more than 212,000 dan, an increase of 25% compared to 1947.

### Promoting University Cooperation Among Nations: International Association of Universities to be Established; Exchange of Academic Ideas and Representation of Common Interests of Universities; My Representative Chen Yuan Reports on Participation in Preparatory Meeting

[Our Nanjing Office, 13th Dispatch] The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) convened an international university preparatory meeting in The Hague this August, to which all countries of the world were invited. China was represented by Professor Chen Yuan, who reported on the current state of university education in China. Mr. Chen recently reported the situation of the meeting to the Ministry of Education, with the following summary:

(1) The International University Preparatory Meeting, in order to promote cooperation among universities worldwide, decided to establish an International Association of Universities. Before the establishment of the Association, an interim committee was formed by the preparatory meeting, electing seven individuals to be responsible for the following tasks: A. Drafting an organizational plan for the Association to be submitted for adoption and implementation at the next inaugural general meeting. B. Establishing an International University Promotion Association as soon as possible to be responsible for promoting all work until the general meeting is convened. C. The scope of the Association should include not only universities but also other higher education institutions with equivalent status or nature, as well as schools above the specialized level. (2) Recognizing that universities worldwide, or specialized schools of equivalent status, lack a unified international liaison organization to exchange academic ideas, disseminate school information, promote opportunities for connection and cooperation, and represent the common and consistent interests of various schools, the Fifth Group of UNESCO suggested the establishment of an International University Promotion Committee. The highest authority of the promotion association would be one of three types: A. The association would be directly under UNESCO, with its funding borne by UNESCO. B. The association would be subordinate to other international higher education groups, such as the International Association of University Professors and Lecturers. C. The association would be directly supervised and directed by a conference representing universities worldwide. The Fifth Group reported that the promotion association should be the highest authority and not subordinate to UNESCO, as UNESCO itself cannot assume the responsibility of supervision and direction, but can only assist from the sidelines. As for other international higher education groups, they can only represent partial interests and are insufficient to assume this responsibility. Therefore, it was suggested to organize an International Association of Universities, organized with universities worldwide as the unit. (3) The organizational purpose of the International Association of Universities is to serve as a center for universities worldwide and specialized schools of equivalent status or nature to seek connection and cooperation, and to promote mutual understanding among nations. It will convene international or regional conferences to discuss various issues related to higher education, and investigate the consistent interests of universities in member countries. Important matters such as student health and welfare, university entrance qualifications and degree awarding, academic freedom, university financial overview, student selection standards, teaching methods and curriculum improvement will be appropriately improved. It will also supervise the University Promotion Committee, exercise the collection and dissemination of information and news about member universities, promote the exchange of professors and students among universities, encourage the establishment of scholarships, plan the allocation and exchange of teaching equipment, and promote the development of all member universities. After the establishment of the Promotion Association, the interim committee will convene a general meeting of members to report on the plan to establish the Association and the work of the Promotion Association. The date of the meeting is yet to be determined in consultation with UNESCO, approximately in August 1950. (4) Funding is a decisive factor in the establishment of the Association and the Promotion Association. It is generally believed that all expenses before the work of the interim committee and the Promotion Association begins, and before the Association is formally established, should be borne by UNESCO. After the establishment of the Association, member universities will pay annual fees, and the shortfall will be raised through donations or subsidies from other educational foundation committees. The total estimated cost is approximately US$100,000 per year.

### Chinese Asian Relations Association Elects Five Executive Directors

### Yangshe Town Experiments with Unified Administration of Politics and Education; School Protection Work Achieves Notable Results

[Our Wuxi Office] The principle of unified administration of politics and education is to use educational forces to guide local autonomy affairs, and to use autonomy to protect the achievements of education. Yangshe, a small town in Jiangyin County, is currently experimenting with this system and has achieved a preliminary scale. The town is now designated as a "Model Autonomous Region," and the host is both the town mayor and the principal of the central national school, Ms. Xia Yi, 48 years old, a graduate of the Education Department of the former Southeast University. Through a year of practical work, she has overcome obstacles from various parties and gained the support of students' parents and local public opinion. In terms of autonomous administration, rural hospitals are working hard on health care, and cooperatives such as sewing and water pumping serve the farmers, all of which have been established one after another. In terms of local education, the central school guides the schools in each district, adds night schools, eliminates commercial work, and constantly promotes progress. Electrical education is also increasingly used, with radios and film screenings widely available in each district. Recently, in order to cultivate technical talents, a junior vocational school has been surprisingly established this semester, gradually progressing, starting with the strict selection of teachers in order to improve teaching standards. Ms. Xia's spirit of "entering the people" has largely achieved initial success. It is reported that the town also hopes that sincere political scholars and workers will visit for observation or criticism.

### Changchun University Actively Prepares to Move to Tianjin; Sharp Decrease in Students in Changchun City, Various Schools Merged

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th Dispatch] Changchun University has decided to relocate, and preparations are actively underway. According to President Luo Yunping, more than 700 Changchun University students have arrived in Tianjin so far, and the number is expected to reach 1,200 in the near future. In addition to renting the old site of Juemin Middle School as the school buildings for the three colleges of Literature, Science, and Law, the Medical School has reached a cooperation agreement with the Rear Hospital of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, and classes are expected to begin formally on November 1st.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th Dispatch] Due to the impact of the war, citizens of Changchun City have been leaving for the south, and the number of students in primary and secondary schools has sharply decreased compared to before. According to a survey by the City Education Bureau last Wednesday, there are only 1,127 middle school students and approximately 10,000 primary school students in the city, both less than one-third of the number at the beginning of the semester. The number of teachers who have resigned is relatively small, approximately less than half. The various primary and secondary schools have now implemented mergers, and the Provincial Department of Education has decided to open social education demonstration areas with the remaining manpower to promote social education.

### Ministry of Communications Tennis Annual Tournament; Railway Bureau Returns to Shanghai in Triumph

The Third Annual Tennis Tournament of the Ministry of Communications and Railways was led by Director Li Zubing of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Communications to Shanghai in late September. The Railway Bureau won a narrow victory by eighteen to sixteen, as reported in various newspapers. Subsequently, on the 9th of this month, the Railway Bureau sent a team led by the director to Beijing for the return match. As a result, the Railway Bureau won again by twenty to twelve. It is reported that the Railway Bureau team returned to Shanghai in triumph by express train yesterday.

### Group C Table Tennis Elimination Tournament; Lingyun Swears to Fight Pudong

In the third Table Tennis League, four teams from two groups of Group C were selected. In the second elimination round, Pudong will face Lingyun. The match is scheduled to be held at the Jingwu General Association Table Tennis Room on Yokohama Bridge starting at 7:30 PM tonight (the 14th). The referees are Dai Yongquan and Chen Jimao, and the recorder is Li Longbiao.

Pudong is the leader of Group C, Division 2. They train seriously on weekdays and their table tennis skills are advancing rapidly. In particular, the left-handed young player Zhou Jianan is good at attacking and drawing. He is the proud foot of the veteran Chen Linsheng, and has the potential to surpass his master. Other players such as Zhang Jiliang and Han Dalun are also good at drawing. However, under the leadership of Hu Jiankun, the three young players of Lingyun are exceptionally brave. They won the runner-up in Group C, Division 1, and even stronger teams such as Luying Lv, Yinglian Black, and Chou Qing have been defeated by them. The winner of this match has the hope of winning the Group C championship, and the loser can only compete for the third place. At that time, Lingyun must be calm in the game and use softness to overcome hardness, otherwise it may be difficult to defeat Pudong's fierce momentum. The lineups of both sides are recorded below:

(Pudong) Han Xilin (Leader), Zhang Jiliang, Zhou Jianan, Han Dalun, Cai Xiuzhang

(Lingyun) Hu Jiankun (Leader), Wang Weirong, Hu Yangshu, Zhu Jieshang, Lu Chunlin

Also, the day before yesterday (the 12th) was originally the final match for the runner-up between the Jewish team and the Luying team in Group B. However, as that day was the Jewish annual Day of Atonement, all entertainment and banquets were stopped. The organizers specially approved the postponement to next Monday (the 18th), so neither side attended.

### Drunkard Falling from a Carriage

— Wu Yong

Zhuang Shida Sheng chapter: "When a drunk person falls from a carriage, though it is swift, they do not die. Their bones and joints are the same as others, but the harm they suffer is different. Their spirit is whole, and they are unaware of danger, unaware of tension. Death, life, fright, and fear do not enter their hearts. Therefore, they can move objects without being affected. They are preserved by wine, and are thus protected, let alone by heaven?" This means: a person, when drunk, "death, life, fright, and fear do not enter their hearts," so even if they fall from a swiftly moving carriage, they will not die.

We have heard of drunkards falling from escalators and falling soundly asleep. However, we have never conducted scientific experiments to verify the truth. In history, we have not read of Zhuangzi himself getting drunk and "repeatedly succeeding" in this way. However, if we interpret "their spirit is whole" as "not fearing danger" and "remaining calm," with the spirit not being distracted by external things, or if we interpret the "heaven" in "preserved by heaven" as the "heaven" in "innocence," then this two-thousand-year-old saying of "drunkard falling from a carriage and not dying" has found an example two thousand years later, thousands of miles away in New York.

It turns out that in New York City, a two-year-old child named Cannas Liebman accidentally fell from the window of a six-story building, landing on a patch of grass. He immediately stood up and staggered away, without any injuries. We may also remember that a few years ago, a plane crashed in the suburbs of Shanghai, destroying the aircraft and its passengers, but a small child was unharmed. The reason they didn't die was probably because they were calm and "death, life, fright, and fear did not enter their hearts." What would happen if these two children encountered the same situation thirty years later? By then, they would be worldly and experienced, and would inevitably be nervous and terrified. When they fell to the ground, they would likely shatter like a broken bowl. Hall Bauer, feeling this, made the following remarks:

According to the law, children must go to school and learn from adults. However, the law does not explicitly state that adults must learn from children. In fact, children's words and deeds have much to offer adults. After children grow up, few can maintain this calm spirit. Athletes in the sports world mostly still maintain this spirit. The reason they can become athletes is precisely for this reason. They can often remain calm during competitions, as if nothing is happening, so they can handle their opponents with ease. If a person has to fight against themselves while fighting against their opponent, their chances of winning are very small. When a person's mind is fearful and uneasy, they are fighting against themselves.

Even if people possess everything and reach a point where they no longer need to worry, they still inevitably worry as before. At this time, what they worry about is the possibility of losing all their wealth. It is said that more Americans die from nervous tension than from any other cause. And for many people, overeating is just a sign of inner unrest. This last sentence is similar to the Chinese saying "borrowing wine to drown sorrows."

The main point of this argument is to tell people not to be nervous, so as not to be fearful and uneasy when things happen. Looking at the recent panic buying of goods by people all over the country, their emotions are so panicked and tense that they have never been seen before. To say it calmly and quietly, it is indeed excessive. With everyone worrying like this, it is still the common people who suffer. It must be known that the more people value their own self-interest, the less likely they are to obtain it. The Bible's saying "Whoever does not value their own life will gain life" has a profound meaning.

There is an ancient Chinese saying: those who come after will view today as today views the past. This saying is certainly correct, but Carnegie has a more optimistic saying: today's sorrow will be tomorrow's sorrow, just as yesterday's sorrow is today's sorrow. It means that what people worry about often does not materialize. Therefore, today's general blind following of others, seeing others panic and imitating their panic, is a bit like a blind man riding a blind horse. Instead of doing this, it is certainly better to imitate the "drunkard falling from a carriage."

### Tianfanglou

— Qian Dacheng

Zhao Liewen of Yanghu built "Tianfanglou" in his later years when he lived in exile. It housed tens of thousands of volumes of books. During the Ding Chou Rebellion, his family sold them all for rice. At that time, I and my friend Cao Jusheng had a "Zegu Bookstore" in our hometown, so we also acquired several kinds. Qian Taiji's hand-annotated "Banma Zi Lei" has already been sold. Jusheng still has Liewen's hand-annotated Jiajing edition of Xue Hui's "Laozi Jijie." Zhao's collection of books all have the large "Tianfanglou" collection seal, as well as a long, rectangular collection seal with many characters, and each volume is stamped. Liewen also marked the volume numbers in red ink, even for common books, not just rare editions.

Liewen, whose courtesy name was Huifu and whose pseudonym was Nengjing Jushi, served in the staff of Zeng Guofan and his brother Guoquan for a very long time. His book "Nengjing Ju Diary" consists of fifty-four volumes (Mr. Chen Naigan's Zhao's Chronological Biography mistakenly states that there are sixty-four volumes. This spring, I met Liewen's grandson-in-law, Wang Jiyu, who said that there are only fifty-four volumes. Jiyu is proficient in cataloging and versionology, and his collection of books is also exquisite. He is now an editor at the National Central Library, so what he said should be accurate.) Among them, there are many anecdotes about the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Liewen even had a long conversation with Zhong Wang Li Xiucheng and felt quite sympathetic to Xiucheng, but he was very angry about the atrocities committed by the Qing army after entering Nanjing. He repeatedly advised Zeng Guofan to win back the hearts of the people, but Zeng did not listen. Liewen then left in anger. He was very respectful to Guofan, and Guofan also called the poems written by Liewen's close friends the best. After Guofan's death, he immediately returned south in pain. He purchased land in the west of Changshu and built "Jingpu," which was several tens of acres in size, with a five-room building, which was the so-called "Tianfanglou." He spent his days with friends from Yushan, such as Yang Haosou, Zhao Cihou, and Zeng Junbiao, entertaining himself with literature and wine. He died in the Gui-Si year of the Guangxu reign at the age of sixty-two. Liewen was also well-versed in epigraphy, and all the rubbings of bronzes and stone inscriptions he collected had his own postscripts, but they have now been scattered. Jingpu was purchased by the Sheng family of Wujin and given to the monk Zhikai of Tianzhang Temple, who renamed it "Ningjing Yunshe." The scenery of this garden has changed greatly, but only "Tianfanglou" still stands, but it has been transformed into a Buddhist hall.

Mr. Chen Naigan had an old relationship with the Zhao family and borrowed "Nengjing Ju Diary" for ten days, extracting the essentials and compiling a chronological biography. According to Mr. Wang Jiyu, the diary contains many anecdotes about Xunqing Hall. He once recorded that Grand Secretary Weng Wengong cried bitterly to Emperor Tongzhi because the emperor did not like learning. The emperor then used the sentence from the Analects "A gentleman is not a vessel," covering half of the word "vessel" to show Wengong. This is enough to show that the emperor was quite clever. There are many similar anecdotes. Unfortunately, the manuscript of the diary was also sold off by his descendants, and now it is unknown where it has gone. If a good person were to print it, it would rival the "Yuemantang Diary" and become a treasure trove of Qing Dynasty anecdotes.

In recent times, Mr. Jin Songcen also named his studio "Tianfanglou." Mr. Songcen also had the ambition to serve the world. Both of them grew old as scholars and never fulfilled their ambitions. Having talent without a position is also the fate of the world?

### Miscellaneous Poems from Yi Lou

— Shi Shufan

Night Tour of Wusong

Fleeing the din at midnight, intention already subtle, sharing with fish swallowing 　 forgetting to return, fireflies pierce white 　 cool 　 air, tide submerges yellow stars breaking stillness, the vast sea does not change with war, who cares about the ruined pass, who does not cherish planning? The wild man without a position sits here idly, tasting the scenery, looking at the sky, clothes full of dew.

Evening Observation of Rickshaw Pullers Gathering to Eat Cakes Outside the Alley

Evening wind cold, shadows of trees slant, wheat cakes along the street with clear tea, broken clothes need not levy cotton tax, scorched earth still a beautiful fire flower. Sitting watching green and yellow exchange years, faintly hearing that nineteen have no home, a full meal in Jiangnan is a great blessing, how can I bear to think of the grass buds in Guandong!

Double Ninth Festival

Fallen leaves, the spiritual banners passing faintly, Qing Qi, a strand connected to Luan River, climbing high, looking far, autumn is boundless, drinking wine for joy, not much land, yellow chrysanthemums can know the Lament for Ying, white clothes, do not sing the Crossing the River Song! Next year, few people, wormwood and weeds flourish, what will it be like when the Double Ninth comes again?

### No Eggs to Eat

— Du Yun

Some people admire the British for their thrift, each person eating only one egg a week, but unbeknownst to them, in Shanghai, there are no eggs to buy, 　　　　　　　　they are about to disappear.

According to people in the egg industry, they sincerely support the August 19th price limit and are willing to sell at the limit price, but after August 19th, some people have been raising prices step by step, searching and buying in the production areas. The net cost of each egg arriving in Shanghai has risen from five cents to one dime, and there is still a trend of continuous increase. With a cost of one dime and selling at six cents, there is no profit to be made and a loss must be taken. Who would be willing to do this business?

A certain gentleman went to Yangzhou to purchase eggs and only saw that the Yangzhou egg shops were closed during the day and the staff were sleeping, and began to operate late at night. Since August 19th, the local egg limit price has been 34 yuan per hundred catties, but because there are ice egg factories and soil egg factories setting up shops in the area to raise prices and search for eggs, each hundred catties of raw eggs is 62 yuan, plus an extra 2 catties. Calculating this, it exceeds the limit price by more than double. If they collect goods during the day, there will be a group of uniformed individuals who will purchase from the merchants at the limit price. If they don't approve it, they will be charged with the crime of hoarding and speculation. If they approve it, they will lose half of their capital. Therefore, they have no choice but to tell the egg vendors to secretly deliver the eggs to the shops in the middle of the night. As a result, everyone sleeps during the day and engages in the black market at night. Of course, from now on, Shanghainese will never be able to eat envious eggs again.

### Talking About Paper

— Ze Shi

The Chinese have an old saying: "Seven things to start the day: firewood, rice, oil, salt, 　　 tea." Now it is now, the seven things to start the day may have increased to seventy or decreased to three and a half. It seems that there is no definite thing to say, at least tobacco is already one of the several things to start the day, which was not the case in the past.

I don't know if the seven things to start the day are the same as what is now called daily necessities? If so, then today it is "six things to start the day: rice, noodles, oil, cloth, and paper." The authorities say so, the newspapers say so.

Thinking carefully, I feel that it is very inappropriate. Why are there no firewood or coal briquettes in daily necessities? Why is there paper - newsprint and coarse paper? "Try to ask a passerby", there is no one who does not use firewood in a day, there must be "all under heaven" who do not buy newsprint or even coarse paper in a year. Why is something used every day not included in daily necessities, and something not used even once a year included in daily necessities?

Is it because you and I read the newspaper every day that the newspaper has become a daily necessity? Regardless of the four or five million people in Shanghai, the best-selling newspaper only claims to sell 150,000 copies a day. Even if each person has one copy, if newspapers are to be included in daily necessities, they must also include ink, as well as our articles - I am wrong, articles have already been invisibly included in "daily necessities" - without increasing the manuscript fee.

Writing this, I read in the newspaper that the Social Affairs Bureau has decided on the purchase of paper according to the request of paper merchants: (1) those who have quotas, such as bookstores, must not buy paper from paper shops anymore; (2) out-of-towners cannot buy paper in Shanghai; (3) individuals can buy a maximum of five reams. May I ask, if I want to print a book but have no quota, what should I do? Also: individuals can buy five reams, but individuals have no use for newsprint. Allowing them to buy five reams is not encouraging scalpers and promoting hoarding of paper?

Strange, strange!

Exchange gold, exchange gold, exchange again and again, thousands of people, suddenly a "dou-sized golden seal" appears! This is the treasure that the descendants of Prince Yu of the Qing Dynasty, who are now widely rumored, asked the Central Bank of Peiping to exchange for gold yuan coupons.

The seals we usually see are mostly made of bronze, silver ones are rare, and gold ones are only heard of. During the imperial era, the emperor's seals had "Bao" and "　", and their quality was "gold" and "jade"; the prince's seal was called "Bao", and its quality was "gold"; the seals of first- and second-rank officials were called "Yin", and their quality was "silver"; only Shuntian Prefecture of the third rank used a silver seal, and other officials of the third rank and below in the capital and provinces used bronze seals; minor officials had both bronze and wood. Statistically, bronze was the most common and widespread, while gold and silver were relatively few. However, counting the various ministries and agencies in Kyoto, the various banners, and the governors, provincial treasurers, admirals, generals, and commanders-in-chief of the outer provinces, the number of silver seals was still considerable. Only gold ones were limited to 　 chambers and shrines, so they were the rarest and least sold. 　 Prince Yu was one of the meritorious nobles who entered the customs in the early Qing Dynasty. It has been hereditary for three hundred years, and this seal can be called an antique. Its palace was in the east of the city, and it was a large scale. It was sold to Westerners early in the Republic of China, and the descendants have declined. Now the family heirloom is being sold. The noble 　 of the past, the down-and-out descendants of the princes, the changes of the world are mostly like this. The seal is three inches and six points square and weighs 270 taels. After arriving at the bank, it was cut open and inspected, and more than 200 taels of pure gold were obtained, which could be exchanged for about 50,000 gold yuan coupons. The seller can afford to be warm and full, and the central bank's exchange is relatively large, which is a happy event. Suddenly, the Palace Museum heard about it and said that this was a precious object with historical value and should be moved to the museum for preservation, which is reasonable, but the seller's purpose is to exchange it for cash to make a living, and the bank that exchanges it is responsible for exchanging and buying gold, and doesn't care if it's precious. The positions of all parties are different, and the concepts are different, which is also an interesting twist.

"Yin" is a common name. Except for the "Bao" and "　" of emperors, the official seals of various yamen in the capital and provinces are square, in the various 　 of the internal ministries, in the two provincial treasurer offices of the outer provinces, transport envoys, and the newly added educational commissioners at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and even the prefects, magistrates, county magistrates, prefectural classics, and patrol inspectors, are all square, and their sizes are divided according to their ranks. A first-rank seal is about three inches and three points (per side), a second-rank seal is about three inches, a third-rank seal is two inches and seven or eight points, a fourth-rank seal is two inches and five points, and fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth-rank seals are reduced by several points in order, until the small seal of a ninth-rank patrol inspector, which is as small as Suzhou-style "five-spice dried tofu". However, the engraved characters are exquisite, so they are worth playing with. The so-called size is the official inch, which is only 80% of the old market inch, so this Prince Yu's seal (the original "Prince Yu of the Qing Dynasty He Shuobao" six characters) is named three inches and six points square, but it is actually only "two inches and eight points and eight li". I obtained a prefect's seal (fourth rank), which is named two inches and five points square, but it is actually only two inches.

There are many names for rectangular ones. Governors-general, governors, and educational administrators use them, and their inscription is "Guanfang" (because the governors-general and governors are officials of the Ministry of War and the Censorate who supervise the local area, and their hall seals are used jointly by the yamen in the capital and cannot be taken out of the capital, so a separate "Guanfang" is issued. In the Ming Dynasty, it was called "half seal". Educational administrators are also officials released from the capital, so they also only have "Guanfang" and no seal.) Next are the Taoist platforms, which are assistants to the two provincial treasurer offices. In the Ming Dynasty, the Taoist platforms all had the original street titles of participating political affairs of the provincial treasurer office, or deputy envoys and vice-prefectural title of the provincial inspectorate. Their seals are in the provincial capital and cannot be carried with them, so they also use "Guanfang", such as the Shanghai Taoist officials in the past, although they were large, had no seal, while the Shanghai county officials, although they were small, had a square seal. Next are the assistant administrators and registrars, who are assistants to the prefects. The prefect's yamen has a prefect's seal, while the assistant administrators and registrars use "Guanfang". The assistant miscellaneous officials in the counties and districts have wooden, bronze, square, and rectangular ones. For example, the registrar only uses a wood-carved "Lingji" (rectangular), commonly known as "wooden chop", which is made by official craftsmen in the provincial capital (bronze seals and Guanfang of all sizes are cast and issued by the Ministry of Rites in the capital). At the end of the Qing Dynasty, many new bureaus and schools were established in various provinces, mostly led by Taoist and prefectural officials, although they were fourth-rank officials, they used "Guanfang", but they were not substantive positions, and they were also "wooden chops", not eligible to receive the central seal.

The number of silver seals of the former Qing Dynasty, combined with the first- and second-rank officials of more than twenty provinces, was truly not small. Taking Jiangsu Province as an example, one governor-general, one governor, two provincial treasurer offices, one grain transport governor (later changed to Jiangbei admiral), and some generals, commanders-in-chief, deputy commanders-in-chief, naval admirals, and various town generals, already amounted to no less than twenty. Averaging two hundred taels of silver per seal, there were about four or five hundred seals nationwide. During the Xinhai Revolution, many were hidden far away with their seals, or were lost in exile. It is unknown where they have gone.
