### The Jidong Battle Has Not Yet Matured; Military Authorities Express Confidence in Overwhelming Victory; Nationalist Forces Recover Xianghe and Approach Baodi

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 27th] Yan Youwen, spokesperson for the North China Pacification Headquarters, said on the 26th that the battle in Miyun, Jidong, is not yet ripe. It cannot be predicted when the major battle will break out, whether it will be a mobile war or a fortified defense. It has been determined that the Northeast bandit troops entering the pass are the 4th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 11th Columns. The 8th, 9th, and 11th Columns are part of Cheng Zihua's bandit forces, which were dealt a heavy blow by the North China Nationalist forces in the autumn sweep. The 4th and 7th Columns were also defeated by the North China Nationalist forces in Jinxi Tashan recently. With the bandits' current strength, it seems that they are not sufficient to support a major battle.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 27th] The North China military authorities are extremely optimistic about the future Jidong battle. A high-ranking official declared that the Nationalist forces have at least a 95% chance of victory in this campaign. He also said that there are enough daily necessities in Beiping and Tianjin for half a year, and enough food for three months. After American aid arrives directly in North China, there will be no shortage of supplies.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 27th] The North China Pacification Headquarters announced: (1) The Nationalist forces in Jidong were stationed in Xianghe on the afternoon of the 26th. On the morning of the 27th, they cleared up scattered bandits in over 20 villages near Dawangzhuang and Hou Taogou, and have now crossed the Qukou Town, 30 li east of Xianghe. (2) The light cavalry unit of the Nationalist forces north of Tianjin is approaching Baodi. The Nationalist forces control an area of 200 li in length and width in Sanhe and Baodi.

[Our Tongxian Dispatch on the 27th] After General Shi Jue's powerful corps voluntarily withdrew from western Rehe, the posture of the Nationalist forces in northern Pingbei has been significantly strengthened. Tongxian has recently been teeming with soldiers, tanks, and machine guns and has formed an important base in northern Hebei. The people are calm, food prices are stable, and there are no bandits within 50 li east of the county due to the pressure of the Nationalist forces. The bandits in Xianghe, who had built a large wooden bridge at Wangjiaban, 70 li east of Tongxian, were blown up by the Nationalist forces on the 25th, and their attempt to cross the river and invade westward was crushed head-on.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch on the 27th] After the redeployment of the Nationalist forces in North China, the military value of the Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao areas has greatly decreased. It is learned that the local people have completed their evacuation.

It is reported that the bandit 2nd Column is fleeing back to Yixian, the 4th Column is entrenched in Dawangdian, and the 7th Column has retreated to the area north of Rongcheng.

### Sun Ke Talks About a Wartime Cabinet: Enlisting New People and Adopting a Layered Responsibility System; The Organization Plan Is Still Under Study and Approval

[Report from Our Newspaper] Sun Ke arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing again yesterday morning at about 7:00 AM to treat his foot ailment. According to Sun, he will return to Nanjing within days. Also, Mayor Wu visited Sun's residence yesterday morning. In the afternoon, Speaker Pan, Du Yuesheng, Zhao Zengjue, and others also visited. At about 4:00 PM in the afternoon, Sun met with visiting reporters at his private residence on Columbia Road and issued a statement, saying: "I was ordered by the President on the 25th to form a cabinet. I had not considered this beforehand and had no preparation at all, so the cabinet formation was entirely passive. Now, at a time when the situation is difficult, there must be a wartime cabinet organization to cope with the situation. Therefore, I am still waiting for the wartime cabinet organization plan to be finalized before I can take office. Wu Tiecheng has drafted the organization plan, which is still under study and approval. My personal view on the wartime cabinet is that it must enlist new people with experience, leadership ability, and responsibility. People from all factions within the Kuomintang will be invited to participate. It is hoped that they will abandon past grievances and work together to participate in politics. Whether the Minzhu and Qing parties will participate is still under negotiation between the two sides. It is hoped that after the number of people is concentrated, the accumulation of delays in handling affairs in the past can be swept away. At the same time, a layered responsibility system will be adopted. Major events will be discussed and decided collectively, while for routine matters, the various departments should make decisive decisions. A wartime cabinet must assume the responsibility of a responsible cabinet, so that it does not have to ask the President for instructions and decisions on everything. I have been out of executive office for seventeen years and have been a member of the Legislative Yuan for many years, so I am not interested in being the president of the Executive Yuan again. However, I cannot but reluctantly accept the President's firm invitation."

### Adopting US Suggestions; Agreeing to Open Up Inland Waterways

Sun then answered reporters' questions. The main points are as follows: (1) It is rumored that after the establishment of the wartime cabinet, the original ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan will be considered for abolition or merger. This matter has not yet been decided. (2) It is rumored that after the new Executive Yuan is formed, the Legislative and Control Yuans will be effectively suspended. This is also not true. (3) Shanghai's proposal to open up inland waterway navigation rights and reduce transportation costs was also supported by him. (4) Since there is a US military advisory group stationed in China, the suggestions of the group should be considered and adopted as much as possible. (5) The original organization of the Ministry of National Defense must be reformed, and the reform methods are currently being studied. (6) On the issue of US aid to China, the US itself has inconsistent opinions, but it is believed that the US will definitely aid China. (7) Improving the treatment of civil servants and teachers must be considered in conjunction with increasing the revenue of the national treasury in order to be effective. If the temporary property tax can be effectively implemented, it may be possible to increase tax revenue, and the treatment of civil servants and teachers can also be expected to increase accordingly. (8) What is the standard of the so-called "powerful families"? It is hoped that public opinion organs will provide as much input as possible for reference. (9) It is said that the government has lost public support. The government should be responsible for this. At the same time, it is hoped that the people will cooperate sincerely. If the government and the people can cooperate and become one, nothing is impossible. (10) After the implementation of martial law, there are quite a few restrictions on freedom of the press. This is inevitable in extraordinary times. (11) As for the overall war situation, I dare not make any rash judgments because I have not been in contact with all parties for a long time. (Sun Ke's personal opinions to American reporters are published on the second page)

### Current Educational Measures

— Zhou Shang

Generally, people are focused on military affairs. In reality, as long as the generals and commanders are committed and morale is high, the war situation can naturally turn from danger to safety. The most fundamental thing is to thoroughly clarify politics, rectify officialdom, clearly distinguish between rewards and punishments, promote the virtuous and eliminate the unworthy, then Chinese and foreigners will definitely look at our government with new eyes.

The big problems we currently face include education. The authorities should take clear and rapid measures. Now that the fire is burning our eyebrows, it would be too sad if we are still at a loss. The demon of "chaos" is eager to try during this transitional period. In the end, we will blame Zhang San and complain about Li Si, but in reality, this kind of "chaos" is forced out by improper measures. The exodus of students from the occupied areas, the borrowing of students returning from dangerous areas, the food for students in areas lacking food and fuel, the increase in fees or closure of private schools, the abnormal psychology of teachers and students, the public funding of normal school students, the treatment of teachers and staff, the arrangement of educational materials, the prevention of troops occupying school buildings, etc., should all be planned as a whole and prepared in advance. Do not dig a well when you are thirsty, and be at a loss!

This newspaper has already discussed the exodus of students from the occupied areas, calling for a quick and proper handling. Recently, students from Yantai have fled to Shanghai, increasing social unrest in Shanghai. This matter should be handled by the Ministry of Education with the assistance of local educational administrative organs, and should not put the cart before the horse. Although the Ministry of Education has sent personnel to Shanghai to take care of these students, they are hiding behind the scenes. Nanjing immediately received 15,000 refugee students, with the next generation covering the ground at the train station, crying for food, and they will inevitably keep coming. Suzhou also has more than 400 students from Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, and there is no way to solve their food, clothing and housing problems. Currently, the Jinghu line is in a state of emergency, how can refugee students be allowed to run around east and west? The educational authorities should urgently designate a relatively safe area, accommodate them as much as possible, and treat them well; this is an inescapable responsibility.

Furthermore, there are scattered refugee students who have individually entered corresponding schools, alone and without economic support. They have no relatives or friends, and even fewer acquaintances. As autumn ends and winter arrives, they stand shivering in tattered clothes during the day, and cannot sleep due to the cold at night. They are hungry and cold, and cry out without being heard. How can they continue? They are all our nation's children, the elite of the next generation. The authorities should also send clothes and quilts, and come up with practical relief measures. The Executive Yuan should provide quick assistance and should not go through unnecessary bureaucratic procedures when asking for money.

Near war zones or curfew zones, society is uneasy, people are restless, and people with sensitive nerves are fleeing with the old and young, causing disorder at train stations and docks. Naturally, schools also show signs of turmoil, teachers and staff are uneasy in their positions, and foreign students are returning to their home countries one after another. In this kind of situation, arrangements should be made for teachers and staff, even if there can't be a guarantee, there should be some comfort. Foreign female teachers who want to resign or take leave should be treated leniently, and it is fine to merge classes as student numbers decrease. For returning students, the "Borrowing Study Measures" promulgated during the War of Resistance against Japan should be imitated to avoid dropping out of school halfway and developing bad habits of idleness.

Over the past eighty days, the currency policy has been reformed, supplemented, and revised. In these three stages, panic buying was caused by price controls, and this panic buying created a food shortage, a firewood shortage, a vegetable shortage, an oil shortage, etc. This series of shortages has caused major problems with student meals. Many schools have gone from eating porridge to running out of food. The situation is very serious. Although it has passed now, self-funded students and publicly funded students are still facing great difficulties. The non-staple food allowance for publicly funded students has already increased by one and a half times, which is a drop in the bucket, and the order to increase this allowance has been slow to reach schools in various places. What will schools use to maintain themselves? It is naturally easy for the government to give official excuses, but the students' stomachs are a reality. It is best for students' meals to be rationed with food, and secondly, they should be appropriately increased with reference to the cost of living index. The central government's measures to increase fees must reach schools in various places at any time on the same day or in the shortest possible time, and the funds should be received and used immediately. Otherwise, the price will jump again before the fee increase arrives, which is not a long-term solution.

A portion of private schools are in a difficult situation to maintain today. In theory, the economic foundation of private schools is built on the board of directors, but most private school boards of directors are just a façade and are mostly "empty city schemes." The funds when registering are borrowed and deposited in the bank, and the inspectors clearly know it is a deception. The state is unable to universally establish schools and relies on private schools to maintain education. In this kind of situation, it only helps to fuel chaos. Schools run by selfish people and private groups should be distinguished from good schools. Please look at the good private schools that do not increase fees or suspend classes, which are worthy of praise and worthy of being models. When tuition fees were paid, they were paid at the price of 20 gold yuan per stone of rice. At that time, gold yuan was very valuable, and parents had exhausted their strength to pay fees for their children. How can they afford to increase fees now? Looking at educators such as Dong Zhongshu, Hu Yuan, Zhou Lianxi, Zhang Hengqu, and Gu Yanwu, how can we face them?

The issue of teacher treatment has been shouted from the time of victory until now. It was bad in the past, but it is even worse today. Many thanks to the enthusiastic senators and supervisors for speaking up for them, but the cry of injustice is still just a "cry" and does nothing to help the actual situation. The Ministry of Finance uses a starvation policy to treat teachers, making most teachers unable to eat their fill, but also unable to starve to death, living in the same environment of firewood, rice, oil, and vegetables as civil servants, which is really not a good strategy. Teacher treatment could not support families during the price control period, and now that prices have jumped more than ten times, and teacher salaries have only increased by one and a half times, they cannot even afford to buy a stone of rice. The "strike" tide is like a flood. How can we talk about education? When the next generation sees this kind of thing, isn't it a kind of anti-education! On the 15th, the Legislative Yuan passed an increase measure, but it must be submitted to the Political Affairs Conference, the Review Conference, and then to the Legislative Yuan, for review, discussion, and then sent to the Executive Yuan. It is a long journey. By the time the measure is promulgated, won't the teachers be at the end of their rope! After such discussion, November has passed, and the Ministry of Finance is happy to add it from December onwards, adding a "skimming policy" on top of the "starvation policy." This kind of proud masterpiece has been performed many times, and we hope that we will not repeat the same mistakes. (November 25)

### Sun Ke Expresses Personal Opinions to American Reporters

[United Press, This City] Sun Ke, the newly appointed Executive Yuan President of China, met with a United Press reporter alone on the 27th and gave a speech, stating that it was his personal opinion. He hoped to form a government representing all levels of the country soon, but did not intend to invite the Communist Party to join the cabinet.

Acquiring Military Aid Policy Will Be Submitted to the Cabinet for Discussion

Sun Ke said: Given the current environment, his government will inevitably reflect American views in some respects. Sun also said: In his personal opinion, China should make reasonable concessions to obtain important American military aid as soon as possible. He plans to submit this policy to the cabinet for discussion. Dr. Sun said: China urgently needs military giants of MacArthur's caliber from the United States to come to China to serve as the supreme military advisor, guide the suppression of the communists, and China is willing to give them full authority. When asked if he agreed to reopen the Yangtze River and other inland rivers for foreign ships to transport goods in and out, Sun replied that he intended to do so. He said: In certain circumstances, US naval vessels can use China's inland rivers based on the opinions of US military advisors. If a policy can be established allowing US warships to patrol the Yangtze River, China will naturally not object. Sun once again emphasized that all his remarks were personal opinions, stating that he agreed to immediately give "new deal" preferential treatment to foreign businesses in Shanghai and other parts of China, reasonably encourage and protect the rights and interests of foreign businesses. He hopes to hold talks with American and other foreign businesses during his stay in Shanghai, and has invited the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai to provide suggestions.

If the Communist Party Occupies China, All of Asia Will Be Reddened

Dr. Sun said: He does not believe there is any possibility of negotiating peace with the Chinese Communists, and believes that the war will be fought to the end. He also said that he believes President Chiang is determined to continue fighting at all costs, and the President believes that obtaining large amounts of US aid is highly promising. Sun said that he has not thought about moving the capital to Guangzhou or elsewhere at present. Sun Ke said: There is no doubt that the Chinese Communist Party is part of the world communist movement and closely cooperates with the Soviet Union. If the Communist Party occupies China, the reddening of all of Asia is only a "matter of time", and Japan and the Philippines may also fall into communist hands in the future. Premier Sun said that the Soviet Union's current policy toward China seems to be to immediately establish a strong foothold in the Northeast and actively advance southward. The communist plan does not seem to be to create an independent "Manchukuo" state, as Japan did. On the contrary, Sun said, the Chinese Communist Party may first establish a regime under the name of "People's Democratic Republic of China" to win the favor of the people, and then, after becoming deeply rooted, establish a complete totalitarian government based on the Soviet model.

### Opinions on the Berlin Currency Issue, The Four Powers' Reply Officially Announced, Britain, the United States, and France Believe That Separate Negotiations on the Monetary System Are of No Help, Neutral Countries Will Put Forward Another New Proposal

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] The Security Council will convene on the 29th to study the Berlin issue. According to United Nations sources: The Chairman of the Security Council, Bramuglia, will again submit a new proposal drafted jointly with various neutral countries to the four powers today. This proposal is drafted based on the four powers' replies to his request for opinions on the Berlin currency issue. It is heard that Bramuglia will submit this proposal to the Security Council before he submits it to the new Chairman of the Security Council, Representative Bee, on December 1.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] According to well-informed United Nations sources: The Chairman of the Security Council, Bramuglia, will submit a new proposal on the Berlin issue to the four countries of the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France tomorrow, requesting the latter to submit a reply on Monday. The new method of resolving the Berlin issue contained in the new proposal is the result of detailed research by experts from six neutral countries in the past two days. If the four countries can submit a reply within the specified time, then Bramuglia will convene the Security Council on Monday afternoon or Tuesday to make a decision. It is reported that Bramuglia, who specializes in dealing with the Berlin issue and is acting as the Chairman of the Security Council, will end his appointment on November 30. Tonight, Bramuglia has published the Soviet Union and the opinions of Britain, the United States, and France on the Berlin currency system, as well as the memorandum of the British and French financial experts on this issue.

[United Press, Paris, 26th] The United States, Britain, and France, on the 26th, have in fact closed the door to any possible agreement on the Berlin issue until the Soviet Union is willing to restore the Berlin municipal government under the control of the four powers. The position of the Western three powers was revealed after the four powers announced their replies to the request for opinions submitted by the Chairman of the Security Council, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia. Their replies revealed that the Western powers believed that the Soviet Union had almost completely divided Berlin into two different regions. The Western reply clearly stated that the three powers believed that at a time when the Berlin administration was divided and when the Soviet Union seemed determined to further divide Berlin by any other possible means, even attempting to rebuild a unified Berlin monetary system would be useless. This means that a unified Berlin including all administrative institutions must first be restored before the monetary system can be considered. The Western reply accused the unified administration of Berlin under the control of the four powers of "rapidly disappearing." The Soviet Union's reply to Bramuglia was much simpler than the Western countries' replies. The reply reiterated the Soviet Union's request to implement the Moscow agreement in August as the basis for the four powers to control the Berlin monetary system. According to the Moscow agreement mentioned by the Soviet Union, the acceptance of the Soviet East German mark as the only monetary system in the entire city of Berlin and the Soviet Union's lifting of the blockade of Berlin will be implemented simultaneously. The agreement was issued to the four powers' military chiefs in Germany for implementation, but the Berlin conference was again in a deadlock.

[Associated Press, Paris, 27th] US Representative Sharpe told reporters today that the United States' acceptance of the idea that the Soviet mark should circulate throughout the Berlin area will never abandon the provisions of the Moscow Agreement in August this year.

### Chinese and Soviet Representatives Argue Fiercely on the Greek Issue at the UN General Assembly, Chiang Tingfu Expresses Support for the Balkan Report

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] The United Nations General Assembly continued to convene this afternoon to review the Greek issue. Representatives from China, Britain, and Greece all spoke, defending the case that the majority of countries supported extending the term of the Balkan Committee and ordering Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia to stop assisting the Greek guerrillas. British Representative McNeil said: It only takes an order from the three northern neighbors of Greece to stop all assistance to the Greek guerrillas and prevent the Greek guerrillas from attempting to establish an organization that implements a policy of terror.

Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris said: The Greek guerrillas are a threat to peace in Southeast Europe and the entire world. The British representative believes that foreign intervention is the main cause of the Greek civil war. He strongly advocated that Greece establish diplomatic relations with its northern neighbors. The Chinese representative expressed support for the majority proposal and said that Greece is a victim of foreign aggression and is enough to threaten world peace.

[Associated Press, Paris, 27th] Soviet Representative Vyshinsky spoke for one hour and forty minutes at the UN General Assembly today, attacking the report of the Balkan Investigation Team, accusing it of being a pretext for American and British imperialism to interfere in Greece. After the speech, representatives of the Slavic bloc applauded. Chinese Representative Chiang Tingfu then spoke, supporting the report of the investigation team. He briefly said, "What is imperialism? It is obvious to all. After the Second World War, the United States abandoned the Philippines, and Britain also granted independence to India, Pakistan, Burma, and Ceylon. If the world is only threatened by this kind of imperialism, then the representatives of the UN General Assembly can go home. Give their people the best Christmas gift, world peace, and world security." Chiang's speech won warm applause.

[Associated Press, Paris, 26th] Yugoslav Representative White today accused the United States of fighting against the Greek people and implementing an economic cold war in Eastern Europe. Some representatives closed their eyes and slept during his loud speech, including British Acting Foreign Minister McNeil. Poland proposed banning one country from imposing economic pressure on another to influence its domestic and foreign policies, thereby condemning the US aid to the European Recovery Program, but was rejected by the General Assembly by a vote of thirty-three to six. Only the Soviet bloc voted in favor, and India, Burma, and the Philippines abstained.

### The Next Chairman of the Security Council Will Be From Belgium

[Associated Press, Paris, 27th] The term of the rotating chairman of the United Nations Security Council, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, will expire at the end of the month. Starting on the first of next month, Belgian Representative Kuyzenhov will serve as chairman. Bramuglia said that some kind of plan will be established for the Berlin issue before the end of the month, but this does not mean that the Berlin issue can be resolved immediately.

### The South Korean Government Plans to Ask Our UN General Assembly Delegation to Appeal to the US Military to Stay in South Korea, Lee Beom-seok is Consulting with Our Consul General

[Central News Agency, Hansong, 27th] A Central News Agency reporter learned from reliable sources that the South Korean government, based on observations of various signs, knows that the US military will withdraw soon, so it plans to ask the Chinese delegation to the UN General Assembly to find a way to allow the United Nations to approve the continued stationing of the US military. South Korean Prime Minister Lee Beom-seok had a 45-minute meeting with our Consul General Xu Shaochang (who is currently acting as our ambassador to Representative Liu Yuwan) on the afternoon of the 26th. Although the content of the conversation is unknown, it is said that Lee Beom-seok has informed Consul General Xu of this plan, and the latter believes that China may take action according to South Korea's intentions. It is reported that Lee said to our Consul General Xu during the meeting that the US military is preparing to withdraw. But he also said that so far, we cannot say for sure that the country has no intention of staying in South Korea. It is said that Lee Beom-seok has also informed our government of this intention and asked Xu Shaochang and Stuart to relay this intention to our delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. When the United Nations discusses the Korean issue (or even earlier), the South Korean government may reorganize to show the United Nations that the South Korean government under the leadership of Lee Seung-man is making efforts to improve its own organization in order to adapt to the current situation. It is reported that a South Korean official who had just returned from Paris told Lee Seung-man that some representatives in the United Nations had a poor impression of the current South Korean situation, so he advised Lee to reorganize the cabinet as soon as possible. Observers say that if the cabinet is indeed reorganized, at least the three ministers who have been most criticized by all parties (including the Minister of Interior and the Minister of Commerce) will be forced to resign, and Prime Minister Lee Beom-seok may also resign.

### Italy, Norway, Ireland, and Portugal Will Receive Invitations to Join the Atlantic Alliance, British and French Opinions Differ on the European Federal Conference

[United Press, Washington, 26th] Diplomatic circles said on the 26th that Italy may be invited to join the planned North Atlantic Security Alliance. They said that the treaty with Italy did not stipulate that Italy was prohibited from participating in this treaty. This proposed anti-communist alliance will include the United States, Canada, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Some people who advocate this alliance believe that Italy's participation is very important because Italy is located on the flank of France, occupies a strategic position in the Mediterranean, is adjacent to Eastern Europe, and needs to rebuild its armed forces. According to news from Rome, Italy welcomes joining this alliance. Under the treaty, Italy can establish an army of 185,000 people, 65,000 policemen, various aviation personnel not exceeding 2,500 people, 200 heavy and light tanks, and some non-military aircraft. In addition to Italy, it is expected that other countries will also receive invitations, including Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, and Portugal. If these two countries express their willingness to join the alliance in informal negotiations, it is hoped that the invitation will be issued at the beginning of this year.

Because the opinions of Britain and France are too different, it is said that Belgium and the Netherlands are working to reconcile them.

### Registration for Public and Education Employee Dependents Closes December 5th

Employees Not Previously Listed Can Quickly Submit

The Municipal Public and Education Employee Material Supply Committee previously investigated and approved the number of dependents of employees from various units eligible to receive purchase permits. The statistics have long been completed. However, the number of people reported by each beneficiary unit does not align with the number of physical distribution permits. Upon review, more than 7,000 individuals have not been reported. The presumed reasons are: (1) a very small number of units have not yet submitted reports, and (2) single employees without dependents in Shanghai have not reported themselves. As distribution is imminent, in order to safeguard the rights of employees who have not been listed, the supplying unit may still submit a supplementary report by December 5th to avoid missing out. After the deadline, it will be considered a waiver of rights.

### Close Supervision of Rice Distribution and Permit Issuance; Inspection Teams Dispatched to Various Districts; Food Adjustment and Allocation Office Explains that Rice Distribution in November is Not a One-Time Exception

The rice ration permits for November have already been distributed to the citizens of each district by the district offices the day before yesterday. However, citizens did not fully understand the third item in the public announcement of the Food Adjustment and Allocation Office, which states that the November permit issuance is based on the September household registration. According to Han Tingzao, the section chief in charge of the Food Adjustment and Allocation Office, the issuance of rice ration permits has been based on Article 5 of the Implementing Regulations for Metered Rice Rationing in this city since March of this year, which stipulates: "The issuance of rice ration permits shall be based on citizens who have completed household registration procedures legally before the end of the month two months prior, regardless of gender, age, or occupation. Each person shall be issued one permit per month without charge." The reason for relying on household figures from the end of the month two months prior is because the city's household mobility is frequent. The district offices must complete the statistics by the end of the month, which are then forwarded to this office by the Civil Affairs Bureau in the following month. This number is required to print the rice permits for the month after next. Therefore, the November rice permits were printed according to the September household registration and it is not a temporary new measure. As for requiring the new ID card to obtain the rice permit, it is only to demonstrate that the individual is still residing in Shanghai and to prevent unauthorized collection by those who have left the city without reporting it. In order to strictly enforce permit distribution, the office has also invited the US Economic Cooperation Administration China Branch Civil Affairs Bureau and other organizations to form a "Temporary Permit Distribution Inspection Team," which departed yesterday morning to supervise permit distribution in the city's 30 districts. The supervision will continue until the 30th of this month, focusing on (1) whether the permit distribution personnel at all levels are issuing permits in accordance with the prescribed methods, (2) on-site correction and instruction of distribution errors, (3) spot checks to determine whether citizens are collecting multiple permits or fraudulently obtaining permits, (4) spot checks to ensure that the previously issued lists match, (5) attention to irregularities in permit distribution and improvement measures, and (6) whether the number of permits issued to refugees and public households is accurate.

### Labor Disputes Are Easing, the Social Affairs Bureau Is Less Crowded; Director Wu Issues a Statement Encouraging Sincere Cooperation Between Management and Capital

[Our News] After Mayor Wu and Commander Yi issued a statement prohibiting strikes and work slowdowns during the martial law period, and the municipal government passed three measures for handling labor disputes, labor disputes have begun to ease. Yesterday afternoon, the mediation section of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, which had recently been "overcrowded", was noticeably quieter.

Yesterday, Wu, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, specifically issued a statement regarding the handling of labor disputes, sincerely advising all workers: "The Social Affairs Bureau has always cared for workers. In the past, when labor disputes occurred, we have always encouraged management to accept reasonable demands from workers as much as possible, within the ability of the factory to bear and without hindering production order. This is a fact that is commonly seen by the public. However, recently, a small number of workers have been exploited, using the issue of livelihood as an excuse to make excessive demands and launch strikes and work slowdowns, hoping to obstruct production and disrupt social order. This is truly harming the community. During this period of intensified suppression of chaos and the implementation of martial law in the city, Mayor Wu and Commander Yi have announced the strict enforcement of the law. I am afraid that the majority of well-intentioned workers will be exploited and misled, resulting in violations of regulations, causing factory production to halt, leading to unemployment for the majority of good workers, and incurring legal sanctions. I sincerely hope that my fellow workers in the industry deeply understand the difficulties of the times and realize that labor and management must work together in the same boat with sincerity. If there are demands that are reasonable and through legal procedures, I will resolve them in the same spirit as before. Otherwise, violating the law during this period of martial law, even if I want to do my best, I will have no power to assist. I hope that the workers of all industries understand this intention."

### Cloth-for-Rice All Sold Out; Rice Industry Association Violates Agreement; Social Affairs Bureau to Investigate Responsibility

[Our News] During the price-restricted period, the Supervisory Office had given 20,000 bolts of cloth to rice merchants, instructing them to exchange it for rice from the production areas and bring it to Shanghai for the market.

### Wounded Officers and Soldiers from the Battle Transported to Shanghai in Batches by Special Plane; Hundreds Have Arrived; Representatives from All Sectors Welcome and Console Them

[Our News] Wounded officers and soldiers from the Battle of Xuzhou have been transported to Shanghai in batches by air in recent weeks, and more than 200 people have arrived so far. Yesterday, four special planes transported over a hundred more people to Shanghai. Representatives from all sectors of the city—Xie Renzhao, Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Department of the Kuomintang; Xie Yonghua, representative of the Women's Association; Hong Bin, representative of the business community; and Xu Mingya, representative of the Committee for Comforting Soldiers Fighting the Rebellion—went to the airport to offer their condolences. Xie Yonghua first presented flowers to the wounded soldiers, and then each person was given a can of food, two packs of cigarettes, and a letter of consolation. At the same time, the representatives wrote letters home on behalf of the wounded soldiers at their request. Although all the wounded officers and soldiers had endured long and arduous journeys, their spirits were very strong. They expressed great emotion for the concern of all sectors of the city and the warmth shown to them. According to Deng Juchen, a company commander of a certain National Army unit who was wounded, the National Army was extremely motivated in the operations around Xuzhou. Every time the bandit army encountered them, they formed an encirclement with several times their numbers. The National Army held their ground, responded calmly, and often went without sleep or food for days and nights. The difficult and arduous conditions, especially the difficulty of obtaining water, were truly heroic and tragic. In the end, they were able to defeat the many with the few. The bandit army mostly hid in various places during the day due to fear of the power of our air force, and then gathered and moved around at night. Their method of attack was to first concentrate artillery fire with flat and curved trajectories, and then launch their so-called "human wave tactics," driving soldiers to charge. According to Company Commander Deng, during the bandit's charge, our heavy and light machine guns often fired non-stop for three or four hours, which can be imagined to be extremely brutal. Each time, the bandit army's corpses piled up like mountains, and we often captured more than 500 machine guns in one battle. Because our fortifications were solid, our losses were minimal. At the same time, the general education level of the National Army was very high and their faith was firm. Even if they fell into the hands of the bandits and were forced to make a "counter-attack," they all resolutely refused, preferring to be killed. Therefore, the bandits were always deeply afraid of our army and dared not look them in the eye.

I hope you will continue your efforts. Chiang Kai-shek, Secret Office of the President, sealed."

### Calm and Composed, Without Any Sign of Grief

The three defendants Chen Yuansheng, Wang Hailiang, and Jiang Jixiang were all wearing black cotton winter casual clothes, with thick eyebrows and large eyes. They were calm and composed in court, without any sign of grief, and whispered to each other, occasionally showing smiles. Their testimonies were similar. They all stated that life in prison was very difficult. Liu Ali, who was in the same cell, proposed a way to escape. Wang Hailiang obtained a hacksaw from foreign prisoners outside the prison and obtained a large number of gauze bandages from the prison infirmary, which were made into ropes. At around 2:00 AM on August 23rd, during a heavy rain, they sawed through the iron bars of the wall window and then climbed down the ropes. They then took advantage of the opportunity to escape. They then took a car from the Huade Automobile Company across from the Shanghai Prison to Shiliupu, where they bought a boat to cross the river to Jiang Jixiang's home in Pudong. Jiang's wife, Zhao Ruizhen, gave them 10 million legal tender and a gold ring. After mortgaging the gold ring for 20 gold yuan at the home of Jiang's cousin Jiang Shengfa, the three then separated. Liu Ali strongly denied that he initiated the escape, as Chen and others stated, claiming that he had heard that an amnesty was imminent and that his sentence was about to expire, so he did not want to escape. After each of the other defendants was questioned one by one, the court immediately announced the sentence as above. When the defendants Chen Yuansheng and others were returned to prison, they were all shackled, with many bailiffs temporarily taking care of them in court.

### Wang Changkang, One of the Guarantors in the Lin Wang Company Case, Indicted by the District Prosecutor's Office

Wang Chunzhe, the general manager of Lin Wang Company, who had been sentenced to death by the Special Criminal Court and executed by firing squad, and his cousin Zheng Jiayu, the deputy manager of the company, had already been arrested by the police.

After Wang Chunzhe was executed, his will stated that Zheng was actually the main culprit in the case. At this time, Zheng had already fled to Hong Kong.

### Restrictions on Remittances Between Shanghai and Guangzhou Reinstated; High-Interest Deposits in Banks and Firms to Be Inspected

It has been learned from financial authorities that the authorities have decided to re-enforce restrictions on remittances and cash transfers between Shanghai and Guangzhou. The maximum amount that each traveler or remitter can send from Shanghai is RMB 1,000 per day. The maximum amount that each bank or firm can remit to Guangzhou is RMB 100,000 per day. Each bank and firm must submit a report on their remittances to Guangzhou to the financial authorities every day after business hours in the afternoon. It is reported that this measure will also be implemented in Hankou at the same time, with a limit of half that of Shanghai.

Also, the financial management authorities have been paying close attention to the recent practice of commercial banks competing to attract deposits with high interest rates. According to a person in charge of the bureau, the bureau will send personnel to various banks and firms at any time it deems necessary to inspect their deposit ledgers.

### Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates in High Demand

Yesterday, the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates remained very firm due to the influence of the previous day's strength. Export transfer certificates were priced at $29 and overseas remittance transfer certificates at $52, but trading volume was low.

Exporters believe that this situation is due to (1) the issuance of import permits by the Import-Export Control Commission some days ago, and (2) the rise in the black market price of US dollars in recent days. However, they pointed out that this price is still far from the actual market price, so they hope that the import and export linkage measures under consideration can be finalized and announced as soon as possible so that the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates can return to normal.

### Rumor of Gold Price Adjustment Denied by National Bank

Yesterday morning, rumors spread that the government would adjust the deposit exchange rate starting next week, so the number of people lining up to withdraw money at the four designated banks increased even more. A reporter from the United Credit Investigation Office specifically visited a person in charge of the business bureau of the Central Bank for this matter. According to them, although the matter was ordered by the government, in view of the current situation, the adjustment rumor is believed to be completely unfounded. They also believed that this rumor may have been deliberately released by gold and currency black marketeers or speculators to achieve their goal of obtaining windfall profits.

### Technical Meeting on the Linkage System

Focus on Foreign Exchange Control Issues

According to news from the Import-Export Control Commission, although the Ministry of Finance appointed Wu Xingzhou, Director of the Monetary Affairs Department, and Cheng Dacheng, Counselor, to come to Shanghai to discuss the detailed implementation measures of the import and export linkage system, Wu was unable to leave Beijing due to unforeseen circumstances. Therefore, only Cheng came to Shanghai the other day. After contacting the relevant parties such as the Import-Export Control Commission and the Central Bank, it was decided to move the meeting to Beijing because several important issues required further instructions from the central government. The Import-Export Control Commission has also appointed Chen Junren, Director of the Export Promotion Department, to attend as a representative, and Chen left Shanghai for Beijing yesterday morning.

According to the spokesperson of the Commission, the reason why the implementation measures cannot be decided at present is mostly due to the issue of foreign exchange control, rather than the technical issue of import and export control. However, they believed that a decision might be reached at the Nanjing meeting this time.

### Rice Prices Decline Again; Flour, Grain, Oil Cakes Rise Slightly

The rice market still showed no signs of improvement, and prices fell again yesterday. Although arrivals have decreased slightly, the outflow is still sluggish, and sales are still sluggish.

### Cotton Yarn Market Weak and Declining

### Fabrics Mediocre

The fabric market was sluggish because actual sales were still sluggish. Customers' willingness to purchase was weak due to high prices. Twelve-yard Longtou fine cloth initially called for a firm price of $15, but at noon it fell back to $405 at the close, a rise of $10 from the previous day, but it was heard after the close that there were sellers at $395, and finally a transaction was made at $410. The price of Sijunzi Yuan Biji only rose by $25 to $395. The rest of the fabric market was not smooth, and price fluctuations were also small.

### Silk Reverts

Yesterday, rayon stopped rising and turned to falling. The money supply in the market tightened, dark interest rates rose, and retail investors outside the industry kept selling. Sentiment was weak, and prices fell steadily. The initial price of 120-count Tianqiao was $12,500. Many people rushed to sell. Customers' willingness to purchase was weak, and the market collapsed. Prices fell in a straight line to $11,800. The silk weaving industry on this street made sporadic purchases, but those who needed it had already gathered enough money. The willingness to sell was slightly relaxed, and the market improved slightly after being soft, closing at $11,900. The price of Dongyang closed at $12,500, a drop of $500 from the previous day's noon closing price. Yesterday, the silk market was also weak and could not rise. Industry demand was very low, and everyone wanted to sell goods for cash. The market was defeated and prices also fell back. The morning opening price of D-grade 7878 evenness was $14,000, but no one asked about it after the call. The spot price of superior grade retail was called $13,300. The market's buying interest was not strong, and it fell back by $300 to $500 in an instant, hovering around $14,000 to $13,000. Transactions were extremely cold.

Xinghua White, Xinghua Red, and local sugars, Zhang Diaoqing, etc., all rose by $20 to $30.

### Foreign Tea Market Quiet

The foreign tea market, which has been quiet for a long time, did not break through yesterday. The holders of various export box teas such as Tunluo were still stubborn and unwilling to sell easily, while exporters continued to hold back. Transactions stagnated again, and the process was extremely lonely. According to this situation, it is quite difficult to become optimistic for a while. As for domestic tea, there were both inflows and outflows, and the trend was still active. The opening price was also firm because there were many people selling.

### Timber Weak

The timber market has been weak for the past half month. Since the implementation of price controls on timber, all parties have come to rush to buy it, resulting in wholesale shops losing almost half of their inventory. When the price controls were lifted, construction business plummeted due to the tense situation. A large amount of timber was sold from the hands of the construction industry, resulting in market prices falling below the cost line. Currently, white pine is around $4 and fir is around $1.3.

### Five-Cent Silver Subsidiary Coins Decided Not to Be Issued

### Taiwan Alkali Plans to Increase Production

Increase to 3,600 Tons Per Quarter

Taiwan Alkali Corporation has formulated a production increase plan. By the end of this year, the quarterly production will be 3,600 tons of alkali (currently 1,500 tons per quarter). According to industry insiders, the total amount required by various industries is more than 7,800 tons per quarter. The current quarterly output of each domestic producer using the electrolysis method is more than 3,300 tons. In addition, there is about 1,700 tons of caustic soda made from pure alkali and lime per quarter. The shortfall is about 2,800 tons. If each electrochemical plant can further increase its power and implement a production increase plan, and supplement it with caustic soda made from pure alkali and lime, the caustic soda problem in the chemical industry can be self-sufficient at a minimum and has a bright future.

### Villagers Attack in Chenjiaqiao, Wuxi; Henan Joint High School Destroyed; Dozens of Students Killed and Injured

— This Newspaper Special Correspondent Wang Shoumei

[This newspaper Wuxi 25th fast news] An organized vicious case occurred in Chenjiaqiao, about twelve miles north of Wuxi, at eight o'clock this morning. Six to seven hundred villagers participated in the case, and the newly established Henan Joint High School in the village was destroyed. Thirty-eight students of the school were injured, and twenty-seven students were beaten by villagers holding guns and sticks, then tied up and thrown into the river. Their survival is unknown. When the atrocities were carried out, the students were chased by the villagers, like lambs encountering wolves. The cries for help could be heard for several miles. The school has a total of 1,192 students, all junior high school students who fled south from Henan. Their ages are all around sixteen or seventeen. Each person is issued 20 taels of rice and 3.5 cents for non-staple food by the school every day. Since the lifting of price controls at the beginning of this month, the students' non-staple food expenses are not enough for oil and salt alone. Due to the extreme shortage of firewood in the area, the students' non-staple food expenses for the whole month are not enough to buy half a burden of rice straw. The students have no choice but to pick up firewood themselves. There have been occasional verbal disputes with the villagers due to the students breaking off dry branches of mulberry and willow trees, but because the school authorities are strict, no unfortunate incidents have occurred so far. Unexpectedly, at around eight o'clock this morning, a student had a dispute with the owner of a pancake shop in Chenjiaqiao when buying pancakes. Teachers and staff in the school immediately rushed to dissuade them after hearing the news. The villagers who were watching actually pulled out

Gun Threat

At the same time, they also rang gongs and shouted, gathering people to beat them. At one time, hundreds of villagers, led and incited by a few people, swarmed to the school office and started fighting, destroying all doors, windows, tables, chairs, documents and office supplies. The director of the school, Wang Junjie, and teachers came forward to comfort them, but were also beaten. Hu Qian, the district chief of Zhang Village, which is next to the school, was also present, but did not take appropriate measures to stop the riots. In addition, students living in Youjia Ancestral Hall, Wujia Ancestral Hall, and Wangjiadang, four or five miles away from the village, were also systematically beaten by the villagers at the same time. The scale was large and the situation was more tragic than Chenjiaqiao. The students in each place were caught off guard and had no defense, so they were all beaten. The villagers in Wujia Ancestral Hall surrounded the student dormitories, and also went up to the roof to tear down the houses, throwing bricks and stones at the students, and planned to set fire to the dormitories, but they were spared because the nearby women begged for mercy. Occasionally, a few students fled into the wilderness, but they were chased and beaten by groups of villagers. Hundreds of villagers in Wangjiadang, after beating the students severely, tied up 27 students including Fu Helili with ropes and threw them into the river. Because the river was too deep, except for Fu Helili, who swam out because he was familiar with the water, the other 26 people have not been rescued by the evening. It is also heard that some students in Youjia Ancestral Hall and scattered students were also thrown into the river and buried alive. Because the order has not yet been restored, it is still impossible to investigate how many students died. Thirty-eight injured students have now been identified, and no villagers have been injured or killed. Because the students are under the strict control of the school, they have not resisted so far, so a more unfortunate fight has not occurred. After the incident, Ye Zhaoxing, Director of the Political Work Department of the Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, Section Chief Mu Yue, Liu Younong, Supervisor of the Wuxi City Defense Headquarters, Zhu Yabo, Captain of the Second Brigade of the Wuxi County Government Security Police, etc., were ordered to lead troops, police and medical personnel to the scene at 12:00 noon to suppress the investigation. Ye and others were extremely heartbroken to see the destruction of the school and the young refugee students with broken heads, bleeding, broken arms and legs. In addition to ordering 23 seriously injured students to be sent to the city for hospitalization, they immediately reprimanded Chief Hu, who was negligent in prevention in advance and failed to stop the riots in time, and limited him to immediately capture the ringleaders. Chief Hu was afraid of the difficulty and shirked his responsibility. It was not until dusk that he handed over two people to the city for interrogation. In order to prevent similar incidents from happening again that night, Chief Hu also made a guarantee to the responsible authorities to ensure the safety of the school staff and students. A storm finally subsided temporarily. According to a post-event investigation, this atrocity has a political background. Gao, a gentry in the village, was forced by the crowd during the assault and refused to comply, which resulted in his home also being destroyed. This matter is still developing, and it is hoped that the relevant authorities will quickly seek a reasonable and legal solution to maintain the security of the rear.

### Refugee Diversion Stations Set Up in Bengbu County and Other Places

### Public Sentiment

— Jing Wen

In the recent U.S. election, President Truman's re-election was an unexpected outcome. Not only did those like Dewey, who were confident of victory beforehand, feel surprised, but even several so-called public opinion organizations known for conducting "public opinion polls" were left speechless. The only explanation heard today is that a shift in American public sentiment led to Truman's victory.

Who becomes the American president is an American affair. However, given the disadvantageous position Mr. Truman was in at the time, his ability to achieve such an overwhelming victory undeniably includes the factor of public sentiment. Although America has the stronghold of Wall Street, it is, after all, the most democratic country in the modern world, and the power of public sentiment can play a decisive role in politics.

But what exactly is public sentiment or the human heart? There's a saying in our common parlance, "Every heart is different, just like every face," indicating that the human heart is the most elusive thing. The branch of psychology dealing with crowd psychology is likely studying this public sentiment or human heart. However, I personally believe that someone deeply versed in crowd psychology isn't necessarily someone who can deeply win the hearts of the people. A politician skilled in political maneuvering naturally understands how to grasp crowd psychology, but they may not necessarily be able to grasp genuine public sentiment. This is because crowd psychology belongs to technique, while public sentiment belongs to morality.

Someone who can win the hearts of the people and also grasp crowd psychology will naturally be sure to win. However, relying solely on the use of crowd psychology may sometimes achieve success, but the lifespan of such success will not be long. Most of the treacherous officials throughout history were able to use crowd psychology, but they were ultimately just treacherous officials. Hitler and Mussolini are typical examples of this.

Then what exactly is public sentiment? How can public opinion be grasped? Although I am not a psychologist, I dare to compare public sentiment to flowing water. It can flow with the current, it can flow against the current, and sometimes it even breaks through. It can lift a person to the highest heavens, and it can also send the same person to the deepest hell. During the French Revolution of the 18th century, several figures who were considered heroes of their time by the people were sent to the guillotine by the same "public sentiment." The elusiveness of public sentiment is truly awe-inspiring. In Ibsen's play "An Enemy of the People," the blind side of public sentiment was satirically depicted.

Originally, although public sentiment is an irresistible force, it is not the most reliable, because it is a mixed product of reason and emotion. Sometimes it may become a final judgment of a trend, but sometimes it is just a blind force that can lead astray. The unreliability of public opinion polls is due to this reason.

However, public sentiment or the human heart does exist, and it does have a decisive force. It truly possesses the power of "those who obey me prosper, those who oppose me perish." Although it is an abstract existence, it can change trends on a small scale and create history on a large scale. It can create and it can destroy. The question is how to grasp public sentiment and how to use the human heart. The ancient saying "those who follow Heaven prosper" is, in fact, simply teaching people how to grasp public sentiment.

Because public sentiment is not entirely reliable, grasping it requires great wisdom and insight. In other words, grasping public sentiment is not about simply conforming to it, but rather about focusing on appropriate guidance. I once said that public sentiment is like flowing water. Going with the flow is sometimes a good way to conform to public opinion, but the most important thing is to be able to see the source of the water clearly and guide it. If you ask where the source of public sentiment lies, I would answer, "fairness."

"Fairness resides in the hearts of the people" is a very common saying, but precisely because it is so common, it represents a truth. Are our social facilities in accordance with fairness? Are our political systems in accordance with fairness? Are our economic policies in accordance with fairness? The question of where the human heart is heading depends on this answer of fairness.

Now, people are often heard calling for winning back public sentiment, but in my opinion, lost public sentiment is like spilled water that is difficult to recover. It would be better to rebuild fairness to revitalize public sentiment, which is the fundamental solution.

### Records of Returning East

— Shi Shufan

Heavy words of farewell, the lamp dim, how can the wild pass tolerate weary birds flying? Borrowing chopsticks to first plan the fundamental strategy, getting out of the carriage to see the city gate isn't what it was; A clean cup breaks the vow as the sky first cools, in my prime, following the green temple is something to rely on (residing at the Wisdom Sun Nunnery), do not say that the kasaya is tightly tied with sorrow, opening the chest there's still old cotton clothing.

A hungry ox overturns the carriage, and wild geese cry in the marsh, who is making injustice in this world! There should be no dream of firewood and gall to change the world, there are many children and soldiers in famous mountains; Feeding chestnuts in front of the chest, the monkey is hard to trust, after illness, returning home at night is easy to be startled, getting up to listen to the branches of the trees, the wind hasn't stopped, the leaves flutter, making sounds of resentment and parting.

The Yellow Bamboo Shore is deep, swallowing the evening tide, the abandoned Martyr Altar (on the peak of Dragon Spring Mountain) is covered in tall artemisia, instead I lead my wife and children to live in confusion, how dare I say that talent is gradually declining? With what heart do I endure this age of calamity, the southeast at this time enters despair, fat frost makes a ball like the autumn moon, there's still clear light wanting to soak my waist.

Cooking smoke from the roof gives birth to warmth, now I know that in this floating world, being full is supreme, resigned to wasting my mind and strength for rice and salt, I can't bear to see Xu and Si connected by the marks of war! My life is nothing more than the suffering of sleeplessness, sacred places have each survived hundreds of battles, could there be immortal monkeys in the green bamboo, would buddhas come to discuss with the pedantic scholar?

### Jottings Under the Fence

— He Ku

Recently, when reading the newspaper, apart from advertisements and supplements, most of the domestic and foreign dispatches and local news are things that make one frown. However, among the news that makes one frown, from a writer's point of view, I have read several good articles.

For example, one good article is MacArthur's ruling on the Tokyo criminals. There must be a skilled writer in MacArthur's administration. This skilled writer is able to avoid official jargon in solemn documents and apply the colors of emotion everywhere, which is a strength uniquely lacking among the secretaries in our government administrations. I still remember MacArthur's speech when he first arrived in Tokyo and accepted the surrender, beginning with, "From Pearl Harbor to Tokyo, a long journey, we have finally arrived." A feeling of reflecting on the past and looking at the present leaps off the page.

The ruling issued by MacArthur this time is also like this. The beginning of the ruling is like this: "In my floating career, I have encountered many unsatisfactory things, but what my heart least desires but must do is first and foremost reviewing the sentences of the Japanese war criminals convicted by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East." His humble and unwilling feelings almost make us disbelieve that it comes from the pen of a commander who once dominated the world! Today, most people in the world believe that MacArthur's control over Japan is too lenient. This argument relates to the global situation and is not something this small article dares to discuss. However, his ability to set aside arrogance and not take revenge as the victor, his broad-mindedness, is worthy of the world's contemplation. And look at MacArthur's attitude toward the verdict: "What is decided by humans can never be without error. However, I know that I am sincerely unable to find a better method than this trial to clarify justice and fairness… However, the evolution of modern society is not yet complete, and there is no other institution more qualified and confident to issue this solemn verdict." His starting point for agreeing with the International Military Tribunal's verdict is based on the above reasons.

Regarding the purpose of executing the grand trial and sentencing, MacArthur's intention is to "show all good people in the world that war is useless and is only the greatest sin of mankind and the most despicable disaster, and to enlighten all countries in the world to collectively abandon war." This is the only official cliché that MacArthur's ruling reveals. Because "all good people in the world" already know the uselessness of war, but they still cannot escape this "despicable disaster." This "greatest sin" is still being constantly created or carried out. Is it really because, as MacArthur said, "the evolution of modern society is not yet complete"?

Finally, what should be mentioned is that this United Press dispatch translation is indeed elegant and accurate, able to convey the spirit of the original dispatch in another language in a roundabout way. As soon as we compare it to the original, we can know the difficulty of translating this dispatch, and this Chinese dispatch published in major newspapers is, of course, the most satisfying one.

While I'm at it, I'd like to point out one thing. The Chinese opening of the dispatch is "In my floating career," and the original text is In long public service. MacArthur is an active-duty soldier, which doesn't seem to match the Chinese "floating career," and the words "floating" are merely an idiom, with no original text to refer back to. In my opinion, it should be changed to "I have been in the military for a long time," but this is close to nitpicking, because in the rush to translate many dispatches, you can't chew on words like this.

### Eisenhower's Words

— Kuan Nai

In World War II, General Eisenhower led the Allied forces, attacking North Africa, attacking Sicily, landing in Italy, landing in France, liberating all of Europe, and defeating countless famous German generals. It can truly be said that his achievements are unparalleled and his name will be remembered forever. No wonder many people wanted to invite him to run for president before the recent U.S. election. Here are two small examples that can show us his insight.

During the landing battle in Italy, the American army received information that German generals were intensifying propaganda, exaggerating the results of the battle, in order to encourage morale.

General Eisenhower, however, said: "They are exaggerating their victory, but we must never exaggerate. We must never allow our country to have a wrong feeling that our victory is an easy matter. The only thing created by this illusion is excessive optimism, and excessive optimism often turns into excessive pessimism when encountering setbacks. Excessive optimism is useless, and excessive pessimism is very harmful."

Therefore, even though Eisenhower knew that he had achieved initial success when the Allied forces successfully landed in France, he repeatedly emphasized to reporters that the future of the war would inevitably be difficult and that the military and civilians of the whole country must intensify their efforts - without a single word of complacency!

Another time, it was when the Allied forces were approaching Berlin, but then turned to advance southeast. His decision not to occupy Berlin was strongly criticized by American newspapers, which believed that a great opportunity had been lost. But Eisenhower said that the purpose of the battle was to defeat the enemy's military strength and end the war as soon as possible. At that time, the German army claimed to have a strong army in the southeast, called the "national fortress," and the Allied forces certainly could not clear this obstacle before first clearing this resistance for the sake of a city. As for Berlin, although gaining it would make big headlines in the newspapers, he said, "We are not fighting for big headlines."

Eisenhower's success was not accidental!
