[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou by This Newspaper, 16th] The Eastern Advancing National Army, Qiu Qingquan's Corps, has joined forces with Huang Baitao's Corps, which has been firmly defending Nianzhuang, at Bayi Village.

[Urgent Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th Morning, 11:00 AM] Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters announces: The bandit troops on the east and west flanks of Xuzhou are now in full retreat, fleeing in disarray. The bandit troops on the southern line are also in complete disarray. Our various armies are now pursuing and attacking with overwhelming force, aiming to annihilate them all.

[Urgent Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th Noon, 12:00 PM] Military News: The bandits surrounding Xuzhou have suffered heavy casualties in recent days due to our army and air force's fierce attacks. Since the evening of the 15th, the bandits on the eastern line have begun to collapse and retreat. By 9:00 AM on the 16th, they had completely dispersed and retreated in the directions of Taierzhuang, Yixian, Pixian, Tancheng, and Guanhu Town. Our powerful Huang, Qiu, and Li Corps are in hot pursuit. There have been many bandit casualties and surrenders at Artillery Depot, Xin'anzhen, Gangfangji, Lanshishan, and Huanglongshan. In the vicinity of Nianzhuang alone, over 8,000 bandits have surrendered and laid down their arms to our Huang Corps. Other weapons and materials are piled up like mountains and are currently being inventoried. Since the fierce fighting began on the 8th, the bandits facing the Huang Corps alone have suffered over 93,000 casualties. Currently, large formations of our air force are universally bombing and destroying the bandits' important crossings along the Grand Canal and blockading the bandits' retreat west of the Grand Canal. The bandit vehicles retreating along the railway and highway are also completely destroyed by our bombing. Liu Bocheng's general headquarters of the bandits at Sanbao Station on the Jinpu Line has been completely destroyed by us. Liu himself barely escaped with his life and fled west in disarray. We have captured many important documents, including the bandits' command system chart. It is reported that Liu was ordered by the head bandit Zhu De to command the operations on the east and west lines. With his command post destroyed, the two bandit chiefs, Chen Yi and Chen Geng, lost their command and fled with the defeated troops in panic. Our ground forces are continuing their resolute pursuit. Our air force is distributing leaflets and preferential treatment certificates to persuade the bandit troops to surrender. It is expected that the fleeing bandits will soon be completely disintegrated.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th] After 2:00 AM this morning, dense artillery fire was heard northeast and northwest of Xuzhou, ceasing only at 6:00 AM. It is now known that the bandits' Liangguang Column, in order to cover the retreat of the bandits on the east and west flanks, launched a harassing attack on various villages northwest of Jiuli Mountain. After the local troops of Su and Lu, led by Geng Jixun, Zhang Kaiyue, and Hu Li, coordinated with the National Army to launch a fierce attack, and the Xuzhou artillery group brought its power to bear in support, the bandits were defeated and retreated westward at dawn. As for the artillery fire in the northeast, it was the Xuzhou artillery group carrying out a destructive bombardment of the bandits fleeing north of the Bulao River.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th] The National Army advancing south from Xuzhou engaged the 28th Regiment of the 9th Division of Liu's Third Column, which was collapsing, in the Yang Shantou, Wu Jia Du, and Nvwa Mountain area, more than 30 li south of Xuzhou, this morning. The bandits left behind over 800 corpses. Taking advantage of the victory, the National Army advanced towards the over 3,000 bandits in Wu Lou and Xinzhuang, south of Sanbao. The National Army advancing north from Jinpu captured Renqiao, south of Su County, today. The Anhui Northern Corps has also approached the outskirts of Su County and made contact with the garrison there. The various armies from the north and south are now coordinating to launch a fierce attack on the bandits near Su County with the National Army who are holding onto Su County. [Another dispatch] Starting at 9:00 PM tonight, artillery fire was again heard south of Xuzhou. According to military sources, Chen Yi's Eighth Column, in order to cover the retreat of the bandit army, launched an attack on Weijia Lake on the outskirts of Xuzhou. Our cavalry units, seeing through their plot, pretended to retreat in order to lure the enemy in deep. After the bandits occupied Weijia Lake, they ventured further north. We waited until they advanced to Jiayuan and then launched a strong counterattack. Friendly forces on both sides also coordinated to launch a pincer attack, annihilating two regiments of bandits. The remaining bandits fled in panic.

### Deng Wenyi Talks About His Return from Observing the Battle; Rare Battlefield Scene; Dust and Smoke Obscure the Sky Within More Than a Hundred Li

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 16th] Director Deng Wenyi told reporters in Xuzhou today, "In my twenty years in the military, I have never seen such a great and magnificent battlefield scene as the eastern flank of Xuzhou today." Director Deng flew over the eastern flank of Xuzhou this morning with Commander-in-Chief Liu to observe the battle. He said, "I witnessed this time, from Sanbao in Xuzhou in the south to Nianzhuang in the east, all the way south of the Longhai Railway for more than a hundred li, all of which was a battlefield. Flames of war were everywhere, and dust and smoke obscured the sky, almost the last stand before Chen Yi's collapse this morning. The special plane I was in flew relatively high. Looking down at the fighter planes coordinating with the army in combat, their heroic posture of being able to fly up and down freely, and the state of the transport planes airdropping supplies and parachutes being released in unison, were all clearly visible. Only after returning to Xuzhou and getting off the plane did he learn that the bandits in the eastern wing had already collapsed completely, and the bandits seemed to be fleeing in three routes towards the northeast, southwest, and due south." Deng also said: He had visited Guzhen from Bengbu with Commander Liu Ruming yesterday, and he had personally seen the large army advancing north from Jinpu enter Guzhen. He also heard that the Anhui Northern Corps had already entered Mengcheng. Today, he saw the large army advancing south from Xuzhou had already entered Sanbao. Estimating the time and distance, the National Army between Xuzhou and Su County might be able to encircle and annihilate one of the Chen bandit troops that was retreating southwest from the eastern flank.

### Legislative Yuan Passes Temporary Motion to Declare the Suppression of Bandits as a War Against Aggression to China and Foreign Countries to Clarify Right and Wrong and Boost Morale

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The Legislative Yuan passed the temporary emergency motion proposed by Committee Member Xu Yuanquan and others on the 16th, requesting the government to determine the nature of the war to suppress the bandits as a war against aggression, and to inform China and foreign countries to clarify right and wrong and boost morale. The text of the motion is as follows: The war to suppress the bandits can be traced back 20 years, and the recent calculation since the victory and recovery and the failure of the Political Consultative Conference has also been two years. In terms of the military strength, public support, and material resources of our government, the suppression of the rebellion should have ended long ago. The reason why it has been protracted and the bandits have grown in strength is due to the government's cherishing of people's lives and many considerations. The Communist bandits do not choose means, and their brutality and terror make it easy to achieve their destructive goals. However, the main reason is that the Communist bandits have always been a part of the international aggressive group and have direct and indirect international support. The weapons of the Japanese army in the Northeast were transferred to the hands of the Communist bandits through aggressive countries, and our country's reception of Lushun and Dalian has been repeatedly rejected, which can be taken as clear evidence. It is not only our country's strength that is facing the world's aggression, but also domestic and foreign people who are blinded by the Communist bandits' skillful propaganda and regard the war to suppress the bandits as a struggle for power. It even reverses right and wrong, regarding the Communist bandits' totalitarian terror as democracy. Not only do countries around the world that love justice and hate aggression stand by and watch, but also the people of the whole country have the idea of surviving and are less united. The key to the success or failure of the war to suppress the bandits should be to unify the views and determine the concepts. In order to make people who love peace, justice, democracy, and freedom in the whole country and the whole world understand that our country's war to suppress the bandits is a war between countries that oppose aggression and aggressive countries, that is, a war between freedom and slavery, a war between peace and terror, and a war between democracy and totalitarianism, and that it is an extension of our war of resistance to win national independence, national survival, and world peace ten years ago, not a struggle for power. It should be requested that the Yuan resolve to ask the government to determine the nature of the war to suppress the bandits as a war against aggression and inform China and foreign countries to boost morale and unify the people's hearts, so that the international community can get more help, accelerate the completion of the suppression of the rebellion, and lay the foundation for world peace. Is it appropriate? Please vote.

Editorial

### The Great Victory on the Xuzhou Front

Triumphant news arrives frequently from the Xuzhou front. Our Qiu Qingquan Corps won a victory in the Battle of Huangkou, and our Huang Botao Corps also won a victory in Nianzhuang Bayi Village. These two great victories not only shattered the communist bandits' attempt to invade Xuzhou but also laid a solid foundation for our army's position in Xuzhou. In recent days, our army has continued to expand the fruits of victory. By midnight on the 15th, the communist bandits east of Xuzhou finally collapsed and retreated northeastward in three routes. According to a report from our Air Force Headquarters, the bandit army was making a general retreat towards Xinan Town and Tai'erzhuang. Our reconnaissance aircraft saw hundreds of bandit army trucks retreating north in a disarray, continuously along the way. When this triumphant news reached the capital, all major newspapers published extra editions, and the citizens were preparing to launch a celebration rally. In today's atmosphere of low morale and public distress, we received the triumphant news from Xuzhou. The great achievements of our Qiu and Huang corps on the Xuzhou front are naturally particularly meaningful. This great victory not only stabilized the battle situation on the Xuzhou front but also stabilized the morale of the people in the Jianghuai River basin.

This time, the communist bandits' attack on Xubeng was a joint effort by the communist Chen Yi, Chen Geng, and Liu Bocheng. The forces they gathered exceeded the National Army by more than double. The communist bandits' strategy was still to "use the large to eat the small." The communist bandits east of Xuzhou attempted to encircle our Huang Botao Corps, but after the bloody struggle of the officers and soldiers of our Huang Corps and the rapid reinforcement of the Qiu Corps, the communist bandits' attempt was finally shattered, forcing the communist bandits to flee northeast, forming this unprecedented great victory. From this great victory, we can gain many valuable lessons.

First, since Jinan, Changchun, and Shenyang were abandoned one after another, a small number of defeatists almost lost confidence in the current military situation and mistakenly believed that the overall situation could not be salvaged. In fact, victory and defeat are common in war, and the gains and losses of a city or a place are not of great importance. As long as we can accept the lessons of failure and thoroughly change our strategy, it is not difficult to reverse the situation. Moreover, the victory or defeat of war is a matter of the last moment, and the key lies in morale. As long as the officers and soldiers are not afraid of death, establish strongholds, and fight to the death, they will surely win. The frequent triumphant news from Xuzhou is enough to prove that our military authorities are brave enough to admit mistakes. In the future, the planning of operations should no longer be constrained by politics, and purely focus on military matters. Solving the military difficulties is absolutely not a problem. The great victory in Xuzhou is a strong guarantee.

Second, when we study the reasons for the great victory in Xuzhou, in addition to attributing it to the brave efforts of the generals and soldiers of the Qiu and Huang corps, we must recognize that the participation of our loyal and brave air force was a major factor in this victory. The participation of our air force can not only cooperate with the land forces to inflict heavy damage on the communist bandits, but also use this advantage to "defeat the many with the few." Therefore, in future suppression military operations, we should especially strengthen this advantage. We hope that the United States can focus on this aspect in military aid to China, and the future of the suppression military operations can be greatly optimistic.

Third, there are many reasons for the communist bandits' defeat this time, but the most important one is due to their "underestimation of the enemy." The so-called "arrogant will be defeated" is an inevitable principle in military affairs. The communist bandits, relying on their large forces, were confident that they could capture Xuzhou at will. However, they did not expect that our army would fight one against ten, turning the area east of Xuzhou into the communist bandits' graveyard. This great victory should be able to wake the communist bandits from their dreams! Those who blindly believe in force to create chaos and disregard the life and death of the people will eventually fail. In our country's history, there are countless historical facts that can be used as a warning.

Fourth, the generals and soldiers on the front line calmly fight hard battles and have confidence in the military, which is gratifying. However, the people in the rear are panicking and credulously believing the rumors broadcast by the enemy. But now that they have heard the triumphant news of this great victory, how can they be worthy of the loyal and brave soldiers on the front line! This suppression is the key to the life and death of the nation, and loyalty and treachery cannot coexist. All our patriotic people should stand up and be the backing of the soldiers on the front line, contributing money and effort, comforting the soldiers, inspiring them with greater courage, and striving for the final victory of the Three Principles of the People.

### Republican Leaders Predict the United States Will Strengthen Aid to China, Wheeler Proposes Joint Meeting of Both Houses

[United Press, Washington, 16th] Republican leaders predicted today that President Truman will lead the way in taking any effective action to step up aid to China. Republican Senator Wheeler has proposed a joint meeting of the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees to consider the China issue. This proposal is more popular than the previous proposal by Republican Senator Bridges to convene a special congressional meeting to discuss the China issue. However, according to a Republican senator, any steps to expand aid to China must be initiated by President Truman. This includes ordering a consistent China policy. Congress is currently unaware of the extent of the government's policy. Aid to China has recently been stepped up, but Truman does not publicly state whether the crisis has escalated to the point where further action is needed. However, the President stated in his campaign speech that the Democratic Party would never allow the Communists to prevent the United States from aiding China and Europe while in power, which shows that the President is confident.

### Beijing Arrests Communist Suspects, Eighty-Two Captured Yesterday Morning, Being Interrogated Separately in Accordance with Martial Law

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The spokesman of the Capital Garrison Headquarters recently issued the following statement on the arrest of communist suspects in Beijing: Since the communists' full-scale attack on Xuzhou failed repeatedly, the communist plotters lurking in Beijing implemented the communist bandits' usual tactics of opening up a second battlefield in the city to echo their military offensive on the front line in an attempt to reverse the decline. Therefore, they spread news of our military defeats and news unfavorable to our side, creating a climate of terror and endangering public security. The rice-snatching frenzy that occurred a few days ago involved arson and looting of other properties at the same time. It was reported that it was indeed communist spies taking the opportunity to incite an all-out riot. After days of investigation and clues provided by those who surrendered, the lurking locations have been identified. This morning, eighty-two communist suspects were arrested and taken into custody.

### Xu Kan and Relevant Parties Discuss Import and Export Exchange Control Measures, Philippine Overseas Chinese Representatives Arrive in Beijing to Discuss Improving Remittance Issues

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Finance Minister Xu Kan is actively discussing with relevant parties the revision of import and export and foreign exchange management measures in accordance with the import and export chain system. Central Bank Vice President Liu Gongyun came to Beijing on the 15th to discuss foreign exchange management measures with Xu Kan. According to qualified sources, the import and export chain system will adopt indirect chain measures, and measures similar to foreign exchange settlement certificates may still be adopted.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Lin Wei Bai and Wang Qinghui, representatives of the Overseas Chinese from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Manila, Philippines, who were specially dispatched for the remittance issue, arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 16th. In the afternoon of the same day, accompanied by Legislator Lian Mou, they visited Finance Minister Xu Kan and Currency Department Director Wang Fuzhou to discuss improving the overseas Chinese remittance issue. According to Lin et al., in a press conference in the evening, overseas Chinese remittances from Manila alone amount to approximately US$3.5 million to US$4 million per month. After the "August 19" currency system reform, it increased to US$5 million in the first month, but after the depreciation of the Gold Yuan, overseas Chinese remittances have been suspended for a month and a half, with accumulated funds exceeding US$6 million. The current official exchange rate differs greatly from the black market price, and overseas Chinese suffer too much loss if they remit money at the official price. If they engage in black market transactions, the government's losses are also substantial, which is not what the overseas Chinese want. However, for the sake of both public and private interests, this accumulation phenomenon should be quickly addressed. Normally, the total monthly overseas Chinese remittances from the entire Philippines are approximately US$15 million, and the total amount of overseas Chinese remittances from the entire Southeast Asia and other parts of the world is truly staggering. In order to enable the government to grasp this large amount of income and to enable overseas Chinese remittances to effectively support their families in the country, they presented the Finance Minister Xu with the unanimous expectations of the overseas Chinese: (1) The official exchange rate can be adjusted with the market price or paid in the original currency. (2) Simplify foreign exchange settlement procedures and eliminate all unnecessary restrictions. Finance Minister Xu replied that the government will improve the overseas Chinese remittance measures in the short term so that overseas Chinese remittances will not suffer losses and will be made as convenient as possible. Lin et al. expressed their deep gratitude for Xu's straightforward reply. They are scheduled to participate in the National Federation of Industries in Shanghai on the 17th before returning to the Philippines via Xiamen to report to all overseas Chinese.

[United Press, Paris, 16th] According to sources close to Lie, the key to whether a four-power summit can be realized lies with President Truman. Therefore, this kind of peaceful communication is more earnestly expected from Truman than from the other three heads of state.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Paris, 16th Broadcast: U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith flew from Paris to Berlin at 3:00 PM on the 16th. A senior embassy official said that Smith's trip was purely private and not on the orders of Marshall. However, it is said that Smith did visit Marshall on the 15th.

[United Press, Berlin, 16th] On the 16th, the Soviet Union officially spread rumors of a peaceful proposal in Berlin for the first time, showing that the Soviet side is willing to reach an agreement on the Berlin issue. The editorial in the 16th edition of the Soviet military newspaper "Daily Review" attacked Western countries for refusing to support the peace proposal. The editorial stated, "Western countries intend to make the Berlin issue a permanent threat to peace. The agreement will end the dual currency and all restrictions and difficulties in Berlin, including the blockade."

[United Press, Paris, 15th] It is reported that Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, President of the Security Council, has completed a draft of a new solution to the Berlin blockade. Sources in "neutral" countries said that this new solution would require the establishment of a "supervisory" committee to guarantee the implementation of the agreement by both the East and West. Although the Western powers have expressed opposition to direct negotiations with the Kremlin, it is generally expected that the three Western countries will welcome any steps taken in the Security Council to resolve the Berlin issue. Informed sources said that the main points of the Argentine Foreign Minister's solution are two: (1) Action should be completed by both the East and West before December 20 or the agreed-upon date. (2) A Security Council committee should be established to supervise the implementation of this solution.

### UN General Assembly Decides to Expedite Work to Conclude Within One Month

[U.S. Information Agency, Paris, 15th] The UN General Assembly today approved a plan to expedite the handling of several items on the agenda in order to conclude this session of the General Assembly within one month. This plan proposes that political issues be handled separately by the Political Committee, the Security Council, and the newly established 58-nation ad hoc committee. Under the new arrangement, the Political Committee will deal with the Palestine issue, the relationship between France and Spain, and the treatment of Indians in South Africa. The committee will begin considering the Palestine issue this month.

The newly established ad hoc committee will consider other political issues, including the Security Council's report on the admission of new member states to the United Nations, the Security Council's voting procedures (including the use of the veto), the report of the Interim Committee (also known as the Little General Assembly) advocating the establishment of a permanent body to continue its work during the recess of the General Assembly, studies on ways to promote international political cooperation, and the UN Secretary-General's proposal to establish a United Nations guard force. During the discussion of the organization of the ad hoc committee, Eastern European countries still suggested that the General Assembly should proceed as usual, but believed that the debate on certain issues should be limited, and that evening meetings should also be added. In addition, the discussion of some issues should be postponed until the next session of the General Assembly to speed up the conclusion of this session. Argentine representative Arce also advocated postponing the discussion and suggested that the General Assembly should end on time at midnight on December 8 as originally planned, and reconvene in February or March next year to discuss all outstanding issues. Some small countries also expressed concern, as the establishment of a new committee and the simultaneous discussion of various political issues would overwhelm the delegations with a small number of people. Eastern European countries voted against it in the vote.

### World Food and Agriculture Conference Opens in Washington

### French Parliament Reconvenes

Government Will Seek Vote of Confidence on Handling of Miners' Strike

[Central News Agency, Paris, 16th, United Press] The French Parliament reconvened this afternoon after a week-long recess. The Wan Yi coalition cabinet will encounter a major storm in both houses. The government is expected to debate the Republican Party's proposal that the government provide concrete evidence of the Communist Party's intelligence bureau funding the French coal miners' strike. The strike has now reached its tenth week. Although there was a return-to-work movement last week, official figures released this morning show that the strike has caused a loss of more than 4.2 million tons of coal production. According to sources close to the cabinet, the government may seek a vote of confidence from parliament on certain issues related to the handling of the coal miners' strike.

[French News Agency, Paris, 15th] The French coal miners' strike reduced France's coal production in October to 508,000 tons. From January to September of this year, the average monthly production was 4.2 million tons.

### UN Security Council Passes Resolution for a Comprehensive Truce in the Holy Land, Urging Negotiations to Define Permanent Borders

[French News Agency, Paris, 16th] The United Nations Security Council, by a vote of eight to one against Syria, with the Soviet Union and Ukraine abstaining, passed a resolution proposed by France, Canada, and Belgium for a comprehensive truce in Palestine. The resolution calls on both the Arab and Jewish sides to conclude a comprehensive truce agreement and to hold direct truce negotiations through the mediation of mediator Bunch. The resolution also stipulates that this truce agreement will define permanent lines that the two belligerent countries cannot cross. It also stipulates all troop withdrawal measures or mutual reduction of troop strength in order to reach a temporary truce period, and then to achieve lasting peace in Palestine.

Before the vote, Israeli representative Eban spoke first, stating that his government supports the Franco-Belgian-Canadian proposal of the 15th concerning the early conclusion of a truce agreement in Palestine and the immediate commencement of negotiations between the two sides. Eban attacked the possible imposition of sanctions if any party in the conflict does not comply with the proposal passed by the Security Council on the 4th of this month and refuses to comply with the order to withdraw troops. Eban said that Israel will not withdraw its troops, because no country can agree to withdraw its troops from two-thirds of its territory. Syrian representative Curry said that the Arab countries are not prepared to comply with the proposal, because negotiating with the Jews is tantamount to recognizing Jewish sovereignty, which the Arab countries will never do. In addition, the Arab countries are unwilling to engage in any special negotiations until the situation in Palestine has been clarified. He also said that although the Jews have gained the upper hand in the initial clashes, it is not yet known who will win the second round of clashes, and the Arab countries are prepared to continue fighting. Representatives from Egypt and Lebanon also made similar speeches.

[United Press, Paris, 16th] The United Nations Security Council today discussed the Palestinian truce plan proposed by Canada. Chinese representative Xu Shuxi expressed his support, but pointed out that this plan seems to focus on facilitating initial peace rather than a comprehensive cessation of fighting. At the same time, the UN General Assembly Political Committee met to discuss the mediation plan of former Palestine mediator Bernadotte. Arab representatives launched a major attack on Bei.

### Opinions on the Ruhr Area Issue Still Differ Among Countries

[French News Agency, London, 15th] The six-nation Ruhr Conference met for three and a half hours today. The divergence of opinions among the countries has become increasingly apparent. According to British officials, the countries have not fully agreed on the future Ruhr control agency and the distribution plan for Ruhr coal, iron, and steel production. However, the specific bottleneck has not been revealed. It is also learned that the sovereignty issue of the Ruhr mining area raised by French representative Alphant at the meeting last Thursday is currently being brokered diplomatically, so this issue may not be raised to the meeting again. However, the French side said that the issue of international control of the Ruhr mining area and Ruhr industry raised by Alphant will still be discussed at the Ruhr Conference after the British and American sides have expressed their positions.

### Fanatical Jewish Stern Gang Warns the Israeli Government

Demanding a Stop to the Arrests of Its Comrades

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 15th] The Israeli extremist Stern Gang issued a "final warning" to the government on the 15th, demanding a stop to the arrests of its members, or it will immediately open an underground organization. This is the first public statement issued by the Stern Gang after it was reported to be involved in the plot to assassinate UN Holy Land mediator Bernadotte and was declared an illegal organization by the Israeli government. The statement accused the government of arresting Stern Gang members in order to "please Marshall, Judd, and other British people." More than a hundred Stern Gang members have been arrested since Bei's assassination, and it has been decided to begin trials on the 28th of this month. At the same time, the Israeli army in the Negrev region continues to attack. According to private reports from the war zone, Egyptian troops have been besieged in Taruga and are now abandoning their baggage to prepare for a breakout.

### Siamese View Comet as Ominous Sign

Siamese Prime Minister Has Doubled His Guard

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 16th] The long-tailed comet discovered by the Nanjing Observatory yesterday morning has also been seen by some early risers here in the past seven days. When the sky is clear, the star is very clear, and its long tail can be seen without a telescope. According to astronomers, the light of a comet's tail is diffuse, but the tail of the comet recently described here has a straight shape. The appearance of this comet has caused a great stir in Siamese political circles.

It is reported that Phibun, the Siamese Prime Minister, who deeply believes in astrology, has doubled his guard to protect his own safety.

### Japanese National Civil Servants Hold Demonstrations

Government Has Decided to Strictly Prohibit Them

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] The All-Japan Confederation of Public Service Employees' Unions is scheduled to hold a demonstration march in Tokyo on the 16th, demanding that the civil service law not be amended and that special treatment be improved. The government authorities strictly prohibit members from participating. Chief Cabinet Secretary Sato issued a statement on the 15th, saying, "If officials at all levels participate in the demonstration on the 16th for the sake of special treatment issues, the government believes that it will hinder the operation of national affairs, and will strictly prohibit it. Each ministry and department should investigate the number of people participating and give them salary reductions and other punishments."

### Yoshida to Announce Dissolution of Diet, Attempting to Restore Imperial Authority; Allied Headquarters Believe Current Cabinet Has No Right to Dissolve Diet

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 16th] Ignoring the well-known wishes of the Allied Headquarters, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida announced to the Diet on the 16th that after the Diet passes the Labor Standards Law Amendment Bill, he will dissolve the Diet and hold a general election again. Officials at the Allied Headquarters believe that Yoshida's move is a clear attempt to undermine the constitution and restore the political power of the Emperor, but they are not yet willing to engage in constitutional debate on the issue of Diet dissolution. They hope that the Japanese people can solve their own problems within the possible range, without the need for Allied intervention.

### Japanese Diet in Chaos

Yoshida Refuses to Deliver Policy Speech, Leaves After Brief Address

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] At the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the afternoon of the 15th, the opposition parties' request that Yoshida deliver a policy speech first was passed. Yoshida said in the House, "The current cabinet is a minority party cabinet formed by more than two hundred blank votes. It is common political sense that this temporary Diet will be dissolved once it meets. However, the purpose of convening this temporary Diet is to deliberate on two or three emergency bills such as the National Public Service Law, which cannot be avoided. Therefore, other bills should not be submitted, and it is natural to dissolve it after the passage of these bills. Although the opposition parties do not intend to force a shortening of the deliberation time, if the deliberation is delayed, it will not only cause obstacles in the operation of national affairs, but also damage Japan's prestige in the world." After speaking, he left the meeting, and the other cabinet members also left the meeting one after another. As a result, the scene was filled with voices of government insincerity, and it fell into chaos. Socialist Party Secretary-General Asanuma reached an agreement requesting Yoshida to return to the House of Representatives. Speaker Matsuoka gently advised him, and then discussed an emergency motion to adjourn the meeting. As a result of the vote, the meeting, which was full of farcical situations, was adjourned at 7:15.

### Execution Date of Tojo and Others Approaching; Precautions Taken in Various Parts of Japan

### Corfu Strait Incident

Albania's Defense

[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 15th] The Albanian representative argued in the International Court of Justice regarding the British accusation that Albanian batteries in the Corfu Strait damaged a British destroyer, that the Albanian batteries only had four medium-sized cannons, and it was impossible for two modern British destroyers not to have received a warning from the Albanian batteries to retreat. Alan's lawyer also said that the British destroyers' navigation route did not retreat to the middle of the strait, which had already been cleared of mines.

According to today's reports, 34,000 miners in Kyushu are on strike, and at least 57,000 miners in Hokkaido are participating. Carpenters in various mines have also responded, adopting a new tactic of not bringing tools to work at all.

U.S. diplomats in Southeast Asia also held a similar meeting in Bangkok in June of this year.

### Dissection of Germany

— Translated by the Editorial Department of This Newspaper

— Translated from the September issue of "The Atlantic Monthly" —

Germany, which three years ago was regarded as a laboratory problem for re-education and control, with its four victorious powers solving it by mutual agreement, has today become the decisive battleground between East and West. If the Western powers can control Berlin, they have the opportunity to restore the industry of West Germany, enable the European Recovery Program to succeed, attract Eastern countries from the Soviet sphere of influence, and finally unite Europe under Western conditions.

In July 1945, the victorious powers of Germany divided it into five parts: four occupation zones and the city of Berlin. They agreed that these five regions should be governed according to common economic and political principles. Now, to meet practical needs, Germany has been divided into three parts: East, West, and the city of Berlin. There is hardly any precedent for such a situation where three parts of the same country are so different.

The Desolate and Barren Soviet Occupation Zone

The Soviet occupation zone, which a famous German newspaper called the "Quiet Zone," is a wasteland, dotted with desolate farms, dilapidated factories, inhabited by 17 million haggard and despairing German residents, and at least 300,000 Soviet soldiers and officials.

The flat grain fields of Mecklenburg, the rolling green hills of Thuringia, the sandy land and pine forests of Brandenburg, the textile and machine industries of Saxony, and the brown coal mines, metallurgical plants, and chemical plants of Saxony-Anhalt, all of this is practically equivalent to a colony annexed by the Soviet Union.

The Soviet occupation zone was originally a rich agricultural area, providing 3,700 calories of heat per person per day. Now, its residents are rationed an average of 1,400 calories per day. The reasons for this difference between past and present are as follows: war losses, lack of fertilizer or transportation to the Soviet Union, the Soviet-style land reform that divided good farms into small, inefficient units, and the Soviet Union's forced requisition of grains, sugar, and livestock. This spring, in order to prevent a real famine, the Soviet Union had to transport back 20,000 tons of the hundreds of thousands of tons of grains they had already transported out.

The famous factories in the Soviet occupation zone only have empty factory buildings left. The broken floors and curved rafters prove the Soviet Union's rough behavior when dismantling the machines. Fifty percent of the industrial capacity of the occupation zone was washed eastward in the summer of 1945; it is feared that only five percent of it was still usable when it reached the Soviet Union. Since then, the dismantling work has not been as careless as before, and at the same time, the Soviet authorities have moved 30,000 German technicians and their families to the Soviet Union along with the factories. Part of the Meissen porcelain factory now ships goods in Tbilisi, and Zeiss lenses and cameras are now manufactured near Moscow and Leningrad.

Thirty percent of Germany's remaining industry is Soviet state-owned factories, all producing for the Soviet Union. The rest, whether bought out and become German public property, or held by a few private individuals, must send 80 to 90 percent of their products to the East.

Difficult to Survive, Impossible to Die

Germany's dilapidated industrial production is decreasing day by day, while the Soviet Union's exploitation remains the same. This area could be more beneficial to the Soviet Union if it were managed properly. The only way to explain why the Soviet Union wants to destroy it is with the Soviet Union's childish incompetence and suspicion.

The Germans living in this area are all miserable, weak, and pitiful worms, truly "difficult to survive, impossible to die." The ubiquitous Soviet secret police and the well-organized German Communist Party agents follow you everywhere, paying attention to your every word. Hundreds of thousands of people have been denounced as "capitalist special agents," "reactionaries," or "Anglo-American spies" for not filling in their words, and all have been sent to Soviet concentration camps, which are located on the original sites of the famous Nazi concentration camps. 200,000 men and women have been sent to the Soviet Union to do hard labor, and another 25,000 have been sent to the uranium mines in southern Saxony to mine ore for atomic bomb experiments for the mining union.

The brown Nazi dictatorship has been replaced by the red Soviet dictatorship. Communist propaganda boasts of a national chauvinism as fanatical as Goebbels, using more or less the same wording. A few weeks ago, it was revealed that the vehement anti-American articles published in the German newspaper Taegliche Rundschau printed by the Soviets were completely copied from a Nazi pamphlet published in 1942. The average German is not surprised by this.

Since Soviet communism's nationalism cannot win the trust of the German people, it has specially created a party for former Nazis to make their emotions tend towards the Soviet Union. But the basic feeling of the Germans in the Soviet occupation zone is only hatred for the Soviet Union, expressed in a strong and powerless German nationalism, and a deep hatred for everything from the East.

West Germany is Reviving

The land across the Iron Curtain to the east is dying and lifeless. The Germany to the west of the Iron Curtain is reviving, although not in a balanced way, but in a down-to-earth way. After the recent currency reform, store windows were suddenly filled with hoardings that had come out of hiding. American cigarettes, which were regarded as a barometer of the black market, fell from West Marks to 40 Pfennig, almost equal to the legal price. Regular monthly imports of 300,000 tons of Anglo-American food and more than $1 billion in Marshall Plan aid are sufficient to further improve the lives of the West German people.

The basic food ration is not sufficient, but the large amount of black market food sold by farms preserves the health of the general public and makes the farmers wealthy. In the past, the rampant and indispensable black market made it impossible for countless Germans to survive. Now the situation is different, because after the currency reform, the amount of currency has decreased, and they seem to be relieved. The new currency, called the Deutsche Mark, has gained the trust of the public, giving them hope for economic stability.

If the cruelty of the Soviet Union has caused intense hatred, then the amazing generosity of the West has been met with nitpicking criticism. The German appetite is a bottomless pit; the food supplied by the British and Americans is never enough, and the styles cannot satisfy him. In addition, "no matter what, it always comes from Germany." Regardless of the $1 billion in U.S. aid, rumors are still circulating that German industrial competition will be eliminated.

General Clay, commander of the U.S. forces in the general territory, painstakingly fought for this aid for Germany, but was seen as "anti-German," while his enthusiastic subordinates were denounced as "a group of Jewish refugees."

The Ruhr Area, the Industrial Heart

The voices of opposition from the right and left to the international co-management of the Ruhr area, which was agreed upon in London, are growing louder. Miners have become the target of agitation, and they hear appeals that if Germany cannot fully control its coal and steel, or Moscow cannot share a piece, then it is better not to produce. In response to this propaganda, plans to supply food to encourage miners have increased coal production (but not high enough for a real recovery) and reduced the power of the Communist Party (but not low enough for real security). Steel production is about one-third of the ten million tons allowed to be produced in Germany.

After the terrible bombing, factories and mines in the Ruhr area need capital and equipment, and workers need housing. In addition to material recovery, the Ruhr area also needs spiritual tranquility. Steel mills and coal mines have been bought out by the British, so neither labor nor capital has a real incentive to increase production. The socialization of the Ruhr area's industry has a long way to go to achieve the goals of curbing communism, weakening the German nationalist faction, and training workers who are either indifferent or disruptive into responsible citizens.

Apart from the Ruhr area, Bavaria is permeated with Catholic power and resents northern Germany. Hanseatic wistfully regrets that its shipping industry was taken away by Bremen. Schleswig-Holstein sighs at the two million refugees it has to support. The French occupation zone practices self-reliance under the careful planning of the French military government. Undoubtedly, the West German people are unwilling to organize a government that the Western powers allow them to organize, mostly due to this psychological independence. "Unification of Germany" is certainly a powerful slogan, but the inconceivable selfishness is also a strong fact.

The Social Democratic Party of Berlin

Is there any sign that Germany is becoming a democratic country? As in the time of the German Emperor or the Weimar Republic, the German Social Democratic Party constitutes the only strong democratic force in the country.

When the general election was held in October 1946, the Soviet Union deliberately eliminated the Social Democratic Party in its stronghold, which won nearly half of the votes. Since then, the party's strength has gradually increased. The party has repeatedly opposed the Communist Party's terrorist acts with strong and public protests, and has made Berliners raise their heads by advocating free thought. Many Social Democratic Party officials have been kidnapped by the Soviet side, beaten by German Communist Party thugs, and intimidated or dismissed by both sides. The party has never compromised, and neither has the city of Berlin.

The German Socialist Party is certainly not acting alone. Their Western adversaries, the Christian Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Party, are united in the anti-communist front in the city government. The party has shown extreme calm and unyielding attitude under the Soviet blockade policy, and has similarly gained the trust of the Berlin people.

Life in Berlin has a frontier style. It also has its dark side - the corruption of the black market, terrible crimes, and speculation. But it also has its bright side - extensive social activities, deep friendships, mutual assistance between comrades, provocative environment, tense and complex work, rapid pace, and a spirit of concerted effort. Berlin life has no age or nationality distinction, only the boundary between East and West. In the eyes of Berliners, Berlin is still Berlin. In appearance, it is a dead city, but in spirit, it is alive and well. Today's Berlin is the political key to controlling Europe, just as West Germany is the economic key to controlling Europe.

### City Middle School Teachers and Staff Take Collective Leave Yesterday; Resume Teaching This Morning After Mayor's Persuasion; City Government to Discuss Welfare Issues at a Meeting This Afternoon

[Our Report] Due to difficult living conditions, the Municipal Middle School Teachers and Staff Association previously submitted an urgent relief request to the city government. Although Speaker Pan, Education Bureau Director Li, and various municipal middle school principals actively intervened and persuaded, no results were achieved. Consequently, 1,200 teachers and staff from 31 municipal middle schools decided at a joint meeting of directors, supervisors, and school representatives the night before last to take collective leave for one week starting yesterday and issued an open letter to the public and parents of students. At 3 PM, another meeting of directors and supervisors was held at Gezhi Middle School, where Mayor Wu, Director Li, and municipal middle school principals went to persuade them. The meeting continued until after 8 PM, when it was decided to accept the Mayor's persuasion and resume teaching this morning. However, in reality, some staff had already returned to their hometowns or were not notified in time, so formal resumption of classes would only be possible in the afternoon or tomorrow. Mayor Wu also scheduled a meeting at the city government at 3 PM today to discuss teacher and staff welfare issues.

Yesterday afternoon at 6 PM, Mayor Wu addressed the joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the Middle School Teachers and Staff Association, stating that everyone knows the hardship of public school teachers and staff. While the cost of living index for workers is 8.1 times higher, it is only 2.5 times higher for public school teachers and staff.

### Demanding Reconciliation; Prostitutes Gather Crowd to Commit Assault

[Our Newspaper Report] Hongbao, formerly a prostitute in the Yunshang Brothel, was later transferred to the Jincheng Brothel and renamed Shanshan. In the 34th year of the Republic of China, she had an affair with Zhang Hongchun, who opened the Xingji Sauce Garden at No. 201 Dantu Road, and cohabited at No. 10 Sailong Lane, East Yuhang Road. Later, because of the woman's misconduct, Zhang was dissatisfied and broke off the relationship in June last summer. The woman then became a private prostitute, often entering and leaving small hotels. Recently, due to the rising cost of living, she was unable to support herself due to poverty. The day before yesterday, she returned to Zhang's place to demand a reconciliation. After Zhang sternly refused, she left unhappily. Unexpectedly, at 4:00 PM yesterday, the woman gathered more than 20 thugs, including four holding pistols, to Zhang's place to extort 20,000 Gold Yuan. When they failed, they beat and insulted Zhang and injured his head with the butt of a gun, causing continuous bleeding. After someone reported to the Flying Fortress, the thugs dispersed in a hubbub. Only Hongbao was arrested and taken to the Tilanqiao Police Branch for punishment according to the law.

### Resolution of the Customs Strike; Employees Receive Half-Month's Salary as Loan

Regarding the strike of Jianghai Customs employees, the Municipal Government and the Garrison Department sent Wang Zhaoquan and He Longqing to persuade them at 10:00 AM yesterday. Afterwards, Customs Commissioner Zhang Yongnian repeatedly summoned the heads of various departments to do their best to疏导. According to the employees' opinion, the two斗of rice, one bag of flour, and two斤of cooking oil that the authorities planned to issue were of no help. They requested a loan of some cash to supplement their daily expenses. After Zhang consulted the authorities, the result was that another half-month's new salary was allocated to help with the urgent needs. The employees agreed and decided to resume work uniformly starting today. However, the employees still hope that the authorities will request the Ministry of Finance to adjust their treatment to be equal to that of the four banks as a goal. It is reported that the main work such as closing customs and inspecting ships was still carried out as usual during the strike period, and the backlog of cases will be handled as soon as possible after the resumption of work.

### Mint Opens to Cast Gold Bars; Deposits Exchanged for Gold and Silver to Be Implemented Soon

[Our Newspaper Report] Director Wei of the Central Mint, who went to Nanjing earlier to ask Finance Minister Xu for instructions on the mint's future policy, returned to Shanghai on the 15th. He told reporters that the mint started casting gold bars today (16th). The weights are divided into three types: five qian, one liang, and ten liang. The current output is 2,000 large and small bars per day. From next month, it can be increased to 5,000 to 10,000 bars. As for the opening of casting gold and silver coins, it is still in the planning stage. The original one-fen steel coins and five-jiao silver coins have been ordered to stop casting.

[Our Newspaper Report] It is reported that the detailed rules for the implementation of deposit exchange for gold and silver have been carefully discussed by the heads of various bureaus and departments of the Central Bank and were finally approved on the 15th. Yesterday, Vice President Liu of the bank took it to Nanjing for approval. If approved, it is expected to be implemented starting from the 22nd. It is heard that the gold allocated for deposit exchange this time is made from gold bricks purchased by the Central Bank from the United States, not from the gold exchanged from the people. The batch of gold bricks has been allocated to the Central Mint in batches by the Central Bank to melt into gold bars, divided into three types: five qian, one liang, and ten liang, with a fineness of one thousandths. After the exchange rules are approved, it is expected to start exchanging at the same time in 25 cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Hankou, Ping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Yunnan, and Guiyang starting from the 22nd. In Shanghai, in addition to the National Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China will be commissioned to exchange at the same time. In other cities, the Central Bank will temporarily exchange exclusively. In the future, the exchange agencies will be added as needed.

### Money Market First Loose, Then Tight

Central Bank Issues 20 Yuan Notes

The trend of money market funds became looser yesterday. Supply from various industries turned prosperous, and turnover was unusually flexible. The market's implicit interest rate also fell, around 25 to 40 yuan per thousand yuan per day, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 7.5 fen to 1.2 yuan. The industry's firms have resumed lending, which has a particularly large impact on the market. Until near noon, it turned tight again, rising by 5%.

[Another Report] The firm trend of cash has gradually declined due to the Central Bank's supply of large quantities of 50 yuan to 100 yuan notes in recent days. The Central Bank also issued a 20 yuan note yesterday. The note is green and was printed by the American Banknote Company in 1945. The front has the late Chairman Lin's photo. Yesterday's surface discount fell to 50 yuan per thousand yuan.

### Private Trade with Japan; Barter Trade Has Export Surplus

[Our Newspaper Report] According to the Export Control Commission, after the opening of private trade with Japan, the government has been extremely cautious in management. At present, cash transactions are limited to exports, and applications for cash imports are generally prohibited. Other transactions are handled by barter. As of now, the value of goods exported by barter trade has reached US$663,919.97, while the value of goods imported is only US$74,670.87. Compared, there is an export surplus of US$589,249.1. The exported goods are mostly agricultural products, with wheat bran and castor bean cake being the main items. The only imported item is rayon. A table of the quantities and values of various imported and exported goods is listed below. Imported goods: Rayon 470 boxes, US$74,670.87. Exported goods: Wheat bran 2,836 tons, US$246,588.00, castor beans 192.5 tons, US$110,687.50, bean cake 965 tons, US$102,350.00, hemp 100 tons, US$83,756.73, broad beans 400 tons, US$46,100.00, pig bristles 50 boxes, also 10,000 pounds, US$34,433.34, tung oil 35 tons, US$23,905.00, asphalt 30 tons, US$16,199.40.

### Silk Soars

The rayon market yesterday was first high and then soft. People were optimistic, and the floating parties tried their best to push it up. Local gangs also started to add to the buying, and the asking price went straight up. Later, because the account holders sold at high prices, the customer gangs' willingness to accept turned weak, and the actual sales were not good. The trend was high and then soft, and the closing price saw an upward trend. The opening price of No. 120 Tianqiao was 12,000 and 13,000 yuan, and the incoming households were watching. Although the area tried its best to pull it up, in the end, the footing was weak and the people's hearts were not firm. The market price instantly returned to the 10,000 yuan mark and ended. The ups and downs of the remaining righteous goods also followed closely, and the results saw a slight natural rise. In the afternoon, the asking price outside the market saw another peak, and the market's heart was suddenly silent. Various objects outside the industry also tended to be firm, but there were not many transactions after the asking price.

The raw silk market followed the ups and downs of rayon, and the trend was first high and then soft, and the closing price returned to low again. The local silk weaving industry's acceptance of superior grade retail was not weak. The initial opening trend was sharp. After the price rose, the account holders sold one after another. With more supply than demand, all parties watched again. The asking price went step by step downstream, and the market price fell to the previous day's closing price. The account holders did not sell, and the result was a slight increase of several hundred yuan. At first, silk and satin rose due to the soaring prices of raw materials, and everyone was optimistic. The asking price was either not raised or high. The initial opening price of duvet cover was 7,500 and 8,000 yuan. After the high price, the factory sold it continuously, and the customer gangs' acceptance was light. The industry dumped it, and the market conditions softened. Later, because the money market was loose, the local acceptance reopened, and the closing price rose again. In the afternoon, due to rumors, the people's hearts turned silent, and the asking price was chaotic.

### Yarn Prices Stop Rising and Turn Down; Cotton Cloth Trend Also Sees a Decline

Yesterday's yarn and cloth outside the market, because the finished product sales of the replication manufacturers were not smooth, and it was heard that the Central Bank was tightening the money market very severely, all parties' funds were still tight, and there was continued sales secretly, so the asking price stopped rising and turned down.

42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn, because the previous day's surge was too large, retail investors sold it, and finally returned to 8,900 yuan to end, a drop of 1,400 yuan from the previous day. Those for delivery tomorrow were at 10,300 yuan.

40-count Jincheng 9,000 yuan, 32-count Silver Moon 8,400 yuan, 21-count Double Horse yarn yarn merchants sold to each other, replication manufacturers watched, the asking price stepped down to 7,500 yuan, still lacking buyers, a drop of 300 yuan from the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell, and the market trend was quite tired.

Yesterday's cotton cloth, the initial asking price outside the market followed the sharp trend of the previous day, and someone wanted to buy the leading fine cloth for 365 yuan. Later, it was heard that the government would exchange as much gold as possible, so that a large number of Gold Yuan certificates would return to the market, and the market's funds were still tight. Most of the holders were pessimistic, and the customer gangs' destocking was also sluggish. Moreover, it was time for spinning to be allocated, so the asking price was unable to hold on.

The leading fine cloth stepped down from 365 yuan to 310 yuan at the close, a drop of 55 yuan from the previous day. Four Gentlemen drills were also sold at a slight price of 315 yuan. 190 high-grade Shilin cloth was offered at 600 yuan, but buyers were lacking and the market atmosphere was sluggish.

### Rice Price Increase; Flour, Oil, and Other Grains All Rebound

After a sharp decline in rice prices in this city over the past few days, the market rebounded by 10% yesterday. This was because underground interest rates in the market had retreated to the 100 yuan mark. Yesterday, 50-60 yuan could buy a large amount of rice. It was also rumored that itinerant sellers were continuously arriving in Shanghai. With most companies having paid out salaries and wages, general purchasing power has increased, and various parties are actively replenishing their rice stocks while prices are low.

The market opening yesterday was relatively calm. After 10 o'clock, many rice dealers began bidding aggressively, and prices soared. In the northern market, *bai geng* rice was at 470 yuan, and *bao dao* rice was at 480 yuan. In the southern market, *bai geng* rice was at 450 yuan, and *bao dao* rice was the same price as in the northern market. Early rice was at 450 yuan, and *du xian* rice was at 390 yuan. Total arrivals in both markets were 2,875 *shi* and 2.25 *dou*.

Many customers in the flour market were actively buying, and dealers were holding firm. Factories were not offering much supply, and the market rose by about 30 yuan. Old car flour was at 160 yuan, naval vessel flour was at 150 yuan, and Fuxin bran was at 107 yuan.

Cooking oil also rose with rice flour. Soybean oil was at 900 yuan. Only Jiangbei pure raw oil was available, at 1,300 yuan. Small cart sesame oil was at 900 yuan, and soybean cake was at 80 yuan. Transactions were also more active than yesterday.

### Canton-Hankow Railway's Eight Lines: Virgin Mining Territory

— Our Reporter Mao Shukui

[Our Report] Among the national railways currently, apart from the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, the Canton-Hankow Railway is the only one that can be self-sufficient. In this turbulent era, this major artery connecting Central and Southern China is of utmost military importance, and its economic value is even more worthy of our attention. In October 1938, Guangzhou and Hankou fell successively. At that time, President Chiang Kai-shek personally instructed Du Zhenyuan, Director of the Canton-Hankow Railway Bureau, to thoroughly destroy the railway to the point where the enemy could not repair and use it within six months. This order paralyzed the Canton-Hankow Railway for a full decade. In December 1946, President Chiang summoned Director Du to Nanjing again, ordering him to repair the entire line within six months. On July 1, 1947, the employees of the Canton-Hankow Railway completed the engineering work that the enemy had been unable to complete in ten years, painstakingly connecting 1,300 kilometers of steel rails. Although the US aid funds had been reduced from 4,200 gold yuan to 500 gold yuan, and this meager 500 gold yuan was still in the planning stages, the Canton-Hankow Railway had already become self-reliant at this time, improving and rebuilding step by step, and embarking on the road to recovery. Before June of this year, more than 500 temporary bridges had been replaced with steel bridges. All of this is thanks to the employees of the Canton-Hankow Railway, but it also illustrates the value of the Canton-Hankow Railway itself.

The Canton-Hankow Railway passes through many mineral-rich areas, such as iron in Leiyang, Youxian, Ningxiang in Hunan Province, and Daye in Hubei Province; antimony in Yizhang, Xinhua, and Yiyang; lead and zinc in Chenxian, Linwu, and Changning, and coal mines scattered throughout the provinces. The Canton-Hankow Railway authorities are well aware that their future prospects depend entirely on the development of these many natural resources. The Railway Bureau is now fully assisting in the development of various coal mines, building railway branch lines directly to the mining areas to facilitate transportation. More than 150 kilometers of branch lines have been approved by the Ministry of Communications or are under construction, totaling eight lines: (1) Baiyang Branch Line: from Baishidu to Yangmeishan Hunan Coal Mine, the entire line is about 15 kilometers long, built during the Anti-Japanese War. The Canton-Hankow Railway's southern section relies heavily on this area for coal supply, currently producing 600 tons per day, with plans to expand to 1,000 tons. (2) Xiangjiang Branch Line: from Xianghekou to Yangjiaqiao Xiangjiang Coal Mine. This line was newly built after the restoration. It produces 500 tons of coal per day. The Canton-Hankow Railway's northern section obtains coal from here and is currently planning to use US aid to expand, hoping to increase production to 2,500 tons per day in the future. (3) Zixing Branch Line: This existed before the war but was destroyed and is awaiting funding for repairs. (4) Nanling Branch Line:

With the help of Chairman Soong Tzu-wen, the section from Pingshi to Nanling is currently under active construction. There are two mines in this area: Baziling and Gouyadong. It is expected that after one year, the two mines can produce 1,000 tons of coal per day. (5) Zhongxiang Branch Line: from Xiashankou to Tanjia Shan Zhongxiang Coal Mine, the total length is more than 20 kilometers, awaiting funding for construction. (6) Huxiang Branch Line: from Xiangtan to Luojiatang Huxiang Coal Mine, which has been approved by the Ministry of Communications and is awaiting funding for construction. It currently produces 170 tons of coal per day and is expected to expand to 3,000 tons in the future. (7) Xiangtan-Xinhua Line: Once this line is built, there will be five coal mines that can be exploited: Hongshangdian, Enkou, Fengguanshan, Mingjingjing, and Yanjiapu. (8) The Liling, Pingxiang, and Gaokeng mining areas are all connected to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in Zhuzhou. The three mines currently produce 1,500 tons per day. If these eight branch lines are completed, the Canton-Hankow Railway will have a daily coal production of 20,000 tons. Not only will the Canton-Hankow Railway and the industrial coal demand in South China no longer be a concern, but there will also be a surplus to solve part of the coal shortage in the Shanghai-Nanjing area. At that time, the transportation business of the Canton-Hankow Railway will also flourish. The completion of this plan is not too far away. The Canton-Hankow Railway Bureau plans to build so many branch lines within two years. Of course, solving the transportation problem alone is not enough. At the same time, the local economic strength of Hunan and Hubei provinces is not sufficient to develop these many mineral resources on a large scale. They earnestly hope that entrepreneurs with vision from all over the country and overseas Chinese can invest here and jointly develop this virgin mining territory.

### Guangzhou Power Plant Site Selected: Two Villages in Henan

Villagers Push Representatives to File Administrative Appeal

[Our Report from Guangzhou, 12th (Airmail)] More than 70 *mu* of farmland in the villages of Nantoushi and Diyuan in Henan, Guangzhou, have been publicly announced by the Guangzhou Municipal Government to be requisitioned for the site of the Guangzhou Power Plant. The people of the two villages are extremely dissatisfied. They believe that east of the Nantoushi Provincial Paper Mill, there are earthen mounds and barren land that stretches for several miles, mostly government-owned wasteland. It faces the Pearl River in the front and is connected to the highway in the back. The site is spacious, elevated, and flat, with convenient transportation. Moreover, the Municipal Government's Design Committee had long designated this area and dozens of *li* of land along the river to the east as an industrial zone. This government-owned wasteland is a natural factory site. If a factory is built there, it will not only reduce the compensation for land requisition but also avoid disrupting agricultural production, benefiting both public and private interests. Now, the Municipal Government is abandoning this natural government-owned factory site and insisting on requisitioning as much farmland as possible from the two villages, which 40-odd households and more than 300 people depend on for their livelihoods. This not only violates the law and harms farmers but also goes against the government's intention to support farmers and increase production. They have elected representatives Xie Mingde, Wu Sen, and Liang Hede to file an administrative appeal to fight for their survival.

### The Black Current in Jiangxi

— Our Reporter Liu Zao

[Our Report from Nanchang, 13th (Express)] The security situation in Jiangxi at the current stage, since the provincial authorities decided to suppress clan fighting in various counties and stop factional struggles, is indeed much quieter than it was half a year ago. Although the incidents that occur in this kind of physical fighting among uneducated people and nervous infighting among intellectuals are only local disputes, the internal struggle will affect the tranquility of a county or even the entire province. For example, the clan fighting in Yuqian was stopped by Wu Chuikun, the chief of staff sent by the Provincial Security Command. The weapons confiscated from both sides, in terms of light and heavy machine guns alone, amounted to 30, and rifles numbered 212. The loss of life and property caused by these weapons in physical combat is considerable. Furthermore, the time spent on clan fighting and the number of people mobilized to participate in the war are also frightening. Last year, in the Battle of Fenyi, the front lines where both sides were waiting in strict formation extended for two to three hundred *li*. The number of people mobilized included those from related counties such as Xinyu, Wanzai, Shanggao, and Yichun, or those of the same clan. Regardless of men, women, old, or young, those encountered on the battlefield were treated as "enemies," captured and killed without question!

Gang Activities

Let's look at the activities of gangs and the actual harm they cause to the local area. This is indeed a "major landmine" in Jiangxi. Since the formation of the so-called New Social Enterprise Construction Association last year, people who are accustomed to engaging in political activities or attempting to use it as a political capital for competition have taken this opportunity to infiltrate, engaging in personal secret activities, recruiting followers, and even ambitious people who already have considerable status in society are willing to kneel and worship, to become disciples, and call them "big brother." The common people in the countryside are also confused and drawn in by these people. Otherwise, if you are an honest and law-abiding person, they will make it impossible for you to be "honest." The activities of these elements have formed a huge "black current" in cities and towns. Not only do the common people not dare to disobey, but even the county government can do nothing about them. For example, my hometown—Taihe—is a stronghold of these rampant elements. The people in the county government are all in the circle, and even the deputy commander of the Security Command is the mastermind behind the scenes. What can the common people say? They can only listen to their arrangements!

The provincial authorities are determined to eliminate these hegemonic forces for the benefit of society. First, they used heavy troops to clear the countryside in Taihe, exposing the gang members and revealing a conspiracy of theirs: the gang members attempted to collude with Li Jishen in Guinan to transport guns to Taihe, preparing to occupy Jinggangshan, the old nest of Zhu and Mao, with underground workers of the local bandits.

Now, clan fighting incidents are relatively calm, and they dare not openly command the troops, set up strict formations, and rush to kill as if facing a formidable enemy. Since the countryside was cleared in Taihe and several gang leaders were arrested and severely punished, this trend has also been slightly curbed. However, the roots of these two "black tides" are still buried in every corner of Jiangxi, and the local activities of bandit elements are equally worrisome. Everyone knows that Jiangxi was the base area where Zhu and Mao raised their banner 20 years ago. So many "old Jiangxi folks" were dragged into the bandit ranks by these two devils. Not to mention those who died, there are also those who are still alive and serving as cadres in the bandit army. Therefore, Jiangxi may be considered their "hometown" by them. Here is a report based on official intelligence about the bandits around Jiangxi:

Underground Bandits

As mentioned earlier, the current local security problems in Jiangxi include clan fighting, factionalism, and gang hegemony, forming a general "black current" that endangers local security. Therefore, the bandits are more likely to use these internal hegemonies to engage in their underground activities.

At present, although there are no bandit armies or local communists active in the core areas of Jiangxi, the evil seeds of the bandits have been planted around the borders with neighboring provinces, developing from underground activities into banditry, robbery, propaganda, and organization.

In southern Jiangxi, the area was formerly the activity range of the bandit's Guangdong-Eastern Detachment. Now, they have renamed themselves the Guangdong-Jiangxi-Zhejiang Border Area People's Liberation General Detachment, with Huang Ye as the commander, Liu Xinchao as the deputy commander, and Shao Guoliang as the detachment leader, totaling nearly 1,000 men. After several maneuvers, they sometimes confront in groups and sometimes break up into smaller units, hiding deep in the mountains and harassing the border areas of the three provinces. They are still based in Yushan Maozifeng. Liu Xionghu's unit occasionally robs in Guidong, Rucheng, and Suichuan in the border areas of Zhejiang and Jiangxi. Liu's bandits' attempt to occupy this area is, on the one hand, to harass the southern section of the Canton-Hankow Railway when necessary, and on the other hand, to take the opportunity to enter Jinggangshan to establish the so-called Western Jiangxi base area.

Guangfeng and Chong'an in eastern Jiangxi are the base areas of the bandit Wang Wenbo's unit. He currently has 120 men and frequently appears in the Jiangxi-Fujian border area, being suppressed in one place and fleeing to another. As for Xiong Zhaoren's unit, calling himself the "Commander of the Soviet-Zhejiang-Anhui-Jiangxi Border Area People's Liberation Army," has 500 men and occupies the areas of Yi County, Zhanggong Mountain, Shuilanshan, Huangcun, and Daxin Mountain in Anhui, occasionally harassing Dexing and Fuliang in Jiangxi.

Northern Jiangxi Area

The Mufu Mountains in northern Jiangxi are an ideal base area in the border area of Zhejiang, Hubei and Jiangxi. They can invade the Jiujiang-Nanchang Railway to the east, peek at Xianning and Wuhan in southern Hubei to the west, and Changhe, an important town in northern Zhejiang. According to investigations by responsible parties, underground workers of the bandits have already been spotted in this area, engaging in military organization. However, the areas of Xiushui and Tonggu in Jiangxi are fortunately safe.

However, the threat to northern Jiangxi now comes from Huangmei and Guangji in northern Jiangxi, that is, the Dabie Mountains area. The poisonous bacteria and local communists left behind by Liu Bocheng, calling themselves Commander Wang Linsheng of the Hubei-Henan Military Region, and Zhang Guoquan, the commander of the First Military Subdistrict, are responsible for the Huanggang area in eastern Hubei, as well as Zhao Xinchu, the so-called administrative commissioner of eastern Hubei stationed in Qinan, Ma Qi, the commander of the backbone regiment, and Zou Yiqing and Cai Qiong, local communists in Huanggang. Their current strength is about 5,000 men, and the number of guns and bullets is unknown. In the middle of last month, more than 3,000 men from Zhang Guoquan's unit once roamed the area north of Huanggang, and at the time, we speculated that they might want to use the usual trick of "big eating small" to "eat" our security regiment in Konglonglongping and Wuxue on the banks of the Yangtze River. Therefore, the Jiangxi Provincial Security Command immediately dispatched three regiments to northern Jiangxi to strengthen defenses and prepare to prevent them from fleeing south. However, after Zhang's unit robbed part of the grain and cotton in Dahepu, Jingzhupu, and Houshanpu in the area north of Huanggang, they saw the strengthening of the river defense forces and did not dare to try, and returned to Da Yangmiao, Tongzihe Lotus Nunnery, Liu Gonghe, and the original occupied areas to engage in reorganization.

[Reply to Mr. Qian Zicheng from Guangzhou] Regarding the matter of changing your name, the Ministry of Interior has promulgated regulations. Students at all levels of schools who apply to change their name must also comply with the restrictions promulgated by the Ministry of Education, that is, it is limited to cases where the name is completely identical within the scope of the school's location and is easily confused. It is also limited to students of public or registered private schools. Students of unregistered private schools will not be accepted.

[Reply to Mr. Zhang Youjiao] Since your elder cousin has reached adulthood, she can make her own decisions about marriage, and her mother cannot object. However, your maternal aunt is nearly 70 years old, and your elder cousin will be alone after marriage, lacking someone to care for her. Your elder cousin and her future brother-in-law have a legal and moral obligation to support her.

[Reply to Mr. Ding Yongnian from Nanjing] The creditor's request to calculate based on the price of rice has no legal basis. The debtor's investment to calculate official interest is also unrealistic and unreasonable. It seems that seeking a fair and reasonable solution through mediation is the best strategy.

[Reply to Mr. Zhang Xiangxian from Shanghai] Your nephew has registered his household at your place and has a national identity card, so he should enjoy the rights and bear the obligations that citizens are entitled to. Even if he does not stay at your place every night, this is the freedom of residence of the people, which is clearly stipulated in the Constitution. If he has not registered his household repeatedly elsewhere, then how can the village chief interfere with his freedom of residence and deprive him of the rights he should enjoy?

[Reply to Ms. Youlan] In response to the two questions you asked, attorney Jiang Pingdang answers as follows: (1) An application for parole should be made to the prison warden. (2) The date of imprisonment and the date of prohibition should be calculated together. If the case has been under review for more than one year and two months, an application for bail can be made to the original court.

### Imitation and Counterfeit

— Xi

Commerce values morality, but in order to maximize profits, it rarely takes morality into account. Therefore, the "gentleman's country" style will always be just a mirage in the "Romance of the Flowers in the Mirror."

The lack of morality in commerce includes fraud, such as selling inferior goods at inflated prices. Imitation and the use of similar names or trademarks of other businesses constitute infringement.

The Commercial Registration Law clearly stipulates that in the same city or county, one cannot use the name of a business that has already been registered by another. The Trademark Law also clarifies that a registered trademark has exclusive rights. However, in this society, the most blatant violation of the law is the imitation and use of "business names" or "trademarks."

Regarding imitation: if you use "Two Three Cats" as a trademark, I will use "Three Tigers." If you are called "Yellow Mazi," I will call myself "Wang Mazi." The use of similar names is even more common and easily found. The most common is that "Lu Gao Jian" has come to represent "butcher shops," and Cantonese restaurants must each have a "Zhengxing Restaurant." I have never understood why the original creators do not file lawsuits with the court based on Article 22 of the Commercial Registration Law or Article 37 of the Trademark Law. Perhaps in fact, everyone is a counterfeit, so in many "genuine" "old shops," who is the "original old shop" is just like the same storefront signs of the two Ya Li shops across from the "Great Stage," only "God knows."

There was a type of "××× Flower Dew Cologne" that was popular before the war and indeed had effects (removing dampness and reducing swelling). After the victory, in order to treat mosquito bites for my child, I bought a bottle, but it had no effect after application. I thought that the product might have been made with shoddy materials or stored for too long, causing a chemical reaction and eliminating the effect. It wasn't until the original producer of the "××× Flower Dew Cologne" published a notice in the newspaper that I learned that the exclusive right to use the trademark had expired during the war and had not been renewed in time, resulting in it being used by others.

In addition, a chemical factory produced "mosquito coils" with a brand that was very similar to a famous trademark of an old business, which aroused attacks from the industry. I don't know what its own quality is, but because of its despicable imitation, I would rather buy other new brand products. Unexpectedly, another product of the factory, "×× Soap," was of very high quality. From this, I inferred that the mosquito coils produced might not be too bad. However, because of the imitation of other people's trademarks, people are unwilling to buy it, which is something that the imitator did not expect.

Based on the above two facts, we know that as long as the products are excellent, there is no need to imitate or use the famous shop names and trademarks of others. Conversely, even if the imitation is successful (such as a product that has already enjoyed a good reputation, the trademark is not registered, or the exclusive right has expired), and the product is inferior, it will at most make people suffer once.

However, to fundamentally eliminate the immorality of imitation and use of similar names, only customers themselves can eliminate the blind worship of "old brands" with the mentality of "only recognizing the sign and not looking at the goods"; otherwise, it is the customers themselves who suffer.

### Silver Seal of the Former Qing Imperial Library

— Miao Zibin

The other day, I read Ling Ruohai's *Aoge Tan Hui*, which mentioned the seals used by the abdicated Qing Dynasty. Here, I will talk about the silver seal of the Imperial Library, which I think those who talk about the anecdotes of the abdicated Qing Dynasty will also be happy to hear.

My late father, Yifeng, disagreed with the principal of the Hanlin Academy, Xu Tong, in the Guangxu year of Jiawu (1894) and asked for leave to return to the countryside. He devoted himself to the study of epigraphy and bibliography for 30 years. When Zhang Wenxiang (Zhidong) was appointed as Grand Secretary, he repeatedly invited him to come out of seclusion. In May of the first year of Xuantong, the Ministry of Education submitted a memorial appointing him as the Director of the Imperial Library, with Xu Wusheng (Fang) as the Deputy Director. Telegrams and letters were sent back and forth, urging him to take office. He arrived in Beijing in September of the second year, but Zhang Wenxiang had already passed away the year before. At that time, the library had not yet been built and was opened in Guanghua Temple on Jishuitan in the northern part of the city. The books were all taken from the large warehouse of the Cabinet, and the old books of the Song and Yuan Dynasties were ancient and fragrant. In the winter of that year, the ministry issued a seal, a silver square, with the inscription "Seal of the Imperial Library." This official position was newly established, the same as the Director of the Imperial College, both being substantive positions, so the seal was square and made of silver. My late father often joked about this, saying that he had also been a *zheng yin* official (all those with square seals were *zheng yin* officials). In the following year, Xinhai (1911), the revolution was successful, and the Qing court abdicated. This seal was in use for less than a year, making it the shortest-lived of the seals, and I am afraid it was also the last silver seal cast by the Qing Ministry.

### Single People

— Zhong Jian

From a medical and national standpoint, late marriage and singlehood are both harmful. Therefore, Europe has historically had laws restricting singlehood.

In the year 9 AD, the Roman Emperor Augustus stipulated by law that single people had no right to inherit property, and even married couples without children could not inherit each other's property. Sparta and Athens imposed fines on single people, the purpose of which was, of course, to encourage marriage and increase fertility.

England adopted a taxation approach. A law in 1695 stipulated that single people and childless widowers should pay an annual tax ranging from one shilling to twelve pounds and ten shillings, depending on the severity of their circumstances. In 1785, a bill was passed to impose heavy taxes on single servants as well. In recent years, with the implementation of income tax, married people with children are taxed lightly, while single people pay higher tax rates.

### Yang Haosou's Manuscripts

— Qian Dacheng

Yang Haosou was renowned throughout the country for his skill in small seal script. His writings, however, were never published, and his descendants disseminated them widely throughout Jiangnan. I once obtained his manuscript of "Annotations on Guanzi" and his hand-annotated "Inscriptions on Bronzes and Tripods from the Jigu Studio." A few years ago, due to financial difficulties, I sold them for rice. Wang Junlin, on the other hand, obtained his hand-annotated "Five Readings of Zhuangzi," and the Shen family has an even larger collection of his manuscripts. This autumn, I borrowed a large volume of Haosou's collected works manuscript from Mr. Cao Jusheng. After reading it for over a month, I found that his writing was not entirely refined. However, Haosou served as a secretary for Zhang Wenyi (Fu) for a long time. When generals consulted him during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi eras, his words were always well-founded. Moreover, he was versed in the Six Scripts of Shuowen Jiezi and cannot be regarded merely as a literatus. This manuscript was punctuated and annotated by Xu Ziling (Xishu) of Hefei, with numerous marginal notes and revisions, and several articles were deleted. At the beginning of the volume, Ziling inscribed: "Your esteemed collection is peaceful and elegant, demonstrating erudition and cultivation. The best passages are serene and simple, increasingly plain and wonderful. Regarding the selection and deletion of content, I hope you will understand! Summer of the Guiyou year of Tongzhi, inscribed by Ziling while relying on his luggage." His article "Proposal for the Temporary Establishment of a Governor of Southern Anhui" has a postscript by Xia Qi. Several pages of this manuscript are in Haosou's own handwriting. Yesterday, I saw another manuscript of Haosou's writings at Jusheng's place, which was hand-copied by his son Tongfu (Sizai) and also contains many poems, with a preface and postscript by Zhao Liewen. His poems were criticized severely by Liewen, who also advised him to delete several poems. The ancients' attitude of accepting good advice is evident here, and it is not just his literary talent and calligraphy that are admirable.

Haosou's given name was Yisun, and his courtesy name was Yichun. He was a native of Changshu. He was a Qing Dynasty licentiate and served as the prefect of Fengyang, known for his competence. At the age of twenty, he was fond of Deng Yuanbai's calligraphy. At that time, no one in Suzhou praised Wanbai's calligraphy. In the Bingwu year of Daoguang, Wanbai's son Shouzhi came to Changshu, and he gained a better understanding of his calligraphy and learned the rudiments of seal and clerical scripts. When he was an official in Xin'an, he acquired over eighty scrolls of Wanbai's calligraphy, covering all four scripts. During the Gengshen year of turmoil, he lost them all. Later, Zeng Wenzheng and others admired Wanbai's calligraphy, and its reputation increased, with a single scroll fetching a hundred taels of silver. Haosou once said, "Wanbai's calligraphy should be considered the best of this dynasty." Modern people all know to cherish Wanbai's calligraphy, and this really started with Haosou. Moreover, Haosou's small seal script, which made him famous, also owed much to Wanbai.

The collected works contain a great deal of historical material related to the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods of the Qing Dynasty, especially detailed accounts of the discord between Zeng Wenzheng and Zhang Wenyi, which will not be elaborated upon here.

### Snippets from America

— Cang Yu

In major American cities, cars are congested, and parking is extremely difficult to find. Bankers, with a twist of mind, have added "drive-in" savings departments. Customers can drive straight into the bank to withdraw money and choose a parking space in front of the many offices in the savings department to handle deposit and withdrawal procedures. Customers can sit in their cars without having to get out. Currently, there are over 250 banks nationwide that have opened this type of savings department.

The United States has an organization called the Tall People's Club. Men must be taller than six feet two inches and women must be taller than five feet ten inches to be eligible to join. The club holds two conventions each year. This year, it was held in Chicago, and 300 male and female members attended. As usual, telegrams were sent requesting that the berths on trains be lengthened and public telephone booths be raised to protect the interests of tall people. Mary Lorenga, who is six feet one and a half inches tall, was crowned and named "Tall Person Queen of 1948."

### Notes from Reading

— Ze Shi

Recently, after reading Harold Laski's "The American Presidency," I couldn't help but feel the difficulty of being a president, and I issued an order to my children: "From now on, you are not allowed to sing 'With a red face, you will become a great president' anymore."

It turns out that one of the difficulties of being an American president, according to Laski, is that the tasks are too numerous. Just the ceremonial duties alone are enough to exhaust him. For example, when a portrait of George V is sent from England, he has to attend the acceptance ceremony. When the National Education Conference opens, he has to make some formal remarks. On Washington's birthday, he has to give a speech, and on Lincoln's memorial day, he has to make a grand speech again. He has to give instructions to the Boy Scouts and welcome foreign princes and nobles. He has to review troops and visit major national projects. He has to travel frequently, otherwise people will say that he treats the capital, Washington, as the entire United States, and the travels must be carefully planned, because he has to pay attention to the political feedback. He has to give a speech in every place he visits. If he misses one, he will offend the local people and the congressman from that area, and they will inevitably find loopholes to take revenge. Moreover, all of this takes place under the watchful eyes of ruthless journalists, and any casual word or deed can become a topic of national conversation, and even his wife's behavior must be careful...

Laski's argument is very credible. I have also seen a story in another book about a president who shook hands with people all day and bled. But the ceremonial hardships are still manageable. What makes the American president mentally exhausted is that he cannot make decisions independently in political affairs and is constantly disrupted by the Senate and House of Representatives. Disruption is by no means an abuse of the word. The American political system absolutely separates executive and legislative powers. Members of the House of Representatives never forget that they are equal to the president and are most afraid that the parliament will become a rubber stamp for the president. Therefore, they argue vigorously against every presidential proposal, at least discounting it by 20% or 30%, and if things go badly, it will be "returned to the sender." And the president must initiate all bills. Regardless of whether it is for the benefit of the country and the people, for world peace, or for world war, he must first endure the criticism and investigation of the members of the House of Representatives, who are only responsible for criticism. It is a thankless task, truly the bitter fate of the American president!

However, although the history of the United States is short, it has never been "without a ruler for a day." Is this because human nature is good - willing to sacrifice oneself for the benefit of the country and the people? Or is it because human nature is evil - willing to risk death to eat pufferfish? This is truly worth thinking about in detail and exploring thoroughly.

### 

The change in the lives of the general public can be most conveniently referenced by the price of hiring labor. The high or low price demanded by rickshaw pullers is entirely based on the price of food. Before the currency reform, hiring three vehicles (or two vehicles) would start at "several tens of thousands." In the twenty-odd days after the currency reform, it started at "seven something" (meaning 300,000 legal tender as a unit), and now for slightly longer distances, it starts at "several yuan"! From this, it can be seen that the rate of soaring prices of other goods also has a tendency to rise in a straight line! (For example, from Zhengyang Gate to the back gate, hiring a rickshaw before the currency reform cost only 200,000 legal tender, but now it costs 1.5 to 2 yuan, and 5-6 million legal tender is still the price of two catties of mixed flour.)

With the opening of "price limits," all shops opened as usual, and the shelves were once again full of goods. Buyers enjoyed getting goods, and sellers had business to do, and they all showed vitality. It looked like a market. The failure of this currency reform has already been publicly acknowledged by the Weng Ge authorities, who have resigned several times. Major economic experts have made many famous remarks on this, mostly focusing only on the restrictive aspect and forgetting the whole picture. Pinning down the city, but not the countryside; pinning down legitimate businesses, but not the black market. It is like sawing a bowl. You have to consider all the parts and calculate how many saws and which parts to use before starting. If you rashly put effort into one or two places, then one pin and two pins will make the whole bowl even more broken and flawed.

Beijing has not yet experienced large-scale panic buying like Shanghai. However, "panic selling" occurs from time to time and is often heard. One type is selling woolen clothes, towels, and socks. At every market, temple fair, and busy street corner, there are often large piles and boxes of goods, with two or three people standing beside them, shouting loudly, sweating profusely (with a strong Tianjin accent), calling out that these are "goods from closed shops," "specially selling cheap," "sell them all, then they are gone," "buy them and sell them, all make money!" This attracts crowds, who rush to buy them. However, this "panic buying" is brought about by "panic selling." Their goods are always "goods from closed shops" (but who knows how many closed shops there are, throwing away their goods!), they are always shouting "sell them all, then they are gone," but they are never gone. The price is slightly cheaper than the shops and regular stalls, but with such a shout, it seems much cheaper. Another type is selling cigarettes, pushing carts or carrying baskets, with colorful slogans pasted on them, saying that these are newly released brands and that they are not afraid of costs for promotion, either buying two packs and getting one free, or buying one pack and getting a box of matches free. The types of cigarettes they choose are sometimes newly released products and sometimes unpopular goods, with reasonable prices and not very bad quality. Regular stalls also have them, but they are placed below various high-end cigarettes and are not noticed, and the prices are not consistent. These hawkers are good at seizing opportunities, gathering a large collection, and traveling around the city, preparing an empty wooden box or a large basket, specially for throwing banknotes in. The gold yuan coupons and customs gold certificates (legal tender), colorful, are piled and thrown around like a cornucopia, making the salarymen holding hundreds of yuan of gold coupons feel ashamed of their own insignificance.

In addition, some small merchants sell small furniture and daily necessities such as soap and magnets at any time, making the city look prosperous.
