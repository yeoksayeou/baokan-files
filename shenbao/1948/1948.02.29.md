[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The Legislative Yuan held its 347th meeting at 9:30 AM on the 28th, passing the "National General Budget for the First Half of the 37th Year," and decided to formally return the review report of the joint meeting of the Legal, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Economic, and Military Committees to the Executive Yuan after revising and supplementing it with new opinions raised at the meeting. Vice President Wu Tiecheng chaired the meeting. In addition to the general budget, the meeting also discussed and processed the "Regulations on Punishing Smuggling," which was passed with revisions as reviewed. The "Regulations on the Protection of Survey Markers of the Ministry of National Defense" were passed with revisions as reviewed. The "Organizational Regulations of the National Lanzhou Library" were passed with revisions.

The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM. The "Draft Law on Trade Unions of Public Enterprises" was postponed to the next meeting for discussion.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] The National General Budget for the first half of the 37th year, passed by the Legislative Yuan today, is divided into ordinary and special sections, totaling over 962.7 trillion national currency.

The ordinary expenditure section amounts to over 266 trillion yuan, with the following percentages: (1) National defense expenditure, approximately 39%; (2) Ordinary administrative expenditure, approximately 27%; (3) Education, science, and culture expenditure, approximately 13%; (4) Economic and transportation expenditure, approximately 2%; (5) Bond expenditure, approximately 14%; (6) Other, approximately 2% (decimal points for the above figures are not included).

Decision to Re-examine the Establishment of Special Criminal Courts

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] During the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 28th, when discussing the "Amendment to Article 8 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitorous Activities During the Period of Suppressing Rebellion and the Draft Regulations on the Organization of Special Criminal Courts," committee members spoke one after another, firmly opposing the independent establishment of special criminal courts, which would damage the complete judicial system at the beginning of constitutional governance by creating such a special institution. The case was first reported by Liu Kebei, Chairman of the Legal Committee, regarding the review process and the main points of the revision of the draft regulations on the organization of special criminal courts. He stated that the initial review opinion intended to attach special criminal courts to the high courts in necessary areas, but considering military judicial institutions, it was decided to maintain the principle of independent establishment. Subsequently, Lin Bin spoke, advocating for simultaneous review with the trial procedure law and urging attention to the fact that judicial power should be entirely under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Yuan after the implementation of the constitution. Sun Jiulu believed that the Legislative Yuan had made great efforts to abolish special criminal regulations during the War of Resistance, and this deformed system should not be revived. Since cases of treason are under the jurisdiction of ordinary courts, crimes of internal disorder are not more serious than crimes of foreign invasion, so why the need for special treatment? He also pointed out that suppressing rebellion is to quell chaos, and harsh penalties that disturb the people will only lead to more chaos. He advocated for the establishment of temporary special criminal courts attached to the high courts in necessary areas to handle bandit cases. Sheng Zhenwei cited British Prime Minister Attlee's view on China's implementation of new criminal law, saying, "The legal texts of many countries are beautifully written, but the most important thing is full implementation." He believed that the Special Criminal Court, jointly established by the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the Military Law Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, is neither fish nor fowl, destroying judicial unity. He advocated for passing the initial review opinion, and at least the personnel should be solely appointed by the judicial side. Liu Butong explained that the special criminal system originated in fascist Italy, violating the democratic trend, and advocated that the case be returned for review. Chen Ruxuan also opposed such regressive measures at the beginning of constitutional governance, especially the original draft's provision that the Ministry of Judicial Administration is the highest adjudicating body. Chen Haicheng also stated that the principle should be attachment to local high courts, and independent establishment should be possible when necessary, but it must be purely subordinate to the judicial system. At this point, Liu Keqiao further explained that according to the "Regulations on Punishing Acts Endangering the State During the Period of Suppressing Rebellion," the establishment of a Special Criminal Court should not be a problem, but its organization and trial procedures should be carefully studied by relevant agencies. He also agreed to return the case for review. Chairman Wu Tiecheng also believed that this matter is related to the overall health of the constitutional judiciary and should be carefully considered. Finally, the entire body unanimously passed that the case be returned for review, determined to maintain judicial independence and integrity.

### The Resident Committee of the Political Consultative Council Requests the Government to Strengthen the Defense of the Northeast

Then, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zuo Shunsheng was invited to report on the general situation of the work of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry over the past nine months. Subsequently, proposals were discussed, and the following cases were passed: (1) Wang Junying and others proposed a case to rescue the current educational crisis and broaden the avenues for youth survival. The resolution was passed and sent to the government for earnest attention. (2) Jin Weixi and others proposed that the quantity of rice and flour allocated free of charge to public servants and teachers should be appropriately increased to reduce procedural difficulties and restore family rice allocation to maintain livelihoods. The resolution was passed and recommended to the government for adoption and implementation. (3) Xue Mingjian and others proposed that the government improve the conscription system. The resolution was passed and sent to the government for earnest attention. (4) Yu Nanqiu and others proposed that the government improve the allocation of supplies and adjust the prices of public utilities. The resolution was passed and sent to the government for earnest attention. (5) Wang Huayi, Mo Dehui, Yu Bin, and others proposed that the government rapidly strengthen the defense of the Northeast. The resolution was passed and sent to the government for rapid handling.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Northeast representatives Wang Huayi, Mo Dehui, Yu Bin, and others submitted an important case concerning the Northeast war to the Resident Committee of the Political Consultative Council on the 28th: "Requesting the Government to Rapidly Strengthen the Defense of the Northeast." It was passed after discussion at the meeting and sent to the government for rapid handling. The rationale for the case stated that the defense of the Northeast is extremely important for world peace and the success of suppressing the rebellion, and it should be supported as much as possible. Furthermore, the current situation in the Northeast is extremely precarious and fleeting. The entire nation must raise its awareness, concentrate manpower and resources to gain time, boost morale, and reverse the military decline. The measures include: (1) Rapidly dispatching heavy troops for reinforcement; (2) Establishing local armed forces using effective methods; (3) Seriously promoting defection work; (4) Actively promoting the general mobilization to suppress the rebellion; (5) Expanding food airlift; (6) Rapidly restoring the traffic on the Yupan Railway; (7) Organizing and training refugees to prepare for returning home.

China's constructive food control is being implemented for the first time, and the government will strive to make this system a permanent way to conserve food sources.

### Traitor Zhou Fohai Dies in Prison from Illness

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 28th] Traitor Zhou Fohai died of illness at 2 PM on the 28th at the Capital Prison on Tiger Bridge in Nanjing. After being sentenced to death by the Capital High Court on November 7th, 36th year, Zhou tried in many ways to seek amnesty and had his sentence reduced to life imprisonment. Zhou then lived comfortably in cell No. 4, enjoying himself, and even planned to lead a group of traitors to organize a Peking opera troupe. Last September, his old heart disease recurred, soon turning into angina. On February 9th of this year, he contracted dry gangrene, which then spread to his liver and stomach, almost stopping his heartbeat. However, after Dr. Qi Shounan's best efforts, he survived until today. In the past six months, Zhou repeatedly sought bail for medical treatment, but the Ministry of Judicial Administration did not approve it. From the 28th, his condition suddenly worsened, and he sweated profusely all morning. By noon, he was unconscious. After treatment by the prison doctor was ineffective, he died just as external doctors and family members arrived at 3 PM. Zhou was from Xiangtan, Hunan, and was 51 years old. His son, Zhou Youhai, and daughter, Zhou Xihai, are both in Shanghai and are expected to arrive on the 29th. Zhou was dressed in a white cotton undershirt, and a pair of glasses were placed on the spring bed. His bones were as thin as firewood, and the arrogant face of the infamous traitor was no more.

### National General Budget for the First Half of the Year: Legislative Yuan Review Opinion Report

[Our Nanjing 28th Dispatch] The National General Budget案 for the first half of the 37th year, amounting to over 96 trillion yuan, has been approved in the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 28th. The full text of the review opinion report of the Yuan is recorded as follows:

"The administrative authorities have always submitted the budget to the Yuan for review around or after the start of the fiscal year.  Without sufficient time for detailed review, and without providing a final account within the statutory period for reference in reviewing the next year's budget, the Yuan has always felt that its budget review has been merely a formality, failing to fulfill its duty. This is something that all members of the Yuan should deeply reflect upon. The budget for the first half of the 37th year was also submitted to the Yuan for review nearly one month after the start of the fiscal year. Its content is based on the estimated numbers derived from the previous year's principal budget and supplementary budget of various agencies, which is clearly inconsistent with actual needs.  Just considering the revenue and expenditure figures listed in this budget, the expenditure listed in the budget for the first half of this year is enormous, and the deficit is significant. Considering the recent trend of rising prices and the results of budget implementation in recent years, the deficit in the future budget will be many times greater than what is listed today. If we rely solely on issuing currency or borrowing foreign debt to maintain it, the perilous future is simply unimaginable. After the Great War, our country continued with military operations to suppress bandits. The people are deeply impoverished, and financial resources are drying up. The administrative authorities have indeed made painstaking efforts to raise funds for national use, but being constrained by the environment and following old habits without fundamental reforms is an undeniable fact. The members of this Yuan deeply understand the current difficulties of the country. In addition to the opinions already put forward by the Resident Committee of the National Political Council, we now list the following examples of reforms and points of attention in various aspects of revenue and expenditure:

A: Regarding the revenue side:

(1) The surplus revenue listed by various national banks under the management of the Ministry of Finance and the China National Goods Bank, China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, China Industrial Bank, and Sze Ming Bank with government and private shares should all be appropriately increased after further consideration.

(2) For the revenue under the management of various customs authorities, some of the listed amounts are too small, and some are even several times less than the actual amount in the previous year. For example, in the general budget revenue and expenditure, the regular revenue section, item 11, "Income from Academic Interests of National Property," under the management of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Central Animal Husbandry Experiment Station, the promotion and breeding stations in the Hubei, Henan, Anhui area and East China area, the Tao River Basin and Qinling National Forest Area Administration, and the First Economic Forestry Farm, only list an income of 10,000 yuan for this year. The promotion and breeding stations in the West China area, North China area, Northwest China area, South China area, and Southwest China area only list 20,000 yuan each. The Tobacco Production Improvement Office only lists 30,000 yuan. Furthermore, the income of the promotion and breeding station in the Central China area under the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was 6 million yuan last year, but only 10,000 yuan is listed in this budget. The income of the Northwest Animal Disease Prevention Office was 100,000 yuan last year, but only 20,000 yuan is listed in this budget. The income of the Peiping Agricultural Experiment Station was 30 million yuan last year, but only 50,000 yuan is listed in this budget. Considering that prices have risen several times in the past year, the listed income is actually less than the income in the previous year. Also, the China Grain Industry Company, under the management of the Ministry of Food, only lists an income of 150,000 yuan. Given the large scale of this company, why is the income from property interests so low? All of these should be reviewed separately and appropriately increased after verification.

(3) Various tax revenues under the management of the Ministry of Finance, especially customs duties, commodity taxes, and direct taxes, should be thoroughly rectified, with every penny going to the public treasury to enrich the national coffers.

(4) To address the huge budget deficit, the government should promptly conduct property registration and take practical measures to ensure that those who have money contribute, in accordance with the principle of taxation based on ability to pay.

(5) The various processing agencies for surplus U.S. military materials and Lend-Lease materials, seized enemy and puppet property and materials, and Japanese reparations materials should be unified and merged to reduce waste and eliminate corruption, thereby increasing revenue. All sales prices should be appropriately increased after verification, and the responsible authorities should be strictly ordered to publicly announce the processing status on a regular basis.

B: Regarding the expenditure side:

(1) Agencies established without legislative procedures and redundant agencies should be reviewed and abolished by the Executive Yuan to save money.

(2) The tax authorities under the Ministry of Finance have complex structures. The (methods) for adjusting and simplifying them should be drafted according to the Yuan's previous year's procedures and submitted to the Yuan for review.

(3) The organization of the Ministry of National Defense is large and complex. It should be adjusted and simplified further according to the Yuan's recommendations from the previous year.

(4) According to the Constitution, education funding should not be less than 15 percent. The education funding listed in this budget is actually less than the amount in the previous year, so attention should be paid to finding ways to increase it. Furthermore, in the Ministry of Education's budgeted temporary expenses, item 10, training expenses, lists 140.8491 billion yuan for half a year, which is far greater than the 19.63706 billion yuan listed for the entire previous year. Attention should be paid to adjusting this.

C: Regarding other matters:

(1) According to the report of the administrative authorities, the increase in prices is far greater than the amount of currency issued. The issuance system should be made public and announced regularly to alleviate the public's psychological fears and help stabilize the currency value.

(2) The Executive Yuan should hire experts to thoroughly investigate the assets and actual business operations of various state-owned enterprises, calculate their profits and losses, and expose any concealment in order to rectify them and enrich the national treasury."

During the discussion, Chen Haicheng emphasized that the government should levy property taxes with the greatest determination. Chen Ruxuan pointed out that, as a result of inflation, this large budget is only two-thirds of the budget for the 25th year and is almost entirely used to support public officials. There is no economic policy, the performance of public industries is pitiful, and private manufacturers are too restricted, which is a completely suicidal policy. If this continues, it will be extremely difficult to complete the important tasks of the transitional government to suppress the rebellion and implement constitutional governance. Zhong Tianxin pointed out that foreign news reports that U.S. aid in various forms since the victory totaled $2.8 billion. Whether this is accurate and how it is used should be reviewed as a lesson for the future use of U.S. aid. Wei Tingsheng further lamented that due to policy errors since the victory, foreign exchange has been wasted and lost in various ways. He believes that self-reliance should start with the government re-establishing its credibility, and relying solely on foreign aid and loans is absolutely impossible to make up for the deficit. These opinions were also decided to be compiled and included in the opinion letter to request the attention of the administrative authorities.

### Assisting Our Country in Establishing an Air Force: More Than 1,000 U.S. Aircraft Sold to China: Washington Officials Reveal Secret Agreement

[United Press Washington 27th Dispatch] U.S. government officials revealed a very lengthy secret agreement on the 27th. According to the agreement, the United States is supplying China with 1,071 aircraft, including heavy bombers and fighter planes. They revealed that 936 aircraft have already been delivered to the Chinese National Government, and the remaining 135 aircraft have been designated to be delivered to China at a later date, including 37 B-17s, 42 P-47 Thunderbolt fighters, 53 P-51 Mustang fighters, and 3 C-47 transport aircraft. In addition, there is also air force equipment worth $178 million to be shipped to China, including spare parts. The cost of this batch of aircraft prepared for delivery to China is approximately $131 million, but the value sold to China is only $7.2 million. This secret plan will enable the Chinese government air force to have a heavy bomber squadron, a medium bomber squadron, four single-engine fighter squadrons, two airborne troop squadrons, and an aerial photography reconnaissance squadron. This agreement was proposed before the end of the Great War and was considered extremely secret by both countries. It was not to be announced until the United States guaranteed to assist China in maintaining and establishing an air force. According to the agreement, the Chinese air force is approximately equal to the strength of European countries such as Spain, Yugoslavia, or Turkey. The types of aircraft to be delivered to China are those used by the U.S. Air Force in World War II, but due to the development of super-bombers and jet aircraft, these types of aircraft are somewhat outdated. U.S. State Department officials revealed this secret plan in response to the demand of Republican lawmakers to strengthen military aid to China. Republican lawmakers in both houses of Congress criticized the State Department's proposed $570 million aid plan for China last week for including only economic aid. Secretary of State Marshall, while urging Congress to take swift action on the economic plan, carefully avoided committing the United States to fully support China's military, political, or economic aspects. He told a congressional committee on the 26th that U.S. military aid to China is already far greater than generally known. This statement clearly alludes to the secret air force agreement. According to this agreement, in addition to supplying aircraft, the United States is also responsible for training Chinese pilots and technicians in the United States and China. The plan includes training 1,546 flight pilots, 360 bombers, 192 navigators, and 3,034 technical personnel. The agreement expired on December 31 of last year, costing a total of $8.75 million. The delay in delivering aircraft to China after the expiration of the plan is partly due to the government's ban on arms shipments to China from the summer of 1946 to last summer.

It is also learned that U.S. Secretary of State Marshall and military officials do not attach great importance to the quantity of the Chinese air force. They all believe that what is most needed is the reorganization of the Chinese army. They point out that military transport aircraft are more important to China than other types of aircraft. Because the Communist army's night maneuvers cannot become the target of its strafing and bombing activities. This can only be effective in field battles.

### Kennan's Trip to the East and Japan Policy Eight

According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 26th: The U.S. government is currently re-evaluating its Far East policy, and Secretary of State Marshall has dispatched strategist George Kennan, chairman of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff, to Japan to investigate the country's actual situation. How will Kennan's itinerary unfold? What mission does he bear? Secretary Marshall has not revealed this, but the significance of Kennan's trip is self-evident. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 26th: A senior U.S. official commented on Kennan's trip to Tokyo, saying: Secretary of State Marshall's efforts to promote the "restoration of Japan" are due to his conclusion that the Chinese National Government can never be in a decisive position to resist communism in Asia; therefore, Kennan's trip to Japan is a prelude to the United States' intention to drastically change its Japan policy and build Japan into a fortress to prevent the Soviet Union from expanding its influence in the Far East. Although these are speculations from UPI diplomatic correspondents and may not be entirely credible, especially the UPI's claim that "the United States has decided to abandon its position of severely punishing Japan, which it held at the Potsdam Conference, and is trying to restore Japan's economic prosperity so that it can become a fortress to resist communism in Asia," is even more unbelievable. However, Kennan has already departed for Japan and will meet with MacArthur. It is beyond doubt that a major change in U.S. policy toward Japan will occur. Therefore, although we do not completely believe these messages, they cannot but cause us distant concerns.

Nearly two and a half years have passed since Japan's surrender. It cannot be said that MacArthur's policy of controlling Japan has achieved considerable success. However, the Allied Headquarters' treatment of Japan, whether in disarming Japan, lowering Japan's industrial level, or fundamentally eliminating its aggressive ideology, is inevitably too lenient and too tolerant. Especially MacArthur himself, not only does not doubt anything about Japan, but also absolutely believes in it. The editorials of this newspaper in the past year have repeatedly reminded MacArthur not to trust Japan too much; and repeatedly advised the U.S. government and public to be more vigilant toward Japan, as tolerance breeds evil. Under the circumstances a month ago, this aggressive train of Japan would soon start again. However, for two and a half years, the United Kingdom has been moving in this direction and has never changed. Naturally, it cannot but give the impression that the United States is supporting Japan's revival and anti-communism there. Therefore, Professor Hu Sheng, a political commentator with the most stable ideas, also had to say this: "In the minds of some people in Western democratic societies, the fundamental issue regarding the peace treaties with Germany and Japan today is no longer how to prevent the revival of Germany and Japan, but how to support and utilize these two wartime strong enemies to resist another victorious ally. Although this ideological and policy reversal has not yet been expressed in concrete plans or public documents, this trend can already be seen from all sides." Zhou's view was later refuted by Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, who bluntly pointed out: "I observe the responsible statements and actions of Western democratic countries and can make three judgments: (1) Western democratic countries have not abandoned the fundamental policy of preventing the revival of the aggressive forces of Germany and Japan; (2) because the two countries are fundamentally not allowed to rearm, Western countries will never support the two countries to resist the Soviet Union; (3) the so-called prevention of the revival of Germany and Japan should be interpreted as doing everything possible to prevent the revival of the armed and aggressive forces of these two countries." However, in the minds of the general public, the notion that the United States is supporting Japan to oppose the Soviet Union still remains. When Cabot, the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai, he made a speech to correct the general public's misunderstanding of the United States, and solemnly declared that the United States had no intention of supporting Japan to become an anti-communist fortress in Asia. We naturally deeply believe in the reasons listed by Cabot, but now that we see the news of Kennan's trip to Tokyo and the speculation that the United States will change its Japan policy, the anxiety and fear in our hearts rise again, making us have to say something to the U.S. government:

China's protest against Japan was the prelude to World War II, and China was the vanguard of the anti-aggression war. By the time the global war broke out, that is, after the war in the two continents of Europe and Asia merged, China signed the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference Declaration and became one of the four major powers in the world. At that time, all political and diplomatic teams with a global vision believed that after the downfall of the violent Japanese in the Far East, a stable force would be needed, and it would be the victorious China. Later, after the victory, the U.S. government and public also unanimously hoped that China would become a strong, unified, peaceful, and democratic country, and be the only stable force in the Far East. However, for two and a half years after the victory, because of the Chinese Communists' playing with weapons, not only was the country unable to achieve peace and unification, but also the national strength became increasingly weakened, which greatly disappointed friendly countries. Therefore, they changed their original attitude and wanted to support Japan. This view is not only extremely wrong, but also carries great danger. The current situation in China can be said to be a temporary phenomenon encouraged by the Chinese Communists' playing with weapons. Now the Chinese government and public are united in fighting the rebellion and suppressing the bandits. It should not be difficult to quell the war in the shortest possible time, establish a new, peaceful, and democratic China, and assume the special responsibility for peace in the Far East. Therefore, the United States' support for Japan not only ignores China's importance in the Far East, but also their vision is inevitably too short-sighted.

Even if people take a step back and assume that China is beyond redemption, the United States' policy of supporting Japan will not succeed. We don't have to state the reasons, but even Secretary Marshall himself knows this very well. When the U.S. Congress discussed the aid to China bill last week, Secretary Marshall also admitted that the deterioration of the war situation in Northeast China is sufficient to affect the U.S. position in Japan and Korea. In short, the United States either does not want to maintain peace in the Far East, or it has no other way to go except to help China revive and build the country and become a major stabilizing force in the Far East. If the United States wants to support Japan, it is tantamount to abandoning the broad road and insisting on taking a narrow path. The result will inevitably be self-defeating!

### Rehe Shuangtashan Iron Mine: Very Rich in Vanadium Content

Rare in the World and Deserves Continued Development

[Our Beiping 28th Dispatch] The iron produced in the Shuangtashan Iron Mine in Luanping, Rehe Province, contains a large amount of vanadium, making it a special iron ore that is rare in the world and deserves continued development. According to Wang Zhiyun, Speaker of the Rehe Provincial Assembly, vanadium and titanium are important raw materials for heavy industry. The manufacture of aircraft engines, gun barrels, and warship decks all require vanadium and titanium, and the worldwide production is extremely scarce. According to experts from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in the United States, there are only five places in the world, including Shuangtashan, Hungary, and Switzerland. After inspecting the mine, they were all extremely envious. Since the September 18th Incident, after Rehe was successively occupied, the Japanese fell in love with the mine at first sight. They started mining in August of the 30th year with a capital of 360 million yuan, producing 4,500 tons of iron powder per month. Among them, 50% was iron powder, 25/1000 was a mixture of steel essence and platinum, and 12% was raw material for electrical sources. There were more than 5,000 employees and technicians. However, since the victory, it has been suspended due to the war. Most of the machinery in the mine is still there, with little loss. Officials and civilians in Rehe Province all hope that the central government will restore it as soon as possible, and foreign investment may be introduced if necessary. It is reported that the relevant authorities here have planned to send personnel to investigate after receiving the report.

Several rice merchants, including Baoyuan, who were found to be raising rice prices, were arrested on the spot, and their responsible persons' account books were seized. They will be interrogated this morning. According to Chief He of the court, the rise in rice prices in Fuzhou is partly due to shortages, but also partly due to human manipulation. In the future, the court will take a judicial stance and resolutely carry out direct investigations to eradicate rice profiteers and maintain social stability.

### Death Sentence Approved for Jin Bihui

Execution Awaits Delivery of the Judgment

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 28th] The death sentence for international female spy Jin Bihui (Kawashima Yoshiko) has been approved by the Supreme Court. The judgment was delivered the night before last, and the execution of the traitor Jin is still pending. Recently, there have been rumors that the traitor Wang Yitang will be executed soon, which is a mistake referring to the traitor Jin. The Higher Court of Hebei Province today released the Supreme Court's judgment, the reasoning of which is largely the same as that of the Higher Court of Hebei, holding that the traitor Jin had premeditated for ten years to bring about the demise of her country. The crime of collusion with foreign enemies committed earlier and the crime of treason committed later are of the same nature and should be considered as one crime of conspiring with the enemy to plot resistance against the country. The evidence of the crime is obvious, and she cannot be spared death. There are rumors in Beiping that the execution will be carried out today, and some reporters have been waiting all day at the First Prison. However, according to court officials, the traitor Jin still has the opportunity to file for retrial or appeal, and even if executed, it is still pending. It is reported that Jin seemed quite surprised after receiving the judgment. Therefore, she reversed her previous indifferent attitude and felt fear, suffering from insomnia and loss of appetite, and is still trying to file for retrial.

### Joint Defense Command to Be Established on the Border of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu Provinces

[Our Xi'an Dispatch on the 28th] According to the most reliable sources, the remnants of bandits in northern Shaanxi have not given up their attempts to peek at Yan'an and Yulin, but it is estimated that they do not have much strength. Regarding the joint defense of Sichuan and Shaanxi, the authorities of this province believe that the matter is of utmost importance, because Shaanxi and Sichuan are not only adjacent to each other, but Shaanxi is also a shield for Sichuan. To seek stability in Sichuan, it must start from Shaanxi first. The reporter also learned that the joint defense headquarters to be set up in the near future will include a part of Gansu Province in addition to Sichuan and Shaanxi, covering 27 counties including Hanzhong, Baocheng, Wudu, and Bazhong. The relevant parties believe that the detailed organization and personnel selection have not yet reached the stage of formal announcement. In addition, the joint defense on the border between Shaanxi and Hubei has been implemented, with Laohekou as the core. It is heard that it is not planned to set up a separate new institution.

### Wang Yaowu Launches Relief Efforts for the Spring Famine in Shandong

[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 28th] Wang Yaowu, Chairman of Shandong Province, in view of the serious spring famine in the province, has specially issued three measures to launch a campaign to relieve the spring famine in the province.

### Foreign Minister Wang Reports at the Senate Standing Committee on Preventing Japan from Rearming; Prohibition of Restoring Military Institutions in Any Form

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 28th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a written report to the Senate Standing Committee on the 28th, providing a detailed report on preventing Japan from rearming, the Korean issue, and the Kowloon incident. The contents are recorded as follows:

A. Preventing Japan from Rearming

The plan to prevent Japan from rearming has been passed by the Far Eastern Commission on February 13. The content is as follows:

(1) Except for pistols and rifles and hunting rifles permitted by the Allied Headquarters for police use, Japanese people are prohibited from possessing weapons, ammunition, and war supplies.

(6) Naval vessels, machinery, and equipment of the United Nations that were obtained by Japan during the war should be preserved and returned to their original countries as soon as possible at locations designated by the Allied Headquarters.

(7) Japanese naval vessels that have been disarmed can be used to send back overseas Chinese or for other measures related to the implementation of surrender clauses.

(8) All military registration documents of demobilized army and navy officers, military police, and secret police should be confiscated and sent to the Allied Headquarters for destruction; Japanese people shall not compile or possess such documents in the future.

(9) Original Japanese military institutions such as the Army and Navy Ministry, the Marshal's Office, the General Headquarters, the Army Education General, the Navy Military Command, the Army General Staff Headquarters, other military and paramilitary organizations, and military schools and military science research institutions shall not be reestablished; the original Japanese demobilization institutions should be abolished immediately; newly established demobilization institutions should be civilian in nature and abolished immediately after the demobilization work is completed.

(10) All Japanese military and paramilitary organizations, including veterans' groups and clubs that promote militarism, should be disbanded immediately. Any form of revival or establishment should be prohibited; this provision also applies to any form of production control or cooperative society and other disguised military or paramilitary organizations with veterans as the core.

(11) Military training for the Japanese people and military courses in schools should be prohibited.

(12) Except for repatriation and demobilization agencies, Japanese government agencies, public utilities agencies, or educational organizations shall not employ senior military officers and responsible personnel of veterans' organizations, as well as other personnel whose employment would undermine the achievement of establishing peace and security; if such personnel have proven to have anti-aggression behavior in the past and have been approved for employment by the Allied Headquarters, this restriction does not apply.

(13) Implement all necessary measures to prevent the revival of the Japanese army, navy, military police, and secret police.

B. Korean Issue

Regarding the Korean issue, since the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution to establish the Korean Commission in November last year, we have sent Consul General Liu stationed in Seoul as our representative. Later, because the Soviet Union refused the commission to enter North Korea, the commission's member and secretary-general went to New York to request the United Nations Small General Assembly. Our government advocates that elections should still be held first in the election area (South Korea) to establish a government. This case has been supported by a majority of countries such as the United States and the Philippines and has been passed by the United Nations Small General Assembly.

C. Recent Developments in the Kowloon Incident

The Kowloon incident is still being discussed for a solution. We have sent Pan Hankui and Diao Zuqian to investigate the Shameen incident. We are now collecting and comparing their reports in detail as the basis for handling this case.

### Soviet Union Requests a Military Alliance; Finnish Government Submits to Parliament for Discussion; Preparing to Send Personnel to Moscow for Negotiations

[Associated Press Helsinki Dispatch on the 28th] It is now confirmed that President Paasikivi has asked all parties in Parliament to state their attitude toward Stalin's request for a mutual defense treaty before next Tuesday. The parties have now begun to discuss the negotiation process for Stalin's proposal. The Soviet note to Finland is expected to be included on the parliamentary agenda as a diplomatic issue around Monday.

[Reuters Helsinki Dispatch on the 28th] Finnish President Paasikivi and the Finnish cabinet met today to discuss the Soviet Union's note to the Finnish government on Thursday of this week, requesting Finland to conclude a treaty of mutual military assistance with the Soviet Union. According to a dispatch from Stockholm, political figures there believe that the Soviet Union's request for Finland to take all possible measures to conclude this treaty, regardless of the instructions issued to the Finnish Parliament, and the Finnish Constitution stipulate that the Finnish President or government shall not conclude military treaties with foreign countries without the full debate and authorization of the Parliament. Among the parties in the Finnish Parliament, only the People's Democratic League, which occupies 49 seats, one-fifth of all seats (i.e., the alliance between the Communists and the left-wing Social Democrats), supports concluding a military agreement with the Soviet Union. However, all other parties unanimously believe that in order to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union, it is necessary to accept the Soviet Union's request. Therefore, it is almost certain that the Parliament will approve the government to conclude a military mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union.

[Agence France-Presse Helsinki Dispatch on the 28th] The Soviet government sent a note to the Finnish government requesting the conclusion of a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance between the two countries. Well-informed sources believe that the Finnish government will certainly approve it, and a Finnish delegation will soon go to Moscow to begin negotiations.

[Reuters London Dispatch on the 27th] The London Observer believes that the Soviet Union's request for Finland to conclude a treaty of military mutual assistance with it is not only a diplomatic maneuver to conclude an alliance treaty but also part of its secret military plan. The Soviet Union has always regarded Finland as a fortress, and if it cannot be controlled by the Soviet Union, it will be a springboard for others to attack the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's request did not surprise people here, because the Finnish government delegation's visit to Moscow last November was a prelude to new developments between the Soviet Union and Finland, and the arrival of the new Soviet Ambassador to Finland, Lieutenant General Savonikov, last month further convinced people that a new stage in Soviet-Finnish relations after the war has begun. Although Finland is a country within the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, it has so far been able to enjoy the most free treatment from Moscow among its neighbors. The reason for this is that the Soviet Union does not want to be too shocking and drive the Scandinavian countries into the arms of Western countries.

### British Government's Policy Toward Czechoslovakia Is Being Thoroughly Reviewed; Czech Exiles Form Anti-Communist Central Committee

[Reuters London Dispatch on the 27th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the British government is conducting a comprehensive review of British policy toward Czechoslovakia. The spokesman also read to reporters a declaration of the Communist Party at the Second Communist International Congress in 1920, which stated that the fixed goal of communism is to destroy parliamentary government. The Communist Party's participation in parliament is not to engage in constructive tasks, but to destroy the parliamentary system of the bourgeoisie from within. The spokesman pointed out that the British government believes that this declaration is a very accurate analysis of the strategy taken by the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia.

[Central News Agency Frankfurt Dispatch on the 27th] Czech political exiles said that the Czech secret army has been mobilized to fight communism in the homeland.

### The World is Shrouded in Terror; France is Facing a Crisis; Bidault Urges National Unity

[Reuters Paris Dispatch on the 27th] French Foreign Minister Bidault reported on the Czech incident in the National Assembly, using it as an ominous signal after the Munich crisis. Communist deputies shouted and screamed when they heard this. When Bidault said, "France has become increasingly aware of the need for internal unity, and all those who prioritize national interests must unite," the entire audience except for the Communist deputies responded with enthusiastic applause.

The National Assembly held a foreign policy debate today. Bidault spoke first, saying, "The French government believes that the recent developments in the Czech Republic have immeasurable significance, run counter to the principles of peace, and contradict the promise to abolish autocracy in Europe. The development of the Czech Republic is one of many similar developments in a systematic way. The closer it is to France, the more dangerous it becomes. The Czech Republic is particularly sensitive geographically, politically, and morally. Historical facts have long fully demonstrated the importance of Prague's position. Not long ago, we still remember that Czechoslovakia was a dangerous signal to the whole world." At this point, Communist deputies shouted and screamed. Bidault paused briefly and continued loudly, "Now the sky over Bohemia is darkening again, and the hearts of peace-loving people are once again shrouded in terror. The drama being played now clearly has new characteristics. National independence has now become the target of attack, and the situation in the Czech Republic will change the international situation. The continuous implementation of these means will eventually lead to extremely dangerous developments.

### Emergence of a New Political Group in France

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] A new political group was formed here yesterday, conceived by left-wing socialists and the leader of the French existentialist school, Sartre. The group issued a declaration calling on democrats and the proletariat to unite and strive for the realization of the common program of the Republic. The party calls itself a revolutionary party, but also opposes the Stalinist line and social democracy. Its aim is to oppose capitalism, but also to oppose the "violence against violence" doctrine. The goal is internationalism, but it also opposes Stalinism and so-called "neo-fascism." Based on the above, some newspapers commented that this party is a "fantasy of technicians and intellectuals," and it is difficult to place this party on the political stage. Others say that the establishment of this party will split the Socialist Party, and the rift between the French Communist Party and the Gaullist faction will deepen further.

### Elections in Southern Korea Not to Sacrifice Korean Unification. Menon Broadcasts Guarantees to All of Korea

He said, "Even if they cannot attend for a time, seats in the National Assembly will remain vacant for them."

Menon expressed hope that the election "will begin no later than the first week of May." He said that the United Nations General Assembly has done its best to promote and accelerate the independence of Korea, and the remaining task depends on the political talents of the Korean leaders themselves. He said, "The final form of government must be decided by the Korean people themselves, and the Commission and the General Assembly will be happy to assist Korean leaders in promoting the unification and independence of Korea."

### Britain Sends Two Warships to Reinforce British Honduras

Guatemala Accuses Britain of Provocative Behavior

[United Press, Belize, 28th] Amidst rumors that Guatemala will invade British Honduras, British Royal Marines, fully armed, deployed on the western border on the 28th to defend this rich territory. The Royal Marines landed from the flagship "Sheffield" and paraded through Belize before heading west. Hundreds of citizens watched the parade. The general feeling among the onlookers was that Britain did not need to demonstrate its strength, and there were no signs of invasion. However, the British authorities said that the cruiser "Devonshire" may arrive here on the 28th, carrying the elite Gloucestershire Regiment from Jamaica, and its aid will permanently reside in Honduras. Britain and Guatemala have been fighting for Honduras for a hundred years, and this British demonstration has given local residents a sense of impending storm. However, Guatemalan officials denied all rumors, saying that they were spread by agitators from Mexico.

[United Press, Guatemala City, 27th] The Guatemalan Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed to Latin American countries, United Nations agencies, and the Pan American Union last night, continuing to investigate Britain's provocative armed behavior in British Honduras, and asked brother countries to implement solidarity and resist aggression.

### Soviet Suspicion Hinders US-Soviet Relations, Marshall Tells Senate Appropriations Committee

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] The Senate Appropriations Committee today released Secretary of State Marshall's statement to the committee reviewing US-Soviet relations. Marshall said that in normal peacetime relations with the Soviet Union, the Soviet government's response to our views is very slow, it is very difficult to consult with them, and they are very suspicious of our intentions. We encounter all kinds of difficulties because of Soviet suspicion. This suspicion is not entirely based on differences in ideology. There is almost nothing we say or do that cannot be suspected. The Soviet Union's suspicion is not false, but if suspicion can be eliminated, the relationship between the two countries will definitely improve a lot. However, even if suspicion is eliminated, our opinions on the evolution of the world will still not coincide with those of the Soviet Union.

### Hull's Memoirs (5)(3)

— North American Newspaper Alliance Copyright All Rights Reserved, Translated by This Newspaper's Translation Department

The Name "United Nations" Was Born From This

After the Pearl Harbor incident, I almost immediately began to consider how the various countries resisting Hitler and Japan should unite. By now, counting in the Latin American republics that are participating with us in resisting the Axis, there are nearly thirty countries resisting the Axis powers.

My first idea about the unity of the Allies was based on the Lima and Havana conferences on Western Hemisphere affairs. That is to say, when danger develops, united resistance must be organized. In my mind, I wanted to extend this policy to the whole world, because since the Montevideo Conference, I have often said that our Pan-American policy is applicable to the whole world.

I asked my colleagues to trace our relations with Latin America from 1938, review what the President had said about unity among the countries resisting the Axis, and examine the various steps taken after World War I, including unified command and military alliances.

So on Saturday, December 13, 1941, I asked Hamilton (Maxwell M. Hamilton), the director of the Far Eastern Affairs Department, to draft a declaration to be issued by the countries resisting the Axis, which would unite them until victory and should adhere to the basic principles we uphold. The next morning, Sunday, just one week after the Pearl Harbor incident, I met with my colleagues to discuss this declaration and another declaration on the establishment of a Supreme Military Council.

Hamilton drafted two drafts of this Allied declaration, pending adoption. The only difference between the two drafts is that one includes all the Allies, and the other separates the declaration into two. The first is signed by all the Allies except the Soviet Union because it is not at war with Japan, and the second is signed by the Soviet Union as well. We quickly decided to abandon the second draft because we believed that including the Soviet Union with the other Allied countries would be much more effective. After further exchange of views, I asked Assistant Secretary of State Welles, Economic Advisor Vance, and Hamilton to go to another room, include the proposed amendments in the draft, and bring it back to the meeting place. They did so and returned within half an hour.

We now agreed on the main points of what later became the United Nations Declaration. The preamble first reaffirmed the principles agreed upon by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill in the Atlantic Charter, and then stated that the countries resisting the Axis "are convinced that their complete victory in the world is necessary for the defense and preservation of life, liberty, and independence, as well as for the preservation of human freedom and justice, not only in their own countries but everywhere else. The struggle they are now engaged in is a common defense against the forces of barbarous tyranny, because these forces are attempting to conquer the world."

Below are the main points of the agreement, totaling three points. Each government must guarantee: First, "to employ its full resources against a government or governments that signed the German-Japanese-Italian Tripartite Pact on September 27, 1940, with which it is at war or may be at war, and to continue to exert its strength in this way until this government or these governments have been finally defeated."

Second, "to cooperate to the fullest extent in all respects with other countries, and to coordinate fully in military efforts and in the use of resources in resisting the common enemy or any one of them."

Third, "never to cease fighting against the common enemy or any one of them, or to sign a separate armistice agreement, unless it is done by mutual agreement."

Here, I feel that we are taking two major beneficial steps forward from the position we took during World War I. First, we are trying to unite all the countries fighting the Axis powers and accept certain principles that have already been stated in the Atlantic Charter. These are the right of all peoples to choose their own form of government; no expansion, no territorial changes opposed by the people concerned; trade and access to raw materials; improved labor standards, economic progress, and social security; international security; freedom of the seas; and disarmament.

When our government participated in World War I, it did not try to bind the Allies to any war goals. Various secret agreements had already been agreed upon by the Allied governments, according to which territorial changes could be made after winning the war. As a result, the Wilson government was severely criticized for failing to seek a common agreement on war goals among the Allies. The problems he encountered at the peace conference were greatly complicated because of the absence of such an agreement.

This time, I felt that the Allied countries should agree on certain principles in advance, leaving the detailed methods of boundary adjustments and other similar issues to be resolved later. If these principles can be firmly clarified and adhered to, then it will be easier to obtain solutions when resolving the details.

Of course, we must know whether there are any secret agreements existing among the Allied countries now. When we raised this question with them, they assured us that there were no such agreements.

Second, this time we are willing to fully connect with other countries resisting the Axis. During World War I, we considered ourselves and called ourselves "participating countries," not Allied countries. The declaration we are preparing now is of an alliance nature, which includes two main points of a general military alliance, namely, to guarantee full support and cooperation in carrying out the war against the common enemy, and to guarantee not to cease the war against the common enemy unless it is mutually agreed.

From December 15th to December 19th, my colleagues and I spent a considerable amount of time revising the draft of this document, which later became the United Nations Declaration. We also discussed another document to establish a Supreme Military Council, composed of heads or representatives of the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, China, and the Soviet Union.

Prime Minister Churchill came to Washington. In the following days, the President and the Prime Minister reviewed the contents of the proposed joint declaration and the proposal to establish a Supreme Military Council. Prime Minister Churchill or Ambassador Halifax notified London and asked the War Cabinet to express its views.

On December 27th, the President sent me his written comments on these two documents. Churchill had received the War Cabinet's recommendations on the Joint Declaration, and the President said he had taken them into consideration.

He said, "I think every effort should be made to include religious freedom in this document. I believe it is possible to lead (Soviet Ambassador) Litvinov to agree to this point."

He believed that the wording of the guarantee to continue the war against the Axis would be difficult for the Soviets to accept. This is because they are not at war with Japan. He suggested that the wording be changed slightly so that this guarantee applies to the Axis forces that are carrying out conquest, and with which the signatory country is at war.

The President said he was envisioning a way to make the point that the joint declaration and the Supreme Military Council are two different documents unnecessary.

He suggested that the list of countries presented in the opening section of the joint declaration should list all the countries at war with the Axis, including the Latin American republics. He said, "It seems clear to me that it is beneficial to include as many small countries as possible in the declaration."

The President believed that China and the Soviet Union should be taken out of the alphabetical arrangement and placed at the top of the list with the United States and the United Kingdom. He expressed the opinion that "I have a feeling that the Soviet Union would not be happy to have its name placed after some countries that actually contribute less."

He concluded: "I hope that the wording of the declaration should be given the most careful consideration, especially that part concerning the true purpose of our war, because it is to supplement the Atlantic Declaration.

As soon as you and Halifax are close on the Joint Declaration, I think you, Halifax, the Prime Minister, and I should hold a meeting quickly."

Subsequently, the President convened a meeting at the White House that night at six o'clock, attended by these four people.

During the meeting, the President and Mr. Churchill clearly had not yet reached an agreement on the establishment of the Supreme Military Council. Most of the discussion focused on this topic. So we agreed to adopt the new draft of the joint declaration as a single document, and the draft of the Supreme Military Council would be discussed further.

After the meeting, the President invited Soviet Ambassador Litvinov to come in, gave him a copy, and asked him to forward it to the government for comments immediately.

Two days later, Litvinov came to my office, bringing with him three amendments proposed by his government.

The President agreed to include the Soviet amendments. So I gave him a new draft, which he sent back to me on December 30, with a few words written on the edge:

"CH·OK· Now the Soviet Union and WSC (Churchill) have approved, China has not yet approved. FDR· Let it come out on January 1st. Means to be quick. FDR.

We immediately sent the United Nations Declaration to the governments on the list. At the President's request, I asked the governments concerned to respond immediately so that the document could be published on January 1st. I invited Chinese Ambassador Hu Shi to come in and personally gave him a copy so that he could forward it to the government.

The next day, December 31st, I sent the final form of the United Nations Declaration to the President, asking him and the Prime Minister to sign it themselves. I suggested that the President also invite Ambassador Litvinov and Song Ziwen, who had just been appointed as the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs, to come to the White House to sign it.

On the morning of December 31st, when Prime Minister Churchill was bathing at the White House, the President went to him and suggested that the United Nations Declaration should be named the "Declaration of the United Nations." The prominent bather agreed, and the name "United Nations" was born from this. The President re-copied our final draft at the White House, so this new name could be used.

On the first day of the New Year, Roosevelt, Churchill, Litvinov, and Song Ziwen signed this historic document.

### Crackdown on Drug Trafficking Organizations by Korean and Taiwanese Gangs; Police Bureau Completes Half-Month Investigation; Over 3,000 Taels of Drugs Seized; 32 Principals and Accomplices Arrested

[Our Newspaper] The Criminal Investigation Division of the Police Bureau recently cracked down on a major national drug trafficking case, seizing a total of over 7,000 taels of drugs and arresting 32 Korean and Taiwanese principals and accomplices, male and female. The case took half a month to investigate and was completed yesterday. It is scheduled to be transferred to the District Court for interrogation tomorrow. On the 7th of this month, Division Chief Li Junhou of the Investigation Division received a tip that Lin Huanming from Korea, Xie Jiangrong from Taiwan, and others had established a large-scale drug trafficking organization in Shanghai, which was heavily guarded. It used the name of an import and export trading company as a front. After consulting with Director Sun, he immediately dispatched section chief Feng Qishan, officer Qin Boliang, and other officers to conduct a secret investigation. It was not until 4:00 p.m. on the 15th that they learned that the organization would sell 200 taels of opium, with the contact address being Room 706 of the East Asia Hotel. As the market price at that time was 780 million yuan in legal tender, Director Yu was asked for and approved a portion of public funds to be used for the negotiation. After waiting for four hours at the meeting place, Lin Huanming, accompanied by Bai Bingxian, Zhang Juchu, Qin Beiru, and three others, arrived with a briefcase. After they verified that the legal tender was correct and were about to hand over the goods, the police officers who had been lying in ambush in the rooms on the left and right rushed in, immediately arrested the four, along with the drugs, and brought them back to the bureau for strict interrogation. They confessed that the headquarters was located in a building at No. 1286 Yangshupu Road, and a large number of police officers, accompanied by flying bastions (armored vehicles), were immediately dispatched to search the premises.

Drugs Hidden in Food Cans

At the scene, four Taiwanese individuals, Xie Jiangrong, Jian Zhixun, Jian KuanYu, and Lin Rongsheng, were arrested, and four cans of opium hidden in American food cans, weighing 183 taels and 9 qian, as well as 75 taels in paper packaging and 20 taels of morphine, were seized. Later, based on the confession of Lin Rongsheng, Wang Jinming, a Taiwanese national, was arrested at No. 4, Lane 49, Middle Xizang Road, and 96 taels and 6 qian of canned opium were seized. At this point, Division Chief Li determined that the case was not ordinary and immediately established an investigation team at night, assigning personnel from various sections to fully investigate. On the 17th, it was learned that Lin Huanming and Xie Jiangrong, among the arrested drug dealers, were actually well-known leaders of the Taiwanese and Korean gangs, and that the contact point for the Southern gang was located at Room 316 of the Jinmen (Golden Gate) Hotel, which was managed by Taiwanese national Li Zhuxing. They immediately went there without making a sound. In addition to Li himself, there was also a singer named Ji Jingliang. The two were taken to the bureau, and four letters in Japanese were seized from Li's person and belongings, addressed to the drug distribution points of the organization in Tianjin, Taiwan, Bengbu, and Nanjing. The general meaning of the letters was that the situation in Shanghai had been compromised and that communication should be stopped immediately. When Ji Jingliang was interrogated, she said that she only had a friendly relationship with Li and was unaware of the drug trafficking. Subsequently, Li Zhuxing's residence at No. 7, Lane 674, Tangshan Road was searched, and a secret mechanism for hiding drugs was found under the floor in the attic, seizing 293 taels and 5 qian of canned opium, 36 packets of morphine weighing 381 taels and 9 qian, and a large package of raw materials for manufacturing morphine. In the following days, dozens of perpetrators and suspects were successively arrested. On the 24th, new clues were obtained, and a member of the gang named Tang Shengxuan was arrested at No. 94, North Zhejiang Road, Tiantong Road, seizing 17 packets of morphine weighing 335 taels and 7 qian, 620 taels of coffee essence, and a box of raw materials and various tools for making red pills, 63 million yuan in cash from drug sales, 375 silver dollars, two 10-tael gold bars, two 1-tael gold bars, and gold rings and other items. The next day, another accomplice, Jiang Yulin, was arrested at No. 7, Lane 161, Fengyang Road, seizing 39 taels and 8 qian of morphine and 51 million yuan in cash.

Arrests of Perpetrators in Nanjing and Other Places

At this time, Section Chief Li, based on the letters seized from Li Zhuxing, dispatched officers Boliang and others to Wuxi, Nanjing, Bengbu, and other places to continue arresting relevant perpetrators. Zhang Jingjuan, the wife of Zhang Juchu, was arrested in Wuxi, and 15 taels and 7 qian of opium were seized. Xie Jiangkun, the brother of Xie Jiangrong, was arrested near the Confucius Temple in Nanjing, and 40 million yuan in cash from drug sales was seized. In Shanghai, the officials in charge continued to seize 69 million yuan in cash from drug sales at Xie Jiangrong's house and 41 million yuan in drug money at Wang Jinming's house. Another 7 million yuan was seized from the home of sales perpetrator Yang Yu. At this point, the case has come to an end, except for a few accomplices who are still being pursued by local medical authorities, and is scheduled to be transferred to the District Court for interrogation tomorrow.

Commendations for Officers Involved

The participating officers in this case include Criminal Division Chief Sun Yifang, Investigation Division Chief E Junhou, Section Chiefs Feng Qishan and Feng Xiushan, Officers Qin Boliang, Qian Daxin, Liu Zhaolong, Shao Guanrong, Lu Yixin, Zhang Jingyu, Guo Yuping, Chen Yingming, Ma Bingzhang, Zhang Jianyun, Guo Ruimin, Zhang Yunming, Gao Fuhai, Ding Wenjiang, Ding Zhaogan, Li Yiren, Li Bin, and Chen Xieshou, will be recommended by Director Yu to the authorities for commendation.

### On-Site Training for Recruits; Military Association Explains Reasons

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Military Service Association will propose at the military service conference to be held at the Municipal Council this morning that the central government approve on-site training for the 6,000 recruits enlisted this year in the city. It is generally expected that this proposal will be approved smoothly. The main reasons for this proposal are: (1) The city has military barracks, but new barracks would need to be built if they were trained elsewhere. (2) The quality of recruits in Shanghai is quite high, and they can be used if trained. (3) If the National Army stationed in Shanghai is transferred, the security force will not be reduced. (4) The city is a hub of land and water transportation, with convenient supplies and easy mobilization. (5) On-site training can reduce the recruits' fear. (6) It can serve as a model for new recruit training and facilitate the implementation of military service.

### Japanese War Criminal Zhongye Jiuyong, Who Escaped from Prison, Sentenced to Death for Trying to Evade Responsibility for Murderous Atrocities in Military Court

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhongye Jiuyong, the former Chief of the Special High Section of the Chongming Gendarmerie of the Japanese military, who escaped from prison for more than two months and was finally captured, was sentenced to death yesterday after being interrogated by the military court of this city. The main points of the judgment are: "Zhongye Jiuyong is sentenced to death for jointly and continuously massacring prisoners during the war."

At eight o'clock yesterday morning, the military court sent Adjutants Guo Xinfu and Chen Yaoqing, leading a squad of military police, to the police headquarters detention center to bring Zhongye to the Jiangwan Military Court. Zhongye requested to defecate and have a meal, and the military court sent someone to buy him five large pancakes to satisfy his hunger. At 10:30, he was first interrogated by the new warden of the war criminal prison, Sun Jiajun, and Deputy Warden Wang Chengcha. At 11:15, the president of the military court, Shi Meiyu, judges Ye Zaizeng and Zhang Tikun, prosecutor Wang Jiamui, interpreter Wang Renming, and clerk Song Dingya, took their seats. Zhongye Jiuyong, wearing a black and gray long gown and sneakers, with a full beard, gave a very cunning confession. The court first asked him about the motive and process of his escape from prison. Zhongye claimed that he had escaped on his own initiative and that the former warden had absolutely no involvement. The reason for his escape was that the case was "unrelated" to him, and he escaped to "avoid unnecessary sacrifice."

The Escape Process

After escaping from prison, he sold the suit he was originally wearing and bought the long gown he is now wearing on Jiujiang Road for 400,000 yuan. He spent the first night near the North Railway Station. On the 16th, he intended to go to Jiading, but he was inspected by the police at the city gate, who found that he had no identification card and suspected him of carrying heroin because he had two packets of aspirin powder. He was arrested and taken to the local police station, and then transferred to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters. He was detained in the detention center for eighteen days and interrogated once. When the judge asked him in Chinese if he was carrying heroin, he answered in Chinese. On January 5, he was transferred from the Garrison Headquarters to the local court and detained for more than twenty days. After testing, the two packets of medicinal powder were not found to be heroin, so he was released on the 2nd of this month and started pulling a rickshaw on Zha Pu Road Bridge. The day before his arrest, a merchant-like customer gave him 5,000 yuan for a rickshaw ride and asked him to return 3,000 yuan. He was unwilling to return the money because prices had risen, so they argued. He was arrested the next day.

Persistent Evasions

The presiding judge then asked him about the incident in Chongming when he tied Ji Xuego and nine others with rocks and threw them into the sea, and showed him photos of the skeletons taken at the seaside during the military court's on-site investigation. Zhongye even said that these corpses might be other drowned corpses from the sea that were washed ashore by the anchors of passing ships. The court also asked him that the residents of Chongming often saw him and Datin Zaozhi (already sentenced to death) escorting three to five or seven to eight Chinese people to the seaside at night, never to return. Where did these Chinese people go? Zhongye evasively said, "At that time, a large number of garrison troops often set out to suppress, but there should be no misunderstanding, that is a miscarriage of justice."

The court stated that the case had been tried several times before and the debate had concluded, so the prosecutor stood up and announced: "The case has been testified to by the family members of the victims, Huang Shangda, etc., and an investigation has been conducted with photographs taken, and the evidence is very conclusive. Although the defendant still denies it, there is no denying his guilt. As for the crime of escape, he will not be prosecuted in accordance with Article 233 of the Criminal Procedure Law." At this point, the presiding judge and others retired to deliberate. About five minutes later, they re-entered the court to pronounce the verdict. Zhongye looked nervous. After hearing the death sentence, he said, "Thank you for the fair judgment," with a hint of sarcasm in his tone.

Zhongye speaks very good Chinese with a Shanghai accent. When he saw people from the military court come to escort him at the police station, he knew that he could not escape and said, "I hope to die sooner." A reporter asked him what the purpose of his escape was. He said that he wanted to go to the Northeast to join the Communist Party. After the verdict was announced yesterday, the military court escorted him to Tilanqiao Prison for detention. The judgment will be reported to the Ministry of National Defense and submitted to the Chairman for approval before it can be executed.

### Prosecution of Six Defendants for Using Counterfeit Money

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Asheng and others were prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday for using counterfeit money. According to the indictment, the defendant Zhang Asheng received 50 million yuan in counterfeit money from his cousin Zhou Zhongda on the afternoon of January 30 of this year. He used 1 million yuan to repay the cloth payment to the Deda Cloth Store on Changshou Road. Xu Binnian, an employee of the store, noticed this and sent him to the Putuo Road Police Station for questioning. It was found that the counterfeit money was delivered by Zhou Zhongda. Zhou confessed that he bought it from Lu Huanrong. Lu confessed that he was selling it on behalf of his master, Fang Qiaoxun. Lu Huanrong had a brother-in-law, Ju Tongfa, who was very close to Lu and lived in the same place, but did not report the crime. Lu also deposited 6 million yuan in counterfeit money with Fang Qiaoxun's man, Xu Bao Huang. After the incident, Xu threw the counterfeit money into the garbage dump in an attempt to destroy the evidence. It was all found by the police. Except for Fang Ji Xun, who fled upon hearing the news, the rest were in custody. The defendants Zhang Asheng and Zhou Zhongda were charged with Article 196 of the Criminal Law. Lu Huanrong and Fang Qiaoxun were charged with Article 195 and Article 196 of the Criminal Law. Ju Tongfa was charged with Article 164 of the Criminal Law.

### Sichuan Province Strengthens Public Organization and Training Work

[Our Newspaper's Chongqing Telegraph Dispatch on the 26th] Since Xiao Yisu, Deputy Director of the Chongqing Headquarters, concurrently serves as the Chongqing Garrison Commander, he has a grand aspiration: the public organization and training in the fourteen counties under its jurisdiction, including Jiangbei, Ba County, Hechuan, Qijiang, Bishan, Tongliang, Yongchuan, Jiangjin, Rongchang, Dazu, Nanchuan, Changshou, Fuling, and Wulong, must be completed quickly. At the organization and training conference convened by the garrison headquarters, Director Zhu Shaoliang began by explaining: "If the public organization and training in each county is secured by the end of June this year, even if the Communist bandits intrude into Sichuan, it will not be difficult to annihilate them on the spot."

Do the Communist bandits actually have the ability to intrude into Sichuan? Zhu Shaoliang once declared in a

Firm Tone

at the conference: "The bandits in Northwest Hubei only have two columns, while the National Army defending the borders of Sichuan-Shaanxi and Sichuan-Hubei has doubled compared to last year. Based on the current troop strength outlook, the Communist bandits have no main force to intrude into Sichuan, but the bandits will definitely not give up their attempt to intrude into Sichuan for support."

Then, which route might the Communist bandits take to intrude into Sichuan? Our newspaper reporter speculates: (1) The 38th Column of Kong Congzhou's bandit troops, entrenched in Northwest Hubei, Zhengxi, attempts to cross the Shaanxi border, Baihe, and follow Xunyang, Ankang, and Ziyang to disturb Sichuan. According to military intelligence: traces of Kong's bandits have been found around Yangweisi, Baojiadian, and Jiaheguan in Baihe. Another group of more than 300 bandits has also intruded into Guanfangpu, Dongjiawan, and Zhuyuanhe near the border of Yunxi and Xunyang. (The above-mentioned places are all north of the Han River)

Kong's Bandit Movements

have been carefully planned. General Fang Jing, who is responsible for the defense of the Daba Mountains, is brave and good at fighting. He is an old cadre of the 18th Army, which was commanded by Chief Chen Cheng in his early years. Currently, the forward command post is located in Daxian.

(2) The main force of Luo Liufu's bandit troops is still in Maliangping. They once advanced west to Xiema River, but countless people died from the cold weather. Currently, they dare not advance west. In addition to preventing foreign bandit intrusions, the most important task of the Chongqing Headquarters at present is to eliminate the

Hidden Bandits in Sichuan Province

According to confirmed information obtained by our newspaper reporter: The bandit forces of Chen Taiyan, who rioted in Wuxi, Fengjie, and Yunyang in eastern Sichuan on January 8, and the bandit forces of Chen Yaojie, who recently disturbed Dazhu, Linshui, and Dianjiang, have been confirmed to have colluded with the bandits. Chen Taiyan's bandits openly marked their X branch, while the "political instructor" of Chen Yaojie's bandits was Xu Yongzhi, the Bao chief of the second Bao in Yangtong Township, Gujiang. It can be seen that the Communist bandit forces hidden in Sichuan Province have reached a point that cannot be underestimated. Therefore, the Chongqing jurisdiction's county-level public organization and training conference, which convened on the 20th and ended on the 21st, is of great significance.

The "Implementation Plan for Public Self-Defense Organization and Training" proposed by Xiao Yisu at the conference is a translation that

Baojia Personnel

must read at this stage. He repeatedly stated: If the counties under his jurisdiction implement it effectively, he will request the headquarters to forward it to the four provinces of Sichuan, Kang, Dian, and Qian for implementation. On the first day of the conference, he introduced the success of the Wanxi Civil Corps and the organizational situation of the Civil Corps in Western Liaoning, Shandong, and Shanxi. On the second day, Chen Hongmo, a former liaison officer of the National Army in Yan'an during the war who has been there for six years and is now the commander of the Ba County Garrison District, analyzed the Communist bandits' public organization and training. Finally, he adopted the

Personally Drafted

plan by Xiao Yisu. This plan, which consists of more than 18,000 words, is divided into ten chapters, including: (1) General Principles. (2) Organization. (A.

### Ningbo Coastal Fishermen Unable to Go to Sea for Fishing

[Our Newspaper's Ningbo Telegraph Dispatch on the 26th] The spring fishing season has arrived. Except for large pairs of boats that have already gone to sea, other large net boats will soon start fishing. Coastal fishermen, due to rising prices recently, have seen the cost of fishing gear and wages increase accordingly. One top of a fishing net requires 30 million yuan. Boat crews are paid in rice, and monthly wages for three months require about ten stones of rice per person. Each boat with five people needs fifty stones of rice, so the salary alone requires more than 100 million yuan. Adding in various fishing gear, the capital required is 450 million yuan. Government fishing loans and fishing bank loans are limited and cannot solve the problem. This year's spring fishing season, fishermen are unable to go to sea for fishing due to lack of funds, and a large number of fishing boats on the coast of Zhejiang Province will inevitably be reduced, and the lives of fishermen are very worrying.

[Our Newspaper's Wuxi Telegraph Dispatch on the 27th] Regarding the case of auditing and collecting business tax, the County Tax Collection Office suddenly sent personnel to inspect the account books of shops a few days ago, causing dissatisfaction and difficulties among the general merchants and people. Officials and merchants held each other, and the problem was not resolved. At this morning's general assembly of the County Council, there were four proposals on the case, which were merged and discussed and decided: (1) Tax collection through account inspection should be handled by the government in accordance with the actual situation of each industry, so as not to impose excessive burden, because the current tax rate is unreasonable. (2) Business tax is one of the county's finances, and the government should try its best to cooperate with the county's budget in its collection amount, and it is hoped that the number can be reduced to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. (3) The Legislative Yuan's Ministry of Finance should be telegraphed to amend the current business tax law, which is not practical. (4) Since the business tax has been approved by the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Conference and all of it has been listed as county-level tax revenue, the Executive Yuan should be telegraphed to issue a notice to implement it as soon as possible to avoid disputes. Also, whether half of the tax revenue for this year from January onwards still needs to be transferred to the province should be submitted to the Executive Yuan for instructions. (5) The work of sampling account books that is currently underway should be temporarily suspended by the county by letter.

The Preparatory Committee has held several meetings and believes that the scope of the exhibition has expanded to an international nature, and its purpose is not only to promote basic education but also to strengthen sincere cultural cooperation between countries through educational methods and promote the world citizenship movement based on basic education principles. All facilities are not being carried out carelessly, and it has been finally decided that the Basic Education Exhibition will officially open on October 10th, National Day. The entire school building of the Municipal Women's Normal School on Yuanyuan Road will be used as the venue. According to Chen Heqin, the general manager of the Preparatory Committee, the scope and far-reaching significance of this Basic Education Exhibition are unprecedented in the history of Chinese education. Therefore, all measures must be taken carefully. The specific exhibition methods are roughly divided into (1) static object exhibitions (walls, desktops, three-dimensional objects, real objects, models, charts, teaching materials, etc.) and (2) active educational performances (teaching demonstrations, children's activities, music and drama performances, adult activities, etc.). The exhibition hall is divided into five parts: (1) primary school education, (2) kindergarten education, (3) adult education, (4) special children's education, and frontier education, with special attention to basic education facilities in various countries, comparisons, and performances of some representative basic education special facilities.

### 社會局連日不斷拋售米價仍繼續上漲　白粳重叩三百大關秈米漲勢尤厲

After the rice price in the Nanshi Market fell back on the previous day, it was lower than that in the Beishi Market. The owners started to raise the price, and the asking price was generally higher. The morning market was the most popular, and the price outside the market once increased by more than 100,000 yuan. At the close, it was heard that the Beishi Market was weak, so it also softened. Bai Geng once again hit the 3 million yuan mark, Zhongdao was 2.95 million yuan, and Zaodao was 2.9 million yuan, each rising by 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Because the price in the Beishi Market was higher than that in the Nanshi Market on the previous day, the price fell back slightly. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau continued to sell Wuhu Xian, allocating it to 2,218 rice shops, distributing 13,655 shi, the same as the previous day. Also, yesterday, the price increase in the Nanshi Market was more severe for Xian rice. Wuhu Xian and Cao Xian each rose by more than 100,000 yuan.

Flour Rapidly Declines

The quotation in Wuxi fell sharply, and the Shanghai market was also affected. People's confidence was low, and the owners rushed to sell. At the opening, Hongfeng flour immediately fell to the limit of 1.292 million yuan, once as low as 1.28 million yuan below the limit. Although it still rose back to 1.3 million yuan, it finally retreated to the limit of 1.292 million yuan. Jiancheng flour also fell to the limit of 1.282 million yuan. Although Lao Che and Bingshan did not fall to the limit, they also fell slightly by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Bran fell sharply by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Only wheat remained at its original high price.

Edible Oil Fluctuates

Yesterday, people's confidence was still stable, but because the rice price rose, the owners took the opportunity to raise the price. Also, because it was Saturday, the street collected more goods, and sales were still active. Soybean oil was all in the form of return trading. Da You soybean oil opened at 6.25 million yuan, but the market was slightly weak later, at 6.2 million yuan. Other soybean oils such as Shunyu and Changde were all priced at 6.15 million yuan, each rising by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The market was weaker later. Sheng oil opened early, rising by 100,000 yuan. Qingdao Jitong Sheng oil opened at 7.1 million yuan, and Taian Jitong Sheng oil was priced at 7 million yuan. However, the market turned weak later, and it could not be sold. Shengcai oil and other oils rose slightly by 50,000 yuan. Jitong Xiaoche sesame oil stood at 7 million yuan. Soybean cake price was low and sales were active, rising by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains Vary

Because oil factories saw soybean cake rising, they rushed to collect yellow beans. Hankou Zha beans rose from 1.6 million yuan to 1.65 million yuan, an increase of 100,000 yuan. Other types of yellow beans rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Shengren supply and demand were equal. Qinhuangdao Shengren opened at 4 million yuan, rising slightly by 50,000 yuan. Jinbang sesame still had no intention of buying. The owners raised the price to sell, and the two sides held their ground. Finally, due to sluggish sales, it fell by 150,000 yuan to get rid of stale inventory. Jiujiang NaiDou opened at 2.8 million yuan, and there were not many transactions. The market for corn was unpredictable. It jumped wildly in the morning and then fell sharply yesterday. No guest helped with the purchase. Qidong corn opened at 1.95 million yuan, a decrease of 250,000 yuan compared to the previous market. Hongliang followed with a decrease of 50,000 to 100,000 yuan.

The main resolutions included ratifying the "Temporary Suspension of Yarn and Cloth Forwarding Measures to Stabilize Yarn and Cloth Price Increases" and the "Contract to Entrust Cotton Merchants to Purchase Cotton," and decided to expand the implementation area for the unified purchase of cotton from Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou to all regions where the committee has offices. It also strengthened the committee's control over raw cotton.

[Another report] China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 29,620 bolts of cloth and 110 bed sheets, with 859 purchase orders. Except for the 30 bolts purchased by manufacturers, the rest were purchased by various cloth shops.

The Yarn Market Was Initially Weak but Turned Strong at the Close

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was characterized by a large amount of supply due to the continued distribution of goods by the Textile Construction Company, resulting in abundant chips on the market. Moreover, due to the end of the month, many bulls closed their positions, and the market sentiment suddenly declined. However, the chips for 41s and 32s were relatively scarce, and the market sentiment was firm. Towards the close, practical manufacturers from both local and foreign areas took advantage of the low prices to replenish their stocks, and the market slightly improved. As a result, 42s Jianfeng fine yarn rose by 2 million yuan compared to the previous day, to 123 million yuan. In addition, most of the 40s intermediate grade continued to weaken. 21s Shuangma, both spot and warehouse receipts, rose by 500,000 yuan. 20s middle grade, only Jincheng was firm, and the rest weakened by 800,000 to 900,000 yuan to 2 million to 3 million yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market was characterized by general weakness in the morning, and due to the end of the month, the money supply was tight. Many industry players sold short, and retail investors also sold a lot, resulting in a decline in asking prices. However, at around 10:15, the northern gangs absorbed the low prices, and dye factories also came to purchase. As a result, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 2.7 million yuan, an increase of 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Also, Blue Chicken and Trumpet Boy fine cloth rose by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan due to factory searches. Private factory native cloth, colored cloth, and Shilin cloth, etc., were adjusted by the factory due to the 50% increase in the cost of living, and the market sentiment was firm.

Cotton Registration Deadline Today

The registration for the purchase of national cotton by the Shanghai Cotton Association on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee was originally scheduled to end yesterday, but there are still a few trading houses that have not registered with the association. The association decided to extend the deadline to 4:00 PM today, and will be open as usual on Sunday.

### 絲綢價均回降

The rayon market continued to decline yesterday. At the opening in the morning, 120s Xu Zi Youguang was as low as 44 million yuan, once reaching 7 million yuan, but the closing price fell to 6 million yuan for the selling price. In the afternoon, the sentiment was softer and the market continued to weaken, finally falling to 3 million yuan for the selling price. The factory market also showed a slight decline yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, the transaction price for C-grade was 65 million yuan. The payment terms were only two to three days, and there were several dan sold at 5 million and 4 million yuan higher than the zero-loss price. Because yesterday was Saturday, the transaction was very quiet. There were no transactions for other grades, and the asking price was also shortened accordingly.

The silk market was firm after declining yesterday. Huajiang Zhensi Beimian opened at around 7 million yuan, once hitting the 70 million yuan mark in the middle, but the closing price finally fell to 8.5 million yuan. Dacheng Gezi Chou opened at around 85,000 yuan, and the closing price was 90,000 yuan. Minsheng Jingfang Ni, the factory price was 380,000 yuan, and the street's purchasing was very active. The market for other goods was firm yesterday.

### 食糖續跌

The sugar market continued to soften yesterday due to the wait-and-see attitude of actual sales. The current price of No. 24 crude white sugar was lowered by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan by the association, the same decrease for No. 45 medium sand white, and 150,000 to 250,000 yuan for No. 20 medium sand white. Native sugar also loosened accordingly, with the cost of production already becoming inverted. Xinghua white sugar was priced at 3.5 million yuan, Xing Chi at 2.52 million to 450,000 yuan, and Diao Qing at 2.4 million yuan, a decrease of 400,000 yuan from the highest peak. Hainan Chi was 2.5 million to 450,000 yuan. The transaction of warehouse receipts was still not deserted, with the price decreasing by 150,000 yuan in the middle, but it still recovered later. As a result, the August contract rose by 50,000 yuan, and the September contract was similar. The Taiwan dollar was long by five yuan, at 142 yuan.

### 茶市內銷仍旺外銷茶欲漲無力

The tea market fluctuated on the original path from morning to close. Although sellers of various varieties intended to raise the price, they gradually reached a saturation point after rising for several days in a row, and there was a lack of stimulating news. Therefore, the process seemed to be unable to improve. As for transactions, export tea was still unwilling to move because exporters felt the price was too high. Internal sales, however, were still good in the street and the Suzhou-Wuxi area, so the buying interest had not subsided, and the transaction volume was not weak.

### 煤炭柴齊漲

Yesterday, the price of Yanbai coal in the fuel category continued to rise due to the lack of supply and the unusually active market, with stocks decreasing. The price of Jiaozuo lump coal rose to 12 million yuan per ton, Fengjie white coal to 10 million yuan, Pingxiang Yan coal also rose to 9.5 million yuan, Datong Yan coal to 10.6 million yuan, Chenxi Yan scrap to 8.3 million yuan, and Xuzhou washed coke rose by another 500,000 yuan to 8.5 million yuan per ton, an increase of 10% to 15% compared to the previous day.

Also, in the firewood and charcoal market, chestnut firewood and pine firewood were stable. Charcoal prices increased due to the increase in the cost of living and labor costs, and because residents were eager to buy, Qing charcoal rose sharply by 100,000 yuan per dan, to 680,000 yuan, white charcoal to 600,000 yuan, and black charcoal to 480,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 10%.

### 永紗存多斬售華股回風初展

Yesterday, the Chinese stocks were still in a clearing-out phase. Yong Yarn was sold off due to large inventories, and there was no beneficial buying to support it. It was getting worse and worse, and it was at its lowest point at the close. Only Lian Di rose to the limit. Guohuo was stable, and Jinglun also began to rebound after rising. It is difficult to have any prospects for development for the time being. The morning opened weakly due to the unease of industry insiders the day before. Yong Yarn debuted at prices of 1,050 yuan and 1,080 yuan, and then rose to high prices of 1,080 yuan and 1,095 yuan. The market price outside the venue still opened at the original price. The money supply was slightly tight, and it fell to 1,037 yuan and 1,065 yuan. Lian Di was listed as rising to the limit at No. 162, and Yong Yarn was advanced to 1,045 yuan and 1,080 yuan. There were still inspections outside the venue, and it fell again to 1,020 and 1,050 yuan. Although there was support at low prices, the afternoon closed at low prices of 1,018 yuan and 1,047 yuan. Only Guohuo was still stable. As a result, compared to the previous close, the spot share Lian Di rose to the limit, Guohuo Zhongsi was still stable, Liann Xinhua fell by 10%, Yong Yarn Meiya Xinhuo Xinguang Jingfu Qinxing Zhongfa Zhongni Yonggong Shangwu Tongyi Rongqi Zhabei fell by half a percent, and the rest had minor declines. The share of Yong Yarn Meiya Xinhuo and Jingfu fell by half a percent, and the rest had slight declines. The over-the-counter shares were slightly down.

### Imported Goods Tax Payment Delays Lead to New Late Payment Fees

[Our Report] Regarding the matter of merchants delaying payment of taxes on declared imported goods, and the implementation of a new method for collecting late payment fees, it has been approved by the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance and will be implemented on a trial basis for six months, effective immediately. The details of the method were announced yesterday by the Jianghai Customs as follows: (1) Customs import duties (including surcharges) and the commodity tax collected on behalf of the government must be paid within ten days from the date the Customs issues the tax payment certificate. (2) For overdue payments, a late payment fee equal to one percent of the import duty (including surcharges) and commodity tax shall be charged for each day of delay. (For delays exceeding thirty days, a late payment fee equal to two percent of the import duty (including surcharges) and commodity tax shall be charged for each day from the thirty-first day onwards, until the original tax is paid.) (3) The extension fee for extending the tax payment deadline, currently the responsibility of the import shipping agent, will continue to be collected according to regulations. However, for goods removed from the Customs warehouse that have not been taxed within fifteen days from the date the tax payment certificate is issued, the extension fee for extending the tax payment deadline will be levied. This extension fee will be abolished from the date of implementation of the late payment fee method. (4) For tax payment certificates issued before the announcement of the above method, the payment period shall be limited to ten days from the date of announcement of this method. Overdue payments will be subject to late payment fees.

### Government Bonds Continue to Rise, Foreign Stocks Turn Weak

Government bonds reached new highs yesterday due to the currency reform plan and the return of speculative funds to the stock market. The Unified C bond opened at 1,070,000 yuan, rose to 1,120,000 yuan, then began to fall back, retreating to 980,000 yuan, and finally remained above the 1,000,000 yuan mark. Room 503 sold off, while Rooms 552 and 555 bought. Compared to the previous close, Unified A and B bonds rose by 2,000 yuan, Unified C bonds rose by 3,000 yuan, Unified D bonds remained unchanged, and Unified E bonds rose by 1,000 yuan, with a total turnover of approximately 3,000,000 yuan.

The upward momentum of foreign stocks ended yesterday. With the easing of external stimulus, the market showed some weakness. There was little trading, and securities firms and retail investors were selling. Ewo Silk opened at 290,000 yuan and retreated from 1,200,000 yuan to close at 1,150,000 yuan. As a result, shipping and tramway stocks each fell by half a percent compared to the previous close, Hutchison Whampoa remained unchanged, and Ewo Silk, British American Tobacco, Guang Paper, and Baosteel saw slight declines.

Since the internal personnel adjustment of the Non-Quota Allocation Department of the Import and Export Management Committee, work efficiency has improved significantly. The current regulations for applying for appendices are quite practical, and the incidence of manufacturers making false declarations has been greatly reduced. Currently, the approval of applications for Appendix 3A (cameras, etc.) and Appendix 1 (production equipment) is fairly fair. Labor unions and associations are preparing to investigate the actual production equipment needs of various factories in Shanghai and the products that can be manufactured and supplied domestically for Appendix 1 items.

### Random Thoughts on Returning Home

— Xu Ren

I have lived in the city for more than ten years, and recently had the opportunity to go back to my hometown. I have never been particularly fond of Shanghai, disliking its congestion and annoyance, disliking its particularly numerous rumors. Once an accident occurs, it is always exaggerated several times and spread around. Some arguments are obviously completely unfounded, but everyone believes they are true, and special classes push the wave, sometimes even making the rumors become a reality. The environment of Shanghai is very suitable for these special classes, but it does not seem to be very suitable for those who are content with their lot. This is why I do not like Shanghai. However, although I do not like it, I have lived here for more than ten years, which is really unexpected. Therefore, when there was an opportunity to return home, I went happily.

I had not taken a train for many years, and had only heard people say how crowded and inconvenient trains were. So, I tried to arrange in advance to buy a ticket to Hangzhou. But when I got to the station to buy the ticket, I found that it was not as inconvenient as I had imagined; when I got on the train, I felt that the passengers were not as crowded as I had imagined. Perhaps this was due to the train schedule, or perhaps it was due to the season.

Since last year, the railway authorities have added reserved seating trains. Although the fares are more expensive than ordinary trains, the seats are more comfortable and the journey is faster. This method did not seem to exist before the war, so it is an improvement. However, there is one thing I do not quite understand: why do not other trains also adopt the reserved seating method? Of course, I also know that "reserved seating trains" are intended to be different from other trains, just as ordinary trains are divided into first, second, and third class. But the classes can be divided into first, second, and third class, just as trains can be divided into express, ordinary, and slow trains, and this does not prevent reserved seating on tickets. It is naturally difficult to provide all passengers with seats when transportation is a problem in our country. My method is: for all train seats, whether they are "tourist cars" or first, second, or third class cars, as long as there are still vacant seats, and they are not "full", the railway authorities should issue reserved seating tickets to all passengers. Only when there are no more vacant seats should ordinary non-reserved tickets be sold. This will definitely avoid the disadvantages of unnecessary scrambling, which is one benefit; secondly, this method can prevent passengers from traveling in higher classes than they have paid for. The biggest reason for scrambling to board the train is to grab a seat; once the reserved seating method is implemented, everyone will know in advance whether they have a seat or not; those who have not bought a reserved seating ticket will naturally know that they will not be able to occupy a seat, so there is no need to rush; those who know they have a seat will naturally not have to rush. Another problem on trains is that, according to the estimates of the ticket offices at the stations, there are obviously empty seats in the first or second class carriages, but because the second or third class passengers are too crowded, they see that there are empty seats in the first or second class, and the third class passengers crowd into the second or first class carriages, and the second class passengers naturally crowd into the first class carriages when they see that there are no empty seats. In this way, the passengers who bought first or second class tickets do not have seats. Strictly speaking, this is a violation of the law, but this situation is always due to the "scarcity of resources", so the words must be said so seriously. However, it is true that those who bought first or second class tickets should have been able to occupy a seat, but they have no seats due to other passengers traveling in a higher class than they have paid for, which is quite unreasonable. Adopting the reserved seating method can avoid this drawback. In terms of ticket prices, there is naturally no harm in differentiating between reserved and non-reserved seating. I remember that theaters in Shanghai did not adopt the reserved seating method in the early years; later, reserved seating was only available for more expensive seats; now, theaters all have reserved seating. This small matter of theater tickets shows the traces of gradual progress. The method of reserving all train seats will definitely be adopted in the future, this can be predicted, but there seems to be no reason why it cannot be implemented immediately, I wonder if the railway authorities are willing to consider it?

But after the train started, the scenery along the way was pleasant, and my heart was relaxed. I will not dwell on this. I will just say that I got off the train at Hangzhou City Station and changed to a bus of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to cross the Qiantang River Bridge. The Hangzhou Municipal Public Utilities Bureau bus has the opposite bank as its terminal. If you want to go to Shaoxing, you must transfer to a long-distance bus from Xiaoshan to Hui'e. Such a short distance - from the city station to the river, the journey takes about 45 minutes - is inconvenient for passengers getting on and off the bus. The long-distance bus of the Xiaohui section had already started before the war. The reason why the end point was at the riverside at that time was because the Qiantang River Bridge had not yet been completed. Now that the Qiantang River Bridge has been opened to traffic, why not change the terminal to Hangzhou City Station? The reason for this is probably that the Xiaohui section of the bus and the Hangzhou Municipal Public Utilities Bureau bus each have their own considerations. In fact, allowing the Xiaohui section bus to take the city station as the terminal would not have much adverse impact on the Hangzhou Municipal Public Utilities Bureau bus, because only passengers going to Ningbo and Shaoxing would squeeze onto the Xiaohui section long-distance bus. People whose destination is only at the riverside will naturally still take the Hangzhou Municipal Public Utilities Bureau bus. I think that for the convenience of passengers, it seems necessary to reform this segmented defect. Although this is a small matter in terms of travel, I firmly believe that social improvement is cumulative and is brought about by accumulating bit by bit; improving this small defect of segmentation is a bit by bit in a big improvement. At present, due to the ravages of war, our country's transportation has been fragmented enough, but that can be said to be unavoidable, but why should we divide it in cases where it is not necessary?

The Hangzhou Municipal Public Utilities Bureau bus to the riverside seems to pass Maojiabu on the shore of West Lake, I am not sure; you can also see a long embankment in the lake, I do not know if it is the Su Causeway or the Bai Causeway? You can also see a village on the shore of the lake, I do not know if it is Wang Village? In my opinion, the scenery of West Lake is most simple and pleasing in the corner of Maojiabu, but unfortunately the time is short, so I only caught a glimpse. This section of the road in Hangzhou seems to have another branch road leading to Wuyun Mountain, because I saw a road pavilion on the bus. I waited for the bus and sheltered from the rain in this road pavilion on my way to Wuyun fifteen years ago, and it is still intact. About five minutes after the bus passed the corner of West Lake, it arrived at the Qiantang River Bridge.

### Hanging

— He Ku

A relative who lives with someone as a tutor came to me this day and sent me two bottles of French perfume and two boxes of American-made tonics, which made me confused. This relative came to Shanghai originally to take the university entrance examination, but because the documents were not yet complete, he could not take the examination, so he took the next best thing and became a tutor in preparation for taking the examination in the autumn. Of course, the tuition of a tutor is enough to maintain his own life, but it is quite poor. If the food and lodging were not in the student's home, enjoying the privilege of "having wine and food, the teacher's meal", he might have to pay for it himself. However, I was very puzzled by the gift he sent, even if it was a gift for the New Year, there was no need for such a grand gift. I know that the market price of this kind of French perfume is more than 2 million yuan per bottle, and the cost of the two bottles of tonics is also more than a million gold. Could it be that my poor relative, in addition to tutoring, is also doing import and export business, and therefore the profits are huge, and he gives away such valuable things casually? My suspicion may be an excessive concern for this younger generation of relatives, and finally I opened the doubt in my heart with the following question:

Me: Have you been doing a side business besides tutoring recently?

Relative: No, I just read some books and prepare for the entrance exam when I'm not tutoring.

Me: (Looking at the gifts on the table) Then you're too wasteful, buying such valuable things -

Relative: (Interrupting me before I finished) These things are readily available.

Me: Readily available? Alas, you should put them away as hoarding goods, it's not easy to save money to buy something.

Relative: I don't have extra money to hoard goods.

Me: Then why are you so wasteful to buy perfume and tonics?

Relative: I don't need to hide anything in front of you, these were given by the family I tutor, and I don't use them myself, so I give them to you.

Me: Then this family you tutor is pretty generous.

Relative: It's true that they are generous. They usually buy countless odds and ends, including daily necessities, medicines, canned food, etc. The day before yesterday, they spent two and a half days trying to sort them out, but they still didn't finish. Some things, such as cigarettes and canned food, were already moldy, rusty, and inedible, so they were thrown away as garbage. Some cod liver oil had already deteriorated, so they were also thrown away casually. Therefore, the head of the family felt that in order to quickly clear out the old stock, it was necessary to give them away in large quantities, so as not to waste things. Not only did all the servants in the family receive gifts, but even the lowly tutor was benefited. Like this kind of perfume, the storeroom was filled with two layers of display windows, with all kinds of varieties. As for foreign tonics and Western medicine, they were even more full of boxes and chests. In fact, when the family's children are sick, they never take ready-made medicine, they always go to the pharmacy to get a prescription.

Me: (I didn't answer, which led my imagination to a fantastical realm...)

Relative: The head of the family said that these many things made him annoyed, and he would feel happy after clearing them out, otherwise he would not be able to buy anything to bring home in the future.

The conversation ended here. I think the annoyance that the head of the family said is worth pondering. Since he is annoyed by "having too much", it is better to be poor and happy. Whenever the cold current strikes, there are always dozens or hundreds of "frozen bodies on the road", no wonder the rich are annoyed by the stink of wine and meat. This kind of stink is the thing that the rich find the most annoying and troublesome. The world today is such a disparate picture.

### Where is the Other 40,000 Yuan?

— Jin Youyu

Seven friends went back to the hotel to drink, and when they were about to leave, they received a bill for 700,000 yuan, so each person gave the waiter 100,000 yuan. When the waiter went to the cashier to pay the bill, the cashier suddenly realized his mistake, only 600,000 yuan was enough, so he returned 100,000 yuan to the waiter. The waiter thought that it was difficult to divide 100,000 yuan among seven people without small bills. Anyway, they didn't know the correct amount, so he would give them each 10,000 yuan, and the remaining 30,000 yuan would be his extra income. So he gave each of them 10,000 yuan, so in reality each of them only paid 90,000 yuan. Let's calculate: seven times 90,000 is 630,000 yuan, plus the 30,000 yuan hidden in the waiter's pocket, totaling 660,000 yuan, and the seven people paid a total of 700,000 yuan, so where did the other 40,000 yuan go?

### The Human Heart is Like a Mirror

— Xu Jinjin

American New York magazines have a special column dedicated to collecting all kinds of "small news", adding annotations as appropriate. Those with obvious meaning are no longer annotated. For example, one issue contained a piece saying:

"Decatur Sex Crimes Now Held in Check"—See Decatur News headline

"Decatur Sex Crime Wave Not Yet Checked"—See Same-Day Decatur Free Press Headline

At first glance, it seems to create a sense of contradiction. On closer inspection, it may be due to different perspectives and viewpoints of the reporters. I often feel that the human heart is like a mirror, some are convex lenses, some are concave lenses, the light intensity is different, and the things reflected are naturally very different. I once heard Mr. Zhang and Mr. Zhao argue aimlessly about a film at a banquet.

Zhang: "In this film, the male lead is too old, not worthy of playing the role of a romantic young man, and the plot is simple and boring."

Zhao: "No, the song and dance scenes in the film are great, and the colors are gorgeous. It's worth seeing just for Bodil Hedegaard's dances and songs."

In fact, Zhang has his reasons, and Zhao has his reasons. Zhang likes to watch plot-driven movies, and Zhao likes to watch song and dance movies. The film itself may be good or bad, but mostly because the standards of the viewers are different.

In a special example, someone can't help but be happy when they see a fire truck passing by on the road, because they specialize in selling the remaining clothes for insurance companies, from which they get a commission.

Furthermore, the same thing elicits different images in the hearts of different people. People who are vegetarians and abstain from killing often buy cattle and sheep to release them, while Indians regard cows as sacred, and it is not uncommon for cows to swagger down the street while pedestrians avoid them on the side of the road. But to a foodie, the first thing they think of may be steak, or a bowl of well-seasoned spiced beef.

Also, everyone's views on colors are quite interesting. Young women like to wear red, while older people tend to wear dark colors. The late British writer G.K. Chesterton had no complaints about light blue in his essay "Talking About Shirts," saying it was the color of the sky. But he was very dissatisfied with red, calling it "the fading of roses and the reduction of fire," and saying that light red socialists cannot achieve great things, implying that he was criticizing fence-sitters and opportunists. Chesterton's richness of association seems to be evident here.

### Wandering Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Eleven Full of Doubts (83)

As for Feng Sheng, she thinks that she has no fate with me. As for Yun Qing, he still thinks that my divorce from Yuan Sheng was for her sake, and now she may be having a good dream. As for Aunt Wang's suspicion that I am with Yun Qing, which Qi Zhi saw and caused aversion, it is not unreasonable, but I have not been with Yun Qing recently. As for the family, no one knows about these things. Zhu Zhai thought about it back and forth and felt that what Aunt Wang said was not worth paying attention to. But why did Qi Zhi get close to Director Miao, and why did she change towards herself? This melancholy gourd really made people feel uncomfortable. Zhu Zhai used all kinds of speculation, but could not find a reason. In the end, he decided that when he saw Qi Zhi, he did not need to mention anything else, just persuade her not to get close to these military men. As long as she could realize it, or she could say why she was associating with the Miao surname, all the problems could be solved. Zhu Zhai held this idea and returned to the dormitory next door in the evening. He called several times to inquire, but Qi Zhi had not yet finished her record. The next day, he called again to inquire, but Qi Zhi still had not returned. This time, Zhu Zhai's mood was not as panicked as last time, but only increased jealousy, knowing that Qi Zhi was staying out all night, always restrained by the Miao surname. In this way, there will be many messy things in the future. With her stubborn personality, she cannot be disciplined, and she does not have the corresponding financial resources herself. In the future, everything will have to depend on her. If this is the case, will it not be far from the original intention of getting to know her that day! After these three days of work, Zhu Zhai was only loving and caring for Qi Zhi, fearing that something might happen to her, and then pitying her, it was really difficult to be understood. Therefore, after calling to inquire on the second day, he was no longer as enthusiastically concerned about her as before. On the third day and the fourth day, he called once in the morning. When he heard that Qi Wan had not returned, he no longer made the phone call. It was not until the fifth day that Zhu Zhai saw the news in the newspaper, which said, "A newly arrived important official, after arriving in Ping, became infatuated with a famous actor, and his reputation was tarnished. Recently, a foreign reporter revealed the matter to the authorities with pictures, and the authorities were greatly angered and decided to investigate and deal with the matter seriously. It is heard that the relevant authorities have received this order, and Director Miao was first given a major demerit and ordered to thoroughly investigate and report the matters he handled..." When Zhu Zhai saw this news, he felt that the three words "a famous actor" were very glaring.
