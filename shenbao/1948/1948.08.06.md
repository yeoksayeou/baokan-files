### Agreement Established Between China and the United States Through Exchange of Notes: Extensive Rural Reconstruction Work to Gradually Improve Economy, Education, and Health

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] Regarding the establishment of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, agreement has been reached by representatives from both China and the United States after consultations based on the U.S. Aid to China Act and the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement. The agreement was established today, the 5th, in Nanjing through an exchange of notes. The exchange ceremony took place at 11:00 AM today in the guest hall on the second floor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The ceremony was simple yet solemn. Ambassador Stuart represented the U.S. side, and Foreign Minister Wang of our country sat shoulder to shoulder with him at the long table they were accustomed to. After signing the incoming and outgoing notes respectively, they each delivered brief remarks, then shook hands warmly, and the ceremony concluded after exchanging and receiving the notes. After the ceremony, Foreign Minister Wang had a brief conversation with Ambassador Stuart and Mr. J. Lossing Buck, and appeared quite cheerful. Participants from the American side included Minister Clark of the embassy, Commercial Counselor Pauling, Agricultural Attach√© Dawson, and Mr. Joseph L. Buck, director of the Nanjing office of the China branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, among others. From the Chinese side were Hu Qingyu, Director of the Treaty Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Dong Lin, Director of the American Affairs Department; Deputy Director Chen Shicai; Shen Changhuan, Director of the Protocol Department; Liu Tingye, Chief of the Social Affairs Section; Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Intelligence Department; Deputy Director Zhou Shukai; Yan Jiagan, a member of the Executive Yuan's Committee on the Use of U.S. Aid; and many others.

[U.S. Information Service, Nanjing, 5th] Regarding the exchange of notes between China and the United States for the establishment of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, Ambassador Stuart issued the following statement today:

It is my earnest hope that students of Chinese social and economic problems will regard this day as a milestone in the trend toward sound improvement of conditions in rural China. Today, the notes exchanged between Dr. Wang Shijie and myself provide for the establishment of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction. The establishment of this commission is due to the recognition of the importance of rural improvement for all the people of China, and due to the recognition of an obvious fact, namely that the purpose of this reconstruction work should be to improve the economic, social, and cultural conditions of these areas. I have a deep interest in the work of the commission. I am convinced that news of the commission's establishment will be of great interest when heard in the United States. The terms of reference for the commission's work, as stipulated in the agreement included in today's exchange of notes, are quite broad, allowing the commission to engage in extremely important work in the area of rural reconstruction. One aspect of the commission's establishment that I am particularly pleased with is that it represents another chapter in the long-term close cooperation between China and the United States in this area. As for one of the most recent examples of Sino-American cooperation in this area, that would be the Sino-American Joint Agricultural Mission of 1946. To my knowledge, the materials and recommendations collected by the mission will largely be used as a basis for the commission's work.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 5th] Foreign Minister Wang made the following remarks at the signing ceremony for the exchange of notes on rural reconstruction held on the 5th:

The exchange of notes signed today is merely a supplement to the Sino-American bilateral agreement signed on July 3rd of this year. Chinese rural areas have suffered greatly from the long War of Resistance against Japan and the destruction by the Communist Party, and there is an urgent need for improvement. This rural reconstruction plan is agreed upon in response to this urgent need. This plan will allow Chinese rural areas to receive technical assistance from Chinese and American experts in rural economics, rural education, and rural health. After this plan is implemented, a large number of educated young people will surely join the work of rural improvement. Therefore, this plan is not only a rural work plan, but can also evolve into a rural leadership training plan. The funds allocated to this plan in the agreement are certainly not very large, but since the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction will utilize existing government and other institutions to implement its plans, all its funds can be used in the most economical way. I earnestly hope that the results produced by the funds used in this plan will be no less than the results obtained from using the same amount of funds in other ways. This is the best response we can give to the friendship of the American people.

Sketch Map of Northern Hubei and Southern Henan

[Our Correspondent in Hankou, 5th] Military News: It is confirmed that the National Army entered Xiangyang and Nanzhang at about 3:00 PM on the 5th. (Another dispatch) Military News: After a strong force of the National Army approached Nanzhang, they divided into two routes on the 4th to attack Xiangyang and Nanzhang, and the progress was very smooth.

### Railway Freight Rates Adjusted Today; Handled by Region According to the Business Situation of Each Railway; Appropriate Discounts Given for Third and Fourth Class Passenger Tickets

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 5th] Ministry of Transportation News: The Ministry of Transportation is studying the formula for adjusting railway freight rates in accordance with Article 5 of the Implementation Regulations of the General Budget for the Second Half of the Year passed by the Legislative Yuan: "The fees of state-run transportation enterprises, unless otherwise stipulated by law, may be appropriately increased with reference to costs, but the percentage of the increase shall be lower than the general price index, and the state treasury may provide subsidies if necessary, all of which must be approved by the Executive Yuan." However, before the formula is approved, the price of coal has recently skyrocketed. The purchase price of Kailuan coal in Shanghai in July was 32,984,000 yuan per ton, and it will rise to 81,500,000 yuan starting in August. In July, the salaries of employees were also greatly increased according to the regulations of the central government, and the losses of various railways are extremely large. The Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting has passed a temporary adjustment starting from the 6th of this month. However, this adjustment of freight rates is handled by region according to the business situation of each railway, and in order to reduce the burden on the people, appropriate discounts are given for the freight rates of daily necessities and third and fourth class passenger tickets. The adjustment method for each railway is based on the average pre-war base number of passengers and goods, multiplied by the following multiples: passenger tickets, a minimum of 500,000 times and a maximum of 1,000,000 times; freight, a minimum of 1,250,000 times and a maximum of 2,500,000 times. (Ticket prices for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways are published on page 4)

Editorial

### Regarding the Issue of Public Utilities Price Hikes

Since mid-July, the general price level in Shanghai has barely stabilized, and some prices have even started to decline. Ordinary citizens initially thought that the surge in prices might finally come to a halt, and were pleasantly surprised. However, those with foresight were already worried about how long this "short break" in price increases could last. As we expected, public utilities, which are most closely related to people's daily lives, suddenly announced new prices for August: water prices rose approximately threefold compared to the previous month, electricity prices rose by about one and a half to three times, gas prices rose by about one and a half to two and a half times, telephone prices rose by about one and a half to four times, and tram and bus fares also rose by about three times. The magnitude of these public utility price hikes is truly shocking! To put it plainly: for those with installed telephones, a single phone call costs 200,000 to 300,000 yuan; using a borrowed phone costs 500,000 yuan, and can even reach one million yuan. A ride on a tram or bus now costs at least 140,000 yuan, and longer distances cost 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. How can ordinary citizens survive this? This sudden surge in public utility prices will inevitably affect the prices of general goods and the cost of living for workers, and unfortunately, it may trigger a future "August price storm." While the municipal authorities may believe they have done their best, the general public naturally feels overwhelmed. The city councilors' request to convene a special session of the city council to discuss this major issue is, in fact, a necessary appeal on behalf of the citizens.

However, when discussing an issue, we must remain calm and objective. Especially those in charge should take a broad view and consider the overall situation. The current price hikes in public utilities, which affect the lives of every citizen, do not seem to be the responsibility of the municipal authorities. Everyone knows that public utilities are essential for people's daily lives. People's clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all related to public utilities. Every price increase is equivalent to increasing the burden on people's daily lives. Public utilities in all countries are regarded as services for the community and the public, and should not be compared with ordinary profit-making enterprises. Therefore, every price adjustment should consider whether the people can afford it. During the general meeting of the Shanghai City Council in February and March of this year, in order to stabilize society and prices, several resolutions were passed regarding public utilities. It was also suggested that a public utility investigation committee be established to investigate the revenue and expenditure and operating conditions of various companies, as a reference for whether to allow price increases. On the proactive side, it was suggested assisting the municipal government in finding ways to reduce the costs of public utilities, such as advocating for quarterly foreign exchange settlements or storage of oil and fuel required by public utilities, and requesting the central government to adopt subsidy policies when necessary. This call was made because whether or not these services raise prices can affect the whole situation. However, the central government repeatedly stated that the City Council did not have the authority to investigate public utilities, and ordered them not to interfere. The subsidy policy was insisted to not be restored. During this period, the foreign exchange system changed, and the market price of foreign exchange certificates fluctuated several times a month, even several times a week. Although the Central Bank has tried its best to provide assistance and lend huge sums of money, these piecemeal measures ultimately do not solve the problem. Moreover, the central government insisted that public utilities must be the first to implement the cost-based price adjustment system, regarding it as the "treasure" of "scientific price adjustment," as if other industries could be unscientific, while public utilities are exceptional. Under these circumstances, how can public utility prices not rise?

We absolutely do not want to defend the price increases of public utilities. It is true that some companies among the public utilities in this city may have excessive expenses, lax management, or unreasonable cost calculations, and there must be many areas that need improvement. Moreover, whether the new prices approved by the municipal government this time are reasonable is indeed still open to discussion. However, while the City Council is reviewing this issue, we cannot help but ask the citizens, the government, and various companies to face a realistic problem, and then jointly seek solutions.

What is the realistic problem? That is, what is the main reason for this price increase? We believe that the main reason for the large increase in public utility prices this time is the change in the government's foreign exchange policy. Before the end of May, the government used the exchange equalization fund rate for foreign exchange settlements. Since the beginning of June, foreign exchange certificates have been used. Therefore, the exchange rate for US dollars at the end of May was 474 (thousand yuan), but it rose to 2,474 (thousand yuan) at the end of June, and then jumped to 4,879 (thousand yuan) at the end of July. In other words, it increased by 4.24 times at the end of June compared to the end of May, and increased by 0.97 times at the end of July compared to the end of June, which is an increase of 10.3 times compared to the end of May. It is said that 40% of the fuel and materials required for public utility expenditures need foreign exchange, so it will undoubtedly be affected by this tenfold surge in foreign exchange in two months. The second reason is the increase in the cost of living index for employees. At the end of July, it was more than four times higher than at the end of May, which will inevitably affect 20% of public utility expenditures. If we compare these two increases with the increase in public utilities in the two months, then the discussion may be closer to the real problem.

However, in any case, if the central and local authorities only know how to raise the general foreign exchange rate, and are unwilling to provide remedial measures for public utilities that are related to all production industries, we can expect that this vicious cycle of rising prices will be difficult to contain. Not only will public utilities suffer, but the lives of the people will also become more and more difficult. Everyone should not underestimate the problem of public utility price increases. If we continue to ignore reality and let it run its course, it may lead to even greater consequences!

### High-Ranking Generals in Nanjing Did Not Hold a Meeting; Director Dong Responds to Reporter's Inquiries

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Director Dong Xian Guang responded to inquiries at a press conference on the 5th as follows:

(Question) What decisions were made at the meeting between the President and high-ranking generals? Was the assignment of tasks for the newly trained troops discussed and decided? Were there any changes in command during or as a result of the meeting?

(Answer) High-ranking generals did not hold a meeting. Currently, the Ministry of National Defense's military education conference is being held in Nanjing.

(Question) When will Neiji Okamura be tried? What kind of court will try him? What are the charges brought by the prosecutor? How was Okamura listed as a war criminal for investigation and prosecution? Whose order was this based on?

(Answer) Neiji Okamura will be tried by the War Criminals Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense. The date of his trial will be announced by the tribunal. The indictment issued by the military tribunal prosecutor on August 2 contains detailed explanations of Okamura's crimes and the process of investigation and prosecution. Okamura was listed as a war criminal by the Ministry of National Defense after the end of the war, and the military tribunal prosecutor was ordered to investigate and prosecute him.

(Question) The Communist bandits falsely accused the National Army of destroying river dikes. What is the truth?

(Answer) The Communist bandits falsely accused the National Army of destroying the Yellow River dike repair project, distorting the truth and confusing the public. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Water Resources has listed the facts to refute this. The National Army is gathered on the south bank of the Yellow River. If a breach were to occur, it would not only affect the safety of the people along the river, but also cause huge damage to the National Army. Therefore, the National Army not only did not destroy the dikes, but is currently protecting the construction of river dikes in the Gaozhuangji area.

### Zhejiang Province to Centrally Manage Pacification Funds for Various Counties

[Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 5th] The Zhejiang Provincial Government has recently decided to centrally manage the pacification funds for various counties.

All counties will use this standard. It is estimated that 1.1 million piculs of rice can be collected in the province, which can be used to support the newly formed provincial pacification troops, including nine independent battalions under the administrative district, and seventy-eight brigades and 250 companies in counties and cities, totaling 38,000 officers and soldiers. 900,000 piculs of grain are needed, leaving 200,000 piculs for repairing the Zhejiang anti-rebellion highway and fortifications.

### First Group of Pilgrims from Xinjiang Arrives in Shanghai via Xi'an

[Our newspaper, Xi'an, 5th] The Ministry of Social Affairs has allocated 30 billion yuan for the first phase of refugee relief in Shaanxi Province, which has now been allocated.

These measures are like a drop in the bucket, and the effect is minimal. It is reported that local civic groups have requested the authorities to allocate a second batch of relief funds as soon as possible.

[Our newspaper, Xiamen, 5th] The Dutch ship Tjisalengka arrived in Xiamen today from Makassar, Dutch East Indies, carrying 441 returning overseas Chinese. The Xiamen Customs had received a report in advance that the ship was carrying more than 200 rifles.

### Quartermaster General Headquarters Finance Department Announces Status of Military Expenditure Distribution; New Method for Salary Distribution to be Implemented After Approval

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] Since April of this year, the Finance Department of the Quartermaster General Headquarters has adjusted the cost-of-living index for civil and military personnel on a monthly basis. However, official salaries could not be paid in full at once, which led to inquiries from officers and soldiers from time to time. In order to make all officers and soldiers aware of the status of military expenditure distribution and the reasons for distributing salaries in installments, the department has issued the following statement regarding the status of military expenditure distribution:

1. The original regulation for the date of salary distribution to the National Army units was the end of each month, and the distribution had to be completed by the 5th of the following month at the latest. For the new system troops, the regulation was to distribute salaries twice a month, from the 15th to the 30th.

2. The military expenditures are requested by the Finance Department from the Ministry of Finance and transferred to the various supply units, and then transferred to the various troops. This requires complicated procedures and a long period of time. At the same time, because the Ministry of Finance must consider the funds prepared by the national treasury to meet the huge expenditures, the military expenditures have always been allocated in advance by the Ministry of Finance. At the same time, the payments cannot be made all at once, and are paid in installments.

3. After the treatment of officers and soldiers is adjusted monthly according to the cost-of-living index, the index standard must be approved and announced at the end of each month. The funds that the Ministry of Finance intends to issue also have to be allocated in installments based on the previous indices. Take the July expenses as an example. The first allocation was calculated based on the original index of 420,000 times for June (in fact, this batch was allocated in four installments). The second time, because the approved index for June was too low, an order was received to borrow half a month's salary, equivalent to an index of 210,000 times. The Ministry of Finance issued the payment order on July 19, and after sending it to the Ministry of Audit for approval, the Finance Department transferred the funds to the various supply agencies on July 19 for distribution. The third time, after the July cost-of-living index was determined to be 1.6 million times, in addition to the 630,000 times that had already been issued, another 980,000 times had to be paid. This index was decided at the temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan on July 31. The Executive Yuan's order was issued and reached the Ministry of Finance on August 2. The Finance Department received the payment order from the Ministry of Finance on August 3, sent it to the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank for deposit, and planned to transfer all the funds to the local supply agencies on August 5.

4. The Jiuguo Daily published on July 31 that the troops had only received 630,000 times the salary, and had not received 1.55 million times. In fact, the troops only received 630,000 times, because the Executive Yuan ordered that before the new index was determined, they could only borrow the old index of 630,000 times. As for the 1.6 million times the cost of the new index, we had to wait until the Ministry of Finance received the money on the 4th before we could deposit the money and issue it. The newspaper mistakenly reported 1.55 million times because the index had not been officially determined when it was published on July 31. At that time, the Ministry of Finance could not allocate the funds because it had not received the order, and the Finance Department could not request and transfer the funds.

5. This department has strived to distribute the salaries of officers and soldiers on time and quickly. Now, based on the Ministry of Finance's allocation period and the monthly cost-of-living index, we have formulated the following measures for the distribution of salaries to the troops: (1) Before August 10, a one-time loan will be issued based on the approved index for the previous two months (August according to June). (2) Before the end of this month, a one-time supplement will be issued based on the approved index for the previous month. (3) Before the 20th of the following month, the salary for this month will be issued based on the approved index for this month.

The above measures are a great improvement over the previous regulation of issuing salaries once a month at the end of each month. By the end of the current month, the index for the previous month can be supplemented and clearly issued, and by the 20th of the following month, the index for this month can be supplemented and reissued. If the upper and lower months are connected, officers and soldiers can receive the index they are entitled to every ten days without any delay. This is currently being reported by this department to the Ministry of National Defense for approval, and will be implemented after it is announced.

### Council of the United Relief Headquarters Approves Several Loan Proposals

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The United Relief Headquarters held its 369th council meeting on the morning of the 5th, chaired by Weng Wenhao. All council members attended. It was approved that postal remittances of family support funds by officers and soldiers of troops in the war zones should, in principle, be exempted from remittance fees to show preferential treatment. However, as the postal service incurs significant losses from these remittances, the Central Bank should provide convenience for allocation to subsidize these losses. Detailed measures will be proposed by the Secretariat in conjunction with the Central Bank and the Postal Remittance Bureau for approval. In addition, proposals for shipping loans, engineering loans for various railway bureaus, and loans for the transportation and sale of civilian grain in Taiyuan and Jinan were also approved.

### Ministry of National Defense Announces Weekly Battle Situation: Only Sporadic Contact Except for Taiyuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of National Defense recently announced the weekly battle situation from July 29th to August 4th as follows:

During this week of fighting, apart from the National Army in Taiyuan, which is still engaged in combat with the bandits due to launching counterattacks against the periphery, only sporadic contact occurred in other areas. Although the bandits have made movements in the Northeast and around Baoding and Jinan, their actual purpose is to cover the main force's recuperation and replenishment. They do not yet have the strength for large-scale reckless actions in the short term. Details of the situation are described below:

1.  North China Battlefield

Taiyuan Area: The National Army is gradually launching counterattacks against the bandits. Important strongholds on the periphery, such as Niejiashan (30 li west of Taiyuan), Nantun (20 li southwest of Taiyuan), and Xiaodianzhen (40 li south of Taiyuan), have all been recovered by the National Army one by one. The Baijiazhuang coal mine north of Niejiashan has recently resumed production, and the threat from the bandit army has been completely lifted. Our air force has been flying to Pingyao, Qixian, and Taigu for several days, launching fierce bombardments against the bandit army's headquarters and areas where looted materials are stockpiled, causing heavy losses to the bandits. The bandits attacking Bingyuan are facing supply difficulties, and their combat power has been greatly weakened. Under the fierce attacks of our coordinated land and air forces, the bandit army has shown signs of retreat.

Eastern Hebei Area: The bandits are frequently moving between Fengrun and Qian'an, and once made a probing raid on the Tangyu section. However, the National Army's deployment is strict. In addition to dispatching the air force to bomb the main force of the Nie bandits moving in the Zunhua, Yutian, and Qian'an triangle area, it also sent a large army to attack Fengrun, which was recaptured at noon on the 3rd. Currently, no new battles are occurring in the Eastern Hebei area.

Central Hebei Area: There have been no significant battles along the Pingbao line recently. However, parts of the 2nd and 3rd Columns of the Nie bandits, and the main force of the 6th and 7th Columns, are roaming around Baoding, claiming that they will attack Baoyuan. However, the National Army has made preparations. If the bandits recklessly attempt to succeed, they will inevitably suffer the same fate as the 8th and 11th Columns of the Eastern Hebei bandits, being severely defeated.

2. East China Battlefield

Central Shandong Area: The bandit forces around Jinan consist of the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 13th Bohai Columns, and the New 7th and New 11th Divisions. Although the bandits are deliberately feigning an imminent reckless action, they have not dared to rashly attack under the surveillance of our land and air forces.

Northern Anhui Area: The main forces of the Chen Yi bandit's 3rd, 4th, 8th, 11th, and Liangguang Rapid Columns are still wandering in the triangle area of Boxian, Taihe, and Guoyang. A week ago, due to pressure from the National Army in the Suxian and Yongcheng areas, part of the bandits fled to Zaoyang. The Fuyang garrison and militia, following orders to adapt to strategic needs and strike the bandits' military strength, cleared the area, protecting the people and safely moving to designated locations, and cooperated with the pursuing National Army to attack the bandits in Xugang. As for the scattered bandits on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, they have been completely driven back by our army. In addition, in the Northern Jiangsu area, the remnants of the Chen bandits' 2nd and 12th Columns once planned to sneak through the outskirts of Suining and move towards Lingbi and Suxian in Anhui Province. Later, when our large army of the Jinpu Railway launched an attack, the bandits fled back in panic towards the Yanghe (southeast of Suqian) direction, and part of them fled to the vicinity of Qianji (south of Shuyang) to cause disturbances. Currently, our large armies from the north and south are launching a pincer attack on the bandit forces. The remnants of the Chen bandits' 11th Column are recuperating and replenishing in the area south of Dongtai, with no significant activity recently. As for Feng and Pei counties, which were once occupied by the bandits, they have been successively recovered by our army.

3. Central China Battlefield

Northern Hubei Area: The purpose of our various National Army units is to strike the bandit army that retreated from the Xiangfan area, so they did not rush to recover Xiangyang City, but conducted a "capture battle" in the periphery of Xiangfan, searching for the main force of the Liu bandits. Currently, more than half of the bandits have fled to southwestern Henan, and the rest are scattered everywhere and will be severely attacked by our army. Nanzhang, southwest of Xiangyang, is currently being besieged by our army and will be recovered soon. Xiangyang City has long been under our army's control. As for the Central Plains Independent Brigade of bandits that disturbed Anlu in Central Hubei, it has been defeated by our army, and Anlu was also recaptured by our army on the 3rd.

Western Henan Area: A part of our powerful units penetrated deep into the suburbs of Luoyang for a surprise attack to scout the enemy's rear situation. As a result, the mission was accomplished, and the entire force returned, with many gains along the way. As for the local militia in Western Wan, they are brave and capable, with their heroic spirit undiminished. They are currently cooperating with the National Army to search and suppress the remaining bandits in areas such as Xixiakou, so that the western mountainous areas of the four counties in Western Wan can also be restored. Currently, our National Army on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway is continuously launching sweeping battles towards Wuyang Fuqiu, leaving the Liu bandits' 2nd, 3rd, and 6th Columns, etc., who are entrenched in the area, with no time to recuperate and replenish.

In addition, the National Army in Shaanxi has penetrated deep into the Huanglong Mountain area to search and suppress bandits, and the National Army in the Northeast is expanding its control over areas such as southern and western Liaoning. As there are no major battles, no further details will be given.

General Political Department of the Navy Announces Situation of Coastal and River Defenses in the Past Week

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The General Political Department of the Navy recently announced the situation of coastal and river defenses in the past week as follows: In the past week, in the river defense aspect, the bandit army assembly area at Longshaogang in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River was bombarded by our gunboats, killing at least 200 bandits. At the same time, it covered the army and local teams to capture the bandit army's position at Longshaogang. The remnant bandits were unable to resist and collapsed, fleeing to Tianxingqiao. An unknown number of bandits were immediately routed after being attacked by our ships. When the bandits retreated, they abducted seven local Baozhangs. Our motorized boat team cooperated with the army to attack the bandit army in the area west of Jianting and east of Taojialin in Northern Jiangsu from both wings. After several hours of fierce fighting, the bandit army was unable to resist and fled in disarray. Thirty bandits, 20 rifles, and 10 wooden boats were captured, 100 bandits were killed, and 50 bandits were wounded. After completing its mission, our motorized boat team turned to attack the bandit army at Hudu Jianyangzhen. The bandit army strongholds near the town were cleared one by one by our army, and there were no traces of bandits. In addition to arresting 10 bandit cadres, 20 wooden boats and some materials were seized. As for the coastal defense aspect, the bandit army's onshore positions in the Weihaiwei Qijiazhuang Zhudao and Shidao areas were continuously bombarded by our gunboats, completely destroying and burning them. Our ships patrolling the Jinshan Port area captured a sailboat outside the port, carrying 20 plainclothes soldiers of unknown units and many rifles, pistols, and grenades. Later, when the patrol ship was 20 li outside Liugong Island, a similar speedboat suddenly appeared, carrying 30 plainclothes soldiers. As their identities could not be verified, to prevent the bandits from taking the opportunity to harass, they were ordered to be arrested. In the areas of Bajiangkou and Shidao in Yantai, three bandit ships supplying materials to the bandit army have been captured, totaling 56 boxes of bandit materials, 14 sacks of hemp bags, and 100 barrels of diesel.

### British, American, and French Governments to Send Notes to the Soviet Union, Agreeing to Hold Four-Power Conference; Three Special Envoys Ordered to Meet Molotov Again to Determine Location, Date, and Agenda

[News from this newspaper] London, 5th (Broadcast): According to news from diplomatic circles in Paris, the French government has sent instructions regarding the Four-Power negotiations in Moscow to the French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Chataigneau. This news proves that the Western countries have decided to take the next diplomatic step regarding the Berlin issue. It is said that the French government's instructions indicate that the Western Three-Power envoys will hold new negotiations with Molotov, the content of which is related to the time, location, and agenda of the possible Four-Power conference.

[News from this newspaper] San Francisco, 5th (Broadcast): It is rumored that the British, American, and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union have received new instructions to continue negotiations with the Soviet side. The U.S. State Department neither confirms nor denies this.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 5th] Sources with access to information claim that the Western Three-Power special envoys may send notes to the Soviet government tonight, stating that the Three-Power governments agree to hold a Four-Power conference.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] Sources with access to information claim that British Foreign Secretary Bevin received a report from the British special envoy to Moscow, Roberts, this morning. This is his second report since arriving in Moscow. In the report, Roberts described the meeting he held yesterday with French Ambassador Chataigneau and U.S. Ambassador Smith. According to informed sources, the Three-Power representatives convened the meeting last night after receiving Bevin's telegram requesting the meeting. After receiving the report, Bevin immediately held discussions with the U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Douglas, and the French Ambassador to Britain, Massigli, this morning. It is heard that Bevin will send another telegram to Roberts tonight. Furthermore, the British Commander-in-Chief in Germany, Robertson, recently came to London to confer with Bevin and will return to Germany today.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 5th] The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, like the British Foreign Office and the U.S. State Department, is also strictly guarding the secrets of the Four-Power negotiations. In general, it is believed that unless the Western countries withdraw their agreement on the establishment of a West German government in Frankfurt from the London Conference, the Soviet Union will allow the lifting of the blockade of Berlin. American public opinion does not seem surprised by the possible change in the consistently firm policy. Officials at the French Foreign Ministry believe that the Soviet Union's desire for an agreement is no less than that of the Western countries, so the future is still optimistic. According to unofficial sources, Moscow and London may release some details of the conference within two days.

### New Currency Issued in East Germany; Soviet Union Agrees to Unfreeze It; Traffic Allowed Between Berlin and Leipzig

[News from this newspaper] New York, 5th (Broadcast): It is reported that the Soviet Union has agreed to unfreeze the currency issued by the Soviet side. It is said that the Berlin City Council and the German Economic Commission, supported by the Soviet Union, held a meeting on the afternoon of the 5th and reached an agreement. This agreement specifically stated that it was a "temporary measure." Financial figures in Britain and the United States warned against being too optimistic about this matter. Western countries fear that the Soviet Union feels it has made too many concessions, and as a result, will adopt a stronger attitude in future meetings.

[United Press, Berlin, 5th] The Berlin municipal government refused the Soviet Union's demand on the 5th. According to the Soviet Union's demand, the municipal government should announce that the Eastern Mark issued by the Soviet Union is the only legal currency for the municipal government and the entire economic livelihood of Berlin. If so, the economy of Berlin would be entirely under Soviet control. The Western occupying countries have agreed that 750,000 workers in the Western sector will be paid 75% of their wages in Soviet-issued Marks and 25% in Western-issued Marks. The reason the municipal government refused the Soviet Union's demand is that this matter would hand over the entire city of Berlin to the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities further used the freezing of the Soviet-system currency funds of the municipal government and Western industries and commerce as a means to achieve their demand to control Berlin's finances. As a result, the salaries for the second half of July for 750,000 workers could not be issued. Germans are asking the Western countries to supply as much Western currency as possible to counter the Soviet Union's actions. However, as the talks in Moscow are still continuing, it is difficult to take this direct action. In addition, it is believed that the Soviet Union's condition for lifting the Berlin blockade is economic control of Berlin, so the situation is even more complicated. The Soviet Union allowed trains from the Western sector to pass through to the Leipzig Exhibition on the 5th, raising doubts about whether the blockade is still effective. The Soviet-system "Berlin Daily" admitted that the Berlin-Helmstedt railway had been closed to Western traffic for 47 days due to "technical reasons", but it is still available. It also said that 43 special trains will be used to transport Western tourists to Leipzig. The American-system "Daily" reported that a railway spokesman said that special trains from the Western sector to Leipzig will pass through Helmstedt and enter the Soviet zone.

### Soviet Union's Blockade of Berlin Has Backfired

Food Shortages and Trade Stagnation in the Soviet Zone

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 4th] The result of the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin has affected the economy of the Soviet zone itself. The industries and commerce of the Soviet zone, which account for 30% of all of Germany, have been severely hit by the stagnation of inter-regional trade.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] The Berlin correspondent for The Times said today that serious food shortages have been reported in the Soviet zone of Germany. Several food riots have occurred there, and many rioters have been arrested. One of the reasons for the insufficient food storage is the result of collecting food to transport it to Berlin. The message also confirmed earlier external doubts about whether the Soviet Union has the ability to supply the entire city of Berlin with food. Riots have occurred in Chemnitz in Saxony and Rudolstadt in Thuringia. Furthermore, in the city of Westerode, people have crossed the Czech border in search of food.

### Truman Denies Saying Clay Will Be Removed

### United States Proposes Counter-Proposal on Danube River Navigation Management Issues, Advocating Establishment of International Organization Under United Nations

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 5th] U.S. Chief Representative Cannon today proposed a counter-proposal to the Danube River Treaty at the Danube River Conference being held here, to counter the Soviet Union's proposal.

[United Press, Belgrade, 5th] The United States today accused the Soviet Union of monopolizing the Danube River at the Danube River Conference, and suggested establishing an international authority under the United Nations.

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 4th] Soviet Representative Vyshinsky insisted on the principles of free navigation and respect for the sovereignty of Danube River countries at the Danube River Conference today. Yugoslav Representative Bebler and Czech Representative Clementis both supported him. Vyshinsky strongly stated that the Soviet Union's proposal can strengthen the economic and cultural unity between the countries of the Danube River. He strongly criticized the inappropriateness of Britain and France insisting on the 1921 Convention. He said, "Of the two committees established under the 1921 Convention, one is organized by non-Danube River countries, and the other is only attended by Romania. How can the sovereignty of Danube River countries be guaranteed? The Soviet Union maintains that the Danube River Committee can only be composed of all Danube River countries." Bebler also attacked the Western countries for taking advantage of the division of the Danube River countries themselves to occupy the Danube River. He announced full support for the Soviet Union's proposal. Clementis also supported the Soviet Union's proposal to end the control of the Danube River by non-Danube River countries.

### Britain and the United States Refute Yugoslav Accusations Regarding Trieste Port Issue

[Agence France-Presse, Success Lake, 4th] Ignoring the Cominform's condemnation of Tito, the Soviet Union seems to still support Yugoslavia's complaints against Britain and the United States regarding the administration of the Port of Trieste. Today, Ukrainian Representative Manuilsky at the Security Council supported Yugoslavia's position, believing that Yugoslavia has full rights to file complaints against Britain and the United States for violating international obligations at the Port of Trieste. U.S. Representative Jessup and British Representative Jebb strongly stated that Yugoslavia's accusations were unfounded, and pointed out that the Allied Military Government of the Port of Trieste has submitted reports to the Security Council on a regular basis, while Yugoslavia has never submitted reports on its mysterious administrative region. Yugoslav Representative Vilfan accused Britain and the United States of undermining the unity of the Port of Trieste, supporting elements that undermine the relationship between the British and American occupation zones and the Yugoslav occupation zone, and linking the economy of the British and American occupation zones to Italy. He said that ensuring the independence of the Port of Trieste is the responsibility of the Security Council. At this point, under the suggestion of French Representative Parodi, the Security Council adjourned the meeting to continue discussions next week.

### U.S. Congress Special Session Passes Adjournment Proposal

[United Press, Washington, 4th] Southern Democrats' five-day filibuster against the poll tax bill ended at 4:35 PM today. Before the end, the Republicans admitted defeat and agreed to abandon this politically explosive bill, and began to take action only on a small part of President Truman's anti-inflation plan. The removal of the poll tax issue from the Senate agenda was due to an adjournment vote, not a vote to adjourn today and reopen tomorrow. This move eliminates any proposals under discussion, so the poll tax issue is still in the process of being proposed to become legislation. The adjournment vote was 69 votes to 16 votes, and the efforts of government-sent Democratic congressmen were ineffective.

### American Newspaper Attacks Currie for Favoring the Chinese Communists

Currie Says Espionage Case is an Act of Aggression

[Central News Agency, New York, 5th] Currie, a former administrative assistant to U.S. President Roosevelt, who has recently been severely criticized in U.S. Congressional hearings for allegedly assisting Communist secret activities, issued a statement today stating that the accusations are "purely inaccurate acts of aggression and sarcasm." Currie said that he has not yet been summoned by the Commission on Un-American Activities, but he sincerely hopes to be summoned by the Commission "so that he can immediately deny the allegations." O'Donnell, publisher of the New York Daily News and its columnist, also attacked Currie's influence on wartime U.S. policy toward China, favoring the Chinese Communists, in his special edition discussing evidence of Communist espionage, saying that after Currie and Wallace went to China, White House leaders began to aid the Chinese Communists while being cold to Chairman Chiang. When Wallace went to China, he was accompanied by Lattimore, who was hired by Currie, and State Department official Vincent, who was later publicly accused of implementing America's leftist policy toward China.

### American Sunbathing Club Holds Nude Convention; All 400 Members Stark Naked

[Central News Agency, New York, 4th] People in the United States who believe in the "Return to Nature Movement" are holding their first national convention since 1939.

According to Dr. Boone, a 69-year-old pioneer of the American nudist movement and the association's public relations director, everyone's clothing must be reduced to the bare minimum.

### Looking to the Future of Berlin (Part Two)

‚Äî Translated by Zhang Yanshi

Berlin is currently divided into four occupied zones: Soviet, British, American, and French. At the end of the war, Berlin could still be considered unified. At that time, the Germans all worked under the direction of the representatives of the four-power military government. Now, the municipal government is split, and the reason for this is naturally the Soviet Union's refusal to recognize the Western powers' jurisdiction in Berlin.

The differences in opinion between the two sides have created the Berlin crisis. The Berlin events have greatly threatened public services in the Western powers' occupied areas. Because the Soviet Union holds a large number of underground tunnel facilities, the underground passages in the Western powers' occupied areas are in an abnormal state, because the Soviet Union cut off the electricity from the Soviet occupied area, which reduced the electricity in the Western powers' occupied area by 75%. The electricity currently used is only 25% of the normal level.

Most of Berlin's industries are concentrated in the Western sector, while most of the workers in the Western sector live in the Soviet occupied sector. The output of factories in this area, electrical equipment accounts for half of the country's total, and clothing accounts for 40% of the country's total. Now, due to the lack of raw materials, insufficient power supply, and inconvenient transportation, Berlin's industries are in a state of paralysis.

The food supply in Berlin used to be allocated to retailers by the Allied Commission, but now it has also been split. The Soviet occupied sector is supplied by the Soviet Union, and the Western occupied sector is supplied by Western countries. Because the Soviet Union does not supply fresh milk and fresh vegetables, and has cut off the Western countries' supply routes for food, coal, and other goods to Berlin, the food supply in Berlin has become a problem.

Transportation is undoubtedly the "key" to controlling Berlin. The Soviet authorities used this point to exercise their power to control Western land and water transportation to Berlin. Although the Soviet Union used a series of "reasons" to explain the cause of the "blockade," the people of Berlin understand that the purpose of the blockade is nothing more than the Soviet Union wanting to drive the Western powers out of Berlin.

If the Western sector of Berlin does not have Soviet supplies, then the area will need 6,000 tons of supplies from the outside every day, including 2,000 tons of food, 2,000 tons of coal, and 2,000 tons of other materials. As of June 1948, the food in warehouses and shops in West Berlin was estimated to be able to maintain the needs of three weeks.

Because land and water transportation are controlled, the Western powers have implemented large-scale airlift operations to meet the needs. However, 200 American C-54 transport aircraft can only transport a maximum of 2,000 tons of food and other materials per day. The Western powers plan to have 400 transport aircraft participate in this airlift organization, but it is expected that only a portion of these 400 aircraft will be large transport aircraft. Therefore, when severe winter comes, Berlin will need a large amount of coal and other materials, and even if the two airports in West Berlin are used for transportation, it may be difficult to maintain the balance of "supply and demand."

It is not impossible for the Soviet Union and the Western powers to reach a new agreement to govern Berlin in the near future. However, this agreement still offers very little hope for the Western powers' troops to remain in Berlin. Although both sides are currently trying to avoid war, there is no doubt that this Berlin event is "shortening" the distance to a third world war.

### Labor-Management Dispute at China Machinery Plant; No Results After Mediation

[Our Newspaper] Workers at the No. 1 Manufacturing Plant (formerly Toyota Plant) of the China Textile Machinery Manufacturing Company in this city, and the workers at the No. 1 Manufacturing Branch Plant (formerly Donghua Plant) of the same system, went on strike on the 3rd due to a dispute over treatment.

### Trams and Buses Raise Prices on the First Day; Passenger Volume Decreases on All Lines; Forced to Get Off the Bus; Transportation Company is Calculating Passengers Without Tickets

[Our Newspaper] The new bus and tram fares for August in this city were implemented yesterday. Due to the excessive increase in multiples, the citizens complained a lot, and some passengers did not know the new prices were so high beforehand. The fare they brought was not enough to buy a ticket, so many people were forced to get off the bus. Since yesterday afternoon, the passenger volume on each line has generally decreased, and it is expected that this situation will become more obvious today and tomorrow. In order to accurately calculate the ratio of passengers without tickets to the total transportation volume, the Public Utilities Bureau's Public Transportation Company has been using four types of free tickets since yesterday: "military," "police," "public," and "seasonal." All soldiers, police officers, public school staff, and monthly and seasonal ticket passengers who do not buy tickets will be given free tickets separately after boarding the bus. This method is intended to be used for a week to collect statistics. However, according to an expert who has studied public transportation, based on past experience, after a fare increase, there will inevitably be a period of reduction in ordinary passengers, and it will have no impact on passengers without tickets. Moreover, the multiple of this increase is very high. Before ordinary passengers get used to the high fares in the short term, there will be a significant decrease, and passengers without tickets will definitely remain the same. Therefore, if you want to count passengers without tickets during this period, the result will be an alarming percentage, and this percentage is not absolutely accurate.

### Special Broadcast; Father's Day the Day After Tomorrow; Fundraising for Tuition Assistance

On this Father's Day, everyone should be more self-conscious, celebrate the health of their fathers or cherish the kindness of their fathers. The most meaningful thing to do is to donate tuition assistance to help out-of-school youth. This newspaper sincerely hopes that thoughtful readers will generously donate in a timely manner, and can also set their own team names, arrange them in order, and publish them daily. As children, they will feel more meaningful.

It is also reported that Mr. Ying Yongyu, a reader, has been working at the Four Banks Savings Association for 20 years. On August 1, the bank was renamed the United Commercial Reserve Trust Bank, and Mr. Ying was promoted to the accounting section of the general management office. Friends and relatives of Mr. Ying sent congratulations. In order to express his gratitude, Mr. Ying specially spent 20 million yuan on banquets and sent it to this newspaper to subsidize tuition assistance, benefiting all relatives and friends.

### Reporting the Shipment of Flour; Suspicious Export Certificate Discovered; Customs Detains Goods; Urgent Telegram to the Ministry of Food for Investigation

At 2:00 PM on the 4th of this month, Ding Xingwu from the Yongfengli Customs Brokerage in this city, along with grain merchants Ge Chengqi (from Shandong, residing at Room 461, Garden Hotel, this city) and Wu Jianqi (from Shandong, residing at No. 15 Sijing Road, this city), went to the Jianghai Customs with two export approval certificates from the Ministry of Food to complete the export procedures for a large quantity of flour. When the anti-smuggling section was processing the procedures, it was found that the customs had not received a telegram from the Ministry of Coarse Grains notifying them of the certificates. When the certificate was inspected, it was discovered that the seal of the Ministry of Food printed on it was smaller than the original, and the handwriting was slightly different. Although the seal of the supervisor on the certificate was the same as the certificates previously issued, it was discovered that a character in the name on the seal was different from the original. It was immediately recognized as a forgery. The section dispatched port police to detain Ge and Ding for further interrogation. According to their statements, Ge Chengqi applied to the Qingdao Municipal Government for permission to import 40,000 bags of flour a month ago. The Qingdao Municipal Government approved the import permit for 12,000 bags. Wu Jianqi also applied to the Yantai Municipal Government at the same time for an import permit for 5,000 bags of flour. The two of them jointly entrusted a Sun Zhongyi to work on the export certificate from the Ministry of Food in Nanjing. Sun then entrusted a well-known Western doctor in Nanjing, Tao Youxin, to find a way. Tao then entrusted someone to work on two senior officials in the Ministry of Food's Control Department, and finally obtained this export certificate. As to whether it was a forgery, they did not know the truth. After the customs received the confession, they arrested Sun Zhongyi and sent an urgent telegram to the Ministry of Food yesterday to investigate the truth of the matter, whether it was a forgery or was indeed issued by the ministry. In addition, because the inside story of the case is complicated, it has been reported to the relevant authorities, and it is expected that the case will be clarified within days.

At around 2:50 PM on the 20th of last month, three customers suddenly came to the Huguang Fountain Pen Shop at No. 704 Hankou Road and selected 152 Parker fountain pens with gold caps, 34 with silver caps, 19 pairs of gold cap pens, 154 vacuum Parker pens, and 12 Waterman pens, totaling 24 billion yuan. The three customers helped with the packing at the time, but secretly switched the goods and declared that the disguised goods would be temporarily stored in the shop. They also asked someone to accompany them to the house of a relative named Jinghua New Village, Julu Road, to collect the money. The shop owner, Zhu Tingjie, went there in person. On the way, two of the three suddenly excused themselves and left. Then he went to the destination with the other person. The man said a few perfunctory words and left without saying goodbye. At this time, Zhu realized that he had been tricked and hurriedly returned to the store to check the goods in the package, only to find that they were all counterfeit goods, completely different from the originals. He immediately reported the matter to the Laozha Police Sub-Bureau for investigation. After receiving the report, Zhao Zhaoding, the chief of the sub-bureau, ordered Director Jiang to start the investigation. It was learned that the group of merchants who talked about the batch of goods were staying at Room 68, Anshang Hotel, Yunnan South Road. Director Song Shaomei led police officers Li Junkun and Ma Xishu to the hotel to search, but found nothing. That night, the case officers guarded at various wharves and stations, and also conducted various investigations, but found nothing. Two days later, a confidential report was suddenly received, saying that the group of criminals, together with the goods, had all fled to Hankou. Director Jiang immediately dispatched police chiefs Sun Zhiliang, Liu Zongjian, and Li Junkun to Hankou by plane to meet with the local police authorities. The male and female criminals Huang Fusheng, Xiao Yuan, Guan Ruiting, Huang Lian (female), Chen Sheng, He Lu, and Chen Zhen (female) were successively arrested at the Central Hotel on Minsheng Road and the Guanshengyuan on Jianghan Road. All the stolen goods were recovered. Yesterday, all the criminals were taken to Shanghai by plane and are now being interrogated. It is also learned that the Zhonghua Fountain Pen Factory at No. 517 Xujiahui Road was recently cheated out of 44 dozen No. 51 fountain pens of this factory, worth a great deal of money, and were also cheated by the same group of criminals using the same method.

### Thirteenth Route Bus: Two Drivers Beaten and Injured

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday at approximately 5:00 PM, a Route 13 bus was traveling from Fenglin Bridge towards the South Wharf. While passing the intersection of Xieqiao and Lujiabang Road, suddenly, over two hundred workers from the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy Department, who had been lying in wait, arrived in ten trucks, including military trucks numbered 88044 and 88045. Spotting the bus, they rushed forward and stopped it. The driver of bus number 566, Zhou Jinsheng, and another driver, Li Jinpeng, number 963, were dragged off and brutally beaten. Some of the workers were armed with iron bars and other weapons. After the two drivers were beaten and fell to the ground, the workers boarded the trucks and fled in different directions. The two injured drivers were later taken to the hospital for treatment. According to Zhao Fuqi, a ticket inspector from the Route 20 bus company, who testified at the Penglai Police Station, the workers' attack was likely due to previous disputes over fares during bus rides.

### Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters: Opinions on Reforming Party Affairs

In response to the central government's movement to reform party affairs, the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang recently convened several meetings of executive and supervisory committee members, as well as cadres from various district party branches. They have now compiled a written opinion summarizing the various viewpoints, which was submitted to the President and the Central Executive Committee yesterday for consideration. The main points are outlined below: (1) To thoroughly reform party affairs, it is essential to solicit the opinions of the party's extensive grassroots cadres. Therefore, a national representative assembly should be convened, as a small number of senior central cadres are insufficient to bear this responsibility. (2) To revitalize the party's revolutionary spirit, the party should be renamed the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Party, and its political program and policies should be revised. (3) The number of Central Standing Committee members should be limited to a maximum of thirty, elected by the national representative assembly, and a rotating five-member monthly duty system should be established to assist the President in handling party affairs. (4) The center of activity for provincial (municipal) party affairs should be shifted to the county (district) party branches. (5) Party discipline should be strictly enforced, and party members in government should be managed. Anyone found organizing factions within the party should have their initiators identified, expelled from the party, and their organizations dissolved. (6) Firmly pursue the revolutionary tasks of the current stage: completing the suppression of the rebellion, implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood, and establishing a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People.

### Afflicted by Illness and Misfortune: Ding Guitang's Son Dies

[Report from Our Newspaper, Kuling, 5th] Qu, the daughter-in-law of Ding Guitang, who unsuccessfully attempted suicide by jumping from a building in Kuling, previously went to Jiujiang for treatment. However, as Jiujiang lacked orthopedic specialists, she transferred to Nanchang. At that time, Ding Guitang's son, Chen, who had been staying on the mountain, also descended to Nanchang to visit her. It has now been learned that Qu's illness has not yet healed, while Ding's son, due to the fatigue of traveling up and down the mountain, suffered a worsening of his condition and passed away in his lodgings in Nanchang.

### Shareholders of Guangzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory Accuse Chairman and Others of Embezzlement

Jin Songcheng, chairman of the Guangzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory; Qu Wansheng, the current general manager; and Zhang Diesheng, the former general manager, have recently been sued in court by shareholders Dan Hengjin, Dan Lingyi, Dan Qiuhong, and three others, who accuse them of embezzling equity. According to the plaintiffs, after the outbreak of the August 13th Resistance, they were all in the rear areas, but Guangzhong's business flourished. The defendants, however, used the pretext of increasing capital to deprive the shareholders of their rights and seize company assets. During the occupation period, they also colluded with the Japanese to seize the company's equipment and the shareholders' rights. The defendant Zhang Diesheng has already been indicted by the High Procuratorate on charges of treason, and Zhang has fled to evade punishment. The Guangzhong Factory then appointed Qu Wansheng as the successor manager, who sold the factory's machinery and cloth to newly formed companies such as Xinzhong, Lianzhong, Xingzhong, Hezhong, and Fuzhong, which were established by the defendants themselves, at a price of one-tenth of their value, and embezzled the profits that should have been earned by the company. The case was publicly heard yesterday by Judge Zhong. According to defendant Qu, "Guangzhong Factory established the Erzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory and the Sanzhong Printing and Dyeing Factory in 1929. On October 15, 1938, the three factories were merged, which required an increase in capital. Later, the company was oppressed by the enemy and puppet regime, and Jin withdrew. The factory affairs were then entirely maintained by Zhang Diesheng. After the victory, the enemy property administration sealed up Guangzhong. After Jin came forward to request the unsealing, it was approved after review. Therefore, the allegations made by the plaintiffs should be the responsibility of Zhang Diesheng and have nothing to do with them," and so on. As a result, the court ordered the case to be adjourned for further review.

### Special Criminal Court Indicts Thirteen Defendants in the Lin-Wang and Other Three Companies' Foreign Exchange Racketeering Case; Zhou Zhendong Not Indicted Due to Insufficient Evidence

The case of illegal foreign exchange trading and black market gold speculation by Lin-Wang, Sanwei, and Dazhonghua and other three companies has been concluded by Prosecutor Li Yulong of the Special Criminal Court. He believes that the defendants Wang Chunzhe (manager of Lin-Wang Commercial Firm), Lin Tongshi (person in charge of the Shantou branch of Lin-Wang), Zheng Ligong (manager of Lin-Wang), Huang Yuanjue (manager of the foreign trade department of Sanwei Company), Zhang Yansheng (manager of Dazhonghua Film Enterprise Co., Ltd.), and the thirteen fugitives Chu Shunwei, Jiang Boying, Zheng Jiayu, Lin Mingjian, Zheng Tingjiao, Chen Yanquan, Zheng Xianting, and Ke Hai are to be publicly prosecuted. Defendant Zhou Zhendong (employee of Dazhonghua Film Enterprise Co., Ltd.) is not being prosecuted due to insufficient evidence. The following is a record of the facts of the crimes committed by the indicted defendants and the relevant legal provisions:

Facts of the Crime:

Lin-Wang (A) The Lin-Wang Commercial Firm was established by Wang Chunzhe and Lin Tongshi, named after their surnames, at 131 Beijing Road in Shanghai (formerly named Lin-Wang Company). It has a subsidiary, Liansheng Import and Export Company. Wang Chunzhe is the manager, and Zheng Jiayu and Zheng Ligong serve as deputy manager and manager, respectively. Ke Hai is an employee. There is a branch in Shantou, managed by Lin Tongshi and Lin Mingjian. There is also an affiliate in Hong Kong, which commissions Taikun Company Chen Yanquan, Zheng Tingjiao, and Zheng Xianting to act as agents, using the export of gauze and lace as a cover to apply to the government for foreign exchange allocations, engaging in the buying and selling of black market gold, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars, and using telecommunications to operate various foreign exchange transactions. They maintain private black market account books, using classified account names such as "Xiongji," "Zheji," "Yutuo," "Taikun," "Tongrong" (referring to joint operations), and "Lianfa" (referring to the Hong Kong affiliate) to record the amount of gold, foreign currency, and foreign exchange transactions. They use various codes such as "beans," "sugar," "rice," "flour," and "You" to represent gold, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars, and create coded numbers as methods for transaction settlement, communication, and accounting. Wang Chunzhe maintains checkbooks under the name of Wang Xiong (alias) at the Ruikangcheng Exchange and the Datong Bank, which have the same handwriting, specifically for the purpose of purchasing gold and paying funds. He also assigns Ke Hai to be responsible for purchasing gold, and establishes rooms at the Shanghai YMCA and the Cathay Hotel as secret trading venues. The business area extends to Washington and London. From September 1, 1947, to May 6, 1948, they bought and sold gold and foreign currency and operated foreign exchange business. The verifiable income included a total of HK$1,532,882.07 in Hong Kong dollars and Hong Kong foreign exchange, and a total of HK$1,894,612.06 in Hong Kong dollars and Hong Kong foreign exchange was paid out. The illegal Hong Kong foreign exchange amounted to HK$453,196.3. The income from US dollars and US foreign exchange totaled US$147,666.26, and the payments for US dollars and US foreign exchange totaled US$153,295.26. The illegal US foreign exchange was US$359,075, the illegal British foreign exchange was ¬£10,052, and 196.895 taels of gold were purchased and 196.544 taels were sold. Among them, 1,754 US dollars were exchanged for 30 taels of gold, and 10.325 taels of gold were exchanged for 557 US dollars. Wang Chunzhe also used the foreign currency earned from business to privately purchase linen, refrigerators, tires, and other imported goods in the United States, Britain, Belgium, and other places, which were imported without the approval of the Import and Export Management Committee, in an attempt to make profits.

Sanwei

(B) Sanwei Company: It has been found that the company was solely funded by Chu Shunwei, who hired Huang Yuanjue as the manager of the foreign trade department, responsible for managing import and export business. There is also a branch in Hong Kong. Since February 17, 1947, and then July 18, December 18, and December 25 of the same year, the Central Bank's Provisional Measures for Managing Foreign Exchange, the Outline for Implementing the Constitution of Mobilization to Suppress the Rebellion, and the Central Bank's Regulations on Foreign Exchange Management were promulgated and implemented. They successively applied to the Transportation Management Committee for approval of foreign exchange totaling US$10,406.71 in the name of the company to engage in foreign trade. The two discussed and deliberately violated the regulations on foreign exchange management with a huge amount of foreign currency earned from usual business, failing to report the purchases to the bank designated by the government, and separately deposited it in the London branch of Chartered Bank, totaling ¬£6,947 9 shillings and 8 pence; the Bombay branch of Chartered Bank, 202 rupees, 14 annas, and 5 pies; the Bombay branch of the Central Bank of China, 5 rupees, 9 annas, and 2 pies; and the Hong Kong branch of Chartered Bank, HK$33,487.88 and 5,970 rupees, plus HK$11.34. They then withdrew the full amount on October 31, 1947, and collected the Hong Kong branch's accounts of Sanwei Company in December of the same year. There are no legal proofs of how the company's remaining HK$30,000 was paid out from February 1 to 15, 1948. Huang Yuanjue also opened a current deposit account in the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of Shanghai under the name of Huang Ansheng. On February 29, 1948, the balance was HK$23,213.86, and HK$703 was paid out with check number (11.315). As of April 30 of the same year, the balance was HK$22,550.86, and the receipt and payment were not handled in accordance with the regulations on foreign exchange management. Afterwards, Chu Shunwei fled with the relevant important account books to avoid review.

Dazhonghua

(C) Dazhonghua Film Enterprise Co., Ltd.: Jiang Boying is the general manager of the company, and Zhang Yansheng is the manager, responsible for accounting. The head office is located in the Central Building on Central Road in Shanghai, and there are offices in Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong. According to regulations, foreign exchange is not provided for the import of films, but they remitted funds privately. From May to December 1947, the total amount of funds remitted from Chongqing to Guangzhou and then to Hong Kong was 2,008,200,000 national currency. From April 1947 to March 1948, the amount of "application for foreign exchange" reached 7,718,765,132.95 legal currency, equivalent to HK$324,202.51. The company concealed the head office's account books for the entire year of 1947 in the hope of avoiding investigation.

The above-mentioned Lin-Wang, Sanwei, and Dazhonghua commercial firms and companies, buying and selling gold and speculating in foreign exchange, were detected by the Oriental Economic Research Institute, which sent personnel to infiltrate the Lin-Wang Commercial Firm for investigation and conducted a trial gold trading transaction with Ke Hai. Subsequently, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau sent teams to Lin-Wang Commercial Firm and Room 611 of the Hua Ma Hotel, where they seized black market account books, telegrams, checks, receipts, various imported goods, and a pistol. In Sanwei and Dazhonghua companies, many account books related to foreign exchange business were seized. The relevant responsible persons Wang Chunzhe, Zheng Ligong, and Huang Yuanjue, along with the suspect Zhou Zhendong, were reported to the National Government and ordered to be sent to this court for investigation. Zheng Jiayu and others fled upon hearing the news. Lin Tongshi and Zhang Yansheng were successively summoned by this court.

Relevant Legal Provisions:

In summary, except for Zhou Zhendong, whose crime is insufficient, the defendants Wang Chunzhe, Lin Tongshi, Zheng Ligong, Zheng Jiayu, Chen Yanquan, Lin Mingjian, Zheng Tingjiao, Zheng Xianting, and Ke Hai, with a common overarching intention, continuously and jointly bought and sold gold and foreign currency and operated foreign exchange business. In accordance with Article 6 and Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Outline for Implementing the Constitution of Mobilization to Suppress the Rebellion, Article 4, Paragraph 3, Article 16, and Article 17 of the National General Mobilization Law, they should be punished in accordance with Article 11 and Article 56 of the Criminal Law, Article 28 of the Criminal Law, Article 1 of the Regulations on Penalties for Buying and Selling Gold and Foreign Currency, and Article 33 of the Central Bank's Regulations on Foreign Exchange Management. Huang Yuanjue and Chu Shunwei jointly operated illegal foreign exchange business. In accordance with Article 6 and Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Outline for Implementing the Constitution of Mobilization to Suppress the Rebellion and Article 17 of the National General Mobilization Law, they should be punished in accordance with Article 11 and Article 28 of the Criminal Law, Article 56 of the Criminal Law, and Article 33 of the Central Bank's Regulations on Foreign Exchange Management. Zhang Yansheng and Jiang Boying jointly operated illegal foreign exchange. In accordance with Article 6 and Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Outline for Implementing the Constitution of Mobilization to Suppress the Rebellion and Article 16 and Article 17 of the National General Mobilization Law, they should be punished in accordance with Article 11 and Article 28 of the Criminal Law and Article 33 of the Central Bank's Regulations on Foreign Exchange Management. Combined with Article 9 and Article 8, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Crimes Endangering the State During the Period of Rebellion and Article 2 of the Special Criminal Court Trial Regulations and Article 230, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, they are being prosecuted.

### Yunnanese Smugglers Illegally Transport Tungsten and Tin into Burma

[Report from Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 5th] Yunnanese merchants smuggling tungsten and tin into Burma is becoming increasingly rampant. According to a report from the Wan-ting warehouse of the Foreign Affairs Office of the National Resources Commission: Tusi (chieftains) from Longling, Mangshi, and Zhefang have indeed seized tungsten and tin that was hidden. Tin can be easily smuggled and sold in Burma at any time, while many people do not recognize tungsten. More than ten tons of tungsten, previously stored by the commission 13 kilometers from Wanting, had been scattered for more than a year. It was not until it was handed over in August 1946 that it was stolen by the Yi people of Longdao. It is estimated that there are approximately 30 tons of tungsten hidden in Mangshi and in the Longling warehouse. There is more private tin in the Jiazhong area of Zhefang Longdao, and most of it is hidden on the Burmese side of the river across from Jiazhong, which is 17 kilometers from Wanting. Tin transported privately from Longling is mostly transported north along the Longling Highway and enters Burma from Longzhou Bamo. Tin from Zhefang is transported along Longdao by bamboo raft downstream, and Moxai has become a gathering place for tungsten and tin smugglers. It is said that each piece of tin can be sold for 120 shields from Yunnan to Burma, and each ton of tungsten is worth about 800 shields. It is also reported that the office stationed in Kunming dispatched Fan Maoxian to western Yunnan to supervise and urge the purchase of tin because tungsten merchant Zhang Qingaog was unable to deliver the tin as agreed. Zhang then purchased the tin from Longdao. It is confirmed that the central government has ordered the Yunnan Police Headquarters to instruct the transportation security authorities to conduct strict inspections at the Yunnan-Burma border.

Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

### Questions Regarding Supreme Court Civil Litigation Judgments

Asked by Gao Liwu (1) Is there any legal provision regarding the length of time for the Supreme Court to issue a civil litigation judgment? (2) If a Supreme Court case has not been judged for a long time, if an application is made to the Ministry of Judicial Administration or the Control Yuan for remedy, will the "Ministry" or "Yuan" accept it, or is there another Supreme Court-affiliated ministry or yuan that can be appealed to by the party concerned, or a lawsuit filed with the Supreme Court? (3) If the judicial filing procedures are cumbersome, do people need to submit petitions to the "Ministry" or "Yuan" through local administrative or judicial institutions? (4) The Jiangsu Higher Court's judgment in the thirty-fifth year on the debt repayment rate, the other party has not yet fulfilled it. Now that the ratio has changed, can an application be made to change the precedent? Is the application institution still the Higher Court or can the local court also do it?

[Answered by Lawyer Fu Kuanglin] (1) There are indeed no time limits for the Supreme Court to accept and judge third-instance civil litigation. (2) The Supreme Court's civil division accepts third-instance civil litigation cases from all provinces, counties, and cities in the country. The urgency of handling cases depends on the speed of the second instance's case files being sent, that is, the second instance's case files have been sent for a considerable period of time. And it must be assigned to various courts for handling by the chief clerk of the court, and after a considerable period of time, if it has not been judged for a long time, the only thing to do is to submit a statement stating the year and number of the case to urge the Supreme Court. The Ministry of Judicial Administration has no right to intervene, and the Control Yuan does not involve illegal or derelict officials, so it is inconvenient to interfere. (3) There is no need to submit it through a lower court, but directly submit a written petition. (4) Reasons can be added to apply for increased payment.

### The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee will be dissolved by the end of this month; manufacturers will have complete freedom to purchase cotton in the future.

The order to abolish the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee was personally brought here by Chairman Wang Fengseng yesterday morning when he arrived in Shanghai from Beijing. According to Mr. Wang, the committee is currently urging various departments to rush to complete the dissolution process, which will be completed before the end of the month. In the future, merchants and factories will be completely free to handle domestic cotton picking, transporting, purchasing, and selling matters, and will not be subject to any government control. As for exports, such as visa approval, and the use of U.S. cotton for substitute spinning and weaving, the government will formulate another plan and hand it over to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to set up an institution to handle it. Mr. Wang also stated that promoting the export of yarn and cloth, earning foreign exchange, and preventing the international market from becoming deserted are urgent matters. The government has long considered this issue. There was a proposal to establish a cotton yarn and cloth import and export company after the dissolution of this committee, the main purpose of which is to do just that. Once it is realized, its administrative management should belong to the government, and business contacts should be carried out through official-business cooperation. However, the Textile Construction Company already has an export agency attached to it, so it seems that private companies still need to be organized separately.

[Further News] According to the Foreign Clamp Association, because the association is one of the affiliated institutions of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee has been ordered to be dissolved by the end of this month, and the association will also be dissolved accordingly. However, the current problem is the U.S. aid cotton. It was previously agreed that the Yarn Management Committee and the Foreign Sales Committee would each take charge of it. The Yarn Management Committee uses it to allocate to various manufacturers, and the Foreign Sales Committee uses it to produce yarn and cloth for export. This plan has also been approved by the U.S. Aid Committee. Now, it is reported that the first batch of emergency allocation of U.S. cotton, worth 13.7 million U.S. dollars, has been approved by the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration and can be used. The warehouse receipt can be taken out for customs declaration within days, and it is expected that the goods can be picked up within ten days. Therefore, the establishment of a new institution is a matter of great urgency.

### Abnormally Loose Monetary Conditions, Shanghai Stock Market Fluctuates and Rises Slightly

Shanghai stocks repeatedly tried to rally yesterday, but buying interest could not be fully realized due to concerns about the new economic plan. The process was mediocre and mostly sideways, and ended in a slight show of strength due to unprecedentedly loose monetary conditions.

At the beginning of the morning, the market opened high due to the indecision of the economic countermeasures and many rumors of helping securities purchases. Yong Yarn opened at 12,250 yuan, and No. 89, No. 183, No. 154, No. 218, No. 11, and No. 65 advanced to 12,550 yuan. No. 179, No. 99, No. 55, No. 153, No. 205, No. 216, No. 30, No. 102, and No. 185 were sold, and the price retreated to 12,300 yuan. Although No. 213, No. 98, No. 143, No. 187, and No. 206 advanced, the selling interest of No. 3, No. 83, No. 65, No. 185, and No. 89 was still strong, and the price retreated to 12,270 yuan. Yarn and cloth rebounded, and No. 89, No. 126, No. 76, No. 13, No. 206, No. 163, No. 156, No. 76, and No. 145 advanced to 12,600 yuan. No. 222, No. 154, No. 56, No. 116, No. 148, No. 135, No. 213, No. 61, and No. 207 were all sold, but the price still could not be supported, and the midday close fell to 12,330 yuan. Except for Lianhua's limit up, China-France Xinhua Match, Tongyi, and Xinyi remained flat, and Huafeng and China Silk slightly declined, the rest all rose slightly.

In the afternoon market, Yong Yarn opened at 12,700 yuan. No. 76, No. 205, and No. 54 first sold to 12,580 yuan. No. 134, No. 145, No. 85, No. 95, No. 89, No. 104, No. 169, and No. 176 advanced to 12,830 yuan. No. 180, No. 152, No. 12, No. 99, No. 169, No. 89, and No. 95 closed out, and the price fell back to 12,680 yuan. There were very strong calls in the market for suspending the afternoon market, and trading was virtually interrupted for a long time. No. 137, No. 190, No. 143, and No. 72 absorbed the selling pressure and rose to 12,820 yuan. No. 169, No. 179, and No. 145 closed out, and the market closed at 12,750 yuan. Xinguang worked hard to rally on its own, and the situation was quite good. Compared with the morning close, in addition to Liandi and Yongye's limit up, Tongyi and China Silk Zhabei rose by half, Hengfeng remained flat, and the rest all rose slightly. In the over-the-counter market, Huashang, Dasheng, Huacheng, and Zhonghua saw a good performance, each rising by half, while the rest were only stable.

Government bonds showed fatigue again yesterday. Unified bonds opened at 1.22 million in the morning, then fell to 1.03 million, and then closed at 1.18 million. Room 500 bought in, while Room 550 and Chengde sold out. Room 360 bought in first and then sold out, while Room 552 sold out first and then bought in. Compared with the previous close, A, B, and D bonds were 60,000 yuan lower, C bonds fell 70,000 yuan, and E bonds fell 40,000 yuan. The turnover was 3 million yuan.

### Alleviate the Panic of Cash Shortage 5 Million Yuan Banknotes to be Issued

Central Bank Authority Tells Banks and Money Shops that they will be officially issued around the 10th.

Since the announcement of the issuance of large banknotes, the only ones circulating in the market so far are 10,000, 25,000, and 50,000 gold standard notes. However, the number of 25,000 and 50,000 yuan notes issued is very small, resulting in a shortage of cash in the market. In the past few days, due to the increase in funds flowing into Shanghai from various places, the panic has increased. Currently, the cash premium has reached 80 million yuan for every 1 billion yuan. The National Bank's cash allocation quota for each major bank is 20 billion yuan, making it impossible to circulate. Most banks issue bank drafts to pay customers, so the number of bank drafts issued by various banks has been quite large in recent days. Some large stores have also begun to accept bank drafts from major banks as usual. According to reporters' investigation, the National Bank is paying close attention to the cash shortage and is doing its best to find a solution, and is rushing to print various large banknotes. The 250,000 yuan face value gold standard, which was originally scheduled to be issued at the end of the month, is also being rushed to print. It is said that it can be officially issued around the 10th, and Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor of the National Bank, has officially stated to the banks and money shops that the cash shortage can be resolved after the 10th.

[This Newspaper] A phenomenon of cash shortage has occurred in the market these days, and the banking and money industry has held a special meeting to resolve the difficulty. According to the Central Bank, the National Bank is doing its best to solve the problem of cash withdrawal for banks, and has never restricted it, but the cash is relatively small and insufficient for allocation. Moreover, the current face value of currency is obviously too small compared with the price, and the amount of various payments has increased sharply with the changes in prices. This is the real reason for the cash shortage. Once the 5 million yuan banknote is issued, this problem can be solved.

### Extremely Loose Monetary Conditions, Banks Showed Large Deficits Yesterday

Yesterday's monetary conditions were loose, but cash was still in short supply. In the check exchange of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury, there was an unprecedentedly huge deficit due to the payment of foreign exchange settlement and remittances from various places, totaling 47.92 billion. Among them, the Central Bank's deficit of 20.991 billion was the largest. The Bank of China's deficit was 11.377 billion, the Bank of Communications' deficit was 14.734 billion, the Farmers Bank's deficit was 2.936 billion, and the China Trust Bureau's surplus was 2.998 billion. The Postal Remittance Bureau's deficit was 133 million, and the Central Cooperative Treasury's deficit was 747 million. The commercial banks' large exchange had a surplus of 10.351 billion, the small exchange had a surplus of 5.768 billion, and the foreign banks had a total surplus of 31.801 billion.

### The Market Price of Exchange Settlement Certificates Rose Again, Close to the Black Market Rate of U.S. Exchange

[This Newspaper] The market price of foreign exchange settlement certificates has risen sharply in recent days, reaching 6 million yesterday, close to the black market rate of U.S. exchange. As a result, the export industry has also become more active. Taking tung oil as an example, the New York market price converted to 140 million yuan per dan, while the internal price is 130 million yuan per dan. The New York market price of hog bristles converted to national currency is 2.3 billion per sima dan, and the domestic price is 1.8 billion per zu dong, which is still profitable. Therefore, the transaction of export materials has become more active in recent days. It is said that the rise in the price of exchange settlement certificates is mainly because the Export Management Committee has recently issued a large number of import licenses for various oils, and the need for conversion has increased, so the market has also improved. People in the import and export industry estimate that if the distance between the market price of exchange settlement certificates and the black market rate of U.S. exchange can be kept below 20%, there will be no problem with exports, and the phenomenon of export smuggling can also be eliminated.

### Public Sentiment Turned Strong, Sales Became Active, Rice Prices Rose Consistently, White Rice Exceeded the 40 Million Yuan Mark Again

Rice prices rebounded, monetary conditions remained loose, and the huge price increases of public utilities turned the depressed public sentiment into strength. Rice shops saw frequent purchases at low prices, and sales became active. The market rose after opening, and the Nanshi market rose by 1.5 million to 3 million, with white rice exceeding 40 million again. Indica rice and glutinous rice rose by 2 million uniformly. The Beishi market rose less, with japonica and indica rising by 1 million each, and premium japonica remaining flat. Yesterday's arrivals in the North and South markets totaled 2,752 shih.

The price increase of public utilities increased the cost of flour, and the transportation cost also increased. The loose monetary conditions increased the appetite of retail investors. Old car flour rose from 13.2 million to 13.75 million, and there were more transactions of military vessel flour, closing at 13.25 million. The former rose by 500,000, and the latter rose by 750,000. Miscellaneous brand flour rose by 300,000 to 400,000 uniformly, and large bags of wheat bran rose by 500,000.

Miscellaneous grains showed a unified upward trend. Monetary conditions were extremely loose, customer appetite increased, and due to reasons such as increased transportation costs, soybeans rose by 1 million, and corn and yuan wheat rose by 1 million to 2 million each under the acquisition of the northern gang. The arrival of broad beans was not much, and the price increased by 1 million. Green beans were actively sold and rose by 2 million to 3 million. There was more disposal of sesame seeds on this street, and the price also increased by 2 million to 3 million. A small number of shelled peanuts were traded, with Xuzhou shelled peanuts at 65 million.

Edible oil prices rose due to very loose monetary conditions, retail investors bought more on dips, and the rising prices of raw material soybeans and public utilities increased costs. Most factories opened for sale of soybean oil at 87 million, and the closing price rose to 90 million for returned goods. Vegetable oil closed at 83 million, with each rising by 7 million to 8 million. Raw oil rose by 10 million, and a barrel of raw oil was 117 million. The market for bean cake, which was absorbed by retail investors, turned upward, rising by 600,000 to 700,000.

### Tea Market Prices Rise

Yesterday's tea market showed even greater potential, with prices rising across the board. The factors contributing to this rise include: (1) relaxed monetary policy and an oversupply of money, leading to a general increase in commodity prices; (2) increased costs for public utilities and shipping; (3) export settlement certificates initially reaching 6.2 million, and although later falling slightly below that, market confidence remains strong. Therefore, there is hope for further price increases in the future.

It is also reported that to assist exports and secure more foreign exchange, the authorities, through the Four Joint Banks, are offering mortgage loans for exported tea. Initially, the loan amount was set at 10 million Ê≥ïÂπ£ per dan (a unit of weight), but due to currency value fluctuations, this amount is no longer practically sufficient. Recently, Tang, the chairman of the Tea Exporters Association of this city, and others met with Yu Hongjun, the governor of the Central Bank, to express their concerns. Yu expressed sympathy and promised to discuss the matter at a meeting early next week.

### Increase in Returned Checks

[Our Report] The number of returned checks at Taishi banks was higher on Monday (the 2nd), totaling 4,041, exceeding the previous week's high of 3,789 by 252. The total amount of the returned checks was 883.3 billion, exceeding the previous week's high of 662.73992 billion by 200.58008 billion. On Tuesday, both the number and total amount of returned checks decreased, but the total amount was still higher than the previous week, with 2,828 returned checks totaling 741.1 billion. On Wednesday, 2,503 returned checks totaled 836.6 billion.

### Large Shipment of Timber Arrives in Shanghai

It is currently berthed at buoys 33 and 34 for unloading. Additionally, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Hailu" vessel returned to Shanghai from Fuzhou yesterday, carrying over 16,000 pieces of timber, and is currently berthed at buoys 3 and 4 for unloading.

### Cotton Yarn Prices Increase

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw the Cotton Yarn Control Committee continue to release four types of yarn, but prices generally increased by over 100 million, boosting market confidence at the opening. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn jumped 110 million immediately upon opening for tomorrow's delivery. Current delivery prices were also good, rising by 50 to 60 million. There was a slight pullback in the middle of the day. Recently, buyers from Tianjin and Guangdong continued to purchase actively, and local traders were also keen, causing sellers to hold firm on prices. The final price for current delivery was 2.005 billion, and tomorrow's delivery was 2.1 billion, up 50 to 60 million from the previous day. Prices for other coarse and fine yarns also generally increased by 70 to 80 million, 110 to 120 million, and 230 to 240 million, respectively. Only 43 lots were traded.

### Cotton Cloth in Short Supply

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened with uncertainty due to rumors of a new economic policy being announced next week, causing prices to fluctuate. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially opened strong, with prices jumping 4.3 million due to occasional purchases. Later, some sellers took profits on the higher prices from the previous day, causing prices to fall by 700,000 to 800,000 around 10 a.m. At that time, there was little downward pressure, but due to the Central Bank's large-scale lending and easier monetary policy, buyers from Tianjin and Hankou were actively replenishing their stocks. In addition, public utility costs had increased sharply, raising factory costs, and it was rumored that the Spinning & Weaving Company was only producing Dragon Head B-grade fine cloth and 3A ÂΩ©ÁêÉÁªÜÂ∏É. Market sentiment was revived, and confidence was exceptionally strong. Dragon Head fine cloth closed at 59.2 million, up 5.7 million from the previous day. After the market closed, prices rose further to 9.35 million with buyers accepting that price.

### Hong Kong's Exchange Control Measures Affect Yarn and Cloth Exports

[Hong Kong Special Report] Since the revised export certificate measures were implemented, all exported goods, except those shipped to China and the Sterling Area, must be exchanged with the government. The first to be affected by this measure are Siam and Vietnam. According to these exchange control measures, it is equivalent to a linked system. All goods exported to these two regions must be accounted for with the Financial Secretary, and at the same time, goods must be imported from Siam to Hong Kong, and both parties must offset their accounts to pay for the goods. In other words, those who ship goods to Siam must ship goods back from Siam to Hong Kong to offset the cost. Cotton yarn and cloth merchants were the first to be affected by this measure. Most Siamese firms are not yet clear on the exchange control measures, so many have temporarily stopped taking in goods. As a result, the cotton yarn market has been quiet, and even the once-popular 40-count single yarn has been affected. In the cloth market,Êâ£Â∏É, ÁôΩÂ∏É, and Áî≤ÈªëÂ∏É, which are mostly sold to Siam, have also been slightly affected due to the aforementioned reasons. It is reported that recent purchasing interest from the Dutch East Indies has been slow. Hong Kong's cotton yarn relies on exports to the Dutch East Indies and Siam, and with neither region purchasing, the market is bound to fall. As for the cloth market, it is still supported by Singapore, so the fall is less significant. According to related sources, Siamese firms that usually purchase cotton yarn and cloth are mostly acting as agents and rarely ship goods from Siam to Hong Kong. These firms will be significantly affected by this measure.

### Spring Cocoon Reeling Loan

Jiangsu and Zhejiang reach over 750 billion

This year's spring cocoon reeling loan, started by the Farmers Bank of China, has reached 76 manufacturers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with a loan amount of over 750 billion. Jiangsu accounts for over 550 billion, and the rest is from Zhejiang. According to the regulations, there are 86 qualified loan factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang this year, including 5 in Shanghai and Suzhou, 50 in Wuxi, and the rest are in various parts of Zhejiang. It is also stipulated that loans will only be given to manufacturers who can prove that they have started production after the cocoon collection loan is completed.

### Tin and Antimony Sales in Hong Kong are Active

This year, the sales of both tin and antimony in Hong Kong have been very active. Except for antimony, which is managed by the Resources Commission, both official and private merchants ship pure tin to Hong Kong. At the same time, they are directly shipped from Yunnan and Guangxi production areas to Guangzhou and then to Hong Kong. Merchants from Nanyang, Calcutta, and India also come to purchase. The actual sales in Hong Kong itself were originally very scarce, but in recent years, with the relocation of Chinese factories to Hong Kong, the actual sales have increased compared to before. Currently, the price of pure tin in the Shanghai market is 12 billion per ton for transactions among peers, and 11.5 billion for large quantities. The price of antimony is 3.2 billion per ton. It is also reported that the imports from Hong Kong to Shanghai are mainly brass angles and 92% red copper. The former sells for 100 Hong Kong dollars per dan, and the latter sells for 74 Hong Kong dollars per dan. The fall in these market prices is mainly due to fluctuations in the Hong Kong exchange rate.

### Important Match in Basketball Tournament: Our Team Loses to the Philippines, Weakening Hopes of Reaching the Final Week

[Central News Agency, London, 5th] Our basketball team participating in the Olympics lost to the Philippines last night at the Harringay Arena with a score of 51 to 32. This was an important match in this group, and the loss significantly diminishes their chances. Although our team fought hard throughout the 40 minutes, they struggled to cope with the Philippines' agility. They could not take the initiative against such a strong opponent. In the preliminary round, our team adopted a defensive strategy, which prevented the Philippines from succeeding. Bao Songyuan scored eight points at this time and worked hard to stop the enemy team from attacking. After a 15-minute tug-of-war, the Philippines suddenly became active and took a 13-point lead in the first half. In the second half, the Philippines' teamwork became tighter, their shooting became more accurate, and their momentum increased. Our forwards could not penetrate the enemy's defense, and except for Bao Songyuan, the performances of the other players were not as good as usual. Our team made several substitutions, but they did not help. With this loss, our team's hopes of reaching the finals are slim. Because in the second group (our team belongs to this group), the two leading teams, Chile and the Philippines, have only lost one match each. Only if these two teams fail again can the points of the Chinese and Korean teams be equal to the points of the Chilean and Philippine teams. According to the Olympics basketball competition rules, if the points are equal, the ranking will be determined by the scoring average. The team with the higher score comes first. So far, our team has scored 155 points, the Philippines has scored 227 points, Chile has scored 248 points, and Korea has scored 230 points (the negative scores of each team have been deducted). If the points are equal, our team will need to score about 150 points in the match against the Iraqi team, while the other three teams will give Iraq over 100 points.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 4th] In today's Olympic basketball match between China and the Philippines, the Chinese team was unfortunately defeated by a score of 32 to 51 due to physical fatigue. Although the Chinese basketball team lost to the Philippines today, the skills of the Chinese players, especially Cai Wenhua and Li Zhenzhong, still won the applause of the audience. The speed of both sides was so fast that the referees also had difficulty keeping up.

[Associated Press, Harringay, 4th] In the second group of the basketball tournament, the "rapidly rising" Chinese team could not create another miracle on the evening of the 4th and bowed to the Philippines with a score of 51 to 32. After the Philippines beat China and Belgium beat Chile last night, the future of the Chinese team depends on the results of the Chile-Korea and Philippines-Belgium matches tonight. The following are several possible developments: (1) If Chile beats Korea and the Philippines beats Belgium, Chile and the Philippines will each have 9 points and lead the second group. China can get 8 points and rank third, and Belgium and Korea can get 7 points and rank fourth and fifth. (2) If Chile beats Korea and the Philippines loses to Belgium, Chile will lead with 9 points, and China, the Philippines, and Belgium will each get 8 points and tie for third place. (3) If Chile loses to Korea and the Philippines beats Belgium, the Philippines will lead with 9 points, and China, Chile, and Korea will each get 8 points and rank second. (4) If Korea beats Chile and Belgium beats the Philippines, then China, the Philippines, Korea, Chile, and Belgium in the second group will all have 8 points and be tied.

### Our Team Wins Against Korea in the Olympic Basketball Tournament; A Scene of Jubilation

[British News Agency, London, 5th] It is generally believed here that, apart from last night's game between China and Korea, no other basketball preliminary games have produced surprising results. The Chinese basketball team's excellent sportsmanship was the key to their victory with a score of 49 to 48. In the first half, Korea led with a score of 28 to 16. Although the Chinese team tried their best to counterattack in the second half, it was until the end of the third quarter. Most of the overseas Chinese spectators thought there was little chance of victory, especially since the Korean team was still in the lead before the end of the game. However, in the last five minutes, the Chinese team desperately "boosted" their morale. Li Shiqiao, number eight, made some admirable long shots. His success deeply moved the other team members, so they scored as many as sixteen points in five minutes. In the last minute, the Chinese team had a free throw opportunity, but it did not go into the net and was snatched by the Korean team, who charged straight to the Chinese side. At this time, Li Shiqiao immediately grabbed the ball, rushed to the enemy line, and with the superb skill of hitting the target from a hundred paces away, threw the ball into the net one second before the end of the game. The British spectators were extremely admiring of Li Shiqiao's ball skills, and his occasional amazing moves often made the audience shout "Shorty" incessantly. Especially in the last few minutes, the sound of cheering was continuous. The Mandarin and Cantonese announcers of the British Broadcasting Corporation also shouted loudly, surprising the technicians in the company's control room. After the game, the Chinese team members lifted Li Shiqiao high, sometimes raising his feet above their heads. The overseas Chinese also gathered at the edge of the iron net to get a glimpse of him.

The new education must have faith and constantly cultivate oneself, so that the spirit has a basis and the soul does not feel lost, laying the foundation for teaching and cultivation.

Then, former Director of the National Education Department of the Ministry of Education, Mr. Gu Shusen, was invited to deliver a speech.

### Acting President Wang of Jiaotong University Admonishes Students for the First Time

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] After taking office, Wang Zhizhuo, acting president of Jiaotong University, issued a public notice yesterday, admonishing students about their behavior on campus. He stated: "Before leaving the school, President Cheng made a written announcement to the students, in which the points raised revealed the school's atmosphere. His earnest words cannot but be moving. If things continue as they are, it will not only damage the school's reputation but also be a self-inflicted abandonment. We must follow what he said, review the past, and encourage the future. Here, I temporarily set a few of the most basic and easiest to implement points as follows: (1) Students in the school dormitory may not allow outsiders to stay unless specially approved. (2) After the school has designated the addresses of boarding students and social organizations, they may not move privately or forcibly occupy houses. (3) All kinds of gatherings and performances must be approved by the school before they can be held. They cannot create an accomplished fact and then ask for recognition. (4) Freedom of speech is permitted, but actions must be disciplined."

### Ministry of Education to Announce Revised Secondary School Curriculum Standards After Summer; Director Wu Zhaotang Presides Over Symposium; Broadly Soliciting Opinions from Excellent Teachers

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of Education's revision of the secondary school curriculum standards has been completed in draft form. To further improve them, a symposium was held at 9:00 AM on the 4th, bringing together outstanding teachers of various subjects from public and private secondary schools in Beijing who have many years of practical teaching experience to solicit their opinions. Zhang Zhenyu, section chief of the Secondary Education Department of the Ministry of Education, and more than 20 secondary school teachers, including Chen Chongyin, attended. Director Wu Zhaotang presided over the meeting. The attendees agreed that the revised draft was a significant improvement over the current standards, and generally complete.

There were also slight revisions to the wording. The results were satisfactory, and the meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. It is heard that the Ministry of Education will revise the entire plan based on the opinions from this symposium. After the Minister has reviewed it for the final time, it will be announced after the summer.

### Idle Talk About the American Election

‚Äî Green Man

The editor of Life magazine is a sarcastic person. He used most of a page to publish a photo of Truman giving a campaign speech. The auditorium was very large, but the audience only filled the first few rows. Most of the space in the photo was empty seats. The editor did not let up, and in the caption, he lightly said that Truman's campaign speech produced an unbelievable fact: he still had the courage to be complacent!

In fact, we might as well say that Truman's ability to attract an audience today is not even as good as Wallace. Wallace's speeches required tickets, but they were often packed, with people standing to listen to his speech filling the gaps in the venue.

However, this does not mean that Wallace will create any miracles in this election. Although he is eloquent, it should be noted that he has made many enemies, which is the biggest taboo in American election traditions. With Taft's aristocratic reputation and years of careful preparation for the election, he still lost in the Republican National Convention. The main reason was that he was unpopular.

Every American secretly wants to be president, but those few who are actively campaigning are truly pervasive and extremely hardworking. According to the U.S. Constitution, a U.S. President only needs to be over 35 years old, born in the U.S., and have resided in the U.S. for more than 14 years. But the actual conditions are much more demanding: he must be from a "large" state, be white, believe in Protestantism, be a good husband and father in the family, be extremely proper, love farming life, be able to catch a few fish, and have the patience to read a few pages of detective novels in bed.

After meeting these conditions, he must also be able to campaign seriously. Campaigning is not easy. "There is no shortcut to the White House." A candidate must start planning everything patiently several years in advance. He must know the art of bargaining and have real "drive."

Planning everything behind the presidential candidate is his "campaign manager." This person must have extremely high organizational skills, be a propaganda genius, and be able to make everyone feel that they have gained the upper hand even when suffering a defeat. The most important thing is: he must pay close attention to the likes and dislikes of voters, then seize the "opportunity" and prescribe the right medicine to ensure that every move of the candidate can win the favor of the public.

When a candidate sets out to campaign, his entire course of action must be planned in detail in advance. The campaign manager first sends people out to prepare, and when the candidate arrives, the campaign workers tell him what things are particularly important in this place and how he should speak. When he gives a speech, the campaign workers have already been scattered in the audience, and as soon as he finishes speaking, they will ask one or two questions to praise him, and sometimes take the lead in applauding to arouse everyone's agreement.

Of course, the candidate himself also understands the trick of "saying the right things to the right people," and contradictions are inevitable. Stetson suffered this loss in this campaign. His enemies collected his speech records and deliberately broadcast two contradictory ones on the radio at the same time, putting Stetson in an awkward position.

When Dewey was giving a speech in Nebraska, a dog suddenly came onto the stage. According to the United Press, Dewey then ordered the dog to be driven out. This made Dewey's campaign manager anxious - wouldn't countless men and women who love dogs in the United States become disgusted with Dewey? So he hurriedly asked for a correction. They said that what Dewey said after seeing the dog was: "Hey, you came to be with us too, didn't you? - It's just like the hunting dog I had in my hometown of Owosso, Michigan, when I was a child."

In addition, Dewey's refusal to wear the Indian headdress full of feathers also made his campaign manager quite uneasy. He was worried that he would lose some Native American votes because of this.

When Taft was campaigning in Texas, he went to watch a ball game to show his love for sports. The game was wonderful, but Taft fell asleep on the platform in full view of everyone! This one wrong move must have cost him many votes.

A U.S. President also needs a condition - Dewey passed, and he won the initial victory; Martin, Taft, Stetson, and MacArthur failed, and they failed.

What condition?

First, wireless image transmission is now very common; second, everyone is vying for America's considerable number of female voters - therefore, presidential candidates must be quite handsome!

Martin, the Speaker of the House who failed in the Republican nomination, touched his chin and said, "I don't know why, my beard always looks like it hasn't been shaved for a few weeks." And this may be one of the reasons for his defeat.

### Remembering Rao Hanxiang

‚Äî Chen Zuogao

In the early years of the Republic of China, the literary world was full of talented people, and Rao Hanxiang can be said to be the first among them who rose to prominence from humble beginnings. Hanxiang's courtesy name was Bisheng, or Misheng, and he was from Hubei. He was a successful candidate in the late Qing Dynasty Guimao imperial examination. In his early years, he studied with Fan Fanshan, and his poetry and prose were grand and beautiful, and his calligraphy was exquisite. His teacher admired him deeply. He was especially familiar with the Book of Han, and he held a volume in his hand all day long, reciting it with self-satisfaction. If someone questioned him with doubts, he would answer fluently. He, Feng Junmu, who specialized in Records of the Grand Historian, and Zhang Taiyan Guangsheng, who was proficient in the Book of Han, could be regarded as a tripod standing on three legs.

Rao had an unusual appearance. He spoke quickly, spitting everywhere, and the dishes were a mess. He liked to pour the remaining soup into the soup bowl. He was initially a waiting-for-appointment salt commissioner in Fujian and a member of the General Affairs Section of the Education Affairs Office. His colleagues all hated his messiness and regarded eating with him as a misery, so he was lonely and felt depressed. At that time, Yao Wenzhuo, the education commissioner, was a scholar with extensive learning. He knew that he was different from the crowd and treated him with some respect. However, most of his subordinates were virtuous scholars from all over the world, such as Chen Baochen and Jiang Chunlin, who were all chairmen of committees appointed by one hand. Although he was elegant, it was difficult for him to win favor alone. In his residence, he was always unable to stretch himself, so he angrily sought to leave.

After returning to Hubei, he was poorly dressed and bored. He had the opportunity to meet Li Yuanhong, and Yuanhong immediately became friends with him, praising him as the Jiang Lang of the day and entrusting him with the important task of [illegible character] chamber. When he became president, he promoted Hanxiang to secretary-general, succeeding Tang Hualong. During this period, Li sent several telegrams, and the writing was excellent, and it is still widely praised today. It is said that they were all written by Hanxiang. According to what I know, this is mostly untrue. When he was in the old capital, he once said to my father: "The first few telegrams were actually drafts by my teacher Fan Fanshan. He is old and does not want to show his name, but because Hanxiang is his student, he is willing to do it for him. The world does not understand the source of this matter, so the facts are contrary to reality." My father was once the section chief of the Education Affairs Office and was very familiar with Hanxiang, treating him with great respect. Hanxiang also regarded him as a confidant, so he revealed all the secrets without hiding anything.

I remember that after he became a high official, he visited my father many times at his residence in the old capital, expressing his heartfelt sincerity. My father had given up his career and had no expectations, so after returning the visit, he returned to Shanghai. Before long, Hanxiang sent a letter again, saying that he had missed the opportunity to welcome him before and was disappointed that he had already returned south. The letter was not reproachful, showing his old friendship, and so on. It can be seen from this that he had no official airs at all. Those in the world who like to change their attitude with their position, can they not be ashamed when they see this? Later, he joined Guo Songling, a great general outside the customs. When Songling was defeated, Hanxiang also died in depression, leaving a daughter but no son. Is this what is meant by the waxing and waning, and the mixture of good and bad fortune?

### Linking Talk

‚Äî Ren Yi

Some couplets use repeated characters. In a previous issue, Mr. Jianqiu's "Miscellaneous Talk on Couplets" mentioned the "Pinghu Autumn Moon" couplet in West Lake, which is indeed excellent. There is another couplet in West Lake, with one character repeated, which is even more wonderful. The couplet says: "Green, green, red, red, everywhere orioles and swallows; wind, wind, rain, rain, year after year, dawn after dusk." Only ten characters, but it captures all the scenery of West Lake.

I occasionally looked through old papers and found a few old magazines. With nothing to do in the long summer, I used them for entertainment. I saw a clever antithetical couplet that said: "The moon in the sky is full, the moon on earth is half, every month the full moon meets the half. Today is the end of the year, tomorrow is the beginning of the year, year after year the end of the year connects the beginning of the year."

About a mile outside the south gate of my hometown, Yixing, there is a long embankment across the Jingxi River. It is said that General Yue Wu Mu of the Song Dynasty built it to pursue the Jin soldiers, so it is named "Yue Embankment." There is a small pavilion on the side of the embankment, surrounded by water on three sides, with excellent scenery. Some Yixing people have written couplets to commemorate the scenic spot. Zhou Zuyuan's couplet: "The caring water moon makes you suspect there is no road; leisurely talk about the spring waves at the Curved Water Pavilion." Cheng Zhe'an's couplet: "The small court that crossed south, only the long embankment remains for thousands of years. The old Chan monastery in the east neighborhood, sometimes hears the sound of clear chimes." The east corner of the pavilion is the site of the former Sisui Nunnery. There is a couplet by Chu Jianweng: "Wind and rain all year round are unobstructed; the rivers and mountains for ten thousand years admire this loyalty." During the War of Resistance, the Yue Pavilion was destroyed by artillery fire, and the couplets in the pavilion have become a lost melody of Guangling, which is a great pity.

There is a couplet for a God of Wealth temple, where each character comes from "„ÄÄ", which is quite unique. The couplet says: "Far and near, the Tao reaches for carefree passage; advancing and retreating, the connection returns when fortune is met."

### Remembering A Yi

‚Äî Bai Jiao

The child's writing is not yet finished, his fingers are suddenly black, the small ball is not to be seen, his loud voice is filled with tears, wipe away the tears, and the double circles of ink are revealed.

He loves fatty meat when eating vegetables, and he is quite foolish when there is nothing to do. Scissors are always in his hand, and shredded paper suddenly fills the room. He does not walk well, he has songs when he opens his mouth, sometimes he pulls grandpa's nose, sometimes he covers grandpa's eyes, he wants grandpa to breathe quickly, he wants grandpa not to read.

Going out to learn to dress up, he is especially happy in front of the mirror, dabbing rouge red on his forehead, and applying fragrant powder white to his hair. Suddenly he makes a funny face, laughs at himself and cherishes himself.

The sound of books is temporarily stopped, he tilts his head and sleeps soundly, he suddenly wakes up again when he gets into bed, his hands and feet are quite stiff, the nanny tells stories, he asks his mother for food and drink, he takes out peanuts from his bag, and peanuts fill the bed.

### Random Musings from Ziluoban'an

‚Äî Shoujuan

The late great Polish musician, Mr. Paderewski, was known throughout the world as a virtuoso pianist. During the First World War in Europe, he no longer associated with the keys. When asked why, he said with emotion, "In these times of such chaos and unrest, how can I have the heart to continue with music!" I, too, feel similarly this year. I secretly wish to burn my inkstone like Jun Miao, no longer to be a slave to writing. However, when my heart is touched, I cannot help but speak, for the pain of mourning my late wife has yet to be relieved. Counting from the passing of my late wife, Feng Jun, it has already been over two years. Wars rage on, and life becomes increasingly difficult. Even if she were still alive, she would be worried and withered to death. It would be better if she had never seen this at all. In these two years, besides treasuring her daily belongings, I have also sought out plants and animals associated with the phoenix, placing them in the Fenglaiyi room, so that seeing these objects may ease the pain of longing. My close friends, Zhao Ziyun, Cai Zhenyuan, and Zhang Qixian, have each gifted me with fine varieties of balsam, including the White Crane Top, Red Crane Top, Purple Crane Top, Pink Crane Top, and speckled and powdered gold varieties. Brother Fan Ziming has also gifted me with phoenix-tail bamboo and large phoenix monthly roses, their sincere intentions deeply appreciated! It is a pity that a sage has not appeared in this world, for I deeply regret not being able to acquire a real phoenix. My literary friend, Brother Wu Jiren, once gave me two phoenix chicks last year, cherishing them like precious jewels. Who knew that after only a few months, they would break out of their cage and fly away. In regret, I wrote poems to express my sorrow. The white copper round cage where they were kept has remained empty to this day, as it is not easy to acquire such birds in Wu. Recently, my old friend, Brother Jiang Baoli, came from Shanghai, bringing a pair of newborn phoenix chicks, saying that Brother Wu Jiren had spent a great deal of money to acquire them as a gift, entrusting him to pass them on. His deep affection is beyond words! Thus, I wrote three quatrains to express my feelings: "Separated by heaven and earth, we are bitterly apart, my mourning for the phoenix is improper in every way; who knows that when the balsam blooms, the carved cage will once again see the Fenglaiyi (When the chicks arrived, the balsam flowers were blooming brightly like brocade)." "Not a fish, yet knowing the fish's joy, heaven blesses the fortunate with youthful happiness (Brother Jiren is fond of raising goldfish, finding endless joy in it). The pair of phoenixes, bestowed from afar, are exceptionally lovely, their graceful bodies and abundant feathers resembling the blue sky (The phoenix feathers are exquisitely beautiful, the color of the blue sky)." "Old grievances of the past are like spring grass, growing day and night, impossible to eradicate; the affectionate bird is capable of comforting me, no need to dream of flying to Lingyan (My late wife is buried in the Xiugu Cemetery of Lingyan)."

### 

Songli Middle School relies on tuition fees to maintain its operations, so it is inevitable that student fees must be increased from time to time to avoid losses. To seek surplus is also not against human nature. Running and providing education should also consider everyone's livelihood, and is not the same as charity. Frankly speaking, the necessity of increasing tuition fees according to the cost of living index is similar in nature to merchants increasing the price of goods slightly according to market conditions. The anxiety of poor students who are unable to pay tuition fees, however, is similar to the worries of ordinary households who are troubled by high prices and difficult living.

Merchants increase prices at any time, and all goods are expensive, exceeding the purchasing power of most people, resulting in economic depression. Private schools increase their fees, exceeding the ability of most students to pay, resulting in fewer applicants, more dropouts, and deserted gates. In contrast, the summer entrance examinations for national and municipal primary and secondary schools are extremely crowded, with ten times more applicants than positions available. Private schools fear that applicants will not be brave enough to apply, while public schools fear that there will be too many applicants, making it difficult to cope even with strong efforts. The list of those who fail is long, and they cannot help but lament, "Where can we find thousands upon thousands of spacious rooms?" The education of the next generation of citizens is truly unthinkable.

This is only the case in the old capital. And the "difficult births" of the Northeast are also coming with "refugees" in a continuous stream. As a result, vacant rooms inside and outside the nine gates are either temporary schools or refugee shelters. This situation is quite similar to the aftermath of the "September 18th" Incident. However, during the "September 18th" Incident, the Northeast was completely occupied by the enemy, and the people were unwilling to be slaves in puppet cities, fleeing to Pingjin. Now, Changguan is still under the control of the National Army, and the entire area is under the governance of our country. If it is said that the cities of Liaoning and Shenyang are already "isolated islands," then why is the old capital not surrounded by enemies on all sides? Moreover, Shanxi has also moved its schools to Ping, and several batches of Western "difficult births" have arrived by air, indicating that all parties recognize this place as a "land of happiness." However, whether there is actually enough space to provide shelter for all those who come from all directions, or whether it will increase the burden here, can be understood by observing the general situation and records, without the need for lengthy explanations. The more people who come from all directions, the more "floating capital" comes with them. The old saying goes, "When people prosper, wealth prospers," which seems to apply to present-day Beiping. During the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, this place was the capital, with people from all provinces gathering here, and remittances pouring in, making the market prosperous. This was because the money at that time was "money," not "paper." Real money and goods could make industry and commerce flourish, and blood circulation flow smoothly, while "paper" currency and floating capital would only make prices soar and resources become more scarce. In the past, the old capital had five railways extending in all directions, and goods from land and water were all flowing. Now, the old capital has many obstacles to transportation, and scarce resources. Large denominations of paper money must constantly increase their circulation, so the result is the opposite.

The problem of housing for refugees coming to Ping is more manageable than the problem of food, simply because although "things" are not "abundant," "land" is still "large." Some large altars, large courtyards, large temples, such as the Guozijian inside Andingmen, the Baiyunguan outside Xibianmen, and the Temple of Heaven inside Yongdingmen, have all become shelters.

The Guozijian is the ancient "Imperial College," with the most solemn Confucius temple in the country, the lecture halls of the Chancellor, Vice Chancellor, Doctoral Instructors, and Assistant Instructors, and the classrooms of various students. Its vast and deep courtyards are now occupied by thousands of refugees. In the hot weather, the air is filled with the stench of sweat, and outbreaks of epidemics have already been discovered. The Baiyunguan is the "Fairyland" left behind by Qiu Chuji, the so-called Changchun Zhenren. The temple is very large, with many courtyards and many gods. Its incense was at its peak during the late Qing Dynasty, and its grandeur was unparalleled. Now, it is in a state of desolation. After the arson case of the old Daoist, its appearance has changed even more. Using it as a "shelter" can be considered making use of waste. The Temple of Heaven is where the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties performed sacrifices to heaven. Its scale is vast and its architecture is exquisite. It is now used as barracks for some large troops, and the situation inside is indescribable.
