### National Assembly Elects Presidium - Process Goes Well - Hong Lanyou's Request for Punishment is Not Considered

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 5th] The sixth preparatory meeting of the National Assembly was held at 9:40 AM on the 5th, attended by 2,080 representatives. Mo Dehui served as temporary chairman and read the memorandum from Secretary-General Hong Lanyou requesting punishment for electoral misconduct. The content briefly stated: "During the proceedings of the fifth preparatory meeting, due to improper distribution of ballots by the meeting staff, some were unable to obtain ballots. In the candidate roster, the names of representatives were omitted due to erroneous explanations by the staff. Lanyou failed to supervise effectively and is undeniably at fault. In addition to severely punishing the meeting staff, I request severe punishment from the assembly to clarify responsibility." After reading, Mo stated: "Secretary-General Hong has worked diligently day and night since the preparation of the assembly. Should his request for punishment be waived?" The entire assembly unanimously applauded in agreement. Subsequently, the Secretary-General announced the list of candidates and letters from candidates Mo Dehui, Chen Bulei, Lin Zigui, Wang Yizhai, Zhou Shiguang, Zhu Jingnong, Su Lianyuan, and Chen Ce, all declaring their withdrawal from candidacy. Together with the 18 individuals, including He Longzhang and Zhang Shengyi, who requested withdrawal in the previous meeting, the total reached over 30 people. In the candidate list, Dai Xingti was nominated to participate in the candidacy for the fisheries group due to Gu Zhenggang's withdrawal. Therefore, only four groups, Dalian, Hankou, Shenyang, and Xi'an, were not selected from the 67 units. In total, there were 63 candidates. For those representatives who have already announced their withdrawal from candidacy, whether they can still obtain elected status was explained by the Secretary-General according to law that their candidate status should be cancelled. However, due to the overly cursory nature of some representatives' applications, the Secretary-General specifically declared that representatives should write a formal certificate of renunciation of election after voting and submit it to the Secretariat for processing in accordance with regulations.

At 10:05, the meeting agenda proceeded to the "Re-election of the Assembly Presidium Proposal." The Secretary-General first announced that apart from representatives and meeting staff, guests and reporters should leave the venue, and the doors of the venue would be temporarily closed, suspending entry and exit, and late representatives would be temporarily delayed from entering the venue. At this time, the Secretariat's notices were posted inside the venue and at the doors of the venue, explaining the situation. Subsequently, someone proposed that late representatives should be allowed to enter the venue. It was decided to open one door to allow entry. Representative Pan Gongzhan also suggested that this door should also be allowed for entry, and no one should leave the door before the voting procedure is completed. At 10:25, the Secretary-General announced the number of people in attendance and explained that the ballot papers for the re-election were different from the previous ballot papers to avoid errors. The voting and ballot-counting supervisors were asked to assume their duties, and the venue was divided into twelve areas (eight areas downstairs and four areas upstairs). The venue staff were responsible for distributing ballots in each area. Ballot distribution began at 10:30. Due to the continued arrival of people after the meeting, the number of attendees reached 2,269 by the time of voting, and a total of 2,269 ballots were issued. At 11:55, the representatives left the venue after voting according to the district method. Due to the secret deployment in advance, there may have been delays in time, but the order and procedures were orderly.

### Yu Youren Receives the Most Votes - Becomes the First Person Elected

The ballot counting process also went well. At that time, all supervisors were present to monitor the ballot counting by the meeting staff. The supervisors publicly nominated Liu Jiwen as the chief supervisor. Secretary-General Hong Lanyou was also present to assist. After the ballot boxes were moved from the meeting venue to the ballot counting area, each ballot box was unsealed by two supervisors, who first checked the number of ballots and reported to the chief supervisor. Then the ballots were divided into six groups, and the chief ballot distributor distributed them to the group leaders, who then distributed them to the ballot distributors in each group. Each tally clerk was responsible for counting five candidates. There were a total of twelve ballot boxes, which were processed in two groups. Invalid ballots were discarded. The counting was completed at 2:20 PM. Yu Youren, with the most votes of 55, became the first person elected as Chairman of the Presidium.

### Signing Elected National Representatives - Will First Attend the Assembly

Proposed Solution Submitted to the Chairman

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 5th] The solution to the problem of signing representatives has been drafted after research by Mo Dehui, Hu Shi, Yu Bin, and Chen Lifu, and has been submitted to the Chairman by Chen Lifu. It is reported that this plan is for Chairman Jiang to request the National Assembly Presidium in the name of the Chairman to allow the signing representatives to attend, and then the Assembly will decide on the formal attendance method, which will be submitted for discussion at the official National Assembly. On the 5th, all eight fasting representatives were injected with glucose by Dr. Hua Shujun and slightly consumed milk.

### National Assembly Proceedings - Finally Emerge After a Thousand Calls

Special Report from Our Newspaper (April 5th, Nanjing)

At precisely 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th, at the resumed sixth preparatory meeting of the National Assembly, Mr. Liu (Dehui) announced: "The elected representatives of the Presidium will take office immediately." This was followed by loud applause. Then, Secretary-General Hong called out the names one by one. Amidst the waves of applause, the chairpersons took the stage one after another, yielding and smiling. A golden-lettered red ribbon was added to their chests, and they lined up in two rows in front of the chairman's desk. Mr. Liu then flashed out from the crowd, stepped to the podium, and calmly said: "The mission of the temporary chairman and temporary secretary-general is over, we can adjourn the meeting." The Presidium, after a thousand calls, was finally produced, and the National Assembly can now move into the formal agenda.

The National Assembly held six preparatory meetings, five of which were argued for the election of the Presidium. Later, the organizational law was amended, the number of people was increased, and the election method was amended. By the fifth preparatory meeting on the 3rd, it seemed that nine out of ten ballots had been cast. Unexpectedly, due to two technical problems, the first election was invalidated, and it was delayed for another two nights. The first technical problem was that the name of He Zhonghan was missing from the candidate names printed on the ballot. It turned out that Mr. Zhao Hengti, the convener of the Hunan unit, forgot to send the candidate nomination and recommendation letter to the Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee, causing Hong Lanyou to be unjustly scolded. It was not until the evening of the 4th that Mr. Zhao found the recommendation letter, and the problem was solved, and the misunderstanding disappeared. The Hunan representatives felt apologetic. The second problem was that the ballots were in short supply due to the chaos in the order. This and the previous problem made the meeting on the 3rd a mess, and the meeting on the 5th was therefore even more tense.

Walking into the venue on the morning of the 5th, one could see twelve ballot boxes neatly arranged at the end of the chairman's table, which were the invalid ballots from the 3rd. The meeting staff controlled an unprecedented pile of meeting agendas, distributing them to the representatives who forgot to collect them when entering the venue, because the agenda contained the list of all candidates. After Mr. Mo Liu read Hong Lanyou's document requesting punishment for "ineffective supervision" on the 3rd, he added: "Everyone is responsible for what happened on the 3rd." He pleaded for Hong to be excused from punishment. Hong Lanyou more painstakingly read the list of candidates. Then the Fisheries Association nominated Dai Xingti as a unit candidate to fill the vacancy left by Gu Zhenggang. Mo Dehui, Chen Bulei, Chen Ce and other nineteen candidates successively gave up their election.

At exactly 10:00 AM, Hong Lanyou once again followed the method of previous years, inviting guests, reporters, translators, attendants, and all non-official members of the assembly to leave, and late representatives were temporarily locked outside the door. Withdrew together were the twelve invalid ballot boxes on the rostrum, and twelve new ballot boxes had already been placed at the exit of the venue.

Hong Lanyou had now become a commander who was determined to win. He divided the entire venue into twelve "major defense zones," four upstairs and eight downstairs. In each "major defense zone," there were many small grids divided into four rows, and representatives designated as voting supervisors were assigned two people in each "major defense zone" to "supervise the battle." There were designated personnel responsible for both the small grids and major areas, which was entirely a "mechanized" system.

After about three quarters of an hour, everything was arranged. Hong gave the order.

"The meeting staff issuing ballots, listen to my report and issue the ballots together!"

"If the ballot boxes are blocking the way, move them away!"

"Representatives, please do not leave your seats immediately after the election!"

The meeting staff, as if facing a formidable enemy, repeatedly checked the number of representatives in attendance, totaling 2,339. At 10:50, some representatives who were waiting anxiously were already making a little noise. Hong Lanyou gave an order and began to issue ballots at high speed. The ballots were yellow, so there was no way to confuse them with the white invalid ballots of the 3rd. Ten minutes later, the election was over.

At 11:30, the ballot boxes, which had been sealed for less than two hours, were opened again under the mercury lights and cameras. The first step was to check the ballots in six units. The supervisors took out the ballots one by one and handed them to the staff to sort them out and count them. After completing this task at high speed in twenty minutes, the supervisors Ouyang Lun, with his arms open and his face flushed, smiled and said, "My arms are really sore!" The second step was to check the invalid ballots. Among the 2,333 ballots, there were twelve questionable ballots, and after identification, five were invalid ballots. The third step was to distribute the ballots to the staff who were in charge of five candidates each for individual calculation. By 2:00 PM, all the sub-counts were completed, and then they were arranged in order of the number of votes. Among them, the same number of votes was determined by the number of strokes in the surname. Among the 195 candidates, only 129 received votes, and 66 even voted for others with their own votes. It was all in vain to find people to sign and recommend them on the morning of the 3rd.

Among the 85 elected people, the most votes were for Ziyouren and Gu Zhenggang, with 55 votes, and the least were for Gao Wei and Zhang Boling, with 11 votes.

At 3:00 PM, the Secretariat completed the roster, and the supervisors drafted the report. The task was accomplished, and everyone in the venue was hungry and exhausted, slouching in front of the dining table. Hong Lanyou couldn't even eat, and his steps were even more unsteady; only the chief supervisor, Liu Jiwen, picked up a piece of braised pork knuckle with his chopsticks and said, "I'm not nervous, so I'm not tired!" He is really a good midwife!" But a pregnant female staff member on the long chair was already leaning against the back of the chair and sleeping.

What a difficult birth of the Presidium, it finally came out after a thousand calls!

### People From All Walks of Life Firmly Express Support for President Jiang to Assume the Presidency

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 5th] After the news that President Jiang announced his unwillingness to participate in the presidential election spread, it did not seem to affect the determination of the general public to support President Jiang to assume the first presidential office. When social elites Mo Dehui held a press conference at 2:00 PM on the 5th, reporters asked him about his feelings about President Jiang's unwillingness to run for election. Mo firmly replied: "The current national situation really requires Mr. Jiang to serve as President. It can also be said that it is Mr. Jiang's inescapable duty to serve as President. Mr. Jiang's humility is a virtue of the Chinese people, but no matter what, the colleagues of the National Assembly will definitely elect Mr. Jiang as President." Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, also said when answering reporters' questions at the National Assembly Hall on the 5th: "I have decided to sign a nomination to support President Jiang's candidacy for President." Zhang Boling, president of Nankai University, told reporters on the morning of the 5th that the situation in China is so difficult that it is difficult to predict what the country will be like in the future if President Jiang is unwilling to run for President, and anyone who is President will have difficulties in the current situation, but only President Jiang can lead through this difficult situation.

Youth Party Formally Expresses Request for the President to Assume Difficult Responsibilities

[Another Cable] On the 5th, after the news that President Jiang announced his unwillingness to participate in the presidential election was reported, Zeng Qi and Chen Qitian of the Youth Party immediately inquired about the truth from Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun by telephone. Zeng and others expressed great concern after reading the report, because the party had decided to support President Jiang to serve as the President of this term. President Zhang then relayed President Jiang's sincere remarks made at the Kuomintang Provisional Central Plenary Session on the 4th, saying that the President was very firm in his intention, but people within the Kuomintang still unanimously urged the President to stand for election. Zeng and others said: "The country is in turmoil, and the future responsibilities are arduous. Apart from the President, no one can be competent. The Youth Party has long been determined to support President Jiang as the first President. The Youth Party's National Assembly representatives will participate in the nomination of President Jiang as a presidential candidate and unanimously vote to elect President Jiang." Please ask President Zhang to convey this intention to the Kuomintang Central Committee. Zhang presented the above process when he attended the emergency Central Standing Committee meeting at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th.

People From the Democratic Socialist Party Say That President Jiang Should Not Humbly Withdraw

[Our Newspaper News] Regarding President Jiang's unwillingness to participate in this presidential election, people from the Democratic Socialist Party believe that the President's concession is indeed sincere, but given the President's high prestige, if he is willing to take actual responsibility and serve as the President of the Executive Yuan, the position of President will inevitably become difficult to produce; at the same time, the President's expression the other day was only his personal opinion, and given the severity of the current situation, the Kuomintang will never let him humbly withdraw. All important officials of the Democratic Socialist Party, including Zhang Junmai, refused to make public statements on this matter, and even after the Central Standing Committee meeting, they did not intend to make any public statements on the presidential election. A member of the Standing Committee of the Party told reporters yesterday: "We believe that the presidential election should not become a matter of discussion, because it can only be the President; what is worth studying is the Vice Presidential candidate."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] All the National Assembly representatives from Guangxi held a meeting on the 5th and unanimously decided to telegraph President Jiang, supporting him to assume the office of the first President to comfort the people's expectations.

[Our Newspaper News] In order to understand the reaction of the American community to President Jiang's unwillingness to run for President, the reporter especially visited Mr. Xie Gai, President of the American Chamber of Commerce in the city. He was very cautious in his attitude and only allowed to express his personal opinion, briefly saying: "Apart from President Jiang, no one can gain the trust of the people of the country. I believe that the candidate for the future President of your country should have the strength to control the various forces in the country, and there is no need to worry about his international reputation. The leader of China only needs to be supported by the Chinese people, and whether the United States, Britain or other countries are satisfied is irrelevant." Asked whether Dr. Hu Shi would be a suitable candidate for President, he replied: "I have never met Dr. Hu, and this is a matter of your country's internal affairs. I am too ignorant of this matter to make any criticism. I personally believe that if Dr. Hu can serve as the President of the Executive Yuan, it can indicate a major step in China's internal reform." The reporter asked again, if the President insists on not running for President, who would be a more ideal candidate to stand for election? He replied: "We believe that Mr. Song Ziwen is quite capable, but we do not know what his reputation is in the country."

[United Press, Washington, 4th] U.S. officials here today are awaiting accurate factual evidence regarding President Jiang's abandonment of his presidential candidacy. Well-informed sources say that the U.S. government believes that the so-called President Jiang's unwillingness to be re-elected under China's new constitution is "impossible at present."

Essay

### Appeasement and Flattery

— Wang Pingling

Recently, after reading the articles of some experts, it is really ridiculous, such as Mr. He Yongji's "A Chat Over Wine," which is one example. I have been troubled by the bizarre theories secreted from the minds of this kind of experts. Although I want to "ignore them accordingly," I always feel like there is a fishbone in my throat, and I have to spit it out to feel better.

According to Mr. He's statement, the Chinese Communist Party is originally a traditional "local product" of China, and there is no so-called "Marxism-Leninism," with very little international flavor. At most, it is just a "peasant uprising" in the style of the Bronze Horse and the Red Eyebrows... If the United States lends money to China to help China "suppress the rebellion," it will force the "local" CCP to turn to the Soviet Union and accelerate the arrival of the Third World War. This is really obliterating the facts and dreaming with open eyes. Except for Mr. Wallace, who regards it as a confidant and listens with relish, I believe that as long as Americans who understand the situation slightly, at most they will just smile it off! Mr. He underestimates the CCP and looks down on the CCP. He really does not understand the CCP!

Mr. He also believes that as long as Wallace regains the power of the United States, the disputes between the United States and the Soviet Union can be easily resolved. What is his magic weapon for solving it? According to the results of their discussion that night, it is probably to first rely on Mr. Wallace's personality to guarantee and gain the trust of the other party, and then take the lead in thoroughly removing the United States' national defense. If appeasement is not enough, then continue with flattery, and achieve the United States' disguised "unconditional surrender," then big things can be turned into small things, and small things can be turned into nothing. However, whether Americans are willing to let Mr. Wallace use the United States, which has been painstakingly managed by countless patriots and benevolent people since Washington founded the country, as a tool to test his ambitions is a question. Even if Wallace really has such a day to express the policy of "appeasement and flattery" to the extent that he is satisfied, whether he can win the satisfaction of the other party is still uncertain!

To be honest, the postwar world is devastated, and who does not desire construction. The people who are alive at this moment have already tasted the taste of war, and who does not pray for peace. However, to strive for construction and peace, if the stupid method of "appeasement and flattery" is adopted, the most basic condition is that one party must be willing to sacrifice endlessly, and the other party's desire can be stopped appropriately; one party must be willing to make a big step back, and the other party's pace must stop at a stage that is considered satisfactory, and decide not to "take an inch after gaining an inch." Is this possible in the purely "stake-related" interaction between countries? Even if one party is willing to back down, who can guarantee that the other party can know when to be satisfied? If they can never be satisfied, what reliable good policies can reduce the other party's desires?

When World War I ended, the British were indeed able to maintain their traditional "gentlemanly demeanor" and first fulfill the resolutions of the "Naval Reduction Conference" and implement the "doctrine of appeasement" by taking the lead; but Hitler accepted the British appeasement and increasingly expanded his ambitions for aggression. On the eve of World War II, Chamberlain already knew the ineffectiveness of "appeasement." Not only did he not condescend to Munich to flatter, who knew that the more respectful and sincere the attitude of flattery, the faster and more thoroughly the powder keg of World War II would explode. Yin Jian is not far away, and the past can be learned. In today's society where humanity is declining and silence is rampant, if there is not enough hard power to stop the impulsive bestiality, it is impossible to imagine how terrible the holocaust of mankind will evolve. The heartbreaking and shocking tragedy played in human history really makes me doubt Mencius's theory of inherent goodness. Seeing the roundaboutness but not being relevant to the matter, I have to admit that Xunzi and Hobbes's advocacy of the theory of "inherent evil" is closer to the truth of reality. According to Hobbes's philosophy, the so-called human kindness and international peace are essentially the result of mutual use and equal strength. People's efforts are to extend the peaceful situation, under the precarious cliff that is constantly trembling and always in danger of breaking, intermittently. As long as one party's strength is slightly different and cannot stabilize the balanced scale, it can affect the whole body and destroy the entire system and order. At that time, all calls for benevolence, justice, and morality have become nonsense and cannot save the holocaust of mankind. Hobbes ruthlessly pointed out that human nature has this weakness that leads to destruction, which naturally makes people tremble and fear; but in general, the pitiful lambs, in order to escape destruction, bow down to the man-eating tigers and flatter them in every possible way, wagging their tails and begging for mercy. How stupid is this? Wells, in his book "The Shape of Things to Come," once said: "The penguins that became extinct in the modern animal kingdom did so because they did not dare to face the cruelty of the enemy and save themselves as a group; but when their brothers were swallowed by giant beasts or raptors, they chanted beautiful songs on the beach, opened their beautiful wings, danced and sang, and exhausted their talents to entertain the enemies who slaughtered their brothers, hoping not to eat themselves. As a result, after eating their brothers, they ate themselves, and were finally eaten up. There were no survivors, and it was only reduced to a term in zoology." I never thought that today some experts who consider themselves wise have their wisdom even below that of extinct penguins!

If the world sincerely wants to avoid the possible catastrophe, it must no longer use the stupid method of "appeasement and flattery" to create the form of "man-made knives and saws, and I am the fish and meat." It is only possible to overcome all its own weaknesses as much as possible, so that the other party is impeccable and absolutely cannot find the weakest link. Only in this way can everyone find a gap for self-reflection in the dilemma of persisting without decision and falling into a stalemate, recall the lost humanity, and then from the perspective of interests, know yourself and the other party, weigh the pros and cons, even when it is unbearable, they still dare not compete, and if they want to compete, they will die together. Extending it to the point where each other is exhausted and disheartened, the mood of mankind has changed from unusual to normal, and from tension to relaxation. Perhaps they can say with an understanding heart and a smile, "Forget it, forget it." Then, they will be willing to settle down and find another rational solution.

The current situation is as if the various planets of the nebula have just formed and have not yet stepped on the orbits of non-interference and balanced attraction. From war to victory, it takes eight years, then from victory to peace, it may take twice as long to achieve it. Today, the opposition between two very different ideas and ways of life can be regarded as the misfortune of mankind, but it is not the "preservative" of mankind. As long as it is used well and the balance of the scales is kept stable, not only is there no danger, it is very likely to be used as an element to promote human progress. But if one party intends to use the stupid method of "appeasement and flattery" and sell feelings for peace, then it is undoubtedly opening up weaknesses and giving others an opportunity to take advantage of. Since people have knives and saws in their hands, why not slaughter fish and meat to enrich themselves!

### On the Jinghan Railway

— Our Central China War Zone Correspondent, Bu Mian

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 4th] This is already the season when the earth returns to spring, but the weather has suddenly turned cold in recent days, and the spring rains have indeed shattered people's long-awaited "dream of spring." People have temporarily shrunk back into an atmosphere like the remnants of winter, and spring seems even more distant. The reporter stayed in Nanjing for six days, and it was either cloudy or rainy. There was only one complete sunny day, and that was on the day of the Yellow Flower Mound Martyrs' Memorial Day, which was also the day the National Assembly opened. The blue sky presented its original smile, bringing a ray of sunshine, and at the same time, a warm-hearted welcoming song of spring to the lips of spring tourists who were in groups.

Small Scenes of Wuhu

Wuhu is the first stop on the Jinghan Railway. The reporter stayed here for one night. Finally, the ship arrived slowly, but it was already 11 p.m. when it arrived in Wuhu. In the anemic electric light, only a vague outline of the city could be seen. The prices of daily necessities are lower than in Nanjing and Shanghai. First-class machine rice is 3.25 million per dan, the best flour is 1.76 million per dan, pork is 60,000 per jin, beef is 40,000 per jin, chicken eggs are 5,000 each, and cabbage or spinach is 5-6,000 per jin. There are six or seven entertainment venues, including three cinemas, mostly showing domestic films that have already been shown in Shanghai, such as "The Black-Clad Girl," "Remembering Jiangnan," and "Talented Men and Beautiful Women." Tickets are not expensive, 20,000 per ticket. One cinema offered preferential treatment to the audience on the "March 29th" Memorial Day, selling tickets for only 13,000. Peking opera theaters are all located in tea houses, where you can drink tea and listen to opera. Only the Guangdong Restaurant has two singers, who can be considered Wuhu's only "singing orioles," broadcasting Shanghai songs there. Although there are several newspapers, their circulation is very poor, and the price is particularly high, selling for 10,000 per sheet, and twice as expensive on the ship. One newspaper, the Fuxing Daily, has a unique layout, which is rare even in the whole country. It places the supplement in the lower right corner of the first page, occupying a quarter of the space, with the remaining three-quarters being advertisements. I dare not assert whether this is due to the small size of the newspaper or the way it is laid out. Anqing is the second stop. The ship did not stop, but only a glimpse of the capital city of Anhui was taken in a hurry.

A Quick Look at Jiujiang

Although the ship only stopped in Jiujiang for 90 minutes, fortunately the daylight helped a lot, allowing me to see it in a short hour and a half. Stepping onto the streets of Jiujiang, I was reminded of the Nanshi district of Shanghai. Apart from a few roads being neater and wider than Nanshi, everything else is not as prosperous as Nanshi. There are no cars to be seen on the roads, and even rickshaws are few and far between. The shops selling porcelain are the most numerous, and their business is also very slow. Only some transit passengers from Nanjing and Shanghai to Yuehan patronize them, but after all, they are limited. Every shop has its doors open on the outside, but in reality, it is no different from being "closed." There is only one theater in the whole city, the Rongyu Peking Opera Theater. Although the tickets are not expensive, the audience is not crowded. There is only one small newspaper, which maintains publication using wartime cooked paper due to the high cost of paper, and the price is equal to that of major newspapers in Shanghai. Prices are lower than in Wuhu. Machine rice is 2.9 million per dan. A plate of stir-fried shredded pork is twice as large as in Nanjing and Shanghai, and sells for only 80,000. A bowl of noodles only costs 20,000. Porcelain is not cheap, which is unexpected. A small teapot costs at least 160,000, and there are even more expensive ones. Taking a quick look at Jiujiang, what I saw in that instant may have been the outer layer of the outer layer of Jiujiang.

The journey on the Jinghan Railway usually takes three days, but this time it was delayed due to fog, exceeding the scheduled voyage by one day. After four days of tedious life on the ship, I gradually recovered from the tedium and fatigue and stepped onto the land of Hankou.

### Offering Remote Sacrifices to the Yellow Emperor and Lu Xiufu

— Zhang Zhaorong

The Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum is located in the central part of Shaanxi County, now renamed Huangling County. The mausoleum is located where the mountain is uplifted and water surrounds it, shaped like a bridge, hence the name Qiaoling. Sima Qian's Historical Records says: "The Yellow Emperor collapsed and was buried in Qiaoshan", referring to today's Qiaoling. Qiaoling Mountain is towering, with thousands of mountains surrounding it, magnificent in scale, and dotted with ancient cypresses, making the scenery particularly beautiful. In front of the Xuanyuan Temple, there is an ancient cypress tree that can be embraced by seven people, said to be planted by the Yellow Emperor himself. Emperor Wu of Han sought immortality and once built a platform here. To this day, there is a cypress tree with numerous nail marks, said to be the tree that Emperor Wu hung his clothes on. In front of the mausoleum is a stele with the words "Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum" personally inscribed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the handwriting is elegant. Huangling is not only a historical site but also a scenic spot. In order to honor the virtues of our ancestors, the central government usually sends senior officials every year to pay homage to the mausoleum. This year, due to the impact of war and transportation, we can only offer remote sacrifices in Xi'an. Thinking of this, I can't help but feel emotional.

The Yellow Emperor is the ancestor of our nation. He created writing, made boats and armies, created crowns and robes, managed utensils, built palaces, minted currency, invented silk, wrote medical scriptures, set laws and rules, divided and appointed officials, and established the nation. His contribution to the cultural survival of the Chinese nation is of great merit and can be verified in history. Even after becoming the emperor, "when the world was not obedient, the Yellow Emperor followed and conquered it, pacified it, opened mountains and roads, and never lived in peace. He went east to the sea, climbed Wanshan Mountain, and reached Daitong, west to Kongtong, climbed Jitou, south to the Jiang River, climbed Xiongxiang, and north to drive away the Hunzhu, and united the symbols in Fushan." His career was extremely prosperous, so later generations all regarded themselves as his descendants, so as not to forget the virtues of their ancestors.

Last year, on Qingming Festival, I accompanied Inspector Tian Jiongjin, Mayor Wang Youzhen, Director Jiang Jianren, and others to worship there. After the worship, I had a conversation with the gentlemen about the Huangling construction plan, because the central government had instructed the Shaanxi Provincial Government to prepare construction opinions, and Director Jiang was consulting on this matter. In my opinion, the scale of Huangling's construction should be larger than that of Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, and its scenery should be better than that of Tan Mu, because the Yellow Emperor's achievements are no less than those of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and it is appropriate to have a national and international building for the admiration of future generations, and to show the long history and broad culture of our nation to friendly countries. The mountains and rivers in the area are beautiful, and with artificial arrangements, it can naturally be far better than the tomb road of Mr. Tan Zu'an. As for the construction plan, I suggest that professors and colleagues from the civil engineering, water conservancy, mechanical, electrical, and mining departments of the Northwest Institute of Technology form an inspection team to figure out how to achieve architectural grandeur, how to use nearby rivers to build reservoirs and fountains to enhance the beauty, how to extend the steel road to Yan'an to facilitate transportation, and how to develop nearby mineral resources and establish industries to prosper Shaanxi Province. All of these require careful planning by experts, and the raising of funds is also an important issue. In my opinion, the descendants of Yan and Huang will all be happy to donate to build the ancestral mausoleum. Therefore, once it is called for, the source of funds will be very easy to obtain. If each person bears an average of 10,000 yuan, the amount collected by 450 million compatriots at home and abroad will be considerable. However, this matter must be initiated by the central government and followed by various places, and technical issues should also be paid attention to. Once the mausoleum is completed, representatives should be sent from each province to pay homage every Qingming Festival, and international figures are also welcome to participate. A university should also be established near the park to commemorate it. If this can be done, the future development will be unlimited.

Not long ago, the Luochuan War broke out, and Huangling was also heard to have been occupied. The Communist Party is doing everything possible to destroy our country's inherent culture. The location of the mausoleum must be ominous. I am saddened by this! Huangling is a holy place, and it must not be allowed to be destroyed or damaged by bandits. Our army is now gathered in Xi'an and should be recovered as soon as possible, so as not to let down the spirits of our ancestors in heaven.

In the past, the Yellow Emperor cultivated virtue and invigorated the army, managed the five qi, cultivated the five grains, comforted the people, measured the four directions, taught the abilities of bears, panthers, tigers, and Pi Xiu, conquered enemies, and laid the foundation for the survival of future generations. Today, the survival of the nation is in peril. Internal strife must be quelled quickly, and the people must be allowed to recuperate and rest, promote the entrepreneurial spirit of our ancestors, cultivate civilization, train the three armies, and complete the pacification of the chaos as soon as possible. This is an urgent task.

History says that "in the Yellow Emperor's time, people did not die young, officials were not selfish, markets did not speculate, cities were not closed, and villages had no thieves. People yielded wealth to each other, the wind and rain were timely, the five grains were harvested, and the distant countries of barbarians all offered their tributes." Looking at the world today, people are dying one after another, corruption is rampant, thieves are rising, the government and the public are only competing for profit, and the international status is plummeting. How can we face them? Therefore, we must work hard to govern the country, and the rulers must take the lead in advocating the governance of the Yellow Emperor's prosperous era as the goal of future efforts.

The 5th is the National Tomb Sweeping Day, offering remote sacrifices to Huangling, and all kinds of feelings are intertwined. I therefore dipped my brush in ink to express my sentiments.

### Strengthening Military and Police Forces to Ensure Public Security; France and Italy Adopt Emergency Measures; Anti-Communist Elements in Rome March and Demonstrate

[United Press, Rome, 5th] The Italian government held a grand parade of 20,000 police officers and soldiers yesterday, watched by 500,000 people. This event, taking place seven days before the general election, was clearly intended to demonstrate force to the Communist Party. This was the largest parade since Mussolini's demonstration to Hitler in 1936. The previous parade was a diplomatic maneuver, while this parade was a public display of the army's support for Prime Minister Gasperi. Many important officials from the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Britain, France, and the United States attended and reviewed the parade. At the same time, the Secretary-General of the Italian Communist Party, Duggati, claimed that hundreds of thousands of voters in southern Italy, traditionally anti-communist, will cast their votes for the left-wing front, which will determine the political direction of the country.

[United Press, Gorizia, 4th] More than 4,000 Italian anti-communists dispersed a planned Communist rally in the Santo Antonio Square today, then staged their own demonstration, singing the national anthem. The crowd then advanced from the square towards the Yugoslav border, where they were intercepted and dispersed by a large contingent of riot police, without any brawls or bloodshed. At the same time, anti-communists in Rome staged armed parades in the city center in response to the Communist Party's show of force. As the election date approaches, candidates from various parties are addressing voters in every town and village throughout the country.

[Reuters, Paris, 4th] Officials here announced that France is organizing 50 companies of the Republican Security Force to assist the police in maintaining national security and order, and to protect the country's airfields, ports, railways, and borders. These security forces are commanded by a general headquarters, which is divided into nine command posts. It is generally believed that this move by the government is to prevent the Communist Party from launching strikes this summer.

[Reuters, Paris, 4th] Interior Minister Moch gave a speech in Sete on the Mediterranean coast today, warning the Communists that if they launch strikes again, the government will deal with them with strong measures. He pointed out that the strikes in November and December of last year were launched by the Communist Party on the orders of the Communist Information Bureau. Recently, social activities have also occurred simultaneously in France and northern Italy, often supported by foreigners participating in the Soviet Overseas Chinese Association, the French Polish Workers' Party, and the Free Italian Movement. Although France is still willing to accept every foreigner who wishes to come to work, France requires them not to interfere in France's internal affairs and to allow the French to resolve their disputes themselves. The French have learned a lesson in November and December of last year and are now better prepared and organized and will be able to smoothly protect the order of the Republic.

### The Situation in Berlin is Easing; Britain and the United States Agree to Negotiate Traffic Control Issues; The Four Allied Military Commanders Will Hold a Banquet Tonight

[United Press, Berlin, 5th] The tense situation caused by the Soviet "blockade" of Berlin is easing as Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky accepts an invitation from British Commander-in-Chief Robertson. At this banquet, it may be possible to resolve all issues over a glass of wine, although most people remain pessimistic. Robertson invited Sokolovsky to dinner on Tuesday, with British Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery as a distinguished guest. It is expected that US Commander-in-Chief General Clay and French Commander-in-Chief Juniich will also attend.

[United Press, Berlin, 5th] The Allied military authorities today accepted the Soviet Union's proposal to negotiate land traffic control issues and advocated convening a four-power conference of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to discuss the matter. If the Soviet Union agrees, this will be the first meeting of the four powers on German control since the Soviet Union withdrew from the Allied Control Council on the 20th of last month. At the same time, although all passenger trains are still suspended today, freight trains are now entering Berlin.

[United Press, Berlin, 4th] US Chief of Staff Gai Lai and Soviet Deputy Commander Tratewen exchanged notes today, agreeing to immediately negotiate the Soviet land traffic control issue. At the same time, the US military authorities ordered the suspension of food airlift to Berlin. The emergency situation in Berlin for the past two weeks has thus eased slightly. The Soviet side also presented the same note to Britain and France, but Britain and France have not yet responded. Tratewen also said that he would try to alleviate some of the difficulties in passenger and freight transportation, but insisted that the current control regulations could not be changed. Gai replied that he was willing to discuss the matter, but it was difficult to accept the Soviet army's boarding and inspection of trains in its occupation zone. The Soviet note denied the existence of any agreement allowing Western countries free use of the highways and railways between its occupation zone and Berlin, claiming that due to the lack of traffic control, unscrupulous elements took the opportunity to engage in various speculation and illegal activities, resulting in numerous crimes in the Soviet occupation zone. Western countries are not overly optimistic about the Soviet Union's proposal to hold negotiations. It is the first time since the 4th that there have been no US, British, or French troops stationed at the highway checkpoints here. Only the highway to Yuhauno, and one single-track railway between Berlin and West Germany are still checked by Soviet troops.

### A British Plane Collides with a Soviet Plane over Berlin; Fourteen Passengers Die

[United Press, Berlin, 5th] A British airliner flying from Hamburg to Berlin collided with a Soviet fighter plane over the border between the Soviet zone and the British zone of Berlin on the afternoon of the 5th. The cause is unknown. There were four crew members and ten passengers on board, and it is feared that none survived. The passenger list included Guo Liya, a reporter for the United Press of Great Britain. British Air Force personnel have gone to the crash site to investigate.

### Soviet Officer Dies of Electrocution

[Reuters, Berlin, 5th] Police revealed: The body of a Soviet officer was found on the railway tracks outside Itter Station in the British zone of Berlin. Police initially said he died from gunshot wounds, but then said there were no injuries and that he probably died from electrocution.

### British Defense Minister Declares Willingness to Work for Peace

[Reuters, London, 4th] Defense Minister Alexander said in a speech in Selma Noch that Britain's preparations are to work for peace and are unlimited, but we cannot lie down to be trampled on by others. Although the situation in Germany is worrying, the fact that we have gathered with the Soviet Union, Poland, and the South, or tried to establish trade agreements, shows our goodwill. The British government or Bevin cannot be blamed for our country's reaching the current situation.

### US Mediterranean Fleet to Conduct Combat Exercises

[Reuters, London, 4th] US Naval Headquarters here announced that the US Navy's mobile unit, which was recently in the Persian Gulf, has passed through the Suez Canal under the command of Major General Martin and entered the Mediterranean Sea, where it will conduct technical exercises. The flagship of the mobile unit is the 27,000-ton aircraft carrier "Fochi Valley." This mobile unit will join the US Mediterranean Fleet under the command of Lieutenant General Xie Shouzhong to conduct routine technical exercises. Admiral Connolly, Commander-in-Chief of the US Navy in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, left London today for a port in Greece, where he will board a cruiser for inspection and hold talks with the commanders of the US fleets in the Mediterranean, Middle East, and Northern Europe.

### Truman Will Request Congress To Reinstate Military Lend-Lease Act; Regent Of Belgium Leads Delegation To US For Visit

[United Press International, Washington, 4th] Some senators believe that President Truman will request Congress to support the Five-Power Mutual Assistance Treaty of Belgium with American guns and other military supplies. Senator Vandenberg, with the support of his friends, believes that the important plan President Truman will next present to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is the Military Lend-Lease Act.

[United Press International, Washington, 4th] President Truman's decision on whether to back economic aid to Western Europe with military aid will be made soon. Belgian Prime Minister Spaak's arrival here may contribute to this decision. It has been repeatedly rumored here that Spaak will discuss the military aspects of the aid to Europe plan with the authorities. Spaak is accompanying a delegation led by the Regent of Belgium, Charles, which includes the Minister of Economic Affairs, Groetaers. Groetaers will likely plan Belgium's role in the aid to Europe plan.

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] Less than four hours after President Truman signed the foreign aid bill, State Department officials declared that the department would begin ordering the materials needed for foreign aid within the week, and the first batch of goods could be shipped soon. The temporary agency established by the State Department to manage foreign aid can start work on Monday. It is reported that of the $3.8 billion in aid to the sixteen European countries in the first year under the Marshall Plan, the majority will be relief materials such as food, fuel, and fertilizer, and the remaining $1.5 billion will be constructive materials such as equipment and raw materials.

### Major Riot Erupts In Egypt; Public Aids Police In Demonstrations; Situation In Alexandria Is Chaotic; Troops Open Fire, Over 100 Casualties

[Reuters, Cairo, 4th] Striking police and demonstrating crowds in Alexandria clashed with troops, exchanging gunfire. The situation in the city is chaotic, with fires burning in several places, and arson and looting rampant. Army tanks are patrolling, and Prime Minister Nokrashy has personally flown to the city by special plane to supervise the army's suppression efforts. The police are on strike demanding higher pay. Thousands of officers and constables throughout the city are participating in the work slowdown. Sympathetic citizens have responded to the police strike. Four hundred police officers in Cairo were the first to go on strike, followed by constables. Army troops and tanks were deployed on the streets an hour before the strike began to prevent incidents. According to Alexandria Police Chief General Asim, sympathetic citizens and students attacked the police station on Mohammed Square, the city's main thoroughfare, with stones, breaking many windows. Troops stationed in a nearby ten-story building were ordered to open fire for the first time. The demonstrating crowds suffered casualties and retreated. The incident gradually escalated. Some striking police officers who had not handed in their weapons opened fire on the troops, leading to clashes in several locations. Troublemakers took the opportunity to commit arson. Four movie theaters and many other buildings caught fire, and black smoke enveloped the entire city. Army vehicles, including tanks and jeeps, sped through the city, instructing citizens to take cover or face being shot. It is rumored that a tank was seized by the crowd and driven towards the port. Middle and high school students were among the demonstrators, shouting "Down with the government" and "Down with Nokrashy." All public institutions are now guarded by troops. The riots are gradually spreading to the suburbs, and two textile and cigarette factories have been set on fire.

[Reuters, Cairo, 5th] The Egyptian army in Alexandria fired machine guns into the air to disperse the demonstrators. The death toll has been determined to be 15, with nearly 100 injured. Before leaving Cairo for Alexandria, Prime Minister Nokrashy instructed the police to return to their posts before it was "too late," and that the government would consider their demands for higher pay.

[Reuters, Bogota, 4th] Venezuelan representative Betancourt suggested to the Pan-American Conference today that referendums be held in all disputed territories in the Western Hemisphere to allow residents to decide their future. He believes that all foreign colonies in the Western Hemisphere should be abolished in accordance with the spirit of the Atlantic Charter. It is reported that Betancourt has received a formal request from ethnic movement groups in British, French, and Dutch Guiana, asking him to advocate for the independence of Guiana on their behalf.

[United Press International, Bogota, 4th] Argentine Foreign Minister Paz explicitly stated on the 4th that Argentina would oppose the adoption of a harsh anti-communist resolution at the Pan-American Conference being held here, but he also stated that the Argentine government would take action to prevent foreign subversion from infiltrating the Western Hemisphere. He hopes that the Pan-American Conference will adopt the "Third Position" proposed by Argentine President Peron.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] Under the excessively lenient U.S. policy towards Japan, the Japanese government is gradually revealing its true colors. Recently, sources close to the government announced that the government has decided to organize a "Maritime Security Agency" similar to the Navy Department starting on May 1st. To temporarily avoid international criticism, it will be temporarily established within the Ministry of Transportation, and will later be expanded and reorganized to be directly under the cabinet. It is rumored that this maritime security force will have 125 special task force ships, totaling more than 50,000 tons.

### Soviet Bloc Expresses Dissatisfaction With US Leadership Position At The Conference On Freedom Of The Press; May Protest At An Appropriate Time

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 4th - United Press International] The Soviet Union and its satellite states are increasingly dissatisfied with the fact that their proposals at the International Conference on Freedom of the Press have been defeated. Poland, Bulgaria, and Romania have criticized the participating countries in committee meetings for quickly following the leadership of the United States in stipulating freedom of the press and the free flow of global news. It is generally speculated that the Soviet bloc may lodge a protest at an appropriate time. However, as divisions between Eastern and Western countries are becoming increasingly apparent in all international matters, the United States will express regret over this possible action by the Soviet Union.

(10) The Burma Pipeline Plan

The short-sightedness of the China-Burma-India Theater Command can be seen in its attitude towards the pipeline that ran through Burma.

Defenders of Stilwell seem to be justified, believing that, if nothing else, this pipeline alone proves that he was wholeheartedly committed to the significance of the Burma campaign.

In fact, the pipeline plan was conceived by the Chinese National Defense Supplies Commission, which was established in the United States a few months before the Pearl Harbor incident and was once rejected by Stilwell.

In the summer of 1941, before the Japanese occupied Burma, engineers from Shell Oil Company designed a readily portable pipeline and advocated laying it along the old Burma Road. This design was submitted to the Army Engineers in Washington, who used it, but it was not used in Burma at the time. The Japanese fully controlled the area by June 1942.

Personnel in the Theater Command did not consider the pipeline plan until the end of 1942. At the end of 1942, the Chinese National Defense Supplies Commission and Lend-Lease representatives mentioned the plan to General Hearn, the commander of Stilwell's advance echelon in Chongqing. They suggested that it be included in the Burma operation plan that Stilwell was drafting at the time. They made a formal proposal.

When the plan was presented to Stilwell, he did not approve of it. I was told that when a representative of the Chinese National Defense Supplies Commission later wanted to argue the case, he refused to discuss the matter.

Stilwell's reaction was reportedly: "I don't want any damned pipelines -- all I want are bullets, just bullets."

I believe that the pipeline plan was finally incorporated into the Burma operation plan due to the insistence of General Sherman Vael, the supply chief in Washington. This was a military necessity. Without this plan, the value of the Burma Road to China would not be as great as adding a batch of transport planes flying over the Hump.

I have always believed that the Theater Command's first priority should be to expand the air transport facilities flying over the Hump as much as possible. Even after the Burma Road and pipeline were both functioning, most of what we obtained still came from the air.

But Stilwell believed that air transport over the Hump was a competition to his Burma Road plan. Until the middle stages of his Burma operation, the work of airlifting supplies became a fairly important factor for the success of his operation. Without the airlift, including the airlift of oil pipelines, the pipeline project and other aspects of the Burma operation, including the Chinese army crossing the Nu River to launch an offensive, would have failed midway.

It is worth noting that when Stilwell advanced in northern Burma and built the new overland Ledo Road, the results proved that it could not meet the needs of his offensive, even though the stated reason for opening the road was to transport goods to China.

Initially, in 1942, the U.S. airlift operation over the Hump was not valued by the China-Burma-India Theater Command. The responsible parties were not able to clearly recognize the importance of the airlift operation within China.

Officials from the Chinese National Defense Supplies Commission wanted to increase the tonnage of air cargo in 1942. General Bissell, representing Stilwell, told them that he estimated that if they wanted to transport 5,000 tons of cargo per month, they would need 25 large airfields and 300 aircraft in the Kunming area. In 1945, when the war ended, the cargo carried over the Hump each month showed the fragility of this estimate.

But Bissell's conservative attitude, based on his own experience, was not without reason. Before him, and before the Air Transport Command took over in 1942, General Clayton, who was responsible for the airlift operation over the Hump in the Theater Command, also had a conservative attitude.

In that year, the China National Aviation Corporation's airlift operation over the Hump had already exceeded the U.S. Army transport aircraft by a considerable amount. Stilwell had agreed to reduce the number of U.S. Army transport planes from 100 to 25, as ordered by the Air Force Command, on the grounds that the Hump route was not practical. When the Hump airlift operation was transferred to the Air Transport Command, it was opposed by the Theater Command to no avail.

In the months after the transfer of the Hump transport operation, the monthly transport volume was between 1,200 tons and 2,500 tons, and it remained so until the summer of 1943. General Stilwell did not seem to feel dissatisfied.

But I was dissatisfied. The Hump transport operation was directly related to all my efforts to make the Chinese Air Force Squadron and later the 14th Air Force an effective weapon. I was forced to believe that Stilwell only wanted to transport a few hundred tons of bombs, ammunition, fuel, and parts to China each month via air transport.

It was this effort to maintain the minimum strength of the Chinese Air Force that caused me to argue with Stilwell and Bissell in January 1943. At that time, the monthly supply of fuel and gasoline to the Chinese Air Force Squadron was about 750 tons, but Stilwell wanted to cut it in half.

Careful study showed that doing so would force the Chinese Air Force Squadron to abandon not only the offensive but also the air defense of various parts of China, except for the Chinese Air Force Squadron Command and Kunming, the main terminal of the Hump airlift route. At the same time, a considerable amount of cargo transported from the Hump was piling up at Yunnanyi, west of Kunming, and within the bombing range of Japanese aircraft in Burma and Indochina.

When I told General Bissell that reducing supplies would only allow me to defend Kunming, he replied that I must defend Yunnanyi. I could only reply that I did not know how to get the planes to take off without fuel.

So I flew to Chongqing to explain it to Stilwell in person. He verbally ordered me to stop the defense of Yunnanyi. I asked him to put it in writing, but he did not do so. But the next morning, I reversed the order and restored the cargo tonnage that had been cut.

### Control Yuan Members Oppose Railway Fare Increases; Believe That The Railway Bureau Has Failed To Economize Expenses; Decide To Request The Control Yuan To Send Personnel To Investigate

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The passenger and freight fares on the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Pukou railways have been adjusted again, and many members of the Control Yuan have expressed their dissatisfaction. The matter was discussed at a meeting of Control Yuan members on the morning of the 5th, who believed that the various railway bureaus had failed to economize expenses and had repeatedly increased fares, increasing the burden on travelers, which was inappropriate. Some Control Yuan members mentioned the new Nanjing railway station building of the two railway bureaus, which was extravagantly decorated. In this time of economic difficulty, it seemed wasteful. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to request the Control Yuan to send personnel to the various railway bureaus to investigate the actual situation of income and expenditure in order to determine the next concrete steps.

### Private Trade Representatives To Japan Urge The Promulgation Of Visa Regulations

The four private trade representatives to Japan from our country have been in Japan for more than two months. Because the government has not formally promulgated the bookkeeping visa regulations, trade cannot be carried out, and sales contracts have not yet been signed. Therefore, it has been decided to send representative Zeng Jigu back to the country to report to the government on the precautions for Sino-Japanese trade, and to urge the early promulgation of bookkeeping visa regulations, so that trade can be launched. Zeng has arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, and will go to Beijing soon. The second batch of private trade representatives to Japan will depart after the regulations are formally promulgated.

### Five Fake Flower Yarn Shops Busted; City Police Bureau Enforces Crackdown

The Flower Yarn Cloth Management Committee is implementing batch inspections of the contents of flower yarn shops in order to crack down on speculation.

### Public Opinion Committee to Regulate the Market: Considering Purchasing Rice Arriving at Port; Awaiting Director Wu's Return to Shanghai for Further Discussion

[Our Newspaper's Report] Rice prices have been falling for days, stabilizing public sentiment, and market transactions are sluggish. To prevent sluggish sales and affect sources from various regions, the Public Opinion Committee is considering purchasing rice arriving at the port. If rice merchants have inventory that cannot be sold, the committee may purchase it at market transaction prices, paying 80% of the total price first, and the remaining 20% after delivery. The purpose of this plan is not only to ensure smooth sources but also to enrich the committee's rice reserves so that it can supply rice at any time in case of market panic, thereby regulating the market. However, to implement this plan, a large amount of funds must first be prepared for purchases at any time, so it is still awaiting Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau to return to Shanghai from Nanjing for further discussion.

Faithless Wife's Evidence Is Conclusive

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the case of the marital discord between General Wang Zhuo and his wife Du Qin, Du Qin and her lover Tan Yuehan were prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office for adultery. The case has been transferred to the Criminal Court of the District Court for trial by Judge Zhong Xianda. The indictment stated briefly that Wang and Du were married in the 24th year of the Republic, and their relationship was not bad after marriage. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Wang suffered serious injuries in air combat and went to Hong Kong for recuperation. Later, in the 119th year of the Republic, he met Tan Yuehan, a Cantonese who worked in the Ministry of Economic Affairs, on the same ship. Because Wang's hearing in one ear was severely impaired and one eye was blind, Du was induced by Tan, and the two developed a relationship. Since then, they eloped several times. In November of the 35th year of the Republic, Du left home again and fled to Tianjin, where she lived with Tan Yuehan in Tianjin. Later, Tan was sent to the United States by the ministry. Wang tracked her down to Tianjin and found Du back. However, the relationship between the two had broken down, and they eventually became involved in litigation. Wang presented the love letters and joint photos between Tan and Du to the court, accusing them of harming the family, and summoned Du Qin to confess that she had had a relationship with Tan. The evidence of adultery is conclusive, and a public prosecution should be filed. Du Qin is still in custody.

### Tragedy at the Generalissimo's Office: Bear Bites Boy to Death

[Our Newspaper's Report] A child named Gao Genfa, ten years old, from Jiangsu, lived at No. 43, Yexin Lane, West Guangfu Road. Yesterday afternoon at around 5:40, he went to the Generalissimo Park with his friend Zhang Maotou. When they were lingering in the zoo, they saw two bears active in the wire mesh. Gao was inspired and climbed a short wall next to him and stepped on the wire mesh. Unexpectedly, he was fiercely bitten on the left leg by the bear, which refused to let go. The child cried for help in pain. After tourists and gardeners used all means for about half an hour, he finally got away, but most of the flesh on the child's leg had been bitten off. He fell into a coma. After being sent to Tongren Second Hospital, according to the doctor's diagnosis, the leg had to be amputated. Just as the operation was about to be performed, he died of excessive bleeding.

### Golden Coffin for Jin Jinbo's Remains: Family Seeks Spiritual Comfort; Lawyer Wang Writes to the Laozha Police Station, Presenting Two Points for Further Investigation

[Our Newspaper's Report] The remains of Jin Jinbo, a councilor of Wenling County who died in a car accident on Nanjing Road, were buried in a golden coffin at the Leyuan Funeral Home at 3 pm yesterday. The owner of the car involved in the accident, Dacheng Silk Weaving Factory, also sent someone to pay condolences and express their apologies to Jin's family. It is said that the factory owner Song Baolin is not currently in Shanghai and has telegraphed him to return to Shanghai to discuss the aftermath.

The reporter also visited Lawyer Wang Jian'e, who was hired by Jin's family. According to reports, Lawyer Wang has sent a letter to the Laozha Police Sub-bureau in charge of the case yesterday, raising two points: (1) Please check the machinery of the car involved in the accident to see if there are any situations that should be repaired but are not repaired. (2) According to the usual examples of car accidents, the car should immediately brake after running over a person. However, this car continued to slide for more than 30 feet after hitting a person and then ran over another person, which is very strange. It should be noted whether the driver of the car is mentally unsound or has other reasons. According to Lawyer Wang, Jin Jinbo's family does not focus on monetary and material compensation, what they need is spiritual comfort. They also hope that this tragedy will awaken the authorities' attention, strengthen vehicle control, improve traffic, and protect the safety of pedestrians. As for the legal responsibility, in addition to the driver's criminal responsibility for causing death due to negligence in business (maximum sentence of five years) and the car owner's civil responsibility for compensation, if the car's machinery is indeed damaged, the car owner should also bear the criminal responsibility for "not paying attention" under criminal law.

Driver Involved in Accident Sent to District Prosecutor's Office

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Laozha Police Sub-bureau yesterday escorted Yang Songyuan, the driver involved in the accident, to the District Prosecutor's Office, requesting an extension of the detention for five days.

Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Ding Tongjun went to the morgue on Changde Road to examine the body. According to the prosecutor, the car was driving too fast and avoided too quickly, causing it to rush onto the sidewalk and become uncontrollable. The driver of the car cannot shirk his responsibility.

### Bank Police Injure Person, Refuse to Respond to Summons: Zhang Jia'ao Sued

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Jia'ao, President of the Central Bank, was sued to the District Court by someone, and Judge Cao Zuwei is in charge of the trial, which is scheduled to open on the 8th of this month. It is reported that Li Changqing, a police officer of the Central Bank, hit and injured Li Yunbin, a trainee at the Central Police Academy, while riding a bicycle on Suzhou Creek Road on December 23 last year. After being sent to the hospital for treatment, he spent 80 million yuan on medical expenses and borrowed 5.5 taels of gold. Li Yunbin sued Li Changqing to the District Court for negligent injury and requested compensation for losses. The District Court repeatedly summoned the defendant but he failed to appear. The plaintiff believes that Zhang Jia'ao, the legal representative of the Central Bank, did not supervise strictly, causing the police officer to cause trouble outside and then be unscrupulous and refuse to respond to the summons. He has added Zhang as the second defendant.

### Allegations of Corruption in the Fisheries Management Office: The Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will Send Personnel to Investigate Thoroughly

[Our Newspaper's Report] The day before yesterday, a newspaper published a news article about the "Dark Secrets and Numerous Malpractices" of the Fisheries Management Office of the Custody Committee of the Executive Yuan's Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which ran for thousands of words and revealed eight major points of the Fisheries Management Office's main crimes. Yesterday, the reporter specifically inquired Zhao Junmai, the current director of the Fisheries Management Office, about this matter. According to Zhao, the points mentioned in the news article are inconsistent with the facts. Yesterday also happened to be the weekly routine meeting of the responsible supervisors of the office, and all supervisors of various units were present. At that time, this issue was raised at the meeting. After research, it was confirmed that it was inaccurate. The reporter further inquired whether the Control Yuan had sent personnel to investigate. Zhao said that the investigation by the Control Yuan was indeed a fact, but the committee member had returned to Nanjing after investigating that the points reported were inconsistent with the facts. As for the report that Director Zhao himself topped up a foreign house, according to Zhao, the house he currently lives in is an ordinary apartment. Whether there is a foreign house, the facts can prove it. He himself is unwilling to make any statements or corrections on this case, but welcomes people from all walks of life to visit or investigate the office on Fuxing Island at any time to clarify the truth. As for the attacks on the past directors, he cannot answer and can let them express their opinions themselves.

The reporter also inquired the Custody Committee of the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for their opinions. According to reports, the Fisheries Management Office was previously managed by the Executive Headquarters. Now that the Executive Headquarters has ended, the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is a new organization and does not know the situation of the past Executive Headquarters in detail. However, the committee will send personnel to thoroughly investigate the various points of corruption in the Fisheries Management Office reported in the newspaper.

### National Government Cables Request for Detention Too Late: Renault and His Party Leave Japan for the East

[Reuters Nanjing, 5th] The Chinese government has requested General MacArthur to escort Renault and his party, who left China on the afternoon of the 4th without the permission of the Chinese authorities, back to Shanghai. The US Air Force authorities stationed in Japan asked the Chinese government whether it wished to detain Renault and his party or send them back to China. The Chinese government's reply requested that Renault and others be extradited to China. The reasons for this are that Renault and others did not settle their outstanding affairs when they left Shanghai on the 4th, did not fulfill the routine customs procedures, and broke their promise to the Chinese side that they would not leave China until the entire issue of the exploration plan was resolved, which was a violation of China's sovereignty. After consultation between the Ministry of Communications and the Civil Aviation Administration, it was decided to request the Allied Headquarters to order Renault and others to return to China.

[Associated Press Tokyo, 5th] Renault took off in the "Explorer" plane from Haneda Airport here at 7:30 pm on the 5th (6:30 pm Shanghai time). The pilot was still Orton. The Allied Headquarters had approved him to continue flying in advance. Renault said that he would take a short break in Midway Island, then go to Hawaii to pick up his wife and two grandchildren, and then fly back to Chicago from San Francisco.

### President of the Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce Scolds Renault's Bad Deeds: The State Department Asks the Embassy in China to Investigate and Report

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mr. Xie Gai, President of the American Chamber of Commerce in this city, met with our newspaper's reporter yesterday and commented on the Renault incident: "I hope Chinese people will not regard Renault as a typical representative of all American businessmen in China. Renault is really a fool and a madman. He only hopes that his name will be in the newspaper, regardless of the content of the news. This matter is quite detrimental to the reputation of American businessmen in China. As the president of the American Chamber of Commerce, I feel very embarrassed after this incident. When I met with the US Consul General this morning, I frankly stated that in the future, the State Department should be more cautious when issuing passports than in the past to avoid similar incidents. In the future, if someone comes to China to conduct exploration and other plans, the methods and expenses should first be reported to the relevant US agencies for safekeeping and supervision. Otherwise, a madman like Renault may reappear. There are many valuable exploration groups in the international community, and Renault has greatly hindered them, because China has expressed suspicion of such groups because of this incident. Finally, I hope that the State Department can take a firm position on this bad deed."

[Associated Press Washington, 5th] State Department officials said on the 5th that they have asked the US Embassy in China to report in detail the situation that occurred in Shanghai with Renault. They refused to comment on Renault's "escape from China" before receiving the report.

Insulting Our Country: Making Wild Accusations

[Our Newspaper's Report] After escaping to Tokyo, Renault made wild accusations, insulting our side for "fabricating charges and attempting to extort money." He also lied that when his exploration plane took off, our airport guards fired shots, and our air force "rushed to chase." The Shanghai office of the Civil Aviation Administration solemnly denied Renault's rumours yesterday.

[United Press Tokyo, 5th] Renault flew to here from Shanghai last night without permission. He said that this escape was to avoid "financial bankruptcy." He also said, "Chinese guards held guns to prevent him and three crew members from boarding the plane. They followed me closely. I threw out fifty pens, which hit the door. The driver Auden started the engine and flew off the runway, and the guards dispersed."

Admitting to Breaching Promises

[Another Dispatch] Renault said that he would meet with the US Air Force Commander in the Far East today to complete the formalities for flying back to the United States. When Renault heard the reprimand from Jiang Bentong, the head of the Chinese Mount Jishi exploration team, he said: "Of course, I violated every promise I made to him in China. Under the shadow of coercion and light machine guns, I will always violate my promises. When I made promises to Mr. Sa, armed guards surrounded my plane, and I and my crew members were detained. This action violated the agreement and had no proper legal procedures. The only way I can get away is to allow them everything. I have to allow them in the past, present, and future in order to escape their grasp. As for my passport, it was forcibly taken away. They gave me a receipt. The Chinese side must explain what crime I have committed, and must not be vague."

Willing to Repay Our Debts

Renault also said that he came to Japan this time without a passport and owed China 53 million yuan, which he would send a check to repay. At the beginning, he was "forced to do" the exploration work, "they increased the personnel and expenses, and I had to agree."

No Bullet Holes in the Fuselage

[Associated Press Tokyo, 5th] US officials here on the 5th refused to comment on Renault's "escape" from China's absurd matter and frankly admitted that they were very puzzled by the international twists and turns caused by the flight. Renault's telegraph operator Lear said: "When the 'Explorer' plane took off from Longhua Airport, Chinese police fired shots." However, US Air Force officials said on the morning of the 5th that after a detailed inspection, there were no bullet holes or other damage on the fuselage. There would be no problem for Renault and his party to fly back to the United States, because he only violated Chinese law. However, people with good information believe that the United States will not go beyond its authority to enforce the law for China. Renault telegraphed his wife and the factory director of the ballpoint pen factory, Lamb, to report his safety and said that he would be returning soon.

Renault took a photo with Jiang Bentong in Nanjing on the 3rd when he made a promise, and left without saying goodbye the next day.

### Ministry Order to Halt Deferred Settlement Business; Hua Stocks See Universal Catastrophic Decline Yesterday; All Futures Stocks Drop to Limit, Fourteen Spot Stocks Drop to Limit

[Our Newspaper's Report] The local stock exchange received an order yesterday to ban deferred settlement business, resulting in a universal catastrophic decline in Hua stocks. As a result, fourteen spot stocks dropped to the limit, and all futures stocks dropped to the limit. Yong Yarn opened in the morning at 1407 yuan, hitting the limit, and there was even less trading in the afternoon. Yong Yarn was offered for sale at 1360 yuan, causing considerable public anxiety.

The financial and economic ministries' resident supervisory officials at the local stock exchange received instructions from the two ministries on the 3rd, stipulating four points (as seen on the first page of yesterday's newspaper). In addition to informing the Shanghai Municipal Government by telegram, they were instructed to immediately direct the stock exchange to ban deferred settlement business. Supervisory officials Wang and Li of the stock exchange notified the exchange authorities to take note and implement the instructions. The stock exchange officially announced the two ministries' ban in the market yesterday morning and stipulated that new deferred settlement transactions would be suspended starting from the morning market on April 5, 1948. Liquidation transactions could be conducted until the morning market on April 7 (Wednesday). All outstanding balances would still be settled on the originally agreed-upon date of April 9 (Friday). The stock exchange authorities also convened a meeting with the responsible directors of the Brokers' Association to explain the two ministries' regulations on banning deferred settlement transactions.

The Brokers' Association convened an extraordinary meeting of the standing directors at approximately 1:00 PM to discuss how to handle discrepancies in deferred settlement balances. At approximately 4:00 PM, they consulted with the stock exchange authorities again. It was ultimately decided that for all transactions in which brokers liquidate existing mutually offsetting deferred settlement positions on behalf of their clients, resulting in discrepancies in balances, a cash margin of 50% of the principal evidence would still be collected according to the original method. The balance limit for each broker would still be 20 billion national currency. In addition to the official announcement by the stock exchange, the Brokers' Association also sent circulars to all firms last night to take note, immediately comply, and liquidate deferred settlement transactions.

The Hua stock market was greatly intimidated by the suspension of deferred settlement at the beginning of the morning. The spot and deferred Yong Yarn opened at the limit, and the deferred Yong Yarn was even lower than the limit. After the opening, short sellers rushed to cover their positions, and the price once rose to 1495 yuan, the same price as the spot and deferred price. However, it immediately declared a limit down due to numerous sales. Yong Gong, Qin Xing, Xin He, Zui Lun, Match, Xinhua, Sino-French, and Xin Guang all declared a limit down. Except for Yong Yarn, Xin He, Xin Guang, Match, Yong Gong, Jing Yun, Qin Xing, and Sino-French, which remained at the limit down, Zhabei, Tong Yi, Business, Central Silk, and Xinhua rebounded after the limit down. China Cement fell by half a percentage point, Rong Feng, Li An, and Hua Xin fell by 10%, and National Goods fell by half. In deferred settlement stocks, Xin Guang fell by 10%, and Yong Yarn, Xin He, and Qin Xing hit the limit.

The situation worsened, and Yong Yarn remained at the limit. Subsequently, the trading volume became smaller and smaller. Except for China Cement, Lian Di, Rong Feng, Da Tong, Tong Yi, and Heng Feng, which did not hit the limit, Yong Ye and Xin Yi had no transactions, all others hit the limit. The immediate Yong Yarn even fell to 1350 yuan, which was comparable to the morning closing price of immediate Heng Feng. Hua Xin, Rong Feng, and Li An experienced a slight decline, Da Tong and Tong Yi fell by half a percentage point, and all others hit the limit. All deferred settlement stocks hit the limit. Most of the over-the-counter, unlisted stocks were flat and weak.

### Unified Bonds and Foreign Stocks are Both Weak

Public bonds were generally flat and weak yesterday, with a turnover of approximately 4 million. Unified Class C opened at 94,000, retreated from 96,000 to 89,000, and then consolidated slightly. Compared to last Saturday, Classes A, B, D, and E each fell by 1,000 yuan, and Unified Class C fell by 2,000 yuan.

Although foreign firms entered the market yesterday for foreign stocks, the securities, yarn, and flower firms seemed to liquidate due to balance issues. Jardine Yarn opened at 1.85 million in the morning, reached a high of 1.93 million, and finally retreated to close at 1.81 million.

### The Ministry of Finance Has Not Explicitly Stipulated the Location for Exchanging US Dollar Bonds

Only a Small Number Flow to Southern China

[Our Newspaper's Report] National Bank personnel stated: The Ministry of Finance has not made any explicit regulations regarding where maturing US dollar bonds can be exchanged, so they can be exchanged anywhere in the country. Furthermore, holders of the 1947 US dollar bonds that have matured, have wired the principal and interest to Southern China, effectively becoming a disguised outflow of funds to the South. The Gold Control Bureau is closely monitoring this. However, according to relevant sources, most US dollar bonds have already been exchanged in Shanghai, and only a small number have flowed to Southern China for exchange, so the problem is not serious.

### Few Cotton Yarn Transactions; Cloth Exhibits Buying Interest

The cotton yarn market situation yesterday showed an inverted price presentation by customer firms, and appetite tended to be sluggish. Local colleagues also took a wait-and-see approach, so trading in the market was mostly sporadic. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn saw good appetite among yarn merchants at the initial opening, and the market price jumped by 2 million to 195 million yuan. Some profit-taking occurred mid-way, and the price fell to 93 million yuan, similar to the closing price of the weekend. Subsequently, replicating manufacturers took advantage of the low prices to absorb the supply, and the price recovered to close at 196 million yuan, an increase of 3 million compared to the previous weekend.

Except for a slight decline of 1 million for 40-count Churen Bell yarn, the others were uneventful. 32-count of various brands fell back by 1 to 2 million yuan. 21-count Double Horse yarn was initially popular, rising by 2 million to 125 million yuan at the opening, but leveled out mid-way. Finally, due to floating short covering, it recovered to close at 124 million yuan, an increase of 1 million compared to the weekend. 20-count and 16-count and other coarse yarns had mixed sales and varying price fluctuations.

The cotton cloth market situation yesterday saw a slight increase at the morning opening due to the easing of credit and optimistic sentiment. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was quoted at 4.28 million yuan with occasional transactions. Although the sales to customer firms were sluggish, local colleagues absorbed a significant amount on behalf of securities firms, and banks also actively absorbed supplies. Credit was unusually loose, speculative funds were active, and buying interest was observed. The price of Dragon Head fine cloth gradually rose to 4.39 million and 4.4 million yuan. Near noon, news of stable yarn prices led to some profit-taking, and the price fell back to close at 4.37 million yuan, a further increase of 120,000 yuan compared to the previous weekend. Various grades of fine cloth such as Five Blessings, Blue Chicken, and Rainbow Ball also continued to rise by 160,000 to 170,000 yuan.

Four Gentlemen, Yuan Zhi Gong, and Serge, rose by 210,000 to 180,000 or 190,000 yuan due to the lack of recent allocations and insufficient inventory. The market for Shilin cloth and colored cloth tended to be stable. In addition, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, twill, etc., also saw firmer conditions.

### New Research by Renowned Scientist Albert Einstein

Publishes Important Paper on Gravity

[Central News Agency, New York, 4th Dispatch] Renowned scientist Albert Einstein recently published a paper on gravity, which is a major event in the scientific community. Scientists believe that this paper is a significant advance in Einstein's efforts to determine the exact relationship between electricity and gravity. Einstein's article, which was published in the Reviews of Modern Physics, uses mathematics that is so profound that most physicists cannot fully understand it. Scientists generally recall that when Einstein published the theory of relativity, only a very small number of scholars could understand it. Atomic energy secrets were broken by the theory of relativity, and physics experts now believe that Einstein's new research may help to discover other secrets of the universe.

### The Dongda University on the Brink of War

Yesterday, I made a special trip to visit the National Northeastern University and returned with many thoughts. Seeing the devastation of Dongda, I am deeply concerned about education in the Northeast. My impression of Dongda is very different from last summer. Now, the Dongda campus is damaged, the equipment is empty, and although learning continues in form, something is fundamentally missing. This is a double tragedy caused by high prices and the intensity of the gunfire. Chinese education is facing the most serious juncture, and the problem of education in the Northeast is even more serious.

The environment in the Northeast is too harsh. Mr. Liu Shuxun, the president of Dongda, explains all the problems by pointing to the special environment, constantly shaking his head. Dongda's first lesson of the new semester is the "relocation issue." These days, the university is busy with make-up examinations for the previous semester. After the term exams, the "Strive for Relocation" movement will be the central task of the student union. Most professors keep their opinions hidden, but secretly support relocation. Where to relocate? The goal in everyone's mind is Beiping, but no one has explicitly stated it. President Liu has not expressed any opinion on the relocation, denying that it is happening, believing that relocating and not relocating are equally difficult. The president is acting in accordance with the Ministry of Education's orders, and I don't think the Ministry of Education has issued a formal relocation order.

The arguments for relocation are well-reasoned. They say: if the university does not relocate, it will be a declaration of bankruptcy for education in the Northeast! The slogans and cartoons demanding relocation add much-needed color to the desolate Dongda campus, with students posting them while campus workers wash them away. Theoretically, education requires a stable social environment with a stable political economy. Education in war and famine cannot recover well. The rise and fall of a university reflects the ebb and flow of national culture. Wouldn't it be a pity if it were destroyed by gunfire! The National Jilin Changbai Normal College is a case in point.

Dongda has five colleges—Liberal Arts, Science, Agriculture, Engineering, and Law and Commerce—with twenty-three departments, and a physical education specialty. There are more than 2,800 students, with about 2,200 registered this semester. Some students have gone to Beiping, some have been stranded as their hometowns have fallen, and another 85 students have been ordered to withdraw from school by the Xingyuan Command due to suspicion of being Communists. President Liu said, "I am very sorry, the actual number of students on campus is not very clear, and the work of moral education is not performing well. I cannot guarantee that there are no Communists in the school." As for the quality of these two thousand students, whether they are all talented individuals who can be cultivated is hard to say. Judging from the number of students in each college, there are fewer students in the Liberal Arts and Science colleges, which shows that language, history, art, and pure science are not valued. There are very few students in the Engineering college, indicating that the level of high school students in the Northeast is very low, because the Engineering college has stricter admission standards. The Law and Commerce college has the most students, nearly a thousand, accounting for one-half of the entire school. Is this to provide shelter and relief, or is it limited by job prospects after graduation?

Dongda is pitifully poor, with a monthly budget of 20 million yuan. Electricity costs take up 12 million yuan, and professors in the dormitories are still complaining about not having electricity. It is so poor that even exam paper is a problem. Everything is waiting to be revived. There is no chemical equipment in the teaching building, the library's walls are bare, garbage is piled all over the school, and buildings are thawing, leaking, and damaged without repair. It is indeed too difficult and too bitter to study in such an environment, no wonder the students are clamoring to go home. There is also an artillery regiment stationed on campus. A few days ago, when Shenyang was tense, the sound of artillery rumbled all day long. One humorous soldier in the artillery regiment said to the students, "Please don't be afraid, we are going to fire." It's both laughable and absurd! (Zhao Zhan, our correspondent stationed in Shenyang, April 2nd)

### Conant on University Education

— Liren

Mr. Conant, the president of Harvard University in the United States, recently released a report on Harvard University. In this report, Mr. Conant has several passages on the general topic of university education, which are well worth our attention. The following is an introduction to these passages.

Mr. Conant believes that a university is a group of scholars working towards peaceful goals, striving for teaching and the advancement of knowledge. However, the current divided world, a state of armed truce, is particularly an unpleasant phenomenon for scholars. The evolution of the post-war world situation has undoubtedly cast a dark shadow on our higher education. Now, our universities, as in wartime, have many tasks that must be done for the government. Although we are very willing to do these jobs, some of them are not entirely peaceful, nor are they pleasant.

In such a world, Mr. Conant believes that university authorities and individuals have a clear responsibility, and that is to promote the exchange of world cultures. The exchange of professors and students between countries should be promoted and carried out with enthusiasm. Secondly, we should also strive to study the cultural types of other nations, so that we can understand the ideological backgrounds or assumptions of leaders of other countries as much as possible. In particular, we must understand the nations behind the so-called Iron Curtain. For example, if there are erroneous assumptions about the fundamental attitude of the Soviet Union, this is not only dangerous for ourselves, but also for peace. Therefore, in today's world, gaining a mature understanding of the culture and ideology of other nations is the most important and most difficult.

Mr. Conant believes that the existence of a university can be supported by or controlled by people, but a university is not an organ of the government, nor is it a private group. The professors in the university are not hired workers. The criteria for selecting professors are unique in some ways. This cannot be confused with the conditions for the government to appoint officials. There are many very learned scientists or philosophers who, because they have the ideal of universal brotherhood, may not be able to be government officials to negotiate treaties for the government, but from the point of view of their learning, they are very valuable to the university.

Mr. Conant believes that the activities of scholars in the university are based on free research as a necessary foundation. Without free research, you can have an institution of higher education, a vocational school, or a military academy, but you do not have a university. A university has free research as a necessary condition. I think we must agree on this point. Objective analysis of all aspects of our national life cannot be hindered in any way. Even in today's armed truce, we cannot sacrifice this principle. The nation has the right to demand that our professors in the university become fearless seekers of truth and prudent scholars on controversial topics, rather than propagandists. As long as the professors are faithful, sincere, and capable, we should always tolerate a wide range of different opinions.

Although the above paragraphs from the president of Harvard University are addressed to the United States, they are equally applicable when transferred to our country. The author sincerely hopes that our educational authorities will not ignore these paragraphs.

### Lao Tzu's Dao Technique

— Yan Qun

Lao Tzu's "Dao" actually combines both substance and function. The Dao has both substance and function, just as an object has a head and tail, and just as a matter has a beginning and an end. The two complement each other, and neither is sufficient to be the Dao without the other. Substance is potentiality, and function is actuality. When potentiality reaches actuality, it is a natural and inevitable trend. Therefore, the Dao's progression from substance to function is also a natural and inevitable trend. What is the trend? Opposites complement each other, and opposites conquer and generate each other. The substance of the Dao is stillness, and its function is movement. Movement is the opposite of stillness. Therefore, the Dao's progression from substance to function follows the trend of opposites. Opposites have an opposite and a counter-opposite. The two alternate: what was previously the opposite turns into the counter-opposite, and what was previously the counter-opposite turns into the opposite. This is why stillness must come from movement, why movement must return to stillness, why the Dao progresses from substance to function and returns from function to substance, why all things have birth and death, formation and destruction, and why human affairs have order and chaos, prosperity and decline, returning in cycles, again and again. This is called Dao Technique. Dao Technique is nothing more than the path by which the substance of the Dao is activated, flows, and manifests in its function. Lao Tzu calls Dao Technique "trend," because it is natural and inevitable. What is this natural and inevitable thing? Opposites complement each other, opposites conquer and generate each other, that's all. Opposites complement each other, opposites conquer and generate each other, these are the ultimate principles of the universe's myriad transformations. Their scattered manifestations in the people and things are like birth and death, formation and destruction, fullness and emptiness, bending and straightening, order and chaos, prosperity and decline, disaster and fortune, likeness and illusion, beauty and ugliness, good and evil... their numbers are endless.

The trend of opposites exists within the substance of the Dao, so stillness must have movement, and the Dao must progress from substance to function. Stillness and movement, substance and function, only because they are opposites that generate each other, they are mutually dependent. Therefore, the substance of the Dao, which is without opposites, actually encompasses the principles of opposites. Those who seek the root of being have a difficult problem: the root of being must be absolute, that is certain, but the fact that all things are relative cannot be hidden. The root of being is unmoving and unchanging, that is also certain, but the fact that all things are changing and impermanent cannot be hidden. So how can the root of being, which is without opposites and unchanging, evolve into the myriad things that are opposite and changing? In terms of nominalism, absolute and relative, stillness and movement, constancy and change, are all mutually exclusive concepts. How can things that are mutually exclusive generate each other? For example, if we take the "Being" of Parmenides of Greece as the root of being, it is also absolute, still, and constant. Then the phenomenon of relative, moving, and changing universe cannot be explained. In the end, we must regard it as "Non-being," and the theory of the universe cannot be established. By forced justification, such as what his book calls "The way of opinion," we can also see that it must be justified. Another example is Empedocles's fire, air, water, and earth, and Anaxagoras's material species. Their root of being is also unmoving and unchanging. However, the birth and death, formation and destruction of the universe's myriad things are not sufficient to be caused by the unmoving and unchanging root of being alone. Therefore, they seek a separate cause of motion (Efficient or moving cause) outside of the root of being, such as Empedocles's two forces of "love" and "hate," and Anaxagoras's "mind" (Nous-mind). But seeking a cause of motion separately from the root of being means that the cause of motion is relative to the root of being. The universe's myriad things do not originate solely from the root of being, but must be aided by the cause of motion. Therefore, their root of being is not monistic. Only Lao Tzu's "Dao" actually encompasses the principle of opposites, so stillness can cause movement, and substance can reach function. Thus, the monistic root of being can be established. Why? Because the universe's myriad things that are changing and impermanent all derive their origin and have their destination here. Once the root of being, which combines both movement and stillness, substance and function, is established, then the universe's myriad things of birth and death, formation and destruction, are all the inevitable results of this root of being. This is why I say that such a universe must come from such a root of being, and that its theory of the root of being and its cosmology are consistent, and without the flaws of nominalism. But its reason for being like this also relies on its understanding of the trend of opposites conquering and generating each other, taking this trend as inherent in the substance, and taking this trend as the form. Then, all phenomena that conquer and oppose each other will inevitably lead to the effect of generating and complementing each other, and the myriad things will emerge. Therefore, this trend is actually the pivot of transition and evolution between the root of being and the universe. Understanding the effect of this trend is why Lao Tzu's theory of the root of being and his cosmology are consistent, like the two ends of a hammer.

If we analyze it, Lao Tzu's ability to understand the trend of opposites complementing each other depends on not being confined to human thinking when observing things and events, but directly exploring the natural principles of the universe. The so-called human thinking refers to the path followed by people in their thinking, the so-called Laws of Thought. The Laws of Thought are: (1) the Law of Identity, which states: what is, is; (2) the Law of Contradiction, which states: a thing cannot both be and not be; (3) the Law of Excluded Middle, which states: a thing must either be or not be. What the Laws of Thought clarify can be summarized in one sentence: the consistency of thought. When people think, they must base it on their point of view at that time and place, and have something to refer to: if something is referred to as A, then the meaning of that thing is limited to A, and cannot also be non-A, or hesitate between A and non-A. This shows that people's point of view is limited, what is referred to is true, and what is not referred to is untrue. True and untrue, from a human perspective, seem to be opposites that are mutually exclusive, but in discussing things in terms of things, they are both just things, so what opposite can be said? If something is referred to as a horse, then what is not referred to is a non-horse, a non-horse can be a cow or a sheep... the world is certainly full of things that are not horses. Calling it a non-horse simply means that the point of view is not there, and it is generalized with "non" in order to distinguish it from the point of view's location. The reason why a thing is a thing is because it has differences. The differences may be large or small, such as hot and cold, the difference is large; hot and warm, the difference is small. It is certainly not that cold is the opposite of hot, or that warm is not the opposite of hot. What is opposite of hot is only "non-hot." The so-called "non-hot" exists in people's concept, the label of language, in order to facilitate thinking. There is no thing that is "non-hot." Things are constantly changing and flowing. Hot dissipates and becomes warm, and it further dissipates and becomes cold. This is a natural and inevitable trend. Hot and cold are clearly two in concept, but in things they are the beginning and end of a single event. What is two in concept is opposite and mutually exclusive; what is the beginning and end in things gradually affects each other; accumulating concepts as thoughts and words, it is said that opposites affect each other, but in reality, things truly affect each other, but they are not opposites. Lao Tzu has probably seen this, so he uses human thinking to observe things and language to carry thoughts (matters of knowledge cannot be separated from the path of thinking and the tools of language, although they are obstructed by them, there is nothing to be done). He reveals the trend of mutual conquering and generating, mutual opposing and affecting in the midst of myriad transformations, in order to see that mutual conquering and opposing are not actually mutually conquering and opposing, but there is always one thing that runs through them. What is this one thing? The Dao is one. Moreover, Lao Tzu's seeing the mutual connection of opposites, because he is able to break the array of concepts and obtain the truth of things, taking what is opposite to people as not truly opposite in events and things, thus being able to affect each other: his still calling it "opposite" is to speak to ordinary people using the language of ordinary people, only hoping for mutual understanding.

Because Lao Tzu observes things and events with the trend of opposites complementing each other, his nominalism is different from ordinary nominalism. Ordinary nominalism takes the consistent Laws of Thought as its foundation, while Lao Tzu's nominalism takes the natural principle of opposites complementing each other as its ultimate goal. In ordinary nominalism, consistency lies in the point of view at one time and one place; in Lao Tzu's nominalism, consistency exists in the absolute substance of the Dao. A point of view is a matter possessed by people in their activities; the substance of the Dao is the pivot of the activities of transformation and flow. Therefore, Lao Tzu's nominalism is not the law of human beings seeking knowledge, but the path of transformation and flow; to express it in the terminology of Western philosophers, it is so-called metaphysical logic.

### Rumor Psychology (II)

— Fang Zheng

The spread of rumors, psychologically speaking, is equivalent to serial reproduction. A model, in recollection, gradually loses its original appearance and tends toward a certain stereotype. Exaggeration, distortion, rationalization, and elaboration are the main trends in this change. This article will focus on these points.

The first is exaggeration. For example, in 1942, an American coal ship had an accident, but the rumor became "an American ship was torpedoed and sunk, with thousands of nurses on board all drowned." After Pearl Harbor was attacked, the United States did indeed lose many warships, but the rumor was that all American warships in the Pacific were destroyed. Often it is just a little thing, but the rumor always exaggerates it into a big deal. A rumor is a rumor because it is always an exaggeration.

However, exaggeration is not necessarily a manifestation of abnormal psychology, i.e., so-called exaggeration in the mind. It is a common phenomenon shared by general memory processes. For example, Gibson experimented with people's memory of pictures, with the following results:

In the first row, the first person had the impression of a "star" from the original picture, so the recollection became a "star" shape, and the point protruding from the right side of the original picture was exaggerated into a large angle. The second person's impression was a "flying bird," and the wings on both sides were lengthened and made more prominent. The third person's impression was an "arrowhead," and the point protruding from the right side was elongated into a trapezoid. The fourth person's impression was an "arrow," and the protruding point was stretched into an arrow shaft. The situation in the second row is similar. In the third and fourth rows, either the whole (all combined) or the part (more divergent) is exaggerated. It is worth noting that in the experimental situation, everyone is trying to recall the original picture, and their hearts are tending towards the truth. Even with the effort to be realistic, the exaggeration is still so great. Without this realistic mood, the exaggeration would naturally be even more unimaginable.

The result of exaggeration is distortion. But exaggeration still preserves some of the original appearance, while distortion completely changes the appearance. Here is an example of an experiment by Professor Bartlett of Cambridge University. This experiment is closer to the nature of rumors because he used "person-to-person" serial recall in the experiment. The original image is an ancient Egyptian letter Mnlak, the prototype of the letter M in Western alphabets. After the first person saw this letter, he drew it from memory. This is "Reproduction 1" in the figure. After the second person saw "Reproduction 1", he drew it from memory again, which is "Reproduction 2". It was passed down one by one, just like the spread of rumors. By the time it reached the tenth person, the result had completely become a cat, and the subsequent reproductions differed greatly from the original.

In some of the pictures above, there is a trend that is very noteworthy. That is, rigid, straight-line angular lines become very smooth, very natural lines. More natural, or more normalized, is the third trend we call: rationalization. The Egyptian ancient text M was originally the pictograph of an "owl." But this kind of writing is still a bit forced, and it looks a bit awkward. Therefore, the lines are becoming smoother and smoother, and the details are becoming more and more rationalized. The original line sloping down slowly became a tail, and it became lower and lower, and then it completely shrank to the bottom, and then it was exaggerated and dragged into a long tail. Even more interesting is that the "inverted person" character originally drawn in the middle of the head eventually evolved into a flower knot.

In this rationalization process, the fourth trend, elaboration, is also involved. More and more shaded, decorative lines are added, and finally, not only the whole body has fur, but also whiskers and flower knots. This is the most common "adding fuel to the fire" process in rumors. For example, rumors often have such a saying to gain credibility. At first, it may just be "I heard it from someone," then it becomes "someone very reliable said it," then it becomes "someone authoritative said it," then it becomes "a senior official of a certain headquarters said it," then it becomes "a certain commander-in-chief said it," and finally it may even become "a certain commander-in-chief personally said it to someone at a certain meeting." An empty "someone" finally evolved into not only a real person, but also a real place, time, and occasion. Therefore, I say that rumors have a certain trend, as if they must move towards a certain stereotype.

### Anecdotes from the Academic World (16)

— Zhang Qiyun

Mr. Sun Zhongrong

Sun Yirang, styled Zhongrong, was born on August 19th (September 16th in the Gregorian calendar), 1848, in Rui'an County, a coastal area of Wenzhou, Zhejiang. Last year was the centenary of his birth. The mid-Qing Dynasty was the heyday of the textual research school, but politically, the sea frontiers were fraught with troubles, and the world was changing rapidly. His father, Qinxi Gong (Yiyan), was praised by Zhang Taiyan as a unique Confucian scholar in the late Qing Dynasty. Throughout his life, he devoted himself to promoting the Yongjia School in his hometown, which was one of the important branches of Zhejiang Eastern learning since the Song Dynasty. The main purpose of Zhejiang Eastern learning is to inherit the transmission of Chinese literature throughout history, integrate both classics and governance, take national affairs as its own responsibility, understand modern times and learn from the past, in order to apply them to the world. In the eleventh year of Tongzhi (1872), when Mr. Zhongrong was twenty-five years old, he wrote the preface to the "Collection of Idle Talks from the Genzhai Study" by Xue Jixuan of the Song Dynasty on behalf of Qinxi Gong (Collected Writings of Diligent Preparation, Volume 4), roughly stating that "Since the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras, great Confucians have emerged in large numbers, and those devoted to the study of human nature and classics each adhere to their own methods, without borrowing from each other. The division between Han and Song has been absolute. Yiyan once discussed the shortcomings of factionalism with scholars in the capital, and often believed that to integrate the strengths of Han and Song and bridge their divisions, there is nothing better than using the learning of Yongjia." This passage also describes Mr. Zhongrong's own academic goals. In that year, he began to work on his lifelong masterpiece, "Annotations and Commentary on the Rites of Zhou," which was completed in the twenty-fifth year of Guangxu (1899), when Mr. was fifty-two years old, with a total of eighty-six volumes. Two years later, he wrote "Essentials of the Rites of Zhou" in two volumes. Mr. died on May 22nd in the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu (1908) at the age of sixty-one. This year marks the fortieth anniversary of his death.

The Rites of Zhou, originally called the Zhou Guan, is the most complete classic on the Zhou Dynasty's political system. The Rites of Zhou consists of six sections, each beginning with the words "Establishing the Nation." This is a blueprint for nation-building from two thousand years ago. The entire book is grand in scope and profound in thought, containing tens of thousands of words, and is unparalleled in the world. It is the work of a first-class intellect from the pre-Qin period, based on historical facts and infused with ideals. There are different opinions on the date of its composition, but we can try to verify it through geography. The book's description of the nine provinces of the world includes Youzhou in the northeast, with the Wulv Mountain near present-day Jin County, Liaoning, as its main feature. This shows that its composition was likely after the power of the Yan State reached beyond the customs. According to the reign of King Zhao of Yan (311-279 BC), Qin Kai was a general who defeated the Donghu, expanded the territory by over a thousand miles, and established five commanderies (Shanggu, Yuyang, Youbeiping, Liaoxi, and Liaodong), building the Great Wall to defend against the Hu. The Yan State expanded its territory at the beginning of the third century BC, so the writing of the geography could not have been earlier than this. King Wuling of Zhao's adoption of the Hu clothing and mounted archery was around the end of the fourth century BC. The Rites of Zhou still describes chariot warfare, so its era should not have been later than that. Based on this inference, the author of the Rites of Zhou was likely a figure from the late Warring States period, in the third century BC, contemporary with Xun Zi, and about a century later than the Greek philosopher Plato, who wrote "The Republic."

Mr. Zhongrong said in his preface that the study of the Rites of Zhou should be based on "ancient meanings and ancient systems, thoroughly explained and verified." Textual research is only a tool for learning. He once said, "Scholars who inherit learning only regard the Zhou classics and Han commentaries as a treasure trove of textual research. How can they not become straw dogs that have already been discarded?" (Preface to Annotations and Commentary on the Rites of Zhou). He divided ancient meanings and ancient systems into two. Ancient systems are the traces of governance, subject to the limitations of time and space, and may not be applicable to later generations. Ancient meanings are the principles of governance, and "the most refined aspects of governance must be consistent with the public principles of all things" (Preface to Essentials of the Rites of Zhou). This is a universal principle that can be applied anywhere. The conclusion of the Annotations and Commentary on the Rites of Zhou contains the following passage:

"If there are gentlemen in the world who can understand the reasons for heaven and humanity, and understand the origins of order and chaos, and can take this classic and thoroughly study its theories, using ancient meanings and ancient systems to understand the grand intentions and subtle purposes of politics and education, organizing and explaining them, writing a special book to elaborate and expand upon them, to await later sages, and perhaps use this humble book as a guide and pioneer, then this is what I privately hope for but cannot meet."

Mr. Zhongrong was very modest, saying that he "only introduced the beginnings and dared not let his theories run wild." In fact, his political ideas were already revealed everywhere in the annotations of the Annotations and Commentary on the Rites of Zhou. Later, the book Essentials of the Rites of Zhou, with a total of forty-eight chapters including diagrams and maps, was developed more fully.

The Annotations and Commentary on the Rites of Zhou was started in the late Tongzhi period, after the Sino-French War. Mr. said himself that "he was concerned about the state of the world and sighed while holding the scroll." The entire book was completed in the year of the Wuxu Reform. The discussion of reform began in the year of defeat to Japan in the Sino-Japanese War, reached its peak in the Wuxu year, but was thwarted by the resistance of the old forces. At that time, the distinction between Western and Chinese, new and old, was confusing and bewildering. Mr. Zhongrong believed that the cause of wealth and power was rooted in politics and education, "to discuss wealth and power without politics and education is like cutting off the rivers and streams to reach the sea." The Rites of Zhou is a collection of the essence of ancient political systems, and its links to the causes of wealth and power of the Western nations in modern times are connected. Mr. Zhongrong examined the past to discuss governance, distinguishing between changeable traces and unchanging principles, and strongly argued that there was no difference in the paths of China and the West, new and old, "so that stubborn scholars would reflect on their own and have nothing to say." In particular, after writing Annotations and Commentary on the Rites of Zhou, he wrote Essentials of the Rites of Zhou to supplement it. In the late Qing Dynasty, Mr. made a great contribution to the transformation of thought from old to new. Mr. was a powerful torchbearer for the establishment of the Republic of China. (According to Zhang Taiyan's letter to Mr. Zhongrong, Mr. signed the preface with "Yihai, two hundred and thirty-eight years after Xinchou". Xinchou refers to the year of Shunzhi 18, when Emperor Yongli was captured. Also, Mr.'s inscription on Tinglin's Collection of Poems contains two quatrains: "Closing the book in the wind, I suddenly sigh, the country has been lost for three hundred years", which can be said to be an expression of his feelings). Now, forty years have passed since Mr.'s death, and the resistance of the conservatives is no longer a concern. Another group of people often ignores our country's historical traditions, loses national self-confidence, belittles Chinese culture, and advocates Westernization, like building pavilions on sand, and even develops into a centrifugal force, plunging the country into division, which may be a greater obstacle to the new policy than the conservatives of that year. Now that the constitutional government has begun, the crystallization of Mr. Zhongrong's lifelong research is worth our careful understanding. The author has written an article on Sun Yirang's political thought, divided into (1) statistical cartography, (2) grassroots organization, (3) national livelihood, (4) educational purpose, which is briefly explained in the Zhejiang Journal, and will not be repeated here.

### On Hunger Strikes

— Jing Wen

Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian saint who used hunger strikes as a last resort, is dead, but the trend of hunger strikes has not ended with Gandhi.

Food is the paramount necessity of the people. Human life cannot be separated from the need for food. An infant knows to ask for milk as soon as it is born. A death row prisoner still has the appetite to drink large bowls of wine and eat large chunks of meat before going to the execution ground. A large part of the world's cultural achievements are probably related to the need for food. And all social problems, in the final analysis, are nothing more than the problem of eating. Even the noble poet Tao Yuanming once bent his waist for five pecks of rice.

Since the issue of eating is so important, it is somewhat inconceivable that many people are still willing to use hunger strikes as a last resort to achieve their goals. Perhaps, as religious people say, people do not live by bread alone. Besides the basic desire for food, there are many more important spiritual needs. For example, "losing one's chastity is a big matter, starving to death is a small matter" expresses that in the balance between bread and integrity, one should weigh their importance. Boyi and Shuqi, who were ashamed to eat the Zhou Dynasty's millet and were willing to starve to death on Shouyang Mountain, are an example.

However, a hunger strike is ultimately a last resort. Those who take this measure must understand that the spiritual requirements they uphold are indeed worth using a hunger strike as a means of protest, and they must also be able to grasp the sympathy of the masses. Because a hunger strike is an act of sacrifice, and sacrifice should have value. The reason for the sacrifice must be based on the interests of the public. Only in this way can one's own hunger strike sacrifice be exchanged for the strength of the masses.

Gandhi's repeated hunger strikes met these conditions. Because Gandhi demanded the liberation of India, which was the demand of every Indian. His anti-violence and non-resistance, given the situation in India at the time, could also win the sympathy of the world. Therefore, Gandhi's hunger strike was a true sacrifice with a noble cause. Although Gandhi ultimately died not from a hunger strike but at the hands of thugs, his firm will expressed by repeatedly using hunger strikes as a last resort finally led to India's independence today.

But while it is also a hunger strike, in some situations it cannot win the sympathy of most people. For example, some men and women often resort to hunger strikes due to family disputes. Although there are also some aspects worthy of pity, once everyone calms down, they will find that things do not need to be done so seriously, and there are many other solutions besides hunger strikes.

The most unsympathetic hunger strike is to use hunger strikes as a means of coercion to achieve selfish goals. In the past, women in old-fashioned families liked to use crying, starving, and hanging as a means of coercion against their husbands. However, old-fashioned women who were forced to do this still had something to be pitied, because at that time, society did not allow the rebellious spirit of women like "Nora". In order to win the love of their husbands, women sometimes had to resort to this last resort.

However, for those who are not in a situation like Gandhi, hunger strikes are ultimately a bad strategy. Unless it is absolutely necessary, it is best to eat more. Because if one is shouting for a hunger strike while eating fruit or drinking milk, it is difficult to gain sympathy after all.

I believe that as society progresses, there will be fewer and fewer phenomena of using hunger strikes as a tool of resistance. For example, in European and American societies, one rarely sees people on hunger strikes, unless it is a fast day. Workers there demand higher wages and strive to improve their treatment, mostly using positive and active methods, and there are very few "starving workers" or hunger strikes. Although it also takes courage to actually do a hunger strike (like Gandhi), it is ultimately a passive behavior. Most problems in the world can be solved by arguing on the basis of reason. As the saying goes, if you have a reason, you can fight even the highest authority. As long as the reason is just and bright, people's sympathy will always stand on your side. Even if you don't win this time, there will be plenty of opportunities in the future. To be honest, there are not many people in the world who can gain sympathy by going on a hunger strike. As far as I can see, there is only Gandhi.

### Foreign Liquor and Shaoxing Wine

— Ying Zhi

It is a great thing to gather three or five old friends in a small room on a dreary, rainy day, to be slightly tipsy and have a good time. However, the price of wine is getting higher and higher, and I am afraid that poor people cannot afford it. It is better to read what others have written about wine. There are many kinds of wine. Roughly, they can be divided into two major categories: distilled liquor and Shaoxing wine. The Qing people discussed their merits, such as Xu Chenglie's "Notes from the Listening Rain Pavilion," which says: "The types of wine are difficult to enumerate, but distilled liquor is the most potent. Drinking too much can often lead to burning hair and rotting intestines, which is frightening. When I was in Guangdong in the past, I drank foreign liquor, which was amber in color and very mellow in the mouth. But in the stomach, it felt like being branded by fire, unbearably hot. Even those with a large capacity dare not finish one 'he'. Later, I was a guest in Wuyuan, Guangxi, which has always been known for its good distilled liquor, with categories such as single-distilled, double-distilled, triple-distilled, and quadruple-distilled. Single-distilled is similar to our local wheat liquor but more mellow. Double-distilled is more potent, and triple-distilled is undrinkable. I tried to drink a cup, and it tasted fragrant and spicy, like a fuse running straight from the throat to the 'dantian' (lower abdomen). I felt hot all over my body and was drunk for half a day before I woke up. The color of quadruple-distilled is slightly green, and I dare not taste it. Smelling its aroma is enough to get drunk. I heard that it does not use rice or flour, but is purely distilled from double-distilled liquor, so it is so fragrant and potent."

It also says: "Yellow wine is best from Jun, while distilled liquor values lightness the most. Each jar of single-distilled is ten 'jin' (about 5 kg), while double-distilled weighs only eight 'jin', and quadruple-distilled is only five or six 'jin'. I have verified this and there is no error. The price of double-distilled is double that of single-distilled, triple-distilled is three times that of single-distilled, and quadruple-distilled is double that of double-distilled. The seller always uses the value of single-distilled as the standard. People say that single-distilled contains 'Hegemon's Whip' (a medicinal herb; its root is neither wood nor vine, it grows only one node each year, like a child's arm, green in color, with four sharp thorns and no branches or leaves, and white oil spurts out when its skin is broken, and people plant it in their gardens for hedges, some growing to seven or eight 'chi' [about 2.3-2.7 meters]), and those who indulge in it often suffer from madness in their legs. Double-distilled and above do not contain it, but this cannot be known for sure. When I was in Lingnan, I only liked Shaoxing yellow wine, and I dared not drink distilled liquor often." Liang Zhangju's "Random Talks While Wandering" also says of distilled liquor: "The name of distilled liquor cannot be found in ancient times. It first appears in Bai Juyi's poem 'Distilled liquor is first opened, amber in color,' which means it was red, not like today's white liquor. The Yuan people called it 'sweat wine,' and Li Zhongbiao called it 'Araqi liquor,' writing in a poem: 'It took many years to obtain the method of sweat wine, one is worth ten in taste and rich.' This is the true distilled liquor of today. Today, all grain-producing areas have distilled liquor, and that brewed from sorghum is the most authentic. The persimmon liquor, Lu liquor, and Fen liquor of the North are all made from sorghum, but the taste of the water is different, and the strength of the liquor also varies accordingly. I once heard a foreign barbarian say: 'China has a supreme treasure, but people do not know how to consume it,' referring to sorghum distilled liquor. They also taught people how to consume it, saying that between midnight and the 'hai' hour (9-11 pm) every night, one should wake up from a hazy sleep and consume a cup of this liquor, accompanied by a light dish. After drinking, one should fall back asleep, which is very beneficial." Zhangju also said to himself: "As an official with a busy life, I may not be able to go to bed between the 'hai' and 'zi' hours (11 pm-1 am), and it is also difficult to find the right person to serve me at night," so he happened to have a "Shandong subordinate magistrate" who anticipated his wishes and taught him a method of consuming it in the middle of the night, without the need for manpower, and comfortable and free, "Every cold night, consuming this is especially enjoyable," so he "practiced it as prescribed from Shandong to this day for nearly twenty years." Also, his "Random Talks While Wandering," "Trivial Notes from Returning to the Countryside," and other books record many medicinal wine recipes, saying that Tusu wine is also medicinal wine, showing that this old bureaucrat, immersed in food and medicine, was very dull. However, he also knew Shaoxing wine, as he says in "Random Talks": "Today, Shaoxing wine is popular throughout the country and can be called the orthodox wine, but there are also those who make unwarranted criticisms. They have not tasted the best of Shaoxing wine. People often laugh that Shaoxing wine is just ordinary wine, but it is sold all over the world, even reaching the remote regions of Xinjiang. Frankly speaking...in terms of the popularity of wine, no other wine is sufficient to compete, because the water between Shanyin and Kuaiji is most suitable for wine, and it cannot be good if it is moved to another place. Therefore, all other prefectures have Shaoxing people who brew it according to the method, but since the water is different, the taste is far inferior; even in Shaoxing itself, good wine is not easy to obtain, but the further it is sold, the better it is, because it cannot travel far unless it is the best. I have tasted wine in Gansu, Longxi, and Guilin, and the wine I obtained was excellent, and it was even better outside Jiayuguan. If it is near the Central Plains, it cannot be drunk unless it has been stored for several years. The best is called 'Daughter Wine'. It is said that rich families brew several jars as soon as they have a daughter, and they are not opened until the daughter gets married. So it is at least ten years old. The jars are usually painted with colorful paintings and called 'Flower Carvings.' Recently, there have been many forgeries, even using flower cans to hold ordinary wine to deceive people. When identifying wine, the lighter the jar, the better, because the more aged the wine, the more it shrinks. Some jars shrink to half their original size. If you knock on the bottom of the jar with a cone, the sound of a real one is clear, while the sound of a fake or spoiled one is not clear. There are even those who poke the jar with a small cone, pour out the good wine, and then fill it with water. Looking at the outside, it is still a flower carving, but it is worth nothing. When storing wine, you must choose a flat place and line it with wooden planks. If it is on unstable ground and shaken repeatedly, it will spoil in a month. Also, avoid living in a damp place, as the taste of the wine will easily change over time. When heating wine, you must use hot water to warm it. Silver bottles are the best for storing wine, followed by porcelain bottles, and tin bottles are the worst. Wine is best when it is first warmed. Reheating it reduces the flavor. If you need to serve guests quickly, warming it over a fire will improve the flavor, but it will be hotter, which is not suitable for the mouth and body." Other anecdotes about wine tasting and miscellaneous stories are recorded in Qing Dynasty notebooks such as "Notes from the Thatched Hall of Microscopic Views," "Suiyuan Food List," "Pure Talks from Returning Home," "Fragrant Records of Orchids and Irises"...and there are many historical materials about wine.

### The Life and Death of Presidents

— Mao Yi

Lincoln was a president who came from humble beginnings. He was born in a log cabin. However, Lincoln was not the only American president born in a log cabin. Jackson, Tyler, Fillmore, Buchanan, and Garfield were all born in log cabins. President Harrison also said in his campaign propaganda that he was born in a log cabin, but in fact, he was born in a beautiful mansion in Virginia.

It is generally believed that Washington was the richest president of the United States, but in fact, Hoover was the richest president. He still has a long-term room in the most luxurious Waldorf Hotel in New York. Although Lincoln was poor, he was frugal. After his death, he left an estate of $110,974. Washington served two terms as president and did not receive any salary. President Van Buren received his entire salary at once when his term expired. Presidents Jefferson and Grant had the most desolate lives and died penniless.

President Tyler died of heatstroke, and President Harrison died of a cold. However, both died in the White House, which can be said to have died in their proper places. Harrison caught a cold when he reviewed the troops at the inauguration ceremony without wearing a hat or coat and riding on horseback. Tyler laid the cornerstone of the Washington Monument in the hot sun, drank some cold milk, and ate a bowl of fresh berries. The heat was oppressive, and he was careless with his diet, so he became ill after returning to the White House.

### A Fragmented Description of Spring Feelings

— Liu Yun

In March, in the south of the Yangtze River, the orioles are flying and the grass is sprouting. Confined to the city, working laboriously at my desk, I have no chance to enjoy an outing in the countryside, and I feel very uneasy. The beautiful spring days are wasted idly, and my spirit is greatly damaged. I happened to read Weng's "Daily Lessons in the Flowers" from West Lake, which says:

"Get up in the morning and order osmanthus soup, instruct the servant to sweep the winding paths through the flowers, read the flower calendar, protect the moss on the steps, take the rose dew from the courtyard in the morning, burn the yu rui incense, and read the red and green characters; at noon, pick bamboo shoots and ferns, serve sesame seeds, and draw spring water to taste new tea; in the afternoon, ride a gentle horse, holding a pair of scissors as a whip, and carry a flagon of wine and two oranges, go to listen to the orioles; sit in front of the willow wind at dusk, tear five-colored paper, and freely chant poems; return along the path in the evening, instruct the gardener to take care of the flowers, feed the cranes, and raise the fish."

Reading this, my heart feels open and happy, and I yearn for it endlessly. The daily lessons in the flowers are nothing less than the life of an immortal. However, this is truly the leisure of a hermit in a prosperous age, a refined matter of peace. A thought suddenly returns, adding a bit of melancholy for the past.

### Tolstoy and Turgenev's Duel

— Eastern

Tolstoy was ten years younger than Turgenev, but after his magnum opus "War and Peace" was published, his literary fame far surpassed Turgenev's, so disagreements often arose between them. Of course, the cause of these disagreements between the two great writers stemmed from their different innate temperaments, not from jealousy.

Once, they both visited a friend together. During the gathering, they discussed the education of Turgenev's adopted daughter. Turgenev tried his best to praise the virtue and excellent educational methods of his English governess, and said, "She also advised my daughter to mend clothes for the poor with her own hands."

But Tolstoy believed that being educated by foreigners to the point of almost forgetting one's own language was detestable. He said, "I think it is dishonest for a girl to dress herself up beautifully while holding ragged clothes in her hands; this behavior is like a farce on stage."

"So, do you think my way of educating my daughter is bad?" Turgenev said angrily.

"That statement is consistent with your words and actions," Tolstoy replied calmly.

"If you say that again, I'll smash your head!" Turgenev said in a rage, and then ran away quickly, and the banquet ended unhappily.

On the way back, Tolstoy wrote a letter to Turgenev asking him to apologize. The delay in the reply made Tolstoy even angrier, so he sent a duel challenge to Turgenev, but Turgenev's reply was not received until later.

This furious duel ultimately did not materialize due to the delay in delivering the letters. This incident occurred in 1861. In less than four months, Tolstoy regretted this unpleasant matter. At this time, due to Turgenev's residence in Paris, the two great writers did not reconcile and become as good as before until 1878.

### Carefree Flower (119)

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Fourteen: Roaming on the Sea (29)

Zhu Zhai looked at this Han Yu, who was only in her twenties. Her face was very delicate, her figure slender. She wore a dark blue woolen robe, white silk stockings, and black leather shoes. She wore no makeup on her face, and her manner was refined and generous. Zhu Zhai quickly bowed to her. Feng Sheng pointed to her from the side and said, "Han Yu, tell me, do I have a job now?" Han Yu smiled and said, "You can say it's a job, or you can say you're helping me." Zhu Zhai said, "What kind of business is Miss Han running?" Han Yu said, "I have joined with several comrades to organize a small home industry, specializing in the manufacture of soap, toothpaste, face cream, hair oil, etc. In addition, we also make bed sheets, pillows, and children's clothing for home use. All the workers in our factory are female workers, and I have asked Feng Sheng to help me." Zhu Zhai said, "Manufacturing toothpaste, soap, etc. are all specialized chemistry, how can she do it?" Han Yu said, "I asked Feng Sheng to help me with bookkeeping and supervising the general workers, not to make anything." Feng Sheng said, "Did you hear that? I didn't lie to you, did I?" Zhu Zhai sat in the chair, pondered for a while, and said, "Can she handle it?" Han Yu said, "Why not? Feng Sheng is a great help to me. I feel that in this society, both men and women should have careers and work hard for their future. Mr. Xu is starting a business outside, and Feng Sheng is working at home, wouldn't that be perfect?" Zhu Zhai saw their situation and knew that all his plans had failed again, and he sat on the chair without saying a word. Han Yu said, "I also know a little about your past, and I judge from a third-party perspective that you two should be more stimulated, and your careers will definitely succeed in the future. Because life is too ordinary, everything will not be pursued with effort. There must be considerable stimulation, a burst of energy, no matter how difficult the future is, you will go forward bravely. You two are now in this environment, and I hope you grit your teeth and endure the pain, and you will definitely achieve something in the future. If you are reluctant and compromise now, after a while, you will definitely have opinions again. When things break down again, the relationship will get worse and worse, and even the courage to go forward bravely and start a business will be lost. At that time, all hope will be gone." Feng Sheng said, "I extremely agree with Han Yu's view. Zhu Zhai, you don't have to be disappointed. This is our opportunity, and you shouldn't miss it."
