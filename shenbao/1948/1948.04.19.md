All of the more than 2,700 representatives who have registered will solemnly cast their sacred ballots to write this historical event into the history of democratic constitutionalism. After the voting is completed in the morning, the ballots will be counted immediately to tabulate the election results. The election of the President is the most important task of this session of the National Assembly. Therefore, the Secretariat of the Assembly has prepared extremely carefully for this matter. All procedures related to the election process, such as voting and ballot counting, have been established in accordance with the Presidential Election and Recall Law. At the same time, the practical arrangements have also been completed to ensure that the objectives of speed and accuracy are achieved. In accordance with the regulations, six separated ballot-writing areas and twelve ballot boxes have been set up in the venue, all arranged and numbered in sequence. Supervisors will be appointed for the voting and ballot counting processes. The selection of these individuals will be based on the principle of one person per unit by the Presidium. The voting supervisors will be divided into four groups, with the following distribution of responsibilities: The first group will receive the ballots from the Presidium before voting, verify the number, and supervise the distribution of ballots by the ballot distributors. After the voting is completed, they will check the number of ballots issued and the number of unused ballots, and report to the Presidium. The second group, one person per ballot box, will publicly open and inspect the ballot boxes before the start of voting and seal them. After the voting is completed, they will add another seal. The third group will maintain order during voting and supervise whether there are any omissions or illegal activities in the voting process. The fourth group will patrol and supervise outside the venue to maintain order. Secondly, during voting, representatives will go to the ballot distribution point in order, present their representative credentials to receive ballots, and have their credentials stamped. They will then go to the ballot-writing area to select one candidate using a secret ballot method and personally place the ballot into the ballot box. Representatives will leave the venue after voting and re-enter the venue when the ballots are counted. The ballot counting supervisors will be divided into six groups to separately perform duties such as verifying whether there are any invalid ballots in the ballot boxes and checking the number of ballots. These regulations are extremely detailed and have been passed by the Presidium after obtaining consent at the twelfth session of the Assembly on the 18th.

### To Cope with National Mobilization and Suppression of Rebellion: Temporary Clauses Added to the Constitution; National Assembly Completes Second and Third Readings

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The 12th session of the National Assembly was held at 9:30 AM on the 18th. The amendment to the Constitution completed the second and third reading procedures at the meeting and was passed, completing the first major task of the constitutional National Assembly. The Assembly was chaired by Yu Bin from the eighth group of the Presidium. 2,045 representatives were present, exceeding the statutory two-thirds of the total number. After announcing the opening of the meeting, the Secretariat reported two matters: A, reading the minutes of the eleventh session of the Assembly, and B, the Presidium reporting the proposed voting and ballot counting methods for the President and Vice President. At 10:10 AM, the discussion of the constitutional amendment began, and the Secretariat read the review report of the first group's review committee. Subsequently, Zhang Yingshu and Luo Wenmo, conveners of the first group's review committee, explained the details of the review committee, and Wang Shijie, representing the Presidium, explained the procedure for amending the Constitution, outlining several points: (1) The temporary clauses have a limited duration and do not require constitutional amendment, and are relatively more convenient. It is hoped that the Assembly can pass them in accordance with the constitutional amendment procedure. (2) There are precedents in various countries. (3) They are subject to the control of the National Assembly, protecting civil rights. (4) The original intention of the clauses was to cope with the needs of suppressing the rebellion, and anyone who can lead the suppression of the rebellion should be trusted. Subsequently, Tian Zhiping, Jia Yongxiang, and others spoke. Tian Zhiping believed that the National Assembly must have a spirit of abiding by the law and democracy, but the chairman did not allow him to speak during the review committee, and this review report was not a summary of everyone's opinions. Moreover, the temporary clauses were proposed by 771 people, so how can the amendment opinions proposed by a minority of people change the proposal of the majority? Jia Yongxiang also stated that he did not have the opportunity to speak during the review committee, believing that the chairman of the review committee was undemocratic. Pan Gongzhan then discussed the case, proposing two textual amendments. That is, the constitutional amendment proposal of this session of the National Assembly has not yet been submitted for discussion, but is still under review. Therefore, the textual part of the temporary clauses should be clearly pointed out, on the one hand, to give this session a clear explanation, and at the same time, to explain that the constitutional amendment proposal will be discussed at the next session. Finally, he explained that he agreed with amendment one in the review report. After a 15-minute break, the Assembly resumed. Liu and others spoke in succession. Liu agreed with this amendment, specifically emphasizing the importance of suppressing the rebellion. At 11:30 AM, the chairman declared that both positive and negative opinions had been expressed, and immediately began the second reading. The Secretary-General read each clause one by one. Those without objection were passed. A small number of people raised opinions. At 12:05 PM, a vote was taken. Of the 2,045 people present, 1,708 voted in favor, exceeding three-quarters. The second reading was passed. The third reading continued, and the entire case was put to a vote. Of the 2,045 people present, 1,624 voted in favor. The entire case was passed without any amendments according to the original proposal (the full text of the review report can be found on the first page of today's newspaper). The chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting at 12:07 PM.

### Wang Chonghui's Remarks: Constitutional Amendment Adding Rebellion Suppression Clauses Sufficient to Ensure Social Tranquility

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] After the National Assembly passed the "Temporary Provisions for the Period of National Mobilization and Suppression of Rebellion" constitutional amendment on the afternoon of the 18th, Dr. Wang Chonghui, an authority on law, gave an exclusive interview to reporters from this newspaper: "Our country's constitution provides thorough protection of the people's rights, comparable to any advanced constitutional country. The President and the executive power are subject to the constraints of the Legislative Yuan, which is particularly progressive. However, whether these democratic systems can effectively guarantee national security and the people's interests, or quickly respond to major economic and financial changes during the rebellion suppression period, is uncertain. According to general national practice, in such a serious period, it is necessary for the popular will to grant the government authorities emergency disposition powers. The passage of the temporary provisions allows the President to facilitate the exercise of his powers in accordance with the permission of the Constitution, without being subject to the procedures of the Legislative Yuan at any time, so that the military suppression of the rebellion can proceed smoothly, social order is ensured, and the whole people can reach the seat of well-being as soon as possible. He also emphasized that the status of this clause is the same as the Constitution itself, and only the National Assembly can make the decision to amend or repeal it. The Legislative Yuan can only formulate amendments in accordance with the procedures of Article 174, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution, and submit them to the National Assembly for reconsideration.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Chairman Chiang visited the National Assembly venue again on the 18th, and attended the Assembly for the first time as the representative of the Fenghua County District, sitting in seat number one, using a voting machine, and participating in the voting on the review report of the first review committee.

He used the voting machine three times during the meeting. The first time the chairman used it, he looked around for where the button was, not knowing where it was located. Bai Chongxi, who was behind him, told him it was on the right hand side of the seat. The chairman pressed it and smiled. The chairman agreed with the original proposal for both the second and third readings of the review report. The chairman left after the meeting was adjourned. The order in the venue today was the best ever seen during the deliberations.

Regarding the issue of the Vice Presidential candidate, in terms of the practice of democratic countries, the President and Vice President must belong to the same party. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is the Director-General of the Kuomintang, and there are already several Kuomintang members running for Vice President. Our Party believes that there is no need to run for President, therefore, our Party has decided not to nominate a Vice Presidential candidate."

### Anhui Students Petition: Demand Government Replace Li Pinxian; Clashes with Police on Way to National Assembly Hall

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] More than 100 Anhui students from universities and middle schools in Nanjing, Shanghai, Anqing, and other places went to the National Assembly again at around 10:00 AM on the 18th to petition for the government to replace Li Pinxian, the chairman of the province. The police stopped them near the Paifang, but the students formed a team and rushed forward. At 10:40 AM, the police tried to stop the students from advancing, leading to a clash between the two sides. Xu Shaojiu, a student from Chengchi University, and Qian Yetong, a student from Central University, and others suffered minor head injuries in the chaos. At that time, the Presidium of the National Assembly had appointed Wu Zhongxin, Xue Mabi, and Hu Jingan to talk to the students. Wu told the students that he would ask the Assembly to recommend the government, but the National Assembly had no power to deal with this matter. Since everyone had expressed this, they could go back. The students insisted on waiting for a solution and knelt down on the street. Wu Zhongxin also knelt down facing the students for 20 minutes. The students asked Wu to stand up, and Wu ordered the students to stand up as well. At that time, the students were still agitated and demanded that they be allowed to shout slogans in front of the Assembly gate before they would disperse. After repeated dissuasion by Wu, Xue, Hu, and others, the students finally appointed ten representatives to the Presidium representatives to explain their views in detail. Wu and others promised to ask the Presidium of the Assembly to report the situation of the Anhui students' petition at the Assembly on the 19th. The Anhui representatives also jointly submitted a proposal to the Assembly, asking the government to replace Li Pinxian and give the students a reply within three days. The students left together at 1:00 PM.

[Our Newspaper, Hefei, 18th] Li Pinxian replied to the three suggestions of the Anhui National Assembly representatives: (1) The Communists have already fled west. The remaining scattered bandits are now being ordered by the Security Headquarters and the Pacification Zone Headquarters to eliminate them within a time limit in order to maintain local tranquility. (2) Once the central security funds are issued, the self-defense special donation will be stopped. (3) The selection of county magistrates has always been based on the principle of appointing capable people from Anhui. In the future, the Department of Civil Affairs and the Personnel Office will pay more attention.

### Signing National Assembly Representative Issue Resolved: Elected Certificates Issued but Do Not Attend Assembly; Eight Representatives Resumed Eating Last Night and Will Be Admitted to Central Hospital for Recuperation Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The issue of signing National Assembly representatives was resolved on the afternoon of the 18th. The solution is: the government will issue election certificates to signing representatives who received many votes but did not attend the Assembly, but they will no longer attend the Assembly. At 4:00 PM, Yu Bin, Mo Dehui, and others called on the Chairman, proposing six solutions and requesting approval. The Chairman agreed in principle, but said that the eight representatives must resume eating first, and then the implementation would be approved.

The fasting representatives immediately expressed their acceptance. At 8:00 PM, representatives Yan Zezi and Zhang Fu and others began to eat thin porridge.

### National Assembly Chronicle: Grasping the Key Points to Complete the Constitutional Amendment

[Our Newspaper Special] From the eve of the opening of this National Assembly to the adjournment of the First Review Committee on the 17th, the main trend among the representatives was constitutional amendment. When discussing the rules of procedure, when discussing the assembly schedule, the representatives fought for the opportunity to amend the Constitution, the representatives asked to advance the discussion time of the constitutional amendment, and even one representative shouted: "We must discuss the constitutional amendment first, then the election, otherwise, after the election is completed, the representatives will disperse, and the number of people to amend the Constitution will be insufficient!" The boos, shouts, disputes, and chaos in the first reading and the two-day review committee had the same purpose: to amend the Constitution. Some representatives held the opposite view, opposing the amendment. Of the six legal proposals submitted, four were minor local issues. Only the proposals of Zhang Zhiben and Mo Dehui were important amendments. Zhang Zhiben advocated increasing the National Assembly's powers of initiation and referendum and that the National Assembly be convened once every two years. Mo Dehui advocated adding temporary clauses for the period of mobilization and suppression of rebellion, giving the President great emergency powers. The review committee used two days and four chaotic disputes to exchange for a comprehensive review report, grasping the key points, accommodating the spirit and substance of the two proposals, formulating four temporary clauses for the period of mobilization and suppression of rebellion, and submitting them to the 12th Assembly on the morning of the 18th. Chairman Chiang first sat on the presidium platform as the chairman of the National Government, and later sat in the representative seat as a representative of the people. He led the silence and order of the whole venue, making the second and third readings pass smoothly in one morning's meeting, completing the procedure of constitutional amendment.

The disputes caused by the constitutional amendment were most severe on the 16th. In the morning, Wang Peiji's "big representatives, small representatives, big representatives represent small representatives signing," and in the afternoon, Tang Zhixian's "blind obedience" caused two uproars. Chairman Chiang's "contributed" opinions to the representatives in the capacity of "one of the people" took effect. Although some people at the review committee finally proposed "talk about it tomorrow," no one insisted on "talking about it again" on the morning of the 18th, nor did anyone support "talking about it again." Yu Bin chaired the 12th Assembly. Among the presidium members, Yu Bin was better at controlling the venue. The Chairman of the National Government was also sitting on the presidium platform while this powerful and loud chairman performed his duties, which made him unexpectedly successful. The report and discussion on the voting and ballot counting methods for the President and Vice President did not cause any disturbances. The people on the platform accommodated the opinions of the people below, that the attendance certificate should not be stamped with a dou stamp. The explanations of Zhang Yingshu and Luo Wenmo, the conveners of the First Review Committee, and Wang Shijie and Wang Chonghui of the Presidium helped the smooth progress of the discussion. When widely expressing opinions, Tian Zhiping again questioned: (1) Why was the draft review report printed in advance? (2) Why did the review report overturn Zhang Zhiben's proposal? (3) The cancellation of constitutional amendments should be decided by the Assembly. Why was it decided by the 263-member review committee? Jia Yongxiang said: "I advocate amendment, but I accept the intentions of President Chiang and will not submit it again." He loudly accused Lin Bin, the chairman of yesterday's review committee, of violating the law and depriving the representatives of their right to speak. When they spoke, some people applauded and some people booed. Pan Gongzhan's specific amendment opinions won the most applause. After the break, Tang Zhixian, Liu Shougang, Liu Jiashu, and Li Zhonglin spoke, but they did not attract much attention.

In order to complete at least the second reading procedure in the morning, Yu Bin decisively announced the cessation of discussion with the voting machine at 11:30 AM, and proceeded with the second reading clause by clause and resolution with the approval of 1,729 of the 2,045 people present. Hong Lanyou was ordered to read the clauses. The first clause was calm and smooth, and it was passed smoothly. The second clause was interrupted by Li Hongru, Zhang Jiading, and others, but Yu Bin put their opinions on deleting the second clause to a vote, and only 214 people approved, so it could not be established. The third and fourth clauses were also smooth, and the amendment to the fourth clause could not be established according to law. So Yu Bin used the voting machine again and passed the second reading with the consent of 1,728 people. Some representatives thought that the meeting was about to adjourn and stood up one after another, but Yu Bin declared the third reading without stopping and voted on the proposal as a whole. The colorful voting machines lit up again, and the third reading procedure was passed with the consent of 1,624 people.

The main purpose of the review report was to resolve the constitutional amendment disputes by grasping the key points. In addition to granting the President the power to respond to emergencies, which was unanimously agreed upon, regarding constitutional amendment, it was stipulated in the clauses that it would be discussed at the temporary assembly eight months later. All constitutional amendment proposals were equivalent to being reserved. The only amendment was that the President could not be restricted by the provisions of Articles 39 and 43 of the Constitution during the rebellion suppression period.

The review report was passed at the third reading at 12:07 PM on April 18. The first meeting of the first National Assembly completed the first important task - amending the Constitution. And tomorrow, as Hong Lanyou reported, will be the election of the first President of the Republic of China. (April 18, Nanjing)

### The Situation in Hebei Becomes Increasingly Optimistic: National Army Continuously Recovers Yixian and Anxin; Air Force Flies Over and Bombs the Outskirts of Linfen, Inflicting Heavy Casualties on the Bandits

[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 18th] Military News: The war situation in central Hebei is becoming increasingly optimistic. The National Army in Baoding, in coordination with local forces, also began operations yesterday. At 8:00 PM on the 17th, the Eastern Command launched an attack. At midnight, bandit units from Qingyuan, Anxin, and Shangyang engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army in Anxin for eight hours, after which they were completely annihilated. This morning at 11:00 AM, the National Army, in one fell swoop, recovered Anxin County, and is expected to join forces with the National Army in Renqiu. Thus, all important strongholds in the Pingjin-Bao triangle area have fallen into the hands of the National Army. Furthermore, the Baoding National Army has also deployed offensive operations towards the south and west of Baoding.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 18th] The North China剿匪 Headquarters announced: In coordination with the operations in central Hebei, the National Army on the Ping-Bao Line also launched an offensive on the 17th. At 10:00 AM on the morning of the 17th, Yixian was captured and is currently under attack from three directions. The main force of the National Army in central Hebei is the elite troops of General Chuan’s division and the cavalry of General E You-san’s division. On the morning of the 16th, they advanced eastward from Renqiu, sweeping through the area and seizing over 10,000 tons of grain in Chenzhuang, and destroying a large amount of communication equipment and paper mills. In the past few days, a total of more than 1,400 bandits have been killed.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 18th] Our Air Force dispatched planes on the night of the 17th to attack the bandits on the outskirts of Linfen. When they arrived over Linfen, they discovered that the bandits were using fierce artillery fire from the Dongguan Power Plant and Flour Mill to bombard the city. They immediately dropped bombs, and the bandit artillery fire quickly ceased. Based on the instructions from the ground forces' radio station, they dropped bombs on the bandit positions 700 meters south of the city, and on the bandit heavy weapon positions in Guojiazhuang north of the city and Nanbei Lizun, all of which hit their targets, inflicting heavy losses on the bandits.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 18th] The Defense of Linfen has lasted for more than 40 days. As of now, our city walls still stand firm. The bandit army, disregarding the lives of the people, uses "human wave" and "explosive" tactics. Although they have captured most of the outer strongholds, their losses have reached more than 30,000 people. According to military statistics, as of April 10th, more than 29,000 bandits have been killed or wounded, 61 bandits have been captured, and 2 light cannons, 9 light machine guns, 1 heavy machine gun, 211 rifles, 1 submachine gun, 1 grenade launcher, 792 hand grenades, 72 boxes of explosives, and a large number of other military supplies such as bullets, helmets, and telephones have been seized.

### Editorial: Wishing Chairman Chiang's Election as President

After the National Assembly announced the presidential candidates, voting will begin this morning at 9:00 AM, and the votes will be counted solemnly on the spot. It is expected that by noon today, the first president of the Republic of China will be known. This National Assembly's election of the president is not only the completion of its basic task, but also the first step for our country to embark on the path of democratic constitutionalism. All those who wish to see China peaceful, democratic, unified, and strong attach great importance to this presidential election, and even more, hope that our country's only supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, will be the helmsman of the Republic of China, so that this broken ship under stormy waves can safely reach the other shore. Looking at the general trend and observing the situation in all aspects, there is absolutely no problem with Chairman Chiang being elected as the first president. Therefore, we would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Chairman Chiang on his election as the first president, and to state the great significance of Chairman Chiang's election as president:

First, Chairman Chiang's election as president should not be regarded as a victory for the Kuomintang party alone, but should be regarded as the success of a grand unity of all parties and non-partisans in the country. Chairman Chiang is not only the President of the Kuomintang party, but also the supreme leader of the country. He has firmly stated that he is unwilling to be the presidential candidate of the Kuomintang party, and has never engaged in actual campaigning with the humble demeanor of a great statesman. This is his test of whether the people of the whole country truly support him. However, the people of the whole country, regardless of party affiliation, regardless of north or south, have unanimously expressed their warm support. 2,489 National Assembly representatives have quickly signed Chairman Chiang as a presidential candidate, accounting for almost 95% of the total number of National Assembly representatives. Therefore, Chairman Chiang's election as president today is clear evidence that he is a non-partisan national leader.

Second, although our country's constitution stipulates that the president does not bear actual administrative responsibility, after Chairman Chiang is elected as president, he will still be the supreme helmsman guiding the country onto a smooth path. Everyone knows that Chairman Chiang's great achievements in the past 25 years are unique in our country's history. Even Chairman Chiang's tireless efforts day and night cannot be matched by anyone. Since the Northern Expedition, he has overthrown the warlords and completed unification. He then resisted the Japanese aggressors externally, defeated the Japanese invaders, abolished all unequal treaties, and implemented the full purpose of nationalism. After the victory, he actively promoted constitutionalism. If it were not for the scourge of the Communist bandits, the purpose of the National Revolution could have been fully completed. We also wish that the leader who has worked hard and made great contributions can retire after his success. However, in the current situation, there are many difficulties and crises are lurking. Only with Chairman Chiang taking on the arduous task can the current difficulties be overcome. Therefore, due to the actual needs, Chairman Chiang will still be the supreme helmsman of the country after being elected as president.

Third, Chairman Chiang's election as president is the most reliable guarantee for our country's democratic constitutionalism. Chairman Chiang not only possesses the traditional spirit of ancient Chinese sages and sages, he is unwilling to hold high positions without taking responsibility; moreover, he is rich in modern democratic demeanor, able to tolerate criticism from others on the one hand, and respect the opinions of minority parties on the other. When the National Assembly had disputes over the two constitutional drafts the year before last, the Kuomintang party only had Chairman Chiang supporting the constitution drafted in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. This time, the National Assembly caused a great uproar over the issue of constitutional amendments, and Chairman Chiang was the only one in the Kuomintang party who opposed amending the constitution. Therefore, we believe that Chairman Chiang is the first person in the country who is loyal to the constitution and loyal to implementing the constitution. After he is elected as president, he will undoubtedly add a strong guarantee to China's political progress on the path of democratic constitutionalism step by step. Fourth, Chairman Chiang's election as president is the harbinger of political reform in China. We foresee that after the National Assembly closes, the elected Legislative Yuan will follow up with a meeting. The president will propose candidates for the president of the Executive Yuan, and after obtaining the consent of the Legislative Yuan, the government can be organized. In the future, no matter what internal affairs, diplomacy, finance, and gold are adopted, the public opinion will be the basis. Although the president does not bear actual administrative responsibility, the president is still the supreme helmsman guiding the country forward. We believe that the elected government will be able to change the past habits of incompetence and corruption, and be able to make a fresh start with the people.

We are about to see the most glorious and brilliant page in our country's history unfold, and we would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Chairman Chiang on his election as the first president of the Republic of China!

### Italy Begins General Election

Italy's highly anticipated April general election began voting yesterday. 41,448 polling stations have been set up, all under strict guard by the military and police, allowing ordinary good voters to freely cast their most sacred vote. As of the time of writing, the atmosphere in various parts of Italy is extremely tense, but no serious incidents have occurred. It is expected that this general election will not be disrupted and temporarily suspended. According to the leader of the ruling Christian Democratic Party, Casperi, he believes that the results of this general election will be better than the June general election in 1946. However, the final results will not be revealed until two or three days later at the earliest. All the speculations made by various parties now are inevitably too plain. They cannot be confirmed until the final announcement.

In this general election in Italy, 570 members of the House of Representatives and 237 senators will be elected. The term of office for the members is two years. In other words, the results of this general election will be sufficient to determine Italy's politics in the past two years. In the democratic century, holding general elections in various countries is originally a very common thing and does not require such attention. However, in today's world polarization process, the Italian general election has not only caused fierce competition between the left and right parties in Italy, but also caused the struggle between the two major groups in the international community, shifting the focus of their Cold War to the Italian peninsula.

Looking at the general trend and the situation in all aspects, the results of this general election may allow the Christian Democratic Party to overwhelm the Italian Communist Party and its fellow travelers, and still win the election and continue to be in power for two years. However, the future of the Casperi cabinet is still not optimistic. Because Italy is an island country with a small land and poor people, it relied on overseas colonies before the war, and it could meet its own needs for food and clothing. However, after the war, Italy was destroyed by the war and it was not easy to restore its vitality. Furthermore, all its colonies were deprived of it, and the source of food and clothing materials was interrupted. Therefore, both the country's finances and the people's lives are in extreme difficulty. Under such circumstances, relying solely on foreign aid is not enough to overcome the difficulties. Italy's rebirth still depends on its own strength. The Casperi government has been in power for many years and has no political achievements to speak of, which has greatly disappointed the Italian people. Even if it wins this general election, if it still cannot make full use of US aid as the basis for self-reliance and make Italy's economy revive in the next two years, then the current government will inevitably collapse two years later, and there will be no way to save it.

The characteristic of China's labor movement lies in always cooperating with the national revolution and taking national interests as the premise. In the future, China's labor movement has entered a new stage, and it should also recognize the new responsibilities it should shoulder in the new stage, assisting the country in developing industry and promoting peace. Minister Gu then read the admonition issued by Chairman Chiang, placing infinite expectations on the tasks of the Federation of Trade Unions after its establishment. In his speech, Vice Chairman Sun encouraged the trade union to strive to improve the knowledge level of its members and enhance their skills in order to strive for the status of workers. Minister Gu believes that the development history of Chinese workers is complementary to the history of the Chinese revolution. He hopes that the Federation of Trade Unions will lead the national workers in the future to be the living force for realizing the Three Principles of the People, complete the mission of industrializing China, and make the trade union a general organization for seeking the welfare of workers, moving towards unity and progress. Minister Ma emphasized that Chinese workers should realize their common ideals by concentrating their strength through common organizations, and encouraged everyone to eliminate factionalism and achieve the mission of the labor movement with the spirit of love, unity, and sincerity, and to advocate a democratic atmosphere as a model for national social organizations. Afterwards, all the foreign guests gave simple congratulatory speeches and introduced the general situation of trade unions in various countries. The ceremony ended at 12:00 noon.

### Taiwan National Assembly Representatives Solemnly Refute: Conspirators Maliciously Spread Rumors, No Basis for Trusteeship and Independence

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The Taiwan Provincial National Assembly Representatives Association hosted a reception for the press at the Longmen Restaurant at 3:00 PM on the 18th. Wang Minning, Lin Zhongjian, and others attended to report on the current hopes of the Taiwanese people and to refute recent rumors of Taiwan requesting trusteeship or independence. It was stated that since Taiwan's restoration, the people have rapidly absorbed the culture of the motherland. The Japanese enslavement education policies of the past have left no trace in less than three years, truly reflecting the sincere inclination of the Taiwanese people toward the mainland. However, recently, schemers have fabricated rumors; the so-called "trusteeship" and "independence" claims are entirely unfounded. Yesterday's New Asia News Agency Tokyo 16th dispatch carried a report by the Associated Press, claiming that Taiwanese National Assembly representatives were requesting autonomy, which was published in Tokyo newspapers. This type of news is akin to taking excerpts out of context and exaggerating local details. The autonomy we hope for today is based entirely on the provisions of the Constitution and has no special emotional significance whatsoever. The current situation in Taiwan is in complete agreement with the central government's regulations for implementing local self-governance. We sincerely hope that the central government will issue an official order designating Taiwan as a model province for the implementation of local self-governance, thereby implementing local self-governance at an early date. This is the ardent hope of all the people of Taiwan. In other economic matters, exports of Taiwanese products, such as coal and sugar, are purchased by the competent authorities at low prices, while imported materials, such as fertilizers and cotton yarn, must be purchased at high prices. We hope that this situation can be improved.

### Yiyang Reduces Rent and Interest Case Creates Further Complications: Chen Huimin Searches for Deng's Wife, Meng Zhaoyun and Others Beaten

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 18th] After the murder of Deng Meikui in Yiyang Zhengyan Township, Meng Zhaoyun, Chairman of the County Farmers' Association, and Deng's wife, Chen, came to Changsha to protest the injustice. The authorities promised to ensure their safety before they returned to the county. However, Chen Huimin, an instructor from the county government, searched for Deng's wife in the township and ended up severely beating Chairman Meng and Deng's wife Chen. The news has spread, and all parties are deeply indignant. The reporter specially visited Chairman Wang to inquire about his attitude. Mr. Wang said: (1) The Deng case is complex and purely a result of local factions and has nothing to do with the 25% rent reduction. (2) Protecting the interests of tenant farmers is a fixed policy of the central government. If anyone obstructs or undermines it, they will be prosecuted according to the law. (3) He is very concerned about the beating of Meng Zhaoyun and others, and the situation where the heads of the Farmers' Association in Zhengyan Township were forced to flee to other counties. Those who violate the law will be severely punished. Finally, Mr. Wang expressed deep regret for the landlords' obstruction of rent restrictions.

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 18th] The Hunan Democratic Economic Association is very indignant about the case of Meng Zhaoyun, Chairman of the Yiyang County Farmers' Association, and Deng Meikui's wife, Chen, being beaten. On the 18th, they telegraphed Commissioner Li of the First District, asking him to disregard everything and protect the lives and safety of Meng and others in accordance with the law, and to immediately investigate the criminals and punish them severely. In addition, a senior official of the provincial government wrote to Chairman Wang, suggesting that the case should be taken seriously and not be compared to a trivial spy killing. The county government of Yiyang should be fully responsible for the land reform if it is to be implemented in the future.

Churches in Rome rang their bells simultaneously at 5:00 AM to announce the arrival of Italy's great day. Saint Peter's Square was crowded with zealous Catholics, attending the 8:00 AM mass, praying for the victory of Christian democracy. Tensions were high elsewhere in Rome, but there were no reports of riots. Many transportation workers requested leave to vote, and public transportation was nearly at a standstill. The tricolor flag of the Italian Republic was hung high on the roofs of government offices. Voting was held throughout the day, and the final results will not be officially announced until Wednesday. The Vatican City, located in the center of Rome, ordered its guards to remain on duty in case of emergencies. When announcing the start of voting, Rome Radio said that the time for voting had arrived and that all levels of citizens in Italy knew that voting was their obligation.

A large number of cameras and reporters surrounded Togliatti upon his arrival. Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the right-wing Socialist Party, Saragat, said, "Whether Italy will join Western Europe or become a balancing force will soon be revealed."

### Most U.S. Congressmen Advocate Amending the UN Charter, Proposing a Bill to Abolish the Veto Power

[United Press, Washington, 17th] Sixteen U.S. Senators and fourteen Representatives have proposed that the Soviet Union should be disregarded in world plans from now on unless it is prepared to acknowledge the approval of the majority of nations. If this proposal is passed, the current United Nations will undergo major changes, leading to the Soviet Union's actual withdrawal, or the current United Nations will be set aside, and another world organization will be formed, including only anti-communist countries.

The House plan, proposed by seven members each from the Republican and Democratic parties, will be reviewed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee in late this month. If passed, it will only be an advisory opinion to the State Department and the President. The Senate plan, proposed by nine Republican and seven Democratic Senators, will also be reviewed by the Foreign Relations Committee and is of a stronger nature. It will ask the President to take action to change the UN regulations. In any case, U.S. congressmen have strongly reacted to the Soviet Union's use of the veto power twenty-three times in the past two years, leading to twenty-eight proposals in the House and three in the Senate regarding amending the UN Charter. The House proposals include the following key points: (1) The veto power should be abolished when taking action against aggressors or voting on new members joining the United Nations; (2) The charter should define aggression as a country or its people using armed force against the recognized territory of a member state, or a country occupying territory beyond its borders; (3) It should stipulate prohibited military equipment, such as atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and heavy weapons exceeding agreed limits; (4) The Security Council should set limits on arms production, with the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union each accounting for 20 percent; (5) A world peacekeeping force should be composed of volunteers from smaller countries. In the event of a war of aggression, the five major powers should be allowed to allocate troops to join the world peacekeeping force; (6) If any major power launches an arms race, other countries should immediately establish an international peacekeeping force; (7) The revised UN Charter should adopt the U.S. plan for universal inspection and control of atomic energy; (8) The Security Council should be reformed with two members each from the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, one each from China and France, and two from other countries. Resolutions without veto power should be passed by a majority of six out of ten votes. The majority of House members have stated that they will support this plan.

### U.S. Leadership in Rebuilding World Peace, Domestic Economic Soundness Must Be Pursued, President Truman Appeals to the Nation

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] President Truman, speaking at the annual banquet of the American Society of Newspaper Editors tonight, believes that the world is at one of the decisive points in history. He said that the people of the whole world, after the most terrible war, are now re-deciding the way of civilization, and the United States is the main support for those who are rebuilding world civilization based on democratic and free principles. To enhance the strength of the United States, it is necessary for the whole country to support the anti-inflation plan that he submitted to Congress last November. Truman also said that the United States' assistance to others, although centered on economic assistance, should also be supplemented by sufficient military power so that others may have some sense of security during the reconstruction. The assistance provided by the United States will largely come from American agriculture, industry, and mines. The economic strength of the United States is a prerequisite for maintaining world freedom and peace; otherwise, the United States can neither help others nor lead others.

[Central News Agency, Amman, 17th, United Press] King Abdullah of Transjordan told a United Press reporter that he had specially dispatched Transjordanian troops to Palestine to fight against what he called "the threat of the Soviet Union and the Jews to the Arab world." He said that the critical situation in the area will urge him to actively assist the Arabs of Palestine. He continued, "I deeply love peace and have made efforts to strive for peace, but if the situation in Palestine continues to deteriorate, communism is likely to spread to the area."

Abdullah also said that he deeply fears that after the British army completes its withdrawal from Palestine on May 15, a large number of Soviet troops and weapons will be transported to Haifa, Tel Aviv, and Jaffa, which may lead to another war in the form of the Spanish Civil War, with one side being Britain and the United States, and the other side being the Soviet Union. And this kind of war may evolve into World War III. Abdullah stated that he firmly believed that he could quickly mobilize mechanized Arab troops to prevent the realization of the above possibility. He also said, "If the Jews are rational, the war in Palestine can be stopped immediately." He believes that the current conflict in Palestine between the Arabs and the Haganah is only a "prelude," and the real war is yet to come.

[Central News Agency, Jerusalem, 17th, United Press] Neither the Jewish nor the Arab side has yet shown any signs of complying with the UN Security Council's order for an immediate ceasefire.

### Drug Manufacturing and Trafficking Organization Cracked Down, More Than 200 Taels of Morphine and More Than Ten Jin of Opium Seized, Seven Suspects Arrested and Sent to the Police Department for Interrogation Today

[This newspaper's report] The Gendarmerie Headquarters' Gendarmerie Brigade recently cracked down on a large-scale drug manufacturing organization again, seizing a large amount of drugs, including more than 200 taels of morphine and more than ten jin of opium. The details of the case are as follows: On the morning of the 16th of this month, Chief of Inspection Zheng Zhongwei received a secret report stating that Cai Ziying, a tenant at No. 6, Lane 206, Renchangli, Jinling Middle Road, was suspected of manufacturing drugs. Chief Zheng immediately reported to Commander Xuan for instructions and handed the case over to Brigade Commander Lu Peng of the Gendarmerie Brigade for thorough investigation. After receiving the order, Brigade Commander Lu immediately dispatched Squad Leader Xu Xiaohua of the First Squad to lead a large number of officers to search the address at 3 p.m. on the 16th, and indeed seized three large boxes of prepared morphine, more than ten boxes of raw materials that had not yet been made, and a large number of manufacturing equipment. The principal offender Cai Ziying and suspects Cai Chen Yun'e, Cai Suqin, Shao Huangshi, Shao Yingyang, Shao Yiren, and Zheng Hongwei were arrested on the spot. After interrogation, they confessed that the raw materials for the drugs came from Boss Liu Lao San of Zhen Da Pawnshop at No. 24, Ninghai East Road. Squad Leader Xu immediately led a motorized vehicle team to Zhen Da Pawnshop based on the confession, seized a box of prepared morphine, and arrested suspects Liu Yongji, Chen Yaoshan, Cai Zhenmao, Liu Xikun, and Liu Chuxian. Boss Liu Lao San had fled Shanghai. The gendarmerie personnel then went to Liu Lao San's residence at No. 5, Lane 104, Wangting Street, seized raw materials for morphine and utensils for manufacturing drugs, and arrested a suspect, Zhou Dingren. They also arrested drug trafficking suspects Zheng Zichuan, Zheng Yuqiao, Zheng Ruitang, Zheng Jiazhi, Chen Liangshu, Zheng Renhai, and Zheng Guozhi at Fuli Pawnshop at No. 44, Luxiangyuan Road. After detailed interrogation by the team headquarters, except for Cai Ziying, Zheng Zichuan, Zheng Yuqiao, and Chen Liangshu, who admitted to manufacturing drugs or selling them for smoking, Zheng Guozhi and Zheng Renhai denied it, but according to Chen Liangshu's confession, they were suspected of participating in drug trafficking. Cai Chen Yun'e, wife of Cai Ziying, knew about it but concealed it without reporting it, which was obviously in conflict with the regulations on prohibiting smoking and drugs. The seven offenders were all scheduled to be sent to the Gendarmerie Headquarters today along with the drugs for interrogation. The remaining thirteen people were released on bail after a light investigation showed that they were not involved.

### U.S. Admiral Badger Receives Reporters, The Seventh Fleet's Work in China, Assisting in the Transport and Unloading of Aid to China Materials

[This newspaper's report] U.S. Vice Admiral Badger, Commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, received reporters at the Navy Headquarters at 11 a.m. yesterday. U.S. Naval Advisory Group to China Chief Selber and U.S. Consul General Cabot were also present. During the meeting, Vice Admiral Badger stated that he had come to China twenty-five years ago, and was very friendly with old Chinese Navy generals such as Sa Zhenbing. In addition to naval personnel, Badger had many Chinese friends from all walks of life, so he said that he knew the Chinese situation quite well, sympathized with China, and was willing to help China wholeheartedly.

Vice Admiral Badger also said that the main task of the Seventh Fleet in China at present is to assist in the transport of U.S. aid materials to China, but the unloading work is quite difficult due to the lack of transportation tools such as railways, so the work is not progressing as quickly as expected. The original plan was to unload 8,000 tons per day in Shanghai, but the Shanghai docks can only unload 3,000 tons, and sometimes it is not easy to unload all 3,000 tons. These materials include food, industrial machinery, ships, etc. Because Badger's work requires him to go to various places to command or inspect, his headquarters is located in Qingdao, but he frequently travels back and forth throughout the Pacific.

When asked about the situation of U.S. Marines being detained by the Communists, Vice Admiral Badger said that he was still in contact with the Communist leaders and was communicating with each other by exchanging letters. He hopes to receive a reply from the other party in the next two or three days.

Regarding the 38 U.S. warships that will be donated to China, 28 patrol ships and 6 small auxiliary ships are in the Philippines, and the other 4 are in Florida, but the date of their arrival in China has not yet been determined. As for the Chinese Navy personnel (including officers and soldiers) receiving training from the U.S. in Qingdao, the number has reached 2,800.

Returning to Qingdao Tomorrow

Vice Admiral Badger is scheduled to return to Qingdao on his flagship "Estes" tomorrow morning (20th). Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 p.m., he also held a reception to entertain Chinese and foreign leaders. Mayor Wu and his wife attended.

### Recovery of the Central District Racecourse, The Municipal Government Seeks Reasonable Solutions

[This newspaper's report] Regarding the issue of recovering the Central District Racecourse, the municipal government previously planned to exchange the Jiangwan Racecourse land, and the racecourse general association and other property rights groups requested an exchange ratio of eight to one, that is, one mu in the central district for eight mu in Jiangwan. After several negotiations, the property rights groups have retreated to five to one, but the municipal government believes that it must be exchanged at a reasonable ratio, so the opinions of the two sides are still far apart. Currently, the Municipal Government Counselor's Office is studying the possibility of proceeding with the land expropriation method, but because the racecourse is located in the central district and land prices are expensive, the municipal government is temporarily unable to bear this huge land price, so Mayor Wu is trying to solve this problem under the principle of seeking understanding.

### Restoring the Chunbei Line Ferry, Planned to Expropriate the Zhongfang Wharf

[This newspaper's report] Before the war, there was a cross-river ferry service called the "Chunbei Line" operating between the Beijing Road Bund and the Chunjiang Wharf in Pudong. The service was suspended during the war, which caused great inconvenience to passengers. After the victory, the municipal government immediately planned to restore it, and planned to expropriate the Pudong Zhongfang Spinning Factory (formerly Japanese-owned China Spinning Factory) wharf along the Huangpu River as a cross-river station. The Public Works Bureau was ordered to invite personnel from the Land Administration Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Municipal Ferry Company to conduct a survey. As a result, a part of the Zhongfang Spinning Factory's factory buildings had to be demolished due to actual needs, but it did not affect the factory's business. The municipal government is now rushing to prepare the expropriation plan and construction charts, and will submit them to the Executive Yuan for the allocation of the required land.

### Staff Education Survey Committee, The Work Is Largely Coming to an End, Chairman Zhao Mian Gong Will Return to Beijing After Completion

[This newspaper's report] The Staff Education Survey Committee of the Teachers College of Central University launched a comprehensive survey of Shanghai factories under the China Textile Construction Corporation, and the group survey work has largely come to an end last weekend. The chairman of the committee, Zhao Mian, also returned to Beijing yesterday after completing his work. Before leaving, he told reporters: "This staff education survey work was promoted by the efforts of the committee members, and with the assistance of China Textile, it was successfully completed, which is very gratifying." In addition to the committee members who originally worked in Beijing and have successively returned to Beijing, there are still consultation forms for labor welfare, technical research classes, and advanced training classes that need to be collected and transferred one after another, so some personnel are still left in Shanghai to be responsible for liaison.

### Doubts Arise Over the Extension of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption, The Lawyers Association Requests Interpretation

[This newspaper's report] The Regulations on Punishing Corruption in Special Criminal Law were promulgated and implemented on June 30, 1943, and were amended and implemented on January 1, 1946. According to Article 14 of the regulations: "These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation for a period of two years." It had reached the statutory limit at the end of last year. The National Government issued an order on January 1 this year to extend it for one year, but this matter has aroused suspicion among judicial circles in the city. The reason is that this regulation is not the same as the Regulations on Punishing Bandits. Article 10 of the Regulations on Punishing Bandits has the words "may be extended by order when necessary," while the Regulations on Punishing Corruption do not have this clause. It must be passed by the Legislative Yuan before it can be considered legal. If it is only extended by order, it is inconsistent with the law. If a crime of corruption is committed after New Year's Day this year, it is possible to overturn it and be subject to ordinary criminal trial, which has a very significant impact. The reason why this regulation has caused doubts is that the Criminal Court No. 9 of the District Court recently tried the corruption case of Shen Zongchang, an employee of the Tax Bureau. During the trial of the case, Shen's defense lawyer Xu Jie suddenly raised the above issue and asked for an ordinary criminal trial. The judge was also unable to answer at the time. The outcome is quite noteworthy. It is heard that the city's Lawyers Association also intends to request an interpretation from the Ministry of Justice.

### Fujian Senators Passing Through Shanghai to Beijing, Urging That the Province's Grain Be Exempted from External Transportation

[This newspaper's report] The Fujian Provincial Senate believes that the province's grain prices have risen sharply and the people's hearts are extremely disturbed. Representatives are going to Beijing to request the central government to exempt the province's grain from external transportation in 1947 and retain it for people's food. Li et al. arrived in Shanghai from Fujian yesterday and especially hosted reporters at No. 31, Lane 749, Yuyuan Road.

Grain Prices Soar

According to the discussion: Fujian Province's agricultural products are mostly focused on timber, tea, etc., and grain has always been extremely scarce. In the past, it has relied entirely on foreign rice and grain input from neighboring provinces for supply. After the victory, rural production has not yet recovered, causing panic over the food problem of the province's 12 million people. Recently, the central government telegraphed the province to transport 100,000 large bags of grain from 1947, totaling more than 20 million catties, for external transportation. As soon as the news spread, Fujian's grain prices soared. The grain prices in Fuzhou and Xiamen have always been lower than those in Shanghai, but the current rice price in Fuzhou has risen to more than 6 million yuan per dan, and the rice price in Xiamen has exceeded 10 million yuan per dan, which is more than twice as high as that in Shanghai, and the rising trend is still increasing. It is heard that the city's Lawyers Association also intends to request an interpretation from the Ministry of Justice.

The People's Food Prospects Are Worrying

The Fujian Provincial Senate believes that the source of grain is insufficient and the grain price cannot be stabilized. If the batch of grain is transported externally, the prospects for the people's food in Fujian Province after the end of April will be unimaginable. Therefore, it has telegraphed the central government, requesting permission to pay the price according to the prescribed amount, and the Senate will pay the price in advance, and then purchase grain from other rice-producing provinces to pay as soon as possible, but it was not approved, so the Senate had to send representatives to Beijing to present the difficulties to the authorities and make earnest appeals to the National Assembly. Li et al. left Shanghai for Beijing last night. According to what they said before leaving: this trip to Beijing will strive to the end on the issue of exemption from external transportation.

### Eight Japanese Major Generals Indicted by Military Tribunal

The National Defense Department's Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals has completed the investigation by the chief prosecutor of the tribunal against eight Japanese major generals, and has filed an indictment. The full list of the eight war criminals is as follows: (1) Ryosuke Fukuda, male, 59 years old, from Tokyo, Japan, former Commander of the Japanese China Fleet. (2) Somehisa Ochiai, male, 57 years old, from Tochigi, Japan, former Commander of the Japanese 27th Division. (3) Masayuki Funehiki, male, 58 years old, from Tokyo, Japan, former Commander of the Japanese 64th Division. (4) Genshiro Hishida, male, 59 years old, from Tokyo, Japan, former Commander of the Japanese 116th Division. (5) Seizo Miyakawa, male, 59 years old, from Tokyo, Japan, former Commander of the Japanese 40th Division. (6) Chujiro Miura, male, 61 years old, from Miyagi, Japan, former Commander of the Japanese 69th Division. (7) Toshio Rioka, male, 55 years old, from Tokyo, Japan, former Commander of the 55th Brigade of the Japanese 64th Division. (8) Hachiro Oikawa, male, 61 years old, from Fukushima, Japan, former Commander of the Japanese Independent 83rd Brigade.

### Cases Tried by the Special Criminal Court Must Await Official Promulgation

[This newspaper's report] In order to adapt to the Special Criminal Court during the Suppression of the Rebellion, Mr. Wang Zhennan was appointed as the president of the court in this city. It has been more than a month since then. The organizational regulations and trial regulations of the Special Criminal Court have been passed by the Legislative Yuan for more than 20 days. However, the court has not yet officially investigated the cases. It is reported that the police bureau and the gendarmerie headquarters have transferred 49 cases to the court for investigation, and the number of defendants has reached more than 200. Among them, the defendants in the Dance Chao case and the workers' agitation case in Shenxin No. 9 Factory have been detained for more than 70 days, but they have not yet entered the judicial investigation procedure. The families of the defendants, who may be sentenced to life imprisonment, are quite concerned about this. A few days ago, they applied to the court for retrial, but the application was rejected. It is heard that the reason why the court has not yet started investigation and trial is that although the organizational regulations and trial regulations have been passed by the Legislative Yuan, the National Government has not yet promulgated them for implementation. It is expected that the court will formally investigate and try the cases after the National Government promulgates them for implementation.

### Discussion on Expanding Worker Rationing: Social Affairs Bureau to Convene Meeting Tomorrow

The Social Affairs Bureau, in an active effort to implement expanded rationing, has scheduled the "Third Small Group Meeting on Expanding the Rationing of Daily Necessities for Union Workers" for tomorrow at 3 PM in the bureau's conference room. Representatives from the Central Bank, Central Trust Bureau, Central Cooperative Treasury, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Industrial Association, and General Labor Union have all been invited to attend. It is reported that the matters to be discussed at this meeting, in addition to consultations on the establishment of a cooperative association, include the draft organizational regulations for the "Shanghai Municipal Workers' Daily Necessities Purchase and Distribution Review Committee" and the draft "Detailed Rules for the Purchase and Distribution of Daily Necessities." The meeting will still be chaired by Mr. Zou Jin-kui, the head of the bureau's Cooperative Section.

### Fanzang Temple Fires Tea Servers; Social Affairs Bureau Mediates This Morning

[Report from Our Newspaper] Fanzang Temple, a famous temple in this city, has a thriving business in Buddhist vegetarian cuisine. For business needs, it employs forty-two tea servers. The temple's abbot, Yang Dong, is known for his strict control over the tea servers, requiring a roll call every morning and mandatory chanting of scriptures twice a day. All the tea servers were very dissatisfied with these rules. Recently, the vegetarian tea cook occupational union was established, and all of Fanzang Temple's tea servers joined as members, with their foreman, Feng Xiao-ding, elected as a director. All the tea servers then jointly recommended Feng Xiao-ding to negotiate with Yang Dong, requesting the abolition of roll call and scripture chanting. On February 3, the vegetarian tea cook union held a meeting, and Feng Xiao-ding, as a director, attended despite the abbot's opposition. Yang Dong then claimed that the temple was hosting a banquet that day and all the tea servers should be serving the guests, but Feng did not request leave and left his post without permission, violating the temple's service regulations, and dismissed him. Feng Xiao-ding refused to accept this and applied to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. Section Chief Fan of the Social Affairs Bureau also believed that the reason for dismissal was too far-fetched, and advised the abbot to have compassion and allow Feng to continue working. Regarding Feng's mistake, he was ordered to write a letter of repentance and apologize to settle the matter. However, Yang Dong insisted on dismissing him, so the case has been delayed until now. Section Chief Fan notified both parties yesterday to come to the Social Affairs Bureau at 10 AM this morning for a final mediation.

### Extorting One Hundred Gold Bars: Suspect Shot and Arrested

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon around 5 PM, an incident occurred at the junction of Zhongshan South Road and Jumen Road involving a police officer shooting and wounding a suspected extortionist. The wounded suspect, named Yu Sheng-chu, 41 years old, from northern Jiangsu, sustained a bullet wound to the buttocks. After being sent to Renji Hospital, the bullet was removed and he will be transferred to the Police Hospital this morning. The Lao Zha Police Sub-bureau refused to comment on the case yesterday because they were still in the process of arresting other fugitives. According to reports, the victim in the case, who lives in Deshun Lane, Zhejiang Road, recently received three threatening letters, initially demanding one hundred gold bars, then automatically reducing the demand to ten bars, and arranging to hand them over to a man holding a thermos bottle near the junction of Zhongshan South Road and Jumen Road yesterday afternoon. After the victim reported this to the Lao Zha Police Sub-bureau, they sent officers in disguise to wait in advance. When the man holding the thermos bottle and another person arrived, the officers attempted to arrest them, but the two immediately fled. One of them, who was covering the retreat, was shot down by the police, and this was Yu Sheng-chu.

### Fu Min Company Issues Statement on the Wanli Vessel Accident

Regarding the grounding of the Fu Min Shipping Company's Wanli vessel at Shengshan, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the company's负责人 (responsible person) issued the following solemn statement regarding the accident and current situation of the Wanli vessel: "The Wanli vessel sailed from Tianjin to Shanghai on the 11th of this month and ran aground at the foot of the mainland mountain near Beishengshan on the morning of the 12th. Upon receiving news of the accident, our company immediately requested assistance from the US-China naval authorities and the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, as our company's other vessel, the Changcheng, is an oil tanker and diesel fuel was not available in time, so it could not sail. Since the 13th, after receiving a telegram from Captain Cai of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xilin vessel confirming that all passengers and crew had safely landed,专员 (special representatives) have been dispatched to Qingdao and Tianjin to arrange for all personnel to return to Shanghai, as detailed in various newspaper reports. As for the passengers carried by the Wanli vessel, there is a complete list of names and ticket stubs that can be verified. The vessel is a new ship built in the UK in 1944 and has been in use by our company for only five months. Its operating procedures comply with the regulations of the Maritime Administration Bureau and it has undergone legal inspection and holds a navigation license. It has regularly traveled between Tianjin and Shanghai in the past and is subject to fair criticism. After the Wanli vessel's accident, our company chartered a China National Aviation Corporation special plane, with Manager Yang De-chuan and representatives of the passengers' families flying to Qingdao and then to Yantai to make arrangements nearby, and established reception centers. The eagerness to rescue is a fact. Until recently, we have received several telegrams daily from Qingdao, Tianjin, and Yantai, and some passengers have already arrived in Yantai, which proves that the news of the rescue is constantly coming. Although our company's Changcheng vessel is short of oil, we are doing everything possible to strengthen the follow-up work and will sail directly from Tianjin to Yantai on the 20th to prepare to welcome the passengers back to Shanghai. Fearing that the truth is unclear, we are issuing this account."

### Stamp Collecting is Full of Historical Anecdotes and Facts: Scattered Remnants Worth a Fortune; China's Earliest Stamps Appeared in the Fourth Year of the Guangxu Reign

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Stamp collecting in Shanghai was once extremely popular, but now it is not as prosperous as before. Many people who devoted themselves to the study and collection of stamp anecdotes have mostly given up their hobby due to difficult living conditions. Listening to two stamp collectors casually talk about the historical facts and current situation of stamp collecting really gives one an endless sense of desolation.

The earliest stamps in China appeared in the fourth year of the Guangxu reign. At that time, they were entrusted to the customs authorities by the Manchu Qing government and were divided into three denominations: one fen of silver, three fen of silver, and five fen of silver. The design on the stamps was very simple. The words "大清" (Great Qing) were printed horizontally at the top, with a giant dragon in the middle. The words "郵政局" (Postal Bureau) were to the right of the dragon, and the silver denomination was printed to the left of the dragon. Because the printing technology was not sophisticated at the time, the designs were all manually separated one by one, so the clouds around the dragon's body, the position of the dragon's claws, and the width of the edges were all slightly different. These have become the standards for stamp collectors to appreciate and price them today. The number of these "Large Dragon Stamps" in circulation is limited. Among them, perhaps there are those with blurred printing, interrupted lines in the design, or even slightly short or long strokes in the characters. Stamp collectors regard these as treasures. Each small piece of waste paper is worth a minimum of US$6 and a maximum of over US$500.

Rare and Treasured Old National Stamps

Among the stamps issued in the late Qing dynasty, the red three-fen stamp overprinted as one yuan is now known as the rarest national stamp in the Eastern Hemisphere. According to stamp collectors' research, the total number of these stamps issued was less than forty. Among the forty, in addition to the horizontal printing of "大清郵政" (Great Qing Post) and "1 dollar" being exactly the same, the black "當一圓" (Value One Yuan) overprint in the center is said to be divided into two font sizes, large and small. Stamps with the small "當一圓" are even rarer. Last year, one was discovered in Shanghai, which turned out to be four unused, connected stamps. As a result, Guo Zhi-fang, the general manager of Yongsha, bought it, paying a price equivalent to 30 gold bars. Later, it was confirmed that this stamp was an old item treasured by Divilia, who was the first to design stamp patterns for our country.

At the end of last year, the famous stamp dealer Wu Le-yuan exchanged from abroad for a rare item that stamp collectors dreamed of. That was a five-yuan stamp printed by the Ministry of Finance Printing Bureau in the third year of the Republic of China. The Beijing palace gate design in the center of the stamp was somehow printed upside down. Because it was printed upside down, and because research shows that the total number of these upside-down stamps is only forty-nine, and because one of the forty-nine was destroyed at the time, how could the discovery of one not be surprising? As a result, within a month, it was purchased by someone for a price equivalent to more than ten gold bars.

Overjoyed to Get a Treasure

In the spring of last year, a primary school student in Chongqing used 20,000 yuan of New Year's money to buy 50 of each stamp from half a cent to 20 yuan at the post office's stamp collecting department. Later, he discovered that among them, the two-yuan stamp of the美駧鈔議肢 (US Dollar Agreement Branch) in the 29th year had an upside-down image of the Premier in the center. The primary school student's father had played stamp collecting before and knew that he had gotten a treasure. His joy was truly extraordinary. Later, the news spread, and inquirers flocked to him. Of course, he sold it for a good price, as high as US$600 per stamp. This type of stamp was printed in the 29th year, and the upside-down printing was not discovered until the 36th year. Moreover, the upside-down blue-black color is the same as the color of the upside-down palace gate, so it added a valuable historical story to the stamp collecting world.

The world's oldest stamp is the one-penny black stamp of Queen Victoria's reign in Britain in 1840, but because the quantity is quite large and the circulation is wide, used stamps are only worth US$5, and new stamps are only worth US$35 each.

Rare and Precious Stamps Stolen

Only the one-cent stamp of British Guiana is the rarest stamp in the world. Currently, there is only one known internationally. It is said that a long time ago, it was also leaked from the hands of a primary school student for 1,006 pennies. Later, it passed into the hands of Mrs. Hient, who then sold it to the American merchant Graham for a high price of US$37,500. At the end of last year, Graham's residence was robbed. The thief entered the door, paid no attention to anything else, punched Graham unconscious, and stole this rare treasure. Its whereabouts are still unknown. The composition of this stamp's design only has a sailing ship, 　　　two 　, and no aesthetic appeal, but at the New York American Stamp Centenary International Stamp Exhibition last year, it occupied an unusually prominent and special position, priced at US$50,000, the most expensive stamp in the entire venue.

Several Chinese and Foreign Stamp Experts

China's most recently issued type of stamp is the 5,000-yuan denomination issued on Postal Commemoration Day. It includes two commemorative designs: the right side is a one-jiao stamp commemorating the restoration of the Republic of China, and the left side is a 500-yuan stamp commemorating the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Directorate General of Posts. The earliest and most recent stamps in the history of the Republic of China are included. It is said that the design of this pattern was made by the post office at the suggestion of stamp collectors. Stamp collectors purchase large quantities of each new stamp when it is issued, which is a major source of income for the post office. Speaking of stamp collectors, people easily think of the late President Roosevelt, former British King George V, and British Princess Elizabeth. In fact, several Chinese stamp collectors also have some reputation internationally, such as Zhou Jin-jue, who is over sixty years old, Zhong Xiao-lu, who specializes in modern stamps, Guo Zhi-fang, who specializes in valuable stamps, Zhang Geng-bo, the chief editor of Xin Guang Stamp Journal and Stamp Dictionary, Ma Ren-quan, the general manager of Shunchang Cement Factory, Xu Bo-ming, the general manager of Jiangsu Provincial Bank, and famous stamp dealers Yan Xi-qiao, Wu Le-yuan, and Chen Fu-xiang.

Immersed in it, Forgetting Everything Else

They have almost become addicted to stamp collecting, immersed in it, forgetting everything outside themselves. When they appraise a stamp, the number of stamps issued, the thickness and color depth of the paper, the variant of the characters, and the number of perforations around the perimeter are all standards that determine its quality, value, and cost. The common number of perforations on each side of a stamp is fourteen and a half. If the printer accidentally used another type of perforating machine when perforating the stamps, causing an absolutely small number of stamps to change to twelve or eleven and a half degrees, then that stamp would immediately be listed in "郵乘" (Zhou Fang-hou's stamp collecting magazine), become priceless, and become a famous item that stamp collectors at home and abroad desperately want to obtain.

### Rationing of Japanese Reparations Materials: Preferential Treatment for Factories in the Rear Areas; Earnest Study of Methods

The first batch of Japanese reparations industrial materials has been continuously shipped back to China. The Executive Yuan previously formulated measures for private enterprises to apply for reparations materials, which were originally scheduled to end on March 15. For this reason, the National Wartime Relocated Factories Petition Group sent more than 30 representatives to Beijing three times to petition the relevant authorities. Recently, the group's representatives, Xie Tian-sha and others, returned to Shanghai from Beijing and said: Zhang Qun, Wang Yun-wu, and other vice presidents paid close attention to this matter and submitted it to the Political Affairs Meeting, deciding to extend the application period by one month to April 15. Xie also said: Regarding the preferential payment methods for relocated factories in the rear areas, Zhang and Wang understood the government's orders to relocate when the war of resistance broke out, sent personnel to supervise and guide, and promised to assist in the restoration of factories after the victory, as well as the experiences of relocated factories in the rear areas during the war, whether due to military retreats, enemy air raids, or shutdowns and layoffs after the victory. Regarding the preferential methods for relocated factories in the rear areas, the group's representatives in Beijing, Wu Yun-chu, Li Zhu-ao, Xue Ming-jian, Pan Yang-shan, Li Jian-ting, Tao Gui-lin, and Li Zu-shen, consulted with the authorities in many ways. In view of the government's financial difficulties, they did not request further concessions on the fixed US dollar price, but only requested that the payment be one-quarter upfront and that the original two-year payment period be extended to five years. This proposal was also submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting and handed over to Zhang Jia-ao, Chen Qi-tian, and others for earnest study before being submitted to the meeting again. It is reported that preliminary statistics show that relocated factories in the rear areas have applied for more than 2,000 pieces of this type of reparations machinery.

### Zhabei Water and Electricity Workers Ordered to Cut Off Electricity Beaten

Ding Hui Requests Severe Punishment of Perpetrators

The Shunxing Teahouse on Xinmin Road in this city owes the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company water and electricity bills for three months, totaling approximately 70 million yuan. The company considered the debt a violation of regulations and sent workers Yan San-lang, Zhang Zhang-gen, and others to cut the lines on the 16th and suspend the electricity supply. However, when the workers went to carry out the work, the owner of the teahouse, Chen Xue-qin, ordered the shop assistants to surround and beat Yan and others, injuring them. After learning of this, the company, in addition to immediately sending the two injured workers to the Fourth Hospital for emergency treatment, also sent employees to the Zhabei Police Sub-bureau to send the police to cut the lines again, but they were also rejected by the shopkeeper. The director of the sub-bureau, Zhou Guan-zi, went in person to cut off the wires and stop the water supply. All the workers in the factory were outraged that their colleagues were beaten for performing their duties and were injured for no reason. The industrial union has now submitted a request to the Municipal General Labor Union and to the relevant authorities to severely punish the perpetrators, and Chen is also required to provide guarantees to the workers, it is said.

### General Commodity Price Fluctuation Decreases, Entering a Period of Intermission

Commodity prices fluctuated greatly after the lunar New Year, reaching a climax in the second week of March. The percentages of increase in various commodity price indices were quite sharp, but subsequently, the amplitude of commodity price fluctuations gradually decreased, and the money supply tightened, seemingly entering a period of intermission after the major fluctuations. This state persisted until the first week of April, lasting for about three weeks. By the previous week, namely the second week of April, commodity prices were still very stable at the beginning of the week due to the carry-over from the previous period's weakness. Later, influenced by factors such as the suspension of deferred settlement on the stock exchange, the prolongation of foreign exchange, and the increase in prices of public utilities in this city, another wave of price increases was triggered. Judging from this publication's recent wholesale price index, it increased by six percent in the third week of March, 4.4 percent in the fourth week, 1.9 percent in the first week of April, and 3.19 percent in the second week, which are all relatively stable. The reasons for the slowdown in this wave of price increases and its details have been described in detail in previous issues of this publication.

Last week, general commodity prices, starting from Monday, showed weakness again compared to the previous weekend. However, on Thursday, due to rumors in the market about another prolongation of foreign exchange, there was some stimulus, and general commodity prices slightly rebounded. The money supply remained very loose last week. The unofficial interest rate stood at 2.5 jiao on Monday and Tuesday. After Wednesday, it slightly improved, fluctuating between 2.5 and 2.7 or 8 jiao. Based on past experience, this situation has the potential to trigger a wave of general commodity price increases. However, in general, commodity prices last week were still considered stable. Analyzing the reasons, it is nothing more than the gradual materialization of developments pointed out in this publication's previous issues, such as the success of the U.S. loan, the sale of state-owned enterprises, and the issuance of short-term treasury bills. Specifically, first, regarding the U.S. loan, it has entered the implementation stage since the U.S. President signed the foreign aid bill. The recent contact between our country's Ambassador to the U.S., Gu, and Mr. Kong Xiangxi with the U.S. Secretary of State, and Mr. Bei Zuyi's impending return to the country, all indicate that the U.S. loan mission is about to be completed. Furthermore, looking at the negotiations between Ambassador Gu and the U.S. authorities, it seems that the U.S. loan is still lacking a "letter of opinion" as a formality in its implementation. This formality is one of the conditions stipulated in the U.S. loan plan. The Chinese government will submit its letter of opinion as soon as it receives this notification from the U.S. Department of State. Second, regarding the sale of state-owned enterprises, according to Finance Minister Yu's report to the National Assembly on the 13th, a method for selling state-owned enterprises to enrich legal tender reserves has recently been drafted, allocating assets from the China Textile Company (中紡公司) valued at US$200 million, assets from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) valued at US$100 million, assets from the National Resources Commission (資源委員會) valued at US$50 million, and a portion of Japanese reparations materials valued at US$80 million, totaling over US$400 million. As for the respective units, they are also actively preparing to handle the valuation and issuance of stocks for the allocated assets. For example, the asset valuation committee of the China Textile Company (中紡公司) passed the valuation of the company's assets in Qingdao and Tianjin at its meeting on the 12th (the Shanghai portion had already been approved). The valuation of machinery, power, and buildings is based on the year 1937, and the valuation of real estate is based on the year 1947. The respective figures are as follows: (1) Valuation of machinery, power, and buildings in 1937: Shanghai 91,800,748 yuan, Qingdao 55,123,758 yuan, Tianjin 45,596,708 yuan, totaling 193,521,214 yuan. Valuation of real estate in 1947: Shanghai 20,452,158 yuan, Qingdao 10,319,630 yuan, Tianjin 26,514,390 yuan, totaling 241,355,600 yuan. The valuation of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) is also in preparation. Third, regarding the issuance of short-term treasury bills, the regulations for this issuance were formally passed by the Legislative Yuan on the 15th. According to reports, the main points of the articles are that the Central Bank can issue them as needed by the market, without any limit on the amount, and they can be sold at a discount in the market or redeemed upon maturity. The above-mentioned factors are all major changes rarely seen in the economy since the victory. Once implemented, their impact will naturally be greatly valued. Therefore, under the current circumstances, the market is showing a relatively quiet scene, which is actually due to the fact that major buyers and sellers are all cautious in the face of these major economic changes, resulting in a temporary wait-and-see attitude. In summary, last week was actually a period of temporary tranquility before the storm. In addition, the government made efforts last week on measures related to stabilizing commodity prices, approximately including: (1) Regarding the case of allowing partial opening of self-provided foreign exchange for importing industrial raw materials and production equipment, according to news from the Import and Export Control Commission, this new measure has now reached the decision stage and will be announced and implemented within days. We expect that once this measure is implemented, its impact will not be limited to the import and export industry itself; (2) The government had long ago ordered that public funds of military and government agencies should be deposited in the national treasury. Recently, it further ordered the three banks and two bureaus to transfer agency deposits to the national treasury and to accept inspections by the Central Bank. Therefore, the National Treasury Bureau has established additional revenue and expenditure offices in Nanjing and Shanghai. It is said that the handling is quite smooth; (3) The Ministry of Finance ordered the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau to limit the same-day use of banknotes from money shops (行莊). The intention is nothing more than to delay the rise in commodity prices by reducing the turnover rate of currency; (4) At the end of last year, in order to stabilize commodity prices, the government stopped lending. Later, in order to help industrial and commercial enterprises finance and overcome difficulties, it carried out the purchase of finished products. Now, there are rumors that the Central Trust Bureau is about to auction off the purchased finished products, which is quite thought-provoking for those who hold goods and for the market's floating capital; (5) The rumor of the Food Distribution Committee purchasing food rice is also rampant, with a strong sense of inevitability. On the Food Distribution Committee's side, the purchase is for the purpose of regulating the market, which is certainly justifiable. However, if we look at the entire market, is the state of depression only limited to the grain industry? Here, we recall the fourth major fluctuation in commodity prices after the victory, from the beginning of April to the beginning of June last year, when the overall index rose by 64%. At that time, the leading price increases were goods for compensation, mainly food that was massively purchased. Looking back at the past, how can we not turn pale at the mention of it? We hope that the government will carefully handle this important necessity of people's livelihood.

Under the aforementioned situation of dense clouds but no rain, the general trend of commodity prices last week did not fluctuate greatly, and no new prices were seen. Regarding cotton cloth, such as 42-count Blue Phoenix, it consistently hovered around the edge of 230 million. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell from 4.8 million on Monday to 4.71 million on Thursday, and rebounded to 4.77 million from Friday, with a fluctuation range of no more than 100,000. Regarding grain, Shangbai Geng (上白粳) rice fell from 3.75 million on Monday to 3.65 million on Wednesday. It rebounded to 3.7 million on Thursday due to rain and fewer arrivals. From Friday, due to reports of rising rice prices in the Su-Xi producing areas and rumors of the Food Distribution Committee purchasing again, it rebounded again, reaching 3.85 million in the North Market. The trend of edible oil and miscellaneous grains was roughly the same as that of rice and grain. As for other items such as building materials, chemicals, and metals, only slight rises and falls were seen, and the amplitude of fluctuations was small. The wholesale price index for last week, classified by usage, is as follows:

During the past week in Shanghai, among the five major commercial ports of Guangzhou, Xiamen, Chongqing, Hankou, and Tianjin, the exchange rates to all ports except Chongqing have repeatedly decreased, and the discount in Tianjin has correspondingly increased. This is partly due to the reduction of remittance discounts in Guangzhou, Xiamen, and Hankou, and the high cost of wood in Tianjin. On the other hand, it can also be inferred that the money supply in this city is loose. The increase in the Tianjin remittance discount further indicates the drastic flow of funds from the north to the south. The following is a table of the exchange discounts and fluctuations of commercial banks in this city to the five major ports such as Guangzhou last week:

Day	6 (Previous Week)	1 (Last Week)	2	3	4	5

Guangzhou	170	170	170	120	120	100

Xiamen	200	200	130	120	120	120

### Currency and Finance

(1) Unofficial Interest Rates on Money Supply

Although signs of tightening money supply in this city were repeatedly evident last week, the general market conditions were weak, and the demand for funds was not very urgent. On the contrary, in terms of the supply of funds, the expenditure of the national treasury was as large as before, and the national banks and bureaus had some inflows during the week, but the amount was not large, this is one reason. There were quite a few remittances flowing into this city from various places, this is another reason. Furthermore, the tools that could help tighten the money supply, such as the sale of finished products purchased at the end of the lunar new year last year, the issuance of treasury bills, and the sale of state-owned enterprises, are all still under consideration, this is a third reason. These three reasons cannot reduce the supply of funds in the market. Therefore, the money supply in this city last week generally showed a trend of wanting to tighten but remaining loose. First, looking at the exchange difference of the national banks and bureaus last week, although the total exchange amount of the national banks and bureaus from Monday to Friday was a difference of 10.351 trillion, if the total amount of 8.25 trillion deposited by commercial banks to the Central Bank within five days is deducted, the actual difference of the national banks and bureaus is only 200 billion, which has a very weak effect on tightening the money supply.

As for the unofficial interest rate in this city last week, although there were high prices of 3 jiao on Thursday and Friday, they were not universal and soon declined. Last week, most transactions were done at 2.7 or 8 jiao. As for the interest rates outside the securities exchange, they were generally stable between 16 yuan and 19 yuan, with little fluctuation.

Commercial banks and money shops also saw a mild situation in terms of funds. Although interbank lending was quite active, it was not difficult due to the abundant supply. The clearing houses after number 60 had a total difference of 12.367 trillion from Monday to Friday in five days. Among them, the differences on Monday and Thursday were the largest, exceeding 4 trillion, and the difference on Tuesday was no more than 800 billion. The amount of cash deposited by the money shops to the Central Bank within five days to offset the slips was about 350 billion, which cannot be considered a large amount, and the mildness of the money shops' funds can be further proved.

The amount of difference in foreign banks increased again last week. From Monday to Friday, the total difference in five days was 7.04 trillion, and the amount of inflow each day was over 100 billion, with the difference on Thursday being the largest at 2.272 trillion. It is said that a large part of it was remittances flowing south, in addition to the installment repayments by commercial banks. This is noteworthy.

(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates

Although there were rumors last week that the benchmark rate for foreign exchange would be raised again, the Exchange Stabilization Fund (平準基金會) denied it with emphasis, claiming that "the foreign exchange will definitely not be adjusted again," and the situation calmed down. The U.S. and British exchange rates remained at their original levels of 324,000 yuan and 972,000 yuan, respectively. The Hong Kong remittance also remained quite stable last week. Before Thursday, it was maintained at the level of 100,000 legal tender for 8 jiao and 8 or 9 fen in Hong Kong dollars. The market price of U.S. dollars in Hong Kong was also stable between 5 yuan and 6 jiao and 4 or 5 fen in Hong Kong dollars, which was slightly smaller than the market price of 5 yuan and 7 jiao and 6 fen on the previous weekend.

(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

Although the general money supply was still considered loose last week, there were not many positive factors. The Hong Kong remittance rate was consistently maintained between 8 jiao and 8 or 9 fen. Although there were rumors of an increase in the foreign exchange benchmark rate, the rumors were soon denied by the authorities of the Exchange Stabilization Fund (基金會). Furthermore, the authorities seem to be making every effort to promote the sale of state-owned enterprises. In order to meet the needs of private capital, there were individual sales of units of the China Textile Company (中紡公司), and the finished products purchased at the end of last year were also being dumped. The regulations for the issuance of short-term treasury bills were also formally passed by the Legislative Yuan. All indications suggest that the authorities are quite determined to tighten the money supply. These phenomena undoubtedly added a shadow to the future of the stock market. Major investors are unwilling to increase their investments, and retail investors are also mostly waiting and watching. Although the trend of Chinese stocks last week was still considered weak to stable, comparing the closing prices on Friday of last week with those on Friday of the previous week, some stocks fell by more than 10%. Among them, Yong Yarn (永紗) fell by about 8%, Jinglun (景綸) fell by 10%, China Silk (中絲) fell by 12%, and Xinyi (信誼) fell by about half a percent. All other stocks also showed a consistent softening trend. Even considering the process within the five days from Monday to Friday of last week, although there were no significant ups and downs in the stocks, the trend was weak and lacking in strength.

The trend of foreign stocks was also weak. The amplitude of fluctuations last week was quite narrow. Yisha (怡紗) consistently fluctuated between 2.4 million and 2.6 million. Jardine Matheson and British American Tobacco also only had ups and downs of 20 or 30 yuan. Those in the industry were not very interested, and the reduction in the Hong Kong exchange rate was limited. Although the money supply was considered loose, the interbank interest rate did not decrease, resulting in a decrease in the transaction volume. Other financial commodities consistently declined last week. The stagnation of foreign exchange rates also significantly affected the sluggishness of foreign stocks. However, this latent state is likely to be a short-term phenomenon. After all, foreign stocks are denominated in Hong Kong dollars and are less restricted than Chinese stocks. They are also not affected by inflation, and there will be an unbalanced development in the future. Furthermore, Chinese stocks have repeatedly increased capital, and the number of stocks has expanded, almost rivaling the currency, while foreign stocks have always maintained their original form. Scarcity increases value, and it is also a shortcut for capital to escape. During major environmental fluctuations, it often paves the way for foreign stocks, which should be paid attention to.

### Industrial and Commercial Dynamics

The Sale of State-Owned Yarn Factories in the Cotton Textile Industry's Adversity

On the 10th of this month, the United Press International in San Francisco released a telegram quoting an expert on Far Eastern issues, stating that U.S. aid to China under the Consolidated Foreign Assistance Act was too small to provide long-term recovery. The expert also believed that the value of the Chinese currency would continue to fall and even collapse completely. The conclusion was that even if new currency was issued before the end of the civil war, the prospects were not optimistic. However, we all know that the so-called "suppression of the rebellion" is the current government's established "national policy" and is difficult to change. Moreover, in order to make further efforts, as Finance Minister Yu claimed in his financial report at the National Assembly meeting on the 13th, the government has recently drafted a method for selling state-owned enterprise assets to enrich legal tender assets, that is, allocating assets from the China Textile Company (中紡公司) valued at US$200 million, assets from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) valued at US$100 million, assets from the National Resources Commission (資源委員會) valued at US$50 million, and reparations materials valued at approximately US$80 million, to be handed over to the Central Bank to establish a special account as part of the legal tender reserve. On this new foundation of legal tender reserves, the government can apparently engage in new activities beyond the 70 trillion issuance.

In order to actively promote the sale of state-owned enterprises mentioned above, the Asset Valuation Committee of the Textile Construction Company (紡建公司) held its final meeting at 3 p.m. on the 12th in the company's conference room, determining the valuation of the company's assets in Qingdao and Tianjin. As for the portion in this city, it had already been approved. The valuation of machinery, power, and buildings is based on the year 1937, with a total value of more than 193 million yuan in the three locations. The valuation of real estate is based on the year 1947, with a total value of more than 241 billion yuan in the three locations. As for how to convert the above-mentioned valuation figures into U.S. dollars, the committee proposed two methods for the authorities to refer to. The first is to convert the above-mentioned figures into U.S. dollars based on the ratio of U.S. dollars to legal tender in 1937. The second method is to first increase the valuation figures based on the price index, and then convert them into U.S. dollars according to the current ratio of U.S. dollars to legal tender. According to the central government's regulations, two-thirds of the assets of the Textile Construction Company (紡建公司) will be sold to private enterprises, and one-third will be retained as state-owned. The value of this two-thirds is estimated to be equivalent to approximately US$200 million. If it is sold to private enterprises, it is indeed an unprecedented transaction. It is reported that the equity and property rights of the Textile Construction Company (紡建公司) are being transferred to the Central Bank, which will take over and handle the issuance of stocks or sales in accordance with the methods approved by the State Council. It is reported that the China Textile Company (中紡公司) is scheduled to formally issue stocks on the 15th of next month. The issuance is entrusted to the Bank of China (中國銀行).

Here, we will only discuss the sale of approximately US$200 million worth of assets of the China Textile Company (中紡公司) to private enterprises. In today's situation of general decline in people's livelihoods, the destination of these equity and property rights is noteworthy. If more than half of the equity is manipulated by foreign forces or controlled by a few domestic wealthy capital, it will not only be useless to the general national economy and people's livelihoods, but may even be infinitely harmful.

Considering the capital strength of private enterprises a month ago, it can indeed be said that large state-owned enterprises cannot be purchased by the capital strength of general private enterprises. Furthermore, considering the recent trend of factories relocating south in this city, it is also doubtful whether state-owned enterprises can be successfully sold to private enterprises. According to news from the East China News Agency (華東社), amidst the intense economic turmoil in this city, many industrial and commercial enterprises are relocating south because it is difficult to continue to maintain their operations. Among them, in the case of textile factories, about ten have recently relocated to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and other areas in South China. At the end of the previous week, the Shenxin Yarn Factory (申新紗廠) transported 700 tons of textile machinery to Guangzhou for installation and operation. The agency also reported a conversation with an authoritative figure in the industrial sector, roughly stating that due to the instability of wartime economy, the relocation of factories from Shanghai to the south has become a trend. However, the methods of relocation vary. Although no factories have yet been found to have relocated all of their machinery and equipment to the south, it is heard that some manufacturers are making preparations. Several manufacturers have already relocated partially, and their focus will continue to shift south. There are also some manufacturers who originally planned to transport new machines ordered in the United States to Shanghai for installation and expansion, but have changed their plans to transport them directly to Guangzhou and Hong Kong for unloading and establishment of factories in those areas.

In this case, after private capital purchases state-owned enterprises, it can relocate to South China for development. However, the actual situation is not as simple as it seems. Putting aside the huge costs of transportation and installation, even if state-owned enterprises can be successfully dismantled and relocated to the south, the current situation in South China is no longer what it used to be. The Shanghai Financial Daily (本市金融日報) published a Guangzhou shipping report last Thursday, roughly stating that "most factories in Guangzhou have stopped production because there is too much inventory and it cannot be sold, affecting the sluggish market for industrial raw materials. No one is willing to purchase factory import quotas... Due to the crazy rise of the Hong Kong dollar, which seems to have no end, purchasing power has been greatly reduced. Furthermore, the regulations to prevent floating capital from flowing south (limiting each person to bring 50 million yuan into Guangzhou) have caused customer groups from Hunan, Hubei, Guangxi, and Jiangxi to be afraid to come south for trade in recent months. Import inspections are very strict, and the real flow of floating capital south has not been blocked. Therefore, the funds for commercial turnover have been cut off, making it difficult for all factories to shut down. Guangzhou's commerce is also likely to wither under the storm."

The situation of private yarn factories determines the extent to which state-owned yarn factories can be sold. This publication has previously summarized the severe crisis caused by the lack of raw cotton in the yarn factories in this city. The supply of raw cotton, in addition to relying on the import of foreign cotton, also relies on cotton merchants purchasing domestic cotton from cotton-producing areas. A certain person in charge of the Cotton Merchants' Joint Purchase Agency (棉商承購棉花聯營處) criticized the yarn authorities, so the yarn authorities issued a simplified method for allocating working capital last week. Although cotton merchants say that they are absolutely confident in purchasing cotton, as of the 10th of this month, the total purchase amount is only 30,000 dan, which is far from the original target of purchasing 1 million dan.

Today, when the situation in the spinning and weaving industry has not improved, the government wants to use the sale of state-owned yarn factories as a means to raise issuance reserves to achieve the goal of stabilizing currency value, and private factories want to use the purchase of state-owned enterprises as a means to achieve the goal of wealth accumulation. I am afraid it is difficult to escape the judgment of the American expert on Far Eastern issues quoted at the beginning of this article. If this is true, then it is natural for state-owned enterprises to be controlled by wealthy capital or foreign forces with special backgrounds and special methods. We may as well wait and see for the facts to explain.

### Tungsten Ore Investigation

The Storage, Transportation, Production and Sales of Tungsten Ore

Tracing back to World War I, the urgent need for various rare metals in the manufacture of heavy weapons was especially pressing for tungsten ore. It was discovered that China's tungsten ore reserves were the most abundant. Experts estimate that they account for about 70% of the world's total reserves, totaling 4,170,255 metric tons, distributed in the following provinces:

Jiangxi: 4,000,000 metric tons
Southern: 4,000,000 metric tons
Hunan: 21,400 metric tons
Guangdong: 148,855 metric tons
Total: 4,170,255 metric tons

Recently, tungsten ore with a tungsten content of 4.6% has also been discovered in Suiyuan and Liaoning. Yunnan and Guangxi account for only a small amount, but the exact reserves are still unknown. Tungsten ore is produced from Southwest to Northeast China, with Jiangxi being the most famous.

Jiangxi's tungsten mines are distributed in Huichang, Dayu, Anyuan, Ganxian, Nankang, Longbu, Taihe, Xingguo, Shangyou, and Yudu in southern Jiangxi. Recently, a new tungsten mine has been discovered in Nanfeng County, which is famous for producing oranges. Not only is the tungsten of excellent quality, but its reserves are estimated to account for half of Jiangxi Province's total.

Currently, China supplies 40% of the world's tungsten, making it one of the most important export commodities and a major guarantee for loans from the United States over the years.

Since 1932, the government has been in charge of mining. The highest production volume in the past 15 years was in 1939.

In 1938, China once established a tungsten refining plant in Shangangshan, Ji'an, Jiangxi, intending to refine it, but it was destroyed by the Japanese. To this day, it is still exported in the form of raw ore. Most of it is transported from southern Jiangxi to Hong Kong via the Yuehan Railway, and then transshipped from Hong Kong for export. Smuggling is also common. However, since January 5th of this year, after the signing of the Sino-Hong Kong Anti-Smuggling Agreement, eight major export commodities from China must have China's export documents before they are allowed to be transshipped from Hong Kong for export. Tungsten ore is one of them. From the date of signing the agreement to the end of last month, a total of 23,056 dan of tungsten ore have been exported from Hong Kong. The current price of tungsten in Hong Kong is about HK$300 per dan, worth a total of HK$7 million.

### Ms. Chen Rongtang, Holder of Two National Records, Returns to China: Leads Indonesian Women's Basketball Team to Participate in the National Games

[Special Dispatch from Batavia] Ms. Chen Rongtang, the captain of the Shanghai women's basketball team who won the women's basketball championship in the previous National Games, and a veteran who holds the national record for women's discus and softball throws, is an overseas Chinese from the Dutch East Indies. She grew up in Xijiang, West Celebes. In 1928, she returned from Xijiang to study at Jimei School in Fujian. In 1934, she transferred to Shanghai Dongya Physical Education College. In 1936, she participated in the National Games and won several women's championships, becoming famous far and wide. Her national record for softball throw is 51.53 meters, and her discus throw is 30.055 meters, which are still held by Ms. Chen. In 1937, she returned to Xijiang and married Yang Dielin, a famous hunter and the first person in China to capture a panda alive. When the "July 7th" Incident broke out, she moved to Macau and Hong Kong, and continued to train the women's basketball champion team. In 1941, she returned to Xijiang to visit her relatives and organized the Xijiang women's basketball team, which was powerful and successful. Later, due to the outbreak of the Pacific War, Ms. Chen lived in seclusion in the mountains. After the Southern Islands were recovered, she originally planned to return to China, but she did not make the trip because her husband served at the consulate in Xijiang. She now has two children, but she is preparing to "make a comeback" and prepare for further development in basketball and track and field events. This time, she was hired as the manager of the women's basketball team for the Indonesian overseas Chinese athletes participating in the National Games. She returned to Shanghai with the Indonesian overseas Chinese athletes on April 8. (Reported by Wu Guoqiang)

### Re-telegraph the Joint Logistics Headquarters to Borrow Athlete Dormitories

The athlete dormitories for the Seventh National Games have been arranged by the General Affairs Group to borrow the classrooms of the Aquatic Products Class of the Central Training Corps. Currently, the class needs to wait for the approval of the Joint Operations Headquarters before it can start arranging and using them. However, since athletes from various places will arrive in Shanghai one after another, the entire building of classrooms on the second floor of Yangshupu Middle School at 1465 Pingliang Road will be temporarily used as a place for athletes arriving in Shanghai to stay. However, the school lacks facilities and cannot accommodate a large number of athletes. The Association yesterday telegraphed General Guo, the commander of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, again, explaining that there are no rooms available for borrowing near the venue, and urged the department to grant the loan quickly to alleviate the difficulties of the Conference.

### Jiaotong University Students Fail: More Than 200 in the Previous Semester

[Special Dispatch] The student grades for the previous semester at Jiaotong University have been calculated and announced. More than 200 students failed to reach two-thirds or one-third of the credits and should be held back or expelled according to the regulations of the Ministry. These students gathered to discuss the matter a few days ago and asked the school to relax the handling standards. Their reasons are that: (1) the school's food and nutrition are too poor today, and the efficiency of studying has decreased; (2) generally, it is because the source of economic income has been cut off, and they are working as tutors outside, which affects their studies and is by no means self-abandonment and willing to lag behind. Other students have written articles expressing their sympathy and asking the school to make a wise decision.

### Citizen Writes to the Public Works Bureau: Please Improve Traffic Conditions on Tongji Road

Reader's Mailbox

Editor: I am sending a letter to the Director of the Public Works Bureau and would like to ask you to publish it on my behalf. Thank you very much. The letter reads: "Respectfully presented, Tongji Road, west of Tiantong'an Station in Zhabei, between Baoshan Road and Jiangwan Road, poses a considerable threat to the safety of pedestrians, especially in the morning when it rains, the danger of young students walking on this road is truly unimaginable. I believe that the reasons why this section of the road has formed a dangerous situation are as follows: (1) the road is too narrow (2) there are too many trucks and cars, and they are driving very fast (3) the sidewalks on both sides are only dirt, which is slippery and uneven, making it inconvenient to walk (4) vegetable stalls are lined up in the morning, further obstructing the sidewalks (5) there are many young students coming and going near the school area. Previously, a child was run over and killed on this section of the road, which is chilling to think about. I sincerely hope that you will find a way to improve the traffic situation in this area, and this virtuous policy will be silently blessed by the residents nearby. Sincerely, Citizen Li Shaohong."

### A MIRACULOUS DISCOVERY IN CHINESE BOTANY

— Hu Xiao Zhao

Those who study plant taxonomy always hope to discover new plants. However, since Linnaeus' classification system nearly two hundred years ago, many plants, especially higher plants, have been studied and already have scientific names. Experienced taxonomists can still discover new species, but new genera are rare, and new families are practically unheard of. China, with its vast territory and abundant resources, has a rich variety of plants. Due to the slow development of scientific research, plant taxonomy in China remains extremely important and offers great hope for discovery. Over the past thirty years, under the leadership of experts such as Hu Hsien-Hsu, Chien Chung-shu, and Chen Huan-yong, many new species and genera have been discovered. The collection work in China's vast territory is not yet complete, and the potential for future discoveries is limitless.

The longest-lived and largest plant in the world is the California redwood (Sequoia gigantea). It is said to have several thousand years of history, and a car can pass through its hollow trunk, which shows how large it is. But even more extraordinary plants have now been discovered in China. At first, you might not believe it, but the fact is there, beyond doubt. That is the "living fossil" – the Metasequoia – discovered by Professor Zheng Wan-jun and his team from the Forestry Department of National Central University in Nanjing in February of last year, at the border of northern Sichuan.

The story goes like this: Dr. Hu Hsien-Hsu, Director of the Peking Institute of Botany, based on his long-standing reputation for cooperation with the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University in the United States, received further funding from Harvard last year. He dispatched a collecting team to work in the border area between Sichuan and Hubei. Under the guidance of Professor Zheng Wan-jun, Wang Zhan-jun of the Forestry Improvement Bureau discovered three of these "living fossil" Metasequoia trees. These were the same as the fossils first discovered in Montana, USA, in 1941, and later found on Sakhalin Island and in Northeast China. These fossil Metasequoia trees grew at the same time as giant lizards and dinosaurs, at least 100 million years ago. At that time, the vast plains of the Northern Hemisphere were covered with these Metasequoia trees. Later, due to abrupt climate changes, they gradually disappeared. It is truly unexpected that there are still living Metasequoia trees in western China. This is truly astonishing, a miracle in botany, and undoubtedly a groundbreaking discovery. Professor Zheng sent Assistant Xue Ji-ru to investigate for a second time and discovered another twenty-five of these trees. The collecting team set out for the third time in September of last year, spending three months and discovering a total of over one hundred Metasequoia trees. They are all wild, found on slopes about 3,000 feet high in Hubei and Sichuan. Professor Chaney (Proj. Chaney), head of the Paleontology Department at the University of California, specially came to China from the United States for this purpose, personally went to Badong for investigation, and collected many seeds, preparing to take them back to the United States for sowing. Soon, all botanical gardens around the world will have seedlings of this fossil Metasequoia. Professor Chaney, together with Director Hu Hsien-Hsu and Professor Zheng Wan-jun, conducted joint research on this newly discovered miraculous plant that has lived for millions of years. They have also suggested to the Chinese government to turn the native habitat of the Metasequoia into a national park. The Ministry of Education, Academia Sinica, the Peking Institute of Botany, and National Central University will jointly organize it. This is truly a part of scientific and constructive efforts.

According to preliminary research, this Metasequoia is not only a new species but also a new genus and can even be established as a new family (family name yet to be determined). The Taxaceae family and many cypress species of the Pinaceae family are all derived from this living fossil Metasequoia. The phyllotaxy theories of opposite and alternate leaves in plant morphology will also need to be changed. The tree is about 100 feet tall, with beautiful needles, and the wood is quite soft and grows very quickly, suitable for papermaking. In short, this discovery is too significant and too interesting. It is unexpected that this area of Hubei and Sichuan has been collected by so many Western botanists, who rested in the shade of Metasequoia trees without discovering them. It was left for our own Chinese botanists to discover, and that alone is enough to create a miracle. This is undoubtedly a major encouragement to our young Chinese botanists and deserves to be publicized.

Dr. K.D. Merrill, a renowned figure in the American botanical community, professor at Harvard University, and former director of the Arnold Arboretum, expressed great interest in this significant discovery. He especially congratulated the achievements of the Chinese botanical community, considering China a sacred land for the study of botany. He refrained from presuming to name and describe this new plant, leaving it to Chinese botanists to prepare and publish the paper, because whoever names and studies it will gain immortal fame.

Now that Julian has been honored with this position, his ambitions will develop. There is high hope for the advancement of world cultural, educational, and scientific endeavors.

### METHOD OF MANUFACTURING CALCIUM CARBIDE

— Bao Zhongqi

In a previous article in this publication (Issue 28), I discussed the properties and uses of calcium carbide. Due to space limitations, I did not cover the manufacturing method. I am now writing what I know in response to reader inquiries, hoping to obtain corrections from experts.

In the past, the only method for manufacturing calcium carbide was the electric furnace method. However, due to the increasing applications of calcium carbide, scientists have continuously researched and improved the process. The 1934 edition of "Thorpe's Dictionary of Applied Chemistry" already mentions the direct method. I will introduce these two methods separately below:

Electric Furnace Method Invented in the 19th century, its raw materials are quicklime and carbon (or coal), which are strongly heated in an electric furnace. The chemical reaction is as follows: CaO + 3C = CaC2 + CO

To produce calcium carbide using this method, the raw materials must be very pure and must not contain elements such as phosphorus, sulfur, and magnesium. Otherwise, a small amount of calcium phosphate present in the lime will cause the product to contain calcium phosphide impurities, which will produce the foul odor of phosphine when it comes into contact with water. A small amount of sulfur will also produce hydrogen sulfide with a "century egg"-like odor. Even trace amounts of magnesium will affect the yield of calcium carbide and consume a large amount of electrical energy. Even adding fluorite ore to counteract this series of reactions is rarely effective. In addition, the moisture contained in the coal and the hydroxide in the lime must be completely removed; otherwise, the production volume will decrease significantly. Therefore, the coal used for manufacturing calcium carbide in ordinary industry must first be heated at a low temperature in a rotary dryer. Also, if limestone (CaCO3) is used as a raw material, it must first be treated at high temperatures to remove carbon dioxide before it can be used. (The heat required for the preparation department can be obtained from the carbon monoxide gas generated during the production of calcium carbide.)

To ensure that the reaction occurs quickly and evenly, the raw materials can first be crushed into fine particles, and then the proportional weight is calculated according to the equation and weighed for mixing. Approximately one hundred parts by weight of lime and sixty-five parts by weight of carbon are sufficient. (Note: Kingzett's Chemical Encyclopedia states that one hundred parts of quicklime and seventy parts of anthracite coal are used. If one ton of quicklime is used, one ton of calcium carbide can be produced. Riegel's Industrial Chemistry states that six parts of lime and four parts of coke are used.) According to the results of actual work, four tons of raw materials are required to produce one ton of calcium carbide.

As for the types of electric furnaces, they can be roughly divided into intermittent and continuous types. The early electric furnaces were designed with the calcium carbide solidifying in an iron crucible at the bottom of the furnace. This is the so-called ingot furnace. The circuit is formed by the carbon and iron at the bottom as one end and the vertically suspended carbon rod in the crucible as the other end. When the current is first turned on, an arc is generated between the two ends, and then the pre-prepared raw material mixture is poured in. The materials then begin to react, creating a calcium carbide pool whose concentration gradually increases until the entire furnace is filled with liquid calcium carbide (Note: The original text's description of the degree of calcination is extremely vague). According to Riegel's Industrial Chemistry, the electric furnace is designed with a tap hole at the top so that the molten calcium carbide can flow out at any time. Therefore, the volume of this type of calcination furnace must be extremely large and made of refractory bricks. The liquid calcium carbide is then allowed to flow into a cooling system to solidify into blocks. The calcium carbide produced by this method has a purity of only 83%, with 14% unreacted lime, 1% unreacted carbon, and 2% other impurities.

The temperature for electric furnace calcination is roughly between 2,000 and 3,000 degrees Celsius. From a scientific and economic standpoint, there is no other source of heat that can be used besides electricity.

Direct Method This method involves directly heating metallic calcium and coal in an iron crucible under an argon atmosphere to 1,225 degrees Celsius. This reaction does not have a significant effect below the melting point of metallic calcium—810 degrees Celsius. However, the calcium carbide produced by this method can be as pure as 93%, but it still inevitably has a black color from the iron.

### BE CAREFUL OF ELECTRIC SHOCK!

— You Ding

You must know that there is nothing strange about electric shock. When the human body becomes part of an electrical circuit, just like when you turn on a switch and see light, the result is predictable. Whether or not an electric shock is frightening, voltage is only one factor. Other factors include the nature of the current (AC or DC; if AC, what is its frequency), how it passes through the body, the condition of the body, skin resistance, the magnitude of the current, and the duration of the exposure.

Strictly speaking, only current kills. As for voltage, it is only the main factor when the voltage is high and a huge current is delivered. Sometimes very small currents can be fatal. According to a report by a line inspection engineer named Alfred W. Barber, an alternating current with a frequency of 60 and a voltage of 115 volts and 0.075 amperes (seventy-five thousandths of an ampere) can be regarded as the dividing line between safety and danger. But some people underestimate it to fifty thousandths of an ampere. If the duration of exposure is too long, the situation will be different. A current of only eight thousandths of an ampere can cause extreme discomfort.

The most dangerous is alternating current with a frequency of 50 to 150 hertz; direct current is generally less dangerous than alternating current. The magnitude of the alternating current that the human body can tolerate increases with the increase in its frequency. For example, for an alternating current with a frequency of millions of hertz, the human body can safely withstand three thousandths of an ampere.

Fortunately, the human body is not a very good conductor. If a person's left and right hands are in contact with a power source, the human body can be regarded as a series connection of three different resistances. The internal resistance of the human body is R1, which is relatively small, approximately between one thousand and five thousand ohms. The second is the skin resistance R2 at the point where the human body is in contact with the power source, and its value varies greatly depending on the situation. For example, if you lightly brush over the connector with a dry left hand, the skin resistance can be as high as 250,000 ohms; but conversely, if you firmly grasp a wet outlet with your right hand, the skin resistance can drop to 2,500 ohms.

What enables us to coexist with electricity is skin resistance. Of course, we should take good care of it, because without it, we would almost be gone. Factors that affect resistance include humidity, pressure, contact area, and the duration of the current exposure. Among these, humidity is the most important. Whether the weather is dry or humid is often the main reason why electric shock is dangerous. A slightly sweaty hand can also greatly reduce skin resistance. In addition, when current is flowing, the resistance tends to lose its effectiveness, so the longer the current flows, the more dangerous it becomes.

### ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERIES IN SCIENCE

— Liu Zhusheng

Scientific discoveries often require arduous efforts to succeed. For example, the discovery of "radium" required Madame Curie to extract slight amounts of "radium salts" from tons of pitchblende through multiple refinements, and even more arduous work to discover metallic radium. However, there are also cases where serendipitous opportunities lead to novel discoveries that are readily available. I will cite several examples to illustrate this point:

1. Discovery of Hard Rubber

"Raw rubber" is soft and elastic, making it unsuitable for use. However, when vulcanized with sulfur to form "hard rubber," it is well-suited for manufacturing buttons, penholders, electrical appliances, and other applications. The discovery of the rubber vulcanization method was accidental. One day, a woman named Goodyear was working in the kitchen when she inadvertently dropped a mixture of rubber and sulfur onto a lit stove. She discovered that the soft, sticky raw rubber suddenly became hard and durable rubber.

2. Discovery of Synthetic Dyes

Before the mid-19th century, all dyes were mostly derived from plant-based woad and madder. However, since the discovery of "synthetic dyes" (also known as "coal tar dyes") by the Englishman Perkin in 1856, there have been over several thousand types to date, with a wide array of vibrant colors! Young men and women wearing beautiful clothes should be grateful for this accidental discovery made by an eighteen-year-old while enjoying chemical experiments: One evening, while Perkin was studying artificial quinine, he declared failure. Feeling exhausted, he poured all the used medicinal liquid into a glass bottle. In an instant, he discovered a beautiful color with a black precipitate remaining at the bottom of the bottle. With his keen insight, Perkin immediately realized that the "aniline" (also known as "color essence") he was using could be used to make dyes. He began researching, which resulted in "mauve," a purple dye. From this beginning, it has evolved into the prosperous science of dye manufacturing today!

3. Discovery of Electric Current

—In today's world of advanced electrical technology, the application of electric current is extremely widespread and important! However, the process of its discovery is very interesting: An Italian doctor named Galvani was killing frogs because his wife was sick. His wife accidentally touched the tip of a knife to the nerves on the leg of a freshly killed frog, and the frog's leg suddenly underwent a violent convulsion. Motivated by this, Galvani conducted many experiments to study this strange phenomenon, which he named "animal electricity." In fact, this was the initial discovery of "electric current." Later, through Volta's painstaking research, the battery was invented.

4. Discovery of Oxygen

—Oxygen, which is indispensable for combustion and respiration, was not discovered until August 1, 1774, by the Englishman Priestley. Priestley obtained a large lens with a diameter of twelve inches and focused sunlight on "mercuric oxide" (commonly known as "Three Immortals Pill"), which released a gas. Placing a candle in this gas caused it to shine brightly, which surprised Priestley. This is how "oxygen" was discovered. Not only do historians believe that Priestley did not have any thorough plan beforehand, but Priestley himself also admitted that his discovery of oxygen was mostly due to accidental opportunity.

5. Discovery of Gelatin

—"Nitroglycerin" is prone to explosion during processing and transportation, causing disasters. After the Swedish Nobel discovered that "dynamite" could be made by absorbing nitroglycerin with "diatomaceous earth," its stability increased greatly, but it was not yet perfect. While Nobel was looking for a substitute, he encountered an accidental encounter: One day, Nobel cut his finger, so he took "collodion" to apply to the wound to form an artificial protective skin. The remaining collodion was poured into nitroglycerin, which formed a slurry substance. From this, he discovered "blasting gelatin," whose stability increased dramatically. The world-famous Nobel Prize was created as a result.

6. Multiple Discoveries in the Process of Manufacturing Artificial Indigo

—To manufacture "indigo," "naphthalene," commonly known as "tar oil," should be added to concentrated hot sulfuric acid to form "phthalic acid," but the reaction is slow. Fortunately, an unintentional discovery was made: In the process, a thermometer was used to measure the temperature, and inadvertently, the tube broke and mercury flowed out, and it was immediately found that the speed of producing "phthalic acid" greatly increased. From this, it was known that mercury could be used as a catalyst, and indigo could be manufactured in large quantities.

7. Discovery of Phosphorus

—The German alchemist Brandt once buried himself in experiments, hoping to transform silver into gold using the "Philosopher's Stone." He accidentally obtained "yellow phosphorus" by mixing sand in urine residue and heating it.

8. Interesting Story of the Discovery of the Element Bromine—The German Liebig accidentally produced a liquid that was similar in properties to "iodine chloride." Without thinking, he affixed an iodine chloride (ICl) label to the bottle. Soon after, the Frenchman Balard discovered a new element, "bromine," which was exactly the same as his so-called iodine chloride that he had been inseparable from. In his remorse, he had to admit that the preconceived notion of "first come, first served" caused him to miss out on a major discovery!

There are many historical facts about accidental discoveries in science that cannot be recorded in detail. When an opportunity arises, we should seize it and continue to work hard. To say that a good opportunity is to be expected is no different from waiting for a rabbit to run into a tree stump, and you will feel the same disappointment!

### ON RELEASING HATE

— Jing Wen

Since the beginning of life in our world, it has been a history of bloodshed. Darwin's theory of evolution clearly proves that the history of all living things proceeds in competition. The survival of the fittest is almost the truth of all living things. This is true of birds, beasts, insects, and humans. Even in the plant world, it is impossible to escape this theorem. It's just that the survival competition of plants is more hidden and not easy to attract people's attention.

Those who believe in the theory of survival competition probably do not believe in the religious theory that God created the world with a benevolent heart. Because if there really is such a God, he must be an incomparably cruel tyrant. Because if he still had a few points of compassion, he would never have allowed this world to have a mantis followed by an oriole, a mouse followed by a cat... The natural world that has been admired by poets throughout the ages is actually a demon's cave dressed in splendor.

However, the Genesis theory is just a fantasy fabricated by human beings themselves. The natural world has no such thing as compassion or cruelty, beauty or ugliness, because the natural world has no ideals, and thus no likes or dislikes. All living animals other than human beings belong to the natural world. The iron law of survival of the fittest is only true in the natural world.

Humans, in their primitive stage of survival, did indeed survive under this iron law for a period of time, because at that time, humans' means of conquering nature were not yet advanced, and they could only make a living in the survival competition of natural laws. Even the wars between primitive tribes already contained social causes, but the main reason was still seeking direct survival competition. There were very few that occurred for political reasons. At that time, there was no such thing as war blackmail, and there was no cold war, hot war, nerve war, or propaganda and incitement, which were purely artificial behaviors. The wars at that time did not conceal their predatory nature, nor did they arise from artificial hatred. There was no such thing as doctrines or justice; it was only for the sake of I want to seize your grassland, you want to seize my water source, and everyone is拼命 to fight for survival.

However, the more civilized humans become, the more advanced their means of conquering nature, and the more fierce and cruel the hatred and struggle between humans become. In the short period of the past forty years, there have been two large-scale massacres, and now a third more terrible massacre seems to be approaching. What is this for? Is it for survival competition? Is it the inevitable fate of the theory of evolution?

Everyone knows that all the large and small wars in various countries from the First World War to the present have nothing to do with the direct survival requirements of human beings. Because since the rise of science, humans have long known that the object of their survival competition should be the natural world rather than human society itself. Every step that humans conquer nature is one more guarantee for their own survival. There is no other way to compete for survival other than this. As for the mutual slaughter in human society, it is not only unrelated to survival competition, but it is actually a suicidal act.

In my opinion, the hatred caused by suspicion and jealousy is the main cause of all modern wars. The so-called imperialist wars or class wars, from the economic character of war, although there is a part of the reason, if it were not triggered by the hatred of suspicion and jealousy, judging from the existing production capacity and rationality of human beings, such wars could be avoided. For example, class hatred is entirely artificial hatred. Struggle and slaughter cannot solve this problem, and they can only deepen the hatred and gap between people, and even destroy human conscience and kindness.

To eliminate hatred between people, reason should be allowed to govern emotions first, and all propaganda that promotes hatred should be stopped. Then there is no reason why any major problem in the world cannot be resolved peacefully. But sadly, we often see a group of people who do not wield knives in their hands, but prefer to shout to kill and incite hatred among people for pleasure. Although these people also claim to be anti-Hitler and anti-fascist, in encouraging war and provoking hatred, they are really descendants of Hitlerism.

Before the warmongers lay down their butcher knives, it is hoped that these people, who are also made of flesh and blood, can first release more reason. Bloody rhetoric and hateful curses can be enjoyable for a while, but they ultimately lose the way of loyalty and anger: not to mention that they are harmful to world peace. Since nature has given us a precious life, why not seek the right way to survive and instead want to incite unwarranted hatred?

### Striking and Deceiving

— Nianhong

I don't know why, but the people I used to hate as a child, I now find them not so detestable, and in some cases, even feel a certain fondness towards them.

For example, there was a servant named Afu, a crude and violent man, whom I personally witnessed beating his wife, a gentle and kind woman, with a carrying pole. He drank alcohol, even to excess, but he wouldn't allow his wife to even glance at a mahjong game; otherwise, it would be a carrying pole, fists, or a washing mallet. I remember how his eyes, bloodshot from excessive drinking, terrified me the most in my young heart; and also his pair of fists with bulging blue veins, at the slightest disagreement, it would be "I'll beat you up!"

However, after leaving home for more than a decade and growing up, hearing the news from the countryside that Afu had died brought me much sadness, and I felt that such a person dying so tragically (he died a wandering, poor and sick death) was almost a loss to the world. In my mind now, Afu is no longer a cruel and barbaric man, and the person who makes me feel the deepest pain and abhorrence is a quiet, amiable, and effeminate accountant. Although the image of him in my childhood is not deep, I once heard that he lied to his mother, who was far away in a foreign land, saying that he was unemployed and not sending money.

Striking someone is wrong, but it's much better than deceiving your mother. This isn't a matter of filial piety. If you deceive your wife or son, it's the same. Rather than receiving a letter believing that your son or husband is unable to find a job in a distant place and is wandering and drifting, thus causing anxiety and concern (when in reality, he is preparing to get married or take a concubine), I think it would be better to taste the flavor of the carrying pole, fists, and washing mallet. There are plenty of accountants in the world who deceive their mothers, so Afu can undoubtedly be considered a truly rare and good person.

The harm of opium lies not in its easy addictiveness, nor in its destructive toxins that ruin bones and blood, but in its fragrance. If opium had a nauseating, foul odor, I think its harm would at most be selling it to people who want to commit suicide as a tool for suicide.

A wealthy man who pretends to be a great philanthropist is more despicable than a miser who refuses to part with a single hair. I'd rather like robbers, I like a miser who refuses to part with a single hair, but it's a pity that even robbers and misers are not easy to see these days!

### Traitor's Calligraphy

— Sun He

I don't know if it's due to the influence or suggestion of physiognomy, but many people judge a person by the way they write. It is said that not only can you see a person's fortune from their calligraphy—poverty, success, and longevity—but you can even determine a person's character and whether their intentions are upright.

Whenever my friends say this, I refute them. Yan Song's calligraphy is vigorous and upright. If that theory held true, then he would be an honest and upright man, and seeing his calligraphy should inspire respect. Recently, I saw an album with a postscript by Jia Sidao, exhibiting such an air of squareness and solidity that it was impossible to find even a trace of his rogueishness playing with crickets in Banxian Hall.

I once collected three types of calligraphy: one was Zheng Xiaoxu's clerical script. Zheng's script is like a scattering of celestial flowers, and although its beauty lies in its softness, it is dignified and solemn, not soft and boneless. Moreover, it seems that his calligraphy embodies the grace of Han clerical script, with hardness in the soft lines. How can it not be considered supremely upright and proper! The second was the calligraphy inscribed by Lee Wan-yong, which is orderly and well-regulated, not only possessing the aura of the imperial court but also a cold, stiff formality, almost revealing a righteous gentleman of the orthodox school. The third was a letter by Wang Jingwei, with flowing and clear calligraphy, and beyond its scholarly air, it seems to possess a touch of uninhibitedness. If one judged people by their writing, he would not only be indifferent to fame and wealth but also extremely noble and pure.

These three men were either a traitor who recognized the enemy as his father and sold the three northeastern provinces (Zheng Xiaoxu, the Prime Minister of the puppet state of Manchukuo), or a traitor who personally brought about the downfall of Korea (the Korean minister Lee Wan-yong, who was later ennobled by Japan), or a large-scale dealer of China's national interests. From the calligraphy of these three, the absurdity of the "theory of calligraphy equaling personality" is more than half proven.

Therefore, I thought that in order to make a clear distinction, in order to ensure that every traitor and betrayer of the country who wants to be remembered also stinks for eternity—to show everyone that even a person with great talent and high artistic genius will be scorned by humanity if they cannot cherish their nation, which is also a movement to cultivate integrity. I would very much like to collect the calligraphy of countless traitors of China (and its vassal states) throughout history and hold an exhibition of traitorous calligraphy and paintings. I have already collected Yuan Jinkai's (a minister of the puppet state of Manchukuo) autograph letters, Qin Gui's album, and poetry stationery from Liang Hongzhi, Huang Qiuyue, and Wang Yitang.

### Names

— Daoxian

After the American Civil War, a life insurance company wanted to hire General Robert E. Lee as its president, with a salary of tens of thousands of dollars a year. General Lee told the directors of the company that he knew nothing about the life insurance business and was not worth that much money. They replied that they did not need him to do any insurance; they only wanted to use his name.

General Lee replied, "Gentlemen, if my name is so valuable, don't you think I should be particularly careful about its use?"

As a result, he declined the offer and went on to become the president of a very small university, with a salary of fifteen hundred dollars a year.

### Miscellaneous Poems on the Lake

— Shi Shufan

Su Xiao's Tomb

The old capital was delicate and beautiful, with the breezes of the Six Dynasties. Why isn't Xiling burying heroes? In middle age, I gradually feel pity for Su Xiao. The tomb crumbles in the dust of war, and the tears are red.

Climbing Mount Ciyun

In front of the mountain, the tide strikes the rush sails urgently; behind the mountain, the wind blows and the spring waves rise. Don't say that smoke is easy to release. The birds crying in the rivers and lakes have hungry voices!

Nesting branches divide the dusk with mist and haze, tired feet lean on people, still looking at the mountain. The foolish child on the road hasn't been able to return, and the crows on Mount Ciyun return to their nests.

Hidden flowers and wild grasses are the hair of immortals, purple stones and red mud are ten kinds of elixir. It's difficult for the unlucky to be a investigating official, the heavenly wind blows up and blows back again.

### Valuing Swans, Despising Pheasants

— Wu Yong

I have often thought that wealth, nobility, and longevity are rarely combined in one person; wife, wealth, children, and official rank are difficult to have all one desires. Therefore, those who are over thirty years old and not yet married often lament that they have "no home to return to," while those who are married inevitably complain of the "burden of family life." Families with many children would rather have wealth and no children; while those who are wealthy but still lack offspring see that the poor may become rich at any time and that children cannot be had at will, so they inevitably yearn for children.

People mostly prefer to abandon the near and pursue the distant, value what they have heard of and despise what they have seen, and disdain reality while loving the ethereal. Our valuing swans and despising pheasants is because swans are distant and pheasants are near. The Chinese people value American dollars and despise legal tender, also because legal tender is encountered every day, while American dollars are uncommon. Regarding the puppet currency of the occupied areas in the past, which was originally regarded as worthless, its value suddenly increased greatly a few days before it was allowed to be exchanged for legal tender. This is because it was about to retreat from the realm of reality into the realm of illusion.

In fact, today's legal tender is not as worthless as imagined. According to a report from the Central News Agency on the 8th, Huang Yuanbin, a member of the National Economic Council, said regarding the use of US aid: "This economic aid averages about 28 million US dollars worth of materials per month, which is worth about 16 trillion legal tender at the current US dollar exchange rate. If all of it can be sold on the market at the market price, it would be worth at least 30 trillion legal tender. Together with the Ministry of Finance's monthly tax revenue of 10 trillion yuan, after deducting monthly expenditures, all legal tender can be recovered in less than three months." Furthermore, according to Chairman Chiang's political report to the National Assembly on the 9th, the total amount of legal tender issued up to the end of March was less than 70 trillion, while the government's gold, silver, foreign exchange, and convertible materials were worth a total of 700 million US dollars, more than triple the amount of legal tender, and the recent US loans of over 400 million US dollars to China have not yet been calculated. Based on these two statements, the inflation in our country is not as severe as generally imagined, so why should the Chinese people value American dollars like swans and despise legal tender like pheasants?

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

Listening clearly is a kind of wealth. Those who manage it well become rich from it; otherwise, not only can they not make money, they may even lose money or go bankrupt.

There are only two things in the world that get better with age: wine and friendship.

If you lose one glove, the one that remains seems like it should be even more precious. However, in reality, that one becomes superfluous.

After the wind and rain, some flowers wither; others, however, bloom even more luxuriantly and beautifully.

Yesterday was the most beautiful, tomorrow will be the kindest, and today is the most real. So life is indeed lovely.

Life is a painting, a painting that you paint yourself. It should have color, spirit, and you should be careful and meticulous. Confused children, don't lightly hand over the paintbrush you use for painting to others.

There are only two things in the world that can be renewed over time: love and hate.

Familiarity and fire both cause life to burn and turn into a pile of ashes.

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 14: Carefree on the Sea 230

Seeing that someone was injured, the soldiers in the truck jumped out of the vehicle to check. They saw Zhu Zhai lying on the ground, covered in blood, and already unconscious. At that moment, the local police arrived and ordered the truck to take the injured person to the nearby Chunming Hospital for treatment. The hospital examination revealed that Zhu Zhai had suffered a severe head injury. While treating him, they checked his ID card, which showed that he was a bank employee, and also saw the letter from Fei Xiaobo on his person. They quickly notified them separately. Xiaobo had just returned home when he received the call and was greatly shocked. He quickly took a car to the hospital. At this time, Zhu Qi had been treated by the hospital, and several injections of cardiac stimulants had been administered. Although he had regained consciousness, he was on the verge of death. According to the hospital doctor's report, the concussion was extremely severe and very dangerous, and it was feared that he would not be able to be saved. Xiaobo rushed to the sickroom and saw Zhu Zhai lying on the bed, his hands, feet, and head all wrapped in bandages. Seeing Xiaobo enter, he opened his weak eyes and said, "Uncle, it's great that you came. My spirit seems to be unable to hold on. I have a few words to tell you. My injuries won't last. Don't let my father know about this unfortunate news, and even more so, don't let Qiwan know in the future. I'm very sorry to them, very sorry..." As he said this, his voice grew weaker, and only his lips could be seen trembling, unable to utter any sound. The nurse standing beside him said, "He was just supported by the cardiac stimulant injection. If there is anything else to say, another injection can be given." Xiaobo looked at him, feeling very sad, and shook his head, saying, "His family doesn't know yet. I'll wait until I've notified them." As he said this, he saw that Zhu Zhai's eyes were already closed. Xiaobo covered his face and walked out with tears in his eyes. He quickly opened up Yu Ru and Feng Sheng's address and sent people to deliver the letters separately. After about half an hour, when Yu Ru and his wife arrived, they were too late. Zhu Qi had already breathed his last. Yu Ru and his wife cried bitterly. Xiaobo told them about the situation when he met Zhu Qi in the morning, as well as Zhu Zhai's last words. Yu Ru said in tears, "He said he's sorry to me, but in reality, I'm very sorry to him. If it wasn't for my own selfish ideas and prejudices, going to Qiwan's house and telling her my grievances, Qiwan wouldn't have broken off her friendship with Zhu Zhai midway, and the two of them wouldn't have left. Maybe today's tragedy wouldn't have happened. Because of my personal opinion, Qiwan has suffered a lot of hardship and flown far away. Zhu Zhai's outcome is still death. I'm very heartbroken and regretful! Looking at Qiwan's letter, she is an extremely sentimental person. If I tell her the news of Zhu Zhai's death, she will definitely be extremely heartbroken. I can't hurt her any further. I want to follow Zhu Qi's words and hide it from her forever, so that she can have some carefree years at sea." Xiaobo listened, silently, feeling that Yu Ru's words seemed reasonable and unreasonable, and he couldn't judge.

The End of Carefree Flower

### 

The National Assembly of the capital is a grand ceremony. The assembled heroes and the flourishing and handsome figures on the conference grounds are enough to make even those from remote and barren lands dance with excitement. The "Flowers of the National Assembly" are repeatedly mentioned in various northern and southern newspapers. This is also a common sight in a grand assembly. There are flowers in the city and flowers in the school, and this Western trend has not started today. However, the World Daily's special telegram from the old capital on the 8th said: "Several representatives talked about the backgrounds of the Flowers of the National Assembly, and many were worthy of song and tears. One representative could not help but sigh and recite: 'Since ancient times, beautiful women have often had ill-fated lives.'" Then the history of this flower must be even more special. I don't know what is worthy of song and tears, nor do I know what is meant by ill-fated, but this makes me think of Consort Zhen of the late Qing dynasty, the most ill-fated beauty among the banners, who fell out of favor with the Empress Dowager Cixi. In the year of Jiawu, she was demoted, and during the Gengzi Incident, when the Emperor and Empress fled west, she was ordered to be pushed into a well by the eunuchs. Wang Hanlin (Yan Quan) has a long "Song of the Palace Well," a narrative poem imitating the "Song of Everlasting Regret." The two lines, "Beauty has always been related to fate, yellow furnaces equally cover up favor and hatred," especially sweep away everything and can be called a poetic history. Earlier, in the fifteenth year of Guangxu, the Empress Dowager, considering that the Emperor had reached marriageable age, in addition to selecting Empress Yehenala (the Empress Dowager's niece), also needed to select two concubines at the same time. Therefore, she decreed that "the fifteen-year-old daughter of Vice Minister Changxu, Tatarala, be titled Concubine Jin, and the thirteen-year-old daughter of Tatarala, be titled Concubine Zhen." The poem about palace women says, "In the jade hall of the Emperor's house in those years, palace locusts lined the road, the sound of light carriages. I remember taking the Zhaoyang sisters from the general's residence in Qili." The selection rules only initially titled them "concubines," and later they were promoted to "consorts." Jin was older and very afraid of the Empress Dowager, and dared not show her talent, fortunately, nothing happened. Zhen was quick-witted and capable, and trusted by the Emperor, so she suffered a tragic end. This is one of the most tragic and beautiful pages in the history of the Qing Palace. By the winter of Wushen, both the Empress Dowager and Guangxu had passed away. In the autumn of Xinhai, the Wuchang revolutionary army rose up, and the Qing Dynasty came to an end. The "Song of the Palace Well" ends with four lines: "Heaven leaves old eyes to see the demise, the children's country is just a dream. Only the weeping waters of the imperial moat remain, year after year regretting the vicissitudes of life." Since the Republic of China, many banner people have changed their surnames to Han surnames. Some have taken the meaning, such as "Aisin Gioro," which has the same meaning as "gold," so the "yellow belts" and "red belts" (members of the imperial family and distant relatives) of the previous generation mostly had the surname "Jin." Others have taken the "sound," such as "Guwalgiya," taking the first sound "Gua" and changing it to "Guan," while the first sound "Ta" of "Tatarala" is changed to "Tang." In the past, Madam Tang, the sister-in-law of Puyi, was praised for her calligraphy, and the Times of Books and Paintings repeatedly published her handwriting. According to people in the old capital, she was also a member of Consort Zhen's clan. And many female students with the surname "Tang" in school registers, but who are from the banner, are those who have changed their Han surname from "Tatarala," encountered in the common market, about nine out of ten.
