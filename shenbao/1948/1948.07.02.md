### The Legislative Yuan Opens a Secret Meeting Today to Discuss the National Budget; Commodity Price Issues Will Also Be Raised for Review

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, hosted a reception for reporters at 5:00 PM on the 1st, appealing for their assistance in maintaining the confidentiality of the Yuan's meetings. Sun first stated that the purpose of the reception was, in accordance with the Yuan's resolution, to exchange views with reporters on the release of news from the Yuan, and that there was no other intention, so please do not misunderstand. He then explained that the Yuan was holding a secret meeting in accordance with the law, and that it was closed to the public in order to avoid publicizing matters under discussion that should not be disclosed or were not yet ready for disclosure, so as to avoid negative impacts. Furthermore, the piecemeal release of news could easily lead to misunderstandings. For the sake of national security and social stability, it was necessary to imitate the secret nature of general administrative meetings. The extraordinary meeting on June 24 involved military secrets, and leaks that could be learned by the enemy should be prevented. News that could stimulate commodity prices and harm the lives of ordinary people and the national finances should naturally be avoided as much as possible from being published. He personally believed that secret meetings easily lead to speculation and rumors, causing anxiety, and should be open to the public. It is exceptional for a national parliament to hold secret meetings in peacetime, as transparency in public affairs and winning the trust of the people are fundamental principles of a democratic country. However, if the country is suffering from calamities, secret meetings are necessary for national security. Sun further clarified that the secret meeting on the 2nd was to hear the government's report on the preparation of the budget for the second half of the year, and that this measure was taken to allow the Executive Yuan to speak freely and for the Legislative Yuan to gain a full understanding. He said: Although the meeting is called secret, reporters can naturally know the situation of the meeting, but please keep it in mind for the time being, and report it after a decision is made. At this point, he cited the resignation of former British Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton as an example, pointing out the importance that parliaments in democratic countries attach to budget proposals. In the UK, the budget proposal can be made public nationwide after it is submitted to the House of Commons. However, at the beginning of constitutional governance in China, the Legislative Yuan decided to wait until a resolution was reached before making it public to society, as a measure to avoid stimulating public sentiment and affecting commodity prices during this extraordinary period. At the same time, the issue of commodity prices will also be reviewed at the meeting, and it is hoped that reporters will help to keep the matter confidential. Sun emphasized at the end that the press in democratic countries has a close relationship with parliament, and the development of democratic politics in China especially relies on reporters and members of the Legislative Yuan to strengthen contact and work together. Finally, he accepted the suggestions of many reporters and promised to provide as much convenience as possible for future news coverage of the Yuan.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] The second secret meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 2nd to discuss the central government's total revenue and expenditure budget for the second half of the 37th year. The draft general budget for ordinary departments and the draft implementation regulations have been submitted by the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan, along with policy guidelines, implementation plans, and compilation and review methods. The draft special revenue and expenditure budget has also been submitted separately. Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan will attend the meeting along with Chief of Accounting Xu Kan and Finance Minister Wang Yunwu to explain matters related to the preparation of the total budget. At the same time, they will report on the problem of soaring commodity prices, and Governor Yu Hongjun of the Central Bank has also been invited to attend to answer questions.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Kuomintang legislators held a discussion meeting at the Central Party Headquarters at 3:00 PM on the 1st to exchange views on the general budget to be submitted by the Executive Yuan. Weng Wenhao, Zhang Lisheng, Wang Yunwu, Xu Kan, and others in charge attended the meeting and gave a detailed explanation of the general budget. Legislators also offered some opinions, and the meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.

### Sino-US Bilateral Agreement to Be Signed Tomorrow in Nanjing; Wang Shijie and Stuart Leiden Represent the Two Countries in the Signing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Sino-US bilateral agreement on the principles for the use of US aid funds to China, originally scheduled to be signed on the 2nd, has been postponed to July 3 due to a certain technical issue. Minister Wang Shijie and US Ambassador Stuart Leiden will represent the Chinese and US governments in the signing in Nanjing. Three documents will be signed at that time: the main text of the Sino-US bilateral agreement, the exchange of notes, and an annex. This reporter learned from relevant sources that the content of the "agreement" to be signed on July 3 includes the principles for the use of US economic aid funds of US$275 million, including special construction expenses of US$60 million, and agricultural reconstruction expenses. The agreement also includes a preamble explaining the spirit of the US aid to China bill. The "Annex" includes definitions of certain terms in the "Agreement" and supplementary explanations. It is also learned that since the US Congress passed the Foreign Aid Act, including the Aid to China Act, on April 3, and after the exchange of notes between the Chinese Ambassador to the US and the US on April 30 to establish a temporary agreement, the Chinese government has actively negotiated with the US side to conclude the official agreement. According to the previous Sino-US exchange of notes, July 3 is the final deadline for concluding and signing the agreement. Most of the discussions on the Sino-US bilateral agreement were conducted in Nanjing. The US side changed the clauses in the draft three times, and deliberated on the wording more than seven or eight times. The final draft agreed upon by both sides was telegraphed by the US Embassy to Washington on the morning of June 29 to seek final instructions. However, due to certain technical details, a completely consistent agreement has not yet been reached. However, according to an authoritative observer who spoke to reporters tonight, it is believed that the differences on this technical issue can be resolved within a few days and will not affect the signing on the 3rd.

[Our City News] Lapham, the representative of the US Economic Cooperation Administration in China, flew to Nanjing yesterday morning to participate in the signing of the Sino-US bilateral agreement on July 3.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The President issued an order on July 1: (1) Appointing Foreign Minister Wang Shijie as the plenipotentiary representative for the negotiation of the Sino-US bilateral agreement on US aid to China. (2) Appointing Zhang Hongjun as the representative to the International Children's Emergency Relief Fund meeting. (3) Approving Yu Hongjun's request to resign from his concurrent position as director of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. (4) Appointing Wang Yunwu as director of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

### Hoffman's Remarks

Economic Aid to China Proceeding Smoothly; Currency Reform Can Be Discussed

[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th] Hoffman, the director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, stated that the Sino-US bilateral agreement will be signed within a few days. Hoffman refused to criticize Senator Bridges' criticism of the State Department for allegedly delaying the military aid to China plan. However, he said: Economic aid to China is proceeding smoothly. According to the work of the Economic Cooperation Administration in the first quarter, it is nearing completion. Therefore, Hoffman stated today that the allocated materials not delivered in the first quarter will be automatically incorporated into the second quarter's allocation. The total value of the materials allocated to China in the first quarter was US$36.5 million, but only materials worth US$26.5 million have been delivered to China. It is reported that the materials allocated to China in the second quarter are worth approximately US$80 million. Hoffman also stated that although not explicitly stipulated in the bilateral agreements, the Economic Cooperation Administration has the right to invite countries participating in the Marshall Plan to discuss currency reform. However, the United States has no intention of interfering in the internal affairs of these countries, and is willing to allow them to carry out the currency reform they need on their own. Hoffman said: The position of the Economic Cooperation Administration is the same as that of an investment banker. Therefore, if the recovery work of the recipient country is not satisfactory after the Administration invests, the Administration can stop its assistance or ask the country to correct the situation hindering its development. Hoffman issued a formal statement on the signing of the bilateral agreement, saying: The success or failure of this plan will depend on the efforts of our comrades across the Atlantic.

### US Military Advisory Group Sends a Team to Guangzhou to Assist China in Reorganizing and Training Its Troops; Actual Training Will Be Conducted by Chinese Officers

[US News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] A team from the US Military Advisory Group, led by Colonel Pauling, went to Guangzhou today to begin advisory work on reorganizing and training three Chinese divisions. This undertaking was announced here by Major General Barr, head of the US Military Mission. In addition to Colonel Pauling, the team includes three advisory officers, two soldiers, one engineer, one medical officer, and two interpreters. It is expected that the team will eventually increase to eleven officers and eight soldiers, whose task is to assist Chinese division commanders and their staff in planning all reorganization and training work, and to provide guidance and advice to the staff in training work. US officers will not directly participate in the actual training. The training work will be conducted by Chinese officers at all levels. The first step will be to provide advice on the training of 100 instructor cadres, who will be divided into small arms committees, tactics committees, and other types of committees. After four weeks, these instructors will train a large cadre for a period of eight weeks. Then, the reorganization and training of the divisions will begin, which will take about six weeks to complete. At the same time, the US Military Advisory Group personnel will provide advice on the administration of the division headquarters.

### The Judicial Yuan Held a Handover Ceremony; Wang Chonghui Took Office; Encouraging Colleagues to Work Together to Complete the Constitutional Work

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] Wang Chonghui, President of the Judicial Yuan, arrived at the Judicial Yuan at 10:00 AM on the 1st and formally took office. The former President Ju Zheng arrived at the Yuan before 10:00 AM and waited for President Wang to arrive. Then, in the President's office, they handed over the seal. Afterwards, a simple handover ceremony was held in the main hall, and all staff members participated. After the ceremony, Ju first introduced Wang, explaining that Wang's morality and learning were admired by all. Wang had also served as Minister of Justice, and his reappointment as the first President of the Judicial Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution was extremely appropriate. Wang then delivered a speech, expressing his unworthiness of Ju's introduction, and saying that he would continue to ask Ju for guidance at any time. He continued: The current situation is difficult, and constitutional governance and suppression of the rebellion are proceeding simultaneously. He hoped that everyone would work hard for the country to complete the work of suppressing the rebellion and implementing the Constitution. After the ceremony, Wang sent Ju to the door, and all staff members also sent him to the door. Wang then went to his office to begin his duties.

Wang's Remarks

Wang received reporters at his official residence at 5:00 PM and spoke freely about the powers of the Judicial Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution and the interpretation of the Constitution. He first stated that the functions of the Judicial Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution should focus on promoting the rule of law. The most important aspect of the rule of law is compliance with the law, which should be the case for both the government and the people. Second, the laws and regulations should be simplified. It is necessary to sort out any conflicting or overlapping laws and regulations, or those that are not working smoothly. Regarding the interpretation of the Constitution, this work is not easy, because China's Constitution is a system between the British and American constitutions, and the interpretation will be quite difficult. As for the interpretation of the Constitution, it is based on a specific problem that has already occurred, because the Judicial Yuan is not a constitutional research institute. As for who can submit this specific fact to request interpretation, it can be submitted by the agency. The procedure for interpretation will be decided after a meeting of the Grand Justices. When reporters asked if the Judicial Yuan can propose remedial measures after interpreting the Constitution and finding loopholes in it, Wang said: No, the Judicial Yuan is only responsible for interpretation and cannot amend the Constitution. When loopholes or other problems are found, it can only interpret them. Finally, when reporters asked about the party affiliation of the Grand Justices, Wang explained from a personal point of view that judges focus on fair execution and do not value party relations, so (1) they do not have to leave their party affiliation, (2) they cannot participate in party organizations, and (3) they should execute their duties fairly and impartially, and not based on party principles. Wang said: The spirit of the Grand Justices being above party affiliation lies in this, but this is his personal opinion.

### Proposal to Urge the Government to Conclude a Peace Treaty with Japan; The Control Yuan Decided to Hand It Over for Review; The Drafting Committee for Review Rules Continued Its Meeting Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 1st] The Control Yuan held its fifteenth meeting at 9:30 AM on the morning of the 1st, attended by 112 Control Committee members and chaired by Yu Youren.

Then, the agenda items were discussed. The item discussed today was still the "Proposal to Urge the Government to Conclude a Peace Treaty with Japan as soon as possible" proposed by Committee Member Zou Lu and others. Many people spoke, and most of the committee members believed that the nature of the case was important and involved various diplomatic and political issues, and should be carefully considered and handed over for review. They all said: Standing in the position of the people, they feel that a peace treaty with Japan should be completed as soon as possible, so that there is something to follow in the attitude towards Japan. This case is not forcing the government to handle it, but promoting the government to complete a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible. Others believe that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has handled it improperly, and that our lenient attitude towards Japan has instead been used by the United States to curry favor. However, in general, all the committee members felt that the matter should be carefully considered from the standpoint of the country and handed over for review. Although Zou Lu explained again that this was only to promote the early signing of a peace treaty so that the policy towards Japan could be implemented in accordance with the treaty, it was ultimately approved by a majority vote to be handed over for review after it was put to a vote.

[Another dispatch] The fierce battle of annihilation in the Yellow River flood area is taking place today in the Longwangdian, Foshan Temple, and Yuxiangpu areas northwest of Suixian. Today, the National Army in Longwangdian is bravely resisting the attacking superior bandit forces, and the fighting is intensifying. Air force squadrons from the Yellow Sea and East China Sea have controlled the skies over the Sui and Qi battlefields all day long, bombing and strafing to assist in the battle. The dense bandit concentrations around Longwangdian and in Guanzhuang, Xugang, and Taozhugang (east of Qixian) are ideal targets for bombing and strafing. In Longwangdian alone, over 2,000 bandits were killed by bombing. The air support is also providing cover for the outer-line army to launch an encirclement and suppression of the bandits. Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi flew over Qixian at 7:00 PM yesterday to convey the President's order to the ground troops and returned to Xuzhou at 11:00 PM.

[Our newspaper, Jinan, 1st dispatch] From 5:00 PM on the 30th, Taizhou experienced strong winds and heavy rain. Disregarding the adverse weather, the bandits continued to attack the city. Among them, the fighting at the northwest gate was particularly fierce. The National Army blocked the attacks in the rain. The number of bandit casualties was unprecedented since the start of the battle. After 10:00 PM, the rain gradually lessened, but the bandits' charges and hand-to-hand combat continued as before. The artillery fire, although far away in Jining, was clearly audible. The fierce fighting was still ongoing at noon on the 1st.

[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 1st dispatch] The Taizhou battle situation is stable. The National Army continues to defend the strongholds outside the city and is confronting the bandits. (The full text of the "Weekly War Situation" released by the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense is published on page 2.)

### Editorial: The Peace Conference with Japan Should Have Been Held Long Ago!

The Control Yuan held its 15th general meeting yesterday morning to discuss the "Requesting the Government to Promote a Peace Treaty with Japan as Soon as Possible" proposal put forward by 94 members of the Control Yuan, including Control Member Zou Lu. The Control Members spoke one after another, all advocating urging the government to take proactive diplomatic measures to break the deadlock on the Japan issue and promote the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. Amidst the widespread opposition from various countries concerned in the Far East to the United States' support for Japan, the discussion of this issue by our Control Yuan further illustrates the concern of both the government and the public in our country regarding the Japan issue.

Japan announced its unconditional surrender on August 10, 1945, and formally signed the surrender on the USS Missouri on September 2, almost three full years ago. However, the peace conference with Japan to clean up the post-war Far East situation has not yet been convened, and the prospects are still distant and uncertain. The conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan is even more out of the question. Three years is not a short time in terms of time. It is truly an unprecedented strange phenomenon in modern history. A peace treaty cannot guarantee permanent peace in the Far East, but without a peace treaty with Japan, the Far East cannot enter a normal state from a state of war. Therefore, whether it is for the sake of peace in the Far East or for the sake of the interests of the countries concerned in the Far East, it is necessary to convene a peace conference and conclude a treaty as soon as possible. The current stalemate in the Far East is caused by many factors, but the most important one is that the United States and the Soviet Union not only have different views on the Japan issue, but also have their own plans, which has caused the Far Eastern Commission, which is responsible for drafting the peace treaty with Japan, to stall. The division of opinions among the Allies on Japan has, of course, first struck the Far Eastern countries that were invaded by Japan, especially China. Caught between the two poles, we feel the pain of being caught in a dilemma everywhere. Moreover, watching the rapid change in the United States' policy toward Japan and the booming recovery of Japan, how can we not feel fear and deeply worry that Japan's recovery will be a threat to peace in the Far East and the security of our country! Therefore, the recent anti-support-Japan speeches by some people in our society have arisen from this. The unanimous advocacy of our government and the public to convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible to conclude a peace treaty with Japan is also for this reason.

Even if we disregard the reasons for our country's advocacy of convening a peace conference as soon as possible, all other countries concerned with Japan also hope to convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible. Taking the United Kingdom as an example, Foreign Secretary Bevin gave a speech at the Labor Party's annual meeting in May of this year, also requesting that the countries that participated in the Pacific War convene a peace conference as soon as possible to resolve this most thorny issue of Japan. He explained his reasons, saying, "If we want to solve the Far East problem, we should first conclude a peace treaty with Japan." Foreign Secretary Bevin's proposal was not only supported by the British people, but also welcomed by the people of the Far East. Only the United States' attitude is lukewarm, and it still has no intention of breaking the deadlock on the Japan issue. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on May 19, the United States diplomatic authorities believe that the peace conference with Japan may be postponed indefinitely. It is said that the United States believes that it is still not appropriate to convene a peace conference with Japan, and the reasons it holds are: (1) it does not believe that the Soviet Union will give up its veto power; (2) it does not believe that the peace conference with Japan can succeed; (3) most of the eleven countries in the Far East oppose the United States' policy of supporting Japan, and their opinions on other issues are also quite inconsistent. From this, it can be seen that the crux of the delay in convening the peace conference with Japan lies in the procedural issue of convening the peace conference with Japan and the divergence of opinions among the Allies on the basic issue of Japan.

Regarding the former, the United States initially proposed that the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission hold a meeting to draft the peace treaty with Japan, adopting a one-third majority voting system, and no country should exercise its veto power. The Soviet Union was the first to express opposition to the United States' proposal and put forward a counter-proposal, advocating that the foreign ministers of the four powers, China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, draft the peace treaty with Japan, and that the four powers must reach a consensus; in other words, the four powers of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union can all exercise veto power over the peace treaty. The opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union are completely opposite, but in order to convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, our country put forward a compromise plan, advocating that the eleven member states of the Far Eastern Commission organize a preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan, adopting a majority vote; however, any resolution must include the consent of the four countries of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the date of this meeting shall also be determined by the four countries of China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union through consultation. Looking back today, if the United Kingdom had not firmly supported the United States' proposal at that time, the compromise plan put forward by China might have been accepted by both the United States and the Soviet Union. Now, if China and the United Kingdom continue to work hard to mediate the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union, it is not impossible to reach an agreement on the procedure for convening the peace conference.

As for the latter, from China to Australia and the Philippines, all the Far Eastern countries that have been invaded by Japan oppose the United States' support for Japan's recovery. Because the people of the Far Eastern countries, standing on the position of patriotism, even if they can understand the United States' policy toward Japan, it is impossible for them not to oppose Japan's recovery threatening their security. If the United States does not respect their opinions and wishes and allows the situation to continue to unfold, no matter how the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo responds to the anti-American and pro-Japanese sentiment of the Far Eastern countries, it will ultimately not help to clarify the situation in the Far East, and the result will be that the United States' diplomacy in the Far East may fall into isolation. Therefore, even if the United States does not consider its own interests, it should clarify the public opinion of the Far Eastern countries and convene a peace conference with Japan to conclude a treaty, which is the only fundamental solution. As long as a peace conference with Japan is convened in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration, all issues are resolved fairly, and a fair and impartial peace treaty with Japan is concluded and uniformly observed by the Allies; in this way, not only will the United States not be solely responsible for the control of Japan, but the Far Eastern countries will not have conflicts with the United States over the Japan issue, which benefits both itself and others. Why not do it? Please think carefully about this, diplomatic authorities of the United States.

In short, now is the most appropriate time to convene a peace conference with Japan. We believe that our country's diplomatic authorities will be able to take proactive diplomatic measures to promote the convening of a peace conference with Japan; because in the past three years, our country's diplomatic authorities have always paid attention to the development of this issue and have always wanted to promote the convening of a peace conference with Japan. As long as our people seize the appropriate time, follow the path of people's diplomacy, declare the people's will and wishes, and support the government in arguing on the basis of reason, it will not be difficult to achieve the goals of our country's diplomatic policy. On the contrary, if we do not know how to use people's diplomacy and blindly shout slogans, it will inevitably lead to the opposite result.

### Graduation Ceremony for Air Force Academy Students: President Chiang Kai-shek Personally Issued Instructions Encouraging Them to Establish a Model of Modern Air Force

[Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 1st dispatch] The Air Force Academy held a grand graduation ceremony on the 1st, presided over by Principal Hu Weike, and Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou also attended and delivered instructions in person. After holding the graduation ceremony for the 25th class, the completion ceremony for the 27th class, and the commencement ceremony for the 28th class, they visited the campus and held the dedication ceremony for the Jianqiao Road, which was built by the academy itself. The activities, including sports and a performance of the play "Heavenly Kingdom Spring and Autumn," did not end until late at night.

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 1st dispatch] President Chiang Kai-shek specially issued the following instructions to the graduating students of the 25th class of the Air Force Academy: Today, students, you have completed your final course of study. At a time when national construction is important, you will surely make significant contributions to the country in the future. In addition to being pleased, Zhongzheng would like to offer a few points to encourage you: First, you should recognize the responsibility of building the army and building the country. During the most difficult period of the War of Resistance, you students responded to the call of young people to join the army and voluntarily enlisted for training. Your ambitions were very grand, aiming to build the nation through revolution. The first step must be to build the army to ensure the victory of the War of Resistance. Now that the War of Resistance has ended for three years, the communist bandits' rebellion has intensified, hindering the country's unification and construction and threatening the nation's survival and freedom. Therefore, the second step must be to build the army to accomplish the task of suppressing the rebellion. Building the army and building the country are closely related. According to the meaning of "no air defense is no national defense," the construction of the air force is particularly important and urgent. You students are the backbone of the air force and should be even more aware of the great responsibility you will bear in the future. The work of suppressing the rebellion and building the country will not be completed until the rebellion is suppressed and the country is built. Second, you should develop the spirit of both wisdom and courage. The 20th century has entered the age of atomic energy. Due to scientific progress, the speed of air force construction has been accelerated. In the future, you students must continue to study humbly and strive for perfection in your service process to enhance your new intelligence. At the same time, with a spirit of great fearlessness, prepare to fight and sacrifice yourselves at any time to save the country and the people, and make contributions to the country. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions have shown us that we must "learn skills and understand life and death." Our air force must have these spiritual conditions in order to establish a model of modern air force. Third, you should cherish material resources and strengthen combat effectiveness. Our country's science and industry are backward, and the aviation industry is still in its infancy. All material equipment depends almost entirely on foreign supplies. In the future, you students must take great care of all machinery, equipment, and weapons, eliminate waste, and make full use of them to maximize their effectiveness. If you students can understand the difficulty of the country's financial and material resources, it is actually tantamount to enhancing the country's unlimited strength in national defense. I hope that you will deeply understand the above three points and faithfully implement them. Today is the most difficult period for national construction, and it is also a good opportunity for you students to succeed and establish a career. The country expects you students to be very eager. The task is heavy and the road is long, so let us encourage each other. Chiang Kai-shek

### Meeting of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly: Wei Daoming Hopes to Assist in the Purchase of Surplus Grain from Large Landlords in Order to Promote the Interests of the Public with Some of the Profits

[Our newspaper, Taipei, 1st dispatch] The fifth session of the first Taiwan Provincial Assembly opened today, with 32 provincial assembly members attending, chaired by Huang Chaoqin. In his opening speech, Wei Daoming said: He hopes to promote the interests of the public with some of the profits. In other words, he hopes to assist the provincial government in the policy of purchasing surplus grain from large landlords in the grain policy to maintain social stability. Today and tomorrow, the conference is a preparatory meeting, and the general report on governance will begin on the 3rd.

Li Lianchun Discusses Taiwan's Grain Policy

[Another dispatch] At the press conference of the Provincial Information Office, Grain Bureau Director Li Lianchun reported on the grain policy, saying: The grain policy of this province adopts a management policy that combines political and economic forces. In other words, it uses political forces to ban grain exports and control grain sources, and uses economic forces to enable the government to control a part of the grain and transport and sell it by itself to regulate prices. At present, the government controls more than 180,000 tons of grain. When grain prices fluctuate, it will sell it at par in Taipei, Keelung, Kaohsiung, Hsinchu and other consumption points. Therefore, the current highest retail price is 95 yuan per catty, which is about 40% of the grain price in the mainland. However, in order to achieve the goal of controlling grain, the government must purchase surplus grain from large landlords. Because a few people criticize the government for the low purchase price, and even hope to stop the purchase, they do not know that large landlords in this province only account for three-thousandths of the total population, and the interests in between can be seen. Li Qiang emphasized the importance of this province's grain in the national economic status, saying: If the central government can supply 400,000 tons of fertilizer, this province can have a surplus of 500,000 tons of grain to supply the mainland, so that the grain shortage can be avoided. At present, this province produces 990,000 tons of rice, with a slight surplus.

### Sun Yueqi Reports to Reporters on the Current Situation of the Resources Commission's Enterprises: Using the US Aid Plan to Develop Coal Mines in Hunan and Jiangxi

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 1st dispatch] Sun Yueqi, chairman of the Resources Commission, attended a press conference of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau on the afternoon of the 1st to report on the commission's business and answer reporters' questions. According to Sun, the businesses run by the Resources Commission can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) electricity, (2) factories, and (3) mining. In detail, it can be divided into eleven types: (1) coal mines, (2) metal plating, (3) oil mines, (4) electricity, (5) steel, (6) machinery industry, (7) electrical engineering, (8) chemical industry, (9) sugar, (10) paper, (11) cement. In terms of regions, the businesses run by the Resources Commission are distributed in seven regions: (1) Northeast, (2) North China, (3) Taiwan, (4) Central China, (5) South China, (6) Northwest, (7) Southwest. The construction in the Northwest and Southwest regions has achieved results during the War of Resistance. Central and South China were occupied by the enemy during the War of Resistance, and the construction was very small. The industry in the three regions of Northeast China, North China, and Taiwan is very developed, but the construction in the three regions is currently the most difficult. Taking Northeast China as an example, one is because most of the industrial equipment was dismantled and moved by the Soviet Union, and the other is due to the destruction of the communist bandits. In addition, most of the Northeast region is occupied by the communist bandits, and construction is very difficult. In North China, Pingjin's factories and mines continue to operate, but some areas are also occupied by the communist bandits. There are many industrial and mining enterprises in Taiwan. Before the enemy surrendered, they were bombed by Allied aircraft, and the losses were quite heavy. In the past two years, they have been actively constructed, and the industry and mines have made progress. It is believed that there will be production output in the future. Among the above eleven businesses, coal, steel, oil, and electricity are the central work. In terms of machinery, Taiwan Sugar's production also occupies an extremely important position. As for the staff of the Resources Commission, there are a total of 220,000 people. The losses in the Northeast were very large. Excellent engineers such as Zhang Xinfu and Yu Zailin were killed by the communist bandits. When the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant retreated, many specialized talents were also captured by the communist bandits. Sun continued to answer reporters' questions, saying: Among the various businesses run by the Resources Commission, electricity accounts for about 60% of the country, and steel accounted for 99% of the country before Anshan fell, but it has been greatly reduced. However, after the Shijingshan Iron Mine in North China starts production, pig iron can still be self-sufficient. Coal production accounted for 35% of the country last year, but now only the Fushun and Benxihu coal mines are producing. Most of the other major mines are occupied by the communist bandits, and it is less than 20%. A reporter asked if the focus of chicken construction will be shifted to South China? Sun smiled and said: This is difficult to answer, but industrial construction cannot be completed in a short period of time and must be placed in a safe place. If the focus of industrial construction is threatened by the communist bandits at any time, it will be in danger of abandoning the previous achievements. The reporter asked what plans the Resources Commission has for the use of US aid? Sun replied that a plan has been drawn up to open coal mines in Xiangtan, Hunan and Pingxiang, Jiangxi. This plan has been submitted to Stilwell.

### Commissioner of Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Liu Wei-chi, Discusses Methods of Utilizing Overseas Chinese Capital:  Remittances Should Be Purchased at Free Market Prices

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st]  Regarding the issues of utilizing Overseas Chinese resources and attracting Overseas Chinese remittances, Liu Wei-chi, the Commissioner of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, recently spoke to reporters about effective measures.  Liu stated that there are over ten million Overseas Chinese residing abroad, distributed throughout the world.  After the end of World War II, many countries still restricted Overseas Chinese from remitting money back home.  However, these countries that restrict Overseas Chinese remittances do not restrict the export of Overseas Chinese goods.  Therefore, given the increasingly serious situation of anti-Chinese movements, the government should comprehensively consider how to utilize Overseas Chinese goods to enable them to be shipped back to the motherland in large quantities to supplement the necessary production materials, and formulate concrete and effective measures for swift implementation.  Recently, the government has made some changes to the import of Overseas Chinese goods at the request of the Overseas Chinese Affairs authorities and Overseas Chinese, but the scope is still insufficient.  It should expand the base as much as possible so that the import of all Overseas Chinese goods does not necessarily have to be handled by the government.  It should only impose reasonable restrictions on the use of funds from the sale of goods under government guidance.  The method of restriction can specify generous interest rates, so that the Overseas Chinese capital can be stored in national banks, or stipulate that a portion of the Overseas Chinese capital be designated by the government to purchase production-related materials or raw materials from abroad and then import them for national use, or designate it to purchase government bonds and various government-issued securities.  In this way, the Overseas Chinese will surely be happy to comply and accept.  As for Overseas Chinese remittances, before the war, the average annual income from Overseas Chinese remittances alone reached more than 100 million US dollars.  Our country's international payments depended on this to barely maintain balance.  After the war broke out, the amount of Overseas Chinese remittances decreased significantly.  After the end of the war, Overseas Chinese remittances should have greatly increased.  However, because the official exchange rate of the US dollar is too far from the free market price, the value of the currency depreciates when it is remitted back to the motherland, resulting in widespread avoidance.  Although the government has made various improvements to Overseas Chinese remittances, it still feels insufficient.  According to Commissioner Liu's opinion, the improvement measures can be summarized into two points: first, all Overseas Chinese remittances should be purchased at the free market price of the day; second, the government should allow Overseas Chinese to freely bring in foreign currency, gold, or foreign securities, etc.  However, to prevent them from engaging in speculative behavior, the imported gold or foreign currency can be registered at the time of import.  If the carrier needs to sell it, the government can purchase it at the free market price of the day.  If this can be done, it can achieve lasting results.

### Abundant Grain Reserves in Southern Jiangsu

### Ministry of National Defense Releases Weekly War Situation Report: Focus of Central Plains War Shifts from Western Shandong to Eastern Henan

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The Ministry of National Defense released the weekly war situation report from June 24th to June 30th as follows:

(1) Central Plains War: The focus of the war this week has shifted from western Shandong to eastern Henan.

1. Kaifeng Campaign: Chen Yi's 3rd, 8th, and 10th columns, since June 16th, sneaked into Kaifeng via the southern Henan corridor. Their original intention was still to respond to the main force of Chen's bandits moving south. While our army was reinforcing Kaifeng, Chen's 1st, 4th, and 6th columns and the Guangdong-Guangxi Rapid Columns sneaked into the triangular area of Nanqi County, Tongxu, and Minquan south of the Longhai Railway, echoing the 3rd, 8th, and 10th columns. In addition, Chen Geng's 9th column was in the Zhongmu and Baisha area, obstructing our western route National Army from advancing towards Kaifeng, while at the same time coordinating with Liu's 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 10th columns and Chen Geng's 4th column near Xiping and Shangcai to delay the progress of our southern route army. In total, the bandits used more than 100,000 troops to block our reinforcement of Kaifeng, but this also gave the National Army a chance to defeat them individually. Our western Shandong pursuit force launched a fierce attack on the bandits' flanks from Chengwu to Caoxian and Kaocheng, killing more than 8,000 bandits. Together with the bandits killed near Lanfeng, Yejigang, Zhongmu, Baisha, and Shangcai, plus the bandits bombed by our air force in various places, and the bandits killed by us north and south of the Wanfu River, the total number reached more than 34,700 people. (Rumors that the air force bombed civilians have been investigated and found to be untrue. The air force has separately announced the true facts.) In the Kaifeng campaign, because the bandits adopted a human wave tactic, the number of bandits killed by our joint land and air forces, before and after, exceeded 15,000. Our losses during the same period, including local militias, were only 16,000 people, which is less than one-third of the bandit's casualties of more than 49,700 people.

Under the cooperation of the military and civilians in the defense of Kaifeng, communication was interrupted on the 22nd. On the evening of the 23rd, a portion of our defending troops and militias transferred to the northeast area of Kaifeng and made contact with the commando unit dispatched from Zhongmu. Seeing that our troops from all directions were about to encircle them, Chen Yi's 3rd, 8th, and 10th columns hurriedly collected vehicles, and the main force escorted the looted materials and fled south through Chichangzhen. Our vanguard entered the northern city of Kaifeng at 9:00 PM on the 25th. By 2:00 PM on the 26th, two of our divisions had been stationed in Kaifeng. At 4:15 PM, our western advance force also broke through the 10th column's rearguard, the bandit rearguard, after breaking through the bandit rearguard, in Xinglongji and reached Kaifeng. Thus, our armies from the east, west, and north officially joined forces in Kaifeng.

The bandits harassed Kaifeng city for four days, their main task being to loot materials and capture and kill civil servants. According to Wu Zheng, the artillery platoon leader of the 66th Division of the Kaifeng garrison, who escaped, the bandits drove more than 5,000 of our party, government, and military civil servants to the Yellow River beach, tricked them into waiting for boats, and collectively shot them. Wu Zheng was one of the lucky survivors. The bandit army's inhumanity reached this point, and they still make false propaganda to deceive the ignorant, but they cannot hide the facts in the end.

2. Eastern Henan Campaign: After the recovery of Kaifeng, our armies launched a full-scale suppression campaign against the bandit troops who had retreated to the Yellow River flooded area. From the 27th, we successively captured Chenliu, Suixian, and Qixian. On the 29th, in the area south of Suixian and east of Tongxu, the two sides are currently engaged in the fiercest battle. In the past three days, the bandits' Guangdong-Guangxi columns have been destroyed by us. The bandits' casualties have exceeded 20,000, and the National Army's losses are about 5,000. In addition, Liu's bandits' 2nd, 3rd, and 6th columns, which had sneaked to the vicinity of Xuchang, also mostly fled north at night, passing Changge and Weichuan, seemingly to respond to Chen's bandits in Tongxu. The development of the war on this front is worthy of attention if the Chen and Liu bandits do not try to find gaps to escape the decisive battle as they have in the past.

(2) Situation in Eastern Hebei and Central Shandong: In addition to the Eastern Henan battlefield, the situation in eastern Hebei and central Shandong was also more important this week.

1. Eastern Hebei: The bandits Lin Biao's 11th column, Li Yunchang's 8th column, and Nie Rongzhen's 2nd and 4th columns, along with eight regiments belonging to the bandits' 3rd and 12th military sub-districts, totaling more than 60,000 people, launched attacks on our strongholds such as Beidaihe, Liushouying, Anshan, Shimen, Changli, and Leizhuang, west of Qinhuangdao and east of Guye on the section of the Beining Railway inside the pass, starting on the 24th. Anshan, Shimen, and Changli were once captured by the bandits. The bandits' purpose was to destroy the Beining Railway, but as of the 29th, all the above strongholds have been recovered by our army. Our eastern and western troops also joined forces in Changli and are continuing to pursue the bandits. We are actively repairing the railway that was destroyed by the bandits and will soon restore it to its original state.

2. Central Shandong: Since Chen's bandits' 7th and 8th columns, together with the 13th column, once again launched an attack on the outer defenses of Yanzhou, the bandits launched fierce attacks on our East Gate and West Gate from the 25th to the 27th, and the battle was extremely fierce. On the 28th, the situation eased as the bandits suffered heavy casualties, exceeding 8,000 people. On the evening of the 29th, the fighting started again. The bandits attacking the East and West Gates were repelled by our air force in coordination with the defending troops. At the moment, the city defense of Yanzhou is very solid. Although the bandits' 9th column in Mingshui is rushing south at night to reinforce, planning to take advantage of the fact that our reinforcements have not yet arrived to capture Yanzhou and make a long-term attempt to obstruct the Jinpu transportation, in fact, in the middle of this week, the bandits gained nothing except heavy sacrifices.

### Three Powers Resolve on Joint Action to Protest Soviet Blockade of Berlin Traffic: Note Drafted and Ready for Issuance Pending Approval by Diplomatic Authorities; Soviets Announce End of Four-Power Administration of Berlin

[United Press, London, 1st] Well-informed official sources stated today that the United States, Britain, and France have drafted a joint note demanding that the Soviet Union lift the blockade of Berlin and restore four-power joint administration of the area. The note is ready for submission to Moscow once approved by US Secretary of State Marshall, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Bidault, possibly later this week. The note was drafted by US Ambassador to Britain Douglas, French Ambassador to Britain Massigli, and British Foreign Office expert Strang. The three met for two hours today and finalized the wording. The content has not been officially announced, but it is understood that the Soviet Union will be responsible for anything that happens to the residents of West Berlin if the Berlin blockade is not lifted.

[United Press, Washington, 1st] It is understood that the United States, Britain, and France are preparing to lodge a serious protest with Moscow against the Soviet blockade of Berlin. Diplomats say that according to current plans, unless the Soviet Union suddenly changes its policy and orders the Soviet military commander on the border to reopen land traffic to Berlin, a direct request to the Kremlin cannot be prevented.

According to the most well-informed sources, the protest letter to Moscow will take the following form: First, it will require the Soviet Foreign Ministry to deal with the immediate abolition of traffic restrictions; second, if the Soviet government does not issue the above order, the three powers will not be responsible for the possible consequences; third, it will again ask the Soviet Union to agree to unify the economy of Berlin and all of Germany, although the above request has long been tried without result.

[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] The Soviet Union formally announced the end of four-power joint administration of Berlin today. Colonel Kalinin, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Military Command in Berlin, summoned the chiefs of staff of the Allied countries this afternoon to read a pre-prepared declaration announcing the end of four-power joint administration of Berlin. The declaration stated: "Colonel Howley's (US Commander in Berlin) notorious style, the lack of response from British and French representatives to protests from the Soviet authorities, and the Western Allied countries' unilateral implementation of currency reform in Berlin have made it impossible for the four-power meeting of the Berlin Joint Military Government to be held. Soviet representatives will no longer attend four-power meetings of the Berlin Joint Military Government." After the reading, the British Chief of Staff Osborne, the US Chief of Staff Bull, and the French Chief of Staff Dano inquired about the status of the Joint Military Government. Kalinin replied that Soviet representatives will no longer participate in any level of the Joint Military Government, but its technical employees will remain in the Joint Military Government for the time being to sort out documents. During the period when the Soviet technicians are sorting out the files, the Soviet flag will continue to be displayed alongside the flags of the other three powers, and a Soviet sentry will continue to be stationed at the entrance. Although the Joint Military Government has ended, its previous orders to Berlin will still be recognized by the Soviet side, as the Soviet side respects the four-power agreement, and these agreements and resolutions are still valid for the Soviet Union.

### West German Premiers Accept Three Powers' Suggestions: Constitutional Assembly to Convene Before September to Draft New Constitution and Organize Autonomous Government

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 1st] British Military Governor Robertson, US Military Governor Clay, and French Military Governor Koenig formally presented suggestions to the premiers of the eleven West German states today at the US Military Government headquarters here, instructing them to convene a constitutional assembly before the beginning of September to implement the plans related to the future of West Germany resolved by the London Six-Nation Conference. The content will enable the West German Federation to take over most of the internal responsibilities currently exercised by the three-power military government. The three powers' suggestions were drafted after the three military governors met overnight, charging the Germans with selecting administrative institutions with clearly defined powers and establishing an independent Supreme Court with the power to review federal legislation and resolve interstate disputes.

The suggestion stipulates that the new constitution drafted by the constitutional assembly should establish a bicameral federal parliament to exercise legislative power over administration and taxation. The legislative powers over education, religion, culture, and welfare will be exercised by the state parliaments, and the federal parliament will only be responsible for liaison and coordination. In his speech at the meeting, Clay emphasized the necessity of establishing the West German government as early as possible. He said that the Western occupying powers are well aware of the need for the West German constitutional assembly to be convened before the beginning of September. After the constitution is formulated, the work of organizing the West German government can move a step forward. In addition to reiterating the necessity of convening the constitutional assembly as soon as possible, Robertson also said that the London Conference decided that this constitutional assembly should, if possible, accommodate representatives from the eastern states. Although a series of events have recently occurred between the occupying powers, it would certainly still be a good thing if you could persuade your East German colleagues to participate in this great event.

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 1st] Today's meeting of the West German premiers lasted only an hour or so. French Commander-in-Chief Koenig also presented an occupation bill to the meeting, stipulating the relationship between the Allied occupation authorities and the new constitutional government of Germany. British Commander-in-Chief Robertson also asked several states to review their borders in order to adjust them according to traditional systems.

Although Ambassador Smith is still here, according to reliable sources, he will also leave the Soviet Union before the end of the year. Smith had agreed to Truman's request to remain in office until after the US election. In addition, many senior embassy officials will be replaced soon. There have been many changes in recent months.

### Cominform Headquarters Moved to Bucharest

[Reuters, London, 30th] Reliable sources in Belgrade say that the headquarters of the nine-nation Cominform will be moved from Belgrade to Bucharest, the capital of Romania. The Cominform meeting that recently decided to expel Tito and the Yugoslav Communists from the Cominform was held in Bucharest. The Yugoslav ambassador to Czechoslovakia told them that the Cominform's criticism of the Yugoslav Communists was based on malicious information provided by Hebron and Shuzo, two people who had been expelled from the government and expelled from the party by the Yugoslav authorities.

### Yugoslavia Determined to Strengthen Its Strength to Safeguard National Independence and Freedom: Marshal Tito Enthusiastically Supported by the People

[United Press, Yugoslavia, 30th] Marshal Tito visited a construction project in the capital city for two hours today, accompanied by several communist cadres and senior military officers. This was Tito's first appearance in two weeks. The mystery surrounding his disappearance has been swept away. The young workers at the site shouted "Long live!" to welcome him. Tito's appearance symbolizes that the Yugoslav Communists continue to back him and disregard the Cominform's accusations of his betrayal of the party.

On the surface, the leaders of the Yugoslav Communist Party continue to maintain a peaceful stance. The Central Committee of the Communist Party issued a second statement, announcing its intention to strengthen and continue to promote urgent cooperation with the Soviet Union and other Soviet satellite countries, but stressed that "the independence of the Yugoslav nation is a condition for moving towards socialism and its comprehensive progress" and demanded "comprehensive strengthening of the Yugoslav army to defend the nation's freedom and independence."

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 30th] Well-informed sources deny various rumors about the situation inside Yugoslavia, especially the news of conflicts occurring along the border. Foreigners are currently not allowed to enter the border area, but this agency's correspondent can prove that everything is peaceful in Belgrade.

### Yugoslav Communists Condemn Bulgarian Communists

[United Press, London, 1st] Tito, the Yugoslav dictator, despite being surrounded by the Communist Party of Moscow and Eastern Europe, expanded his counterattack again on the 1st and attacked Bulgarian Premier Dimitrov, who is competing for leadership in the Balkans. Dimitrov is an old communist and a leader of the Third International. In January of this year, Dimitrov proposed a Balkan Federation. Once the Soviet Union objected, Dimitrov immediately admitted his mistake. In contrast, Tito believes that he has no special obligations to the Kremlin. His seizure of power is due to his merits in resisting Germany during the war. The Yugoslav Communist Party's newspaper "Borba" also published a fierce editorial defending Titoism and severely criticizing the Bulgarian Communists. However, 24 hours ago, the newspaper was still extending a hand of friendship to Bulgaria and proposing a Yugoslav-Bulgarian-Albanian federation.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 1st] Polish newspapers, in addition to supporting the Cominform's accusations against the Yugoslav Communists, have also created the new term "Titoism," which they define as "a doctrine with grand schemes characterized by megalomania, conceit, a lack of vision, and a lack of coordination."

[Reuters, Budapest, 1st] The Central Committee of the Hungarian Workers' Party (formed by the merger of the Communist Party and the left-wing Socialist Party) recently issued a declaration, stating its complete acceptance of the Cominform's resolution on the erroneous policies adopted by the Yugoslav Communists.

### Establishment of a Federal System and Recognition of Israel Rejected by the Arab League; Demands for Bernadotte to Revise Peace Proposals

[Report from this newspaper] London, 1st broadcast: The Political Committee of the Arab League informed reporters today that the committee has unanimously rejected the Palestine peace proposals put forward by the United Nations mediator, stating that the Arab side will formally respond on Saturday. At that time, a counter-proposal may be put forward.

[Reuters, Cairo, 1st] The Secretary-General of the Arab League, Azzam Pasha, said here that if Bernadotte's Palestine peace proposals are not revised, the Arabs will have no choice but to reject them. The Arab League has now appointed a subcommittee to draft a response to the proposal. Azzam emphasized, "We will never accept a federal system, and we will never accept the establishment of Israel within Palestine."

The Arabs will propose several amendments to Bernadotte's proposal, and it remains to be seen whether Bernadotte will accept them. If the Arab views cannot be reconciled with the Jewish views, then the Arabs will have no choice but to reject them. Azzam also said that the Arab response will be sent to Rhodes Island before the weekend.

[Reuters, Cairo, 1st] The Prime Minister of Transjordan, Abdul Huda, who is here attending the meeting of the Arab League Political Committee, stated that the Arabs have rejected Bernadotte's Palestine peace proposals because they cannot accept the existence of the State of Israel in Palestine. Huda also stated that Transjordan has no territorial ambitions in Palestine, and after the Arab residents of Palestine are liberated, they will be free to decide whether to join Transjordan or become an independent state within the Arab League.

### Arab Rejection of Participation in Arab-Jewish Roundtable Conference

Bernadotte Expresses Regret

[Reuters, Rhodes Island, 1st] Bernadotte announced that the Arabs have refused to send representatives here to participate in a roundtable conference with the Jewish side. He believes that this is the best way to seek compromise through direct talks, and the Arab refusal is indeed regrettable.

### Large Numbers of British and American Aircraft Transporting Food Supplies; Soviet Union Considering Relaxing the Berlin Blockade

[United Press, Berlin, 1st] The Soviet side indicated on the 1st that the Berlin Blockade may be lifted or relaxed soon. The official news agency of the Soviet occupation authorities stated that the authorities are considering revising the traffic regulations on the highways leading from Berlin to the Western sectors, "to reduce the current restrictions."

[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] As of 11:00 a.m. today, 49 American transport planes carrying food supplies have arrived at Tempelhof Airport in the American sector of Berlin, bringing nearly 100 tons of food. It is expected that by evening, the record of 125 aircraft arrivals on the 30th will be broken.

### Despite Soviet Use of Violence and Intimidation, the Three Powers are Determined to Remain in Berlin; Foreign Secretary Bevin Elaborates on Policy Towards Germany

[Reuters, London, 30th] The entire House of Commons greeted Foreign Secretary Bevin's solemn declaration that Britain will not yield in the Berlin crisis with great cheers. Previously, Conservative Deputy Leader Eden had called on the government to take a firm stance, saying that sometimes there is only one possible way to maintain peace, and now is the time to take a firm stand, and the Berlin incident is an event that must be approached firmly. The government should, together with other Western allies, solemnly inform the Soviet Union that it will not succumb to violence and intimidation.

In his reply, Bevin first detailed the course of the Berlin crisis. He said, "The Soviet Union, on the pretext of technical reasons, has successively prohibited traffic on highways, railways, inland waterways, and bridges. We have acknowledged its reasons and are willing to provide technical assistance and materials to help repair the bridges and railways. We cannot help but suspect the Soviet Union's motives in creating difficulties, whether they are truly technical issues and currency control issues, or whether there is another political purpose to force us to withdraw from Berlin. As far as technical issues are concerned, we are willing to provide assistance, even at the cost of providing repair materials that we ourselves lack, so that traffic can be restored as soon as possible. As far as currency control is concerned, it has long since become ineffective. Then its motive is to make our position in Berlin difficult and force us to withdraw. If the Soviet Union wants to use any means to create famine for 2.5 million people in West Berlin, thereby causing chaos and reaction, in order to put pressure on its wartime allies, then the British government will not succumb to it (cheers). I dare to believe that the United States and France hold similar views (cheers). We cannot abandon the democratic elements in Berlin who refuse to succumb to Soviet pressure. Countless Berlin citizens would rather endure any suffering than accept Soviet rule. These citizens deserve our full support. The steps we have taken in handling these events are all in close consultation with the governments of the United States and France. Representatives of Britain, the United States, and France hold meetings frequently as needed to address the situation. We have a full understanding of the task before us and the obstacles we will face. The British government has decided to use all available capabilities, and the United States has also taken similar measures to prevent the complete disruption of freight, so that the restrictions promulgated by the Soviet Union will lose their effectiveness. The United States government, like us, has confirmed that its position in Berlin is based on agreement, and its will to continue to stay in Berlin will never change. This morning, there were rumors that Sokolovsky had the intention to lift some restrictions. I do not intend to argue about Sokolovsky's words, but what we need now is action, not empty words. I have to solemnly declare that we all insist that Berlin should be governed on the basis of the Four Powers, and we are also ready to discuss the Berlin situation on the basis of the Four Powers at any time. At the same time, we must continue to carry out all our plans to cope with the situation. However, given the complexity and subtlety of the current situation, the British government must also proceed with caution and cannot take risks rashly." When talking about the general situation in Germany, Bevin said that the Soviet Union has consistently violated the Potsdam Agreement and undermined the possible reunification of Germany. In the past three years, the Soviet Union has obtained as much as 7 billion yuan in reparations from its occupied area, leaving Britain and the United States alone to bear the task of maintaining the survival of the Germans. Britain's assistance in Germany's reconstruction has exceeded 200 million pounds. The Potsdam Agreement stipulates the demilitarization of Germany, the elimination of Nazism, and the completion of democratization. In the Western sector, these initial goals have been achieved and are available for inspection at any time, but in the Soviet sector, it has always been shrouded in secrecy. Judging from the German newspapers controlled by the Soviet Union, the National Democratic Party is being organized in East Germany to absorb former Nazis. From a security point of view, the Western countries cannot help but feel extremely concerned about this.

### McNeil Concludes Debate

[Reuters, London, 1st] Minister of State McNeil, representing the government, expressed regret in the House of Commons today at the end of the debate on the German issue for some parties' alarmist rhetoric about the Berlin crisis. He said that the situation in Berlin has reached a serious level and cannot be exaggerated by rumors. Here he pointed out that the rumor that the Soviet Union has set up blocking balloons around Berlin is absolutely untrue. If this were the case, the Western powers would have to shoot them down, which would cause a real conflict. It is expected that the Soviet Union is not prepared to do so. McNeil then reiterated Foreign Secretary Bevin's words, stating that the Western powers will not yield and will continue to stay in Berlin, with or without balloons.

### City Council General Assembly Concludes Successfully; Speaker Delivers Speech Raising Awareness; Difficulties Ahead are Just Beginning; Should Stabilize the Military, Police, and Middle-Class Production

[Report from this newspaper] The Sixth Session of the First City Council General Assembly concluded successfully yesterday after holding its eighth meeting. This meeting, which opened on the 21st of last month, continued to be held, excluding Thursdays, with two extended days, for a total of ten days. More than 150 proposals were discussed, and most of them were successfully concluded.

Yesterday's meeting began at 3:45 p.m. After the case of establishing a Municipal Chinese Medicine Hospital was debated for an hour and passed, the discussion of the remaining proposals mostly went smoothly. By 7:50 p.m., all the agenda items had been discussed. Five minutes later, the adjournment ceremony was held.

The adjournment ceremony began with the melodious sounds of military music. After the Speaker led the formal ceremony, he took the stage to deliver the adjournment speech, stating that this meeting lasted a total of ten days, and all members carefully and enthusiastically discussed various proposals, achieving considerable conclusions, which is truly gratifying. He recalled that when the meeting opened on the 21st of last month, he mentioned the price fluctuations over the past three and a half months, but the price fluctuations during the ten days of the meeting were more drastic than in the past three and a half months. The central government is of course concerned about this, and the Executive Yuan and the relevant departments have reportedly drafted emergency measures to be implemented after being approved by the highest authorities. The municipal authorities also convened a temporary economic conference in the shortest possible time, deciding on four emergency measures to be implemented, which have achieved considerable results in recent days, and prices are gradually stabilizing. However, another factor in price stabilization is that the financial sector is currently in the midst of its settlement period, so the economic trends after the settlement period are also worthy of attention. Furthermore, the Northeast circulating notes may also flow to Shanghai after the Ping Municipal Council passed a resolution to temporarily suspend their exchange, and domestic remittances have recently been opened, and idle funds tend to flock to Shanghai. All of these factors deserve the increased awareness of the council members.

Next, he talked about public security. The economy is life, but public security is not only life, but also the very existence of being. If public security is not guaranteed, then one's life and property will eventually be unsecured. Therefore, to protect public security, all members should pay extreme attention to the lives of the military and police in Shanghai who are defending the city, and should do their best to ensure that they have no worries about food and clothing. In addition to maintaining public security, it is especially necessary to maintain the stability of the lives of the middle class. The council will never speak for the wealthy, but it cannot look down on the majority of the middle-class industry and commerce because it cannot stand the few wealthy individuals. Today, I am speaking for industry and commerce, not only for the investors of industry and commerce, but also for the entire staff who serve industry and commerce. If industry and commerce collapse, then how will the staff who serve the various industries and businesses solve their livelihoods? Therefore, speaking from Shanghai's point of view, our order of life is all due to the economic difficulties, and the difficulties ahead may be just beginning, so there should be a proper response plan. During this adjournment period, members should raise awareness, and the responsibilities of the members are significant. During the adjournment period, they should continue to work tirelessly and work together with the authorities to overcome difficulties.

Mayor Expresses Many Feelings; Puts Forward Two Points of View

Then, Mayor Wu gave a speech, stating that he was deeply moved by the Speaker's words and wanted to raise two points: (1) At this difficult time, everyone should have a common goal, which is to recognize that the communist bandits are everyone's enemy, and should not have any hope of surviving by seeking temporary peace. (2) The government and the people must have a spirit of mutual understanding and trust. At this point, he listed some thorny issues that were difficult to handle, but the results still failed to gain understanding from the outside world. (1) The price of rice distributed in July was set at 10 million yuan per dan after much effort, but it has been subjected to setbacks and accusations. (2) The adjustment of the prices of public utilities. The problem of the cost of living index. He finally pointed out that the current time is an extraordinary period, and everyone should understand and help each other, recognize the goal, contribute money or effort, and then the difficulties will not be difficult to overcome.

Finally, City Councilor Shao Yongsheng gave a response, saying that the Speaker's words were earnest and sincere, and that the Mayor's achievements since taking office were remarkable, making him a great politician. He believed that democratic politics is a politics of criticism, with standards, scope, and a consistent public concept, and generally there will not be many errors except in very few cases. Therefore, members should study how to make suggestions to the government that meet the needs of truth.

### Yesterday's Meeting

Yesterday's meeting began at 3:45 p.m. To avoid the case of the Chinese Medicine Hospital taking too long to debate, it was postponed for discussion, and the other seven cases in the health section were first submitted for public discussion. As a result, all of them were passed in accordance with the examination opinions. Important cases included: (1) Please construct complete public restrooms near the North Railway Station. (2) Please have the Health Bureau pay attention to the sanitation of the Nanshi area, clear the streets, and ban privately built toilets. (3) To prevent epidemics, please strengthen sanitation work, etc.

There were a total of eight cases in the regulations section. The discussion of important cases proceeded as follows: (1) Proposed to send a telegram in the name of the General Assembly to the national representatives and legislators produced in this city, asking them to take the lead in opposing the unreasonable demands of a few public opinion representatives who disregard the livelihood of the people and demand personal treatment from the government. The examination opinion was reserved. During the discussion, three opinions were generated: amended and passed, re-submitted for examination, and passed according to the original case. The results of the vote showed that none of them could obtain a majority of the votes, so this case was declared invalid. (2) In response to the Thai government's destruction of overseas Chinese education, a motion was passed to submit a serious protest to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (3) A motion was passed to send a telegram to the Executive Yuan, requesting that the Japanese fishing boats and crew seized this time be severely punished. (4) Proposed that the central government immediately replace the corrupt and incompetent officials in charge at all levels with energetic, intelligent, and honest new personnel to thoroughly reform politics. (5) A motion was passed to launch an anti-Soviet and aid bandit suppression campaign, present the secret agreement of the Chinese Communist Party selling out the country, and demand the recovery of Lushun and Dalian.

Budget Should be Frugal; Expand Business Expenses

There were only two cases in the budget section: (1) The city's budget should be frugally managed by the various agencies themselves to expand business expenses in order to promote municipal administration. It was resolved to be submitted to the municipal government for consideration. (2) The office expenses of the district people's representative meetings and the meal expenses of the district people's representatives attending the meetings were proposed to be increased. It was resolved to be submitted to the municipal government for appropriate increase.

In the section on retroactive recognition cases, there were 73 important cases of resolutions made by various committees during the recess period of the five general assemblies of the council, all of which were passed and retroactively recognized. After separately passing the acceptance of the examination of the municipal government's policy report and the report of the resolution review committee, a temporary recess was announced.

Municipal Chinese Medicine Hospital; Motion to Add New Facility Passed

At 5:30 p.m., the meeting reconvened and the case of "Please add a Municipal Chinese Medicine Hospital to meet social needs" was submitted for discussion. Those who expressed their opinions included Jing Zhou, Shi Zongde, Zhang Zhihan, Jiang Huaisu, Zhang Zhongyuan, Shui Xiangyun, Ye Fenghu, Yang Fusheng, Yu Shun, Zhu Yakui, Yan Guodong, Qu Yue, Zhou Xiangsheng, Jiang Hao, Chen Baotai, Chen Cunren, Fan Shouyuan, and many others. Printed materials were distributed at the venue like snowflakes, and a petitioning group from the Nanjing Road Store Association appeared outside the venue, demanding the establishment of a Municipal Chinese Medicine Hospital. The opinions of the city councilors varied, and many recounted their own experiences of being cured by Chinese medicine or Western medicine, making the scene very lively. At 6:15 p.m., the chairman announced the end of the discussion and summarized the opinions of the city councilors into four points, which were submitted for voting. Finally, with 75 votes (out of 139 councilors present), a majority vote was obtained to amend the reasons for the original case and pass it.

With this case resolved, the meeting seemed to be relieved of a heavy burden, and then proceeded to discuss the report submitted by the Public Utilities Investigation Committee. The Secretary-General reported the recommendations for various public utilities. The secretariat read out the conclusions of the report, and the chairman immediately submitted it for discussion, and two resolutions were passed: (1) Pass the acceptance of the report, (2) The Public Utilities Investigation Committee is approved to conclude immediately.

Temporary Motions

Finally, 32 temporary motions were submitted for discussion. Except for a few that were submitted for examination, most of them were passed. Noteworthy cases are as follows: (1) Send a telegram to the central government, urging it to negotiate with the Hong Kong government through diplomatic channels to stop the exchange of Hong Kong currency, and ask it to deny that Hong Kong currency outside and inside the territory has the same value, in order to alleviate our country's economic crisis. (2) Recommend that the central government improve the road administration of the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou) lines. (3) Please have the municipal government quickly allocate a suitable burial site so that Pushan Villa can continue to bury the deceased. (4) Prices have soared in recent days, and the five major department stores in the city often close early, which is close to hoarding and confusing the public. A motion was passed to ask the municipal government to issue an order to the industry association to instruct them to correct the situation in the name of the General Assembly. (5) Please have the municipal government fully assist the garrison headquarters in raising funds to establish an independent garrison brigade within a time limit to strengthen the local armed forces of the city.

### Air-Conditioned Train to Begin Operation on the 15th

[Report from this newspaper] Most of the "air-conditioned trains" of the Jinghu Railway Bureau have been assembled, and they will definitely be able to join the Jinghu line on the 15th of this month as scheduled. However, the traffic density of the Jinghu line has reached saturation, so the addition of air-conditioned trains must stop the operation of one of the original passenger trains. It is reported that the Railway Bureau intends to stop the operation of the Triumph Express and replace it with an air-conditioned train. The driving speed will also be shortened to five hours for the entire Jinghu journey, restoring the speed of the pre-war express train. It will depart from the North Shanghai Station at 7:00 a.m. every morning and arrive in Nanjing at 12:30 p.m. It will depart from Nanjing Station at 6:00 p.m. and arrive in Shanghai at 11:30 p.m.

### First-Run Movies Raise Prices Again; All Ticket Prices Increase by 100,000 Yuan; Suspension of Western Film Supply Results in Stalemate; Cinema Industry Demands Termination of Contracts

[Report from this newspaper] The stalemate between the cinema industry association and the Western film merchants association caused by the suspension of new film supply problem has not been resolved as of last night. According to the cinema industry association, this time the association resolutely demanded compensation for losses and termination of contracts from the Western film merchants. Although the various cinemas themselves know that they are at a disadvantage, in order to express their position and point out who is ultimately responsible for this matter, they have decided to insist on the resolution without compromise, and are prepared to break off relations completely. As for the first-run cinemas showing Western films, in order to adapt to the increase in the cost of living index, they have decided to adjust ticket prices starting today to a minimum price of 200,000 yuan, with the remaining levels increasing by 100,000 yuan, becoming four levels of 300,000, 400,000, 500,000, and 600,000. However, the cinema industry association has formally denied the rumor that this price increase is to approach the ideal conditions of Western film merchants in order to leave room for negotiation with each other. The association stated that the various cinemas can still maintain operations by showing old films. If box office sales gradually decline, they will immediately switch to showing domestic films. They hope that domestic film manufacturers can seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work hard on production and exercise caution in making films in order to replace the deep-rooted position of Western films in Shanghai.

### Petitioners Striking Property Tax; Representatives of Industry and Commerce Return to Shanghai

Report Petition Process Successful

[Report from this newspaper] The preparatory committee of the Shanghai Industrial Association held its fourth standing committee meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. More than ten people, including Du Yuesheng, Hu Boxiang, and Xu Xueyu, attended.

It is hoped that the industrial and commercial circles of the city will continue their efforts and will definitely achieve final victory. The petition representatives are scheduled to go to Beijing again this weekend to continue the petition. The meeting also decided to hold a tea party at the City Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 p.m. today, jointly convened by the City Chamber of Commerce and the preparatory committee of the Industrial Association, to report on the petition process of the 12 representatives of industry and commerce who went to Beijing.

### Domestic Airline Ticket Prices Adjusted Today, Ranging from 100% to 180% Increase

[Report from Our Newspaper] Effective today, domestic airline ticket prices will be adjusted with increases ranging from 100% to 180%. The Shanghai-Beijing route will only increase by 100%; the Beijing-Shenyang and Beijing-Taiyuan routes by 120%; the Shanghai-Lanzhou and Shanghai-Kunming routes by 140%; and the Southern China and Hong Kong routes will have the highest increase at 180%. Ordinary cargo and excess baggage, previously charged at 1% of the ticket price per kilogram, will now be charged at 2% of the ticket price. Valuables will be charged at 5% of the ticket price per kilogram, mail and letters at 1% of the ticket price, parcels at 2%, and newspapers will continue to be charged at 60% of the postal rate.

Striving to Maintain Transportation

According to a spokesperson for the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC): The Ministry of Transportation's approved increase is far from the company's request for a general increase of 189%. Furthermore, fuel prices, exchange rates, and the cost of living have increased since July 1st. Using February 7th as a base, the cost of living as of July 1st has risen by 646%, gasoline by 2460%, and exchange rates by 1750%. According to the cost calculation formula, current ticket prices should be 1595% higher than on February 7th, but the cumulative approved increases have only reached 750%. Under these circumstances, the airline, in order to reduce losses and ensure its survival, is considering reducing the number of flights. More flights mean greater losses, while fewer flights can reduce losses. However, even with reduced flights, the airline will strive to maintain air transportation to cities of political and economic importance.

Compilation of Fares for Various Routes

The adjusted fares from Shanghai to various destinations are listed below: (1) Twin-engine aircraft: To Nanjing 5.2 million yuan, to Qingdao 28 million yuan, to Jinan 40.8 million yuan, to Beijing 55 million yuan, to Zhengzhou 47.9 million yuan, to Xi'an 78.8 million yuan, to Lanzhou 105.4 million yuan, to Dihua 202.4 million yuan, to Jiujiang 27.5 million yuan, to Hankou 37.8 million yuan, to Chongqing 73.1 million yuan, to Hengyang 61.7 million yuan, to Guilin 80.7 million yuan, to Kunming 107.1 million yuan, to Guangzhou 75.1 million yuan, to Hong Kong 90 million yuan, to Fuzhou 32.5 million yuan, to Xiamen 47.1 million yuan, to Shantou 59.4 million yuan, to Taipei 55.5 million yuan, to Manila 158.8 million yuan. (2) Skymaster aircraft: To Hong Kong 144 million yuan, to Qingdao 42 million yuan, to Beijing 82.5 million yuan, to Chongqing 109.7 million yuan.

### Salary Dispute at Department Stores: Social Affairs Bureau to Mediate Within Days; Management Expresses Determination Not to Disappoint Employees

[Report from Our Newspaper] Ten major department stores in the city, including Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The China Emporium, Lihua, Lian'an Zhonghua, Huaxin, and Taichang (collectively known as "Global Department Stores"), are experiencing heightened tensions due to employees demanding that management fulfill their contracts and implement annual salary increases. Fortunately, the situation has not escalated due to the vigorous efforts of the Social Affairs Bureau and the Department Store Workers' Union. The Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to conduct mediation within the next few days.

After negotiations between labor and management broke down on salary increases the day before yesterday, the Workers' Union, in addition to making vigorous appeals, also requested the Social Affairs Bureau to promptly mediate the matter. Yesterday morning, Xiao Zongjun, the general manager of the Sun Sun Company and representative of the Management Association, visited Zhao Banfu, the Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, to explain the difficulties faced by the companies and expressed that he would immediately discuss remedial measures with the persons in charge of each company so as not to disappoint all the employees.

The China Emporium Closed for One Day

The management of The China Emporium claimed that their business was slower than other companies, so they could not consider the annual salary increase. The company's employees held a group leader meeting the night before last to discuss the matter, and as a result, decided to suspend the inventory count scheduled for the end of the sixth month (held every six months) and sell goods at low prices to show their resistance. Upon hearing the news, the company, in order to avoid losses, closed the business yesterday morning and convened a board meeting to discuss countermeasures. After the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to make vigorous appeals, the employees agreed to cancel the original plan and wait for a resolution. It was originally scheduled to reopen in the afternoon, but because all the employees continued to hold a meeting in the afternoon, the company was closed for one day yesterday. It is expected that business will resume as usual today.

Accident Narrowly Averted at the Sun Sun Company

The employees of the Sun Sun Company had a more aggressive attitude and requested to negotiate with the company management alone. In addition to an annual salary increase of ten yuan, the employees, upon hearing that the department heads of various departments had recently received a 50% salary increase, also requested an additional one yuan increase per year of service. However, after General Manager Xiao of the company persuaded them, the employees voluntarily abandoned the additional request and no longer insisted on direct negotiations, so it is hoped that no accidents will occur.

### Compilation of Workers' Cost of Living Index: Why is it Lower Than the Commodity Price Index? The Municipal Government Explains the Differences to Dispel Public Doubts

[Report from Our Newspaper] The public has expressed dissatisfaction that the workers' cost of living index compiled by the Municipal Government's Statistics Department has not risen as much as the wholesale commodity price index compiled by various parties. There are also doubts as to why the workers' cost of living index is even lower than the cost of living index for civil servants in the Beijing-Shanghai area published by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. The Municipal Government has now explained the true facts as follows: (A) Reasons why the workers' cost of living index is lower than the wholesale commodity price index: (1) The purpose of compiling the workers' cost of living index is to measure the multiple by which the workers' cost of living has increased compared to the base period. Therefore, it is based on the family budget survey of workers. Items that are not essential for daily life are not included in the selection. The wholesale commodity price index covers a very wide range of goods. Therefore, the contents of the two indexes are quite different.

Rationed Prices Far Lower Than Market Prices

Currently, foreign exchange rates are soaring. The prices of goods related to exchange rates and construction have risen significantly. For example, according to the index for the fourth week of June published by the China Economic Research Institute last week, the multiples by which the prices of chemicals, metals, and building materials have risen are very considerable, which has an irrepressible impact on the overall wholesale commodity price index. The prices of rent, electricity, water, public buses, and trams, which are necessities for workers, are greatly different from the general price increase due to the influence of government-approved standards. Furthermore, the prices of necessities that are subject to rationing, such as rationed rice, oil, and sugar, are far lower than market prices, which also has a significant impact on the relatively low workers' cost of living index. (2) The workers' cost of living index compiled by the Municipal Government is calculated based on the average price of goods for the entire month, while the wholesale commodity price index often includes weekly and daily indexes. Monthly indexes are very different from weekly and daily indexes.

Reasons for Differences with Civil Servants

(B) Differences between the workers' cost of living index and the civil servants' cost of living index: (1) The Shanghai workers' cost of living index is compiled based on the results of the family budget survey of workers and is only applicable in Shanghai. The civil servants' cost of living index for various parts of the country includes 29 major items required for exchange of living needs and is applicable throughout the country. (2) The Shanghai workers' cost of living index applies to the Shanghai area, while the civil servants' cost of living index for the Beijing-Shanghai area applies to a very wide area, so the two cannot be compared. (3) The Shanghai workers' cost of living index is compiled and applied in the current month. The civil servants' cost of living index for the Beijing-Shanghai area is based on the previous month's index to determine the payment benefits for the current month. The former is much higher than the latter. For example, the workers' cost of living index for June is 710,000 times, while the civil servants' cost of living index is 420,000 times. (4) The base period for the Shanghai workers' cost of living index is the 25th year, while the base period for the civil servants' cost of living index is the first half of the 26th year. (5) The Shanghai workers' cost of living index uses the total consumption value of the base period in Shanghai as the standard for calculating the index, while the special treatment of civil servants in various places uses the total consumption value of the base period in Nanjing as the standard for calculating the index.

### Fourteen Bodies Unearthed at the Site of the Shanghai Military Camp Fire: Coroner to Investigate This Morning; Recovered Gold Jewelry Sealed

[Report from Our Newspaper] A major fire occurred at the Ximing Lane of Miaohang Road in the Shanghai military camp the night before last, and the details have been reported in this newspaper. It is reported that the fire starter's real name is Sou Dongsheng. As of noon yesterday, a total of fourteen bodies, including humans and livestock, had been recovered. These include Sou Dongsheng, Sou's wife Qin Rongying, eldest son Jinquan, eldest daughter-in-law Shen Aimei, second son Jinquan, second daughter-in-law Qin Liuqing, nephew Runxing, granddaughter Lifen, and the tenants of the pavilion room Tan Lisuofen, daughter Aiqun, a baby who had been born for several days, and Zhang Chen Sanmei, a young woman from Guangdong who had only been in Shanghai for less than a month with Tan, and son Kangnian, as well as a large cat. Yesterday's report that Tan Jizhi, who worked on a landing craft, also died tragically in the fire has been found to be inaccurate. This morning, Zhang Guoxing (who works on the Minjiang landing craft of the Minsheng Company), a relative of Tan, rushed to the fire site after reading the newspaper and said that Tan was still in another city. The work of excavating the bodies yesterday was supervised by Xi Zhenru, the director of the Southern District Fire Brigade, who worked with the fire brigade and police officers to move the rubble. The bodies were all charred beyond recognition. Among them, the young woman Tan Lisuofen was still holding her baby in her arms, which was especially tragic. All the bodies have been transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall on Xinqiao Street, and a coroner will be requested to investigate this morning. Twelve gold rings, six gold bracelets, two silver bracelets, one watch, seven Hong Kong dollars, one silver dollar, a string of small pearls, two Fourth Bank Trust Department passbooks, a deposit slip (totaling one million yuan), and over one million yuan in legal tender (which had been burned) were recovered at the fire site. After the district chief, the fire brigade personnel of the Southern District, and the police officers inspected them on the spot, they were sealed and submitted to the case. It is also reported that, in addition to the back door being closed and nailed at ordinary times, the upstairs drying platform was also densely covered with lead wire mesh over a meter high, presumably to prevent thieves from stealing oilcloth, but unexpectedly this caused a major disaster.

### First Maritime Day: Commemoration Methods Planned

### Postal Boats Forced to Suspend Service: Hoping for Rationed Gasoline

[Report from Our Newspaper] The postal boats Hongjun, Hongxin, and Post No. 3, which are used by the post office to transport mail, have recently been forced to suspend service one after another due to a lack of gasoline and diesel and difficulties in purchasing them. Currently, only the Hongju, which has the smallest carrying capacity, is barely operating. Although the postal authorities have actively tried to find a solution, they have not been effective. If this continues, it will inevitably affect the speed of mail delivery. The bureau is deeply worried and hopes that the relevant fuel authorities can provide gasoline rations so that the Hongjun and other postal boats can resume service and maintain the previous performance of mail delivery.

### Director Yu Sends Letter to Various Colleges

### District Chief of Jing'an Temple District and Others Accused of Fraud

[Report from Our Newspaper] Jin Dehuan, the district chief of the Jing'an Temple District, and Wang Shuqing, the director of the economic section of the district office, and assistants Shen Yi and Wu Shijun, have recently been sued by Jin Shuqin and Zhang Yitang to the District Prosecutor's Office, accusing them of colluding to withhold household registration and rice rations and committing fraud. The indictment states that the rice coupons that should have been issued in the district in June, from numbers 172645 to 173454, were originally intended to be issued to foreign nationals in the district under the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple Police Sub-bureau, but were deliberately withheld by the district office and secretly distributed to residents of the seventh pao in the district. The district office also deliberately withheld 810 rice coupons that should have been allocated to the pao. Moreover, according to regulations, the district office should have completed and reported the rice coupons for the period by the 5th, but the district office also failed to comply with the deadline. The District Prosecutor's Office has scheduled a hearing on the case for the 10th of this month.

### Street Vendor Arrested for Buying Silver Dollars

### Public Utility Companies in This City Complain to the Public Utilities Bureau: Soaring Prices, Increased Expenses, and Greater Losses; Request to Adjust This Month's Prices Earlier

Public utility companies in this city have complained to the Public Utilities Bureau that the rising prices in June have caused a sudden increase in expenses and greater losses. The Shanghai Electric Power Company reportedly suffered losses of as much as 800 billion yuan in mid-January. The day before yesterday, the persons in charge of various companies went to the Public Utilities Bureau to meet with Director Zhao, to explain their difficulties and request that measures be taken to maintain operations. It is reported that the companies hope that the price adjustments for July can be approved quickly and implemented earlier. In the past, the monthly adjustment date for water, electricity, and gas was usually delayed until the 10th, and for trams, buses, small trains, and ferries until the 15th. Moreover, since the additional measures were cancelled, the losses have been even greater. When calculating the new prices according to the automatic adjustment formula, there are further 20% to 30% discounts. The companies feel that they cannot sustain the monthly subsidies. Moreover, the price increases for public utilities in July are bound to be fierce, because the cost of living index has already increased by 110%, and it is reported that the metal index will increase by three times, the rationed coal will increase by more than one time, and other foreign exchange, fuel oil, and other items have also increased significantly.

### Communist Labor Movement Elements Surrender, All Released on Bail

### The Largest Black Market for US Dollars: The Deepest Loophole: Qingdao

— Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi of this newspaper

[Report from this newspaper in Qingdao on the 28th] Qingdao has become the largest black market for US dollars and the deepest loophole in the country. There are a large number of Americans, about five to six thousand. American officials travel back and forth more frequently than Chinese officials. The lives of Americans and Chinese are two completely opposite curves. Thus, a dangerous sense of superiority is growing on the edge of China's coast, completing and reaching various conclusions.

China in June is submerged in a rising tide. The black market for US dollars is rising higher and higher, and the value of "foreigners" is becoming more and more prominent. Just like welcoming Lepke, the black market suddenly jumped over three million. A small civil servant's monthly salary is only worth five US dollars, while an American private's income is 80 to 90 dollars. A captain has a Western-style house to live in. Now, Americans usually call Chinese people "Gawk," meaning "stupid bird." Calling them "Chinese" can be considered polite. Whether Chinese people are "Gawks" is evidenced by the five or six thousand "foreigners" living in Qingdao.

Taipingjiao is the soul of Qingdao in terms of geography and is now full of exotic atmosphere. More than 400 American military families, totaling less than 2,000 people, are still arriving. They are not registered in Chinese police stations. They are part of the US military, enjoy rations from the Port Service Department, and have their own schools. Chinese industries are being bought one after another, and the laying of oil pipelines and small railways does not stimulate much concern. Qingdao Airport is in the hands of Clement and is being expanded by the US 66th Aviation Engineering Team. The project was completed in mid-July of the 35th year of the Republic, fully completed last January, and several buildings have been added this year. Bricks and wood are being continuously transported from the port to the airport.

The need for housing is becoming more and more serious. Rent is as high as 50 yuan per room. Chinese people with real estate rely on this for a living. The US side has asked the Chinese government to suppress rent, but such negotiations will not yield results. Another negotiation involves venereal diseases. At dusk, American soldiers crowd the eighty-odd bars. When military doctors find that soldiers have contracted venereal diseases, they constantly provide the names of those "bar owners" to the Chinese government for negotiation. But there is a difficulty in between. The number of "bar owners" who are truly registered is only a hundred and twenty. Most of them come through smuggling, at least over a thousand.

Do not underestimate them. They are earning foreign exchange for the government. Now, Qingdao has become the largest black market for US dollars in China. It is estimated that at least 300,000 US dollars flow into the black market every month. Calculated at black market prices, this is about 800 billion legal tender, equivalent to two hundredths of the total current currency issuance in China. General speculators travel between Ping and Shanghai to traffic, and there are no fewer than a thousand small vendors who directly engage in the black market to seek small profits. Sometimes they even make the price higher than in Beijing and Shanghai. The government has never been able to prohibit the US military from using US dollars in the market, but when a rickshaw puller or vendor has a few dollars, they are arrested in the name of cracking down on the black market. Nothing is more contradictory than this.

There are several sources of US dollars: the US military and their families use it directly in the market, including exchanging it for black market legal tender. The salaries of 300 Chinese employees and 100-odd foreign employees, rent from private properties. The wages of 1,400 Chinese workers are paid in legal tender. The original wages of each person are calculated in US dollars, but the legal tender issued is higher than the official exchange rate but lower than the black market rate. Some of the sources of this legal tender are the black market. The Economic Emergency Measures Plan is completely ineffective here. The US side needs legal tender in several places and mostly remits it from Shanghai, but the central bank here has not seen any of these 300,000 bills. Unless the so-called "US dollar criminals" are caught and taken to the central bank to exchange them for a pitiful few yuan at the official exchange rate.

The loopholes are extremely large. The global shortage of US dollars and the global black market are reflected so strongly in Qingdao. A major brought six cars to Qingdao last year, earned 30,000 yuan, and then took back carpets from Beiping, earning 60,000 yuan out of thin air. He then retired and went to tour Europe. In April last year, a flood of goods poured in, especially cars. After the news of Kirk selling cars was published in the Shanghai newspapers, the Chinese customs also cried out. The US government restricts soldiers from bringing new cars out of the country, only allowing cars that have been used for more than half a year to be taken out, and they can only be sold after two years. There are still vehicles on the streets of Qingdao today that still have California or Virginia license plates, but these are already the private property of Chinese people. Sanlu Road has become a famous "US Military Market" and is still full of American goods. Citizens have changed the original name of the road in their speech. Black market needs, US dollars, inflation, and special transportation are intertwined to form a beautiful speculative picture. Cornell, a New York car dealer, was the head of the press office of the Fleet Command. After retiring last August, he still lives in Qingdao but often does business in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and even Xinjiang. Some military doctors set up private hospitals after retiring, and the medicine does not have to go through customs.

On the edge of the sea, complex lights and shadows reflect this picture.

### Songjiang Wife-Killing Case

Husband Lan Futing, seeing that the crime was exposed, immediately committed suicide with a knife and fainted to the ground

[Report from this newspaper in Songjiang on the 30th] Lan Futing, a Jiangxi native residing at 85 Cangcheng Street, worked as a wonton seller and lived with his wife, Ms. Xu. On the morning of the 29th, Qian Wang, who lived in the same house, discovered that Ms. Xu had been killed and was lying in a pool of blood. Her husband, Lan Futing, seeing that the crime was exposed, immediately committed suicide with a knife, fainted, and fell to the ground. After reporting to the Dacangqiao Police Station for an inspection, the injured Lan Futing was sent to a public hospital for emergency treatment. Because the injuries were very serious and he had lost too much blood, he was unable to speak and was reported to the Procuratorate for investigation. Ms. Xu's head had been cut four times, and her skull was broken. It was confirmed that she had been killed before death. As for why Lan Futing brutally killed his wife, it must wait for Lan Futing's injuries to heal slightly before he can confess. However, according to rumors from nearby, it is said that Ms. Xu had an affair and was caught by her husband, leading to the tragedy. - This newspaper reporter

### Jin Shaoshan's Predicament

— Hong Zhenglun, Reporter for this Newspaper

[Report from this newspaper in Beiping on the 27th] Jin Shaoshan can be said to be from a "Liyuan (Peking Opera) family." His ancestors were famous in Beijing for playing Dahe Palace plays—that is, puppet shows, about three feet tall, called "Tuo Houren," which were no different from real people. The formal group that performed opera started with Shaoshan's father, Jin Xiushan. The first group he formed was in partnership with Yang Xiangcui, called Bao Shenghe. The second group he formed was with the famous Xiaosheng (young male role) De Junru, called Songzhushe, which performed at Jixiang. Shaoshan was born and trained in the class organized by his father, so it can be said that he came from a family tradition.

Six Months of Serious Illness After the Jixiang Theater was burned down, Shaoshan went from Ping to Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and then to Shanghai. From then on, he became popular throughout Jiangnan and rose rapidly.

Shaoshan returned to Ping during the ten years when war raged everywhere and the iron hooves of the Japanese invaders shattered North China. He fell ill in the winter of the 36th year of the Republic, and it has been more than seven months now. He has also encountered rampant banditry and soaring prices. The "Golden Overlord" has tasted it all.

The disease he is suffering from is peripheral neuritis. In today's era of advanced medicine, this is not considered an incurable disease. As long as he takes medicine in time and receives proper care, he can quickly recover his health.

Sudden Change of Heart When Shaoshan's illness was severe, a group of old friends advocated moving him to Zhonghe Hospital for treatment. Jin Shaoshan also agreed. However, when the 20 million yuan for hospitalization was delivered to the Jin residence, the Golden Overlord suddenly changed his mind. As a result, he is still lying in his own dark ward. The Golden Overlord's reason is: he will die in the main room, and he will never be thrown into a hospital. Until today, if the Golden Overlord does not change his stubborn opinion, he will really only have to wait for death. According to Mr. Zhou, who is taking care of Jin Shaoshan's illness, now that both Chinese and Western medicine are helpless, he was introduced by his old friend Luo Jiulian to a monk, who is now treating him. But it is unknown whether this otherworldly immortal can bring him an elixir from the sea.)

Family Burden Jin Shaoshan's family burden is quite heavy. In addition to two or three partners who live with him, he has two wives: the elder wife, Ms. Yang, is 51 years old, and the second wife, Ms. Li, named Zhuqing, is 29 years old. He has two sons: the eldest son, Dasheng, is 13 years old, and the second son, Miaozi, is 5 years old. He has two daughters: the eldest daughter, Daling, is 10 years old, and the second daughter, Erling, is 9 years old. The second son and the second daughter are both in elementary school. The eldest son, Dasheng, is said to be mentally unsound and is locked at home.

The Age Ending in "Nine" is a Hurdle When this reporter visited him, just as he was talking to him, he suddenly saw a 13- or 14-year-old boy with an iron chain hanging around his neck, with a wooden block attached to it, like a mad dog being locked up. The reporter asked what this was. After a long time, he murmured, "This is Dasheng! Because he is too naughty, we treat him like this." When I saw this, I couldn't help but feel sad. I think there might be a small tragedy behind this! The Golden Overlord is 59 years old this year. According to Mr. Zhou, an age ending in "nine" is a hurdle. I don't know if the Overlord can overcome this hurdle?

### Guo Tianci Extorted Money and Was Caught in Cheng

[Report from this newspaper in Jiangyin on the 30th] Guo Tianci, a native of Taixing, using the title of president of the Jianguo News Agency and liaison officer of the Capital Garrison Command stationed in Cheng, detained Yin Dashou's ash-fertilizer boat at Beiwaizha Bridge on May 21, claiming that the boat was carrying gold bars and other items, and extorted 400 million yuan or two gold bars.

The main culprit, Guo Tianyang, and the accomplice, Wang Guoqing, were arrested outside Beimen and taken to headquarters for interrogation.

### Salt Farmers in Songfeng Strike

One day of shutdown results in a loss of 5 billion

[Report from this newspaper in Fengxian on the 29th] The salt farmers in Songjiang and Fengxian counties along the coast under the jurisdiction of Yuanpu Farm, unable to withstand the pressure of high prices in recent days, suddenly sealed all the salt pans and went on strike on the 27th of this month. It is reported that in the past, ten dan of salt could be exchanged for one shi of rice, but now the price of rice has reached 20 million yuan per shi, while the price of salt is only 800,000 yuan per zu after deductions. Although the authorities of Zhaolin and Nanqiao Yuanpu Farm have tried to persuade them to resume work, and urgently telegraphed the Shanghai Salt Affairs Office, requesting an increase in the farm price, it takes time for official documents to travel back and forth. Therefore, the salt farmers are painfully stopping production and refusing to resume work until they receive a satisfactory response. However, the salt workers in both farms are in the season of sunny weather and high production. The daily output is about 3,000 dan. If calculated at the current market price of 1.7 million yuan per zu, the loss of one day's shutdown has reached more than 5 billion yuan in national currency.

### Illegal Intelligence Agency in Changzhou Recruits Troops and Collects Money Under False Pretenses

[Report from this newspaper in Wujin on the 30th] Recently, there have been many military, police, and political agencies in Changyi County, and the external organizations of various units are also quite complex.

### After the Publication of the Cost of Living Index, Retail Prices Have a New Look

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the city's commodity and securities markets had no formal transactions due to the semi-annual settlement of the silver and money industry, but there were still off-market transactions. Due to the closure of the customs, the money supply was extremely tight, and the black market interest rate was as high as four jiao or more, and prices showed a downward trend. The cost of living index published yesterday showed an unprecedented increase, and on the day of wage payment, various public and private institutions withdrew cash from banks, estimated to be over 1 trillion yuan in total. The tightness of the money supply is the main reason for this. Due to the shortage of funds in the market, prices showed a slight decline. Yesterday morning, the selling price of top-quality white rice was over 19 million yuan per dan, a drop of 20% from the peak. However, in terms of general daily necessities, merchants have adjusted retail prices due to the increase in the cost of living index, and food prices have increased significantly. Pork jumped from 420,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan per catty in one day. The prices of other daily necessities such as oil and charcoal have all taken on a new look, and the lives of ordinary people are becoming increasingly threatened. As for the general prices after the reopening of customs, those familiar with the business situation believe that stability is unlikely unless the authorities strictly control them in advance.

### Fuel Weights Adjusted Again, Kerosene at 13 Million Yuan per Can, Coal Briquettes at 1.9 Million Yuan per Load

The Fuel Subcommittee of the Price Review Committee held a meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from the Fuel Management Committee, the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association, the Fuel and Charcoal Industry Association, the Oil and Grease Industry Association, and the Kerosene Industry Association, among others, attended. The meeting was chaired by Section Chief Zhang of the Price Control Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. The following price adjustments were decided: (1) Kerosene at 118 million yuan per 53-gallon barrel, 13 million yuan per 5-gallon can, and 340,000 yuan per pot, an increase of about 60% from the previous adjustment. (2) Coal briquettes at 32 million yuan per ton from the factory and 1.9 million yuan per load for retail, an increase of about 72% from the previous adjustment. The adjustments will take effect immediately.

### Three Yarn Mills in Violation of Regulations Have Their Membership Revoked

[Report from this newspaper] The Yarn Control Committee previously conducted the eleventh general survey of yarn mills in conjunction with the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, and found that 17 companies, including Huacheng, were suspected of violating regulations. After review by the Committee, excluding Hengfeng, which was involved in a gold bill case and whose books and personnel were handled by the police bureau, the remaining 16 cases were deemed not worthy of further investigation: Dafeng, Wu Xiji, Yisheng, Shengfengfu, Shenyuan, Changfeng Company, Dingdaxieji, Wanfengchang, Huazhong, Huzi Ji, Xintaichang, Hengchangxiang, and Fudachang. Huacheng, Quanfeng, and Jichang were subject to the penalty of revoking their membership in the Yarn Industry Association. It is reported that the Committee has sent a list of the above-mentioned handling to the police bureau for reference.

### There are Still Three Difficulties in the Export of Yarn and Cloth

According to the person in charge of the National Products Joint Operation Company: The recent export of yarn and cloth has not yet shown signs of improvement. The reasons are threefold: (1) The international market price is weak and there are many inventories. (2) The price of the foreign exchange settlement certificate is still far from the black market price, so smuggling has not been reduced, and the profits are higher than legitimate exports. (3) The export costs have increased sharply, making it difficult to circulate funds, and the packaging loans have not been relaxed. Under these three circumstances, it is difficult to be optimistic about the export of yarn and cloth in the short term.

The issue of reorganizing the Yarn Control Committee is still under consideration, and it is said that it will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. Before the legislative process is completed, the status quo will be maintained. Because the Committee's current business is simple, internal plans are to downsize, and more than half of the staff will be laid off. As for whether the Committee will still be under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce after the reorganization, or be transferred to the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, it has not yet been decided.

[Report from this newspaper] The Yarn Control Committee previously allocated 3,000 bales of Indian cotton to the Tianjin office of the Committee for distribution to meet the needs of local textile mills. Two thousand bales of the Indian cotton have arrived in Tianjin. The Tianjin Three District Cotton Textile Association sent a telegram to the Yarn Control Committee yesterday, requesting that the remaining 1,000 bales be shipped north as soon as possible to provide relief.

### Abundant Domestic Production of Caustic Soda: Imports Should Be Stopped Urgently

Regarding caustic soda not being included in the list of items for which imports have been stopped, the Tianjin Chemical Plant under the Resources Committee states: The main products of the electrolytic plant are caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, and bleaching powder. It is quite perplexing that only caustic soda imports have not been stopped. Currently, the Taiwan Alkali Company has over a thousand barrels of alkali stored in Shanghai, with no way to sell them. The Shenyang Chemical Plant has also imported several hundred barrels. The Tianjin Chemical Plant also has six to seven hundred barrels stored in Shanghai and Tianjin. This sufficiently proves that domestic caustic soda production is already very abundant.

### June Oil Quotas Approved by the Import/Export Control Committee

The quotas for diesel, fuel oil, and gasoline for June have been approved by the Quota Allocation Department of the Import/Export Control Committee, with the following amounts: (1) Diesel and fuel oil: $2,702,471.21; (2) Gasoline: $1,296,505.68, of which automotive gasoline is $690,462.36 and aviation gasoline is $606,043.32. The total for diesel and gasoline is $4,998,976.89.

### Cigarette Prices Decline Again

Yesterday, the cigarette market was slightly quieter due to trading houses closing for settlement and tight credit. However, upon opening, the "Ten Great British Cigarettes" showed a bullish trend, with strong demand from retailers. The closing price in the morning soared to 545 million yuan. In the afternoon, the market sentiment softened, sales declined, and some profit-taking occurred, ultimately closing at 510 million yuan, a small decrease of 7 million yuan compared to the previous day. "Old Knife" cigarettes dropped by 16 million yuan. Other domestic and foreign carton cigarettes, as well as listening cigarettes such as "Craven A" and "Three Fives," also declined by varying amounts, ranging from 40,000 to 120,000 yuan.

### Daily Necessities Continue to Rise

Yesterday's market for daily necessities, such as soap, saw many buyers due to the bi-daily settlement of accounts. Holders of goods were unwilling to sell lightly due to the continuous rise in raw material prices. Upon opening, "Gu Ben" soap was bid up to 35.5 million yuan, "Arrow Knife" to 34.5 million yuan, and "Huang Xiangmao" saw transactions at 24.7 million yuan. In the afternoon, there was no shortage of selling at high prices, and the supply in the market was relatively abundant. "Gu Ben" soap fell back to close at 34 million yuan, still up 1.5 million yuan from the previous day. "Arrow Knife" also rose by 1.5 million yuan, while "Xiang Mao" soap fell back slightly by 200,000 yuan. "Guang Hua" soap, due to its relatively low price, was favored by buyers, and the price was good at 24.5 million yuan, with many transactions. Other soaps, such as "Henry Cow" soap, also followed suit with increases ranging from 1.4 million to 1.5 million yuan. Matches also showed a bullish trend. "Beautiful" matches saw particularly strong transactions, with prices rising by 3 million yuan. "Phoenix" rose by 1 million yuan, and other brands such as "Nanjing," "Da Hua," and "Tiger" also showed improvement.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] National Bank officials Xia, Li, and Wang arrived in Beiping at 10:00 AM today from Tianjin and visited Fu Zuoyi. The Shanghai exchange is now open, and coinciding with the end-of-month bank settlement, prices have shifted from rising to weakening.

### Large Quantities of US Aid Materials Shipped to China: Seventh Period Quotas Likely to Decrease

[Our Report] According to sources at the Import/Export Control Committee: The fifth period quota allocation has already begun, and the sixth period is still pending. The seventh period quota numbers have not yet been decided. Because US aid materials are about to be shipped to China in large quantities, and some of these materials conflict with import quota materials, the seventh period quotas are likely to decrease. In addition, the person in charge of the Export Promotion Division of the committee has returned to Shanghai from Taiwan. During this trip, they conducted on-site research on the export of Taiwanese and Fujian native products, hoping to increase foreign exchange income through this.

### Serge Suitings in Demand

The market for woolen, cotton, silk, and yarn fabrics has remained steadily and subtly bullish in recent days. Summer goods are weakening, while winter goods are particularly popular. White serge is far more popular than "Ji Li Ding" and "Pai Li Si." Plain serge is also expensive due to limited output from various factories. Dark blue is the most popular color, followed by grass green. Gray has become newly popular in recent years, and demand from clothing manufacturers both locally and in other areas is strong, with market prices far higher than any other color. Medium-thick serge is a popular item and is gradually coming into season, resulting in demand exceeding supply. This is due to limited output from various factories and continued price increases from the China Textile Corporation, with prices expected to exceed 10 million yuan per yard.

### Market Conditions in Various Regions

Wuxi [Our Wuxi Dispatch, 1st] All markets here are closed due to the sealing of customs and the interest settlement period. However, credit has eased, with underground interest rates falling to 20%, but there is still little demand. Prices outside the market are firm and bullish, all for the opening of customs accounts. White粳 is 18.42 million, 粳稻 is 8 million, wheat is 13 million, white wheat is 13.2 million, flour is 5.4 million, soybean oil is 2.85 million, and cotton yarn is 720 million.

Chengdu [Our Chengdu Dispatch, 1st] Rice prices in Rong (Chengdu) rose again on the 1st. The price limit was raised to 25.6 million for a double-stone measure, and transactions have returned to normal. The black market for gold certificates is rampant again. All the city's banks are settling accounts and are closed for two days.

### Person in Charge of the National Economic Council Discusses Future Trade Policy

The quantity of imports will be limited by exports

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] After the announcement of the "Regulations on the Use of Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates," China's current trade policy must be coordinated accordingly. The business community is paying close attention to whether the import of raw materials can be gradually increased in the future. According to the person in charge of the National Economic Council, Chairman Huo of the Import/Export Control Committee stated at a press conference on June 2nd of this year that one of the trade policies to be adopted in the future to cooperate with the new foreign exchange settlement method is to guarantee that basic industries obtain the necessary equipment imports to encourage the development of national industries. However, the quantity of import trade in the future will be limited by the quantity of export income. In other words, expenditure will be determined by income. Therefore, whether the import of raw materials can be gradually increased depends on whether the source of foreign exchange can be sufficient.

### Industrial and Commercial Dynamics

Private Industry and Commerce Surrounded by Enemies

The more concentrated wealth becomes, the more chaotic the situation becomes, and the pressure on private industry and commerce becomes heavier day by day. This phenomenon is not unique in Chinese and foreign history books. Taking the current situation of the business community as an example, it can also illustrate the general trend. It cannot be denied that the city's private industrial and commercial enterprises have fallen into a predicament surrounded by enemies. The various dynamics of the business community in the past week are enough to prove the worsening of this situation. The larger events are listed below.

(1) Since the Legislative Yuan had a heated discussion on the proposal for a temporary property tax submitted by Legislator Liu Butong and others, the city's business community has been in an uproar. According to the proposed "Temporary Property Tax Regulations," corporate property and personal property will be taxed simultaneously. All operating businesses with a net property value exceeding 30 billion yuan (approximately equivalent to 30,000 yuan before the war) will be included in the tax scope. The tax rate starts at 5% and progresses to 60%, and it is stipulated that this property tax can be paid in kind. Although this temporary tax proposal has not yet been finalized by the Legislative Yuan, judging from various signs, it seems that there is an unstoppable trend. As a result, it aroused a wave of opposition from the city's business community. The City Chamber of Commerce, the City Industrial Association, the Banking Association, the Thirty-Eight Trade Associations, the Industrial Association Preparatory Committee, and the City Council have successively telegraphed the Legislative Yuan to veto the property tax bill. The reason is that although the tax ostensibly uses the amount of property as the standard for collection, the real wealthy tycoons have either already fled the country or have found ways to evade it. Therefore, the actual target of collection is bound to fall on private industry and commerce, which is similar to the "Special Relief Donation" that evolved from the previous property tax. Furthermore, if the proposed property tax threshold is 30 billion yuan, then, according to the price index, all ordinary industrial and commercial enterprises with more than 30,000 yuan before the war must be taxed. If industrial and commercial enterprises with a capital of 30,000 yuan before the war are required to pay a property tax of more than 5%, in the current depressed social situation, the industrial and commercial enterprises will collapse immediately. In addition, the proposed property tax also stipulates that it can be paid in kind. Industrial and commercial enterprises with weak liquidity will inevitably be forced to present their production tools. If this tax is levied, private industrial and commercial enterprises will suffer a fatal loss. Therefore, the City Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association Preparatory Committee jointly telegraphed the President of the Kuomintang and the Standing Committee on Thursday of last week, pointing out the pros and cons, stating, "If the levy of property tax cannot target the wealthy, it will lose the meaning of curbing capital and suppressing magnates. If it is considered that industrial and commercial enterprises are easy to bully and deceive, and it is okay to call a deer a horse and transplant flowers, then it will be difficult to hide the truth from the world, and ignoring reality will inevitably lead to disintegration." The shouting reached this point! In addition, the Industrial Association Preparatory Committee decided to send representatives to Beijing to petition for the veto of the property tax. But what the outcome will be probably requires the city's business community to make greater unity and effort!

(2) The textile industry feels a great lack of raw cotton. According to Wang Lanseng, the acting chairman of the Yarn Control Committee, the country currently has 300,000 bales of cotton in stock. During the period of transition, there is a shortage of 400,000 bales of cotton. If US aid cotton is allocated in twelve months, then only 175,000 bales can be used by the end of October. The shortage of more than 200,000 bales is hopeless unless there is a way to exchange cotton for export yarn and cloth and purchase it. On Wednesday of last week, the Six District Cotton Spinning Association held a board meeting and passed an emergency motion due to the lack of raw cotton, resolving that factories with insufficient cotton in stock and the Yarn Control Committee unable to provide emergency assistance are forced to reduce work by 20%. It seems that the country's leading cotton textile industry must also reduce production to adapt to the situation!

(3) Promoting sales is originally the only way out for private industrial and commercial enterprises. The National Goods Exhibition Conference, which opened recently on the 19th and was sponsored by the China National Products Manufacturers Association, also has this intention. However, while doing their best to promote national products, they discovered a large number of smuggled printed silks and satins with very low costs, which were flooding the market and dumping. As for the issue of the bidding for Japanese woolen fabrics, although domestic manufacturers once protested, it was reported that the China Trust Bureau will continue to bid. Comparing the two sides is a profound irony!

(4) The authorities are indeed eager to try to promulgate new taxes, and they are also sparing no effort to increase old taxes. According to news from Da Gong She, the city's business tax rate was previously determined by the Ministry of Finance to restore the tax rate to 3%, but it was vetoed by the City Council's five general meetings. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the City Finance Bureau and that the tax rate must still be doubled to 3% (originally 1.5%). It can be seen that the so-called veto of the City Council is very weak. The plight of private industrial and commercial enterprises is probably unprecedented!

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Zhang Tianlin, Deputy Director of the National Education Department of the Ministry of Education, went to Beiping to assist in the establishment of the Basic Education Demonstration Zone and returned to the Ministry to report. According to reports, there are 240,000 school-age children in Beiping, only 130,000 are in school, and more than 100,000 are out of school. The central task of the district is to make them enroll in school. Beiping's economy is special, and 70% of the education funding relies on central subsidies. Therefore, increasing schools and adding classes is problematic. The base salary for teachers is only 71 yuan. Their life is poor, but their teaching spirit is very good. However, teaching materials and methods still need to be improved. The students are disciplined and clean, but lack vitality. The Planning Committee of the Beiping Basic Education Demonstration Zone has now been established. The Ministry of Education will subsidize 80 billion, which can add 150 classes and build a new model primary school to accommodate 10,000 students. Before leaving, urged Li Zhaohuan to take up his new position.

### Deputy Minister Hang of the Ministry of Education Returns to Beijing from Hangzhou

Also, after President Cheng Xiaogang of the school resigned and was approved, he came to Shanghai from Beijing to prepare for the handover. Now, because Li has been slow to agree to take office, he went to Beijing again the night before and will return to Shanghai to handle the handover after a formal decision is made on the date when Li will take office. Currently, school affairs are entrusted to Dean Zhou of the Education Department.

### Ministry Orders Jinan University and Haijiang School to Enroll Overseas Chinese Students for Further Education: No More Than 20% of Mainland New Students

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] Because overseas Chinese scattered overseas are restricted by local government regulations, the education of their children is restricted, and more and more people return to China for further education, but most of them do not understand the language of the motherland, and it is more difficult to apply to other schools.

Lost 0-1 to Military League

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 30th] Our World Games football team lost 0-1 to the Singapore Military League team this afternoon, suffering a second defeat in Singapore. During the first half, our World Games team attacked fiercely, proving to be a strong team, but ultimately failed to score. There were two factors contributing to the defeat: one was underestimation of the opponent, and the other was the poor performance of the defenders, which exhausted the forwards. With only ten minutes remaining, the World Games team fought hard to equalize, but due to an excessive desire to score and repeated missed opportunities, they failed. In this match, only the left-sided Liu Song-sheng and left-forward Xie Wen-liang performed their duties satisfactorily.

### Sino-Philippine Baseball Friendship Games: Red Sox Show Their Skills, China Team Ready to Face Them, Opening Ceremony at 3:00 PM This Afternoon at the Racecourse, Wu Mayor to Officiate

[Report from our newspaper] The Red Sox, champions of the Manila baseball league and sports envoys with the mission of fostering goodwill between China and the Philippines and the United States and the Philippines, are visiting Shanghai at the invitation of the Philippine Overseas Chinese Federation to perform. The first game against China, originally scheduled for yesterday afternoon at the Racecourse, has been moved to 3:00 PM this afternoon due to the wet and unusable condition of the field. Mayor Wu has been invited to officiate at the opening ceremony. Admission is free. Players participating in baseball and softball games organized by the U.S. Navy or the International Sports Association can enter the field with their player cards. Guests with complimentary tickets are also welcome.

The visiting team is a semi-professional team organized by the De La Salle University Transport Company in the Philippines. Almost all the best baseball players in the Philippines have been recruited. The nine starters and two reinforcements are all seasoned veterans with over ten years of baseball experience. Pitcher Ocinni has been dominating the Sino-Philippine-Japanese baseball scene for nearly twenty years and can be called the unparalleled player in the Far East. Catcher Ramos was a national player representing the Philippines at the Far East Games held in Manila as early as 1934. Other players such as first baseman Rosa and shortstop Raymond, have participated in international games several times. The team has strong power and can both defend and attack. In the Manila Bay League this season, their batting average reached 0.290, and they only lost twice in twenty-two games.

The Chinese team has not been formed for long. In the local league, they have only lost once to the Air Force, the strongest team. The team focuses on defense rather than offense. Pitcher Yu Chang-luan has struck out 29 batters in four games, making him the second-best pitcher at sea. The other players are either famous players who studied in Japan in their early years or new talents who have emerged in recent years. Their defense in both the infield and outfield is relatively solid, but whether they can stop the Philippine army's sharp edge will depend on the tactics of manager Mei and coach Liang. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

[China] [Red Sox]

Yu Chang-luan Pitcher A. Ocinni

He Jin-ben Catcher Lemos

Bao Guan-da First Base Rosa

Liang Shu-song Second Base Zorf

Liang You-wen Third Base Parrejos

Liang You-sheng Shortstop Raymond

He Jin-gui Left Fielder Salton

Zhong Bao-lu Center Fielder Ocinni Jr.

Liang You-yi Right Fielder Guamca

### Wimbledon Tennis Championships: Men's Singles Final Today, Australia's Bromwich and America's Falkenburg Compete for World Tennis Crown

[Reuters, Wimbledon, 30th] The 1948 Wimbledon Men's Singles Championship will be contested on Friday by Australia's Bromwich and America's Falkenburg. In today's semifinals, Bromwich defeated Hungary's Asboth 6-3, 14-12, 6-2, while Falkenburg defeated America's Mulloy 6-4, 6-4, 8-6. The match between Bromwich and Asboth was a grueling battle lasting two hours and ten minutes. The Australian powerhouse relied on his long baseline shots to gradually wear down his opponent. The two players played without aggression, rarely hitting fierce shots, and instead employing trick shots, making it a unique match not seen on the Wimbledon Centre Court for many years. Both Bromwich and Asboth seemed to be playing according to the textbook, reminiscent of the classic techniques of the early days of tennis. Bromwich won the first set relatively easily, but the second set lasted 85 minutes before Bromwich finally won. In that set, Asboth only led twice, at 4-3 and 8-7. At 8-7, he only needed two more points to win the set, but unfortunately, he failed to do so. In the third set, Bromwich became more and more courageous, ending the match in 17 minutes with a score of 6-2.

The match between Falkenburg and Mulloy was completely modern and explosive, in stark contrast to the match between Bromwich and Asboth. The entire match lasted just over an hour. Falkenburg's victory over Mulloy, the third seed, as the seventh seed, was somewhat unexpected. Falkenburg relied heavily on his serve and volley game to win. It was said that if they had played another set, Falkenburg might have lost. In the third set, the score was tied at 6-6 at one point. Unexpectedly, Mulloy's serve failed, and Falkenburg won with his serve, thus deciding the final fate.

There was an upset in the men's doubles semifinals, with South Africa's Sturgess and Britain's Mottram, who were seeded fourth, losing to Sweden's Bergelin and Australia's Harper, who were not seeded, by a score of 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. In the semifinals, the Bergelin/Harper team will face America's Tom Brown and Mulloy. Special facilities for clinics that do not charge for medical expenses are made to provide the best possible service.

Special clinics are set up to provide free medical services and do their best to serve.

The "Assisted Delivery Movement for Impoverished Women," jointly organized by our newspaper and five major maternity hospitals including Ren He, Shang Xian, Bao Li, Hui Sheng, and the Red Cross Society, has been ongoing since last spring and has benefited over 400 impoverished mothers in the city. This charitable initiative has been well-received by all sectors, thanks to the full cooperation of the participating hospitals. Recently, due to a sharp increase in the number of applicants and the widespread distribution of mothers in various districts, the original five hospitals sometimes had difficulty coping. Last month, Ji Hua Hospital at the intersection of Julu Road and Fumin Road volunteered to participate in the cooperation. The hospital is located in the western district of the city, with a quiet environment, spacious buildings, and perfect facilities. Under the painstaking planning of the hospital director, Dr. Xu Ji-hua, the hospital's work has been steadily improving. This cooperation with our newspaper on "Assisted Delivery for Impoverished Women" will begin today and will undoubtedly benefit the poor in the western district. In addition, the hospital also has an outpatient department, with internal medicine hours from 9:00 AM to 11:30 AM and surgical hours from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. The hospital welcomes impoverished patients introduced by our newspaper for treatment, with medical expenses completely free of charge. Their enthusiasm and perseverance are commendable.

### Talking About Churchill's Memoirs

— Jing Wen

After the end of the war, memoirs and similar materials seem to be quite popular abroad. Following our newspaper's "Hull Memoirs," British wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill's first volume of war memoirs was published in New York on June 21 this year. The book is titled "The Second World War" and is said to have a total of five volumes. It is currently unfinished, and the entire book will probably be published in two or three years, or it may take longer. According to the "New York Times," which published an abridged version of the first volume, the second volume will not be serialized in the newspaper until January next year. The "New York Times" has always been keen to publish good works before the publishers, so it is estimated that the entire book will take at least two or three years to complete.

However, as far as I know, there will be at least three Chinese translations of Churchill's great work appearing in mid-July. One of them is a complete translation, said to have obtained priority publication rights from the original publisher. The other two are abridged translations based on the "New York Times," and the other is published by Nanjing, which is probably also an abridged translation. Generally speaking, it is best to read the original text, followed by a complete translation of the original text. However, I believe that memoirs often contain many documents, so unless they are seriously studied as historical materials, a more appropriate abridged translation is preferable, both in terms of time and resources. Especially in today's difficult publishing conditions and purchasing power, abridged translations have their own objective needs.

The Second World War was a major event in human history, and its impact continues to reverberate today. All current international disputes are still related to the Second World War. In fact, although the war form of the Second World War has ended (in fact, strictly speaking, even the war form cannot be said to have ended. For example, the Allied countries have not yet officially established a peace treaty with Germany and Japan, and are still technically belligerents), its historical factors are still developing. Therefore, it is not yet the time to study this major event from a historian's point of view. What ordinary people urgently need to know are the various inside stories of this major event, that is, so-called unofficial history or foreign history. Therefore, works such as memoirs have emerged.

Although I have likened memoirs to unofficial history, I do not mean to underestimate them. The only difference from official history is that the former is often scattered, unsystematically organized, and the writing attitude is of course mostly subjective, and sometimes it does not shy away from its prejudices. But precisely because of this, readers feel intimate and realistic, and they are more lively than reading those cold official histories. Moreover, memoirs are ultimately different from the general unofficial history, they are indeed valuable materials for future historians.

If the "Hull Memoirs" is the inside story of American politics during Roosevelt's administration, then Churchill's "Second World War" is much broader and more complex in content. Hull was only an American literary politician, while Churchill was not only a veteran of two wars and the leader of the Conservative Party, but also an excellent soldier. His literary and military talents are probably only comparable to General Eisenhower, the current president of Columbia University, but Churchill's political courage is difficult for even General Eisenhower to match. In his memoirs, Churchill wrote that when he took office as wartime prime minister, he proudly said that he did not feel excited or surprised by this great task. He was confident that everything he had done in the past was to prepare him for this day, and he was confident that he was a person who walked with destiny. If these few sentences were spoken by any other person of the time, readers would definitely feel a little nauseous, but looking back at the storms that Britain experienced during the four years of the war against Germany, and finally appeared in the posture of final victory, who said that Churchill should not make such a big statement!

However, Churchill may still have his sadness. At the end of the first volume, he said: "When all our enemies have or will unconditionally surrender, my voters decided to relieve me of the position of managing their affairs." (The general idea is this) The Conservative Party's defeat in the 1945 general election was perhaps unexpected by Churchill. But Churchill's acceptance of the order in times of crisis and his retirement after success not only set off his personal greatness, but also fully demonstrated the democratic style of British party politics.

After reading a few memoirs published by the British and Americans, I was inspired to have an extra-territorial impression. Although there are still people criticizing countries like Britain and the United States as fake democracies or pseudo-democracies, they still have a generation of retired politicians who are willing to use writing to tell us about the war and its inside stories, and sometimes frankly admit their mistakes. Perhaps some people will say that this is still part of the "Cold War," and its purpose is to self-promote. But we should admit that when a person is willing to express himself in writing, his expression process always contains an element of conscience introspection. This is different from purely strategic propaganda texts. For example, the wartime German diplomatic secret documents partially released by British and American diplomatic agencies, and the "historical falsehoods" issued by the Soviet Union in response to this, cannot be as valued as the memoirs of Hull and Churchill because of this reason.

No one can predict when the world will see a scene of singing and dancing; however, I believe that if all the important figures on the international stage can now retire to the countryside and write some of their memoirs, then in addition to their personal reflection, perhaps they can contribute to world peace.

### "The Analects Say"

— Qian Wen

The smashing of the Kong Family Shop has long been regarded as a thing of the past; it is unknown to what extent it was destroyed at that time. Even today, there are still people who care about throwing a few tiles into it, but its destructive power is far less than that of the May Fourth Movement. It is said that the Kong Dao is so great that nothing can accommodate it, but fortunately it has not yet reached the era of "having nothing to accommodate." I have not seriously studied this kind of Dao, so I cannot explain it clearly.

The old gentleman said that it is difficult to raise women. If you just copy out these four words, what is it if not an insult to women? However, I know that it does not refer to my mother, aunts, sisters, wife, daughters, maids, nor does it refer to farmers, workers, or even the social stars "××" and "Flower" and so on, so I don't have any ill feelings towards him. Although he often talked about the righteousness between rulers and subjects, he should not be convicted of anti-democracy. I am not interested in anything he said or did that belongs to the non-modern era, such as going to court and attending meals with the ruler, or entering the ancestral temple. He was unwilling to give Yan Lu his car, which was not a car, and there were no buses, trams, or transportation to take if it was sold.

Since a certain year, Americans have found it fashionable to say the name Confucius, but I don't like to hear Englishmen and Americans talk about him. The British and Americans often think they are right about small things, such as reading the pronunciation of words. They pronounce "Confucius," which is spelled out in Roman letters, a bit like their word "confusion." However, I will never protest to them, because when we call "Homer," only Chinese people can understand it. The English, Americans, Germans, Dutch, French, Italians, and Greeks all have their own names, and everyone thinks they are right.

In recent documents published in the newspaper, many quote the Analects. This does not prove that the Kong Dao is popular, but proves that the legacy of Confucius must be read, even students of science and engineering must read it, otherwise they will not know what they are talking about when the documents are quoted. It is very convenient to quote ancient sayings in speaking, writing, or litigating, especially quoting Confucius. All those who quote ancient sayings will quote those that are suitable for my use. For example, the benevolent will naturally quote "Being rich is not benevolent," while the greedy will quote "Being benevolent is not rich" is inevitable. Ancient sayings can also be slightly modified for my convenience, for example, a loyal and honest elder will say "I would rather someone bear me, than I bear someone," while a traitor will definitely say "I would rather I bear someone, than someone bear me." Those who quote the Analects, because they are the words of the Great Sage and Teacher, the act of modification has not been seen yet.

There should be a principle for quoting the Analects. Let me illustrate with an example. It is acceptable to quote what a gentleman does, but it is not acceptable to quote what a villain does. Saying what a gentleman is like means saying that everyone is a gentleman, saying what a villain is like seems to treat people as villains, so you must be careful. Also, language values auspiciousness. Saying that a country has pursuit is pleasing at all times, but the opposite is bad.

Confucius was a very good speaker. Reading his legacy, I often feel the pleasure of scratching the itch in my heart. This is my personal opinion, and I think it is better not to disclose it. I want to talk about it further, but it is not necessary.

### Anecdotes of Literati

— Jin Lin

The master of humor, Mark Twain, invested as much as possible in machinery in 1929, and as a result, all his property was lost, and he was so poor that he was heavily in debt, leaving only the chimney of the kitchen!

Goldsmith, the author of the famous novel "The Vicar of Wakefield," was arrested for owing rent.

Balzac was also too much in debt, and when he heard the doorbell ringing, he dared not go out to open the door.

### Horse Meat Relief to Europe

— He Dao

Among the relief foods transported from the United States to European countries, there is one thing that accounts for a very large proportion, but it has never been mentioned in official documents - this frozen thing is horse meat.

According to a recent report by American reporter Robert Allen, the total amount of horse meat shipped to Europe last year was more than 100 million pounds. Why ship so much horse meat out? The first reason is that horse meat is cheap, and its price is less than half that of other meats. Moreover, European countries do not seem to have any prejudice against horse meat (Americans do not eat horse meat now). It is said that the people of several countries also think that horse meat tastes fresher than other kinds of meat, and some people say that horse meat is cleaner than other meats. The biggest customers of horse meat are Belgium and Sweden. Recently, in one month, 3 million pounds of horse meat were shipped to Belgium, and 2 million pounds were shipped to Sweden. Other countries such as Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal also have many people who want to eat horse meat.

Americans never ate horse meat until the Great Depression from 1930 to 1932, when slaughterhouses began to kill horses for food; at that time, about 100,000 horses were killed each year. By last year, 300,000 horses were killed in a year to relieve European disaster victims. In the past, the horses that were killed were old and exhausted horses, but recently those old horses have been killed, so the horses that were killed last year were not very old, they were all wild horses. Now many slaughterhouses have been opened, and the largest ones are located in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit.

### "Petition"

— Liu Yun

The word "petition" has now become a common noun. When people make requests or complaints to the government or officialdom, it is called "petition." A written expression of this opinion is called a "petition." According to Wei Lu Suo Ji, the word "petition" comes from the Book of Han. However, the use of the two words together is very puzzling. Suo Ji says: "A certain student of my door wrote a petition of ten thousand words, which he will submit to a certain department. When I read it, many of the words he used were incomprehensible. Not only were they difficult to understand, but the two words 'petition' were also very puzzling. In the Biography of Jing Fang in the Book of Han, Emperor Yuan made Fang the Grand Administrator of Wei County, with a salary of 800 shi, so that he could examine the merits and virtues of governing the county. Fang petitioned that he should not belong to the inspector, and that he should use people from other counties. According to the two words 'petition' are from this, it should be paused when reading. 'Fang Zi Qing' should be one sentence, and 'Yuan Wu Shu Ci Shi' should be one sentence. He迎用 petition, almost misread the Book of Han. I couldn't help but smile." In the world, there are many things that become right by practicing what is wrong, so how can it only be the two words "petition."

### Cemetery

— Min Yi

In the most bustling heart of the city, across from our office where human voices and machines never stop for 24 hours a day, lies a rare and peaceful green space. A low wall, a few scattered clumps of winter green, and a few large trees separate the prosperous and noisy world as if it were two worlds.

It is like a shadow of our building, lonely and hopeless, forever looking up at our busy lives. It is rare to see people during the day, and there is not a single light at night. Only dozens of scattered tombstones on the green space seem to remind people what this place is.

In winter, this area is covered with white snow, but there are no footprints on the snow; in spring, this area is full of green, but there is no laughter from tourists. The light rain in early summer gently washes away the dust on the tomb covers, acting as tears of mourning.

One year, two years, three years, even I am too lazy to take a look, although we are neighbors who look at each other across the window every day

In fact, the lives of the neighbors are not difficult to imagine without looking: some are the most respected husbands of wives, and some are the most beloved children of parents. Maybe it was an old professor who was respected and admired by thousands of students, or maybe it was a big businessman who once dominated the world with the sound of whips and hooves. But now, without any distinction, they let a square cylindrical cover serve as the final symbol, and spend endless years in silence.

They must have experienced being alone on the vast ocean and gone through countless storms in life. They must have also shed tears for the separation of loved ones, rejoiced for the success of their careers, and mourned the death of relatives and friends, but now they are resting in the same place without exception, forced to forget enemies and friends, love and hatred, and waiting for the submergence of the waves of time.

A low wall protects this resting place, day after day, year after year, welcoming it is also a bit dilapidated, and it may collapse at any time. It just guards this resting place of ghosts so expressionlessly, staring blankly at the bustling world, and drawing a faint line between life and death.

### China's New Map Under Compilation (4)

— Fang Jun

Each map still uses layered colors to represent the terrain, but rivers are changed to blue.

The general map will include a world political map, using a broken-line equidistant projection; a Pacific Ocean map, using Mercator projection; and a Eurasia-America map, showing the relationship of the three continents in the Arctic, using a special oblique azimuthal projection. Other general maps for politics, terrain, transportation, geology and soil, agriculture, population, language, etc., will use the equal-area Albers projection, with a scale of 1:15,000,000.

The original compilation draft is at a scale of 1:1,000,000. However, the original map scales are mostly 1:50,000, with a quantity of more than 7,000 sheets. If we only rely on a small number of reducing instruments to reduce them one by one, it would take at least three years to complete the whole process. Therefore, we have to resort to photography. At the beginning, the first step is to recruit a large number of personnel to outline the required locations and terrain on the 1:50,000 originals using thick lines. The photographic method is then used to reduce these twenty times to create small blocks at a scale of 1:1,000,000, each block being 23 mm wide and 18 mm high. These map blocks are then pasted into the projection grid according to the position of the map corner, forming a 1:1,000,000 mosaic map, including all the required points and lines—rivers, contour lines, locations, roads, etc.—which are drawn on non-stretch drawing film. This film is then sent to the map factory of the Survey Bureau for plate making. The original map is reduced by three-fifths to a scale of approximately 1:1,600,000, creating a zinc plate, which is transferred to the projection grid of the intended map sheet using transfer paper. Blueprints are then printed. Each sheet totals four, which will be used to draw the river, terrain, human geography, and highway plates in the future. Each map sheet is mounted on a zinc plate with drawing paper, which avoids stretching and reduces registration errors.

Most of the final drawing work is done on a contract basis, using the spare time of the drawing staff within the institution. As for place names, they are affixed using lead-printed characters. In order to accommodate the common lead-type fonts, village and town annotations use Imitation Song style, while counties and cities still use isoline font.

The above is only a rough description. It is already clear that map compilation is time-consuming and laborious, and certainly not as generally imagined, where hiring two or three draftsmen for a few months can accomplish the entire task. (To be continued)

### An Impromptu Verse on a Visit to Xiang Lake in Xiaoshan

— Qin Bowen

Crossing the river, I gaze my fill at the verdant fields of Yue,
Boundless are the misty waves, as evening gloom descends.
Waves compare West Lake to Xishi,
I suspect I'm here to visit [Ehuang and Nüying]'s spirit on the Xiang River.

Reedy beaches and fishermen's huts naturally form a village,
I cannot believe that Du Fu's soul remains within. (The lake's fish spits bubbles, also called Du Fu fish.)
Double oars at the round bridge, the spring water is broad,
The surrounding mist and emerald green leave no trace.

The beautiful woman is tranquil and good, my thoughts linger, (The residents liken West Lake to famous courtesans, Xiang Lake to refined ladies.)
The lake's water and mountains smile at white hair.
Suddenly, the east wind sends a light rain,
The red mausoleum at the tidal estuary catches the setting sun.

How many lifetimes of cultivation does it take to reach a fairyland,
Traveling all over the upper and lower lakes in all weathers?
Who manages the countless misty [scenes]?
A single peak is deeply beautiful, captivating poetic disciples. (Among the peaks in the lake, Yawu Mountain is the tallest and is popularly called Yawu Lake Mountain.)
