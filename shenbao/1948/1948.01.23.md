### National Economic Commission Discusses and Decides: Foreign Exchange Policy Will Not Be Revised; Measures for Purchasing Export Goods Approved

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] The issue of whether or not to revise the foreign exchange policy was discussed at the routine meeting of the National Economic Commission on the 22nd. Wang Yunwu believed that the current foreign exchange policy had points that could be modified, or even opened up. Pan Xulun, on the other hand, believed that the British foreign exchange policy could be used as a reference, to purchase a portion of export foreign exchange, and that the current foreign exchange policy should be reformed. Zhang Qun immediately stated that revising the foreign exchange policy was a major issue, and its impact could lead to an irreparable crisis. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that the import-export linkage should remain in place with the current methods, and no revisions should be drafted.

The measures for purchasing export goods were examined by the subcommittee of the National Economic Commission on the 17th, and then presented to the full commission for discussion on the 22nd, where they were amended and approved. The full text is as follows: (A) Purchase principles: Export goods shall be handled by merchants in accordance with the government's regulations on import and export exchange settlement, mainly through free transport. However, when merchants encounter difficulties in exporting, the Export-Import Management Committee may decide on purchase measures. (B) Types of goods to be purchased: Tung oil, soybeans, raw silk, egg products, pork, tea, and wool, totaling seven types. Other special local industrial products will also be considered for purchase. (C) Purchasing agencies: The Central Trust of China shall handle the purchases, and may entrust other business agencies to undertake the work. (D) Purchase prices: The Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Auditing Department, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Joint Office of the Four Banks, the Export-Import Management Committee, the Central Bank, and the Central Trust of China shall each send representatives to form a purchase price review committee, which shall be convened by the Export-Import Management Committee. The prices set shall take into consideration the profits of producers as a principle. (E) Purchase quality: The quality of export goods must be standardized, and the Bureau of Commodity Inspection of the Ministry of Economic Affairs shall conduct strict inspections. Profits and losses from exported goods shall be borne by the national treasury.

It is also learned that regarding industrial loans, the Joint Office of the Four Banks may draft specific measures and submit them to the Chairman for approval.

### Implementation Measures for the Commercial and Transportation Sections of the Economic Program Amended and Approved

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] The National Economic Commission held its 31st routine meeting at 3:00 PM on the 22nd. Chairman Zhang Qun and Deputy Secretary-General Gu Yuxian reported on the domestic economic situation in the 36th year and the effects of the government's measures to address the four waves of price increases, making detailed comparisons and analyses, and pointing out the reasons for the increases. They also read out the resolutions of the eighth price conference. Zhang Qun then announced a temporary change to the agenda to discuss: Amended and approved measures for purchasing export goods; Amended and approved implementation measures for the commercial section of the economic reform program; Amended and approved implementation measures for the transportation section of the economic reform program. During the discussion, regarding the original proposal 2 in the commercial section, item 4 of the implementation measures stipulated "Prohibit the import of luxury goods and other unnecessary items, and set a deadline for prohibiting their sale in the market." Some committee members proposed deleting this, arguing that luxury goods should still be allowed to be imported, but only after increasing their tariffs or raising stamp taxes could they be sold in the market. However, this was opposed by the majority of committee members, who believed that the purpose of prohibiting the import of luxury goods and setting a deadline for prohibiting their sale was to save foreign exchange, not to increase tax revenue. The committee members spoke enthusiastically and debated for a long time. In the end, the original regulations were approved. The main revisions to the commercial section are as follows: The five items listed in the original proposal 3, item 5, on promoting import-export joint operations, were deleted; the implementation measures for the original proposal 4, regarding the enrichment and improvement of cooperative business and its connection with international cooperation, will be drafted separately (see the full text of the implementation measures on the first page of this newspaper on the 10th). The main revisions to the transportation section are as follows: In the original proposal 4, item A, "Port management," was retained, and separate measures will be formulated for port management, to be operated and managed separately by the central or municipal competent authorities; all five measures stipulated in item C, "Increase the tonnage of private shipping vessels," regarding "Encouraging private steps," were deleted (see the full text of the implementation measures on the fifth page of this newspaper on the 10th and 17th). The meeting also discussed the implementation measures for the national water conservancy section of the economic reform program. Because the original draft measures had many discrepancies in content and style, they will be handed over to the Ministry of Water Conservancy to draft separate measures.

### No Progress in Sino-British Negotiations on the Kowloon Walled City and Shamian Incidents; Taikoo Guangzhou Liner Service Resumes Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 22nd] There was no progress in the Sino-British negotiations in Nanjing on the 22nd regarding the Kowloon Walled City and Guangzhou Shamian incidents.

### To Improve the Political and Economic Situation in North China, Premier Zhang Invites Petitioning Groups Today to Discuss Concrete Plans; Supervisory Yuan Actively Investigates Malpractices in the Transportation of Grain from the South to the North

Sheng Zhenwei Speaks in the United States: Our Greatest Difficulty is Inflation

[United Press, Los Angeles, 21st] Sheng Zhenwei, Dean of the Law School of Soochow University and a member of the Legislative Yuan, returned to China after inspecting European and American legal systems. He stated here today that the United Nations should establish a security force to prevent any country from interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. The Chinese limitation problem is part of the world problem. The greatest difficulty is inflation. How can inflation be stopped when the war continues? How can the war be stopped? China has been at war for ten years, and we cannot deal with another enemy alone, such as the terrible inflation. Sheng said of his mission, "The Chinese government has decided to make the judiciary acceptable to both Chinese and foreigners alike. This does not mean that we want our laws to imitate your laws, but we hope that our judges and lawyers are familiar with the principles of Anglo-American law, so that Chinese courts can have more understanding when handling cases involving foreigners."

### Negotiations Between China and Mexico on Silver Halt; Hope for US Loan to Stabilize Currency

[United Press International, Washington, 21st] Well-informed diplomatic sources claim that the Chinese government has decided to halt negotiations with the Mexican government regarding the minting of new silver coins. They state that instead, their hopes are placed on a currency stabilization plan. This plan was brought to Washington by Mr. Pei Tsu-yi, head of the Chinese technical delegation, seeking the endorsement and assistance of the United States. Mr. Pei has not yet had the opportunity to present the plan, which requests the United States to provide $300 million as a "stabilization fund" to serve as reserves for issuing new Chinese currency. Sources say that during discussions with US officials, Mr. Pei will request that the US prioritize the stabilization fund, with other forms of assistance being secondary. The US is currently attempting to provide a large portion of long-term assistance in the form of goods and reconstruction machinery. However, the Chinese believe that implementing the agreed-upon fund measures simultaneously would be more effective. Sources also state that silver negotiations between China and Mexico began last autumn but were later denied by the Chinese Ministry of Finance because the Kuomintang did not fully believe that purchasing silver would yield satisfactory results. They claim that the negotiations may have involved the Mexican government minting silver coins worth approximately $250 million to $300 million for China to replace nearly worthless Chinese paper currency, with China repaying Mexico with goods. However, these sources also state that Kuomintang financial experts believe it is unwise to allow Chinese currency to be manipulated by fluctuations in the silver market; therefore, the current negotiations with Mexico have never been given much attention. They claim that these negotiations have now effectively halted.

**Pei Tsu-yi's Mission**

Concurrently, reliable Chinese and American sources claim that opinions differ greatly between US officials and the delegation led by Mr. Pei Tsu-yi regarding their true mission here. According to these sources, the Chinese believe that Mr. Pei has some direct authority regarding the issue of the US lending China over $300 million within 15 months, but the Americans believe that Mr. Pei's delegation is merely a delegation engaged in purely technical discussions, as speculated externally. They state that the Americans have indicated that they deeply hope Mr. Pei and his colleagues can provide advice on the detailed issues of implementing the American plan, but the Americans have not considered whether the Chinese side has any say in policy consultations. They point out that Mr. Pei's delegation has only had one contact with State Department officials at a luncheon on the 19th, followed by a meeting in Assistant Secretary of State Thorp's office in the afternoon. There were no meetings between Chinese and American officials on the 20th and 21st; Mr. Pei's delegation only met with lower-ranking technical officials. According to sources who participated in the meeting on the 19th, the discussion was only a general discussion of the Chinese economic situation, but neither side suggested any specific measures. At the same time, it is said that members of Mr. Pei's delegation hope that the American aid-to-China plan, which is scheduled to begin in April for 15 months, can be increased to $500 million. However, Americans unanimously believe that the Chinese people's interpretation of figures that is beneficial to them may be wrong.

**Differing Opinions Between China and the US**

Some Chinese officials here still hope that, in addition to foreign aid, the Chinese government may also be able to persuade the Export-Import Bank of the United States to approve loans under its previous plan related to the $500 million loan. Chinese and American officials hold extremely different views on how to promote economic recovery. It is not yet clear this week what impact this difference of opinion will have on the final form of the US-limited plan. However, Mr. Pei's delegation still hopes that they can influence the final decision of the United States to some extent. So far, Mr. Pei has not met with Secretary of State Marshall or Undersecretary Lovett. He has no power over any plan. At the same time, some members of Congress are now using pressure on the State Department to advocate for aid to China. Congressman Judd claimed that unless the State Department submits the plan to Congress soon, he will publicly demand that the government announce the aid-to-China plan.

### Our Technical Representatives Meet with US Officials; Secret Discussions on Aid-to-China Plan; Hoover Suggests Including China in Foreign Aid Bill

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] Relevant sources state that the US aid-to-China plan is currently being discussed here "secretly" by our technical representatives and the US State Department. At 10:30 a.m. on the 21st, our delegation, led by Mr. Pei Tsu-yi and Mr. Li, held a meeting with US officials at the US State Department, during which a preliminary "technical discussion" of the aid-to-China plan was conducted. The State Department explained that the talks between China and the United States cannot be strictly referred to as negotiations, as informal discussions must be conducted outside the State Department from time to time. It is also said that because discussions between US officials and foreign representatives involving financial assistance plans in the past have all been conducted in secret, the discussion on aid to China this time is no exception. The State Department also insisted that in the preliminary talks, State Department officials only listened to the Chinese delegation's report on China's financial situation and what steps the Chinese government has taken to improve this situation. It is rumored that since arriving here on the 15th, our representatives have not submitted any plans or requests to the US side. It is not yet known whether our government intends to submit a plan to the US State Department. It is also said that the discussions have not yet reached the stage where the US State Department will show the Chinese representatives a draft of its aid-to-China plan. Well-informed sources say that before the State Department submits a final request to Congress, the Chinese delegation will be given the opportunity to see a blueprint of the State Department's plan, which will list an amount exceeding $300 million.

[United Press International, Washington, 21st] Former President Hoover, on the 21st, asked the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to expand the scope of the Marshall Plan to include China, Japan, Korea, and Germany, and to further reduce the initial $6.8 billion in European recovery funds for the first 15 months. Mr. Hoover claimed that this would not weaken the US economy or undermine world recovery. All $3 billion in aid to Europe for food, coal, fertilizer, and cotton should be provided as grants, as unsecured loans are unlikely to be repaid. It is unwise for the four-year aid-to-Europe plan to be accompanied by spiritual constraints; we cannot force independent and autonomous nations to accept any ideology. In addition, a joint committee of Democrats and Republicans must be established by both government and civilians to manage aid affairs in 16 European countries, China, Japan, Korea, and Germany.

[US Information Service, Washington, 21st] Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, publicly released a letter to Secretary of State Marshall on the 21st, which called for the immediate submission of the aid-to-China plan to Congress. (Continued on page 2, column 1)

Our newspaper, Nanjing, 21st dispatch, after receiving instructions from London, the British Embassy in China sent a document to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs containing four demands regarding the unfortunate incident in Shamian, Guangzhou: 1. The Chinese government should take responsibility for the Shamian incident; 2. Thoroughly investigate the cause of this unfortunate incident and severely punish the perpetrators; 3. Compensate for the losses and provide relief to the British nationals who suffered damage; 4. Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. At the same time, according to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 20th, British Minister of State McNeil also mentioned the Shamian incident when answering questions from members of the House of Commons, and stated that the British government had made four demands to the Chinese authorities: compensation, investigation, punishment of the perpetrators, and guarantees; enough to prove the accuracy and authenticity of this newspaper's report. The Shamian incident occurred as a result of the Kowloon incident. Our diplomatic authorities have repeatedly negotiated with the British government regarding the Kowloon incident, but London has remained silent. Now, suddenly presenting four demands regarding the Shamian incident first, attempting to shift the focus of negotiations to the Shamian incident, we cannot help but think that the British side has an attempt to "put the cart before the horse." British diplomacy has always been known for its ruthlessness. Our diplomatic authorities must raise their awareness and must not handle the Kowloon incident and the Shamian incident, which have a causal relationship, separately.

We calmly and objectively discuss the matter as it stands. The occurrence of the Shamian incident was entirely due to the atrocities of the Hong Kong police. Without the Kowloon incident, the Shamian incident would not have occurred. The reason is very clear. Therefore, not only is the Chinese government not responsible, but the entire responsibility should be borne by the British government. In terms of legal principles, the jurisdiction of Kowloon City belongs to the Chinese government, which is a fact that the British government cannot deny. The Hong Kong authorities' demolition of houses in the old city of Kowloon is not only illegal but also infringes upon our country's sovereignty over Kowloon City. The Hong Kong police's shooting at unarmed residents is an unforgivable atrocity. Even if we disregard legal principles and consider human feelings, after the war, both China and Britain are in difficult and arduous periods, and both are advocating thrift in the economy and seeking the stability of people's livelihoods. The Hong Kong authorities, ignoring the suffering of the Chinese people, intend to demolish the houses in the old city of Kowloon in the name of "hygiene" and "fire prevention" and turn them into parks. Its impracticality and inappropriateness are obvious. The Hong Kong side may say that it has designated other areas to allow the original residents to build houses, and there is a remedial measure. However, it seems that we should no longer insist on not moving. But in today's material conditions and widespread poverty, building houses elsewhere is not an easy task. The Hong Kong side, not only failing to empathize with the suffering of the Chinese people but also using violence to drive them away, is an act that, no matter from which angle we observe it, cannot but be considered a re-exposure of the face of British imperialists.

The Hong Kong side's treatment of the residents of Kowloon fully exposes the imperialist style of dealing with colonies. It is difficult for the Chinese people, who are striving for independence and autonomy after the war, to tolerate it, especially the general intellectuals, who have long demanded that the government recover the special status of Hong Kong and Kowloon so that China will no longer have any defects in its territorial integrity. Therefore, anti-British demonstrations have occurred one after another in Guangdong, Shanghai, and other places. The blame lies in the British side's infringement of our sovereignty and the Hong Kong police's atrocities. The British government cannot blame any party. And the burning of the British Consulate in Shamian was an excessive action taken by the communists using mass movements. The authorities have obtained sufficient evidence. The Shanghai British-owned newspaper North China Daily News's editorial on the 19th, "Communist Agitation," also admitted that this was done by the communists and said that the communists' intention was not only to disrupt local order but also to contain a conspiracy to provoke and expand the unfortunate incident between China and Britain. During this period of suppressing the rebellion, preventing the communists' disruptive actions is indeed the responsibility of the Chinese local governments, but the Hong Kong side created the incident, aroused the anger of the Chinese people, and caused mass movements, and villains took the opportunity to cause chaos. Temporary measures were difficult to prevent. Moreover, after the Shamian incident occurred, the Chinese government immediately ordered all local governments across the country to step up prevention of communist sabotage and to strictly protect the lives and property of British nationals. Although students in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and other places also held anti-British demonstrations, no similar unfortunate incidents occurred in Shamian. It can be seen from this that the Chinese government is not responsible in reality, and a study of the origin of the chaos lies in the atrocities of the Hong Kong police, which has led to the occurrence of the Shamian incident. No matter how strongly the Hong Kong side argues, it cannot shirk its responsibility for the occurrence of the Shamian incident in the end.

As for punishing the perpetrators and providing compensation, the communists' taking the opportunity to cause trouble not only hinders local order but also undermines Sino-British relations. The crimes they have committed can be punished in accordance with our country's criminal law. Fortunately, the perpetrators who set fire to the British Consulate have all been arrested and can be handed over to the court for handling in accordance with the law. However, we must state that punishing the communists who committed arson is our country's internal affair and does not allow outside interference. Britain cannot and should not demand that our country severely punish them. Based on this, Britain's proposal of this demand is indeed an unfriendly move, and our country cannot possibly change it. Secondly, there is the compensation for the losses of British nationals. British nationals are fine. It is unfortunate that they have suffered accidental damage. Standing from a humanitarian position, we should sympathize with them, and we can consider providing compensation for their losses, but it must be handled in accordance with international practices. Mr. Shi, Director of the Information Department of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has already stated that our foreign party authorities will handle this matter in this way, which is a clear arrangement.

The British diplomatic authorities' abandoning the Kowloon issue and proposing four demands regarding the Shamian incident are truly inappropriate actions. Not only is it putting the cart before the horse, but it not only cannot resolve the outstanding issues between China and Britain but also makes Sino-British negotiations take a turn for the worse, which may have an adverse impact on the future of Sino-British relations. We cannot but express our regret over this. Since then, under the leadership of the Labour Party, the British government's enlightened measures in both domestic and foreign affairs have been applauded by the world. In particular, Britain's Far East policy is not only able to adapt to the situation but also has a long-term vision. Its allowing India and Burma to become independent has been something that previous British governments did not dare to do, but the Labour Party has done it. We cannot but admire Prime Minister Attlee's wise decision. Hong Kong and Kowloon should be returned to China. Not only does the United States recognize this as a matter of course, but even enlightened British people also believe so. However, the Labour government has been slow to fulfill its gentleman's agreement to return Hong Kong and Kowloon to China, and retaining this stain in Sino-British relations has left us greatly puzzled. Some British people may say that China's internal unrest has not yet ended, and the return of Hong Kong and Kowloon must wait for the future. This statement is truly unreasonable. Frankly speaking, what does Britain's return of Hong Kong and Kowloon have to do with China's internal affairs? It is clearly a disguise. Therefore, we ask the British diplomatic authorities to broaden their horizons and look far ahead. On the one hand, they must see the current situation in the Far East clearly. On the other hand, they must also have self-awareness. Should Britain continue to adopt imperialist policies in the Far East after the war? Is it worthy of retaining its pre-war colonies? Because we cherish the warmth that Britain gave us during the war, we are especially willing to maintain friendly relations with Britain and do not want the Kowloon incident to escalate. Britain should also think about it for both China and Britain. How can the old hatred of a century of hostility be allowed to exist? How can the spirit of the equal new treaty not be respected? To put it bluntly, Britain should adopt a more conciliatory attitude towards the Shamian incident, turning major issues into minor issues, and minor issues into no issues. How can it raise demands to agitate the emotions of the Chinese people at a time when Chinese people's emotions are running high? In short, the British diplomatic authorities need to reconsider these two incidents.

### Bridges' Letter to Marshall

(Continued from page 1) Bridges stated in his letter: "Only by immediately submitting to Congress a plan to protect the significant concerns of the American people for China's independence can we create good public confidence in the authorities' Far East policy and enable us to have ample opportunity to carefully study the aid plan."

Bridges recalled that Marshall, in his joint report to the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees in November last year, had said that a definite aid-to-China plan was being prepared and would be submitted to Congress as soon as possible. Bridges said that Assistant Secretary of State Sepp had reported to the Senate Appropriations Committee on December 17 that the State Department was prepared to submit a China plan at the beginning of the Congress' regular session. Bridges claimed in his two letters: "It has been two weeks since the regular session of Congress opened, and the State Department has not yet submitted an aid-to-China plan to Congress. Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, relying on the statements of Your Excellency and Mr. Sepp, have had their actions affected by the temporary aid plan."

Bridges reminded Marshall that General Wedemeyer, representing the President's special investigation of the situation in China, testified during the Appropriations Committee hearing that he did not believe that the United States had fulfilled its promises to China in recent years, and said that he believed that the United States should provide China with military supplies and economic assistance, which was now a matter of urgency. Bridges claimed that the replies made by White House, Director of the State Department's Far Eastern Affairs, were full of "evasions", giving people the feeling that "the government is not being frank with the committee". Bridges continued in his letter: "The government's sincerity in dealing with China and in dealing with Congress on the China issue is now in doubt. Moreover, the important interests of the American people have been harmed by our government's inaccurate assessment of the post-war situation in the Far East. The government seems to regard the Soviet Union as a 'peace-loving democracy' and the Chinese Communists as merely agrarian reformers, and it has refused to grant export licenses for the shipment of arms and ammunition to the Chinese government for a year, all of which are sufficient to undermine the results of our victory over Japan. Today, the Soviet government is using the Chinese Communists as a tool, threatening to dominate all of China. The war within China has now become a war of bloodshed, starvation, and destruction."

### North China Petition Delegation Continues to Visit Various Ministries; Reports to the Resident Committee of the Senate (Continued from page 1)

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The North China Petition Delegation, a group of five people, continued to negotiate with various agencies on the 22nd. In the morning, they attended the temporary meeting of the Resident Committee of the Senate. Chairman Mo Dehui and the representatives spoke and reported one after another. All the senators expressed deep sympathy and decided to formulate a proposal to be submitted to the central government for careful consideration to improve the social and economic situation in the north. At around 3 p.m., they went to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Because Minister Zuo was in Shanghai, Deputy Minister Zhou Chang presided over the meeting and broadly exchanged views on issues such as northern land reclamation, agricultural and fishing implements, and agricultural loans. It was agreed that large-scale machinery such as tractors and well-drilling machines suitable for the North China Plain should be supplied to the north as much as possible, and the ministry should hand this over to the Land Reclamation Office for handling. As for the agricultural loan issue, it was agreed to discuss with the petition delegation towards the Agricultural Bank and the Four Joint Offices. They visited the Ministry of Social Affairs and were received by Deputy Minister Huang Bodu. Huang said that the Ministry of Social Affairs has always been extremely concerned about the situation in the north. The rice previously handed over by the Executive Headquarters has been decided to distribute 2,000 tons to the north. It has now arrived in Shanghai. It has been decided that Hebei Province will be allocated 700 tons, Tianjin and Beiping 350 tons each, and Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan a total of 600 tons, which are being shipped north in batches. They then visited the Ministry of Water Resources, National Defense, and Health. In the evening, they attended a banquet hosted by General Manager Shou of the Cooperative Bank. At around 8 p.m., they had a two-hour meeting with Mr. Miao Jiaming and Mr. Bao Shu to discuss in detail the food distribution plan of the UNRRA. The flour among the American grain that has now arrived in Shanghai will be transferred to the north for distribution in Tianjin and Beiping. However, the conversion rate is quite a problem. The Ministry of Food has set the rate at 49 pounds of flour per bag, equivalent to 4 dou of rice. The northern representatives believe that the supply of a small bag of flour is only about 2 dou. The conversion rate is unfair. Mr. Miao and Mr. Bao said they had no preconceived notions and will negotiate with the Ministry of Food again on the 23rd. As for the import and export issue, Committee Member Huo Zhongwei said that since he had just taken office, he would do his best to alleviate the difficulties in the north after he was familiar with the business. The representatives asked him to pay attention to the social and economic background of the north. If exports are not smooth, the countryside will face the danger of being strangled. If the government handles the unified purchase and sale, the price must be reasonable. Otherwise, the tragedy of the people of Hubei and Ezhou in the 33rd year of the Republic of China cutting down tung trees and selling them as firewood may be repeated. On the morning of the 23rd, they will visit the Ministry of Finance. If there are no gains, they will have a lunch hosted by Chief Secretary Wu Tiecheng.

### The First Ambassador to Burma, Tu Yuntan, Arrives in Shanghai; Talks about Promoting Sino-Burmese Relations

[Our City News] Dr. Tu Yuntan, our country's first ambassador to Burma, arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd after paying his respects to Chairman Chiang and asking for instructions. When meeting with reporters, he said that the chairman had given many instructions on promoting Sino-Burmese relations. The chairman said that we should do our best to help our neighboring countries so that they can all gain freedom and independence. China and Burma shared difficulties during the war, and they should be especially close in the future. Mr. Tu elaborated on his thoughts on Burma's independence. He said that Burma's independence is undoubtedly the most exciting news for Eastern countries. This move will make the world more deeply understand the trend of Eastern nations striving for independence. Regarding how to promote Sino-Burmese relations, he said that based on our country's consistent good-neighborly and friendly policy, we will first devote ourselves to connecting emotions and increasing understanding so that we can both see each other sincerely. Secondly, we will sign a Sino-Burmese friendship and trade agreement and resolve boundary disputes. He also explained that the biggest purpose of signing a friendship and trade treaty is to protect the legitimate rights of overseas Chinese in operating industry and commerce and to fight for equal treatment for overseas Chinese. Regarding the two pending cases of boundary disputes and the return of overseas Chinese, Mr. Tu said that boundary disputes will be resolved fairly and reasonably through consultation based on treaties and international practices, and the return of overseas Chinese has been largely resolved. Regarding the promotion of overseas Chinese affairs in Burma, he believes that we should promote the unity of overseas Chinese, improve the level of education, and make overseas Chinese abide by Burmese law, give Burmese people a good impression, and fully cooperate with Burmese people economically. He said that our country currently only has a consulate general in Yangon. In order to respond to the needs of the situation, the government is now considering adding a consulate in northern Burma. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Tu suffered from a severe cold and has been delayed for medical treatment. As soon as he recovers, he will leave Shanghai to take up his new post in Burma.

[United Press International, Guangzhou, 22nd] U Ohn, the first Burmese ambassador to China, arrived here from Yangon on the 22nd and is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 23rd and then to Nanjing to present his credentials.

### Manila Chinese Hawkers Forcibly Relocated by Philippine Police

[Central News Agency, Manila, 21st] Twenty-four Chinese hawkers in a Manila market were forcibly relocated by the police today. After resisting relocation for sixteen hours, the police drove them away. Three other Chinese hawkers quietly left upon seeing the Philippine police approaching aggressively. The remaining hawkers did not even go to the market, and their stalls have already been occupied and taken over by Filipino merchants. More than seventy policemen were involved in this operation. It is said that the eviction action will continue until the 25th of this month, until all 1,182 Chinese hawker stalls have been taken over by Filipinos.

There was also Dai Yunzhang, a 75-year-old member of the Education Association who had been teaching for more than 50 years, who also went to vote. The fishermen's association voters came from the Haihe boat people, who were simple and sincere and revealed their eyebrows. The labor union was the strongest organized, and the chamber of commerce was the most united. They all went to vote collectively.

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 22nd] It snowed heavily in Xi'an last night, and it did not stop all day on the 22nd. Although it was the second day of the Legislative Yuan election, the voting was even worse than yesterday due to the cold wind and snow. It is expected that the election may be extended by half a day on the 23rd.

[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 22nd] It snowed heavily on the 22nd, but the citizens voted enthusiastically in the Legislative Yuan election, no less than yesterday. Chen Xun, Huang Shaogu, and Chen Bosheng received the most votes from the press. In both elections, no candidate asked for help at banquets, because those who serve in the city mainly eat sorghum.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 22nd] Although there was heavy snow and raging winds on the 22nd, the electoral mood was even more enthusiastic than yesterday. Chairman Wang went to Huangting to vote at 10:00 a.m. Voters braved the strong wind and snow and went to various polling stations very enthusiastically, lining up in long queues and voting in order. The order was good.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 22nd] There was heavy snow in Qingdao and the Shandong Peninsula on the 22nd. The candidates were campaigning intensely and hired many cars and trucks to facilitate voters to vote. A total of more than 340,000 regional election votes were cast, about half of the votes were cast. The lawyers group cast 55 votes in total, which had been completed on the 22nd.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 22nd] It was bitterly cold on the 22nd, and the voters were greatly hindered. The press cast a total of 35 votes. Chen Xunian received 15 votes, Chen Bosheng and Huang Shaogu were second, and Hu Jianzhong, Luo Dunwei, and Shi Wenjin received two or three votes each. On the 23rd, Chen Bosheng and Huang Shaogu will fight with the basic votes of the Central News Agency branch and the Heping Daily, and the competition will become fierce.

### Britain and France Suggest to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg: Form a West European Security Alliance; British Foreign Secretary Criticizes Soviet Expansionist Policy

[Our Newspaper] London, 22nd Broadcasting: British Foreign Secretary Bevin warned the House of Commons today that the world is facing "serious danger." He said that the Soviet Union's various statements about Greece are purely fallacious, and accused the Soviet Union of using all its strength to expand its power. The Soviet Union's previous goal was limited to controlling the Communist Party, but now it has expanded to Western Europe. The Soviet Union pointed out that British foreign policy is increasingly close to the United States, and its intention is to do so. Bevin said that British foreign policy has three principles: 1. No country should control Europe; 2. The old concept of balance of power should be broken; 3. European countries should cooperate to achieve recovery.

[Reuters] London, 22nd: Foreign Secretary Bevin gave a two-hour speech at the beginning of the two-day foreign policy debate in the House of Commons on the afternoon of the 22nd. The main points are as follows: 1. Western Europe: clarification on the Anglo-American Frankfurt Agreement; 2. European Alliance: Bevin will announce that Britain and France have suggested to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to conclude an alliance to abolish tariff barriers and establish a Western European security system; 3. Important actions that Britain will take in Palestine; 4. Answer to the Soviet Union's criticism of British policy; 5. The Marshall Plan.

[British Information Service] London, 22nd: Wartime Prime Minister Churchill attracted the attention of the entire House of Commons when he attended the House of Commons. Anti-Liu Party leader Churchill is in excellent health. When he entered the House of Commons during an inquiry, the questioning member and the respondent both welcomed him. It is expected that Churchill will make an important statement in the foreign policy debate, because he has always advocated that European countries should have close ties.

[Reuters] London, 21st: Diplomatic sources here believe that Britain and France have decided to suggest to the governments of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to expand the 50-year treaty of the Anglo-French defensive alliance signed by Britain and France in Dunkirk on March 4, 1947. As for the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, although officials cannot confirm that this proposal has been formally submitted to the governments of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, well-informed sources believe that the previous report is reliable. It is reported that Bevin and Pideau will both make important foreign policy speeches in their respective parliaments on the 22nd, when they will mention the expansion of the defensive alliance treaty. The reason why the officials are silent on the previous statement is probably because of this.

### West European Defensive Pact Confronts East European Alliance

Well-informed sources also believe that the governments of the five countries have already engaged in informal preparatory negotiations to prepare for the expansion of the alliance treaty. When Bevin signed the Anglo-French alliance treaty in Dunkirk last March, he traveled to Moscow to attend the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. When passing through Brussels, he had already discussed the possibility of concluding a similar alliance with the Belgian government. Later, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg established a customs union, and their relationship became closer. Therefore, the expansion of the alliance to the three countries has become a natural development. When studying the importance of this move, diplomats believe that if the five countries establish a defensive alliance, they will strengthen the security of Western European countries that have been invaded by Germany through a long-term defensive treaty. The security needs of France and its smaller northern neighbors can therefore be met. On the other hand, the expansion of the alliance to the five countries is equivalent to the establishment of a "Western European Group" based on military treaty obligations, which is what the Soviet Union fears most. In fact, although the conclusion of the West European defensive pact is officially announced to prevent German aggression, its establishment closely follows the expansion and establishment of the East European alliance network. The latter's officially announced goal is also to prevent German aggression. Furthermore, the Anglo-Soviet Agreement of 1942 and the Anglo-French Agreement of 1944 both have provisions for linking the eastern and western treaty systems, but before the German issue is resolved, the hope of realizing this connection is slim.

### Marshall Discusses Aid to Europe Plan, Believes U.S. Army Department Has Provided Full Cooperation, Latin America Will Still Receive Aid

[U.S. News] Washington, 21st: Secretary of State Marshall discussed several aspects of the current world situation at a press conference today, including Britain's note on food shortages in the British and American occupation zones of Germany, France's attitude towards economic cooperation in the British and American zones, the situation in Palestine, the role of Latin America in the European recovery plan, and other issues related to the European recovery plan.

This press conference coincided with the one-week anniversary of Marshall's inauguration as Secretary of State. He said that he had only remembered this matter so far. He also jokingly said that he seemed to have been in his current position for a year and a half, rather than just one year. Regarding Germany: Secretary Marshall allowed early consideration of the note from British Foreign Secretary Bevin regarding food shortages in western Germany. The content of the note was not revealed in Washington, but according to unofficial sources, the note expressed concern about the unrest among German workers due to food shortages. Marshall said that the note was still under study and that how to respond had not yet been drafted, but the U.S. government agreed with Bevin's opinion on the seriousness of the food shortage. He said that he was very interested in the suggestions made by Bevin, which were to obtain fish from Scandinavian countries to supplement Germany's diet. When Dulles raised questions on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, he mentioned that the American military occupation authorities had failed to cooperate in the economic recovery of Western Europe. Marshall replied that in his view, the Army Department in Washington and the American military government in Germany had never taken any action that hindered the recovery of Europe. According to Dulles, he suggested to the Senate Committee that if the administrative power was transferred from the Army to the State Department, it would be easier to include western Germany in the European recovery plan. Marshall assured reporters that the Army Department was well aware of the significance of the European recovery plan and had taken a completely cooperative attitude. He pointed out that representatives from the Army Department had participated in the various committees drafting the European recovery plan. Marshall has indicated that the State Department may assume administrative responsibility in July. He said that he had reached an understanding with French Ambassador Bonnet regarding the agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States on the economic control of the British and American occupation zones, and refused to provide further explanation. He also refused to comment on the Syrian military operations in Palestine. He replied to a suggestion made by Palu at the Senate Committee report meeting on Monday to amend the European recovery plan, saying that he had not had time to study it. Although he believed that this suggestion was a natural matter, he said that it was inappropriate to express dissatisfaction that Latin America was not included in the European recovery plan, because according to the European recovery plan, billions of dollars would be used in Latin America, and this would undoubtedly have a good effect.

Hoover Leads Republicans, Will Attack Aid to Europe Plan

[Associated Press] Washington, 22nd: At the urging of former President Hoover, Taft and 20 other Republican leaders met on the 22nd to discuss major issues and amend the Marshall Plan. Hoover had submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a scathing critique of the Marshall Plan. He refuted the government's aid to Europe plan point by point. He suggested that Truman's first-phase Marshall Plan request of 6.8 billion be reduced by 4 billion. It is generally believed that the enemies of the Marshall Plan will immediately gather around the "Hoover Plan" to launch an attack on the government. Taft told an Associated Press reporter: "Hoover's opinion is very correct and coincides with my previous views."

Hoover Opposes Aid to Europe Suggestions, Truman Expresses Opposition

[Our Newspaper] New York, 22nd Broadcasting: Washington News, President Truman firmly opposes the suggestions made by former President Hoover on the European recovery plan. The president was unwilling to give reasons, but told reporters that it was very clear that these suggestions could not be applied. However, Mr. Du agreed with the opinions offered by his political senior, Balufu, earlier this week, that the United States should form a defensive alliance with the countries participating in the Marshall Plan.

[Our Newspaper] New York, 22nd Broadcasting: Washington News, Donovan, the former director of the U.S. wartime Strategic Services Bureau, testified on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today that the Soviet Union has launched a global "provocative war" and that the Marshall Plan must be strengthened to deal with it. The Soviet Union has achieved significant success with the help of intentional workers, traitors, and latent enemies, and by exploiting suffering and famine. A formal outbreak of war between the United States and the Soviet Union is not inevitable, but another kind of war is already underway. This war is not being waged by the Red Army, but by the Soviet Communist Party and the fifth column in various parts of the world.

### Marshall Tells Greek Ambassador to the U.S., U.S. Attaches Importance to the Situation in Greece, Paying Attention to the Supply of the Greek Army

[Reuters] Athens, 21st: Reliable sources say that Secretary of State Marshall replied to a memorandum recently submitted to the United States by the Greek Ambassador to the United States, saying that the U.S. government is studying every measure to face the development of the situation in Greece. Secretary Marshall told the Greek Ambassador that he was personally paying close attention to the supply issues of the Greek Army. He will do his best to enable the Greek Army to effectively deal with the "Markos" rebellion.

### The Iraqi Government Announces: Non-Ratification of the New Anglo-Iraqi Treaty; Difficulties in Implementing the Palestine Partition Plan

[United Press International, Baghdad, 22nd] After an hour-long emergency meeting between the Iraqi Regency Council, the speakers and deputy speakers of parliament, and the King, a nationwide broadcast announced that Iraq would not ratify the new Anglo-Iraqi treaty, as it failed to guarantee the country's rights.

Reuters also reports that the Iraqi Regent has telegraphed Iraqi Prime Minister Jabr, who went to Britain to sign the new Anglo-Iraqi treaty, to return to London immediately. The Iraqi people have been demonstrating against the treaty for days, and newspapers have been critical of it. The National Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, and the Independence Party are all opposed to the treaty.

[Reuters, Baghdad, 22nd] The Iraqi cabinet is expected to resign.

[Special Dispatch from Chenggong Lake, 21st] The British Empire notified the United Nations on the 21st that, for security reasons, Britain must continue to restrict Jewish immigration to Palestine and refuses the United Nations General Assembly's request to open immigration ports. This British plan was proposed by the British representative, Sir Alexander Cadogan. Cadogan stressed that Britain would continue to limit Jewish immigration to the Holy Land to 1,500 people per month until the end of British rule. Therefore, Britain must prevent refugee ships from docking at Tel Aviv before a settlement is reached.

According to a United Press International report, the United Nations Palestine Committee has encountered difficulties from the outset in implementing the Palestine partition plan and has had to report to the Security Council. The committee will report to the Security Council early next week on the various difficulties it is currently facing.

[United Press International, Jerusalem, 21st] Six hundred to seven hundred Arabs attacked the Jewish quarter of Tuham for two days. On the 21st, after several hours of fierce fighting with the British, they were driven back to the Lebanese border. This was the first large-scale and organized attack by Arabs since the opposition to the partition of the Holy Land.

### The US State Department Is Ordered to Release the Contents of German Secret Archives: The Soviet Union and Germany Once Discussed Dividing the British Empire

[United Press International, Washington, 21st] Today, the State Department, under the order of Secretary of State Marshall, released 260 secret files of Nazi Germany, totaling 362 pages, which were seized by British and American forces. The details of the Soviet Union's constant attempts to collude with Hitler to divide Eastern Europe were completely exposed.

Among them were records of conversations between Hitler, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke. Hitler and Ribbentrop had advised Matsuoka not to negotiate a Soviet-Japanese treaty with the Soviet Union, encouraging Japan to send troops south to attack Singapore. The conversation records contain Ribbentrop's words: "Roosevelt knows that attacking Japan is impossible, so he will not declare war on Japan because the Japanese army attacks Singapore. Japan can take the opportunity to occupy the Philippines, which will severely damage Roosevelt's prestige." Hitler promised that Germany would fight alongside Japan if the United States declared war. The secret files regarding the Soviet Union can be summarized into the following facts: The Soviet Union provided a large amount of support to Germany in its war against the West, providing hundreds of thousands of tons of supplies, constantly seeking Germany's "friendship," and helping Germany to keep Turkey neutral. The Soviet Union and Hitler agreed to exclude the United States and Britain from Europe, Asia, and Africa. The Soviet Union demanded military bases within the Bosporus and the Tatar Strait and that the oil fields from Batumi and Baku south to the Persian Gulf be recognized as Soviet interests. This led to the split between Germany and the Soviet Union and foreshadowed Germany's subsequent invasion of the Soviet Union. The first of these secret files is the official report of the Soviet Union's initial attempt to establish a closer relationship with the Nazis. The Soviet Union prevented its release during the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal's trial of German war criminals. Among them was also the secret pact signed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Ribbentrop to divide Poland and delineate the spheres of influence of Germany and the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe. The last item relates to Hitler… The State Department said that this attack on Berlin… parts have been copied and presented… This action… with the United States… and made public, is indeed an important diplomatic… One of them, marked "Extremely Urgent, Extremely Secret," was a confidential report from the German ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, dated November 26, 1940, stating that Molotov agreed to sign a four-power (Germany, Italy, Japan) political and economic cooperation treaty, but only if his four conditions were accepted, one of which required Japan to relinquish its rights to the coal and oil fields in northern Sakhalin. Another document is a record of Hitler's conversation with Schulenburg on April 28, 1941, stating: "When Minister Matsuoka visited Moscow, I was there, and I asked the Russians for their opinion on the Soviet-Japanese agreement. I replied that the Russians were very happy, even if they had to take a step back. Stalin told Matsuoka that he had an agreement with the Nazis and had not planned to cooperate with Britain and France."

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] German secret archives reveal that Molotov and Hitler discussed dividing the world into German, Soviet, and Japanese spheres of influence and dividing the British Empire.

After the US State Department released these documents, other secret documents of the German Foreign Office obtained by Britain, France, and the United States will be released successively. They are being compiled by one person each from Britain, the United States, and France. When announcing this intention of the British, American, and French governments, a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office specifically stated that this action was only to show the historical importance of these documents and had no political implications. He also welcomed the Soviet government to participate in this work.

### After Free Elections in Korea, All Occupation Forces Will Withdraw: United Nations Delegation Offers Guarantees

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 21st] The chairman of the United Nations delegation to Korea, Menon, stated in a broadcast to all of Korea tonight: "In the upcoming elections, all Korean people will have complete electoral rights, otherwise, the United Nations delegation to Korea will pack up and leave Korea." He said, "We would rather leave than become part of a meaningless, deceptive election."

Observers also said that this principle must apply to both South and North Korea. This delegation does not merely recognize North Korea's intrusion as a political deformity that must be eliminated. From our perspective, Korea is an indivisible whole. He assured the Korean people that after free elections, there would be a withdrawal of all occupation forces within Korea. He said, "Foreign troops, in the best of circumstances, are still a stimulating factor; in the worst of circumstances, they are a threat." He said that the United Nations delegation to Korea has completed its basic preparations for its duties and is now ready to begin dealing with the Korean problem.

### If the Soviet Union Withdraws from North Korea, the United States Has Plans to Respond: Commander of US Forces in Korea Announces

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 21st] The commander of the US occupation zone in Korea, Hodge, told reporters today that South Korea has been liberated for two and a half years, and although the United States has repeatedly provided assistance to this new and divided country, it is still economically dependent on Japan. General Hodge admitted today that it is impossible to promote economic independence in the southern Korean region alone. Hodge refused to comment on what measures would be taken if Soviet troops withdrew from the north. Recently, people in Seoul said that the US military has no intention of withdrawing abruptly without prior notice, but Hodge stated that the US military has plans to respond to any situation at any time.

### US Treasury Secretary Advocates for Stabilizing Western European Currencies

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] US Treasury Secretary Snyder, while attending the House Foreign Affairs Committee's review of the European Recovery Program today, presented his views on the program, advocating that European countries participating in the program take swift and vigorous measures to stabilize their currencies. After the European countries have completed these appropriate steps, the United States will provide loans in addition to the aid it intends to give to Europe, to purchase materials under the European Recovery Program. He advocated that the agreement between the United States and each European recipient country stipulate measures to stabilize that country's currency and maintain appropriate exchange rates. He acknowledged that adjusting exchange rates is an extremely complex issue and expects it to be achieved in the process of European recovery.

### Cologne Workers Return to Work

[Reuters, Cologne, 22nd] 80,000 workers in Cologne, who went on strike on the 21st to protest the lack of food, resumed work on the 22nd.

They went on strike to demand the same food rations as heavy laborers. There were no disturbances in the Cologne area during the strike.

### US Army Department to Request Six Hundred Million Dollars from Congress to Aid Japan and Korea; American Businessmen Go to Japan to Prepare to Invest in Industry and Commerce

[Central News Agency, Washington, 22nd, United Press International] According to well-informed sources, the US Army Department will request Congress to allocate $250 million for the economic recovery of Japan and Korea in the fiscal year beginning July 1. In addition, it will request $350 million for civilian relief and the prevention of "disease and unrest" in the two regions. The source declined to reveal the exact amount allocated to Japan and Korea but said that 75 percent of it may be transferred to Japan's recovery needs.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd, Special Dispatch] According to the Jiji Shinpo, a group of 120 American businessmen is scheduled to come to Japan next month to investigate the possibility of investing in Japanese industry and commerce. The newspaper did not disclose the source of the information. It was also learned from reporters that officials of the Allied General Headquarters are conducting a broad survey of previous foreign investments to provide information for foreign businessmen who will be coming to Japan. The Japanese government is currently making various preparations to receive this group of American businessmen, hoping that they will invest in Japan and assist in Japan's industrial recovery.

### Katayama's Policy Address Is Extremely Vague

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] The Japanese House of Councillors is scheduled to hold a plenary session at 3:00 PM today (the 22nd). After Prime Minister Katayama's policy speech, Secretary-General Ohno issued a statement saying: "Today's policy speech by Prime Minister Katayama, although covering a wide range of areas such as industry, inflation, and administrative reorganization, is divorced from the current situation and is merely a sermon. Although he spoke of increasing production and revitalizing industry, there were no concrete measures. This is the fatal flaw of his speech, which violates the hopes that the people have for politics and the economy."

### Matsuoka Yosuke Makes False Statements, Huang Xianqian Refutes

[United Press International, Nanjing, 22nd] Director of the Information Bureau, Dong Xianqian, commenting on the Washington-revealed secret Nazi documents stating that former Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke had "private contact" with President Chiang in 1941, said that President Chiang had not met with Matsuoka Yosuke since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing in 1927. Dong said that since the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, President Chiang has never received any Japanese, and Matsuoka's words are false.

### Freedom of the Press Clause Drafted by UN Subcommittee

[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 21st] The United Nations Subcommittee on Freedom of the Press today completed drafting the freedom of the press clause to be included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which stated: "Everyone has the right to freedom of thought and expression; this includes freedom from interference in holding opinions and freedom to seek, receive and impart information by any means, regardless of frontiers."

### French Cabinet Holds Emergency Meeting to Discuss Franc Devaluation; Britain Opposes Franc Devaluation Measures

[Reuters, Paris, 21st] Key members of the French cabinet and financial experts convened an emergency meeting tonight. The Governor of the Bank of France, Monick, and experts from the Ministry of Finance attended to discuss the status of the franc. Although no communiqué was issued after the meeting, it is understood that the French government's plan for an indirect devaluation of the franc has been shelved due to the British government's statement that a public market price for the pound and other foreign currencies in Paris would hinder the position of the pound.

### United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information and the Press

— From Our Newsroom

The United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information and the Press is scheduled to be held in Geneva, Switzerland, on March 23 of this year. The conference is expected to last four or five weeks, depending on the progress of discussions. Each United Nations member state may send five regular representatives, five alternate representatives, and several expert advisors. Representatives will include "persons actually engaged or having extensive experience in newspapers, radio broadcasting, films, and other media for the dissemination of information." The United Nations currently has more than fifty member states, each sending ten regular and alternate representatives, totaling over five hundred people. Non-member states may also send representatives to participate, but they will not have the right to vote. In terms of the professions of the attendees, the conference will undoubtedly be full of talent and very grand.

Dr. Zhang Pengchun, the representative of our country to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, recognizing the importance of this conference, in addition to reporting to the government for instructions, also convened a symposium in October last year while traveling on the first China National Aviation Corporation flight between China and the United States to the United States, to explain the nature of this conference so that they could bring the message of the conference's mission back to the country and arouse the attention of the press.

The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution on December 14, 1946, to convene an international conference on freedom of information. The Economic and Social Council also passed a resolution at its fifth session on August 15, 1947, to proceed with convening the conference. These two resolutions are the basis for the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information. The preparatory work that our country's representatives should do should also take the main text of these two resolutions as a guide. The first resolution contains provisions for freedom of information, conditions for achieving freedom of information, and the personnel that should be present among the representatives of each country. The second resolution contains the organizational methods of the conference, the provisional agenda, the date of the meeting of the Subcommittee on Freedom of Information of the Human Rights Commission, and the submission of a report to the Economic and Social Council, as well as discussions on dealing with the shortage of newsprint. The provisional agenda is very comprehensive, and the principles and issues listed have been carefully reviewed by experts from various countries in the aforementioned Subcommittee on Freedom of Information. When the conference is held in the future, this agenda will be the subject of discussion and debate. At present, what our country's delegation should prepare is everything contained in these two resolutions and the agenda.

The aforementioned Subcommittee on Freedom of Information is the body that planned this conference. On January 19, the subcommittee met to discuss the concept of freedom of information, which is a difficult problem to obtain the agreement of all parties. On February 22, the Economic and Social Council will hold its sixth session. It is still difficult to predict what resolutions will be made at that time. If the Subcommittee has a new report on the concept of freedom of information to offer the Council for discussion, then the Council will have a corresponding resolution, and the content of the resolution may be a subject for research and preparation by the press of various countries. Before the conference is held, we cannot, of course, make affirmative inferences, but it can be asserted that the results of the conference are worthy of our attention.

When the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information is held, in accordance with the resolution of the fifth session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council last year, five committees must be established under the plenary session to handle the affairs of the conference. One is the General Committee. The organization of this committee consists of the chairman of the conference, the vice-chairman, and the chairmen of the various committees, and its main task is to submit recommendations on the agenda to the plenary session, issue various draft resolutions to the main committees, and coordinate the work between the committees. In addition to the General Committee, there are four main committees that specialize in the technical aspects of conference affairs. The first committee will discuss the basic tasks of news and other information agencies, the principles of freedom of information, and other general issues shared by the main committees. This committee is responsible for reviewing item 1 of the provisional agenda (general discussion on the principles of freedom of information), item 2 (basic principles that information agencies should pay attention to when collecting, transmitting, and broadcasting information without restrictions), and item 6 (reviewing the drafting of the charter of the rights and obligations of information agencies). The second committee will discuss issues related to the collection of information and international transmission, and its main task is to review item 3 of the provisional agenda (measures to facilitate the collection of information) and item 4 (measures to facilitate the international transmission of information). The third committee will discuss issues related to the free publication and reception of information, review item 5 of the provisional agenda (measures on free publication and reception of information), and item 8 (how to enable other countries to receive information after the establishment of official or semi-official information offices). The fourth committee will discuss legal issues and continuing institutions, and its work is item 6 of the provisional agenda (reviewing the drafting of the charter of the rights and obligations of information agencies), item 7 (reviewing whether a permanent institution can be established to promote the free flow of accurate information), and item 9 (reviewing what action should be taken to make the conference's recommendations most effective, whether to use General Assembly resolutions, international conventions, bilateral agreements, or for countries to formulate appropriate laws themselves, or use other methods), and must also resolve the legal issues submitted by other committees.

Before the representatives of our country leave the country, it is best to prepare a proposal in advance and distribute it to the representatives of various countries before the conference begins. Proposals from other countries can also be obtained in advance, which will facilitate discussions and responses.

The origin, nature, date of the meeting, past discussions, and the agenda for future meetings are introduced below:

Origin of the Conference: According to the Charter of the United Nations, its main organs are the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, the International Court of Justice, and the Secretariat. The United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information and the Press was decided and approved by the General Assembly on December 14, 1946, and instructed the Economic and Social Council to proceed with convening it.

Nature and Date of the Conference: Freedom of information and the press is one of the basic human rights and is also a major factor in promoting world peace and progress, but at the same time, it is often necessary to avoid abuse, seek facts, and avoid bias in order to create a sound world opinion and seek international understanding and cooperation. Therefore, the purpose of the General Assembly's decision to convene a conference on freedom of information and the press is to formulate opinions on the rights, obligations, and customary practices of the concept of freedom of information; the representatives should be persons actually engaged or having extensive experience in newspapers, broadcasting, films, and other media for the dissemination of information; the date is set for before the end of 1947 and held at a location selected by the Economic and Social Council so that the Council can submit a report to the next regular session of the General Assembly.

Establishment of the Subcommittee: Under the Economic and Social Council, there is originally a Human Rights Commission. The Human Rights Commission decided to establish a Subcommittee on Freedom of Information and the Press at its meeting on January 20, 1947. The Subcommittee held its first meeting in Chenggong Lake, New York, from May 19 to June 4 of the same year.

The Process and Recommendations of the First Meeting of the Subcommittee: Zhang Pengchun represented our country at the meeting. The important issues discussed by the committee were: the date of the meeting, it was proposed to postpone it to March and April 1948; the location was proposed to be in Europe, or Prague, Czechoslovakia, or Geneva, Switzerland, or Paris, France, to be chosen by the Council; the number of representatives in each delegation was limited to five regular representatives each. In the organizational meeting, a General Committee and four main committees were set up. At that time, the draft agenda was discussed for the longest time, and the reason was that the governments managed the collection, transmission, and publication of information differently in different countries, and opinions were therefore divergent, causing great debate. The Soviet representative criticized the wording used in the agenda, believing that it violated the tendency of the Charter to protect the internal sovereignty of various countries. At the same time, representatives of other countries also criticized it, believing that the wording was too bland, and that the cancellation or relaxation of information restrictions, as well as the reduction of national interference in individual freedom, could not fully meet the instructions of the Council. Therefore, when the agenda was put to a vote, the request for reservation was made more than once. Second, the concept of so-called freedom of information was reviewed, and representatives from the United States, Norway, Britain, and Czechoslovakia all gave explanations, but there was no discussion. Next, the relationship with the International Telecommunication Union was proposed, and it was proposed that the Secretary-General of the Council be prepared to contact and invite it to participate. Later, the shortage of newsprint was discussed.

Resolutions of the Council: The Economic and Social Council, based on the report of the Subcommittee, met on August 15, 1947, to discuss and amend its recommendations and established the following resolutions:

Date and Location of the Meeting: Changed to March 23, 1948, in Geneva.

Provisions for Voting Rights: The exercise of voting rights is limited to member states of the United Nations.

Non-Member States Invited to Participate: Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Ireland, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Pakistan, Portugal, Romania, Switzerland, Transjordan, Yemen. (Note: This is a resolution from August 15 of last year. Some of them may have joined as members now.)

Specialized Agencies, Intergovernmental Organizations, and Non-Governmental Organizations Invited to Attend:

Specialized agencies that have concluded agreements with the United Nations are: the International Labour Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and the International Civil Aviation Organization.

Intergovernmental organizations that will conclude agreements with the United Nations are: The International Bank for Reconstruction, and the Development of the International Monetary Fund, the International Refugee Organization, the International Telecommunication Union, the International Trade Organization, the Universal Postal Union, and the World Health Organization.

### First Batch of Reparations Materials Arrives: Grand Reception Ceremony Held; Zhang Huabang Wharf Decorated with County Flags and Colorful Ribbons; Excitement and Enthusiasm; More Than Four Hundred Pieces Are Machine Tools and Other Machinery

[Reported by this newspaper] The Hae Kang, transporting 453 pieces of Japanese reparations machinery back to the country, entered the Wusongkou at approximately 7:00 AM yesterday and docked at Zhang Huabang Wharf at 8:30 AM. A reception ceremony was held at the wharf at 10:30 AM. Attendees included Qin Fen and Hu Shiyuan from the Supervisory Committee for Reparations Materials, Ouyang Lun from the Ministry of Economic Affairs representing the receiving agency, Jiang Yijun from the Resources Committee, Li Weicheng from the Ministry of National Defense, Zhang Yuanlun from the Ministry of Communications, Wang Zhiche from the Ministry of Education, and guests Xu Xueyu, Zhang Xuesui, and Chen Yuzhen, totaling several hundred people. Zhang Huabang Wharf was decorated with flags and colorful ribbons, and several red and green arches were built, creating an atmosphere of excitement and enthusiasm.

### Commencement of National Reconstruction and Revival: Hopes for Wise Utilization

The ceremony commenced amidst firecrackers and music. Chairman Qin Fen began with a speech, stating: In the past, defeated nations compensated victorious nations with money. However, the experience of the First World War proved that this method only made it impossible for defeated nations to bear the burden, leading to another war. Therefore, the United Nations decided to adopt a more reasonable approach, compensating in a way that does not hinder the basic living needs of the defeated nation's people. Japan first extracted a portion of its military industrial equipment for reparations, half of which was allocated to our country, while the other half was divided among the Philippines, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Today, as we receive the first batch of machinery, it marks the beginning of our national reconstruction and revival. It is hoped that the government and the people will work together to utilize it well for construction. Regarding the distribution method, some advocated that it should all be compensated to factories in the rear areas. However, the government believes that the entire nation suffered losses during the war of resistance, so everyone should have the right to enjoy compensation. Therefore, a portion will be allocated to state institutions, and a quarter will be transferred to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for resale to private factories. Compensation for civilian losses will be distributed after the machinery is appraised.

Justice Finally Triumphs over Might

Guests Xue Sui and Xu Xueyu delivered speeches one after another, both believing that obtaining compensation in materials was not easy. They hoped that all receiving agencies would avoid waste and properly utilize it for reconstruction and revival.

Yu Runsheng, Director of the Ministry of National Defense, representing the receiving agencies, expressed his delight and gratitude for the cooperation of all sectors. He also believed that our country's acquisition of Japanese reparations demonstrated that justice would inevitably triumph over might. After the speeches, the entire group took a commemorative photo and toured the Shanghai Wheel. This historic ceremony was successfully completed.

Two Ships Participate in Loading Materials

According to reports, our country received over nine thousand seven hundred pieces of reparations materials. Yesterday, the Haikang transported four hundred and fifty-three pieces, all of which were lathes, drilling machines, iron beds, and other machinery. Each piece varied in size, weighing between two and eight tons. The Haikang completed loading in Yokosuka in three days and nights. At the same time, the ship brought to Shanghai three overseas Chinese and one family member of a member of the delegation stationed in Japan. It is expected that all the materials will be unloaded by the afternoon of the 23rd.

It is reported that in the future, in addition to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Xingshu Shipping Company and the Yixiang Shipping Company will also dispatch ships to Japan to transport reparations materials. The Yongxing of the Zhongxing Company is scheduled to depart for Yokosuka on February 3rd, with a capacity of four thousand cubic feet. The Limin of the Yixiang Company is scheduled to depart for Sendai on February 4th, with a capacity of three thousand cubic feet.

### Mees Speer Case Opens for Third Trial; American and Dutch Diplomats Attend Hearing

[Our Newspaper Report] The case of Mees Speer, a Dutchman and manager of Ebbes Company, for illegally operating in the black market for foreign exchange, was previously sentenced to one year in prison by the High Court in the second instance. Mees appealed, and the Supreme Court sent it back for retrial. The third trial began yesterday, and was heard by President Yi Dingzhi of the High Court at around 3 p.m.

Mees Speer appeared in court to be questioned. Mees's defenders, lawyers Chen Tingrui and Cai Runian, Deputy Consul Tuole of the US Consulate General in Shanghai, Dutch Consul General Midobur, and Zhang Tianyin, legal advisor to the US Consulate, attended the hearing. Witnesses Shi Jiusen, Shao Shunqing, Babotes Taissitai, Baotana, Kang Paike, and accountant Xie Chunpu, all employees of Ebbes Company, testified. The Supreme Court sent back the case for retrial because it was necessary to investigate whether the US$40,000 and HK$20,000 in the account books were foreign exchange margin or black market foreign exchange. The US dollars seized were US$2,110 more than recorded in the account books. Xie, the accountant, testified that the US$40,000 and HK$20,000 were indeed margin. As for the US$2,110, it was impossible to examine because it was not entered in the account books. Mees Speer stated that the money was loose change from the US$300,000 in inventory, kept outside for use, and was not for sale. The court found that in the accountant's examination of the accounts, US$57,860 had been sold by Ebbes Company, which accountant Xie confirmed. Mees Speer also admitted this without hesitation. After the witnesses testified, lawyers Chen and Cai stood up to defend him. The hearing concluded at around 5 p.m., and Mees was released on bail, with a retrial scheduled.

Afterwards, Sun reported the incident to the Putuo Road Police Sub-bureau, and pointed out the surnames of the four assailants. The police dispatched officers to arrest the suspects, Liu Meiyuan and Zhang Demei. Zhu Shubing and Fa Kun fled. Unexpectedly, this aroused the public outrage of all the workers. At around 11 a.m. yesterday, about sixty people gathered to storm the sub-bureau to inquire about the reason for the arrest.

### Price Increase for Two Railway Tickets Imminent; Yu Dawei Says It Will Be Implemented in Short Term

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Regarding rumors of a price increase for tickets on the two railways, the reporter asked Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei on the evening of the 22nd. He said that since the adjustment of wages and the increase in coal prices, the expenses of the two railway bureaus have increased by 60 billion yuan per month, so adjusting prices is inevitable.

### Public Utilities Bureau Convenes Meeting of Power Plants; Power Generation Not to Be Reduced; Install Capacitors for Neon Lights

[Our Newspaper Report] The Public Utilities Bureau convened a meeting of representatives of various power companies yesterday, and passed three important resolutions: 1. The coal shortage is serious. Starting next month, the amount of coal allocated to each power company will be allocated according to the limit. However, the power generation of each company must not be reduced. 2. The electricity saving measures passed by the Senate have only saved more than 10,000 kilowatts since implementation, which is far from the expected target of saving 20,000 kilowatts, so the electricity saving measures should be strengthened. 3. Users of fluorescent lamps and neon lights will be forced to install capacitors, because installing capacitors can reduce power consumption by half.

Family Settlement Fees Borrowed and Not Yet Returned

He believed that the results of handling the preferential treatment funds for strong young men last year were unsatisfactory. As of now, less than 10 billion yuan has been received for preferential treatment funds for strong young men exempted from conscription, because two-thirds of the strong young men who applied for exemption have been approved, and 8 billion yuan still needs to be returned. Only 1 billion yuan has been received for preferential treatment funds for households without strong young men going to war. As for the originally planned donation of 20 billion yuan from wealthy merchants, only 2 billion yuan has been received so far, which is far from the target. As a result, more than 10 billion yuan in settlement fees borrowed from the Four Banks and Two Bureaus by the Military Service Association has not yet been repaid, and the amount of interest payable is also considerable.

Compiling Report on Collecting Preferential Treatment Funds

The Military Service Association previously dispatched personnel to various districts to urge the collection of preferential treatment funds for strong young men exempted from conscription and for households without strong young men going to war, together with the Shanghai National Guard District. Each stage of the work has been completed, and detailed reports on the collection situation and achievements in each district have been prepared and sent to the Association. The Association will forward them to the Municipal Government, and award or punish them separately according to the merits of the collection.

### Green Handbag Hides Face; Bright Red Nails Stained with Oil; "Foreign Girl" Regains Freedom; Shen Gongzang Detained for Robbery

[Our Newspaper Report] The scandals between "Foreign Girl" Li Zhen, a red dancer, and Shen Gongwei have been endless. Recently, Shen's wife, Mao Xiuzhen, twisted her to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Sub-bureau on charges of adultery. They were escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation at around 11 a.m. yesterday. Shen is married to Mao Xiuzhen and has two children, one two years old and one still in swaddling clothes. However, Shen does not work and likes to wander around. He lives with Li at No. 4, Lane 1112, Yuyuan Road. Although the two often quarrel, they soon reconcile. At around 11 p.m. on the 20th of this month, after Shen and Li finished dancing, Shen invited Li to a drinking establishment. Li drank too much, so Shen took Li back to Shen's residence at No. 549, North Shaanxi Road in the same car, and went to sleep in Shen's father's bedroom. The matter was discovered by Mao, who reported it to the Judicial Section of the Jing'an Temple Road Police Sub-bureau for investigation. On the suspicion that Shen and Li were committing adultery, they were escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday. Li was wearing a blue silk cheongsam with white polka dots, a leopard-skin fur-lined coat, nylon stockings, and brown leather shoes. Because the reporter was taking pictures, she covered her face with a dark green leather handbag. Shen was wearing a navy blue melton overcoat, suit pants, and black leather shoes. After the two were escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office, they were immediately locked in a "small prison." More than twenty thieves already occupying the area were surprised to see this modern couple arrive. Then, they were taken out to fingerprint. Her red fingernails were covered with oil stains. Li was deeply affected and sobbed. Shen Gongwei remained calm and wiped the ink off his hands with a rag and handed the rag to Li to wipe herself. Fang Zheng, the prosecutor, opened the court at 3 p.m. According to Li, she once had a relationship with Shen and denied cohabitation. On the night of the 20th, Shen got her drunk with wine, saying they were going to a club, but unexpectedly sent her to Shen's home. Because she was drunk, she was not conscious, and had no choice but to let him do as he pleased, so the responsibility should be borne by Shen Gongwei. As a dancer, she has to be perfunctory to guests, and she does not intend to harm Shen's family. Shen said that he has known Li for several years, and they have been living together for a year. They are usually very affectionate, but he often quarrels with his wife because they have different personalities, so Mao took the opportunity to frame him. The court investigated and found an unlicensed No. 3 revolver and nine bullets at Shen's house. When asked why he kept the gun, Shen replied that he bought it for fun, with no other purpose. The court believed that Shen's possession of firearms was a serious matter, and ordered that he be detained. He was ordered to pay 20 million yuan in cash bail, and the court will be held on the 24th of this month for investigation.

### Floating Palace Arrives from America: A Tour of the President Cleveland; Warm and Spring-Like Decoration is Luxurious and Beautiful; Over Sixty Kinds of Dishes for One Dinner

[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] The largest and most luxurious passenger ship on the American Pacific route, the President Cleveland, arrived in Shanghai on her maiden voyage yesterday. This "floating grand hotel" attracted hundreds of Chinese and foreign women to visit and made them reluctant to leave. There are indeed reasons why it is worth lingering.

As soon as you enter the milky-white Cleveland, you immediately get the impression of "a beautiful and luxurious grand hotel," warm and spring-like. To the right is an elevator, and on both sides are staircases with gold iron railings. To the left is the information desk and the business office. Sofas line the walls. Flowers and antiques are displayed in glass cabinets on the walls. It is very beautiful. Upstairs are the dining room, cabins, lounges, etc.

### Fish, Shrimp, Oysters, and Capons from All Over the World

The ship can carry a total of 552 passengers, 330 in first class and 222 in third class. There is no second class. The enjoyment of first-class passengers can be said to be unsurpassed even by the largest hotels in China or even the Far East. The dining room has two large rooms, one called the "California" Hall and the other the "Marco Polo" Hall. Their dishes can be described as delicacies from land and sea. Just the menu is exquisite and colorful, and it is changed every meal, printed on board. Looking at yesterday's dinner menu, including cold dishes, soups, meats, vegetables, and desserts, there are more than sixty kinds in total. You can choose whatever you want, or even order everything, as long as you can eat it. Among them are Alaskan fish, Hong Kong shrimp, Californian vegetables, and eastern American oysters. You can eat as much seasonal fresh fruit as you want, all included in the fare. There is also a "Seascape Observation Room" where you can eat snacks, dance, and watch movies. These kinds of entertainment are also available in third class.

### Banquets in Neptune's Hall; Children Have Their Own Paradise

There is another room in first class called "Neptune's Hall," which is specially for passengers to host private banquets. The small room is very elegantly decorated and has a bar. There are also several lounges, living rooms, and bars. As for the interior equipment, it is all American latest-style, largest, most beautiful and generous furniture. The soft lighting is matched with elegant murals, thick velvet carpets, and large, thick, and clear glass doors. The tables are all heatproof and waterproof, and cigarette butts leave no marks on them. Although the bedrooms are smaller, they are fully equipped. The suites are particularly elegant, including a bedroom (with three beds), a bathroom, and a quiet little living room with a sea view. The mattresses are foam rubber, not spring mattresses.

The ship also has a gym and a swimming pool. There is also a "Children's Paradise," with radios, small ships, small wooden houses and various toys, and even small washrooms. Children can play there from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.

The ship has radar, radio, and safety equipment installed to the best of its ability. Especially special is that automatic fire doors are installed everywhere. If a fire breaks out, a button on the door will close immediately upon heating, isolating the fire. Otherwise, it cannot be closed. In addition, passengers can walk around everywhere on the ship's deck, forming a circle, unlike some other ships where the two sides are cut off.

### Unprecedentedly Expensive Tickets; Three Thousand Seven Hundred US Dollars

"You get what you pay for." It is conceivable that the Cleveland's tickets are expensive. The round-trip first-class ticket costs US$3,750, and the third-class round-trip is US$1,250. Starting in February (i.e., next time), it will increase by 25%. The third class fare from Shanghai to San Francisco will be US$630. Not counting the fare, the ship's expenses are also considerable. Under normal circumstances, drinking wine also requires a 25% tip.

The Cleveland was built by the California Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, costing US$21.5 million and taking three and a half years to complete. The ship is 609 feet 5 and three-quarters inches long. From the bottom deck to the highest point, there are eight decks high. The gross tonnage is 23,507 tons, and the net tonnage is 10,548 tons. Normally, it travels 19 knots per hour, and the maximum speed is 21 knots per hour. In addition to 552 passengers, there are 350 crew members, including a small number of Chinese, but they are all naturalized American citizens, because American maritime regulations require American ships to use American crew members.

Each round trip takes 39 days. Each route goes alternately clockwise and counterclockwise. This time, it departed from San Francisco, passing through Hong Kong, Yokohama, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Manila, Honolulu, and returning to San Francisco. Next time, it will depart from San Francisco, passing through Honolulu, Yokohama, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Manila, and Honolulu, returning to San Francisco.

### Mayor Wu and Others Appreciated It

Yesterday, Mayor Wu and his wife, Vice President Sun and his wife, Director Chen Guolian of the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, and foreign guests who came to visit and attend the cocktail party all praised the ship. Mayor Wu and his wife were particularly interested and were accompanied by the ship's person in charge to visit everywhere. This afternoon from 3 to 6 p.m., the ship will again invite people from all walks of life in China to board the ship for a tour.

(Also reported) Following the Cleveland, another similar sister ship of the British President Lines, the President Wilson, will set sail to China on April 15.

### Legislative Yuan Election Voting: Today is the Last Day; Competition and Promotion Gradually Calm Down

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the second day of the Legislative Yuan election. Although there was light rain in the afternoon, voter turnout was more enthusiastic than the previous day. It is estimated that the number of voters yesterday exceeded 300,000, and today, as the last day, will see even more enthusiasm. It is predicted that the total number of votes cast in this Legislative Yuan election will be around one million, similar to the National Assembly election.

Yesterday, the local Legislative Yuan election entered the final, intense stage. The need for promotion has decreased, so the promotional vehicles on the streets were not as active as on the first day. In terms of the actual voting situation, Yan Huiqing himself did very little campaigning, and his votes were scattered across all districts, each accounting for a considerable proportion. All staff members of the Shanghai Municipal Government also voted for Yan. The votes for Fang Zhichao and Wang Xinheng were also scattered across all districts, each holding a significant advantage. Ma Shuli and Ma Junshuo also received a lot of help from fellow Jiangsu northerners. Ma received quite a few votes in each district. Songshan District is the most densely populated area of the city, and Zhu Wende's votes occupied the dominant position. Among the female candidates, Zheng Yuxiu spared no effort in both public and secret campaigning. To give a concrete example, the cloth banner and purple lanterns she hung at the entrance of the International Hotel cost as much as 20 million yuan in advertising fees, and other expenses can be imagined. Because the main candidates were evenly matched, according to observations by qualified individuals, the difference in votes between the winners will be no more than 5,000 to 10,000 votes.

North District Polling Station Dispute: Thugs Handed Over to the Police Station

Yesterday, the order at each polling station in the district election was generally good.

The thugs were apprehended on the spot and handed over to the police station, and an unlicensed pistol was found on them. Upon hearing the news, Xie Renjian immediately went to see Mayor Wu, requesting that the thugs be detained and prosecuted. Also, at Hongqiao Elementary School in Xujiahui District, there was a minor dispute at around 3:00 PM yesterday, but it was not serious in nature and was resolved after mediation. At around 5:00 PM, Xie Renjian visited Zhang Xiaosong at the election office again, detailing the beating at the North Railway Station, and shared his thoughts on the Legislative Yuan election with reporters. He stated: "The police often interfere with voting, preventing the spirit of democracy from being fully implemented. In terms of campaign expenses, apart from Yan Huiqing and Zhou Yizhi, most people are wasting money. I have already spent 500 to 600 million, not to mention others."

Alternative Measures for Those Who Have Not Received Identification Cards

The election office has decided on alternative measures for voters who have not received their national identification cards. Voters can bring the receipt for their application for an identification card to the polling station to receive a ballot. After receiving the ballot, the polling station manager will stamp the original receipt to indicate that it has been used.

Technician Voting to be Extended: Most Capital Election Commissions to Act

Voting at the polling stations for the Legislative Yuan election by professional groups was even more enthusiastic than before. The ballots for the technician group were only issued from Nanjing to Shanghai yesterday morning, and the election began at 3:00 PM in the afternoon at the Central Park. Technicians from the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau, the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Public Utilities Bureau in the city all voted for Zeng Yangfu yesterday.

Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, and Zhao Kang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, will vote at the polling station today as technicians. Their voting target is also Zeng Yangfu. In addition to the technician group, all other professional group elections will officially end at noon today.

The medical and pharmaceutical group election was held at the Zhongde Hospital this time, combining the physicians, dentists, pharmacists, pharmacy assistants, and midwives associations. The venue was decorated grandly and cleanly, making it the best of all the polling stations in the city. A large-scale information desk was set up at the entrance. The voting area was newly equipped with twelve train-style single seats, each separated from the other, and each with a wall lamp and white cloth, complementing the fragrant flowers and plants, creating a quiet and solemn atmosphere. This arrangement was designed by Dr. Wang Jinrong of the Physicians Association and cost a significant amount of money. The directors of major hospitals in the city went to the venue to vote yesterday, and the number of votes for Yu Songyun, Pang Jingzhou, and Su Zengxiang (female) was relatively high.

Because the physicians association held its election separately from the medical and pharmaceutical groups this time, and there was only one candidate, the situation was relatively calm. Xi Wangshi received the most votes in the accountants association, and voting there is almost complete. When the midwives collected their election certificates yesterday, most did not have seals, so they all used fingerprints instead. One lady joked: "Hands that just delivered babies are now being used to vote!"

### Journalism Industry Asks to Investigate the Identity of National Assembly Candidate Yang Junming

Reporters' Voting Completed Smoothly

The election for the journalism industry group was held at the Lake Society yesterday. Staff from various newspapers in the city rushed to the venue to vote from 8:00 AM, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, also visited the venue yesterday. All voting was completed by 3:00 PM, and Chen Xun and Cheng Cangbo received the most votes.

The list of elected National Assembly representatives will be announced by the central government after the Legislative Yuan election is completed. More than 100 members of the city's reporters association, including Yan Fuzhou and Hu Ruchu, stated that the candidates for the National Assembly and Legislative Yuan elections from the reporters group were all well-known figures in the journalism industry, engaged in journalistic work for more than ten years and deeply supported by their peers. However, the election regulations stipulate that voters and candidates from professional groups must be basic members of their respective groups, and the membership roster must be submitted 60 days before the election. The question arises regarding National Assembly candidate Yang Junming: Which reporters association is he a member of, and what kind of news work is he currently engaged in? Since he has no contact with his colleagues, it is difficult to understand. There are fears that if he is elected, Article 39 of the Dismissal Law, which deals with qualification, might be violated, causing multiple disputes. Therefore, they jointly submitted a petition to the National Professional Women's Election Office, requesting an investigation into Yang Junming's identity as a reporter to determine whether he meets the qualifications for a candidate. They hope for an early announcement to dispel doubts. It is also said that colleagues from Jiangsu and Zhejiang gathered in Shanghai yesterday to discuss expanding this investigation.

### Corruption Scandal at Guiyang School Over Food Salt: Principal's Scheme to Purchase Inferior Goods Exposed; Staff Refuse to Resign, Preferring Collective Downfall

[Special Dispatch from Guiyang, 19th] National Guiyang Normal College is one of only three higher education institutions in Guizhou Province. Recently, a case of illegally purchasing food salt for private gain and defiling the reputation of the college authorities has come to light. After being discovered by the college's professors' association and student union, they organized a "Committee to Investigate the Food Salt Corruption Case by All Students" and sent representatives to the Guizhou Salt Bureau to review correspondence between the college and the bureau. After confirming the illicit purchase, they widely published emergency notices in Guiyang newspapers to report on the thorough investigation and reveal the truth. This action greatly angered Principal Zeng Jinghan, who asked the newspapers "not to publish" the information, leading the students to petition the Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, Gang, and the Supervising Commissioner stationed in Guiyang, He Chaozong. The situation is becoming increasingly tense. A detailed report on the incident is as follows:

The college currently has a total of no more than 1,000 teachers, staff, students, workers, and their families, including those at the affiliated middle and elementary schools.

The students' food salt has always been purchased monthly by the college sending a letter to each session's dining committee, which was responsible for purchasing the salt directly from the Guizhou Salt Bureau at the official price, without any problems. However, in the past two months, rumors suddenly spread that someone at the college was creating a roster to purchase food salt illicitly, causing difficulties for the dining committee each time they tried to purchase salt. Representatives from the professors' association and the student union secretly conducted an investigation but found no results. To solve the case as soon as possible, the college's student union joined with the education, Chinese, history and geography, English, physics and chemistry, mathematics, and physical education societies to organize a "Committee to Investigate the Food Salt Corruption Case by All Students." They conducted separate investigations inside and outside the college and sent representatives to the Guizhou Salt Bureau for inquiries. According to an emergency notice sent to various newspapers jointly signed and sealed by the student union and various societies: "Entrusted by all students, our committee went to the Guizhou Salt Bureau at 2:00 PM on the 17th of this month for inquiries. According to Mr. Jin Shiquan, a section chief in charge, the bureau received a letter from your college dated November 20, 1947, with serial number 752, stating that the college had a total of 3,158 faculty, staff, students, and their families, and requested to purchase 1,000 dan of food salt. Former Director Zhang Dexiang reviewed the request and considered the number of food salt requested to be too large, so he reduced it to 24 dan, which was personally collected by Mr. Zhu Bin, an employee sent by your college. After speaking, he also produced relevant correspondence and the application roster for verification. After detailed review and comparison by the representatives of our committee, all the details matched what Section Chief Jin Shiquan said." The truth about the illicit purchase was thus revealed. All the faculty, staff, and students of the college, as well as the Guiyang press, believe that while such bad phenomena are common and unsurprising when they involve corrupt officials or unscrupulous merchants, it is appalling that such scandalous behavior should occur in a higher education institution that cultivates teachers for secondary education. Reporters from various newspapers, after extensive investigation, have obtained clues about the entire case. Zeng Jinghan, the college principal, is from Jiangxi and is 38 years old this year. After taking office in the first half of last year, he repeatedly encountered disturbances due to not meeting public expectations. Therefore, he has been hiring fellow Jiangxi natives as much as possible to facilitate his operations. His various misdeeds have long been reported to the Ministry of Education by students, and the ministry has sent inspectors to conduct special investigations. This time, the illicit purchase of food salt was carried out by Li Ge, a member of the document section, under the alias Zhu Bin.

He personally carried a roster listing 3,158 faculty, staff, students, and their families, requesting to purchase 1,000 dan of food salt. He went to the Guizhou Salt Bureau and purchased the salt at the official price of over 40,000 yuan per dan. The Salt Bureau, seeing the college's official seal and the principal's official stamp, did not suspect anything and only thought the number was too large, reducing it to 24 dan per month, each dan being 100 jin. In November, the market price had risen to over 140,000 yuan, meaning each dan could generate over 100,000 yuan in profit. If the request to purchase 1,000 dan had been approved, the profit would have been staggering! After Li Ge obtained the food salt, he sold all of it to the Jianye Trading Company, which was opened by Principal Zeng Jing's fellow villagers. It is said that the profits were submitted by Li Ge to Zuo Zhiying, the head of the document section and a relative of the principal, for distribution. Now that the investigation is complete and the truth is revealed, Principal Zeng has taken emergency measures, recording

a major demerit against Zuo Zhiying, the head of the document section, and hinting to Li Ge to resign and leave as soon as possible. However, Li Ge insists that this was not his own doing and, now that everyone is in the water, insists on dragging everyone down together. He told people that he would not resign voluntarily and would rather go to court and face a lawsuit than take the blame alone. Since the news could not be published in Guiyang newspapers, the students changed their approach and posted advertisements, but the college sent a letter to the newspapers asking them not to publish the advertisements. They had no choice but to submit a written petition to the Provincial Assembly and the Supervising Commissioner stationed in Guiyang. It is said that they will submit all relevant documents to the court for prosecution within days and will make a full presentation when Tang Xifen, the inspector sent by the Ministry of Education, arrives in Guiyang, hoping for fair treatment. The college has been trying to find intermediaries to mediate the situation. It remains to be seen whether things will be peaceful in the future. (Special Correspondent Liu Mengchi)

### Jiangsu Provincial Assembly Members Urgently Request Reporting

The criminal court is scheduled to hear the case on the 27th.

### Nanchang Corpse: Throat Strangled, Fingerprints Visible

[Special Dispatch from Nanchang, 19th] A case of a beautiful corpse was discovered yesterday (18th) near the Dunzitang area on Huanhu Road, near the bamboo fence of Rui Garden. The identity of the deceased is that of a lonely young woman. In her childhood, she fled to Ji'an during the war. After her mother died of illness, she was taken in by Wang, who enrolled her in singing classes. In June of last year, she met a leather craftsman, Zhao Yuxiang. In July, Zhao married her for 500,000 yuan. However, Zhao was a craftsman who made a living with his hands, so his family circumstances were naturally not very wealthy. Moreover, at a time when rice was expensive, Zhao also liked to drink and gamble. Therefore, Zhao's mother was willing to sell her for double the price. The deceased, Wang Juying, learned of this and discussed it with her foster father, Wang, asking him to raise 1.2 million yuan to escape. However, due to financial difficulties, she entered the world of prostitution and worked as a prostitute in Zhu Wanyun's establishment. She met Xiao Libi, an employee of the Central Bank. However, her ex-husband, Zhao Yuxiang, after breaking off relations with the deceased, would encounter her on the street and become entangled, but he did not dare to re-enter her life. At about 9:00 PM yesterday, the deceased was still playing mahjong with her sisters in the brothel when a man wearing ragged clothes came to find her. The deceased asked where Fatty (referring to Xiao Libi) was. The man replied, "Outside." The deceased then went out with him and did not return all night. A woman of only nineteen years old was murdered in the wilderness under the fence in the quiet of the night. The fatal injury to the deceased was in her throat, with visible fingerprints, indicating strangulation. There was a one-inch scar on her lower abdomen, and her back was completely purple. Five or six steps away from the corpse, there were two spots of blood. The blood stains on the support of a new house resembled a man's bloody palm print. According to general judgment, the deceased and the murderer had a grudge. The murderer intended to stab her with a knife, but during the struggle, he strangled her to death, moved the body here, and took off the leather coat she was wearing. It was truly tragic.

### Wu County Collects More Than Half of All Grain Taxes

[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, 22nd] As of today, Wu County has collected over 282,000 dan of field tax for 1947, accounting for approximately 54% of the total tax amount. County Magistrate Wang Jiefu stated that he would continue his efforts and would be able to collect 80% by the end of the lunar year, making the future of tax administration still optimistic.

### Fierce Tigers Disrupt Security in Fujian: Senators Call for Encirclement and Suppression

[Special Dispatch from Fuzhou, 18th] In Yong'an, Datian, Youxi, and Shunchang counties of Fujian Province, tiger attacks are occurring frequently, and residents being devoured by tigers are common. According to reports, in the areas bordering Yong'an and Youxi alone, hundreds of people were taken away by tigers last year. The villagers lack sophisticated weapons and are helpless. During the Provincial Assembly session, when the police and security departments responded to inquiries, Senators Zheng Ziming, You Xingrong, and Jiang Chao loudly exclaimed, "Have the police and security departments seen that fierce tigers are disrupting security?" They added, "Where the tiger plagues exist, not only are the people's bodies unsafe, but the local forests are also damaged." They suggested, "The Army University does not have a tiger hunting course. The Fujian Provincial Police and Security Department should specially study how to train their subordinates to hunt tigers in the future." Yan Yuanyuan, the director of the department, nodded in response, saying that he could ask the local authorities to find capable individuals to organize group suppressions, and the department would provide firearms and ammunition as appropriate.

### Mount Baxian in the Wind and Rain

[Special Dispatch from Taipei, 18th] To use women as a metaphor for Taiwan's forestry, Mount Ali can be said to be a "beauty nearing twilight," while Mount Baxian is still in its "prime of youth." Mount Ali has been logged for thirty-seven years, and if the twenty-year development plan for the Nanzi Xian River is not actively implemented, it will only have two or three years left. Mount Baxian, although it also has a thirty-two-year history, can continue for about twenty-three years due to its vast area, including the left and right banks of the Datian River and the upper reaches of the Da'an River and the Beixiao River. In the future, further development of the Greater and Lesser Snow Mountains, which contain nearly 35 million stone of timber, will extend the logging for another seventy years. The surging Datian River was once planned by the Japanese for a Dajian power plant that would have been the third largest in the world; it also fertilized the rice in this basin, making it the best variety in Taiwan; now, it is nurturing a vast forest that George Naun, a forestry expert who has traveled the world for thirty years, marveled at as the best in the world. This time, he and Tang Zhenxu, Director of the Forest Products Administration, inspected the three forest areas of Mount Ali, Mount Baxian, and Mount Taiping throughout the province, and reporters heard many valuable opinions from them along the way.

Luxurious Screens in New York Hotels

Taiwan has the most precious timber in the world, but according to George Naun, it is being wasted in Taiwan. The screens in the most luxurious hotels in New York are being used here as railroad ties, piano frames, Buddha statues, and even oars for rowboats. It is found everywhere in windows and doors, and even in wooden railings. He wonders why they don't take the timber, which costs four U.S. dollars per foot, to his country—Australia—where they can exchange a small number of conifers for a large number of hardwood railroad ties. Based on this, he feels that the irrational use of timber in Taiwan is equivalent to not logging at all, and he believes that the provincial government's ban on timber exports is a major mistake. He hopes for a five-year plan, a "Forestry Law" specifically for Taiwan's forestry. With five years of dedicated management, the income can be increased more than tenfold, with six-tenths of the logging revenue being reinvested in reforestation. Relying on annual budget appropriations for reforestation will never succeed. The Forest Management Bureau's budget for reforestation this year was 2.4 billion yuan, but only 800 million yuan was approved. He is very confident that with just two words—Good Selling—

Cable Cars and Straight Ascension to the Peak

Mount Baxian has two noteworthy constructions: one is an inclined railway (Incline) that is over 1,800 meters long, the longest inclined railway in the Far East. It is divided into three sections, each ascending over 1,100 meters at an angle of about 30 degrees. It uses electric-powered cables to transport timber and has been in use for twenty-four years. Everything is dilapidated. Because there are many curves, timber transport is more difficult, averaging only 85 cubic meters per day. In today's terms, this is already an outdated tool. The second is the cableway. We departed from Jiabaohe Station, eight people packed into a box, and ascended via the cables, using the weight of the timber lowered from the mountain to climb straight to the peak. The feeling was ethereal, but looking down, we were more than 1,000 meters above the ground. If the cable were to break, the consequences would be unimaginable. The cable had been used for thirteen years and had many visible splices. Each logging area is requesting equipment replenishment. In the face of violent winds and rain, we traveled from the terminus of the cableway, New Mount Baxian, and then took a charcoal-powered vehicle, risking great danger, to see the timber collection machine. The workers in the logging area, who live permanently on this mountain over 2,000 feet high, wore tattered short shirts and trousers, but they still worked hard. These people are in the wind and rain, and the equipment is also in the wind and rain. Isn't the entire forestry industry of Taiwan also in the wind and rain?

Steep Slopes with a 1:1 Ratio

Professor Kao reports that he is willing to offer Taiwan's forestry as one of the joint undertakings of the United Nations. He conducted a detailed survey of the equipment shortages and also noted the number of sawmills throughout the province. He specifically pointed out that Taiwan can build as many timber processing plants as possible in the future, including plywood, tool handles, high-end furniture, and steam-treated wood products, all of which can be supplied to the world market, increasing the economy of Taiwan and even China as a whole. After boarding Mount Ali and Mount Baxian, he suggested that Hubei, Fujian, and the western powers should send people here to study and train the future backbone of China's forestry development. When I asked him why he specifically mentioned Hubei and Fujian provinces, he smiled and said that companies have been organized here before and have requested a lot of equipment, but they did not understand the development technology. Studying in Taiwan has two advantages: first, the projects are complete, covering the entire process from logging, timber collection, and transportation; second, the slopes are steep. In Australia, most slopes have an incline with a ratio of 1:4, while Taiwan has a ratio of 1:1. Being able to overcome this difficulty means being able to overcome any difficulty. He repeatedly praised the workers' skilled techniques. Director Tang said that Professor Kao's views have their unique insights, and these opinions may be shared with everyone who cares about Taiwan's forestry. (Reporter Yang Wenyu)

### Refugee Youths in Huaiyin Concentrated in Vocational Training Classes

[Report from our Zhenjiang Office, 21st] In order to align with the national policy of mobilizing for the suppression of rebellion, the "Youth Guidance" program closely follows the tide of national reconstruction and rushes towards the pacified areas, launching a rescue effort to save youths. Although thousands upon thousands of youths from northern Jiangsu have crossed the Yangtze River in batches, each finding a place to settle and warmth, there are still many youths trapped in the deep mire of the bandit areas, longing for relief and guidance. Huaiyin is an important town in northern Jiangsu, controlling the intersection of the Huai River and the Grand Canal, serving as a crucial passage between Jiangsu and Anhui, and as a hub connecting the north and south of the Yangtze River. Youths from Huaiyin, Huaian, Lianshui, Siyang, Chenfu, Ningshu, Shuyang, and Guanyun mostly gather and disperse here. How can we ignore the youths there? Therefore, the Jiangsu Youth Guidance Office of the Ministry of Education, facing the current reality and responding to local requests, decided to set up a guidance institution in April of last year, the Huaiyin Vocational Training Class, to take in the escaped youths from the Huaiyin area, provide them with material relief, give them vocational training, and revive their mental fatigue. This is the origin of the Huaiyin Vocational Training Class and its historical roots. Although the Huaiyin Vocational Training Class has only been growing for a short eight or nine months, it has already conducted two registrations, taking in nearly a thousand youths. The first term enrolled 482 youths, who have now all found employment. Some serve in education, shouldering cultural responsibilities; some work as administrative cadres, promoting local autonomy; and some handle cooperation, sharing the responsibility of economic construction. Such individualized guidance has fulfilled part of the responsibility to society, the country, and the youths, making some contributions. However, those in charge believe that it is still far from ideal and are not complacent. Therefore, how to work hard and make further plans in the future is the most important issue for them. The second registration of youths has just been completed, and the training plan is being implemented according to the scheduled procedures. This time, the number of people admitted is more than 300. From the conversations with the admitted youths, we know that their previously wandering and disappointed minds and bodies have received infinite comfort!

In short, the Huaiyin Vocational Training Class is growing. Although there are various difficulties that prevent their rescue and guidance work from being fully developed as ideally as possible, those working there have indeed made the greatest efforts. We can see the results before our eyes, and we can see the direction they are constantly moving in. (Our reporter He Xianglin)

### Old Woman's Sixth Pregnancy Results in Monkey-Like Monster Baby

[Dispatch from our Hainan Island Office, 16th] At 2:00 PM on the 14th, at the Li Qifang Clinic on Zhangxing Street, Haikou City, Chen Zhou, a woman from Shuitou Village, Xiuying Township, gave birth to a strange stillborn baby resembling a monkey. It had a large head and small jaw, lacking a nose and upper lip. Its throat was directly connected to the top of its head. The hair on its head was black and long like down, and it had no cranial bone. The right ear was large, and the left ear was small. Its hands and feet were no different from a normal infant, and its body was quite strong. According to Dr. Li, the fetus moved frequently in the mother's womb but remained silent. This small life breathed its last at 8:00 PM. The mother is now safe and sound. The clinic believes that this fetus has research value and is now preserved in a glass bottle with formalin solution. Upon hearing the news, citizens flocked to see it from morning till night and discussed it, saying that the woman was already 53 years old, exceeding the age of fertility. Generally, women over 49 years old experience menopause and stop childbearing, but this woman, at the advanced age of 53, gave birth to a strange infant, which is truly a strange occurrence. According to the reporter's investigation, the woman had previously given birth to six children, both male and female, who died shortly after birth, either after three or four months or two or three years. None of them lived to adulthood. This fetus was her sixth pregnancy, and she had been pregnant for eleven full months. During the abnormal pregnancy, she lived a normal life. At around 11:00 AM on the 14th, her husband accompanied her to the clinic for delivery. The doctor found that the fetus's buttocks were presenting first, which was not a normal delivery. He asked her husband to sign the consent form and then performed a surgery to extract the fetus.

### The First Lesson of Southern Democracy: A Large-Scale Election Education Movement Unfolds

[Report from our Zhoupu Office, 22nd] On the 21st, the people of Nanhui began to receive the first lesson in democracy. Because of the promotion by the Nanhui County Election Education Movement Promotion Association, the people were slowly starting to feel interested in this matter, or at least it had caught their attention. Those who had not received their voting cards knew to urge the Baojia heads to get them, and those who had already received their voting cards were preparing to show their skills and try out this power that they had never truly used before.

Of course, this is, after all, the first lesson, and not everything can go as we wish. At the same time, due to the different levels of effort of those in charge, there are bound to be different results among the various villages and Baos. The reporter is willing to briefly report on the situation witnessed on the first day:

Polling Stations: One Per Bao. To meet the needs of universal voting, the Nanhui County Election Office presented a request to the provincial government to set up more polling stations. The standard is one per Bao, for a total of 499 in the county. Zhoupu Town has 21 Baos, so there are also 21 polling stations. At 9:00 AM, the administrators and supervisors of each polling station arrived one after another, and voting began. Voters also poured in like a flowing stream, and the results were very satisfactory. Throughout Nanhui County, only a few Baos, either because the Bao head was negligent and the procedures had not been completed, or because the Bao head was tied up with private matters and could not start the election as scheduled, but these were very few phenomena. The general situation was very good.

Wang Genzhong Campaigns for Di Ying. Wang Genzhong is a candidate for election to Di Ying, supported by all sectors of Nanhui, and is also the initiator of this election education movement. This time, he almost ignored the issue of his own votes and election, and single-mindedly used all his strength to promote the election education movement. At 9:00 AM on the 21st, he personally went to the fifth Bao of Zhoupu Town to vote as a voter, and he voted for Di Ying.

As for the other voters, voting was absolutely free, and the targets of the election were also quite widespread. However, according to general estimates, Wang Genzhong received an absolute majority of the votes.

Propaganda Vehicles Set Off on Patrol

After the voting began, the election education propaganda work was carried out even more actively. The propaganda train of the Election Education Promotion Association set off yesterday to the distant northern areas of Beicai, Zhangjiang, and Guhe. The costumed propaganda team of the Shupu group went to Duxing and Luohui yesterday and continued to Xuanqiao Township today. In addition, the propaganda team of Dajiang Middle School also went to the Zhoupu area. No matter which team or which team member, they all participated in the work with great enthusiasm. Because they know that they are not campaigning for any one person; they are promoting democratic education, which is the most practical and timely social education.

As of the evening of the 21st, the voting rate in various places averaged over 60%. Among them, the first, ninth, and tenth Baos of Luhui Township and the first Bao of Liuzao Township completed all voting. The eighth Bao of Xinchang Town and the tenth Bao of Tanzhi Township also reached 98%. With two more days of effort, the results will be considerable. Therefore, several gentlemen from the Election Education Movement Promotion Association breathed a sigh of relief and said, "This election education movement can be considered a success, and our efforts have finally paid off!"

### Tongji University Student Strike at a Standstill

President Ding Hopes Students Will Return to Class Tomorrow; Rumors That Zhu Jiahua Will Return to Shanghai from Taiwan to Mediate

[Report from our office] Tongji University students have been on strike for a week to protest the school's arbitrary expulsion of classmates. The opinions of both sides are deadlocked and becoming increasingly sharp. The expelled students have no relatives in Shanghai and are all living on campus, maintaining close contact with the students still in school. In order to concentrate their forces and discuss how to deal with the school's actions, the students of the liberal arts and medical colleges moved into the engineering college on Qimei Road yesterday for food and lodging. The students of the freshman college and the law college are also scheduled to move into the engineering college in the next two days to show their determination to persevere to the end. Since President Ding Wenyuan, all department heads have not been working on campus these days. Although the professors of each college department want to go to school to teach, the classrooms are quiet and empty. Some of those willing to teach are also emotionally unsettled and have left one after another. According to President Ding in a telephone call last night, he hopes that the students will all return to class tomorrow, otherwise, the fourth list of expelled students will be announced immediately. He also scheduled an administrative meeting for 3:00 PM today to discuss the matter. Ding did not deny that the school's strike problem would be difficult to resolve satisfactorily in the short term, because he believes that in implementing the national education policy and maintaining the dignity of school administration, he will never compromise on the students' insistence on illegal demands. Yesterday, the reporter visited several professors at the school. They all refused to express their opinions, saying that "it is difficult to speak," and were unwilling to come forward to mediate, only hoping that Tongji alumni would come forward to mediate, which would be more appropriate.

[Another dispatch] It was widely rumored at the school yesterday that many influential Tongji alumni, such as Tang Zhe, were mediating and had telegraphed Minister Zhu Jiahua to fly from Taiwan to Shanghai to participate in the mediation as a Tongji alumnus. Also, the Tongji Veterans Youth Friendship Association sent several representatives yesterday to meet with President Ding in a third-party capacity, requesting a disguised recognition of the newly elected student union in order to break the long-term stalemate and facilitate an early return to class. President Ding did not grant their request and urged the students to return to class, after which they could prepare for the student union in accordance with the new student union charter promulgated by the Ministry.

### Jiaotong University President Advocates Work-Study Program

### Professors from the Social Education College Went to Beijing Yesterday to Petition

Requesting Treatment to be Reclassified as Third Zone [Report from our Suzhou office] All professors of the National Social Education College believe that Suzhou is close to Shanghai, and the general price level is not lower than Shanghai but higher than Nanjing. In the past, the treatment of public education personnel was one level lower than that of Beijing and Shanghai, but national schools still had a special subsidy allowance. The recent salary adjustment method canceled the special subsidy allowance, and Suzhou was classified as the fourth zone. This time, schools in Beijing and Shanghai increased by 120%, while Suzhou only increased by 50% and had no in-kind rations. They expressed extreme dissatisfaction with this. On the 22nd, four professors were specially sent as representatives to Beijing to appeal to the central government, requesting that the treatment of public education personnel in Suzhou be reclassified as the third zone.

### Tuition Fees for Private Schools Next Semester Will Not Be Restricted As a Principle

Li Ximou Told Reporters Yesterday

[Report from our office] Li Ximou, acting director of the Municipal Education Bureau, told reporters yesterday that the tuition fees for private primary and secondary schools next semester will not be restricted as a principle. However, if the bureau believes that the number stipulated by each school is unreasonable, it will convene a council to submit it for discussion. Director Li also hopes that each school will increase the number of free places as much as possible to accommodate poor students and avoid dropping out of school. Regarding the matter of the teachers and staff of municipal middle schools borrowing one month's salary for February, Director Li agreed to lend it as well, since municipal primary school teachers and staff should be treated equally.

[Report from our office] Jiang Jiju, chairman of the Joint Association of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in this city, visited Li, the acting director of the Education Bureau, yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of private school teachers and staff requesting in-kind rations. According to Jiang, Director Li expressed great sympathy for this request, but because the decision-making power rests with the central government, he will express his views to the central government immediately. If it is approved, according to the current price calculation, the school's expenditure on teachers' and staff's treatment can be reduced by one-third, and tuition fees can also be reduced by one-third as a result.

Regarding the issue of private school fees for the next semester, Jiang said that it is still early before the start of school, and a regular discussion has not yet been scheduled.

### Municipal Education Bureau Orders All Schools to Issue Purchase Certificates to Prevent Fraudulent Claims

[Report from our office] The purchase certificates for the month of December of the 36th year for the Municipal Qizhong National School in this city were forged with official seals and fraudulently claimed in their entirety. The Public Education Personnel Material Supply Review Committee has telegraphed each supply agency and ordered the relevant sales stores to pay attention. If discovered, they should be detained. It also telegraphed the Police Bureau to investigate in order to solve the case as soon as possible. Now, in order to prevent fraudulent claims and protect the interests of the recipient schools, the Education Bureau has ordered all national schools, public schools, and private primary schools running national education classes to submit a 2.5-inch half-length photo of the person responsible for claiming the purchase certificates along with a formal official letter to the Review Committee in advance for verification in order to prevent fraud.

### Interest on Private School Tuition and Miscellaneous Fees Will Be Used to Fund Teacher Training

### Trisecting Any Angle is Still a Difficult Problem

Based on Euclid's Geometric Construction Postulates

Our readers Xiao Chengji and Kong Fanqing sent letters criticizing a reader in Xi'an for saying that "trisecting any angle is not a difficult problem," believing that it was not correct. The contents of the letters are recorded as follows:

"I saw in your newspaper on the 13th that a reader from Xi'an stated a method for trisecting an arbitrary angle with a straightedge, saying: 'Pass the straightedge through point B, move it within this angle to make the BE line, intersecting the DG line at F and the DP line at E, such that EF is twice the length of BD.' This method actually violates Euclid's geometric construction postulates, because the so-called elementary geometry construction, in addition to limiting the use of compasses and straightedges, the Euclid's Elements also has regulations on the use of these two tools: A straight line can be drawn through two points. A circle can be drawn with a fixed point as the center and a fixed length as the radius. The reason why trisecting an angle is impossible is due to this kind of restriction. Now, the application of the straightedge in the above method has exceeded Euclid's postulates, so it cannot be regarded as a legitimate method. As for this problem, I completely agree with the opinion of Dr. Zhang Dexin, Dean of Academic Affairs of Changda, and its theoretical basis has long been recognized by the mathematical community. Shen Bao reader Xiao Chengji"

"I recently read in your newspaper on the 13th that a reader from Xi'an submitted a letter stating: 'Trisecting any angle is not a difficult problem,' and also gave a method of division using only a straightedge, but he neglected the conditions limited by Euclidean geometry—a compass and a non-graduated straightedge (even triangles cannot be used). Under the restrictions of Euclidean geometric construction, drawing a parallel line (or perpendicular line) requires the use of a compass, but how did this reader, who learned the method of using only a straightedge at Beiyang University, make the perpendicular line DG and the parallel line DE? But this BE line can never be made with a compass and a straightedge, so this method cannot be regarded as a solution. The Yang method that was rumored for a while is still an approximate method, but it is not the purpose of Euclidean geometry. However, Mr. Yang still knew to state in advance that he 'had not studied higher mathematics,' that is, Mr. Yang still knew that his learning was insufficient (Mr. Yang's method does not require higher mathematics to prove its error, we will not discuss this in detail for the time being). And this reader quoted what 'Professor ××× of Beiyang University said…' as proof, which is a bit laughable. This is my humble opinion, and I hope it will be published to set things straight. Shen Bao reader Kong Fanqing."

[Central News Agency, Guanghan News] Yuan Chenglin, an engineer from the 30th Engineering Section of the 8th General Engineering Section of the 5th District Highway Engineering Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications Highway Administration, saw in the newspaper that Dr. Zhang Dexin, Dean of Academic Affairs of Changda, expressed doubt about Yang Jiaru's invention of "trisecting any angle," believing that it was impossible. He said that the problem of "making a circle equal to a square" or "making a square equal to a circle" had been raised at the Nobel Prize Society, indicating that it was necessarily solvable, but no one had yet obtained the correct answer. Mr. Yuan was deeply interested and, after research, obtained a solution to the three questions of "trisecting any angle," "making a circle equal to a square," and "making a square equal to a circle." The method is simple and the proof is correct. Mr. Yuan has now sent letters to teaching experts across the country for discussion and has listed the solution method for research by people across the country. Anyone can make a drawing according to his method. Letters can be sent to 97 Nanjing Road, Guanghan, Yun. [Announcement] Recently, our newspaper readers have sent letters to discuss the issue of "trisecting any angle." We are deeply grateful, but due to space limitations, we cannot disclose them one by one. We hope for your forgiveness. Editor

### China Trust Bureau Hong Kong Branch Sets Up Measures to Advance Funds for Purchasing Industrial Raw Materials

To Assist Domestic Manufacturers in Increasing Production.

The Hong Kong Branch of the Central Trust Bureau has established measures to advance funds for purchasing industrial raw materials in order to encourage domestic industry, increase production, support manufacturers, and promote people's livelihood. Any domestic manufacturer who has been granted an import quota for industrial raw materials by the Export-Import Management Committee may entrust the Central Trust Bureau to advance funds for purchasing and transporting the quota of raw materials. Domestic manufacturers who intend to entrust the Hong Kong Branch of the Central Trust Bureau to advance funds for purchasing raw materials should request a price quote from the local Central Trust Bureau or directly from the Hong Kong Branch of the Central Trust Bureau, and should request that the Central Trust Bureau be listed as the consignor and recipient in the import permit. In order to meet the deadline of the import permit, the Hong Kong Branch of the Central Trust Bureau will only accept the entrusted purchase of raw materials that can be purchased in Hong Kong for the time being. The measures for purchasing from Europe and the United States will be discussed separately. If a manufacturer can provide evidence of having the seasonal quota and pay a 30% deposit, the Bureau may pre-order the materials. If an import permit has already been obtained and the permit is handed over to the Bureau to handle the import procedures, no deposit is required, but a guarantor approved by the Central Trust Bureau must be obtained before the entrustment can be accepted. The Hong Kong Branch of the Central Trust Bureau will advance all expenses for the price of the raw materials, warehouse rent, insurance, and freight, and will transport the materials to China for import and hand them over to the local Central Trust Bureau warehouse for safekeeping, notifying the manufacturer to pick up the goods. After the entrusted raw materials are imported, foreign exchange settlement procedures will be carried out. When the foreign exchange is obtained, the Hong Kong Branch of the Central Trust Bureau must be reimbursed for the advance funds, interest, and handling fees. The deadline for the advance funds for the entrusted purchase of raw materials shall not exceed the date stipulated in the import permit. The interest rate on the advance funds shall be calculated at a weekly rate of 7%, plus a handling fee of 0.1%. After the entrusted manufacturer is notified by the local Central Trust Bureau that the raw materials have been imported, it must settle the foreign exchange and pick up the goods within 14 days. If the deadline is exceeded, the local Central Trust Bureau will handle the foreign exchange settlement and dispose of the goods freely, unless otherwise agreed with the local Central Trust Bureau in advance.

In the afternoon, due to tight funds in the industry, there was a shift from buying to selling, so the price of ten boxes of Great Britain Old Knife cigarettes fell again by 250,000 to 150,000 yuan. In addition, only Red Man and Three Cats brands were more actively cleared, uniquely priced at 1,000 to 2,000 yuan better. The prices of other Chinese and foreign cigarettes and canned cigarettes remained down.

The daily necessities soap market was quiet, and firm-based soap fell to 1.7 million yuan, reportedly sold, down 35,000 yuan from the previous day. In the afternoon, due to credit constraints, there were more sellers, and the prices of Arrow, Knife, Xiangmao, and Guanghua soaps all fell by more than 10,000 to 30,000 yuan. Beautiful Phoenix brand of matches fell by 150,000 yuan, miscellaneous brands rebounded by 40,000 to 50,000, kerosene trading was not active, the market was weak, and the price fell slightly by 20,000. The price of each can of Mobil was 780,000 yuan.

### No Interest from New Buyers: Chinese Stocks Sink into Slump

Chinese stocks were uncertain yesterday. The buying momentum in the middle of the day was temporary. Although there was still desire, there was no interest from new buyers. The rising momentum faded quickly, and the market ended in a slump.

Yongsha opened in the morning at 690 yuan and 735 yuan, falling to low prices of 678 yuan and 717 yuan. Outside the market, the interest rate was slightly lower, at 30% and 34.5%. It rose to 694 yuan and 732 yuan. Although there was profit-taking at high prices, large traders still had the intention to buy, and near noon it rose to high prices of 704 yuan and 742 yuan. The noon closing price was 699 yuan and 734 yuan. Compared to the previous closing price, the immediate-delivery stocks Huaxin fell 10%, Huafeng, Zhongni, Wuhe, and Zhongfa fell 5%, Zhabei Rongyan, Datong, Yonggong, and Innerwear were flat, and the rest rose and fell slightly. The deferred-delivery stocks Meiya rose 5%, and the rest rose slightly.

In the afternoon, the start of the market was strong, but it was only temporary. From 707 yuan and 735 yuan, it fell straight to low prices of 673 yuan and 700 yuan. The National Bank of China exchanged the difference, and market confidence was boosted. It rebounded twice to over 690 yuan and 720 yuan. After struggling, it closed at prices of 685 yuan and 718 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning closing price, the immediate-delivery stocks Meiya, Huafeng, and Yonggong fell 5%, and the rest of the stocks rose and fell slightly. The deferred-delivery stocks Huafeng, Jingfu, Meiya, and Qinxing fell 5%, and the rest fell slightly. The performances of various unlisted stocks in the over-the-counter market varied.

The current arbitrage trading was very stable yesterday. Yongsha opened at a discount of 37 yuan, retreated from 39 yuan to 36 yuan, and closed at 37.5 yuan. Xinhe fell from 20 yuan to 17 yuan and closed at 18 yuan. Meiya rose from 55 yuan to 60 yuan at closing. Xinguang was around 5 yuan, and those who invested at a discount could earn an interest of 20 to 25 cents.

### Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks Stable

The government bond market was stable yesterday. Tong Bing opened at 77,000, with a low price of 67,000, and then rebounded to 73,000. The total turnover was about 4 million. Compared to the previous closing price, Jia and Yi were flat, and Bing, Ding, and Wu each rose by 1,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks also rebounded in the middle of yesterday's session, but it was difficult to sustain, and the market remained flat. There were goods from the Guangdong traders. The foreign firms and securities firms sold after buying. Yisha opened at 540,000, rebounded from 530,000 to over 560,000, and then flattened out. There was even less progress in the afternoon. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, Yisha and British Union rose slightly, Jardine Matheson, Jardine Brewery, and Ken Zhi were flat, Paper Edition and Navigation each fell 5%, and the rest fell slightly.

### Export-Import Management Committee Approves Advance Import of Goatskin Packaging Materials

After the export packaging materials import measures were approved by the Executive Yuan, the Export-Import Management Committee immediately followed up with registration. The registration in this city has been completed, and various districts outside the city have also been reporting one after another. As of now, the committee has received 331 applications, including 197 from this city, 24 from Qingdao, 104 from Tianjin, 3 from Chongqing, and 3 from Hankou. Only the offices in Taiwan, Guangzhou, and Shenyang have not yet submitted their reports. The committee's Export Promotion Division has begun to review those that are needed seasonally. In practical terms, packaging materials such as tinplate and camphor for goatskin are the most urgent. Therefore, the review has begun. For every million goatskins, 30 tons of camphor and 15 tons of tinplate are needed. Camphor costs 80 to 85 pounds per ton internationally, and tinplate costs 6 yuan in gold per 100 pounds. The committee has sent a letter to the Central Bank to prepare to allocate this foreign exchange quota. According to export industry authorities: 6 million goatskins can be exported this year, with an average price of 1 US dollar per skin, which can be exchanged for 6 million US dollars in foreign exchange. However, due to poor transportation, it may be difficult to achieve this goal.

### National Bank of China Adjusts Operations and Implements Regional Bank System

Wang Zhong is appointed as the director of the Northeast Regional Bank. In order to adjust its operations, the National Bank of China abolished 14 sub-branches last year and established new branches in Yan'an, Yantai, and other places. In addition to the Yan'an branch, which has already opened, the Yantai branch is also actively preparing to open. The establishment of the Northeast Regional Bank has been prepared, and recently Wang Zhong, the special commissioner for the Northeast region, has been reassigned as the director of the Northeast Regional Bank, marking the beginning of the bank's pilot regional bank system.

Chinese Medicine Declines: The market for Chinese medicine has once again entered a state of difficulty. The foreign and Guangdong traders' pepper and black Sichuan increased to a peak price of 260,000, but because the Shandong traders stopped operating and sales in other places were stagnant, coupled with the extremely tight credit situation among traders and the continuous arrival of goods, prices have been falling frequently. Yesterday the price fell to 160,000, but there were still few takers. The price difference per catty was 100,000 yuan in one week. However, Da He Xiang's firm reputation is stable. Sichuan Han, Xi Huai, Guan Bei, and other goods are still considered firm.

Buddha's Hand Slices: There are few arrivals and smooth sales. The market price is 140,000 yuan, but there is no stock. The Hong Kong market quotation, plus foreign fees, shows that the cost of new arrivals is more than 217,000 yuan.

Longkou Noodles Loosen: Longkou thread noodles and dried noodles, which had risen too sharply before, have also fallen with the general decline in prices, falling by 10% to 20% from before. Yesterday, the market price for good genuine goods was 9 million yuan, and 8.5 million yuan for the next best.

### The Financial Management Bureau Will Not Loosen Its Freeze on Speculative Bank Notes

Regarding the freezing of bank notes, the City Bank Association submitted a document to the Financial Management Bureau yesterday requesting the unfreezing. The reason is that since the bank has not been declared for liquidation, the bank notes should not be frozen. However, according to a person in charge of the Financial Management Bureau: According to Article 9 of the authorities' measures for controlling financial operations, if it is found that there is any situation that promotes speculation and hoarding, emergency measures may be taken to advise the bank to suspend operations and liquidate, and to transfer its managers to the court for punishment. Moreover, according to the Ministry of Finance's telegram No. 29983 of July 17, 1947 (Financial Money Gen), the practice of allowing bills to be used as cash before they are collected is not only sufficient to expand credit, but also makes it difficult for the banks themselves to manage their funds, creating major drawbacks and posing a considerable risk, and has been corrected by the Ministry of Finance in the past. After investigation, this kind of situation is still prevalent. In order to implement government decrees, the bureau will strictly deal with any speculative behavior and any suspected gold and silver business violations found during inspections. In addition to handling them according to law, all bills and checks will be frozen first, and no leniency will be granted.

### Last November's Import and Export Trade: Trade Deficit Improved, Increased Exports and Decreased Imports Were Rare Occurrences in the Past

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to the import and export trade statistics for China in November of last year released by the Inspectorate General of Customs, the trade deficit improved compared to previous months. Exports sharply increased, nearly tripling compared to October, while imports also decreased compared to October. This was a rare occurrence before November of last year. The relevant figures are detailed below:

The net value of imports in November was 1,678,770,397,000 yuan, and the net value of exports was 1,560,524,082,000 yuan, resulting in a total trade deficit of 118,246,315,000 yuan. Compared to October, the net value of imports in October was 1,746,766,278,000 yuan, meaning the net value of imports in November decreased by 67,995,881,000 yuan. The net value of exports in October was 530,040,429,000 yuan, meaning the net value of exports in November sharply increased by 1,030,483,653,000 yuan.

Among the sharply increased exports, textiles (疋頭) accounted for the largest share, totaling 409.1 billion yuan. Other significant exports included pig bristles and animal products, totaling 261.9 billion yuan; tung oil and wax, 218.5 billion yuan; metals and mineral ores, 141.9 billion yuan; soybeans, peanuts, etc., 163.8 billion yuan; grains, 24.7 billion yuan; and tea, 48.6 billion yuan.

In November, the main export destination for China was still the United States, importing 480 billion yuan worth of goods. Hong Kong followed with 335 billion yuan, and India with 99.7 billion yuan. The main import source for China was also the United States, exporting 786.4 billion yuan worth of goods to China. India followed with 229 billion yuan, and the United Kingdom with 123.4 billion yuan.

### Central Trust Bureau Plans to Resume Bartering Salt for Japanese Goods

After the Central Trust Bureau stopped bartering salt for Japanese goods last year, the bartering trade with Japan has not been able to resume. The goods Japan shipped to China for bartering have all been done on account, and China has not yet determined what other goods to use to offset the value of the Japanese goods. However, China does have a surplus in salt production, which China itself cannot fully utilize. Therefore, the Bureau is currently consulting with the Salt Administration and other relevant agencies, planning to resume bartering salt for Japanese goods in the near future. This will serve to exchange for raw materials needed by China and to repay the debts from last year.

### Industry Insiders Analyze Difficulties in Chinese Tea Exports

Regarding the recent situation of Chinese tea exports, its inherent difficulties, and future prospects, here is an analysis from qualified individuals in the tea industry, outlining the general situation: The international market still primarily targets the United States. To encourage exports, after the implementation of the new foreign exchange measures, the government adjusted prices dynamically based on actual conditions. While this provided some benefits to exporters, buyers in the United States felt that the foreign exchange rate was unstable and, to avoid losses, dared not purchase in large quantities, instead opting for small transactions: selling a certain amount and then replenishing that amount, resulting in stagnant wholesale sales. Trade with France is not conducted in US dollars; it must first be converted from francs to gold pounds or US dollars. Import and export controls are as strict as those in China, and not all of its exports can be approved for import into China. Furthermore, among the goods that France might import, not all are Chinese tea, resulting in reduced fragmented sales. For large-scale transactions of green tea, a new avenue has been opened. Last year's shipments were managed by the French Yongxing Trading Company in Shanghai, entrusted by the French delegation. There were several shipments to France last year, with the last batch consisting of about 30,000 cases, each weighing about 60 catties, totaling about 18,000 dan. The price per dan was 2.4 million to 2.8 million yuan for Chunmee green tea, and 1.7 million to 1.8 million yuan for Ping green tea, with Yongxing accounting for the majority. Other companies, such as China Tea Company, Wang Yutai, and Wuchang, also entrusted Yongxing to transport their goods. Before the war, British black tea sold very well. After the war, a nationwide culture of frugality in Britain led to a reluctance to taste high-quality Chinese tea, preferring to lower standards and opt for inferior teas. Sales of Soviet tea bricks were also strong in the past, but due to unresolved bartering procedures, it is temporarily impossible to promote sales, although it remains an ideal market in the future.

Regarding the internal difficulties of tea and its future prospects, the individuals believe that tea is generally calculated based on rice, with each three dan of rice equated to one dan of tea. The cost of tea itself accounts for one and a half dan of rice, with the rest covering processing, transportation, and packaging costs. Recalling that the price of tea was 300,000 yuan per dan in the previous year, a fund of 1 billion yuan could purchase over 3,000 dan of tea. Last year, the price of tea rose to 1.5 million yuan per dan, so the original fund could only purchase about 660 dan of tea. According to the current price of rice, only about 200 dan can be purchased. If there is a shortage of grain and the price of rice fluctuates again, the amount will be even smaller. Due to this reason, tea merchants are intimidated by the large amount of capital required, and their profits are minimal. The future of tea is shrouded in a gloomy atmosphere, which is the source of the crisis. To improve this situation, the government must be called upon to assist. The first principle is to entrust tea merchants with "processing on behalf," granting them legitimate profits to improve quality, reduce costs, promote exports, and earn foreign exchange. The second is "procurement," with the government quickly providing large loans for tea merchants to produce finished products, which are then purchased at actual cost, with the government subsidizing the difference to encourage exports.

### Promoting Exports of Silk Fabrics

China Sericulture Trust and Xinguang Weaving produce Silk Shirts

To promote the export of silk fabrics, the China Sericulture Company has had its silk woven into silk fabric suitable for export underwear. It is cooperating with Xinguang Underwear Company to have the silk fabric made into shirts and underwear for sale in Europe, the Americas, and Southeast Asia. It is reported that shirts of the same quality from abroad cost about 1.4 million yuan each when imported into China. The shirts made from this silk fabric cost only 700,000 yuan each. More than a dozen styles of sample shirts in various colors have been produced. They are colorful, inexpensive, and of high quality, making the prospects for export optimistic. At the same time, they also meet the needs of domestic people, reducing the import of foreign goods, easing the burden on consumers, and reducing the outflow of foreign exchange.

[Another Report] According to statistics from the China Sericulture Company, last year's silk exports to the United States accounted for 2,150 bales, India 1,240 bales, Burma 1,600 bales, the United Kingdom 1,165 bales, Annam 40 bales, France 73 bales, and the Soviet Union 600 bales. The shipments currently being prepared include 800 bales to the United States and 1,300 bales to Burma. The method of shipment is consignment to the United States, bartering to the Soviet Union, and direct trade with signed contracts to the rest. The export price is 3 yuan per pound. The price for US consignment is determined by market prices, but the US market price has now fallen to 2.6 yuan, affecting all countries. Value-added silk fabrics, such as those woven into pajamas and evening gowns, can be worth 4 to 5 yuan per pound, which is more profitable than raw silk. According to the Silk Weaving Industry Association, last year from May to the end of the year, India alone sold 99,000 pieces of our silk fabrics. Although affected by the internal turmoil in India, sales are still not a problem. The silk fabrics shipped to India last year can be exchanged for 5 million US dollars in foreign exchange. If the government can provide maximum assistance to exports, India alone can generate 10 million US dollars in foreign exchange each year.

### Executive Yuan Approves Restrictions on Imported Foreign Yarn Tubes

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] To protect China's nascent industries, the import of foreign yarn tubes has been approved by the Executive Yuan for restriction. The import of Japanese yarn tubes will be prohibited after the opening of trade with Japan. This matter was at the request of the Yarn Tube Industry Association, and the National Economic Council sent a letter to the Transport Control Committee to restrict imports and requested the Ministry of Economic Affairs to instruct the Central Industrial Experiment Institute to urge the improvement of domestically produced yarn tubes.

New Medicine and New Drugs

### The Medical Artisan

— Yao Xingshu

If our memories serve us correctly, we should still remember the "Fake Phoenix, False Emperor" dispute—one of Shanghai's top ten news stories in 1936—, "What a mess!", compatriots flared up and geared up over a feud over a "artisan". Even though I am ignorant, I'm not belittling this to the extent of ignoring common sense, and daring to use words that are not well-balanced, am I not afraid of making a fool of myself? But wait—

Originally, these two words "medical artisan" were not something I blurted out; in the Urgent Chapters written by Han Dynasty historian You, there is a sentence: "Support the declining and welcome the medical artisan". The ancient people used the words "medical artisan" before me. If there is a crime in using words improperly, then the crime lies with Shi You.

"Artisan" is a general term for all laborers, so coppersmiths, blacksmiths, carpenters, plasterers, ... (excuse my bluntness) and so on, are endless. Labor is the most sacred thing, and there is nothing lowly about being an "artisan." There is no shortage of people in Shanghai who started as "artisans," only scholars are useless. "Artisan" is also interpreted as planning and production, Garden Notes: "All come from their planning and crafting." Planning and production often require a lot of brainpower, which is mental labor; okay, physical labor and mental labor are all gathered in one "artisan," "artisan" is such a noble profession—

Well said, Shi You!—"Support the declining," means that people are troubled by chronic illnesses; when people get sick, it's like a moving machine temporarily "breaking down." When a machine breaks down, you can only ask an artisan to repair it. Seeing a doctor as an artisan who repairs machines of flesh and blood and welcome them, the ancient meaning and today's principles are all consistent. Shi You's use of words is: clever and appropriate, nothing more can be added. We clinical medical people ask ourselves, are we doing our best to repair the sick human body? Naturally, a machine that is completely broken cannot be repaired by anyone; but, dare to say that everyone has "devoted their best" to it? Only the two words "medical artisan" can express the nature of our profession and the noble character. Therefore, I differ from some people's views and do not hate the word "artisan," but find it refined and lovely. Many things that are not pleasing to the eye may calm your mind and ease your emotions after understanding the reason. "Foolishness causes trouble, all because of lack of understanding," recalling the "Fake Phoenix, False Emperor" storm, I can't help but feel this way, which greatly deviates from the way of mental hygiene, using "medical artisan" to show its commonness.

### The Remodeling of Medical Skills and Intelligence

— Qu Dianhong

The medicine of the atomic age is, after all, trending towards atomization. Although the current stage of development doesn't yet allow you to buy a bottle of "intelligence pills" at will to improve your work ability and comprehension, don't worry! This possibility is no longer an empty fantasy.

In the past, medicine was simply helpless when dealing with a child with slow thinking. Scientific progress could only allow us to prove in various ways that a person's intelligence was not up to standard. As for how to improve their intelligence, we had to wait for future inventions. Fortunately, there is a group of pioneers in the medical field who are working hard regardless of cost. As a result, they gave a substance called Glutamic Acid to a child whose intelligence could not keep up with the norm. After six months, they obtained a surprising conclusion: the child's intelligence suddenly progressed rapidly at an exceeding rate within these few months!

What secrets does Glutamic Acid have? Even the doctors who invented Glutamic Acid cannot give you a precise and detailed answer. However, they do know that this substance is closely related to the highly effective chemical substance Acetylcholine. According to scientists' research and experiments, we already believe that Acetylcholine can promote the transmission of information and commands within the nervous system. In other words, the existence of Acetylcholine is an essential element for maintaining the normal state of the nervous system. Based on the above two points of confidence, it is not difficult for us to speculate that taking Glutamic Acid can directly increase the production of Acetylcholine and indirectly promote the activity of the nervous system.

Let us imagine that our brain is a crystal of countless intricately mixed nerve cells. If your brain is normal, then no matter how astonishingly large the number of cells is, there must be a close connection between them. Scientists cannot completely explain how they achieve this mysterious connection. They can only speculate that this may be due to the effects of electrical waves and chemistry. If you can come up with a way to strengthen the impulses of the nervous system, then you can improve your intelligence. The method we are going to try is to use Glutamic Acid to increase Acetylcholine production.

Glutamic Acid has been around for a long time, but only in the last decade have people realized its hidden power. Frederick Zimmerman, a famous professor at the Columbia University Institute of Neurology, and his friend Sharmann Ross once used rats to conduct experiments. They made a large maze-like box and placed food at the end of the box. Then, they put a group of normal, healthy rats that had been selected beforehand into the box (half of which were fed a daily dose of Glutamic Acid). As a result, half of the rats were like ants in a hot pot, rushing around blindly, while the other half of the rats that had eaten Glutamic Acid were different. They quickly ran out of the maze and reached the end of the box. Later, K.E. Alder and C.J. Warden also used rats to conduct similar experiments. They made a wooden box with four wooden boards placed horizontally in the box, and food was placed at the end of the box. According to the records, rats can cross two wooden boards without any difficulty; if they take some time and effort, they can cross three wooden boards, but no matter how hungry they are, three wooden boards is the highest limit. Later, they fed them Glutamic Acid, and as a result, Glutamic Acid had an amazing effect. The rats eventually crossed all four wooden boards and obtained the food. This Glutamic Acid experiment made us think of a question: if Glutamic Acid can do this for rats, then what about humans? As soon as this question came to mind, someone buried themselves in research. As a result, three medical researchers, J.C. Pricej, H.W. Calch, and Tracy Puteam, discovered that Glutamic Acid can treat petit mal epilepsy, reducing the frequency of seizures and the suffering of patients. For example, a twenty-five-year-old young man injured his brain as a child and suffered from Petitmal Epileptic. As a result, 12 grams of Glutamic Acid per day not only stopped the epileptic seizures, but also changed his previous sluggishness. Seven months later, he stopped taking Glutamic Acid, and during the period of discontinuation, he returned to his previous condition. For example, a child with delayed development, actually two years old, could not speak or walk; not to mention speaking and walking, he didn't even have the energy to play. Dr. Zimmerman also tried Glutamic Acid. After a month, the child was happily building blocks. Later, because his appetite was affected, Glutamic Acid was temporarily discontinued. Heavens! The child lost interest in building blocks again, and he returned to his previous sluggish state! There was no other way but to give him Glutamic Acid again (initially in small amounts, then gradually increasing). Strangely, the child happily built blocks again, and after six months, the child could walk!

Many experiments have also been done on the relationship between Glutamic Acid and intelligence. The conclusion is that Glutamic Acid can indeed increase the intelligence quotient by eight to eleven. To put it more clearly, the rate of intelligence progress can be increased by two times.

Glutamic Acid can not only improve intelligence, but it can also improve human personality. A sixteen-year-old girl, on the surface, seemed very normal, with no problems at all, but she frowned all day long, didn't like making friends, and was even more afraid of socializing. She didn't feel the slightest interest in the various subjects at school. Later, after giving her 12 grams of Glutamic Acid every day for five months, her personality changed drastically. She smiled all day long, automatically participated in various activities, and her school grades improved greatly. There was also a twelve-year-old boy, who should have been a carefree and lively child, but that was not the case. He moved slowly, couldn't concentrate his thoughts, and sometimes lost his self-control, even speaking incoherently. Glutamic Acid was tried again, first three times a day, each time. Result: no improvement was seen; so, the dose was increased, three times a day, each time. This time, Glutamic Acid's power came. The child became active and the previous nervousness completely disappeared.

Although the Glutamic Acid experiment has achieved considerable success, we cannot be satisfied; because the results of the experiment also tell us that its effectiveness is not sustainable. After taking it continuously for a year, even if you continue to take it, the rate of increase in intelligence progress will gradually decrease, and taking too much has also caused side effects of insomnia and anxiety (although there is no fixed standard for the dose, the daily amount should not exceed 24 grams). So, we still have to do more experiments to study and improve. We want to enhance our intelligence, so we must first make full use of our existing intelligence!

### Precocious Puberty

— Wang Meixian

"Five-Day-Old Baby Girl Exhibits Signs of Puberty"

A few weeks ago, Shen Bao had a news dispatch that sensationalized Fuzhou City: "The wife of Wang Wencheng, a resident of Shishi Lane in Xiamen, gave birth to a baby girl the day before yesterday. Everything was normal after the birth, but yesterday, the nurse who delivered the baby found that the baby girl's breasts were high and protruding, and breast milk was overflowing. She also had menstrual phenomenon. A five-day-old baby has signs of puberty, and the news has spread far and wide." Normal girls will not have high and protruding breasts and menstrual periods, which are signs of puberty, until they are fourteen or fifteen years old. How could a five-day-old baby girl have signs of puberty?

According to the above report, it looks just like a case of "congenital female precocious puberty" in medicine. Apart from reasons of chromosomes or genetic factors, there is no way to explain its cause; so, it can only be given the title "congenital" to represent it. This type of congenital precocious puberty in women is actually more common than that caused by granular cell tumors, but general gynecologists often tend to think of this etiology first, leading to opening the abdominal cavity and taking a biopsy for examination. The difference between congenital precocious puberty and that caused by granular cell tumors is that not only are there menstrual periods, but ovulation can also occur, which means that young girls can also become pregnant and give birth if they have the opportunity. In 1940, a girl in Lima, Peru, who was only five years and eight months old, gave birth to a full-term baby, a girl who still needed to be taken care of by others, actually became a mother. According to Novak's report, there are nine cases of congenital precocious puberty, with ages ranging from fifteen months, two years, two years and eight months, four years, four and a half years, six and a half years, seven years, and seven and a half years, etc. (see Amer.J.Obs.&Gyp47.20.1944). It's just that no one in China has compiled reports, but only treats it as news reports.

What should you do if you encounter such a case of congenital precocious puberty? It is best to use physiological treatment methods to avoid the little girl developing a kind of awkward, inferior, or abnormal psychology. At the same time, strictly avoid contact with the opposite sex before the appropriate age, so as to avoid accidents such as fertilization and childbirth. This, of course, is what parents should pay attention to.

### An Overview of Biological Products

— Wang Meixian

Due to the discovery and widespread application of sulfonamide drugs, penicillin, and streptomycin, there are already methods for preventing and treating Gram-negative Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis, and Gram-positive Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Therefore, the production and application of this type of vaccine serum has been discontinued in recent years. We very much hope to have chemical or antibiotic products that are easy to manufacture, low in cost, accurate in potency, and can be mass-produced to replace biological products, but as of now, many pathogenic bacteria (typhoid fever, tuberculosis, pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, etc. bacilli and cholera vibrio), rickettsiae (typhus, trench fever), and viruses (smallpox, rabies, influenza, etc.), have no appropriate and effective chemical or antibiotic drugs invented yet. Biological products are still the only good method for targeted prevention and treatment, and bacterial immunology is still constantly discovering and improving. Therefore, we hope to take a two-pronged approach, advancing on both fronts, to annihilate pathogens and ensure human health.

If you want biological products to maintain good potency, then you must pay close attention to the preservation methods. Generally, they should all be stored in a cool, dark place. The expiration dates are marked on all products. These are all based on reasonable storage methods. If the preservation is not appropriate and they are exposed to heat and light, they will quickly lose their efficacy. For example, if smallpox vaccine is stored at 0 degrees Celsius, it can remain effective for six months. If it is placed at room temperature for two or three months, it will lose its efficacy. Various bacterial vaccines stored at 5 to 10 degrees Celsius can maintain their effectiveness for 9 to 12 months. Various serum antitoxins stored at zero degrees Celsius can be stored effectively for two years. At present, pharmacies, hospitals, and practicing physicians in our country mostly do not have appropriate water tank equipment, as well as transportation and delivery, and they should indeed pay attention to the potency and preservation of the products.

Biological products can be completely manufactured domestically, without relying on foreign goods. Generally, Chinese people have always thought that "foreign goods are always better than domestic goods." I dare not judge other goods arbitrarily, but domestic biological products are stronger than foreign goods. Because the various products made abroad are all made with foreign strains, which may not be suitable for the strains prevalent in our country. We use the strains prevalent in our country that are the most immune-rich to make the products, which are closer in nature, and can exert their immune power more after injection. Therefore, the import of this type of product should be prohibited to save foreign exchange. Even if they are aid or relief items, it is better to exchange them for domestic machines or raw materials that cannot be made, which is more practical.

Biological products, whether used for treatment or prevention, are injections, and are directly related to human life. Therefore, whether the products are pure and good, whether the potency is accurate, and whether they are qualified in terms of physics and chemistry, should all be carefully and precisely tested in advance before they are used in the human body. Guansi has the "Bacteriology and Immunology Products Management Regulations," which have regulations for managing domestically manufactured and foreign-introduced products, but unfortunately they are not strictly enforced. Unregistered and unlicensed products flood the market and sell well in various provinces, cities, counties, and towns. There are rumors that healthy horse serum is being sold as tetanus antitoxin, that plague vaccine is manufactured by killing avirulent plague bacilli, and that smallpox vaccine is not tested at all, but is highly diluted and sold. It is hoped that these are just rumors and not facts. It should not happen that products related to human life, biological products, are manufactured乱造, and the work is stolen. Private manufacturers must strictly comply with the laws and regulations, and public manufacturing organizations must also have regulations for random inspection and testing, executed or tested by the Ministry of Health. There should also be a standard and reasonable regulation on the manufacturing, testing, and application methods of various biological products, and if they are implemented conscientiously, the health of the nation will be guaranteed.

### What is Common Sense? What is Esteemed by the Medical Profession?

— Bridge Dweller

"Common sense," such a popular term, or rather, such a widespread buzzword, what exactly does it contain? To say, "So-and-so doesn't even have common sense," is as insulting as it gets. But what exactly is the content of common sense?

Given the complex state of modern society, the "everything-but-the-kitchen-sink" of the three hundred and sixty professions can no longer encompass everything. Moreover, each profession has its own specific developments, so the ABCs of those within the profession, that is, the basic common sense of each profession, is no longer something outsiders can fully understand. May I ask, what is "thirteen points"? What is "taking advantage of someone"? Would a "Beijing slicker" who always stays in Beijing know? May I ask, what is "radish in the twelfth lunar month"? Would a young master who always hangs out in foreign establishments know? To say that they don't even have this bit of common sense would be truly unjust!

In the past, Empress Wu Zetian's relative, Wu Sansi, had a—or rather, two—profound saying: "Those who are good to me are good people, and those who are not good to me are not good people." I think, in this situation of ideological divergence and mutual deception, to come up with a definition of "good" and "not good," perhaps Mr. Wu Sansi's words are the most straightforward. Everyone, I'm not just rambling in circles; I want to use this example to try to define common sense: "Basic knowledge that is useful to me is common sense, and basic knowledge that is not useful to me is not common sense." In that case, why should those proud sons of "drivers getting rich" and "hardware kings" know Confucius? The three words "Confucius" should definitely not be included in their common sense. Yet they all know Confucius; this is a waste. Why is there such a waste? For the sake of appearances! Much knowledge is for the sake of appearances, all wasted effort, strictly speaking, truly unnecessary. I regret that I know Confucius, and I regret even more that I know both Elder Dong and Elder Kang, the Dong-Kang Elders, but I don't know how to grab hats or eat plates, to the point of being so down and out. This is about general common sense.

Medical common sense is naturally another part within general common sense. What should we know? It's still that same phrase, and we shouldn't say "we," but only "I" or "you": "What is useful to you." If you are an old man, perhaps you will pay attention to "unparalleled virility"; if you are an athlete, perhaps you will pay attention to Vitamin B. However, nowadays, "people with common sense" don't have to be old men or athletes to pay attention to these magic weapons. As a result, almost everyone has to swallow a "multivitamin" pill every day. Undoubtedly, there is a lot of waste in this, but it seems this has also become a kind of "common sense facade."

Everyone, during times of frugality, it wouldn't hurt to be frugal with common sense as well; reduce a little facade, reduce a little waste. However, what is truly useful to me, what is truly useful to you, is indeed difficult to rigidly define. Even if it is objectively defined, it may still not pass subjectively. For example, I don't necessarily need to know things like "Uranium-235" at all, because it doesn't help my life at all, it can be said to be extremely useless, yet I remember it. For example, you, if you have open tuberculosis, you absolutely must avoid spreading it to others, but what percentage can do that? Smoking and alcohol are harmful, that's common sense, right, but the liquor and tobacco merchants' businesses are thriving and their wealth is abundant. Closing the door and surrounding a fire basin has the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning, also common sense, right, but a certain geologist still got carbon monoxide poisoning in the hospital. This is about medical common sense. Alas, common sense!

### On the Translation of Old Poetry

— Lei Hong

Translation is truly a laborious and thankless task. For translations that are faithful to the original work, readers often need to have a foreign language brain in order to read them without feeling a headache. If the translation is adapted to the style of Chinese language, it is inevitable that the meaning will be sacrificed for the sake of words, losing the spirit of the original work. Yan Fu's proposed highest goal of translation: faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance, is truly a difficult ideal goal to achieve; Yan Fu himself was unable to fully achieve this.

As someone who engages in translation work, all that can be done now is to seek an approximation to the original work within the boundaries of literal and free translation, and it is impossible to create a copy of this original work in another language. Lu Xun translated literary masterpieces, strictly advocating the method of literal translation, but I must admit that his translation of "Dead Souls" was a failure; if one doesn't read it with extreme patience, one often has to close the book halfway through. Luo Jinnan's translation of "A Tale of Two Cities," although using literal translation, seems to be much more fluent, but a friend told me that he found it very difficult to read the translation and did not finish the book. Among the translated works I have read, Mao Dun's translation of the collection of short stories of weak nations, "The Peach Garden," is a very fluent translation. Perhaps because Mao Dun's translation was based on an English translation, the wording has been refined and there are no roundabout phrases, making it easier to translate into Chinese.

In recent times, some have translated classical Chinese into vernacular, translating the Three Hundred Tang Poems and turning them into vernacular poems. I feel this is a waste of translation. The Three Hundred Tang Poems are representative works of various poets, with strict syntax, clean and concise, sometimes requiring no annotations at all. Why translate them into vernacular? Moreover, in contrast, these vernacular poems appear weak; those who only understand vernacular Chinese cannot appreciate their essence. And today's general intellectuals mostly have some understanding of old poetry; reading vernacular poems makes them feel like the ugly woman of Dongshi imitating the beautiful woman of Xishi. If you can write vernacular poems, just write vernacular poems. Wasting your own energy and other people's newsprint to translate such incomprehensible things, do you really want to strive to become an empty literary figure?

### The Japanese Crown Prince's Female Teacher

— Chen Xiang

The education of the Japanese Crown Prince is undertaken by a woman—Elizabeth Gray Vining, a Quaker from Philadelphia—which is a first in history.

Before the age of twelve, Akihito, the eldest son of Hirohito, was always strongly protected from all female influences, even the influence of his own mother. He lived in a male world.

Since the American forces occupied the Japanese archipelago, the situation has changed. Hirohito, who changes with the wind, proposed to the court to hire an American woman with a good educational foundation and a Christian faith as his son's "tutor." After the recommendation of Dr. George Stoddard, a New York State education commissioner who inspected education in Japan, Mrs. Vining was nominated and selected. Mrs. Vining believes that her selection was due to her Quaker training and her two award-winning books for children.

Mrs. Vining landed in Yokohama in October 1946. Her annual salary is two thousand US dollars, plus room and board and heating. Her translator and secretary is a young Japanese woman chosen by the Imperial Household Ministry who studied in the United States for five years.

The Japanese Imperial Family is extremely satisfied with Mrs. Vining's performance in her first year, so they renewed her contract for another year. The scope of her influence is gradually increasing. She is now also educating Akihito's three sisters, his younger brothers, and the Japanese Empress.

Mrs. Vining teaches all subjects in English. One of the first things she did was teach Akihito to play tennis. She drew a diagram of the court, placed the ball, and taught him English words like "ready" and "score." These numbers are easily transferable to other things.

The books read by the Japanese Crown Prince emphasize the importance of cooperation. These books all tell stories of boys and girls working together.

Mrs. Vining was once authorized by the Imperial Household Ministry to preside over the "Peer's School," which trains Japan's future leaders, educating seventy-eight male students. This school is now wide open, and children from all walks of life can enroll as long as they pass the exam. In addition to private lessons with Mrs. Vining, Akihito is also a student at this school, which is the first time in Japan that the Crown Prince receives basic education with other boys. Mrs. Vining explained that Akihito is happy and unconstrained there, just like when he is with his parents in the palace. He usually lives and eats with his attendants at a Japanese-style location about twenty miles west of the center of Tokyo. Akihito spends most of his time with his classmates in their dormitories.

In addition, Mrs. Vining also teaches at the "Ladies' School." Japanese royal schools used to be segregated by gender, but now it is part of a plan to eliminate the sharp inequalities between the sexes in Japan.

When Mrs. Vining's work is completed, Akihito may go to the United States to study abroad. And the work of an American woman may have an unspeakable impact on the future of seventy-eight million Japanese people.

### The Signature of a Famous General

When General Stilwell was in San Francisco, a Chinese child asked him to sign for remembrance. To show his goodwill, Stilwell signed his name in Chinese. He thought this was the proper courtesy to a Chinese child.

"Heaven knows!" The child grumbled after Stilwell left, "Counting it as a four-star general, I can't see what he wrote!" (Camel)

### Small Statistics

— Dao Xian

Hawaii is the sweetest place in the world, with 73% of its arable land planted with sugarcane. The yield per acre is as high as one hundred tons. The harvest in 1947 reached 100 million US dollars. 90% of the world's pineapples are supplied by Hawaii.

The population of the United States accounts for 6% of the world's population, but Americans own three-quarters of the world's cars, one-half of the radios, and more than one-half of the refrigerators. The United States consumes one-third of the world's wool, one-quarter of the cotton, one-third of the soap, and more than one-half of the rubber.

Fort Knox in the United States holds 892,000 gold bricks, each weighing 27 pounds, with a total value of approximately 12.5 billion US dollars.

### Indian Philosophy

— Shi Yu

An experienced missionary was sent to an Indian tribe. Seeing many young men sitting in front of their huts all day, contemplating life, he intended to "therapize" them and earnestly advised them to go to the city to find work:

Indian (A): If I work, what good is it to me?

Missionary (B): You can have money! You can buy a lot of things!

A: Is that it?

B: You can be a foreman and have more money.

A: Is that it?

B: Ah! You can be a manager, if you work diligently!

A: If I'm a manager, what good is it to me?

B: If you're a manager, you'll have countless money, and you won't have to work anymore!

A: Heaven knows! Pale face (the Indian term for white people)! Am I not already working now? Why go to so much trouble to seek what I already have?

Americans row boats in the Atlantic Ocean, Indians row boats in their imaginations. Although the methods are different, the principle is the same. Americans look at the moon in the sky, eager to fly; Indians look at the moon in the sky, falling into deep sleep. From the moon, they think of the Weaver Girl, from the Weaver Girl, they think of all women, and the day passes like this. The next day, looking at the moon in the sky, they have another set of thoughts, and the year passes like this. The second year, looking at the moon in the sky, they have a set of even newer thoughts, and their whole life passes like this.

The Indians are undoubtedly the smartest people in the world; only they enjoy life most economically and effectively. You spent 45,000 yuan, painfully stepping into the cinema, for the sake of enjoyment. But they only need to daydream in front of their huts for free to get the same enjoyment. You watched, they thought. After watching, it's over; after thinking, it's also over. But the enjoyment is the same. Therefore, the Indians' philosophy is: if you want to make a coat, don't waste your energy borrowing from east and west; just think about wearing a coat. If you want to enjoy delicacies, don't go to a big hotel and get glared at by the waiters; just think about eating a full banquet. You only need to sit silently in a small room, thinking that you are living in those "good old days" without war or deception, eating eight yuan per dan of rice, gnawing on three copper coins for a big pancake, and you can't help but smile. If you think like this every day, think like this every year, then you are truly living in peaceful times!

In "emptiness" there is a golden house. In "emptiness" there are a thousand zhong of grain. In "emptiness" there is a beautiful woman. It's not that I'm encouraging you to have neurotic diseases, it's that the times are forcing you to do so.

### Remembering Yan Gao

— Zhou Leng

The corruption of the Yan Gao family has been historically determined. The stories of their clever plundering and extortion will not be discussed here. According to the Tianshui Bingshan Record, when their property was confiscated, there were at least more than 5,000 items. The important ones included: more than 32,900 taels of pure gold connected to gold utensils and jewelry, more than 2,027,000 taels of pure silver connected to silver utensils and jewelry, more than 3,800 taels of pearls, precious stones, amber, coral, and other treasures, more than 14,000 bolts of damask, silk, gauze, and fur, 57 houses, mansions, shops, and estates, more than 277,000 mu of fields, and that doesn't include loans, food, livestock, utensils, etc.

Undoubtedly, this wealth is evidence of corruption, and the enormity of the numbers is astonishing. However, I am not at all surprised by this, because they held power for twenty years. Twenty years of accumulation should of course result in this "achievement." Conversely, what surprises me is: why didn't the Song Dynasty restrain them earlier at any time during their tenure, and only start calculating the old debts after Yan Gao was dismissed and bought and sold houses? What surprises me even more is: the authorities dealt with this matter, knowing that this wealth was squeezed from the people, but did not use it to return it to the victimized families. Why did they issue an imperial edict, "confiscating everything and sending it to the ministry, not allowing relatives and acquaintances to embezzle or accept it on consignment?"

From this deeper layer, it can be observed that the Song Dynasty had more cases of confiscating the property of corrupt officials than any other dynasty. And from Liu Jin, Qian Ning, Jiang Bin, to Yan Gao, and He Shen, all those who made great fortunes by relying on their official power ended up in the same way, and the authorities' handling methods were almost the same: "Property to the government." In the home-ruled dynasty, the government naturally belonged to the emperor personally. And the naive common people, of course, do not understand the subtleties of this.

Yan Song probably saw this principle, because according to the preface of the Tianshui Bingshan Record, the Old Man of Nancun said: "When Weng (Song) was dismissed from the prime ministership and returned home, he examined his private collection and saw 300,000 gold and 2 million silver, and exclaimed: "This is a disaster waiting to happen! It should be offered immediately, or hoping to avoid the trouble." But Shi Fan led the family to cry around and stopped him." It's a pity that he didn't make up his mind at the last moment, and still fell for someone else's trick!

I am not defending Yan Song and other corrupt officials. I am only pointing out that although Yan Song is detestable, Yan Song, and even other corrupt officials, ended up in such a situation because they fell for the "Emperor's" secret plan.

### Carefree Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 8: Success Falls Short (50)

Feng Sheng held up her index finger and said: "Second condition, we don't have to announce the divorce, just sign a private agreement with you. When I'm unhappy and want to cancel it, it must be canceled, you can't cancel it, dare you do it?" Zhu Qi nodded repeatedly and said: "This is also possible." Feng Sheng raised her middle finger again and said: "Third condition, after our divorce, you must not remarry, and I must not remarry." Zhu Qi couldn't help but chuckle and said: "According to these conditions, why do we need to divorce?" Feng Sheng said angrily: "Then you want to marry another one!" Zhu Qi was silent. Feng Sheng was extremely angry, stretched out her index finger and poked Zhu Qi on the forehead, saying: "You ungrateful thing, I knew your intentions long ago, so, you can remarry, but you have to be careful, I have the power to cancel the divorce agreement, I am the legal wife, you marry a concubine, I have the power to control her." Zhu Qi said: "Whether I marry or not is still not up for discussion, whether you have the power to control is even less up for discussion. I only ask you, are there any other conditions? If there are only these two conditions, I will agree." Feng Sheng said: "If you dare to agree, write the agreement." Zhu Qi had already prepared a draft in his stomach, and as soon as he heard her tell him to write, he immediately found paper, took out a fountain pen, and wrote it down. In less than ten minutes, two divorce agreements were written. He handed the fountain pen to Feng Sheng and said: "Please sign it!" Feng Sheng took the fountain pen, completed the signature, couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness, tears rolled down, threw the pen on the table, took two quick steps and lay on the bed crying. Zhu Qi looked at her, feeling a little unbearable in his heart. He supported his head with one hand, leaned diagonally in front of the table, and hesitated in his heart, feeling that it was morally wrong to play with her like this. So he walked to the bed, gently patted Feng Sheng on the back and said: "Don't be sad, we must still maintain our feelings, I will still come to see you constantly, if you have anything, I can still try my best to help." Feng Sheng pushed Zhu Qi away and cried: "Get out of here, I won't lie, since we are divorced, what feelings are there! Don't deceive me anymore, I won't be deceived by you anymore, go! go! No need to use sweet words anymore, I have seen through your heart!" Zhu Qi was rejected by her, so he didn't say anything else. He took out five million yuan in banknotes from his pocket and placed them next to Feng Sheng's pillow, saying: "I'll give you this little money first, if it's not enough, you can notify me by phone, I'll come to see you again." Saying that, he gently patted her on the shoulder and back twice and said: "You must take care of your health, we all have our own futures." Feng Sheng was already crying like a weeping woman. Zhu Qi quietly left the room. He walked to the door and met the Zhang Ma who was serving him and instructed: "The young mistress is angry, you serve her well." Then he went outside, opened the wardrobe, packed a small suitcase with his clothes, and took it out. Zhang Ma sent him to the door and asked when he would come back. Zhu Qi said: "I'm going to Tianjin, I can't come back in the next few days." Then he hired a tricycle to the bank dormitory, settled everything, and sent an urgent telegram to Qi Wan.

### Record of Humiliation

— Jia Yi

The tram station was crowded with people, and I deeply regretted being late today. Usually, if I arrived at the station before 7:30, I would never encounter so many people squeezing to wait for the bus; it was already 7:45, and there were only 25 minutes left before class. One, two trams sped by, fully loaded with passengers, and drove past the station without stopping. I anxiously shouted, "Damn"—the word "Mom" was just about to come out, when my eyes lit up, and I caught sight of a beautiful young woman walking up to me; I quickly changed my sentence to: "This is outrageous! Why doesn't the bus stop at the station?"

The third bus finally stopped at the station, and the iron door of the bus was right in front of the young woman in front of me. Logically speaking, as soon as the door opened, she could step onto the bus; but in an instant, the crowd behind and on both sides rushed forward. The people on the left grabbed the hands of those on the right, blocking the people on the right; the people on the right also insisted on stepping forward with their left feet, blocking the people on the left; for a moment, they were all squeezed together, and no one could get on the bus. A great force behind me was pushing me. Normally, I might impatiently turn around and curse a few times, but at this moment, I took the opportunity to push the female passenger in front of me up. Of course, I also closely followed. She never turned her face around, and I think she was probably used to this kind of treatment when squeezing onto the bus. So I thought that in the future, if my wife wants to go out, I would rather spend more money to hire a tricycle than let her be "pushed" onto the tram.

The inside of the carriage was impossible to squeeze into, so I had to stay next to the driver. The driver was complaining that he couldn't drive because he was squeezed so tightly. I took the opportunity to ask him why the previous bus didn't stop at the station? The driver glanced at me and didn't say anything back.

It was already five minutes past eight. I would be late for school today, and it was hateful that the driver, while complaining that people were squeezing him, still stopped at every station, always allowing one or two more people to squeeze on. I saw that the young woman in front of me was really squeezed uncomfortably, so I said to the driver: "The bus is already so crowded, if no one is getting off at the station, don't stop, just drive straight ahead."

"Hey! What did you say just now? You cursed the first two buses for not stopping at the station. You said one thing when you were down there, and you say another thing when you're on the bus! Look at your gentleman, he seems to be knowledgeable, how—how—? Alas! This is just the temper of the Chinese."

The young woman turned her face to me again and smiled mockingly. She was beautiful, but at this moment I really couldn't stand it. My face was tingling and hot. I turned my eyes to look at the bus, and fortunately none of my students were on it, otherwise. I could only think of one sentence: "If rituals are lost, seek them among the barbarians" is indeed correct.

### Strange Anecdotes

— Wu Yong

The lawyer defended the defendant: "Please note, Your Honor, the defendant did not break into the house at all. He simply saw that the window was open, reached his right hand in, and took a few insignificant things. It must be known that the defendant's hand is not equal to the defendant himself. How can the defendant be punished for what one of the defendant's arms did?"

The judge said: "Your argument is very reasonable. I will now, according to your theory, sentence the defendant's arm to one year of imprisonment. Whether the defendant goes to jail with the arm can be decided at the defendant's convenience."

After hearing the verdict, the defendant happily removed his soft arm and walked out of the courtroom.

After telling a story about a little sheep who left the flock without permission and was eaten by a wolf, the teacher said to the children: "You see, if the little sheep could obey and not leave the flock, it would not have been eaten by the wolf, right?"

The child replied: "Teacher, that's right, then it would have been eaten by us."

A female salesperson walked into the home of a taciturn person and asked, "Is the wife at home?" The owner replied that she was not at home.

The female salesperson asked, "Can I wait for her for a while?"

"It doesn't matter, please sit for a while."

The female salesperson waited for a full hour and couldn't help but ask, "Where did your wife go?"

"She went to the cemetery."

"May I ask when she will be back?"

The owner answered cautiously, "I don't know. She's been gone for eleven years."

### In Memory of Mr. Tang Dingzhi

— Huang Yanpei

Returning after the calamity, I threw away the pen and talked, with a hundred things on my mind and my mouth closed, yet the writing was clear and strong as before, perhaps it was still possible to extend life with illness.

Day after day I idled and did not move forward, I could not see him again in illness, and now I see him again weeping by the coffin, but I went to Song City to weep for Hui Lian.

In broad daylight I could glimpse the monsters passing, when I saw Cao Xiang, what could you do! Not knowing the difference between yesterday and today, the living and the dead are separated, which place has more ghosts!

Sages and sages all die after a hundred years, and Xin Qing is gone, and Tao Yi is also gone, but you and I were born in the same year, what sorrow is there for short and long lives! The misery of the masses has not yet dissipated, of life and death it is all boring! Cherish the writings of the good son, and do not scatter and burn the remaining scraps.

### Retention Fee

— Yan Ping

The winter vacation is almost upon us. Although the holiday has not yet started, parents are already feeling serious distress and worry about their children's education. The semester's academic report cards have not yet been seen, but they are first greeted with a notice demanding a "retention fee."

The retention fee seems to have become a "legitimate and justified" item. The school uses the excuse that the number of places is limited, and in order to favor existing students, those who pay the retention fee can keep their place; otherwise, new students will be recruited to make up the difference, so as not to reduce income. In reality, I think it's nothing more than using the name of "retention fee" to send out a batch for expenses. Especially at the end of the lunar year.

Fortunately, parents only want their children to have an education, and they won't quibble over a small retention fee, especially since the notice states that "those who fail to pay by the deadline will be treated as new students"?

I remember not long ago, the authorities issued an order prohibiting the collection of "retention fees." However, orders are just orders, and reality is reality! Some say that this order only applies to public schools, and private schools are not bound by it. In that case, doesn't the principle of "education regardless of public or private" suffer a blow?

If "retention" is a necessary procedure for studying, why must a "fee" be collected? And why does its amount have to be more than one-tenth of the tuition fee?

In my humble opinion, why not change the word "fee" to "note" or "letter," and at the start of the vacation, have parents issue an application form or the like, guaranteeing that their children will definitely not transfer schools next semester, and ask the school to register their place. In this way, the school can use the number of people retaining their place as a basis for management, budgeting, enrollment, etc., "benefiting both sides, public and private." I wonder what the education authorities think?

"The thing I love most about George is that he is always so calm and unhurried under pressure."
