### Remaining Ammunition and Air Force Equipment: US Agrees to Sell to China at Discount; MacArthur Declares He Cannot Leave Japan to Return to Country

[United Press International, Washington, 21st] The State Department submitted a memorandum to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, notifying Congress that US military aid has already begun its journey to assist China's anti-communist forces. The memorandum revealed that several contracts have been approved to sell surplus American war materials to the Chinese government at the lowest prices, including aircraft and ammunition. Diplomatic sources said that the Chinese loan technology delegation has also received assurances that the US Army will search for surplus aircraft throughout the Pacific region to provide aid to China.

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] The House has received a report proving that the United States has agreed to sell ammunition and air force equipment to China at a discount, but the total amount has not been disclosed. It is only known that it includes: (1) a contract signed on January 7, stipulating that surplus ammunition on the Mariana Islands will be sold to China at one percent of the original price; (2) a contract signed on January 30, stipulating that all surplus materials within the United States will be sold at a discount of 17.5 cents per dollar, with the exception of certain aircraft; (3) a contract signed on December 8 of last year, stipulating that 96 naval vessels under the Lend-Lease Act will be transferred to China free of charge, with an original value of $67 million. Last year, 130 million rounds of ammunition were sold to China at a discount of 10 cents per dollar, and 150 C-46 transport aircraft were sold at an actual price of $5,000 per aircraft, with an original price of $276,000 per aircraft.

[United Press International, Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Marshall warned Congress on the 20th that China has the possibility of collapsing without US assistance. If this were to happen, it would "make our situation in Japan extremely serious" and "the US position in Korea would be difficult to maintain." At the same time, Marshall acknowledged that Congress should expedite the legislation on the European aid plan and set aside aid to China until the European aid plan is passed. Marshall said that since China's "Third Party" is unlikely to take over the government, once the government collapses, everything north of the Yangtze River will fall entirely into the hands of the Communist forces. Regarding the "deterioration" of the Chinese military situation, Marshall said that the National Government's army "has no hope of victory unless there is a sound foundation and excellent leadership," conditions that cannot be resolved at present. The fatal wound of the Chinese military organization is "the drafting of ignorant rural youths who are directly sent to units for combat without training." When he was in China, he advised the Chinese government that these youths should be trained before enlisting, and he repeatedly told the Chinese government's officials, but although they expressed great agreement, they did nothing.

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] Republican Senator Judd, disregarding Secretary of State Marshall's opinion, repeatedly demanded military aid to China, and last night suggested inviting Chennault to fly back to Washington to present his views to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] Republican Senator Smith announced in the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 20th that he would request General MacArthur to return to the United States from Tokyo to guide aid to China and other Far Eastern issues. Democratic Senator Arrington said that foreign aid programs are extremely important to the United States and the world, and although no one has mentioned the widespread discussion of MacArthur as a Republican presidential candidate, he deeply resents using foreign aid programs to achieve his political goals. Speaker Eakins also said that this motion must be for political reasons.

[United Press International, Tokyo, 21st] General MacArthur issued a statement on the 21st: "American people advocate that I return to the country to state my opinion on the aid to China plan to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which shows deep love, and I am very grateful. However, I believe that the committee does not need to insist on the previous proposal. The current political situation in Japan is turbulent, and the government is in the process of transition. I am bound by my duties and cannot leave my post at this time."

### $570 Million in Aid to China Funds: US Releases Detailed Program; Shanghai Power Company to Receive Assistance

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The US State Department released the full detailed program of the $570 million aid to China plan on the 20th. This document is divided into eight sections, plus eight appendices, totaling 73 pages. The amount of aid to China calculated in US dollars in the document is as follows: (1) Up to June 30, 1949, a total of $510 million will be used to subsidize important inputs, including 225,000 tons of wheat worth $130 million and 451,300 tons of rice, 750,000 bales of cotton worth $150 million, and petroleum products worth $110 million (China's total needs, according to estimates, are petroleum worth $134,969,000, 25,000,199 barrels, but the aid to China plan stipulates $110 million). Fertilizer worth $30 million, tobacco worth $28 million (84.5 million pounds), non-ferrous products worth $24 million (17,588 tons) and steel products (115,373 tons), medicines worth $5 million, and spare parts worth $30 million for existing machinery and equipment. (2) $60 million will be used to subsidize various construction projects of the Shanghai Power Company, the Austrian-Hankow Railway, and the Ganxi and Hunan Xiangtan coal mines, possibly including the restoration of Taiwan sugar factories, Taiwan South China fertilizer plants, cement plants, and wharf facilities.

### Ambassador Stuart's Remarks: Explaining Motives for Writing to Chinese People

[United Press International, Nanjing, 21st] US Ambassador to China Dr. John Leighton Stuart met with a United Press International reporter alone on the 21st to explain the motives for publishing the "Letter to the Chinese People" two days ago, saying that he believed that the "best" solution to the China problem was to reopen negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Ambassador Stuart emphasized that this was his personal opinion and not necessarily the official attitude of the US State Department. Ambassador Stuart said that one of the motives for his decision to publish the letter to the Chinese people was that he believed that negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party might resume, but the ambassador also said: "Not the main motive." Ambassador Stuart explained his "main motive": "The reason why this statement was published is that I believe that the only hope for China and other countries to achieve democracy is that their people can recognize their rights and obligations. China is not short of selfless people. If they can effectively unite and promote the will of the people, then they can help the government benefit the country." The US ambassador said that his statement "was published on my own initiative, but with the full agreement of the State Department." Ambassador Stuart admitted that it is unusual for a foreign envoy to directly appeal to the people of the host country, but the ambassador continued: "In view of the seriousness of the situation in China, I believe that I have a friendly relationship with the Chinese people, so I went beyond my authority to point out that if the government, all sectors of the country, especially politically conscious non-partisans, can voluntarily unite, abandon internal strife, and seek solutions, then there is still a completely hopeful solution." Asked whether "various sectors" included communists, Ambassador Stuart replied: "I have always believed that the best solution is for the government and the Communist Party to reopen negotiations to reach a peaceful solution." Asked whether his "Letter to the Chinese People" should be interpreted as a criticism of the National Government, Ambassador Stuart declared: "I absolutely do not need to declare that this statement is not against the Chinese government. On the contrary, this statement is enough to help the government complete its goals. I have always believed that the leaders of the Chinese government are pursuing their goals without ever stopping."

### Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty: Extended for Fourth Time

[Associated Press, London, 21st] Moscow Radio broadcast a TASS report on the night of the 20th, stating that the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty signed in 1937 had a term of five years, and the term was extended for two years in 1942, 1944, and 1946.

### US Naval Fleet in Far East: Conducts Large-Scale Exercises; Badger Says US Navy is Sufficient to Deal with Any Contingency

[United Press International, this city] Two US cruisers and twelve destroyers rushed out to sea on the 21st to participate in large-scale simulated war exercises. The Western Pacific Fleet stationed in Qingdao and the Thirty-Eighth Task Force originally in Pearl Harbor both participated. The Western Pacific Fleet under the direction of Rear Admiral Kirk, including the cruisers Topeka and Duluth and eight destroyers, will meet between Okinawa and Hong Kong with the task force carrier Valley Forge and four destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Martin. The exercise was originally scheduled to be held in mid-January, but was postponed until now because the task force visited the east coast of Australia before coming to China. The Valley Forge and its affiliated destroyers sailed from Hong Kong on the morning of the 21st, and the Topeka and Duluth left Shanghai on February 18 and will meet with the destroyer fleet sailing from Qingdao at sea. The exercise includes strategic maneuvers and simulated warfare. After the exercise, the task force may return to Pearl Harbor, and the Western Pacific Force will be divided into two groups, with one cruiser and 1-2 destroyers coming to Shanghai, and the rest returning to Qingdao, so that Rear Admiral Badger can take over Kirk's post on February 14.

[Associated Press, Qingdao, 20th] The new commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet, Rear Admiral Badger, met with an Associated Press reporter alone here today and expressed his feelings on taking office: "The United States is fortunate to have a well-trained reserve fleet that is not afraid to deal with any naval contingency in the near future. The US Navy Reserve has a total of 900,000 members, and the training is very good and constantly improving."

### Gui Yongqing Flies to Qingdao: Meets Badger and Inspects Naval Academy

At 3:00 pm, Gui inspected the Naval Academy and gathered the Qingdao naval units for instructions. At 7:00 pm, Kirk formally invited Gui and Rear Admiral Badger to a banquet.

### British Trade Mission to China: Requests Opening of Dalian; Investigation Report Published

[Associated Press, London, 20th] The British Trade Mission to China published a report today stating: "It is difficult to expect an expansion of trade between China and Britain in the near future. The reason for this pessimism lies in the fact that China is still unstable. However, a deeply rooted nation will eventually overcome its difficulties. At that time, the development of trade between China and Britain will be unlimited." The mission was led by the Financial Secretary Cripps (then Minister of Trade) and led by Boss, Chairman and General Manager of the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company. They inspected China from October 8 to December 14, 1946, traveling about 8,000 miles. The report, which was drafted after returning to the country, is 50,000 words long and is now published. The report put forward suggestions to develop trade between China and Britain, the most important of which are: to open Dalian to facilitate international trade and to develop resources in the Northeast.

The report also stated that for many years to come, Hong Kong may still be the main port for trade with China, and the British government should send a trade representative to Hong Kong as soon as possible.

### National Assembly Delegates' Concession Issue: Resolved According to Law; Central Government Will Announce Interpretation According to Law

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Central Committee of the Kuomintang held a subcommittee meeting on the morning of the 21st to discuss and resolve the issue of party members in the National Assembly delegates conceding. Wu Tiecheng, Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, and others participated. The legal basis for signing the National Assembly delegate was discussed at the meeting. It was decided at the meeting to handle the matter according to law, and a legal interpretation will be announced within a few days to facilitate the handling. At the same time, many opinions were also raised on the issue of concessions to friendly parties. It is generally believed that the government is determined to fulfill its past promises in order to implement the ideal of party politics, and especially hopes that the lists submitted by friendly parties can be selected as much as possible. Therefore, it is currently seeking a reasonable path. (Continued on page 2, column 3)

### Tianjin and Beijing Loans for Purchasing Grain: Amount Not Rigidly Specified

Mayor Du Jianshi and Mayor He Siyuan have met with President Zhang of the National Bank several times in the past two days for this matter. It is now known that the decision today is to allocate funds as needed, without rigid specifications on the amount.

### Southwestern Sui "Northwest Government": Thoroughly Suppressed by National Army; Puppet Chairman Han Guoliang Captured and Sent to Province

[This newspaper, Beiping, 21st] The "Northwest Government" hidden in Zhulaxin Village, Tuoketuo County, Southwestern Sui, has recently been suppressed by the National Army's Sui South Command, Liu Wanchun. The chairman, Han Guoliang (nicknamed "Fortress Jade"), was also captured and escorted to Gui Sui. His five bodyguards also surrendered their weapons. It is reported that Zhu Village is located at the junction of Guisui, Salachi, and Tuoketuo counties, and the people are fierce. Han was originally a landlord who studied at Taiyuan School of Law and Politics. After returning to his hometown, he compiled his own Baojia and organized local militia. He also built a three-car bunker with a height of four Zhang and a thickness of five feet in the village. The people in the nearby seven or eight Bao all listened to his orders. When the Japanese invaded Guisui and Baotou, Han resisted for two years before fleeing south to the desert. After the victory, Han also returned to his hometown to resume his "Fortress King" life. He never paid grain to the government in his jurisdiction. The schools in the district did not use the national textbooks, but replaced them with his own "Book of Governing the Country and Pacifying the World." Last year, Tuo County sent more than 20 police officers to investigate the truth of the "Kingdom", and thousands of people under Han's rule beat them. Before the Lunar New Year, Yimeng Zhunqi was in distress. Liu Wanchun, commander of Southwestern Sui, fearing that Han would unite with the Communists, sent a team to suppress them and wiped them out in one fell swoop.

### Joint Board Discusses Loans: Principle of Not Increasing Currency Issue; Zhang Qun Instructs that Agricultural Loans Should Be Emphasized

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] President Zhang gave instructions on loan policy at the meeting of the Joint Board on the 21st, which lasted for half an hour. Zhang first said that the business policy of each bank and bureau this year should be carefully planned based on the instructions of the chairman, and special attention should be paid to agricultural loans to meet President Chiang's intention to develop the rural economy. For general industrial and mining loans, the principle of grasping production or avoiding increasing currency issue should also be followed. Zhang especially emphasized that the loan policy should be coordinated with the ten self-help plans related to financial and economic reform proposed by himself, and should also be coordinated with the implementation methods in the economic reform plan. Regarding the raising of funds, Zhang advocated that in order to avoid increasing issuance, it is best for each bank and bureau to raise funds on their own. The Central Bank will no longer provide rediscount and re-mortgage in the future. In this way, loans and issuance are separated, and the issuance will not be increased due to national loans, causing the disadvantages of inflation. Because the above principles are still awaiting final approval by Chairman Chiang, no affirmative decision was made at the meeting on the 21st. Regarding the deposit of funds from various military and political agencies, President Zhang emphasized that the "Measures for the Deposit and Remittance of Funds for Military Agencies" promulgated by the National Treasury Department in October last year should be strictly implemented, and all funds should be deposited in the Central Bank. Because at present, various agencies are unable to do this, especially after public funds are withdrawn and remitted to other regions, the National Treasury Bureau often cannot control them, which has a negative impact. Therefore, it should be corrected.

[This newspaper, Lanzhou, 21st] Representatives of public and private industrial and mining enterprises in Lanzhou visited Director Zhang Zhizhong and asked him to appeal to the central government to open up industrial loans in the Northwest.

Politics will follow the military to the countryside and take root in the newly opened areas. Retaliation is strictly prohibited.

[This newspaper, Tianjin, 21st] In order to strengthen bandit suppression, the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters is planning to establish a new organizational structure in various levels of units. The main spirit of the new system is to give each unit two functions: one is a rapid force and the other is a garrison force. The two cooperate and are used flexibly.

### Intense Battle on Three Sides of Lanfeng: Garrison Resists Firmly

[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 21st] Chen's 6th Column bandits, who invaded Lanfeng in eastern Henan, continued to attack the east, west, and north gates yesterday. The garrison resisted bravely, and the fierce battle is still in progress. In addition, Teng, the 10th Column bandit unit of Chen Yi's bandits, who fled south across the Longhai Railway, was strongly blocked by the National Army in Niuwangdui, north of Xiayi City, and Dahouji, west of the city, yesterday. The bandits suffered more than 2,000 casualties, and corpses were scattered everywhere. The remnants of the bandits fled south in a panic.

[This newspaper, Jinan, 21st] The remnants of Chen's bandit units, who fled back to southwestern Shandong, now total more than 50,000 people. Because of the National Army's fierce pursuit, more than 3,000 fled north across the Yellow River, and the rest are being encircled and suppressed by the National Army. The morale of the Communist bandits is declining, and they have no power to launch a major war.

### Gansu Chairman Guo Jixiao: Passes Through Shanghai and Jinjing to Report on His Work

### Mixed Train Derails on Shaosui Section of Yuehan Railway

[This newspaper, Guangzhou, 21st] The number of accidents and the amount of losses on the Yuehan Railway after the restoration is worthy of attention. At about 6:00 pm on the 19th, the 15th passenger-freight mixed train from Shaozhou to Guangzhou derailed south of Shakou, damaging more than 200 meters of track, the roadbed collapsed, and several people were injured, but fortunately no one died. Six trains were damaged. The Director of the Yuehan Railway Bureau has personally gone to the scene of the accident to investigate. Scheduled trains on the afternoon of the 20th were blocked.

### Naval Fleet Enters Yingkou: Morale and Spirit in Shenyang Greatly Boosted; Garrison in Anshan Retreats and Continues Fighting

[This newspaper, Shenyang, 21st] After the Battle of Anshan, there was great concern and regret here. The only thing that boosted the morale and spirit of the people here was the military's announcement: The naval fleet has entered Yingkou Port, where the river ice is just thawing. The garrison in Yingkou has been attacking and sweeping the surrounding bandits for days. The Benxi area, southeast of Shenyang, which is an important industrial and mining area, has recently been attacked by bandits. The bandits seem to have new plans. The bandits used a large force to cut off the railway traffic between Shenyang and Benxi. The Waitoushan Station between Sujiatun and Benxi is being attacked by the bandit army. The garrison there is a powerful team. As of the 21st, they have held out for 13 days. The air force flew to investigate and saw that the Waitoushan Station building and civilian houses were mostly in ruins, which shows the intensity of the battle. This battle fully demonstrates the fighting spirit of the defenders.

[This newspaper, Pan Yang, 21st] The Battle of Anshan has caused the greatest damage to the steel industry in the Northeast. The national steel production plan will be changed, and the focus will be shifted to Central China, according to industrial sources. According to Shao Yizhou, General Manager of Angang Steel, Anshan is one of the few steel industries in the Far East. After the takeover, it actively resumed work, and the hope was great. If it is destroyed by bandits, the restoration project will be arduous and unimaginable, and it may not be allowed by the country's financial resources. More than 500 specialized technical personnel are trapped in the encirclement. They are loyal to their duties and are all rare talents. Shao regrets this endlessly.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 21st] The National Army defending the iron capital Anshan has transferred to a new position after nine days and nights of hard fighting. After the bandits broke into the urban area on the 19th, they concentrated their artillery fire to attack our steel company. The northeastern highlands of the urban area and the Shahe Iron Bridge, Caowang Mountain and other positions were also violently attacked by the bandits. The defenders were in high spirits, charging back and forth, killing a large number of bandits. After obtaining a heavy price, they transferred to a new position according to the plan and continued fighting.

[This newspaper, Beiping, 21st] A major battle in western Liaoning is brewing. The Communist bandits gathered in Goubangzi and plan to cross the Daling River after the ice melts to threaten Jinzhou. It is reported that after the fierce battle near Shishan, it has become a vacuum zone. Powerful national troops are still based on the Daling River. Fan Hanjie's corps is still waiting for orders in the Jin-Yu section. If they cross the Daling River and advance to the east, they still need to increase their forces, because Li Yunchang's 9th Column of Communist bandits is also active in the Jin-Yu section to contain them.

### Zhang Zuoxiang and Others Fly to Shanghai and Transfer to Nanjing Today; Northeast Petition Group Heads South from Shenyang on the Same Day

[This newspaper, Beiping, 21st] Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, Ma Zhanshan, and Zhang Yuanfu are scheduled to fly to Shanghai by air Wang aircraft and transfer to Nanjing at noon on the 22nd. Wang Shuchang plans to go south by sea, but the date has not been set. Zhang and others are carrying a letter of advice to the central government, which is thousands of words long. The content is roughly the same as what this newspaper previously disclosed. Wan Fulin hosted a banquet for Zhang, Ma, and Northeast gentry at his residence in Beiping on the 21st to exchange final opinions.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 21st] The Northeast Petition Group personally organized by the Speakers of the Shenyang, Liaoning, Jilin, and Liaobei Provincial Councils decided to fly to Nanjing on a special plane on the 22nd. Wang Huayi will serve as the leader of the group, and Supervisory Envoy Gu Fengxiang was invited to accompany them.

### Marshall's Testimony on Aid to China Before the House Foreign Affairs Committee - Full Text

[United States Information Service, Washington, 20th] Secretary of State Marshall delivered testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the full text of which is as follows:

"When discussing aid to China, it should be clearly understood that the resolution of the China problem largely rests with the Chinese people themselves. The fundamental difficulty in determining the basis and procedures of an aid program lies in the military and economic situation in China. To date, the main obstacle to resolving China's economic problems has been the civil war. This civil war has depleted the Chinese government's domestic and foreign exchange resources, continuously damaged property, frequently disrupted economic life, and hindered recovery. The Communist forces have caused terrible destruction and harmed the Chinese economy, which is their declared aim—to force an economic collapse.

The Chinese government is currently in dire need of assistance amidst its severe economic difficulties. However, China's political, economic, and financial situation is so unstable and precarious that it is impossible to devise a practical, effective, and long-term overall economic recovery plan. Nevertheless, the United States government must provide assistance to China in its current dire situation to help delay the rapid deterioration of its economy, thereby giving it a breathing space and allowing the Chinese government to initiate important steps to achieve a more stable economy.

When considering this plan, there are multiple factors involved, and the following factors appear to be of greatest importance.

China is a vast country with a large population. North of the Yangtze River, transportation is almost non-existent, except for coastal navigation. Local governments are often deeply corrupt, and their assistance cannot be relied upon for administering relief measures. The political control of deeply entrenched groups poses a significant difficulty in restoring China's economic stability. The current civil war being waged, especially due to geographical disadvantages (exposed transportation and the length and difficulty of dealing with guerrilla warfare), requires a high level of proactive leadership at all levels of command, but in reality, such leadership is lacking. The civil war increases the national budget burden by more than 70%. Current financial measures rely entirely on issuing paper currency. Industrial production is low, and transportation equipment is deteriorating. The lack of transportation especially affects the delivery of food, resulting in rampant inflation and inevitable speculation and hoarding.

In considering the measures the United States should take to aid China, I believe it is essential to note that aid to China cannot be compared to aid to Europe. It is not yet possible to predict when aid can be terminated. As for a fund to stabilize the currency, according to our currency experts, a very large amount is needed, and such a fund would be largely wasted while the current civil war is ongoing. In this situation, the aid plan to China should not include an actual guarantee of China's economic future. The United States' actions should not assume direct responsibility for the behavior of the Chinese government in its political, economic, and military affairs.

The proposed aid plan to China will provide $570 million in economic assistance until June 30, 1949. Of this, $510 million will include the minimum necessary import of civilian goods, mostly food and raw materials, and the remaining $60 million will be used for major construction projects. The aid plan focuses on various materials, which are believed to provide the maximum possible assistance to the Chinese civilian economy and ensure that every dollar has the greatest impact.

The total amount of China's import needs cannot be accurately estimated given the general instability of production and trade, as well as the chaotic conditions in some areas. Therefore, we believe that the items listed in the plan can be determined reasonably well. The plan will meet the requirements for the most needed commodities. Of course, China still needs other imports, including civilian goods and military supplies not included in the plan. In addition, China has some international financial burdens.

To meet these additional foreign exchange needs, China can use some of its own financial resources. These resources include income from exports, remittances from overseas Chinese, the sale of surplus property, and miscellaneous income from expenses incurred by foreign governments and charitable organizations in China. Finally, if necessary, there are China's gold and foreign exchange reserves, which were estimated to total $274 million as of January 1, 1948. This amount can be increased if China improves its net income in foreign exchange. On the other hand, this amount may be reduced if there are no other funds to be raised and the reserves must be used to cover payments due after January 1, 1948.

In the proposed plan, it is recommended that the plan be handled by an organization established according to law, as the establishment of such an organization is aimed at handling various foreign aid plans, or, before the establishment of such an organization, temporarily handled jointly by the State Department and other relevant government agencies. The various conditions for granting this assistance should be stipulated in an agreement signed with the Chinese government. These conditions will be considered in the same way as the conditions for granting assistance to European countries, but adjusted according to the different circumstances in China.

The Secretary of State Presents a Document Outlining the Economic Aid to China Plan

In addition to answering questions from the committee members during his testimony, Marshall presented a document outlining the "Economic Aid to China Plan." In addition to analyzing the materials recommended for delivery under the aid plan, the document discusses in detail the plan's administration and other terms, the facts of China's economic position, previous U.S. economic assistance, and China's promises of self-help.

The listed materials, in addition to cotton, grains, and kerosene products, include fertilizers, tobacco, metals, medicines, coal, and essential spare parts.

The outline states that since 1937, the U.S. government's aid to China has totaled $2.9058 billion, of which $1.4369 billion was after the victory over Japan, including Lend-Lease, the sale of surplus materials, UNRRA relief (the U.S. portion), U.S. foreign aid program funds, and loans from the Export-Import Bank.

Regarding possible construction projects, the outline also states that China has separately applied for loans of approximately $300 million from the Export-Import Bank, but notes: "Under China's current circumstances, the Export-Import Bank is unlikely to approve these applications, but some projects may be eligible for Export-Import Bank loans in the future." The outline states that "the main reason the Export-Import Bank has rejected previous applications is that the bank cannot find reasonable guarantees of repayment."

The bilateral agreement implementing the aid plan will authorize U.S. administrators to determine individual construction projects under the $60 million item. The administrators will also have the right to modify the list of quantities of materials to be delivered. (The situation of the U.S. House of Representatives' inquiries is published in the left corner of the second page.)

Editorial

### The Final Stage of the Tokyo Tribunal

The Tokyo International Military Tribunal for the Far East's trial of Japanese war criminals has reached its final stage. At the 'final argument session' reopened on the ninth of this month, prosecutors and defendants each read their arguments and analyzed and reviewed all the evidence accepted by the court and the entire court record since the trial began 20 months ago, making their respective judgments. The defendants argued that the acts of war were based on self-defense and asked the court to acquit them. Chief Prosecutor Keenan, representing the prosecution team, vehemently attacked the defendants' fallacy of self-defense and loudly called for the death penalty for war criminals such as Tojo. The prosecutor's general indictment was completed on the 19th, and Keenan has returned to Washington, D.C., to return to Tokyo in a few weeks to hear the verdict. Now that the rebuttal stage between the prosecutors and defendants has ended, no more opinions can be expressed on the merits of the case. The next seven weeks will be a tense period for the judges' work. The weighing of each war crime and the decision of life and death are tied to the judges' votes and the drafting of the judgment. The importance of the Tokyo Tribunal is greater than the Nuremberg trials. The world is watching the outcome of the Tokyo Tribunal more closely than the Nuremberg trials. Our China has suffered the longest and greatest disaster from the invasion of Japanese warlords. We are concerned about the end of this major event and should express our opinions at this final crucial moment for the reference of the Far East Tribunal.

First, the issue of convicting Class A war criminals is based on the "Indictment of Japanese Class A War Criminals" by the United Nations prosecutors. The accused war criminals include 28 people, including Hideki Tojo and Doihara. Except for Yosuke Matsuoka and Osami Nagano, who died, and Shumei Okawa, who was exempted from prosecution due to mental illness, and escaped the "severe punishment" of Article 10 of the Potsdam Declaration, there are still 25 people. Since the secret trial began on May 3, 1946, until the end of the final argument stage, 21 months have passed. Exhaustive debates, cross-examinations, and individual justifications have given the defendants some favorable opportunities. They sit peacefully in Tokyo's Sugamo Prison, living a quiet life. Defense lawyers are creating "evidence of innocence" for them. Recently, the Tokyo Tribunal Research Association published "Hideki Tojo's Sworn Statement," a voluminous work of more than 200,000 words, which is popular among the Japanese people and still intends to win the final public opinion. Despite their sophistry, fabricating false evidence, and publishing fallacies, they cannot eliminate the facts of the blood debt and the verifiable evidence of crimes. The blood debts they owe to the world must be repaid and must be liquidated before justice. On February 11, Prosecutor Keenan accused these war criminals of launching wars of aggression, the greatest crime in the world, and conspiracy to violate peace. Their killings in the war of aggression are murder against humanity. If these crimes are not punished in this trial, the Potsdam Declaration will become a useless scrap of paper. We admire Keenan's righteous voice. We ask the judges of the court to accept the prosecutors' indictment and all the evidence of the crimes, and to pay attention to the trend of United Nations public opinion and quickly convict the Class A war criminals! Their crimes, first, are to undermine peace; second, to launch wars of aggression; and third, to violate humanity and have crimes of violating the laws and customs of war. According to jurisprudence and precedents, this group of criminals should be sentenced to death without mercy. If the crimes of these chief aggressors are of varying degrees of severity, and the majority or a minority go unpunished, the sacred law will be destroyed, and the highest moral standards that humanity adheres to will be separated, which will inevitably bring greater misfortune and disaster to the world situation and people's hearts. Therefore, we believe that in order to maintain the solemnity of the law and to implement the principle that "wars of aggression are crimes," we have the right to demand that this group of criminals be sentenced to death as soon as possible!

Second, the handling of unindicted war crime suspects. The Japanese war of aggression includes the "Mukden Incident," the Sino-Japanese War, and the Pacific War. Those who participated in the war preparation conspiracy and massacres include warlords, financial groups, bureaucrats, diplomats, and people involved in ideological culture. When General MacArthur landed in Tokyo, he arrested more than 100 war crime suspects in five batches. Most of the famous war criminals were arrested. Who knew that in the past two years, the prosecutors only filed public prosecutions against 28 people, including Tojo. The other criminals were not prosecuted. Some were released, and some were exempted from prosecution. Recently, Keenan again suggested to Washington, D.C. to release 20 war criminals, including many warlords with obvious crimes and bureaucrats who played an active role in the conspiracy to invade China, such as Nobusuke Kishi (Tojo's Minister of Commerce and Industry, one of the five rulers of "Manchukuo"), Kiichiro Higuchi (Commander of Rabaul), Shiro Nishio (Commander of the Japanese Army in China), Tada Hayao (Deputy Chief of the Army Staff), Yoshio Kodama (leader of the Kodama Zaibatsu in Shanghai), Tadasu Tani (Ambassador to the Wang puppet regime), and Teiichi Yoshimura (chief of the invading Chinese affairs). According to the February 16th news, Washington, D.C. has adopted Keenan's suggestion and will not interrogate Nishio and others. Not interrogating means "innocent," and "innocent" people are especially graced with release. We believe that this unilateral action is D'Artagnan. Our prosecutor Xiang Zhejun has objected and hopes that our government will take appropriate steps. We believe that the situation is urgent and request the Far East Tribunal and our government: first, at the end of the trial of Class A war criminals, the crimes of unindicted war criminals should be reviewed, and public prosecutions should be immediately continued so that war criminals with obvious crimes cannot escape the law; third, the unilateral release of war criminals should be protested, and any criminals who have committed crimes against peace and humanity in China should be requested to be extradited to China for trial according to law. We appeal to the Far East Tribunal and strive for the Far East Commission.

Third. Whether the Japanese Emperor should be regarded as a war criminal. The United Nations has very different opinions on whether Emperor Hirohito should be listed as a war criminal. According to the Potsdam Declaration: "The authority and power of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be permanently eliminated." This clearly refers to the Japanese "Emperor." Later, when Japan surrendered, it requested that the "Emperor" not be harmed, and the United States agreed. Whether the Japanese government should adopt the "Emperor system," according to the interpretation of the Potsdam Declaration, should be decided freely by the Japanese people, but the spirit of Potsdam cannot explain that "the Emperor is innocent," and many long documents show that the "Emperor" participated in the invasion plan. The Far East Tribunal's general indictment says that the Emperor will not be held responsible for war crimes, which is doubtful. We have no retaliatory psychology towards the Emperor. When the world carefully filters this issue, the Allied countries must conduct a clear study of right and wrong. Gandhi said: "Facts are three-quarters of the law." Gandhi forgave his enemies and opponents, but he demanded that right and wrong be clarified and the truth be purified.

In short, the Tokyo Tribunal is nearing its final stage. We are waiting for the Far East Tribunal to complete the sentencing procedure for war criminals before the Japanese cherry blossoms bloom, punish the main culprits who incited the war and harmed humanity, establish peace for the world, and extend justice for humanity. This is our wish.

Power Plants in Northeast and North China Destroyed by Bandits - Heavy Losses of Major Electrical Equipment

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] According to the announcement of the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan, after the victory, the Power Industry Commission of our country made every effort to reorganize and repair the power industry, and the power generation has made rapid progress, and the future can be optimistic. Unfortunately, the main power equipment is distributed in the Northeast and North China regions, which have been devastated by the Communist bandits, resulting in heavy losses. According to statistics, since the Communist bandits initiated the rebellion, as of the end of January 1948, the situation of the factories being destroyed by the bandits is as follows:

Shimowei Power Plant

The two power plants of Weishui and Shimen, which belong to the plant, were occupied by the Communist bandits on April 12 and November 10, 1937, respectively. The Shimen Power Plant is equipped with a 2,000 kW unit, and the Weishui Power Plant is equipped with a 5,000 kW unit. All the transmission lines between Weishui and Shimen and the distribution user equipment in the two places were lost. The details of the damage are now being investigated.

Qingdao Power Plant

After the Boshan Power Plant of the Zhangbo Power Supply Area Management Office of the plant fell into the hands of the bandits in February 1937, the Communist bandits intended to destroy the power generation equipment. After the local employees in the plant begged, they were spared from destruction. Some materials have now been recovered, and the looted power lines have also been damaged.

Northeast Power Plant

(1) Songfu Transmission Line. The Fengman Hydropower Plant of the Bureau currently has equipment that can generate 135,000 kW, accounting for about 65% of the total power generation in the Northeast. Most of it was originally sent to Fushun through the Songfu 220,000-volt transmission line to supply the needs of the southern valley of the Northeast. In May 1937, the line was destroyed by the Communist bandits, and the losses were very heavy. Moreover, most of the areas through which it passes are still occupied by the bandits, and repair work cannot be carried out. At present, Fengman's electricity cannot be exported, and the southern part urgently needs electricity. The supply and demand cannot be met, which has a great impact on the national economy and people's livelihood.

(2) Xi'an Branch and Power Plant. In May 1937, the Communist bandits launched their fifth offensive. The transmission lines between Xi'an and Siping and Xi'an and Kaiyuan were destroyed by the bandits one after another. On June 2, fierce battles in the suburbs of the city resulted in 70 or 80 bullets hitting the power plant. The water tower and the speed regulators of three boilers and one steam turbine generator were damaged by bullets. Three 6,000 kVA transformers were also destroyed. On June 3, the power plant and branch were captured and have not been recovered.

(3) Andong Branch. After the Communist bandits retreated from Andong at the end of 1936, the Bureau sent personnel to take over the local power business. When the Communist bandits collapsed, the three 37.500 kVA main transformers and other equipment and houses in the Andong First Substation were completely destroyed and could not be repaired. In addition, the transformers, equipment and houses of the Second Substations of Sidaogou 6 and Daogou were also severely damaged. After the branch took over, it was reorganized and actively restored until it retreated again in early June 1937.

(4) Siping Branch was occupied by the Communist bandits on June 21, 1937, and was recovered by the National Army in August of the same year. All the factory buildings of the branch were destroyed; most of the materials were also looted; 70% of the distribution lines were lost; one employee was killed, two were injured, and 21 were missing.

Beipiao Power Plant was occupied by the Communist bandits on June 30, 1937. The guard team and some employees of the plant participated in the defense war. Three workers were killed heroically. The lines were also damaged. It was recovered in November 1937, and lost again in January this year.

Jibei Power Company

The Tianjin-Tangshan transmission line of the company was destroyed by the Communist bandits six times from February 20 to December 12, 1937, with a total loss of 644 power poles and a total line length of 28 kilometers and 700 meters.

In terms of substations, there are (1) Hangu Substation, which was attacked by the bandit army on the night of June 17. One transformer was destroyed and two were damaged. On the morning of September 29, the station was captured by the bandit army again. One transformer was destroyed, and the magnetic head glass of another transformer was shattered. (2) Changli Substation was completely burned by the bandit army on May 18.

Hainan Power Plant. The Dongfang Hydropower Plant of Hainan Power Plant has an original power generation capacity of 5,000 kW and a transmission line length of more than 90 kilometers. Because the plant is located 40 miles away from Beili City, Ganen County, its location is remote and transportation is inconvenient, resulting in the erratic appearance of Communist bandits. Employees are often looted, and equipment is often damaged. Since August 1936, the external transmission lines of the plant have been damaged and sold repeatedly, with more than 20 repairs. A total of more than 50 kilometers of lines and more than 400 poles have been destroyed, resulting in heavy losses and difficulty in repair. The remaining line materials in 1937 have been exhausted, and there is no ability to purchase more. Moreover, the Communist bandits have intensified the destruction of railways, and external power supply cannot continue to be maintained. It has been partially dismantled and stored. This unavoidable measure has a great impact on the development of Hainan's industry.

### Detailed Program of US Aid to China

(Continued from page 1) The document states that China can obtain the difference in commodity needs from regions such as Canada and the British Commonwealth. The US State Department believes that the rapid deterioration of China's economy is due to the impact of the civil war on materials, currency, and finance. The impact on materials includes the destruction and disconnection of transportation and industrial equipment, and the interruption of sources of raw materials, food, and fuel. The impact on finance and currency is inflation, which has caused the monthly banknote issuance rate to increase from 10% in 1946 to the current 25%, and the government budget requires 40 trillion Chinese legal tender yuan, of which 70% is for military purposes, resulting in the continued decline of China's exports and formal income, and the increasingly declining source of foreign exchange. The implementation of this plan will give China a slight surplus in foreign exchange income, which is expected to be used to improve currency reserves and purchase important military supplies (as Marshall reported today). According to the State Department's estimate, from April 1, 1948, to June 30, 1949, in addition to those supplied under the Aid to China plan, China will spend US$55 million in foreign exchange to obtain important imports (for importing chemicals, dyes, paper, wood pulp, wood, rubber, and rubber products, etc.), plus US$75 million in foreign exchange spent by the government (interest payments on loans, expenses for overseas diplomatic personnel, etc.), totaling US$130 million. On the other hand, the Chinese government's US dollar foreign exchange income is estimated to be between US$125 million and US$185 million (from exports, remittances from overseas Chinese, expenses of foreign governments and charitable organizations, and the sale of surplus property). According to the document, as of January 1 this year, the Chinese government held US$234 million in US currency or gold and US$40 million in British pounds, totaling US$274 million. In addition, China also holds silver worth US$30 million. It is estimated that private holdings of gold, foreign exchange, and long-term assets are at least US$500 million. According to statistics from the State Department, the United States has assisted China in various forms before the victory over Japan, totaling US$1.469.4 billion. Since the victory over Japan, aid to China has reached US$1.409 billion. On the other hand, since the victory over Japan, the Chinese government has spent more than US$700 million in foreign exchange. According to the ten-point reform plan for finance and economy announced by our Prime Minister Zhang Qun on January 28, it is also one of the appendices to the document.

### US Further Reduces Gasoline Exports

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th, United Press] US Secretary of Commerce Harriman has reduced the total amount of gasoline product exports for January, February and March of this year for the second time by 559,000 barrels. The previous reduction was on January 30, which reduced the originally scheduled total of 11.85 million barrels by 24%. In the revised list of amounts to be exported to the Far East (including China), the amount to be exported to China is 60,000 barrels of aviation motor fuel, 50,000 barrels of other motor fuel, 85,000 barrels of kerosene, and 100,000 barrels of gasoline and fuel oil.

### The National Assembly's Concession Issue

(Continued from Page One) The current issue has reached its final stage. The Minshe (Democratic Socialist) and Youth parties have issued statements expressing their attitudes. The Youth Party spokesman made three points: A, it is not a request for concessions, but a request to enforce national laws and party discipline; B, national laws should support party discipline, otherwise political parties will become ineffective; C, the Youth Party is not particularly interested in whether or not it is elected, but this is to fulfill its responsibility to the country. At the appropriate time, the Youth Party will issue a solemn statement to express its attitude. Yang Junming, a spokesman for the Democratic Socialist Party, said that it was regrettable that the Kuomintang could not truly implement cooperation. If the Kuomintang does not consider changing its methods, the Democratic Socialist Party will not participate in the National Assembly and Legislative Yuan after the implementation of the constitution. Its formal written document will be announced after being approved by the party's Central Standing Committee. According to Hong Lanyou, the government is very willing to fulfill its political promises and implement concessions, but concessions should be based on a legal basis.

[Our Nanchang dispatch dated 21st] The Kuomintang-nominated and regularly-elected National Assembly representatives from Jiangxi Province, who should make concessions to friendly parties, include nine counties: Jiujiang, Ganxian, Yichun, Dingnan, Xinyu, Linchuan, Jishui, Yiyang, and Yihuang. The issues in Dingnan and Xinyu have been resolved, and negotiations are underway for the others.

### The Seventh Pacification Zone Conference

County Magistrates Emphasize Winning Back Popular Support

[Our Huaiyin dispatch dated 21st] It is reported that if there are no special obstacles, the Seventh Pacification Zone Conference can be closed on the 22nd. Commander Zhang Xuezhong took the opportunity of a luncheon on the 21st to gather civil and military officers participating in the conference for a meal, and reviewed the current situation in northern Jiangsu in detail. During the Pacification Conference on the morning of the 20th, the work reports of various units were presented. The county magistrates all spoke earnestly. Chen Tianqiu, the magistrate of Huaiyin County, particularly emphasized the strict discipline of the army and winning back popular support. [Another dispatch] The Xuhai Highway is clear and unobstructed.

### Communist Bandits in Jiaodong Forcibly Collect Civilian Grain to Transport to the Northeast in Exchange for Military Supplies

"Public Grain" Has Been Collected Up to September

[Our Jinan dispatch dated 21st] In the past two weeks, bandits in Jiaodong have been actively and forcibly collecting civilian grain. Whenever they obtain it, they load it onto sailboats in the southeast of Penglai and the northwest of Fushan, and secretly transport it to the Northeast to exchange for military supplies from a certain party. According to people from the bandit area, the bandits have already pre-collected this year's public grain up to September. The bandits feel very difficult about manpower and food, so they do not hesitate to drain the pond to catch all the fish, and search for the remaining grain among the people to exchange for military supplies.

### Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi Joint Defense Headquarters Established in Bose

[Our Guilin dispatch dated 21st] The joint defense headquarters of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces, after consultation, decided to establish the headquarters in Bose, with Ling Yaxi as the commander, and Zhou Gan and Teng Song as the deputy commanders.

### Bandit Gang Discovered at the Border Between Xiangtan and Qushan, Repelled

Notorious Bandit Liu Zhicheng Surrenders on the Guangdong-Hunan Border

[Our Changsha dispatch dated 21st] At the border between Xiangtan and Hengshan, a gang of bandits calling themselves the "New Fourth Army" was discovered at the beginning of the lunar year. They had about 30 people and guns, attacked the township office, seized firearms from the police station, and robbed residents. They were pursued and suppressed by the Hunan police brigade, and fled back to the Xianghengshan Yue area. In addition, Liu Zhicheng, a notorious bandit in the Guangdong-Hunan border area, previously responded to the communist bandits and invaded Guidong (county name). This bandit has now surrendered to the Rucheng Self-Defense Headquarters and has been reorganized into the "Rucheng Self-Defense Headquarters Directly Under the Qing Suppression Brigade," with more than a hundred people and guns stationed in the Dongling area.

### Changshu County Government Ordered to Strictly Blockade Ports

Only Fushan and Hupu Permitted to Open

[Our Changshu dispatch dated 21st] The county government has recently received an order from the Jinghu River Defense Headquarters stating that, with the exception of the ports of Fushan and Hupu in the Yutai sub-district, all other ports must be strictly blockaded, and any ships are absolutely prohibited from entering or leaving. Violators will be severely punished, and responsible officers at all levels will also be subject to joint punishment.

### Fujian-Guangdong Joint Defense Negotiations Completed, Tu Sizong Returns to Guangzhou from Fuzhou

[Our Fuzhou dispatch dated 21st] The Fujian-Guangdong joint defense negotiations have been completed. Tu Sizong returned to Guangdong on the 21st. Wang Lufeng, commander of the Southern Fujian Division and commander of the Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xiamen Security Command, also flew to Guangzhou on the same day.

[Our Haikou dispatch dated 21st] The joint defense conference of Qiongshan, Wenchang, Ding'an, Chengmai, Danxian, Wanning, Lehui, Qiongdong, and Linxi counties, convened by the Hainan Suppression Department, opened on the 20th, presided over by Commander Han.

### Various Groups in Beiping Launch Blood Donation for the Wounded and Sick, Sending Shoes to Soldiers

Telegrams to the Nation to Participate in the Grand Event

[Central News Agency, Beiping dispatch dated 21st] Various popular groups in Beiping recently decided to launch a widespread blood donation and shoe-sending campaign under the slogan "Everything for the National Army, Everything for the Front, Donate Blood to the Wounded Soldiers, Send Shoes to the Soldiers," in order to encourage and comfort the loyal and brave troops who are suppressing the rebellion to complete their task. It has been decided that the city will aim for 100,000 CC of blood and 100,000 pairs of military shoes, and will immediately mobilize citizens to take the lead in donating, and will send telegrams to the whole country, urging participation in the grand event. The telegram stated: After eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, we have once again suffered a full-scale rebellion by traitors and bandits. The rehabilitation work cannot be advanced, and the national security is once again threatened. The government is mobilizing to suppress the rebellion and is rising up again to engage in a war to defend the country and safeguard the nation. Since the war zone is vast, there will be many casualties. During the Spring Festival this year, all sectors of Beiping went to the front line and various hospitals to comfort the troops, and personally witnessed the morale, deeply believing that victory can be grasped. However, the wounded soldiers need blood transfusions, and the front line lacks cloth shoes. Considering that the soldiers suppressing the rebellion are truly national revolutionary soldiers who are protecting the country's territorial sovereignty, it is not only our compatriots in the rear's inescapable duty to provide money and effort to supply the front, but also our unswerving duty. After deliberation by all sectors of the city, we will transfuse 100,000 CC of blood to the wounded soldiers in Beiping and donate 100,000 pairs of military shoes to the soldiers on the front line. The compatriots in this city should take the lead in practicing this, and immediately formulate a plan to effectively promote it. We hope that all sectors of the country, regardless of age or location, will rise up together and launch two major campaigns of blood donation and shoe donation in their respective localities, so that the wounded and sick officers and soldiers can fulfill their wish to return to the front line, and the soldiers on the front line can increase their courage. With the cooperation of the military and civilians, we can complete the task of suppressing the rebellion.

### Pacification Conference Opens in Jinquyan District of Eastern Zhejiang

Shen Honglie Went to Qu County Yesterday to Preside Over

[Our Hangzhou dispatch dated 21st] After the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the security along the line has become increasingly serious. Communist bandits are lurking, not only harassing the local area, but also attempting to destroy traffic. Chairman Shen made a special trip to Jiahu, and after completing the key tasks of the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, he went to Qu County via Jinhua this morning with Ruan Yicheng, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Zhu Mingtao, Director of the Police and Security Department, and Staff Officer Wang of the Military Officer District. Tomorrow, he will convene a pacification conference with the magistrates, police chiefs, and military leaders of the eighteen counties in the Jinquyan District to discuss measures to stabilize the locality, ensure traffic, and eliminate hidden bandits. After the two-day meeting, he will inspect the defense and return to the province.

[Our Qu County dispatch dated 21st] Chairman Shen of Zhejiang Province and his party arrived in Qu County at 3:35 pm on the 21st. They first convened a meeting with the county magistrates that evening. The pacification conference will be held on the morning of the 22nd, and they will leave Qu County on the evening of the 23rd, and travel to Yiwu, Dongyang, Yongkang, Jinhua, Lanxi, Shouchang, Chun'an, Jiande, Tonglu, Xindeng, and Fuyang for inspection. It is expected that they will return to Hangzhou on the evening of the 28th.

### Anlu County Magistrate of Hubei Province Dies in the Line of Duty, Wan Yaohuang Allocates Funds for Consolation

[Our Hankou dispatch dated 21st] Hu Shouqian, the magistrate of Anlu County, led his team to bravely resist when communist bandits invaded the county seat on the 18th, determined to coexist with the city. However, he was outnumbered and seriously injured, and then resolutely committed suicide to become a martyr. Chairman Wan Yaohuang was deeply saddened by the news. In addition to allocating 100 million yuan to comfort the bereaved family, he also made proper arrangements for the funeral to comfort the loyal and courageous.

### Minister Li Weiguo Speaks on International Issues, the International Outstanding Issues Are the Treaty of Peace with Germany, and the Treaty with Japan is Relatively Simple

[Central News Agency, Nanjing dispatch dated 21st] Minister Li Weiguo of the Central Propaganda Department gave a lecture on "International Issues" at the invitation of the Cold Holiday Lecture Meeting for faculty and staff of secondary and higher schools, jointly organized by the Chinese Education Society and the Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau, in the auditorium of Jinling University on the morning of the 21st. Li believes that the outstanding issues that need to be resolved urgently in the current international community are the peace treaty with Germany, and the opinions of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union have not yet been consistent. In terms of compensation, Britain, the United States, and France all advocate preserving a portion of Germany's remaining means of production, so as to maintain the German people's minimum standard of living and gradually increase production to compensate the Allied countries, while the Soviet Union has not considered the consequences of this matter, and insists that the remaining means of production must be completely transferred for compensation. France has been invaded by Germany three times in seventy years and does not want to see Germany have a dictatorial centralized government again, while the Soviet Union has expressed its willingness to fully support the establishment of a centralized German government. The reason for this is that the Soviet Union has cultivated the German Communist Party into the most powerful political party in the past few years. Once Germany is out of Allied control, the Communist Party will be able to control the entire Germany. In addition, the border issue is also an obstacle to the signing of the peace treaty. After the Soviet Union seized the swampy area in eastern Poland, it allocated the area east of the Oder River in Germany to Poland as compensation. Of course, the latter has rich forest resources and an industrial base, but the residents are all Germans, and their living habits, traditional culture are completely different from those of the Poles, while the residents of the swampy area are all Poles, so they have lost their motherland. As for the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, Li believes that it is simpler than the German peace treaty, but the voting method has become a major dispute. The Soviet Union advocates that the discussion should be held by China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, while Britain says that the discussion should be held by the Far East Commission, which is composed of eleven countries, and a two-thirds majority would have the right to vote. We must know that the Philippines, Canada, Australia, and other countries among these eleven countries are actually the same as Britain and the United States, so it is difficult to expect the opinions of China and the Soviet Union to be valued, because they can only occupy two votes.

Afterwards, Li also commented on international economic issues and international cultural issues, and emphasized that communist culture violates human nature, and that building the ideological foundation of Marx on the philosophy of hatred is too unwise.

### Beiping Executive Yuan Convenes Meeting to Discuss Northern Economic Issues

Heard that a Proposal to Establish a Branch of the National Economic Council Was Made

[Our Beiping dispatch dated 21st] The Beiping Executive Yuan convened a meeting at 3 pm this afternoon to discuss northern economic issues. It was chaired by Li Zongren, and Fu Zuoyi, Chu Xichun, Wang Chongzhi, representative of the Kai Mining Company, and representatives of the Tianjin China Textile and Changlu Customs Bureau participated. The content of the discussion was said to be a proposal to establish a North China branch of the National Economic Council, and to levy special defense donations on coal, salt, and cloth.

### He Yushu Arrives in Suzhou to Instruct to Suppress Grain Prices

[Our Suzhou dispatch dated 21st] He Yushu, director of the Suzhou Provincial Department of Field Grain, arrived in Suzhou this afternoon to inspect grain administration, and met with County Magistrate Wang to instruct him on how to deal with the grain issue. When the reporter visited and asked about measures to suppress grain prices, he said: The current rise in grain prices is mostly due to human factors, so the county government has been ordered to persuade grain merchants to sell their stored grain. If the stocks are insufficient, the government can sell the grain allocated for tax purposes. At the same time, it is also planned to ask the Ministry of Food to allocate a large batch of rice for distribution and sale, so that grain prices will no longer rise, in order to reassure the people.

### Rice Prices Continue to Rise in Wuxi and Changshu

[Our Wuxi dispatch dated 21st] In recent days, the money market has been loose, and prices have risen like runaway horses, skyrocketing. White japonica rice is 2.31 million, Yangxian rice is 2.3 million, Yuan rice is 2.18 million, Xian rice is 960,000, Yuan rice is 1.014 million, wheat is 2.8 million, flour is 1.075 million, soybean oil is 5.1 million, and cotton yarn is 54.25 million.

[Our Changshu dispatch dated 21st] Rice prices here soared again on the 21st. White japonica rice was traded on the black market for 2.5 million yuan. Market transactions are still at a standstill. The county government has decided to take emergency countermeasures to try to suppress the price and maintain the people's food supply.

[Our Fuzhou dispatch dated 21st] Rice prices in Rong (Fuzhou) have risen again. Today, each dan is sold for 2.55 million, and flour is also high.

[Our Jinan dispatch dated 21st] After the Spring Festival in Jinan, due to the loose money market, the prices of most goods have risen across the board. Top-grade flour has reached 1.2 million per bag, 20-count spider yarn is 56 million per piece, and the black market price of gold has also risen to 16.8 million per tael.

### Chairmen of Various Industries in Wuxi Resign One After Another

[Our Wuxi dispatch dated 21st] Sixty to seventy chairmen of various trade associations in the county resigned from their positions in the associations today due to the difficult business operations of their respective industries and the heavy taxes, making it difficult to cope with the situation. They also submitted reports to the county government and the Chamber of Commerce for filing.

### Statement by Private School Principals in Guangzhou

[Our Guangzhou dispatch dated 21st] It is rumored that the recent rise in Hong Kong dollars in Guangzhou was caused by private schools using all their tuition fees to purchase Hong Kong dollars, which stimulated the market and led to a crazy rise. The principals of various private schools have issued a statement stating that the private schools only have 20,000 students, and the total tuition revenue is only 100 billion. Even if foreign currency is purchased, the amount is not large enough to stimulate the market. In addition, the private schools have rejected the Guangzhou Education Bureau's suggestion to deposit the fees into the bank, believing that this move is also difficult in practice.

### Burhan Arrives in Taiwan for Sightseeing

Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe Will Also Go

[Our Taipei dispatch dated 21st] National Government Member Burhan arrived in Taiwan by ship on the 21st. He expressed optimism about the future of Xinjiang. It is said that Xinjiang is very peaceful recently. The vice chairman of Xinjiang Province, Ahhemaitijiang, may return to Dihua from Yining. After Ahhemaitijiang returns, Director Zhang Zhizhong will also fly to Dihua from Lanzhou. He plans to tour Taiwan for half a month. The Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe is also scheduled to come to Taiwan within a week.

### Ancient Artifacts Presented to Japan by Wang Jingwei Will Soon Be Returned to Our Country

[Central News Agency, Tokyo dispatch dated 21st] Eight jade screens, an ivory teapot, and a pair of ivory vases, ancient artifacts of our country that were presented to the Japanese government by Wang Jingwei, the former Nanjing puppet government, will soon be returned to our country. It is said that the jade screens were presented by Wang Jingwei to the Japanese Emperor, and the ivory teapot and vases were presented to the Japanese Empress.

### Yongxing Ship Will Return Home the Day After Tomorrow to Transport Compensation Materials

[Central News Agency, Tokyo dispatch dated 21st] The Chinese cargo ship Yongxing, which is carrying Japanese compensation equipment, has begun loading at the former naval base in Yokosuka. The Chinese delegation here said that the ship (4,700 tons) is the third Chinese ship to transport Japanese compensation goods and is expected to leave Japan and return home on the 24th. The compensation team of the Chinese delegation here said that there are still about 1,000 machines allocated to China waiting to be transported in Yokosuka. The first Chinese cargo ship Haikang, which arrived in Yokosuka on January 13, will arrive in Japan again. It is expected that the Haikang ship will load the remaining compensation goods waiting to be transported in Yokosuka and return home. As of now, China has received 1,052 boxes of machines and tools for the initial compensation under the early allocation and transportation plan. The Yongxing ship is almost twice as large as the first two cargo ships to arrive in Japan and is expected to transport more compensation equipment back.

### Low Pressure Alert

[Central News Agency, Nanjing dispatch dated 20th] Central Meteorological Observatory News: The center of the low-pressure alert is in Hebei, and the force is growing, resulting in strong winds. The strong winds are currently moving towards the Yellow Sea. There are strong winds and waves along the coast of the Shandong Peninsula and the Jiaodong Peninsula in the Yellow Sea. Ships sailing along the coast north of Hangzhou Bay are asked to pay special attention.

### De'an Station on the Nanxun Railway, Station Equipment Was Destroyed

Due to Soldiers Being Prevented from Carrying Firewood on the Train

[Our Nanchang dispatch dated 21st] The De'an station on the Nanpu Railway was destroyed by the military on the 20th. Because soldiers of a certain unit carried firewood to the station and boarded the express train, they were stopped by the station master. The regimental adjunct and staff of the unit led more than 30 armed soldiers to destroy all the equipment in the station ticket office and burned the unused tickets in the ticket cabinet. Before this incident occurred, the station received a report and immediately asked the county government for assistance. The regimental adjunct, etc., went to the county government and stated that they would not make things difficult for the station master and obtained a certificate from the county government, but the incident still occurred.

### Mineral Deposits in Changping County, Hebei Province, Include Gold, Manganese, and Asbestos

The Mining Bureau Will Suggest Continued Mining After Investigation

[Central News Agency, Beiping dispatch dated 21st] The Hebei Provincial Mining Bureau recently sent personnel to investigate the mineral deposits in Changping. According to a certain technician who returned from the investigation: The county's mineral deposits include gold, manganese, and asbestos. Gold deposits are distributed in Huiling, Fenshui, and Xinzhuang, which are forty to fifty miles north of the county seat. The Fenshui gold deposit is the best, with reserves of approximately 2 million tons. The manganese deposit is forty miles northeast of the county seat, and the quality is also good, with a content of approximately 40% to 50%. The asbestos deposit is in Hezigou and Liushigang, which are fifty miles northwest of the county seat, and the distribution is quite wide. All three types of mineral products were mined by the Japanese during the occupation period and have been suspended after the restoration, which is a pity. It is reported that the bureau will suggest to the provincial government to find ways to continue mining.

### U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Interrogation Focuses on Military Aid to China

[Washington, D.C., U.S. Information Service, 20th] On the 20th, the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee devoted most of its interrogation time to discussing China's military needs. Representative Judd (Republican from Minnesota) urged expanding military aid to China and sending a military advisory delegation to China. Marshall pointed out that during his time in China as President Truman's special envoy, he constantly provided advice to the Chinese government on how to improve its combat forces. He emphasized the importance of providing thorough training before incorporating these troops into combat divisions.

The Secretary of State declared: "There has been no shortage of advice, and it has been constantly and diligently offered—but it has been ignored."

When asked if the aid to China plan was an amendment to the European Recovery Program, Marshall said: "No, this is an important situation that the United States must face, while the European Recovery Program is a complete entity in itself. When considering the European Recovery Program, we are dealing with one situation; when considering aid to China, we are dealing with an entirely different situation."

Marshall stated: European countries have a solid foundation to build upon, but the situation in China is extremely chaotic, and no one can predict the future.

Republican Representative Mente stated: The State Department should have a "strong" foreign policy to complement aid to China and aid to Europe. The Secretary of State supported this view, stating: The primary goal of the State Department is "certain individual freedoms."

He continued: "I do not think we are standing still; I think we are moving forward."

Smith asked: Does the Secretary of State believe that the committee should study Wedemeyer's report on aid to China? The Secretary of State answered, "No." He did not wish to express an opinion on the suggestion that Allied Supreme Commander in Japan, General MacArthur, be recalled from Tokyo to testify before the committee. Some committee members seemed to support this proposal. When asked what reforms he thought the Chinese National Government should implement, Marshall answered: He believed that the foundation of the Chinese government must be broadened and not limited to a small group. "In particular, I believe the National Government should take action on the land situation and the farmers' problems, creating a feeling among the lower classes that the government is not neglecting them or their problems."

He stated: China's military hardware is far less important than the quality of leadership and the morale of the people.

Republican Representative Lodge asked: Should a new conference be held regarding the issue of Japanese reparations? The Secretary of State stated: The current agreement should be reconsidered because it may hinder the resolution of the entire issue.

The Secretary of State pointed out that the situation in China had caused concern at various times. In August 1946, he suggested that the U.S. Export-Import Bank study the possibility of development loans to China. Marshall added: "But at that time, the situation in China was such that the bank felt it could not provide loans."

Representative Kee (Democrat from West Virginia) inquired whether the aid currently under consideration could "reach the Chinese people, given that this aid is intended for the Chinese people." The Secretary of State replied: "He believes it can be achieved; we can reasonably hope that the plan will be implemented and that the goods can reach the people for whom they are intended."

The Secretary of State stated: Many of the past delays in supplying weapons to the Chinese government were due to the Chinese authorities' delay in making various arrangements.

Representative Vorys (Republican from Ohio) pointed out that Congress has a feeling that any action on China may be either too early or too late.

Marshall replied: "In my view, certain fundamental work must be done before our aid can be effective. In this sense, aid is still too early. On the other hand, the situation there is rapidly deteriorating, and we must consider the possibility that we cannot achieve anything without wasting funds." The Secretary of State stated: There are many things the Chinese government could do that it has not done, namely, politically satisfying the people, and militarily not only responding to the advice of our senior military strategists but also responding to the advice of their own senior officers. Vorys asked whether the situations in Greece and China could be equated. Marshall replied: The situations are very different. He explained that in China, "we have an army that has been fighting the government for quite some time. In Greece, we have an aggressive force supported by neighboring countries. There is no evidence that the communist army is receiving aid from outside China."

The Secretary of State agreed with Representative Smith (Republican from Wisconsin) that the situation in China could endanger U.S. national security. Marshall stated: The State Department hopes that a stable China can be established, but this involves military, political, and economic factors that still need to be formed.

Marshall disagreed with Smith's opinion that the Chinese Northeast had been acquired by the Communists. He stated: He did not want to create the impression that the National Government forces would suddenly reverse the situation against the Communist forces, but he indicated that he did not believe the situation in the Northeast was as critical as some people portrayed.

### Democratic Party Gains Support of Socialist Party, Ashida Elected Japanese Prime Minister, Begins Forming Center-Left Coalition Cabinet, Socialist Party Expected to Retain Significant Power in New Cabinet

[Tokyo, United Press, 21st] Hitoshi Ashida, President of the conservative Democratic Party of Japan, was elected Japan's fifth Prime Minister since the war on the afternoon of the 21st. Ashida stated that he plans to form a center-left coalition cabinet on the 23rd. Ashida, 60 years old, previously served as Foreign Minister in the Katayama cabinet. It is expected that MacArthur will approve of his leadership. Ashida was elected with 216 votes in the 421-seat House of Representatives. Outgoing Prime Minister Tetsu Katayama announced that he would not run, and his Social Democratic Party ultimately switched to supporting Ashida. Ashida's political rival, former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida of the Liberal Party, received 180 votes. Katayama received eight votes, Communist Party leader Tokuda received three votes, and there were 14 invalid votes. In two rounds of voting in the House of Councillors, Yoshida held an advantage, but did not reach the required majority. However, the vote in the House of Representatives is decisive, so it is expected that the House of Councillors will take unified action on the evening of the 21st or the 22nd. Ashida issued a statement afterward, saying that he would invite leaders of various parties on the 23rd to discuss policy agreements. He does not intend to visit the Emperor for the investiture ceremony until the cabinet is organized. Because Ashida is heavily dependent on the Social Democratic Party, the new cabinet is expected to be largely the same as the previous cabinet. Political observers have already predicted that key economic positions have been decided to be filled by the Social Democratic Party. Because the left-wing members of the Social Democratic Party unexpectedly supported Ashida, it is rumored that left-wing Social Democrat Kato will be appointed Minister of Labor. If this is the case, then the new cabinet will be almost entirely the same as the previous cabinet, with the Social Democratic Party holding significant power, the only difference being that the Prime Minister is a member of the Democratic Party. Ashida was a classmate of Katayama's when he studied at the Imperial Hosei University. Before the war, he was the president of the English-language "Japan Times and Mail." He is fluent in English and French, which Katayama himself admits he cannot match. Ashida also served as a Kyoto district councilor and was stationed in Turkey and Belgium. It is said that the Allied Headquarters has a very good impression of him. When Ashida was Foreign Minister, he caused a great uproar when he announced that he hoped Okinawa and neighboring Japanese islands could be returned to Japan when the peace conference was convened. However, he later claimed that this was a misunderstanding of the reports. Ashida has recently been criticized by political opponents, who say that he wrote articles for the Japan Times and Mail before the war advocating aggression, and should therefore be purged. It is generally believed that the new cabinet will face a difficult future. Because of inflation, lack of resources, and other economic problems, Katayama resigned, and Ashida will be very hesitant.

[Tokyo, New Asia News Agency, 21st] After Democratic Party President Ashida was nominated as the next Prime Minister in the House of Representatives, he met with the press for the first time and said: "I am very grateful to have been elected Prime Minister of the Cabinet at today's plenary session of the House of Representatives, despite my limited abilities. I will serve the country with utmost sincerity. I plan to visit the leaders of various parties next week to ask for their cooperation and discuss policies. As for the specific date next week, it has not yet been decided. I am not willing to say much about my opinions for the time being, but I hope to overcome the current crisis with the cooperation and assistance of the people."

[Tokyo, New Asia News Agency, 21st] House of Representatives Speaker Matsuoka and House of Councillors Vice-Speaker entered the Imperial Palace tonight on behalf of the Diet to report to the Emperor that Ashida had been nominated as the next Prime Minister of the Cabinet and notified both houses of the Diet in writing. Therefore, Ashida has been confirmed as Prime Minister. However, Ashida's investiture ceremony with the Emperor is scheduled to be held at the same time as the certification ceremony after the ministers have been decided. Starting next week, Prime Minister Ashida will use the Democratic Party headquarters as the cabinet formation headquarters. It is expected that the four-party coalition will be the fundamental policy. A policy agreement meeting will be held with the leaders of the Liberal, Socialist, and Cooperative parties to first seek policy consensus and then select cabinet members.

### Pacific Allies Unanimously Oppose U.S. Rebuilding Japanese Economy, Deeply Fear Japan's Resurgent Aggression Threatening Peace

[Washington, United Press, 20th] The U.S. plan to rebuild the Japanese economy and save the country from bankruptcy has strained the postwar common front of the Allied countries in the Pacific. The United States hopes that Japanese commerce will recover and become self-sufficient. Other Allied countries do not agree. Some countries believe that if Japan becomes strong again in the world market, it will threaten the economies of other countries in the Pacific. Others believe that after Japan re-industrializes, it will embark on a path of militarism again, endangering world peace. The Philippines and Australia hold this view, and China is also believed to hold this view.

By mid-month, Foreign Minister Wang had issued a statement with views closer to those of the United States. But other sectors of the Chinese government and public refused to accept this new stance. In the Southwest Pacific, there is also unease about the United States protecting Japan. The Malayan Federation, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies have not forgotten the pain of the Japanese military's iron heel. The newly independent Burma and the British dominions of Pakistan and India can be said to share the same views. The opinions of all these countries are increasingly at odds with the U.S. financial aid to Japan. The report from Tokyo that the United States plans to implement a one billion dollar aid to Japan plan within four years has not been fully confirmed here, but it is possible. Since the United States occupied Japan, it has spent more than 300 million dollars each year, and commercial loans are just beginning. The U.S. Department of the Army is opening up other sources of funding for Japan. Congress is considering a 150 million dollar U.S. cotton shipping bill to Japan. The Federal Supply Bureau will spend 285 million dollars in Japan this year, and it seems that it will spend 360 million dollars next year. The Department of the Army also hopes to establish barter arrangements.

[Tokyo, United Press, 21st] It is reported that, according to the policy currently being drafted, the Japanese government needs foreign loans and investment, but hopes to avoid "speculative" money. The basic policy for dealing with this matter is being studied by the Trade and Foreign Loan Committee of the Japanese Economic Stabilization Board. Allied businessmen and potential investors in Japan are closely watching the final development of this matter. According to Japanese sources, a "concrete policy" will be adopted soon, with the following key points: (1) Speculative investment should be rejected; (2) Investment should be accompanied by the import of raw materials; (3) The import of raw materials unrelated to economic recovery should be restricted; (4) Religious, cultural, tourism, and research projects should be encouraged as much as possible. Japanese government officials believe that foreign exchange transactions will be temporarily controlled, as commerce and loans are still under control. It is believed that this matter will change after the peace treaty with Japan is signed. The current controls are in fact stipulated by the Allied forces. The Japanese are now studying how to control foreign exchange if the Japanese government orders it to do so.

### France Responds to Soviet Protest Regarding German Conference

[Paris, Agence France-Presse, 20th] The French government sent a response today to the Soviet Union's protest against the meeting of France, the United States, and the United Kingdom in London, stating that France did not sign the Potsdam Agreement and is therefore not bound by this agreement. The only document France has signed is to urge countries related to the German problem to consult. The French government's consistent position is that the four governments should maintain a consistent attitude. Now that the London Conference has failed, the French government has no choice but to consult with the United Kingdom and the United States to find a solution to this major problem of European recovery.

### Truman Travels

[Washington, Central News Agency, 20th] President Truman left here this morning on a special plane for a trip to the U.S. base in the Caribbean Sea. His travel destinations include Floria, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Cuba. He is scheduled to return to Washington on March 5.

### Saar Economic Integration into France, Agreement Formed by the United Kingdom, United States and France, France Agrees to Reduce Reparations Demands from Germany

[Berlin, Reuters, 20th] The U.S. military government announced that experts from the United Kingdom, France, and the United States have reached an agreement in Berlin on the three major issues of the Saar's integration into the French economic system, namely coal, France's share of reparations, and trade between the Saar and the British and American zones. The agreement stipulates that from April 1, trade between the Saar and West Germany will be regarded as foreign trade, but the Saar's supply of coal to Germany will still be paid in Marks as in the past.

Business relations between the French occupation zone and the British and American zones have been reviewed, and the current trade agreement will be revised in accordance with the new situation. Trade in 1948 will still be based on the Mark, but a joint committee will be established to constantly monitor the development of trade. A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry said that France, in view of the new deployment regarding the Saar, has agreed to reduce France's reparations demands from Germany, which were originally set at 70 million Marks based on the 1938 Mark exchange rate. When asked whether the Saar Agreement established in Berlin was a precursor to the French zone joining the British-American merger zone, the spokesman said that he did not believe that the three zones would be merged as a result.

### Greek Parliament Trusts Government

[Athens, United Press, 20th] The Greek Parliament, after discussing the government's operations against the guerrillas for five days, voted today, with 190 votes against 90 votes, to trust the coalition government.

### Clay Alleges Soviet Zone Maintains German War Potential

[Berlin, United Press, 20th] General Clay told the Allied Control Council for Germany that he had heard many rumors indicating that the Soviet Union was still maintaining much of Germany's war potential. He said: "I dare not say that the rumors we have heard are indeed facts. It is said that there are still shipyards in Rostock and other places building warships, Saxony is mining uranium, and there are orders requiring factories in the U.S. zone to manufacture precision instruments for the Soviet zone. Although this is only a rumor, this rumor is also sufficient to hinder the harmony of the four countries on the demilitarization of Germany."

### Joint Proposal by the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to Conclude Anti-Aggression Pact, Memorandum Submitted to the British and French Governments

[The Hague, Reuters, 20th] The Dutch news agency said: According to well-informed sources, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have jointly submitted a memorandum to the United Kingdom and France on the Bevin Western European alliance plan, suggesting the conclusion of a mutual assistance treaty against aggression. The memorandum was personally delivered by Belgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Spaak to the British chargé d'affaires and the French ambassador to Belgium. In the memorandum, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg also rejected the British and French proposal to extend the Dunkirk Treaty between the United Kingdom and France to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, pointing out that this action is not sufficient to guarantee full protection. The anti-aggression mutual assistance treaty proposed by the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg is similar in nature to the Pan-American Mutual Assistance Treaty signed in Brazil last year. The treaty stipulates that if one or more of the signatory countries is subjected to aggression, the other signatory countries must provide each other with military, political, and economic assistance.

### International Diplomatic War in Europe

— By Our European Correspondent Zhongxi

Since the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in London last winter ended in discord without any results, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall returned to Washington and immediately urged Congress to promptly pass his European Recovery Program without any reduction. British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced in January that he would abandon the Labour Party's long-standing foreign policy of bridging the gap between the United States and the Soviet Union and resolutely proposed the Western European alliance plan. After French Foreign Minister Bidault returned to France, he helped the government rectify its internal affairs and ordered all foreign suspects who incited the French general strike to be deported. After Molotov returned to the Soviet Union, in addition to proposing a reduction in reparations demands from Austria, seemingly intending to reopen negotiations with the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, he recently instructed the Soviet Commander to publicly criticize the U.S. for mistreating Soviet soldiers at the meeting of the Allied Control Council in Berlin. At the same time, he also submitted a barrage of protest letters to the U.S. Department of State. The first said that the United States should not use the Mellaha Air Base in Libya; the second said that the U.S. Navy should not stay in Italian ports, pointing out that this act violated the treaty with Italy; the third said that the U.S. Air Force should not hover over Soviet ships in the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea to conduct reconnaissance; and the fourth said that U.S. telecommunications personnel should not assist the Iranian government in building the northern border defense. The U.S. has refuted all Soviet protests one by one, denying any improper behavior.

All of the above tells us that the gap between Eastern and Western countries is widening, and the division is becoming more apparent.

According to the reporter's observation, the Soviet Union's strategy is to strive for victory without war, using methods such as undermining from below and direct attack in tandem. Its purpose is of course to compete with the United States for hegemony. The Soviet Union's protest has the realistic effect of preemptively striking, indicating that the Soviet Union is not afraid of the United States, but in reality, its true effect is to create a sense of shared hatred of the United States among the Soviet people, cultivating a future backing for the Soviet military's actions. From the point of cursing America and protesting America, it can be said that peace between the United States and the Soviet Union can still be temporarily secured, but it cannot be denied that both sides are preparing for war, and are therefore one step closer to war.

Speaking of the Western European alliance, it was first proposed by former British Prime Minister Churchill. After the British Labour Party came to power, it was unwilling to adopt Churchill's policy. Even now, the British Labour Party still opposes the Western European federal movement led by Churchill. But after the failure of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference last winter, forced by reality, the British Labour Party Foreign Minister had no choice but to adopt this strategy due to the trend of the times. Recently, British Minister of State McNeil personally went to Brussels to lobby the foreign ministers of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, hoping that all countries would voluntarily sacrifice their rights and interests to join this alliance, so as not to be enslaved by any totalitarian country again. It is heard that Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have expressed their support for Bevin's proposal, but still hold a reserved attitude, requesting that the United Kingdom and France first show the detailed content of the plan, and at the same time hope that the three countries can have a say in the British and French-controlled parts of West Germany. On the northern front, Sweden has formally stated that it cannot join, but is willing to continue to maintain neutrality. Denmark also wants to follow Sweden's position, expressing detachment. Switzerland has not expressed anything, and may still maintain neutrality. If the Communist Party in Italy cannot gain momentum, it is mostly hoped that it will join. Everything will still depend on the degree of cooperation between the United Kingdom and France as a prerequisite for success. The number of countries currently conducting the Western European alliance and those accepting the Marshall European Recovery Program is in a ratio of one to three. It is estimated that only five or six countries will join the Western European alliance, while sixteen countries have accepted the Marshall European Recovery Program. It is obvious that the political combination among Western European countries will be ten to a hundred times more difficult than their economic cooperation, and even if Foreign Minister Bevin's Western European alliance plan can be promoted, its progress will inevitably be extremely slow. It is still doubtful whether it can truly achieve the goal of preventing the Soviet Union from advancing westward, because the languages and traditions of Western European countries are different from each other. It is not easy to integrate them immediately. However, judging from their past history, although it is not easy for them to share happiness, they are often able to share difficulties, and their spirit of independence is extremely strong, so even if a strong country can quickly annex them, it is also very difficult to digest them. (February 7, 1948)

### California Drought

### Communist Party Attempts to Control Regime; Sudden Political Turmoil Erupts in Czechoslovakia; Eight Non-Communist Cabinet Members Submit Resignations

[Prague, Reuters, 20th] Eight non-Communist cabinet members of the Czech coalition government resigned tonight, and the dissolution of the Czech Constituent Assembly and the re-election of a new parliament are expected. Prime Minister Gottwald (Communist) today visited President Beneš and submitted the resignation of the entire cabinet. However, Beneš instructed them to continue in office until the general election. Beneš also received non-party Defense Minister Svoboda, Communist Interior Minister Nosek, and People's Party cabinet member Hala.

The Social Democratic Party Executive Committee today passed a resolution demanding the continuation of the coalition cabinet, opposing a non-party government or a majority cabinet of the Communist Party and Social Democratic Party. The Communist Party's declaration regarding the political turmoil stated that the National Socialist Party, the Czech Socialist Party, and the Slovak Democratic Party formed an anti-socialist bloc within the People's Front organization, determined to undermine the cabinet's plans and achievements, hoping that the socialist parties would support the People's Front, save the Gottwald cabinet, and maintain friendship with other Slavic countries. The first to resign today were Czech Socialist Party cabinet members Deputy Prime Minister Dinger, Justice Minister Tedina, and another cabinet member, Stransky. The three People's Party cabinet members, Deputy Prime Minister Slameček, Minister of Posts and Telegraphs Hala, and Minister of Health Prochazka, followed suit. Then, the two Slovak Democratic Party cabinet members, Deputy Prime Minister Kožala and Minister of Transportation Bido, also submitted their resignations to Gottwald. The cause of this cabinet crisis is that the Czech Socialist Party, National Socialist Party, and People's Party accused Communist Interior Minister Nosek of defying cabinet decisions and "reddening" the Ministry of Interior, especially key positions in the police department.

Czech Mass Rally Endorses Communist Prime Minister

[Prague, Agence France-Presse, 21st] Czech Prime Minister Gottwald declared today at a Communist Party-led mass rally, "Reactionary elements at home and abroad are plotting to turn our country into a base for foreign secret agents to carry out conspiracies harmful to the republic and against the Soviet Union." Gottwald continued, "We are determined never to hand over police power to reactionary elements," and called on Czechs and Slavs to "exercise strict vigilance to curb any conspiracy by reactionary elements." Subsequently, the mass rally enthusiastically passed a resolution stating, "We strongly demand that President Beneš accept the resignations of the three-party cabinet members. We only need a cabinet led by Gottwald and do not need cabinet members from the reactionary faction." According to members of parliament, according to constitutional provisions, the president has the right to refuse the resignation of cabinet members, order the cabinet to continue to exercise its powers, and may order a general election of members of parliament within six weeks without the need for an election campaign. It is not yet known what President Beneš will decide.

Communist Interior Minister Announces Discovery of Reactionary Conspiracy

[London, Reuters, 20th] Prague Radio reported that Czech Interior Minister Nosek and Defense Minister Svoboda issued a joint announcement, announcing the discovery of a conspiracy for an armed coup. This conspiracy was uncovered last week during an investigation into Czech Socialist Party newspaper allegations that anti-state elements were serving in the government. The leader was a former subordinate of General Prgucela, who was dismissed from military service in 1945. Their leader, Rielia, had contact with former Polish Expeditionary Force General Anders' subordinates. They colluded with Ukrainians to collect Czech military intelligence and supply it to a foreign country, and distributed reactionary propaganda, preparing for an armed coup. Because this case concerns the safety of important Czech figures and is related to a certain allied country, it is being kept strictly secret.

### US Formally Abandons Panama Base

[Washington, Reuters, 20th] The United States formally abandoned extraterritorial rights to 14 Panama bases leased from Panama in 1942 on the 20th.

### Austrian Peace Treaty Expected; New Soviet Proposals Show Some Concessions; Four-Power Representatives Meeting for Review

[London, Reuters, 20th] A British Foreign Office spokesman announced that when the four-power foreign ministers' representatives met here today to discuss the Austrian peace treaty, the representatives had a significant consensus on the principles of the Austrian peace treaty. Today's meeting was chaired by the British representative, who welcomed the new Soviet proposals regarding German assets in Austria and believed that these Soviet and French proposals could be the basis for a satisfactory solution. He also solemnly stated, "If an agreement is not reached this time, Austria will not obtain a peace treaty for many years. Our goal is to establish an independent Austria. We must not ignore other points in the treaty, such as borders, reparations, and military clauses." French representative Cherrière stated that the French government's goals are the same as those of Britain and the United States, namely to rebuild a free and independent Austria capable of self-reliance. Soviet representative Koktomov also stated that the Soviet Union agreed with the opinions of other delegations and recognized the importance of reaching a solution to the Austrian problem. Koktomov also said that the new Soviet proposals are more advanced than the Soviet Union's original position on German assets in Austria. The foreign ministers' meeting has agreed that the German assets issue is the main problem to be addressed and should be reviewed before other issues. The meeting then discussed the first two chapters of the Soviet proposal. The first chapter stipulates that the Soviet Union should acquire 25% of the Austrian Danube Shipping Company's property rights and all property rights in countries south of Austria; the second chapter stipulates that Austria must pay the Soviet Union freely convertible currency worth US$200 million within two years.

### Security Council Discusses Indonesian Problem; Jiang Tingfu Proposes Suggestion; Advocates that the Mediation Committee Has the Right to Arbitrate; Representatives of Colonial Countries Express Opposition

[Lake Success, Central News Agency, 20th] The Chinese representative suggested in the Security Council today that the United Nations Netherlands-Indonesia Mediation Committee should have the right to arbitrate disputes between the Netherlands and Indonesia in accordance with its interpretation of the Renville Agreement. This suggestion also stated that the failure of the Linggadjati Agreement was due to the different interpretations of the agreement by the Netherlands and Indonesia. Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu informally requested the Security Council to consider his above suggestions in order to prevent the Renville Agreement from repeating the mistakes of the Linggadjati Agreement. He also suggested authorizing the Mediation Committee to make suggestions to both the Netherlands and Indonesia that they could both accept and to publicize such suggestions. The above suggestions made by the Chinese representative were immediately opposed by colonial countries such as Britain. The Security Council adjourned today after a speech by the Ukrainian representative in support of the Soviet representative and scheduled to debate the Indonesian problem again on the 21st.

Call Me Commander-in-Chief, Not President

After the outbreak of war, our armed forces went to the front lines under the command of the President as Commander-in-Chief, but diplomatic work also became an important factor in the war. Relations with enemy countries had certainly ceased, but relations with allies and neutral countries became more and more complicated, making our work much more burdensome.

In peacetime, the State Department is responsible for handling international relations and also provides advice on the deployment of our country's overseas troops, such as whether our troops stationed in China should be increased or decreased. When the war came, the State Department no longer had any involvement in overseas military operations, as it was now solely under the command of the appropriate military authorities.

Almost immediately after the Pearl Harbor incident, I told my colleagues that from now on, the State Department's task was to contribute to the war effort, expressing the hope that everyone in the State Department would fully cooperate and provide all conveniences to the Army Department, the Navy Department, and all war-related agencies.

It became a habit for me not to allow State Department officials to come to me and say that a certain official in the Army Department or Navy Department had done something wrong. I told them, "Remember, they are responsible for strategy and executing the war. They have the right to our fullest cooperation."

Before the Pearl Harbor incident, I was a member of the military conference, which included the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of Staff, and the Chief of Naval Operations. I participated in every meeting. After the Pearl Harbor incident, I no longer attended meetings related to military matters. This was because the President did not invite me to attend these meetings. I raised this issue with him several times. In my opinion, in many important aspects, the Secretary of State should attend the President's military meetings, especially meetings of a combined military-diplomatic nature, for obvious reasons, because very few large-scale military operations do not involve diplomatic aspects.

I felt that it was a major mistake for the Secretary of State not to attend important military meetings. I often had the opportunity to point out to the President that a certain military development undoubtedly decided in these meetings also had its major diplomatic relations, and I should have been informed at the time.

The President did not take me to the Casablanca, Cairo, or Tehran conferences, which were mainly of a military nature. I also did not participate in the military discussions he held with Prime Minister Churchill in Washington, some of which had a broad impact on the diplomatic side. I said to him, "I am not trying to increase my responsibilities, but I believe the Secretary of State should attend these meetings." I mentioned the British method, which is that Foreign Secretary Eden attends all military meetings. The President's reply was that we have a different system here. I agreed that this was the case. The British cabinet forms the government, and Eden has stronger reasons to attend military meetings under their system than I do under our system, even though the various aspects of diplomacy are also important factors worth considering.

I learned about what happened in the Casablanca, Cairo, and Tehran conferences from sources other than the President. I did not have a special opportunity to ask Mr. Roosevelt about the developments of these meetings, but if I asked him about the issues he discussed, then, with a few exceptions, he would always frankly tell me the most confidential things.

One military matter that I had discussed with the President and his military aides was the location of the second front. I agreed that our main effort should be to cross the English Channel to France. As for where the troops would land and what route the Allied forces would take across the continent in the major military operation to conquer Hitler, I never discussed it with the President or any other senior military officials, although I had learned of the decision that had already been reached. Regarding the atomic bomb, no one told me. Occasionally, someone would give me a vague hint, but I did not press for an answer. I didn't really know about it until it was dropped and announced. In the last few months of its preparation and at the time of its dropping, I was no longer the Secretary of State, so I wouldn't have known anything. Mr. Roosevelt's foresight in deciding to spend two billion dollars to develop the atomic bomb is indeed worthy of praise.

The President continued not to invite me to his military meetings. He loved the military side of the big picture and liked to keep it in his own hands. After the Pearl Harbor incident, he liked to be called Commander-in-Chief more than the title of President. He was happy to use this title. He may have felt that this extremely important position was now more necessary than the President.

At a cabinet dinner, around 1942, I prepared to raise my glass in a toast. Before I stood up to speak, the President asked me:

"Please call me Commander-in-Chief, not President."

When I talked to ambassadors from various countries, especially representatives of our major allies, it was of course impossible not to mention certain military topics. In December 1941, when I had my first conversation with the new Soviet ambassador, Litvinov, I raised a question asking the Soviet Union to allow us to use air bases on Soviet territory in order to bomb Japanese areas. We also discussed the issue of using Soviet ships to transport supplies to Vladivostok, because Japan would obviously not allow American ships to transport them to the Soviet Union.

Litvinov was the former Soviet Foreign Minister, and I had previously conducted preliminary negotiations with him, resulting in the establishment of US-Soviet diplomatic relations in 1933. Three days later, when Litvinov came to see me at my request, he said that his government had informed him that it did not believe it could cooperate with us against Japan at that time. He said that the Soviet Union was engaged in a large-scale war against Germany and could not risk attacking Japan.

I replied that I could understand the Soviet Union's position. I mentioned to him that at the beginning of this year, we had provided the Soviet Union with warnings about Germany's impending attack, and said that I now had the same reliable information, namely that Japan, regardless of the provisions of the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact, had the strictest obligations to Germany, and would attack the Soviet Union and any other country at war with Germany when Hitler requested it. I also said that the plan seemed to be that Japan would attack the United States first, with Germany and Italy joining in, and then, when Germany requested it, Japan would invade the Soviet Union.

Although Stalin had decided not to join us against Japan at that time, I still kept this issue before him for quite some time.

After the outbreak of war, the work of the State Department changed or intensified in many ways.

In order to exchange diplomatic personnel and civilians with the Axis powers, we were also engaged in negotiations, which consumed several months. A few days after the Pearl Harbor incident, while the State Department was holding a meeting on this issue, we received information from a very reliable source that Japanese Ambassador Nomura and his naval attaché had received orders to commit seppuku in the embassy so that the Japanese government could say that we had assassinated them.

If this plan had been realized, we were very worried about how the Japanese officials would treat us. We asked the Swiss minister to immediately go to the Japanese embassy, inform Nomura of the information we had received, and determine his intentions. They talked for a long time, but they could not completely dispel our fears, because Nomura said that the decision was not up to him, but to higher authorities.

### Regulations on Deferred Conscription for National Defense Technical Workers; Cannot Rely Solely on Registration Certificates Issued by the Labor Bureau; City's Conscription of 6,000 May Adopt Lottery System

Regarding the issue of deferred conscription for national defense technical workers, most industry workers believe that holding a technical worker registration certificate issued by the Labor Bureau of the Ministry of Social Affairs is sufficient for deferred conscription. The Ministry of National Defense believes that the scope of eligibility is too broad, and recently issued four restrictions on deferred conscription, which the Ministry of Social Affairs ordered the city's Bureau of Social Affairs to instruct the General Federation of Trade Unions to follow. The four conditions are: (1) Whether the individual's qualifications meet the provisions of Items 1 and 2 of the first article of the scope of application for deferred conscription for specialized technical workers in the national defense industry. (2) Whether the work currently engaged in is within the departments listed in Items 3 to 11 of the same scope, or approved by the Ministry for handling in accordance with the above provisions. (3) Whether the factory or workplace served meets the provisions of Items 12 to 14 of the same scope, has been registered and approved by the authorities, and the number of power facility employees meets the legal requirements. (4) Whether its competent authority, in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 of the application and review methods, has issued a certificate of technical duty or a technician qualification certificate in addition to issuing a list of names to the local regimental district headquarters for certification.

[This newspaper's report] According to a qualified person, this year's conscription in the city may be carried out by lottery in accordance with the law. This can be predicted from the fact that the central government's quota for the city this year is 6,000 people, which is double the number of last year. The person did not explain the reasons for this prediction, only said that citizens have the obligation to serve in the military, and the central government is now actively promoting military service in various places, and the results are satisfactory. Although Shanghai is an industrial and commercial area, with a population of four million, a quota of 6,000 is not a large number, and it can be easily carried out in accordance with the law.

[Another report] The military service meeting scheduled to be held in the city on the 29th will be held by relevant parties who will telegraph to the Director of the Military Service Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, Xu Siping, to come to Shanghai for guidance.

### Spring Festival Condolences to Military Families; Eight Families' Condolence Money Awaits Collection

This time, the Military Service Association held Spring Festival condolences for the families of soldiers enlisted in the city, sending condolence money of 500,000 yuan to each family. Chairman Pan and others personally wrote a couplet, which greatly inspired all the families. However, a portion of the families could not be sent due to relocation of address. There are eight families in the original Jiangwan District, the Gao Lin family, the Xinshi District, the Huang Wang family, the Xincheng District, the Zhang Huang family, the Beizhan District, Qian Yuegao, the Jing'an District, Ruan Shuying, Ma Cuizhi, the North Sichuan Road District, Lu Xunqing, and the Yimiao District, Li Peng. They are currently retained by the Military Service Association, and it is hoped that the families will go to collect them.

### Motion on Measures for Supervising County and City Finances; City Council Sends Telegram to Legislative Yuan Urging Repeal; Lists Reasons Based on Executive Yuan's Reply

The City Council previously received a letter from the City Government, forwarding the Executive Yuan's order regarding the "Measures for County and City Councils to Supervise County and City Finances Before the Completion of Local Autonomy." It believes that these measures conflict with (1) the current City Council Organization Regulations, (2) change the law by order, (3) reduce the powers of local public opinion organs, and (4) violate the spirit of the Constitution. It has telegraphed the Executive Yuan to request that it withdraw its order and explicitly abolish it, and has telegraphed the provincial and municipal councils to respond unanimously. It has successively received telegrams from the Yunnan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Henan, Jiangxi, and Chahar provincial councils expressing their approval and unanimously advocating for its abolition. It has also received a letter from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan in reply. However, the Executive Yuan's reply only makes an abstract response to the first point in the original telegram, and avoids responding to the second, third, and fourth points. The council still believes that it is not satisfactory and difficult to accept.

In order to maintain the spirit of the Constitution and promote the rule of law, the council has, based on the replies from the various departments, weighed the legal principles, listed the reasons, and submitted them to the General Assembly for a public decision, so that the Executive Yuan can be telegraphed again and the national provincial and municipal councils can be telegraphed to unanimously advocate, and at the same time, the Legislative Yuan can be telegraphed separately to pay attention to the legislative procedures, not allowing the administrative institutions to arbitrarily change the law by order, and to urge the central government to withdraw its order and explicitly abolish these measures. The key points of the reasons stated in the case are recorded below:

(1) The Executive Yuan cited the "Outline of County-Level Organizations," but the outline was promulgated as far back as September 1939, and the current City Council Organization Regulations were promulgated in January 1945. According to the legal principle that later laws take precedence over earlier laws, it should undoubtedly follow the rights granted by the current organization regulations. (2) According to the provisions of Articles 2, 3, and 22 of the current organization regulations, such as if they can be implemented effectively, the division of powers between local administrative organs and public opinion organs is detailed and rigorous, and they can be properly used. The section in the reply stating "making appropriate provisions during the transitional period" is really unnecessary. (3) The reply at the end cited Article 5 of the "Program for Ending the Period of Political Tutelage." This article clearly stipulates that the existing public opinion organs shall exercise their original statutory powers, and shall cease to do so on the date of completion of the election or reorganization in accordance with the Constitution. The "statutory powers" set up therein refer to the powers granted by the current organization regulations, which have been formally legislated, and by no means refer to the supervisory measures of the Executive Yuan, which change the law by order. This is even more obvious.

The Shanghai Municipal Election Commission held a closing meeting in the City Government Conference Room at 4:00 PM yesterday. Commissioners Wu Guozhen, Chen Baotai, Wang Lanseng, and other commissioners, and senior officials of the Election Office attended. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Wu Guozhen, and the following three resolutions were made: (1) The Shanghai Municipal Election Office will close on February 28 and will be formally revoked from March 1. (2) All employees transferred from the Election Office will return to their original offices. (3) Employees in the Election Office who have excellent performance will be continued to be employed by the various bureaus and offices.

### Global Tea Supply Fails to Meet Demand; My Country's Export Volume Increased Last Year; Shou Jingwei Encourages Tea Merchants to Seize the Opportunity

My country's tea industry has always occupied an important position in export trade. However, after the war, due to price fluctuations and increasing costs, export prices were hampered by the vast difference between the official exchange rate and the black market, making exports extremely difficult. Nevertheless, the domestic tea industry, in this exceptionally difficult environment, is still striving to support the government's development of foreign sales and earn foreign exchange. In order to understand the situation of my country's tea exports in the 36th year, the Central News Agency reporter specially interviewed Shou Jingwei, chairman of the China Tea Industry Association, who explained the tea export trade of the past year, the world tea market situation, and the prospects for my country's tea industry this year as follows:

Export Trade in the Past Year: The export volume of tea in my country reached as much as 1 million metric tons during its peak period in 1915, at the beginning of the 20th century. It still reached 400,000 metric tons between 1934 and 1938, but in 1946, the export volume was only 69,000 metric tons. The degree of decline in just over 30 years is quite astonishing.

Export Volume: According to the "Monthly Statistics of China's Import and Export Trade" published by the Statistics Section of the General Customs Administration last year, the November issue shows that from January to November, 43,774 metric tons of black tea, 79,240 metric tons of green tea, 687 metric tons of brick tea, and 9,236 metric tons of other teas were exported, totaling 132,937 metric tons. Compared with the 52,627 metric tons exported during the same period in the 35th year, this is an increase of 60 percent, which seems to be a slight improvement.

(A) Export Ports: From January to November of the 35th year, the total export volume was 52,627 metric tons, with Shanghai exporting 37,370 metric tons, Fuzhou 10,037 metric tons, Guangzhou 1,178 metric tons, Taiwan exporting only 175 metric tons, and other ports 3,867 metric tons. In the 36th year, Shanghai's exports totaled 70,106 metric tons, Fuzhou 7,784 metric tons, Guangzhou 6,546 metric tons, and Taiwan's exports increased sharply to 40,863 metric tons. Other ports accounted for 7,638 metric tons. From the above figures, it can be seen that the export volume of inland tea in my country, excluding Taiwan, was 52,452 metric tons from January to November of the 35th year, and 92,074 metric tons in the same period of the 36th year, an increase of 40,000 metric tons. Most of this was old tea, as the exchange rate affected the price of new tea, creating a situation where domestic prices were higher than international market prices, making it difficult to export smoothly. Due to its good production foundation in the past, Taiwan tea has recovered its production more quickly, enjoys a long-standing international reputation, and its quality is standardized and meets market needs. Therefore, last year's export volume, including December, reached 10 million pounds, recovering 50 percent of its pre-war peak.

(B) Export Tea Types: Among the exported teas, black tea accounted for 43,774 metric tons, and green tea 79,240 metric tons. Among green teas, in addition to 12,666 metric tons of Taiwanese Pouchong green tea, 5,173 metric tons of Pearl tea, 1,166 metric tons of Xichun, 1,180 metric tons of Yuqian, and 3,846 metric tons of Mao tea, the remaining 55,209 metric tons consisted mostly of Tunlu eyebrow tea, accounting for 41 percent of the total export volume, which is more than Qihong and Pinglu. Therefore, Tunlu has great potential for development and expansion of exports in the future.

(C) Export Countries: Before the war, my country's annual tea sales to the Soviet Union were 150,000 metric tons of red, green, and brick teas and other teas. North Africa, Morocco, and Algeria annually sold 100,000 metric tons of green tea (mainly Pinglu), and other countries in Europe and America sold more than 100,000 metric tons of red and green teas. In last year's January-November export figures, Hong Kong ranked first with 37,776 metric tons, followed by the United States with 15,569 metric tons, and the United Kingdom third with 6,640 metric tons. Next were Iben and Egypt, each selling 5-6,000 metric tons, and finally Canada and France, each with 1,7-800 metric tons, while the Soviet Union had only 8 metric tons. Although Hong Kong ranked first in the above figures, most of the tea was re-exported to other countries. North Africa, Morocco, and Algeria are not listed in the customs statistics monthly report, presumably included in the "other countries" category. As for the Soviet Union, due to the government repaying debts in US dollars in the 35th year, no barter trade was adopted, and most of the tea was transshipped through India to the Soviet Union. In December of the 36th year, the Central Trust Bureau used tea purchased in the 35th year for barter trade with the Soviet Union, and 30,961 cases have already been traded, totaling more than 2 million pounds, equivalent to more than 9,700 metric tons, including 2,440 metric tons of black tea and 7,260 metric tons of green tea, which will be shipped to the Soviet Union in the coming days.

Overview of World Tea Production: After World War II, major tea-producing countries such as Japan, the Dutch East Indies, Taiwan, and China were affected by the war, with tea factories destroyed, tea gardens abandoned, or converted to grow food crops, resulting in a sharp decline in production, especially in the Dutch East Indies. According to local communications, although a small number of tea factories are currently engaged in restoration activities, production is very low due to a lack of machinery and personnel. Commercially, the Dutch government controls it, with only a few Dutch merchants doing small amounts of buying and selling under government supervision, and the quality of the tea is much lower than pre-war levels. According to the American magazine "Tea & Coffee" No. 90, the Japanese tea industry was indeed severely hit during the war, with production decreasing by nearly 90 percent compared to pre-war levels. However, under the administration of the US military headquarters, the Japanese government established a foreign trade department to handle tea exports. In 1946, 7 million pounds were exported to the United States, and a five-year plan was implemented starting in 1947, adding 7,352 acres of tea gardens each year, with a production capacity of 57,870,400 pounds, which is 50 percent of the pre-war production of 114.407 million pounds, showing a rapid recovery in production.

It is estimated that after the implementation of Japan's five-year plan, tea production can be increased by at least two times. With government assistance and a good foundation, Taiwan's tea production in 1947 has significantly increased compared to 1946. If the government can provide tea merchants with convenience in terms of exports, both export volume and production will not be difficult to restore to pre-war levels.

In addition, India, Ceylon, and British East Africa not only did not decrease but increased due to the government's implementation of procurement policies during the war. For example, India increased from 4.24 million pounds in 1935-39 to 5.62 million pounds, Ceylon increased by about 50 million pounds, and East Africa increased by 7 million pounds. However, it is estimated that the total tea production in 1947-48 will be between 902-906 million pounds, still less than the pre-war 983 million pounds.

Improve Quality, Encourage Exports

Prospects for My Country's Tea: This year, we should earnestly seize the rare opportunity of global tea supply failing to meet demand. At the same time, the Commodity Inspection Bureau should pay special attention to the strict inspection of tea, and tea merchants should also pay special attention to improving the quality of tea. It is especially important to denounce the mixing of inferior tea with high-priced tea. In addition to further actively encouraging local production in Taiwan and coordinating domestic tea for foreign sales, and continuing to provide tea loans, constructive new measures should be taken for foreign exchange adjustments and import linkages. The directors and supervisors of the Tea Association recently held a meeting to discuss this year's tea loan methods, and it is proposed to follow last year's silkworm cocoon loan plan, stipulating that the average price of each metric ton of tea should be based on the standard of exchanging 2.5 to 3 metric tons of rice, and the loan advance should be set at 10 percent. The total loan amount is currently difficult to determine. If the China Farmers Bank can continue to be responsible for the release and guarantee responsibility, the promotion of the national tea industry can be further developed.

### Dunhuang Cultural Relics on Display for the First Time in Xi'an

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an by this Newspaper on the 17th] The name "Dunhuang" is not unfamiliar to us. We have long admired the Buddhist scriptures and statues in the Mogao Grottoes, forty miles away, but it is a pity that it is not easy to see the original works. It is of course not easy to travel far to the Hexi Corridor and cross the desert to make an on-site inspection, and there are not many opportunities to appreciate even reproductions, copies, prints, and photographs. In the past, we have seen some Dunhuang artworks introduced and disseminated by Stein, Pelliot, Zhang Daqian, Zheng Zhenduo, and others. This New Year, the Northwest Cultural Relics Research Office of the National Northwest University in Xi'an held the "Dunhuang Cultural Relics Exhibition" for the first time. The exhibition lasted for twelve days. Despite the overcast skies, snow, deep mud, and bad roads, the number of visitors every day was still so large. Most of the general visitors were able to accept the exhibits, and the effect was far better than that of ordinary personal art exhibitions.

Excavating Caves and Sculpting Buddhas for 1,500 Years

The types of exhibits in this exhibition are quite comprehensive. Although the number of exhibits is not large, they are exquisite, and after reading them, one can have a complete concept. The map of the Hexi Corridor, the panoramic photo of the Mogao Grottoes, and the long scroll of the panoramic view of the Thousand Buddha Temple sketched by Wang Ziyun (the host of the exhibition) at the entrance show the outline and scale of the Mogao Grottoes, giving the audience a bird's-eye view impression first. This Buddhist cave, which was opened 1,500 years ago and preserved to this day, has a history of more than a hundred years older than the Yungang Grottoes in Datong, the Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang, or the Maijishan Grottoes.

The Buddhist scriptures of Dunhuang were originally extremely rich, but after foreign archaeologists took the lead in searching, looting, and stealing them, the important ones have almost disappeared. However, in this exhibition, we can still fortunately see the handwritten and engraved scriptures from around the Tang Dynasty, which are precious even though they are just fragments.

As for the text part, there are also rubbings of engravings, which, in addition to their artistic value, also help us understand the historical facts of the cave.

Sculptures and Statues of Superb Craftsmanship

We really cannot use words to describe the exquisiteness of the Dunhuang stone carvings and statues. Whether it is the overall shape or the details of the face, muscles, and folds of clothing, we use the eyes and standards of modern people to measure and evaluate them, and they are no less than or even surpass the ancient carvings and statues of Greece and Rome.

There are also four small clay Buddhist statues in the exhibition hall, each statue is less than ten centimeters high, and the faces of the Buddhas are no more than half a centimeter at the smallest, but the facial features are lifelike and exquisite, worthy of the title "divine craftsmanship!"

The Largest Murals Are Several Zhang High

There are two types of murals: original photos and reproductions. From the former, we can see the overall arrangement and composition, and from the latter, we can see the approximate original colors. Both are indispensable for appreciation. The largest "Sutra Transformation Picture" is seven meters high in its original size, with hundreds of figures in the picture. The themes of the murals can be roughly divided into several types: one is Buddhist statues and offering statues, both with colorful coloring and monochrome line drawing; one is the story painting of Buddhist scriptures, and there are also quite a few pattern paintings.

Two Styles, Each with Its Own Merits

Whether it is murals or stone carvings, their styles are clearly divided into two types: centered on the Northern Wei and Tang Dynasties respectively. The former includes the Eastern and Western Wei, Northern Zhou, and Northern Qi dynasties, and the latter includes the Sui, Tang, Five Dynasties, and even later Song and Yuan dynasties. According to the explanation of expert Wang Ziyun: "The forms, techniques, and contents of the Wei and Tang dynasties are completely different. The former mostly depicts Buddhist stories, Nirvana pictures, etc. The techniques are only rendering, not emphasizing outlines, the brushstrokes are bold, and the atmosphere is grand. The bold style of the Xianbei people is revealed without reservation, and the sculptures retain the "Gandhara" style, with the influence of Greece and Persia being extremely strong.

"Tang Dynasty works transformed foreign Buddhist art into the inherent form of the East, forming a product of Chinese national temperament. Murals changed from rendering to outlining, colors changed from simple to gorgeous, content changed from simple to complex, and the themes of Buddhas and guests became richer..."

Ceiling Coffers Comparable to Flower Bricks

The pure patterns are mainly flower bricks and ceiling coffer patterns. Flower bricks were used in Tang Dynasty architecture and Buddhist caves. There are more than 20 kinds of patterns in the Mogao Grottoes. Each brick is 30-35 cm square, and the patterns are mostly radial, with the patterns protruding from the brick surface. The ceiling coffer patterns are painted on the ceilings inside the Buddhist caves, with colorful and rich colors, and are the best materials for researchers of patterns. From the style, it seems to be influenced by Persia and Arabia.

In addition, there are some pattern paintings with modern styles.

Namo Avalokitesvara Has a Beard

In addition to its supreme artistic value, Dunhuang cultural relics are also equally important for religion, language, customs, archaeology, costume history, and music history. An image of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva is exhibited in the exhibition hall. It is a man with an "eight"-shaped mustache and a "了"-shaped beautiful beard under his chin! The audience was amazed, but according to the records in the Buddhist scriptures, it is indeed so.

Tanabe Hisao, an authority on Eastern music history, often cites evidence from Dunhuang's musical instrument history. In the products of this exhibition, we saw various musical instruments and their performance and ensemble situations. One corner of the aforementioned "Sutra Transformation Picture" depicts more than thirty performers holding various musical instruments for ensemble. Whether they are blowing, plucking, beating, pulling, or dancing and plucking, they are all available. From this, we can imagine the musical style of the Tang Dynasty. In addition, many of the hairstyles and clothing of women in the murals coincide with modern ones, which is truly incredible. Who would have thought that the glass handbag of "Mademoiselle Modern" and the "Taoist hair bun" of 1948 had already been painted on the walls of Dunhuang a thousand years ago?

### Allied Headquarters and the Government Jointly Seek the Ancient Bell of Hanshan Temple Today

[Central News Agency, Suzhou, 21st] The ancient Tang Dynasty bell of Hanshan Temple in Suzhou, which became famous in later generations due to the Tang poem "Gusu City, Hanshan Temple, the midnight bell rings to the passenger ship," was stolen and transported to Japan during the late Qing Dynasty. Currently, the two bells hanging in the Great Hero Hall and the "Dajue" Bell Tower of the temple are one from Japan as compensation and one newly cast in the 30th year of Guangxu, neither of which are the original.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Pei Yuan, the abbot of Hanshan Temple, submitted a request to the government based on years of documentary evidence to negotiate with Japan to recover the original bell so that this historical relic could be preserved. The case has been ordered by the Allied Headquarters to the Japanese government to investigate its whereabouts and return it to our country. The monks of the temple are collecting relevant photos and records of the bell's shape and weight for reference. Gui Yu, a defendant in the International Military Tribunal, and Yan Ru, a monk studying in Japan, are also assisting in collecting evidence, and it should not be difficult to return the treasure and allow the people of Gusu to hear the sound of the ancient bell of Hanshan Temple again.

The reporter specially visited the temple today and was received by Jue Xin, a guest monk, who said: This temple was originally "Dayin Temple," with the name "Hanshan." It was founded by Pu Ming (an ancient monk). It is rumored that the ancient bell was stolen by Japanese person Ōkuma Shigenobu in collusion with thieves in the early years of the Republic of China and transported to Japan. In fact, it had already been stolen and transported to Japan during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. This is evidenced by the bell inscription written by Ito Hirobumi, a Japanese person, which states: "The Tang bell was transferred to our country, but now its whereabouts are unknown. Yamada Hanshan searched very hard, but could not find it. Therefore, a new bell was cast and sold to be hung. April of the 38th year of Meiji (i.e., the 31st year of Guangxu, 1905 in the Western calendar)," which shows that the original bell was stolen no later than 1905. The bronze bell currently compensated by the Japanese is hung in the Great Hero Hall of Hanshan Temple. As for the bell hanging in the "Dajue" Bell Tower, it is made of iron and was cast by Chen Xiaoshi, the governor of Jiangsu, in the 32nd year of Guangxu (1906). All officials below the governor are inscribed on it, as detailed in Mr. Yu Quyuan's records. The shape and weight of the original bell are clearly recorded in the "Zhi Zhong." The text states: "The bell is smelted with extremely fine and exquisite craftsmanship, and it is uniquely ancient. The strokes are lively and dynamic, and when touched, it has edges. The sound of the bell seems to say: 'Annoyance is coming,'" presumably the new bell compensated by Japan was cast in imitation. Furthermore, the Allied Headquarters ordered the Japanese government to investigate the whereabouts of the ancient bell of Hanshan Temple based on negotiations by our government. The original text of the report submitted by Pei Yuan, the abbot of Hanshan Temple, to the Wuxian County Government in November of the 36th year is as follows:

"This temple originally had an ancient bell from the Tang Dynasty, which was secretly stolen and transported to Japan by Japanese person Ōkuma Shigenobu in the early years. Subsequently, negotiations were conducted, and Ōkuma Shigenobu cast a bell as compensation. His intention was to conceal the ancient bell. At the time, we were forced to accept it, and Ito Hirobumi came forward to help. The new bell was cast and engraved with the admission of theft. At the time, the monks of the temple were deeply concerned about involving international relations and affecting national relations, so they had to vaguely settle the matter. However, many Japanese officials and people excused themselves by saying that the bell was lost and could not be found. Until Mr. Kang Youwei visited the temple and wrote a poem, proving that the original bell was still in Japan. Furthermore, due to the arrogance of the island barbarians, we tolerated it without speaking out, but the desire to return the treasure has never left our hearts for a day. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it was agreed to request the government to negotiate and recover the materials looted by Japan in our country. Therefore, the ancient bell of the temple should not be an exception. We have specially photographed the new bell and copied the inscription on the bell and the rubbings of Mr. Kang Youwei's poem carved in stone, and submitted them together. We reported to the Buddhist Association at all levels and forwarded them to the higher authorities, first negotiating with Japan. It is appropriate to submit a separate report to your government for review and assistance, requesting your government to intensify negotiations in order to achieve the goal of recovering the original bell. Not only will the temple gain a lot of glory, but your government will also create immeasurable merit. We humbly express our opinion, and look forward to your decision. The monks of the temple are extremely sincere and hopeful."

### Notes from Europe (5)

— Li Hanhun

Rugged Road

The policies currently implemented by the Labor Party in Britain are the legacy and modification of this program. The traditional spirit of Britain is to cure itself after problems arise. All nations with self-respect should be like this.

The path currently followed by Britain is a rugged road, as it inherits the fruits of the old civilization on the one hand and cultivates the tender shoots of the new civilization on the other. The traditions of history and geography make Britain stand firm in the middle, moving forward on a rugged road.

At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, other countries were still stagnating in small-scale agricultural production or the agricultural civilization had already broken down and was in the stage of demanding change. Industrial civilization certainly took British civilization a step forward, and at the same time changed the world civilization. This process and results are well known to the people of Britain and the world. But the people of Britain and the world also understand that industrialization has its inevitable drawbacks, and the best way to cure these drawbacks, in the view of the British nation, which has superior geographical and historical conditions and emphasizes practicality, lies in improvement rather than sudden change; in gradual progress rather than leaps. In other words, the bloodless revolution has already reaped great and obvious fruits in the 800 years of British history. Why can't this method be continued to solve all current problems? This is the aspiration of the British and the belief of the British.

The greatest ills produced by industrial civilization are monopoly, inequality, and unemployment. These ills are now being reformed by the British Labor Party. Starting from meeting the basic needs of each individual, a distribution system is stipulated. For example, food is rationed, with one or less than one egg per week, and bread is absent from every meal with a venue, so that the rich cannot indulge in wasteful spending, and ordinary people can also fill their stomachs and alleviate hunger.

This shows that the current British policy is an economic equalization policy. Large enterprises are nationalized, which can eliminate the ills of capitalist monopoly. Various social insurance laws are implemented to provide security and protection for the people of the country, and to reduce and even eliminate unemployment in the country. Increasing production efficiency without extending working hours, and restricting wages, all of these are to negate the old civilization and enlighten the way to the new civilization. From the theory of the past philosophers "seeking the greatest happiness of the greatest number" to the current policy of food rationing and nationalization of large enterprises, the British society is gradually moving into a new stage without bloodshed. Although the road is inevitably rugged, its future is very bright, and people with insight can predict it.

The economic policies currently promoted by the British Labor Party are very similar to the economic policies of Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood in the Chinese Kuomintang. There are many common similarities between China and Britain in terms of history and culture, so the basic theories and programs applicable to the lives of the people are also similar. The problem is that they can thoroughly implement it, while we have not fully realized it. Sun Yat-sen once pointed out that the Three Principles of the People is socialism, the only difference being the method. If there is a path to social revolution that does not require bloodshed, people of lofty ideals and benevolence will be happy to do their best to achieve it. China and Britain have a common goal and bear important responsibility for world balance. If they can move forward side by side, they will surely become the cornerstone of world stability, which can be asserted.

Another 5% of the ticket revenue, i.e., 1 billion, will be allocated to public housing. The remaining 35%, or 7 billion, will be used entirely for housing loans, after deducting office and printing expenses.

[Report from Pinghu, This Newspaper, 20th] The construction of Jianguo Road in the town requires funds, so charitable housing lottery tickets are being issued.

### Cockfighting Flourishes in Jinhua; Outsmarting the Opponent, Living in Comfort; County Government Attempts to Suppress the Trend Weakening

[Special Dispatch from Jinhua, This Newspaper, 19th] Visitors to Jinhua cannot forget the delicious ham, the scenic beauty of North Mountain, and are eager to see the "cockfighting" entertainment.

Cockfighting is not unique to Jinhua; it also exists in the neighboring counties of Yiwu, Pujiang, Lanxi, and Wuyi. However, it is more commonly seen in Jinhua. Within Jinhua, the northeastern villages are more active than the southwestern ones. In northeastern villages such as Caozhai, Cenxia, Shankoufeng, Xietang, Zhongziyan, and Houlong, cockfights are held almost every ten days, with very few breaks. The origins of this custom are impossible to trace, but it has been around for a long time and has become a tradition. Because it is a folk custom in the old Jinhua area, no one can interfere. In the past, state officials, prefects, and county magistrates would often comply with public sentiment and not dare to prohibit it. Over time, it became a common practice and remains popular to this day.

During the War of Resistance against Japan, the cockfighting trend decreased slightly due to the shortage of rural labor and the collapse of the rural economy. By 1942, Jinlan fell to the enemy one after another, and farmers fled in all directions. Cockfighting once disappeared. After the War of Resistance, farmers in the Jinlan area were happy to have survived the disaster, and their lives became more extravagant, so cockfighting became popular again in the countryside.

Perhaps some readers are eager to know what cockfighting is all about? Many readers have seen the terrifying scenes of Spanish bullfighting in movies, but cockfighting in Jinhua is a different style. Cockfighting in Jinhua is a battle between bulls. A wide, flat paddy field surrounded by low mountains is chosen as the cockfighting ground. These cockfighting grounds mostly belong to temple properties or land donated by landlords and are often used for cockfighting all year round, mostly left barren and uncultivated. Before the cockfight begins, the paddy field is plowed and flooded with a suitable amount of water. At each corner of the field, two green bamboos are used to form a decorative gate, hung with lanterns and ribbons. Amidst the sound of ceremonial cannons, the pair of bulls to be fought are led by the bull's "relatives" (the owners of the pair of bulls to be fought become close friends because of the cockfight) from the two gates on opposite corners, slowly approaching the center of the field in a grand manner, each corner of the cockfighting ground slowly approaching, behaving as if they were invincible. When the two bulls get close, the owners release the ropes of their bulls, and the two bulls begin to fight desperately, refusing to give in to each other. There are also tactics such as "hooking," "ramming," and "pulling." Each bull has its own strategy and tactics to insult the other, all wanting to outsmart the opponent and defeat them. The people watching the cockfight are watching these strategies and tactics. While the two bulls are fighting, dozens of bull separators stand by. These bull separators are all young and strong farmers, mostly with courage and skillful techniques. This occupation is hereditary. If the ancestors of the past separated bulls, the descendants of the next generation must not refuse; except for the days of the cockfight, the temples provide them with wine and meat to eat, and there is no other compensation. But the work is quite dangerous. Whenever the two bulls are fighting to the point where victory or defeat is revealed, they must rush forward and separate the two bulls to prevent them from continuing to fight. Therefore, bull separators are often knocked over into the field by the wild bulls when separating the bulls, and some are even seriously injured and killed by the horns.

Sometimes, there is not enough time to separate the two bulls until the initial victory or defeat is revealed. Then the defeated bull flees in embarrassment from the cockfighting ground, and the victorious bull chases after the fleeing bull, refusing to give up. The bull separators also follow closely behind the bull to find a way to drag it back. After the victory or defeat is clear, the owner of the defeated bull secretly drags his bull away and buys it as a working bull or slaughters it for sale. The owner of the victorious bull washes the bull clean, adds a phoenix crown and red ribbons to the bull's body, and triumphantly returns in a grand manner amidst the sound of drums and gongs.

In ordinary cockfighting grounds, the bulls participating in the fights usually number more than fifty or sixty pairs, and some even have more than one or two hundred pairs. These fighting bulls are mostly driven in from neighboring villages, but in large-scale cockfights, they are driven in from neighboring counties hundreds of miles away. In order to give the fighting bulls that come to the competition a chance to use their skills, there are often three or four pairs of bulls fighting in the same paddy field at the same time. At this time, the low mountains around the paddy field become viewing platforms, with thousands upon thousands of men and women sitting and standing.

These bulls participating in the fights do not have to work in the fields like other working cattle. "Cockfighting" is their only task. They usually live in comfort, and their enjoyment often exceeds the lives of ordinary people. The owner feeds them white glutinous rice, wine lees, soybeans, etc. every day. On the eve of the competition, they are fed ginseng soup and the best old wine to excite their nerves. In winter, the cattle pens are extra warm. In summer, there are hired herders to fan them, and mosquito nets are hung up to prevent them from being disturbed by mosquitoes and getting sick. In short, wealthy farmers generally treat a hundred-battled, hundred-victorious bull with the courtesy of a distinguished guest. Ordinary fighting bulls are mostly raised by wealthy farmers. In areas where cockfighting is popular, wealthy farmers who do not raise fighting bulls are often subject to sanctions from local public opinion.

Generally, cockfighting begins in the summer. Except during excessively bad weather or busy farming periods, they are mostly fought every ten days until the following summer, when they stop. Therefore, it repeats itself, almost non-stop all year round; it is carried out as usual year after year, with very few breaks. The main reasons why this custom can be carried out without interruption are: (1) The countryside lacks proper entertainment, and cockfighting is used as a form of entertainment. (2) The countryside lacks education, and they superstitiously believe that "cockfighting" can eliminate animal plagues, and want to use it to drive away epidemics and protect their only important means of labor. (3) Farmers believe in Buddhism and use this to thank the gods. The county government believes that this custom wastes time and money and wastes labor, and has repeatedly issued orders prohibiting cockfighting, and has implemented three methods of suppression: (1) The fields used as cockfighting grounds that are not used for farming will be allocated to school funds; (2) The bulls participating in the fights will be forced to be slaughtered; (3) Those who take the lead in advocating "cockfighting" will be arrested and punished. However, although the methods are good, they cannot defeat the inherent customs of the local area. The cockfighting trend is popular in Jinhua and the villages and towns of the counties adjacent to Jinhua, and the government that declared war on "cockfighting" has softened and adopted a "let it be" attitude.

### Catholic Education Conference; Successfully Concluded Yesterday; Tian Gengxin Emphasizes the Importance of the Position of School Education

[This Newspaper] The National Catholic Education Conference was held at Aurora Women's College of Arts and Sciences in Shanghai from the 15th of this month for a continuous week and successfully concluded at 4:30 pm on the 21st. The Catholic Church's educational activities in China will be further promoted due to the convening of this conference. Cardinal Tian Gengxin, when giving a closing speech to the conference, strongly stated that school education must occupy a primary position in religious service plans. Archbishop Yu Bin, chairman of the conference, summarized the recommendations of this conference and specifically proposed the establishment of more technical schools, the establishment of a teacher introduction agency, and the reduction of teachers' financial difficulties. Other recommendations made at the conference included the establishment of a Catholic university in Central China, the organization of a National Catholic Alumni Association, and a request to the government to allow the establishment of normal schools. Some representatives also advocated promoting the importance of family education to assist schools in training children. Vice Archbishop Gao Siqian, Secretary-General of the Conference, spoke about the need for unity and cooperation among Catholic schools nationwide at the meeting on the morning of the 21st. Vice Archbishop Gao first explained the importance of unity to generate strength, and pointed out that the twentieth century is the century of collectivism, so unity is also to adapt to the trend of the times. In terms of the benefits of unity and cooperation, it can internally allow mutual observation and learning, mutual assistance and mutual benefit, and externally facilitate requests to the government to improve inappropriate laws and regulations.

### Normal School Students Exempted From Tuition, Renovation, and Miscellaneous Fees; Municipal Education Bureau Submits Request for Approval to the Mayor

[Special Dispatch] The fee amounts for municipal secondary schools this semester have been stipulated by the Municipal Government. It is reported that the Municipal Education Bureau believes that the families of normal school students are mostly poor, and their service after graduation is particularly arduous. According to ministerial regulations, not only should they not be charged any fees, but they should also be given various subsidies as encouragement. The situation of students in midwifery and nursing schools is similar. This city has always been financially strained, and normal school students are only provided with room and board, without subsidies for uniforms, pocket money, and books. As for nursing and midwifery students, they even have to pay for their own meals, which is already a heavier burden compared to national schools. If they are further required to pay various fees, it would seem contrary to the government's intention of preferential treatment. After careful consideration by the Municipal Education Bureau and Director Li, a special request was submitted to Mayor Wu, proposing that starting from this semester, all fees collected by secondary schools should be waived for students in normal schools and midwifery/nursing schools. Apart from the teacher training fee, which will be supplemented from the original budget, the other two items, renovation and miscellaneous fees (480,000 yuan per student for renovation and 300,000 yuan for miscellaneous fees, totaling 780,000 yuan), calculated based on a total of 1,200 students, will result in a shortfall of 936 million yuan. The daily expenses of these schools depend on this fund, making it difficult to find a way to offset the loss. Therefore, a request is submitted to Mayor Wu for approval to add a budget to be paid by the municipal treasury in one lump sum for relief.

### National Games Transportation Issues; Transportation Committee Holds Meeting; Three Measures Agreed Upon Yesterday

[Special Dispatch] The Seventh National Games are scheduled to be held at the Jiangwan Stadium on May 5th. At that time, the attendees will be extremely crowded. The Transportation Committee of the Games held its first meeting yesterday afternoon at the Public Works Bureau, chaired by Zhao Zengjue, who is also the director of the committee, to discuss transportation issues. According to general estimates, there will be 100,000 attendees on the opening day, and an average of 60,000 attendees per day. The transportation arrangements must be planned in advance. After discussion, the following resolutions were made: (1) Citizens from Pudong and the southern part of the city will use ferries. The Municipal Ferry Company will operate special ferries from Dongmen Road to Qiu Jiang Wharf, and then use motor vehicles to transport them to the stadium. (2) Citizens from the western districts of Shanghai will use the railway. The Railway Bureau will operate temporary special trains. (3) Residents of the city proper are encouraged to use public transportation as much as possible, and private transportation companies are requested to assist in transportation. According to Director Zhao yesterday, although transportation can be resolved, the difficulty lies in the roads in the area, which have not been repaired, making it extremely difficult for motor vehicles to travel. The roads urgently needing repair include Huangxing Road, Qimei Road, and Yinxiang Road Bridge. The Public Works Bureau is requested to first estimate the budget and then submit it to the Municipal Affairs Conference for discussion and decision.

Hualian sent Xue Chongcheng, Zhang Zhenzhong, Xiang Cheng, and Guangyi as their starting lineup. After the initial contact, Hualian was taken advantage of by Qiantang due to unfamiliarity with the field. The home team took the lead, but the score was very close. Later, Hualian gradually became accustomed to the field and took a 34 to 20 lead in the first half. After switching sides, Hualian launched a fierce attack. Although Qiantang tried to fight back, they were ultimately outmatched in skill and suffered a complete defeat. Hualian was unstoppable. By the time the game ended, Hualian had won by a large margin of 81 to 38.

After the match, Kui Zhenzhong, the main player of the Hualian team, told a Guoguang News Agency reporter that, given the meager income from this exhibition match, all of Hualian's expenses in Hangzhou, including round-trip transportation, were borne by team leader Zhong Yuting, and no relief funds would be used to increase revenue.

As for the cash required for purchase, President Zhang of the National Bank stated during his visit to Taiwan that he would do his best to assist, so there should be no problem in raising funds. The exact production volume of Taiwan Sugar for this year will not be clear until March. However, due to the unexpected typhoon that hit Taiwan Island in November and December last year, sugar production will be affected. Therefore, it is estimated that the planned production volume of 300,000 tons will be reduced by about 10%. However, this number is still much higher than last year's production volume.

### Tea Market Remains Firm

Since the base exchange rate was readjusted by the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee a few days ago, the foreign trade tea market, which had been dormant for many days, showed a glimmer of hope yesterday. However, the number of transactions was still not large, and the selling price was pushed up strongly across the board. As for domestic sales tea, because many people from this street and foreign traders inquired, the market sentiment was still strong. Holders were holding firm to their asking prices, so the potential continued to show its advantages, and the market was standing strong and powerfully.

It was recently heard from colleagues that after the inventory of various products tended to shrink, although the buying trend in the market was still strong, it was like climbing a tree to catch a fish. Looking at this situation, the future is likely to be easy to rise and difficult to fall.

### Financial Authority Strictly Inspects Group Arbitrage Business

This year, various banks, money shops, and trust companies in this city have been absorbing idle funds and organizing group arbitrage, a trend that has emerged rapidly. Attracted by high interest rates, many citizens have invested in arbitrage through these banks, shops, and companies. Although these institutions' arbitrage activities are intended to encourage investment, the use of public funds to trade securities poses a risk. Should mismanagement occur, the public is bound to suffer. To prevent such malpractices and protect the property rights of the people, the financial authorities have dispatched personnel to conduct strict inspections of these institutions' group arbitrage businesses.

### Industrial Raw Materials Continue to Rise

Triangle brand glycerin (50 lbs per can) has risen to seven million three hundred thousand dollars, an increase of five hundred thousand dollars. In addition, hydrosulfite, rosin, baking soda, and stearin have mostly risen by ten to twenty percent.

### Eased Liquidity, Strong Appetite: Cotton Yarn Market Jumps Wildly; 42-Count Blue Phoenix Exceeds 80 Million Mark

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw a surge in prices due to exceptionally loose liquidity among traders and reports of continued high prices in other ports. Both carters and customers showed strong appetite, with sellers stopping sales and turning to buying, and the market saw wild jumps again. Although the Textile and Construction Company repeatedly listed prices high, the consistently strong sentiment drove new high prices one after another.

42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn immediately hit the 80 million mark at the opening. Subsequently, due to vigorous lifting by outside traders, buying sentiment pervaded, and market prices rose all the way, breaking through the 80 million mark and reaching a new record high of 84.45 million dollars. The closing price continued to soar by 5.5 million dollars compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarns also surged by 2 million to 6.45 million dollars, with fine yarns rising higher overall.

Cloth Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday's cotton cloth market started steadily, but then heard of yarn prices continuing to surge. Despite the period of cloth sales by the Textile and Construction Company, the market was flooded with loose credit, remittances from other ports arrived continuously, customers competed to buy, dyeing factories also absorbed strongly, and traders lifted vigorously, so buying sentiment unfolded and prices continued to rise.

12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth soared all the way to a high closing price of 2.15 million dollars, continuing to rise by 50,000 dollars from the previous day. Other grades of fine cloth also rose by 30,000 to 65,000 dollars. In addition, khaki, twill, coarse cloth, grey cloth, and shirting also rose by 12,000 to 120,000 dollars, especially grey cloth and shirting prices rose significantly.

[Our Reporter] The Yarn Control Committee yesterday continued to entrust the Textile and Construction Company to open for sale 18 types of yarn at the Yarn Traders Association, with a total of about 2,000 pieces approved for purchase. The purchase permits and yarn prices must be revealed tomorrow morning.

Also, the Textile and Construction Company yesterday, as usual, opened for sale 26 types of cloth and 2 types of blankets, resulting in a total of 49,850 bolts of cloth and 180 blankets sold. There were a total of 1,702 applications, of which 35 were from manufacturers, purchasing 1,840 bolts of cloth, and the rest were purchased by various cloth shops. Purchase permits must also be issued tomorrow morning.

Spot Cotton Sees Mixed Rise and Fall

Yesterday's spot cotton market saw a slight decrease in the upward momentum, and appetite relaxed. The market has been rising for days, and sentiment was exhausted, resulting in few transactions. Later, with cotton yarn rising again, market sentiment stabilized. Many floats were cashed in at higher prices, and yarn factories made slight embellishments. Spot prices saw mixed rise and fall, with 380 bales traded. Factory delivery prices opened with Lingbao at 10.24 million and Huoji at 8.019 million, with 184 bales traded. Warehouse delivery prices opened with Yarn City at 9.094 million, Jingyang at 10.58 million, and Han fine at 8.35 million, with 200 bales traded. Zhoupu cotton seeds were at 1.96 million, a slight decrease of 40,000.

[Our Reporter] The British Company's "Castledyke" arrived from Bombay yesterday, carrying more than 23,660 bales of cotton.

### Woolen Fabrics Stabilize

Wholesale trading of woolen fabrics remains low, so standards remain unchanged. Current customers are being accommodated by the owners. The retail business of shops and stores is largely the same as in previous years. Store prices are all similar to last year. Changhua flannel is the same as the previous lunar month, still priced at 350,000 dollars per ten feet. The future market for woolen fabrics is subject to different interpretations and perspectives.

### Silk and Satin Consistently Rise

Yesterday, the Suzhou market initially remained flat, then rose, resulting in another significant increase of 7 million dollars compared to the previous day. No. 120, Xu brand Jin San Shu with luster, opened around 16 million dollars in the morning. Due to the continued easing of credit conditions and strong appetite, it rose, and by the noon closing, the price for the Monday period was 24 million dollars. Afternoon trading was quiet, and the market remained stable. The final price was 23 million dollars for selling Sinyar with luster. Transactions occurred at 8 million dollars in the morning, and the opening price was 10 million dollars in the afternoon.

The factory-direct market surged yesterday. Although actual sales were sluggish, buying interest among traders was strong, resulting in prices rising uniformly by as much as 10 million dollars, but no transactions occurred. Two dan of high-grade goods were opened for sale, priced at 20 million dollars. Dried warp also rose yesterday, with five dan of 2/8 split goods opened for sale, approaching 100 million dollars. The silk market rose yesterday due to the high cost of raw materials and boosted confidence. Huaqiang true silk duvet covers opened at around 8.1 million dollars, and then soared due to high demand and limited supply, once fluctuating in the middle, and closing again with an increase, reaching as high as 9.3 million dollars for immediate delivery. Dacheng plaid crepe was initially offered at 210,000 dollars, and someone wanted it, closing at 215,000 dollars. Factory prices for other goods all rose.

### Overseas Remittance Revenue Outlook is Dim; Bank of China Seeks to Encourage it by Delivering Remittances Directly to Recipients

[Our Reporter] To encourage overseas remittances, the Bank of China has recently implemented a method of delivering remittances directly to recipients in areas near Guangzhou where families of overseas Chinese are concentrated, and also assists their families in writing letters. Concerned individuals have stated that the decline in overseas remittances is mainly due to the large difference between official and black market exchange rates, and subsidies are not a thorough solution. Based on the current situation, it is estimated that overseas remittances can reach 100 million US dollars this year, but this may not be as expected. The overseas remittance figures for January were slightly higher due to the New Year.

[Another News] The preparatory work for the Bank of China's Tokyo branch is progressing actively. Manager Chiang Wu-i is waiting for his passport to be issued and will fly directly to Tokyo. However, business is difficult to develop before the peace treaty is established. Mr. Zhang recently stated: "The branch's business is aimed at private trade. It will do its best to assist with the deposit and remittance of private trade, and overseas remittances are also among the operations. The opening date will be decided after arrival." Only two accompanying personnel have been approved by MacArthur's headquarters.

Also, it was recently learned from the Overseas Remittance Group of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau that the total amount of overseas remittances received by the Bureau last month has increased slightly compared to the past, totaling 5.4 billion yuan. Among them, remittances from Chase Bank in New York, China Banking Corporation in Hong Kong, Overseas Chinese Bank in Hong Kong, and Banco Nacional Ultramarino in Macau are more numerous.

### Commercial Arbitration Association Established; Wang Xiaolai and 32 Others Elected as Directors and Supervisors

[Our Reporter] The China Commercial Arbitration Association held its inaugural meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the China Merchants Bureau Building, with more than 50 members and 30 guests attending. The meeting was chaired by Wang Xiaolai, the head of the association's preparatory committee. Mr. Wang gave an opening speech, stating that the history of commercial arbitration in China is the longest and most praised by countries in the world. The establishment of the China Commercial Arbitration Association was initiated in October of the 34th year of the Republic (1945) at the suggestion of the US government and was endorsed by the Chinese government and business community. Due to the extremely close trade relations between China and the United States, commercial disputes are inevitable. To meet the needs of modern commercial conditions, arbitration institutions in various countries are vying to establish themselves. However, China's commercial arbitration institutions have not yet had a complete organization. In order to unite the business community and other professional groups, adopt methods of reconciliation, mediation, and arbitration to resolve commercial disputes, sign agreements with the American Arbitration Association, and establish joint arbitration, the government decided to invite the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the National Industrial Association, together with national business and professional groups, to be responsible for preparatory work.

Secretary-General Shou Jingwei then reported on the preparation process. Guests delivered speeches separately. Finally, the articles of association were amended, and directors and supervisors were elected. The elected directors are Wang Xiaolai, Xi Yushu, Wu Yun Chu, Chen Tingrui, Zhuang Zhihuan, Jiang Yiping, Shou Jingwei, Xu Xueyu, Li Ming, Luo Beichen, Dong Yunzhang, Shen Rixin, and 25 others. The supervisors are Xu Jiyi, Du Yuesheng, Qiu Liangrong, and 7 others. It was also decided to hold the first joint meeting of the directors and supervisors tomorrow to elect the chairman and executive directors. The association's address is temporarily located at China Tea Joint Venture Company, No. 5 Tumingyuan Road, this city.

### Unlicensed Western Medicines Arriving at Port: Purchase Prices to be Announced

The Review Committee for Handling Unlicensed Goods Arriving at Port with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange convened a meeting in the afternoon of the 21st to discuss the compulsory purchase of goods such as communications equipment, Western medicines, and trucks. Regarding the purchase-related prices, procedures, and types, decisions have been made and will be formally announced in the coming days. At the same time, the markup for all arriving goods has also been decided. This work has now come to a stage. In the future, in addition to holding regular meetings once a week, temporary meetings will be held again if special events occur.

### Private Cotton Yarn Inspection to Begin on February 23rd

[Our Reporter] The Technical Division of the Yarn Control Committee has completed the inspection of cotton yarn from state-run yarn factories and the 17 factories of the Textile and Construction Company. The committee has decided to begin inspecting cotton yarn from private yarn factories starting on February 23rd, and has notified the six district cotton spinning associations to inform private yarn factories to send representatives to participate.

It is reported that the private representatives for sampling were Geng Xin-i and Zhu Huai; the representatives for inspection were Zhang Yuzu from the Textile and Construction Company, Hua Shaosheng from the private sector, and Gu Duhuan from foreign yarn factories.

### Ministry of Finance Cables Various Municipal Governments to Prohibit Money Exchangers from Operating Illegal Businesses; Existing Licenses to be Canceled Within a Deadline

The municipal government recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, stating that since the promulgation and implementation of emergency economic measures, the buying and selling of gold and foreign currency has been prohibited. Money exchangers originally engaged in foreign currency exchange should immediately cease operations and liquidate. Furthermore, those who are not engaged in financial business but use the names of money shops or banks should be banned and reported to the Ministry for compliance. Previously, it was reported that in major cities across the country, some money exchangers were still using their original licenses to secretly engage in illegal business, which is inappropriate and should be uniformly banned. Their original licenses should be canceled within a deadline to comply with the law. Please investigate and handle this matter. After receiving the telegram, the municipal government immediately ordered the social affairs, finance, and police bureaus to jointly investigate and report.

### Inside and Outside the Great Wall

— Photos by Gu Tingpeng and Yu Chuangshuo

Dawning moon passes the cold temple, bright stars lodge at the old pass.

Cold birds and withered grass everywhere accompany sorrowful faces.

Lonely scenes in the land of falling leaves, pity you, what brings you to the edge of the world?

Once, the battlements connected to the northern deserts, leaving only ruins facing the dusk.

Travelers from You and Bing have always aged with dust and sand.

Yellow dust fills past and present, white bones are scattered among the weeds.

Watering horses crossing the autumn water, the water is cold and the wind is like a knife.

Wild geese disappear into the clouds on the edge of the barbarian sky, sheep return to the hillsides in the smoky mist of cold grass.

The sun sets on the flat sands, dimly seeing Lintao.

### Women and Fashion

— Jingwen

The love of beauty and novelty is human nature, especially for ladies. According to the saying, "Women adorn themselves for those who appreciate them," dressing up and being beautiful can be said to be their duty. To tell the truth, what gentleman doesn't like to see his wife dressed beautifully, and what father with a daughter doesn't want to see his daughter like a beautiful flower? This psychology is true human nature, and it is the normal state of mind.

As Frank Harris once said: If there were no women in the world, it would be like a garden with only trees, although lush, it would inevitably be too lonely and too monotonous. So, even a sacred being like Jehovah, after initially creating Adam, also took bone and flesh from him to create Eve, to accompany him.

However, although God can create women, it is likely that even as holy as He is, He did not understand women's psychology. He thought that women were only created for the needs of men, so initially He did not want them to know that this world might have the beauty of clothing, and only made them live naked in the Garden of Eden.

But Eve was, after all, a woman. Before she had a self-awareness of feminine beauty, she was finally tempted by that pair of bright red apples. Despite Jehovah's serious warning in advance, she still ate them. This one bite of hers was not a big deal, but it has benefited fashion store owners for generations and distressed gentlemen's pockets. Why? Because since she ate the apple, she had a sense of shame and demanded to wear clothes.

The problem of clothing may not matter to some people, but for women it is a second life. This is by no means an exaggeration. Not long ago, didn't women in Britain and the United States hold demonstrations over the length of skirts? I am not a moralist. I even think that a country whose women are willing to demonstrate for the trivial matter of clothing proves how vibrant the society of this country is. On the contrary, everyone in uniform blue long gowns, simplicity is certainly simple, but it also only proves the poverty of this country.

Know that the problem of beauty is not the same as the problem of extravagance. Look at some bejeweled ladies. Luxury is luxury, but other than being vulgar, there is no beauty to be found. The concept of beauty is cultivated from a person's spiritual refinement. If ladies are willing to pay attention to the beauty of their clothes, they can indeed add a lot of color to society. However, it must be noted that the beauty of education will not become vulgar. Otherwise, shortening and lengthening, merely seeking formal novelty, is waste rather than seeking beauty.

### Equality and Similarity

— Bao Zhiying

Equality and similarity have absolutely different definitions in geometry, but many people confuse these two terms. For example, the repetition of history only includes the meaning of the similarity of two or several historical facts, but many people, even scholars and professors, think that the repetition of history is equality between the past and future.

A very large equilateral triangle and a very small equilateral triangle, although their three interior angles are all "equal" to sixty degrees, however, looking at these two entire equilateral triangles, they only belong to "similarity" in geometry; similarly, history is always a thing of the past, strictly speaking, history will never repeat itself, at most a few parts of the environment seem to be similar, or some factors are the same. The situation of Germany after the First World War and Japan after the Second World War is certainly very similar, and their encounters are very similar, but we cannot say that Germany is "equal" to Japan!

Someone said that history is like a sine curve, starting from zero function, going through positive, zero, negative one and returning to zero, and then progressing cyclically in this order. At first glance, this theory seems to be somewhat like the first sentence of Romance of the Three Kingdoms: "It is said that the general trend of the world, after a long period of division, must unite, and after a long period of union, must divide." If we analyze it carefully, we will know that the former represents periodic "equality", and the function value obtained every three hundred and sixty degrees is absolutely the same; but the latter is not. This old tune fully expresses the art and smoothness of Chinese people's speech. It only explains the meaning of "similarity". On the surface, it seems very affirmative, but in reality, it is equal to saying: "After many sunny days, it will definitely rain; after it rains, the sky will definitely turn sunny." Although the word "definitely" is said twice in a decisive tone, there is no time limit for "long" and "after", so I think this only represents some "equality" in the "similar" triangle.

To give another example, under certain circumstances, especially in a warm atmosphere, such as reading quietly under a lamp, burying one's head in meditation, resting under a tree, etc., people often feel a very familiar feeling. In fact, maybe you have indeed experienced this scene, because this environment can make you feel happy and relaxed, so it is easy to produce an impression, and you will associate the past scene with similar situations, but in fact, the environment has changed somewhat, and it cannot be exactly the same, unless time flows backwards.

Spring, summer, autumn, and winter, the four seasons cycle endlessly, but the seasons are different every year. How many times can the average temperature be equal, despite the warm and cold weather?

Therefore, Einstein said: There is nothing in the world that can be said to be "equal".

### The White Cloud Temple of Beiping

— Liu Yansheng

During the New Year, most people like to go out and travel. In addition, famous places are open by agreement during the New Year, just like the Niangniang Temple in Tianjin and the City God Temple in Shanghai. There are many people who go to visit and worship in the Buddhist and Taoist fields. There are even more people who go to travel and enjoy themselves with friends. There are also many places open during the New Year in Beiping, mostly in the suburbs outside the city. Therefore, we have seen many people traveling to visit the famous places for the Spring Festival during the New Year.

Du Gongbu's poem "Beautiful Lady's Walk" says: "On the third day of the third month, the weather is new, and there are many beautiful ladies by the waterside in Chang'an." This can be said to be taking the opportunity to travel because the weather is warm. Now, these people are not afraid of the chilling spring, and the taste of winter has not yet faded, and they are going to visit, which can be said to be a not shallow.

The White Cloud Temple in the western suburbs of Beiping has the most days open during the New Year. Other places such as the Dongyue Temple, the Great Bell Temple, and Changdian are almost all open until the Lantern Festival. Only the White Cloud Temple closes on the 19th day of the first lunar month, and the day before there are laymen giving alms, and there is a "meeting of immortals" in the evening. Although it involves superstition, this custom has been passed down for a long time and shows no sign of declining. As everyone celebrates the Spring Festival, these embellishments add a lot of prosperity.

The White Cloud Temple is a large Taoist temple in the near suburbs of Beiping. It is the temporary residence of Qiu Chuji of the Yuan Dynasty, and it has a great influence in leading Taoism. Because the abbot of the White Cloud Temple participated in court affairs at the end of the Qing Dynasty, his influence increased sharply, and many wealthy merchants were willing to go there to give alms. When it was open during the lunar New Year, merchants were invited to set up stalls, and all the old Taoists in the temple were mobilized to handle the Spring Festival opening. In general, tourists always feel that they must go to the White Cloud Temple during the New Year. In the past, from the early years of the Republic of China (1911-1912) until the teens, there were car and horse races behind the White Cloud Temple. Teahouses were built on both sides, and there was a very wide track in the middle. Gentlemen, because they had cars and horses at home, went to this place to show off and compete with each other. Although there were no prizes, it was most glamorous to have a beautiful car and horse and be the first in the race. When they passed, people drinking tea in the teahouses shouted and cheered, very much like the cheerleaders in today's ball games. However, this has disappeared with the rise in the cost of living and the changes of the times. Not only is there no interest in it, but even the wealthy families of that year now feel that their strength is insufficient, so it has been abolished invisibly. The track still exists now, but the people who used to compete don't know where they are now!

The White Cloud Temple is not very far from the city of Beiping. In addition to various vehicles, there is also a common sight during the New Year, which is that everyone rides donkeys. Riding a small donkey in the face of the spring breeze on the flat sandy plains is also a picture of enjoyment in the Spring Festival of Beiping. Now, the cost of riding a donkey is quite enough to buy several long-eared male donkeys in those days. Li Yuwen introduced the famous violinist Joshua Heifetz to a boxing champion at a banquet. Out of politeness, Mr. Heifetz had to talk to him politely.

"We are in the same business," said Mr. Heifetz, "We all make a living with our hands, haha."

The boxer looked him up and down and said:

"Gosh, it's good for you that there are no marks on your face!"

### On Forbearance

— Ti Zhai

Many people praise Du Mu's line of poetry: "Forbearance brings joy in the aftermath." But in reality, this is nothing more than a negative way of saying "A small act of impatience ruins great plans," and there is nothing particularly unusual about it. If one ponders it carefully, the ability to endure is a state that is not easily attained by those who strive for virtue. Perhaps what is meant by "joy in the aftermath" is not the thing endured, but one's own self-cultivation. Buddhists also speak of endurance, humility, diligence, and progress, which are different from what Ah Q did. Ah Q still had a fabricated sense of victory to comfort his empty feelings and emotions of failure, while this [Buddhism] requires genuine "no ignorance" and "also no end to no ignorance," "no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind, no form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or dharma." If one does not regard all phenomena as empty, then the "fire of ignorance" will inevitably arise. Jesus advised people that if someone strikes your left cheek, offer them the right one as well. This is not pure forbearance, but also has an element of sacrifice. What I mean by forbearance, in the narrow sense, is not changing one's expression. Personally, I am truly unable to achieve this virtue.

The opposite of forbearance is contention, which has been opposed by sages and worthies throughout history. Only Cui Dongbi, who liked to be skeptical of antiquity, advocated contention, and wrote a grand article called "Debate," which contained many brilliant arguments, but I cannot quote them all here. I just feel that forbearance is a tremendous burden, both physically and mentally. The source of this forbearance must contain the word "anger." According to Western scientists, hunger, fear, pain, and anger can cause drastic changes in the nerves. When an angry dog is X-rayed, its stomach immediately stops moving, and digestion can cease for more than two hours. Although humans are higher in position than dogs, the physiological response to anger should be no different, so I say that enduring humiliation, which means containing anger, is a physical burden. As for the mental burden, I need not say more, everyone can understand it. Here, I offer another opinion: that forbearance and cruelty may well originate from the same source. Forbearance is directed towards oneself, while cruelty is directed towards others, but their basic inclination is the same: "inhumanity." Zhang Xianzhong and Huang Chao killed people for pleasure, and Ma Shumou ate human flesh for pleasure, and are indeed the abominable ancestors of cruelty. But are the Japanese, who light white paper lanterns and commit ritual suicide in the dark, and then have their good friends cut off their heads (which the Japanese call "kaishaku"), not also cruel? We cannot say that being cruel to others is evil, but being cruel to oneself is good. Of course, we cannot compare all forbearance to ritual suicide, but enduring a burden that one does not want to bear is essentially the same as enduring being killed. So I suspect that someone who can endure what others cannot endure is probably a cruel fellow. There are countless examples in history. Goujian, the King of Yue, tasted the feces for the King of Wu, and endured hardship and planned revenge, but later he killed Wen Zhong and alienated the doctor Fan Li. The King of Han shared the soup of his father, but later he killed Han Xin and Peng Yue. Fan Zeng's words were truly meaningful: "The King is not forbearing." These two words, "not forbearing," vividly portray an honest and loyal Xiang Yu, and it was already destined that he would not achieve great success.

Mencius put it even better: "Everyone has a heart that cannot bear to see the suffering of others," which is a sense of compassion, and is "the beginning of benevolence." This heart seems like it should be easy to develop, but from ancient times to the present, how many people have truly been able to practice forbearance everywhere? There has not even been a decade without war in all of Chinese history, so you can know what this so-called culture and civilization of mankind really is! War is just the most concrete aspect of forbearance. Society as a whole has always consisted of two classes: the exploiters and the exploited. If you are not an exploiter, you will inevitably become an exploited one, and their survival is based on the word "endure." The exploited must endure hardship in exchange for food and warmth, and the exploiters must close their eyes to the many pitiful creatures in order to fill their own pockets. Because of this, I often feel that Aesop's Fables are very unreasonable. Why use foxes, lions, dogs, and donkeys to describe people? Frankly speaking, the animal society is actually much more "humanized" than human society. At least the two relationships mentioned above do not exist. Prostitution, venereal disease, lawsuits, and hypocrites... do not exist. Although the Englishman Hobbes said that "man meets man as a wolf," wolves are ultimately much easier to deal with than people. Ultimately, this is because beasts do not have the virtues and concepts of "forbearance." If you don't believe me, look again: what happened to Gandhi, who showed love throughout his life and always advocated non-resistance?

### Razor's Edge

— Mao Yi

·Haverford·Taft· An American federal judge from Ohio. One morning, he went to a barbershop for a shave.

"Are you Judge Taft, sir?" the barber asked as he prepared to shave Taft.

"Yes, I am," Taft replied, settling his massive frame comfortably.

"Do you remember a man named Stabbins? You sentenced him to twenty years in prison." The barber was carefully honing a razor. He was a tall black man. Taft noticed an ugly scar on his face that ran from his cheekbone to his chin.

"Yes, I remember Stabbins," Taft replied, "a bad egg."

"He was my brother," the barber said. He placed the razor against the judge's throat. For the next few minutes, the only sound in the small barbershop was the scraping of the razor. As the sharp blade moved up and down between Taft's jaw and throat, he felt himself begin to sweat. He closed his eyes, contemplating the end of his life and what awaited him.

Finally, the barber stepped back and snapped the razor shut. "Alright, Judge," he said. "You did the right thing. My brother was not a good man. He deserved to go to jail."

[Editor's Note: Continuation of "Wandering Flowers" not received, will be suspended for one day.]

### Record of Scattering Wealth

— Ru Yi

Prince Condé of France wanted to test his son's financial management skills, so before leaving Paris, he gave the boy fifty gold Louis (a type of French gold coin in the past—translator's note) to spend as he pleased.

When the Prince returned home, the boy happily ran up to him and said, "Father, the money is here, I haven't spent a single coin."

Without a word, the Prince led his son to the window and silently threw all fifty gold Louis onto the street outside.

Then he said, "Son, if you had 'virtue,' you would have already given this money to others; if you had 'ability,' you would have spent this money very appropriately. If you have neither virtue nor ability, then in the future you should often do as I have just done—at least give the poor a chance to receive some of your money."

### Tao Qian Begging for Food

— Yu Xinhua

Tao Qian refused to bow down for five pecks of rice, resigned his post and returned to his farm. In his later years, he wrote a poem about begging for food: "I come and go, not knowing where I am going. I walk and walk until I reach this village, where I stand at the door, clumsy in my words." One can imagine his poverty. Wang Wei, a famous poet of the Tang Dynasty, wrote a letter to Layman Wei, in which he said: "Recently there was Tao Qian, who refused to bend his waist to see the inspector because of his post and resigned his official position. Later, he was poor and begged for food, and wrote in a poem: 'I stand at the door, clumsy in my words,' which means he was often ashamed from begging. If he had just seen the inspector, he could have eaten from the public fields for several acres. He could not bear one instance of shame, and ended up being ashamed for the rest of his life?"

If one stands from the position of a pragmatist, what Wang Wei said is the truth; rather than being poor and begging for food, it is better to endure being bullied and be a happy magistrate. However, "starving to death is a small matter, losing integrity is a big matter." Tao Qian's refusal to see the inspector was long seen by a group of people as a disguise for "not serving two surnames." Therefore, the moralists expressed strong disgust for Wang Wei's remarks.

It is said that Wang Wei could sing the "Yu Lun Pao" song and was deeply appreciated by a certain princess of the time, so he was able to become a Jinshi. Later, he surrendered to An Lushan and accepted a false appointment, so Zhang Erqi of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties severely criticized Wang Wei. He said: "Mo Jie's views are thus. Based on this, 'Yu Lun Pao' is not a false accusation. When he held Zheng Qian's hand and shed tears while chanting the lines about the Ningbi Pool, and when he heard the disposal order for the first time, and thought back to the old man of Chaisang, dragging his staff to visit relatives and friends, who should be ashamed and who should not be ashamed?" He scolded him quite viciously, which is not surprising, as Zhang Erqi was originally a figure of Gu Tinglin's school. After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, they all lived in seclusion and wrote books, so they naturally ridiculed Wang Wei.

Du Fu has a poem dedicated to Censor Zhao Jian, saying: "Riding a donkey for thirty years, I lived in the capital in the spring. In the morning, I knock on the doors of the rich, and in the evening, I follow the dust of fat horses. Leftover wine and cold food, everywhere I secretly feel sad and bitter." His appearance of wagging his tail and begging for mercy is really disgusting. Gong Ding'an once wrote a poem ridiculing Du Fu, saying: "Tao Qian's nature is straightforward and gentle, and he is secretly rewarded for the kindness of a meal. I feel that Shao Ling's poetry is thin, only saying that he knocks on the doors of the rich in the morning." The same is begging for food, but one is abandoning his official position, and the other is pursuing fame and success. The two cannot be compared.

### The Socialization of Universities (Part 1)

— Wu Yong

A university is a higher academic institution. As the name suggests, it should have a strong academic atmosphere. I do not know the inner workings of today's universities; when I was studying at university, I also did not know the inner workings of other universities. Although I am not Mencius' mother, I have also changed universities three times. Based on my personal experience, I can briefly describe my impressions as follows.

Universities overly emphasize exams. Upon entering university, there is a university entrance exam. During the semester, there are a prescribed number of so-called "small tests," and teachers also give impromptu tests "as they feel like it." At the end of the semester, there is naturally the so-called "big exam." Students do not choose just one subject, and there is more than one teacher, so you test me, I test you, test today, test tomorrow, a small test every three days, a big test every five days, tested until one's head is dizzy and one's heart is filled with unspeakable sorrow. Cross-examination and firm-examination, what is the meaning of it? I still don't understand it. I remember the most ridiculous thing was that there was an American teacher who taught English and used Stevenson's "Treasure Island" as the textbook. Once, during an exam, he asked a rather bizarre question: How many robbers were mentioned in "Treasure Island," and how many were left by a certain chapter? Alas! What relationship does this kind of question have with one's English performance? Students spend precious time and money, and should be focusing on how to devote all their energy to learning the knowledge they want to acquire, but now they are wasting it on boring exams. Is this not a very regrettable thing?

Universities, like other institutions in our country, have become mere formalities. Teachers and students only know to respond to the bell to go to class, and to wait for the bell to dismiss class. Upon hearing the bell, students swarm into the classroom like a flock of sheep, and upon hearing the bell again, they file out of the classroom as if relieved of a heavy burden. Among the teachers, there are indeed occasional erudite scholars, but there are also not a few whose ambition is only to earn a living as educators. When these people teach, they either speak nonsense or stammer, in short, they say whatever comes to mind, rarely hitting the essence of the matter. Thus, the teachers mumble to themselves, and the students gossip among themselves. A few kind-hearted and intelligent people diligently write, transcribing the teacher's mumbles into notes. Even fewer talented people, regretting the waste of time, either write books or bury themselves in reading what they love to read.

The most incomprehensible thing about universities is the so-called "credit" system. You must complete a total of five credits in "History," six credits in "Chinese," four credits in "Banking," three credits in "Currency"... If you have no interest in "Banking" or know that you already have a good understanding of "Banking" and see no need to take another four credits, but want to replace it with another four credits in "Currency" and tell this to the registrar's office, the registrar's office will not only look at you strangely, but will certainly say sternly: "How can this be!" Because the school authorities have prepared "goods" that are only four credits for banking, and only three credits for currency, and there is no way to increase or decrease them, and students have no way to exchange them. This is like holding a horse's head down to drink water. If the horse is willing to let you do as you please, then this horse must not be a fine horse. But this is not surprising, as there are not many "Bo Les" (excellent horse trainers) on campus, so they simply treat all students as inferior horses. And students who have completed the prescribed number of subjects and credits and have passed the so-called "exams" are then considered "graduated" and are called "bachelors" or some other type of scholar; this is simply a mysterious and unfathomable thing.

Under this situation of poor teachers and excessive emphasis on formalities, the academic atmosphere has been completely lost—or perhaps it can be said that there has never been an academic atmosphere in the first place. Students entering such a university to study is like "climbing a tree to catch fish." The waste of manpower and money, and the loss of time and career are at their worst.

I have often thought about it: Why must students go through an "entrance exam" to enter university? For example, a businessman suddenly feels interested in "textual research," and Dr. Hu Shih is the most renowned expert in the study of "textual research" in China and abroad. This businessman urgently wants to hear Dr. Hu Shih's grand theories. Suppose this businessman is very busy and is not familiar with the subjects required for the entrance exam, such as English and algebra, or although he knew them before, he has now completely forgotten them, and he is only interested in the textual research class taught by Dr. Hu Shih. Under the restriction of the entrance exam, this businessman cannot easily achieve his purpose and has to give up his aspiration to study. University education is not compulsory education, but this businessman has enough money to pay tuition and he has a desire to study. What reason do we have to exclude him from the university? In order to study textual research, if this businessman gives up his business and re-studies English, algebra, and other subjects to take the exam, even if he is lucky enough to be admitted, would this price not be too high? This is one reason. Second: Why does the university stipulate a four-year system? If you regard the "school year" as the "hard labor" of a prisoner, or the "seclusion" of a monk, then how much is a person's life? Two years is too much. If you treat "education" as "education," then forty years is too little; what we want to learn is not something that can be learned in four years?
