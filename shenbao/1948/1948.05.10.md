### Temporary Provisions During the Period of National Crisis Promulgated by the National Government; Hong Lanyou Appointed Secretary-General of the National Construction Mobilization Committee; National Assembly to Convene Temporary Session No Later Than Next Year

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The National Government has specially promulgated the Temporary Provisions of the Constitution during the Period of National Crisis. The order reads as follows: Order of the National Government: The First National Assembly, in its first session, formulated the Temporary Provisions during the Period of National Crisis in accordance with the procedure of Article 174, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, which is hereby promulgated. This order.

Temporary Provisions During the Period of National Crisis

These Temporary Provisions during the Period of National Crisis are formulated in accordance with the procedure of Article 174, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution as follows:

During the Period of National Crisis, in order to avoid urgent danger or hardship to the nation or its people, or to cope with major financial and economic changes, the President may, with the resolution of the Executive Yuan Council, take emergency measures without being restricted by the procedures prescribed in Articles 39 or 43 of the Constitution.

### Legislative Yuan to Hold Preparatory Meeting Today; Attendance of Committee Members Expected to Exceed Half of Total; Issues of Elected Representatives from the Democratic and Youth Parties Still Under Negotiation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] As of the 9th, 440 Legislative Yuan members have registered. It is expected that the first preparatory meeting on the 10th will have more than half of the total number of members in attendance. The primary issue will be to decide on the person to chair the preparatory meeting.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 9th] Six Legislative Yuan members from Hubei Province and Wuhan City, including Yu Zheng and Li Jianting, took a bus to Nanjing today to attend the meeting.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] A person in charge of the Central Party Headquarters stated: The Kuomintang Central Committee has decided to nominate Sun Ke and Chen Lifu as candidates for the positions of President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan. Kuomintang Legislative Yuan members must obey the Party's decision, which means assisting in their election. The rumor that Chen Lifu's campaign committee was established on the 8th is purely groundless.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Discussions regarding the issue of elected Legislative Yuan members from the Democratic and Youth Parties continued today, the 9th, with Lei Zhen separately visiting people from both parties for consultations. No concrete conclusion was reached. However, people from both parties will go to Shanghai within the next two days to hold a meeting and make a decision.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mo Dehui has been in contact with the leaders of the Democratic and Youth Parties since yesterday to help resolve the stalemate over the number of Legislative Yuan seats. At noon, Mo was invited to a banquet by Zhang Junmai and went to Fan Garden to discuss the matter for more than two hours. Around 3:00 PM, Li Huang visited Mo at Zhongshan Hospital for a lengthy conversation. Mo kept the content of the meeting secret but stated, "The solution still lies within the Legislative Yuan, not outside it, because Zhang Junmai values the Legislative Yuan the most." He also said, "Just a little effort is needed, and a solution will surely be found."

[Report from the Central News Agency in This City] Government Commissioners Mo Dehui and Xu Kan, the Director of the National Government's Budget, came to Shanghai to mediate the issue of the elected Legislative Yuan members from the Democratic and Youth Parties. At noon on the 9th, the two had lunch with Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party. In the afternoon, Li Huang of the Youth Party visited Mo. They held separate consultations on this issue. It is reported that the attitude of both parties is very firm. They are unwilling to consider anything other than half of the Legislative Yuan seats for the two parties, and the other half to be resolved by other means, which has led to this stalemate with no progress.

### Remarkable Achievements of the National Assembly Praised by Hu Shi

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] Hu Shi flew back to Beiping this afternoon and met with reporters, praising the achievements of the National Assembly, saying that its success was beyond his expectations.

Although the external control that was rumored could not be said to be completely non-existent, it was ineffective because the election was by secret ballot, unlike the National Assembly of the Soviet Union, where 99% were controlled. Hu also said that alumni of Shanghai Great China University have donated 5 billion yuan to rebuild the Jie Min Memorial Hall.

### Japanese Reparations Goods to be Fully Transported by Mid-Month

To Be Allocated to Private Factories

[Report from Our Newspaper] It is reported that all Japanese reparations goods will be fully shipped to Shanghai by the middle of this month. As of now, a total of 596 pieces and 517 units of reparations goods for private enterprises, totaling 1,388,069 tons, have been shipped to this city and are stored in the No. 7 Wharf warehouse of the China Merchants Bureau in Pudong, under the custody of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office. In addition, there are 286 pieces of Japanese reparations goods transported by the "Changli" and 311 pieces of goods transported by the "Limin," which are currently being unloaded. According to the current reparations goods that have arrived, there are no complete sets of equipment, but rather small-scale working machines and engines, which are greatly needed by general industries. Therefore, there are many applicants, with the total exceeding three times the amount of goods that have arrived. In the past, the allocation work was delayed due to the decision on preferential measures for rear-area reconstruction factories. It is now known that the Executive Yuan officially decided on preferential measures yesterday, and it is expected that the Ministry of Economic Affairs' appraisal committee will begin work soon. When the reparations goods arrived, experts from the Allied Headquarters had already provided valuation sheets. However, in order to be cautious, our side will refer to these valuation sheets and re-evaluate the goods based on their quality and age before allocating them to private factories.

### Ministry of Interior Cables Provincial Governments to Effectively Handle Conscription; Second Term Enlisted Youth Division to Extend Service by Two Years

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Ministry of Interior recently cabled various provincial governments, stating that according to reports from the Ministry of National Defense, many personnel handling conscription affairs in various regions have failed to comply with laws and regulations to handle matters practically. The central government has detailed and specific regulations regarding conscription matters. If all parties cooperate effectively, especially township officials below the county level, there will definitely be no corruption. At this time of national crisis, the replenishment of soldiers is extremely important. All levels of conscription personnel should abide by regulations and handle matters practically. Those who commit illegal and corrupt acts will be punished according to the law as a warning to others, thereby benefiting conscription.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] In order to cultivate and educate military officers, the Reserve Cadre Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense has specially stipulated that the second term enlisted youth division across the country will have their service extended by two years. The key points of attention are: (1) To enable all our young officers and soldiers to fully understand the significance of the extended service, increase their enthusiasm for serving, and promptly launch extended service propaganda based on actual needs and timeliness. (2) To emphasize spiritual education, prioritize national consciousness and a sense of responsibility, and second personal gains and losses, in order to establish a theoretical foundation for extended service. (3) The company commander and deputy commanders should have individual talks with outstanding soldiers in their company to increase their understanding and play a exemplary leadership role. In addition, after the expiration of the extended service, their reemployment preferential treatment measures will still include opportunities for priority employment, schooling, and participation in civil service examinations, as in the first term.

### Political Affairs Symposium of Pacification Zones Continues in Nanjing Yesterday; Wang Fenggang Reports on Bandit Suppression in Ji

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Political Affairs Symposium of Pacification Zones continued on the morning of the 9th. Wang Fenggang, Commissioner of the Tenth District of Ji, reported on the bandit suppression situation in the district. Wang explained the coordination and application of the party, government, and military, as well as bandit suppression tactics, based on his bandit suppression experience. The session lasted for three hours, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The afternoon session was adjourned, and the meeting is scheduled to continue on the morning of the 10th. In the afternoon of the 9th, Wang also went to National Chengchi University at the university's request to report on the recent situation of bandit suppression in the Pingjinbao triangle area.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Wang Fenggang reported on his experience in bandit suppression in the Tenth District and the joint efforts of the military and civilians in annihilating communist bandits at the request of the Ji Youth Progressive Association on the evening of the 9th. Wang first described the various atrocities of the communist bandits in Ji Province, saying that they have aroused the hatred of all the people. He then explained the reasons for the development of the communist bandits in Ji Province, one being that they used guerrilla tactics to gain the initiative, and the other being that our politics could not be coordinated with the military. Everything was done simply by following orders, and politics could not be integrated with the people. Finally, Wang analyzed the bandit suppression measures he took in the Tenth District. On the military side, they did not defend strongholds but adopted guerrilla tactics. On the political side, they absolutely integrated with the people, sharing their joys and sorrows. In the past year, the communist bandits in the six counties of the Tenth District have been eliminated. The Tenth District has a total of 7,000 troops with over 3,500 rifles, but the communist bandits often attacked with a force of 20,000. As a result, they all failed. The people of the Tenth District have all spontaneously mobilized to assist the government in suppressing the communist bandits. When it is absolutely necessary to retreat, they all empty the houses and clear the fields, making it impossible for the bandits to survive in the area. If the people cannot escape, they adopt a non-cooperative attitude, answering "I don't know" to any questions asked by the bandits. Therefore, the communist bandits have never been able to survive in the Tenth District. There are now no traces of bandits in the area.

### Shaanxi and Gansu National Army Launch Fierce Joint Attack; More Than Half of the Bandits in Eastern Gansu Annihilated; Battle for Dengxian Reaches a Tragic Stage

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch, 8th] According to a certain military authority, the communist bandits launched an army of more than 60,000, attempting to flee to the Shaanxi-Gansu border. After repeated ambushes by our army, they suffered 40,000 casualties. The bandit forces were frustrated and then led more than 20,000 remnants back to northern Shaanxi via eastern Gansu. Bandit leaders Peng Dehuai and Wang Zhen personally commanded in eastern Gansu, fleeing in disarray, forcibly threatening villagers and looting cloth, grain, etc. However, under the close contact and fierce joint attack of the Shaanxi and Gansu National Army, even if they achieved their goal of breaking through and escaping back to northern Shaanxi, very few would remain. Currently, the main force of Peng's bandits in the Haichuan area has been ambushed by our northern and southern armies, resulting in a large number of beheadings. Bandit corpses and abandoned items are scattered all over the ground. Local teams in eastern Gansu have also bravely blocked the attack, and the people have risen to respond, so great achievements have been made in recent weeks.

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 9th] Zhengyang was relieved yesterday. According to accurate estimates, the bandits who besieged the city included the independent brigades of Wei Fenlou and Jin Shaoshan, and parts of Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi's forces, totaling 40,000 people. Liu and Chen's bandit forces were responsible for commanding and covering the attack, while Wei and Jin's bandits attacked the city, attempting to capture Zhengyang and take Xinyang directly via Lu. However, our defending forces, with only two battalions, firmly defended the city, preventing the bandits from crossing the Lei Pool. The remnants fled to Runan.

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 9th] In the Zhengyang battle, the bandits suffered more than 2,000 casualties, and one brigade commander was killed. We suffered only over 60 casualties.

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 9th] The fierce battle in Dengxian has reached its most tragic stage on the 8th. Our defending forces, with over 4,000 people, are determined to coexist with the city with the greatest sacrifice. It is heard that air force squadrons will fly to provide aerial support, and the bandits will not be difficult to defeat.

[Report from the Central News Agency, Hankou, 8th] The Air Force base here has been providing full support to the National Army defending the inner city of Dengxian all day, and has dropped a large number of grain and ammunition for supply. The morale of the defending forces is extremely high with the assistance of our planes. There are many bandits hiding in the outer city of Dengxian, and there are bandit fortifications all around the inner city. There are also several anti-aircraft machine gun positions, and there are two bandit pontoon bridges on the northwest river. After fierce bombing by our air force all day, the bandit army suffered heavy casualties, and most of the fortifications were destroyed.

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 9th] The teams defending Xiangchuan suffered heavy casualties and automatically moved to new positions on the evening of the 7th.

[Report from the Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th] The National Army that advanced to attack Mi County reached the vicinity of Mi County City at dusk on the 8th.

[Report from the Central News Agency, Xi'an, 8th] After defeating the attacking bandits, the Lingbao Self-Defense Team in western Henan has been pursuing the remnants to the east for days, seizing many trophies.

Editorial

### Warning Sign of Japan's Re-armament!

The American policy of supporting Japan's reconstruction has advanced from economic assistance to military assistance. The "Maritime Safety Agency," established in Tokyo on May 1st, with Takeo Okubo as its director, and maritime offices set up in Yokosuka, Niigata, Nagoya, and other places, possesses 8,000 armed personnel and 38 security and surveillance ships that patrol Japanese territorial waters in rotation. This is a measure recently specially approved by MacArthur, without going through the Far Eastern Commission and the Control Council for Japan, to revive Japan's naval forces. Although American officials have stated that the Maritime Safety Agency is not actually armed, the Allied Headquarters' measures are too lacking in careful consideration. It will shock the world, causing people to be alarmed, feeling that this is a warning sign of Japan's re-armament!

Since Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration's unconditional surrender, all armed organizations have been dissolved, and the Ministries of the Army and Navy and the Air Force have also been formally abolished. However, the equipment and machinery of the army and navy have been completely preserved and not disposed of, so they can be rebuilt at any time. In recent years, Japanese underground organizations have been working hard to carry out clandestine activities, attempting to restore their armed forces. Last May, an official of the Japanese Foreign Ministry requested the establishment of an army of 100,000 men after the termination of the Allied occupation, to test the attitude of the Allied countries. At that time, due to the opposition of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union, the Allied Headquarters informally rejected Japan's request. However, the Allied Headquarters allowed Japan to maintain a small number of armed police, and any other manifestation that could become re-armament would not be considered until a peace treaty was concluded. But only a year has passed since this matter, and the Allied Headquarters has approved the establishment of the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency, and it is even heard that MacArthur intends to allow the Agency to expand its armed personnel from 8,000 to 10,000 in the near future, and to increase the strength of its fleet from 38 to 135 ships. This is tantamount to allowing Japan to rebuild its maritime armed forces and gradually prepare to restore the Ministry of the Navy. Whatever the reason for this measure, it is a threat to the Pacific nations, and we should all oppose it and effectively prevent the development of Japan's re-armament.

(1) The establishment of the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency is a new threat to the countries along the Pacific coast. The Allied Headquarters' permission for Japan to restore its maritime armed forces this time is based on the reason that it is necessary to take stern action with maritime police to prevent Koreans from illegally entering Japan for smuggling. The Japanese government uses the illegal activities of Koreans as an excuse, and even expands the actions of Osaka City to repel Koreans, in an attempt to increase the strength of the police. In fact, Japan's existing police force is sufficient to prevent smuggling and suppress any activities of Korean smugglers. As far as we know, Koreans do not engage in large-scale smuggling activities in Japanese territorial waters. On the contrary, Japanese smuggling organizations still exist, and smuggling activities have penetrated into Taiwan, Fujian, Hong Kong, and other places. Therefore, Japan's establishment of the Maritime Safety Agency under the pretext of stopping Korean smuggling is a deception, and the real purpose is to rebuild Japan's maritime armed forces and pose a new threat to the Pacific nations.

(2) The reconstruction of Japan's maritime armed forces carries the crisis of the rebuilding of the Japanese navy. The development of this situation is contrary to the spirit of the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration, and even violates the decision of the Far Eastern Commission on the basic policy towards Japan. The Cairo Declaration of November 22, 1943, stated that "the purpose of the three great Allied Powers in waging this war is to restrain and punish Japan's aggression"; the purpose of restraining Japan's aggression is to disarm it materially and immaterially, and to punish its aggressors who use armed forces, in order to eliminate war and prevent it from occurring in future space and time. The Potsdam Declaration of July 26, 1945, listed "We insist that militarism responsible for the war must be driven from the world; the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the people of Japan into embarking on world conquest must be eliminated permanently," and "until there is convincing proof that Japan's war-making power is destroyed," therefore the Allied countries demanded that the Japanese government "immediately proclaim the unconditional surrender of all armed forces and provide proper guarantees of its good faith in such action." Because the Allied countries wanted to obtain evidence that Japan had destroyed its war-making and disarmament forces, the Control Council for Japan and the Allied Headquarters were established to supervise Japan's implementation of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration. Unexpectedly, the Potsdam Declaration has not yet been thoroughly implemented, but the occupying forces have allowed the restoration of Japanese armed forces, which is tantamount to destroying the sacred basis of the Potsdam Declaration. At the meeting of the Control Council for Japan on April 28, the American representative, Mr. Sheppard, submitted the case of the establishment of the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency for discussion. Representatives from China, Britain, and the Soviet Union all opposed it. The Soviet representative hoped that the case would be implemented after the decision of the Far Eastern Commission, which is a very reasonable proposal. The Far Eastern Commission is the highest decision-maker for the Allied policy towards Japan. According to the basic policy towards Japan promulgated by the Far Eastern Commission on June 20, 1947, "Disarmament and demilitarization are the initial tasks of military occupation and should be completed quickly and decisively." MacArthur's measure, in not submitting it to the Far Eastern Commission, is because his arbitrariness actually violates the policy decisions of the Far Eastern Commission.

(3) Before a peace treaty with Japan is concluded and the compensation problem is resolved, Japan's use of ships and equipment to rebuild its maritime armed forces will affect the compensation for Allied merchant ships, and may even result in no compensation at all. Among the Pacific coastal countries that fought against Japan, the greatest ship losses were suffered by China, followed by the Philippines, Australia, Britain, and the Netherlands. The United States believes that Japan should have between two and three million tons of merchant ships, while our country believes that half of this is sufficient, and the issue of compensation for merchant ship tonnage has not yet been resolved. Now that Japan has established the Maritime Safety Agency, the warships it holds, each of which is hundreds of tons and can travel at 20 nautical miles per hour, are all items of compensation that the Allied countries want to acquire.

From the above explanations, we know that the Allied Headquarters' unilateral measures not only further help Japan to revive its maritime armed forces, which is contrary to the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Declaration, and the Far Eastern Commission's policy towards Japan, but also damages the compensation for the Allied countries' ship equipment. This is such a major event! I hope that our government and the countries along the Pacific coast will quickly seek effective countermeasures and prevent Japan's attempt to rearm!

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The annular solar eclipse phenomenon this morning, which the people of the whole country were interested in, according to the Central Meteorological Observatory, has obviously been frustrated by the universal overcast and rainy weather in various places, and everyone was greatly disappointed that they could not witness it. There was overcast and rainy weather in Nanjing this morning. From 8 o'clock, light rain fell, and the solar eclipse could not be observed. The informal observation prepared by the Tianwen [astronomical] Institute (and the Surveying Bureau) at Zijin Mountain was cancelled. However, at around 10:50 a.m., the sky was abnormally dark, the only reminder to the citizens that it was the time of maximum eclipse.

[Our report] This city had an unremarkable solar eclipse phenomenon yesterday morning due to haze and clouds. After 9:30, the sky became dark, like when it is overcast and raining. By 10:15, it was as dark as dusk, and many homes and shops had turned on their lights. Five minutes later, the darkness became even more severe, resembling the moment before a summer thunderstorm, with a cool breeze blowing and a chill in the air. The sound of firecrackers rose from the streets, and many people on high buildings and balconies looked up at the solar eclipse, but due to the low clouds, nothing could be seen. After 11 o'clock, it gradually became brighter, and at 11:15, the eclipsed sun, narrow like a new moon, could be seen in the clouds. At 12:15 noon, it returned to normal.

[Our report, Hangzhou, 9th] For today's annular solar eclipse, the surveying team jointly formed by the American Geographical Society and the military department, and the observation team jointly formed by the Astronomical Institute of the Academia Sinica and the Surveying Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, observed the solar eclipse at the Cibiwu of Yuhang, 43 kilometers northwest of Hangzhou. The former's station was located at Dongwu Gang Peak at 119 degrees 50 minutes 44 seconds east longitude, 30 degrees 26 minutes 25 seconds north latitude, and 260 meters above sea level, presided over by Father Hayden of the United States and Zhang Yuzhe, Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academia Sinica, and Kastrin, planning to take films and engage in geodetic surveying; the latter was on a hillside at 119 degrees 50 minutes 30 seconds east longitude and 30 degrees 26 minutes 10 seconds north latitude, presided over by Chen Zunyi, Shi Yao, Xia Jianbai, and other nine people, and their work was to determine the time of contact, take the beginning and end of the changes in the solar eclipse phenomenon, and measure the change in solar luminosity during the solar eclipse. From 4:00 to 6:30 this morning, there was light rain, and after the rain, there were dense clouds. The American team could not work, and the Chinese team could only use the electrical equipment of the Physics Department of Central University to measure the luminosity, recording it every five minutes half an hour before and after the first contact, and every minute between the front and back five minutes

### Successfully Filmed Spectrums; Qingdao Observation Work Achieved Satisfactory Results

[Our report, Qingdao, 9th] Today, the city's sky was completely covered by high-altitude clouds. The trace of the solar disk was not seen during the first contact of the solar eclipse, and the observation work could not be carried out. Forty scientific workers were also filled with sorrow, but the high-altitude ionosphere test could still be carried out, and the radio waves emitted from Tokyo and other places were significantly reduced. During the recovery process, the cloud layer thinned, and the solar disk was like a light veil, occasionally revealing its full appearance. The observers seized this once-in-a-millennium opportunity and achieved considerable satisfactory results. Among them, the spectrum filming was the most successful. The purpose of this test was to hope to discover the existence of new elements. According to Wang Huawen, the leader of the Observatory, the observation results can be calculated clearly. According to calculations, the recovery time was 12:29:03.1, and the observation was 12:28:36.5, a difference of 27.9 seconds. The clock interval was recorded every minute, and every half minute between the two minutes before and after. As a result, the first contact was measured at 9:30:27.14, the maximum eclipse was at 10:49:25 to 32 seconds, reaching 7 seconds, and the recovery was at 12:18:11, which was consistent with the prediction. At the darkest time of the maximum eclipse, the ratio of luminosity to that before the first contact was 500 to 1.

[Our report, Taipei, 9th] This morning, the sky in Taipei was overcast with intermittent light rain, making it impossible to precisely measure the time of the initial eclipse. It was not until 9:40:30 that the sun's upper right side was seen to be deficient by 19%. At 10:04, it reached 46%. After that, the sun was covered by clouds. At 10:40:24, the maximum eclipse occurred, with the sun's lower left side deficient by about 86%. By 12:09:42, it was restored. During the maximum eclipse, the sky was like dusk, and there was a slight drizzle, which, according to the Meteorological Institute's analysis, seemed to be affected by the solar eclipse. The Institute also announced the impact of the solar eclipse on temperature. The temperature reading at the initial eclipse was 21.1 degrees, and at the maximum eclipse, it was 21.7 degrees, and the difference between the rise compared to the reading at the same time on the 8th was 3 degrees, so the temperature rise on the 9th was only one-fifth of the temperature rise value on the 8th. As for the effect on horizontal solar radiation, it was 14.1 gram-calories per square centimeter per minute at the initial eclipse, decreasing to 7.6 gram-calories at the maximum eclipse, then further decreasing to 4.6 gram-calories at 11:15, and rising to 25.7 gram-calories at recovery. Regarding the geomagnetic effect, the deviation value increased by one minute at the initial eclipse and recovery, and decreased by one minute at the maximum eclipse. As for the effect on atmospheric electricity, it was positive before the initial eclipse, negative 19 V/M after the initial eclipse, negative 1 V/M at the maximum eclipse, and negative 5 V/M at recovery, before quickly trending towards a positive value. This solar eclipse attracted 3,000 people to the Taiwan Observatory.

[Our report, Chongqing, 9th] Dr. Feng Jian, who observed the impact of the solar eclipse on the ionosphere, did not sleep all night yesterday. This morning, he accompanied reporters to visit the precise underground equipment of the International Broadcasting Station. More than 20 staff members were buried in calculations, and broadcast the records of the Chung-Chong total radio waves at any time. Although it was overcast and rainy today, it did not affect the observation. The initial famine was at 7:22 according to the Shu-Long standard time, the maximum eclipse was at 8:32, and the recovery was at 9:51. He had already established ionosphere observation stations all over the country. The results will only be revealed after the records from Chung-Hui Island and various stations are sent to Chongqing for compilation and precise calculation.

### Observations Clear in Peiping and Amoy

[Our report, Peiping, 9th] The partial solar eclipse was observed very clearly in Peiping today. The first contact of the solar eclipse started at 9:40 a.m. from the lower right, reaching 77% at 11:04 at the maximum eclipse, and recovering at 12:00, lasting for one hour and thirty-three minutes. There were many clouds in the sky before and after the solar eclipse, so citizens could also see it with the naked eye. The Peiping Broadcasting Administration and the American observation team cooperated to transmit radio waves from the Peiping Radio Station to Japan starting from the 8th to study the impact of the solar eclipse on radio waves.

[Our report, Amoy, 9th] The weather was clear here today, and the entire solar eclipse was visible. The partial eclipse began at 9:20, forming an arc shape. At 9:50, the sunlight suddenly dimmed, as if it were dusk. Citizens stood on the terrace to observe with dark mirrors, only seeing an eyebrow shape. At 10:30, the light returned, and at 11:20, it returned to its original state.

### Observation Team Achieves Success on Rebun Island, Northern Japan; "Night Sky" Filled with Stars

[Central News Agency, Rebun Island, Northern Japan, 9th, Associated Press] A sudden turn in the weather allowed the sun to finally appear in the minutes before the final minute scientists had hoped for, allowing the American and Japanese scientist team to achieve obvious success. Rebun Island became a world of darkness when totality arrived, with only a full moon suspended in the air. Scientists then busied themselves with various instruments to record what occurred. If observations elsewhere are as successful, the recordings from here can provide important data for determining the size of the Earth. In the blink of an eye of totality, the entire island was immersed in a crimson light, with a halo around the moon. The "night sky" was filled with stars. The time of totality today was 11:50:36 a.m. Japanese Standard Time (Greenwich Mean Time).

[Associated Press, Manila, 9th] The solar eclipse began here at 8:05 a.m. today. By 9:18, two-thirds of the sun's surface was obscured by the moon. The sky was clear today, perfect for observation. The Astronomical Group of the Philippine Meteorological Bureau busied themselves with two special cameras, taking photos of the solar eclipse in progress. At the apex of the solar eclipse, the sun circled the moon to become a halo, after which it gradually returned to its original state, and the solar eclipse was completed at 10:41. According to US Air Force personnel, the darkest part of the moon's shadow seen on Earth was five miles short. Only by flying to an altitude of 26,000 feet could one see its full appearance.

### Amid an Atmosphere of Riots, Arson, and Assassination: South Korea Holds its First Popular Election; 6 Million Armed Troops on Alert

[Reuters, Seoul, 9th] On the eve of Korea's first popular election in 4,000 years, riots are widespread south of the 38th parallel. 60,000 armed police and 1 million volunteer militia members are stationed in cities, towns, and villages to protect candidates, voters, election officials, and polling stations, but they cannot completely quell the flames of the riots. Moreover, the Pyongyang radio station, controlled by the Soviet Union, broadcasts to the South Korean people all day long, urging them to prevent the election from taking place by various means. Secret documents in Russian and Korean, seized by the authorities, detail North Korea's orchestrated violent anti-terrorism plans, and it is expected that the atmosphere of terror will reach its peak on Monday, the day voting begins. Reports pouring into South Korean police stations are filled with news of assassinations, arson, and sabotage of railroads and telegraphic communications. This morning, another right-wing candidate was assassinated, making him the sixth victim among the candidates. Furthermore, three trains were derailed due to sabotage. In the inland city of Taegu (transliteration), a gun battle broke out between left- and right-wing elements, resulting in two deaths on each side. A delayed report states that when left-wing elements on Geomun Island took action, four were killed by the police. A strict curfew is in effect throughout South Korea on the night of the 9th, and the U.S. Army has been ordered to be ready to mobilize within half an hour if necessary. All Korean political parties and groups participating in the general election agree that establishing a Korean government is the first step towards independence, with the only opposition coming from the Communist Party. Some right-wing minority parties believe that the election cannot be held at present. The powers of the assembly include enacting laws and electing the president and prime minister. One hundred seats in the assembly will be reserved for North Korean participation. The final results of the election are not expected to be revealed until Wednesday evening or Thursday morning. The number of people who actually vote is of most interest to the general public. The Communist Party, under North Korea's command, will refuse to vote. There are a total of 8 million eligible voters in South Korea, with approximately 7 million registered. American observers predict that if the actual number of voters reaches half of the registered voters, it will be equivalent to a victory for the Communist Party. A curfew has been imposed in Seoul starting tonight. The streets are deserted at night, with only armed police and volunteer self-defense teams patrolling. Starting from the 9th, officials in charge of occupying the Chang Bureau have been ordered to avoid participating in all Korean gatherings and not to linger on the streets. The U.S. authorities' directive points out that this period will be the most critical since the occupation of Korea. In Seoul alone, starting at dawn on Monday, 7,000 armed police officers, 1,500 special guards, and 9,000 self-defense team members will be on guard. Nearly one in four able-bodied men in South Korea is participating in the self-defense teams, but the U.S. authorities are not certain that Seoul can maintain order. Korean police say that large quantities of weapons have been secretly transported from North Korea via land and sea routes to South Korea in recent days to supply terrorists. Secret orders were found on several arrested leaders of the South Korean Labor Party (Communist Party), instructing them to set fire as a signal for an attack, and to attack polling stations with "Molotov cocktails" disguised as voters infiltrating the polling stations. United Nations polling supervisors, under strict protection, have left Seoul for the countryside. From 5:00 PM on Friday to 3:00 PM on the 9th, a total of 39 people were assassinated, 14 were injured, 6 were missing, 133 were arrested, 24 train engines were destroyed, over 6,000 ballots were destroyed, and a total of 60 sabotage incidents occurred.

### Syngman Rhee, the Most Popular Candidate for the First President of the New Korean Government, Declares He Will Demand the Withdrawal of Soviet Troops from Korea

[Taiwanese Mass News Agency, Seoul, 9th] According to United Nations regulations, the first president of Korea will likely be Dr. Syngman Rhee. Mr. Rhee holds anti-communist views. During a journalist interview, he stated: "If I organize a new government, the first thing I will do is organize a South Korean defense force. Then, I will order the communist People's Army of North Korea to abandon the Soviet Union and come over to us."

Mr. Rhee believes that the North Korean army will certainly come over to the South. Americans do not all think that way. However, they also deeply believe that regardless of what kind of government is formed after the South Korean election, its first leader will undoubtedly be Mr. Rhee. Mr. Rhee, a graduate of Harvard University, told reporters over tea: "Once we have a government recognized by all countries, we will demand that the Soviet Union get out of Korea and that the United States remain." However, he did not specify what measures would be taken if the Soviet Union refused to withdraw.

[Our Report] Last month, on the 18th, a young couple checked into the Wuzhou Hotel, located at Nos. 2-4, Lane 517, Yidong Road and Hubei Road, in Tongting Lane. They stayed in Room No. 9 on the ground floor. The man, said to be named Yu Xingbo, 21 years old, from Haimen, was wearing a blue cloth jacket, a Western-style shirt and socks, and khaki Western-style pants. He referred to the woman as his wife, Shen, 17 years old, also from Haimen. The woman was wearing a floral print cheongsam and black leather shoes. She seemed generous and told people at the hotel that she had come to Shanghai to study.

On the evening of the 6th of this month, Yu left the hotel and never returned. The waiters, seeing that they had stayed for many days and left their luggage behind, were unconcerned and did not suspect anything amiss. It was not until yesterday afternoon at around 1 p.m. that a waiter, Mr. Qi (from Wuxi), opened the door to the room to clean it. He noticed a strange smell that made him want to vomit. He looked around the bed and saw nothing, but the bedding was neat and the tables, chairs, and tea tables were in their usual places. However, he discovered that one of the hotel's quilts was missing. Looking under the bed, he found a large package. Realizing something was wrong, he immediately reported it to the front desk and called for his colleagues to help drag the heavy object out. They unwrapped the outer layer of burlap, and inside was a red quilt from the hotel. Continuing to unwrap it, they were shocked to find a female corpse. Upon closer inspection, they recognized her as the female guest who had said she was coming to Shanghai to study. The corpse was wearing a red floral print blouse, and the lower half of her body was naked. The quilt was covered in bloodstains, which had turned purplish-black due to the passage of several days.

The hotel authorities immediately reported the incident to the Old Zhabei Police Branch. Upon receiving the report, Deputy Branch Chief Yan immediately ordered Criminal Division Chief Jiang Shangpei to oversee the division and Zhang Huaidong, Zhong Youlin, and other officers to rush to the scene to investigate. At the same time, the Criminal Division of the City Police Bureau dispatched Deputy Division Chief Ma Feiji and police officers to the scene to take photographs of the corpse. It was also discovered that the female corpse had three stab wounds to the head, one stab wound to the right forearm, and bruising on the buttocks. The body was transported to Renji Hospital and then to the morgue for an autopsy. Meanwhile, officers from the police bureau continued to search the room and later found a kitchen knife under the wash basin. The knife was stained with blood, and it was taken back to the police station for safekeeping. Although the cause of the woman's death is not yet clear, it is certain that the murderer must have been the male guest who came with her. The Old Zhabei Police Bureau is currently in pursuit.

### Another Amazing Record at the National Games: Qi Peilin's Discus Throw Reaches 41.55 Meters; New Harvests Expected in Today's 10,000-Meter Final; A Hundred-Section Long Snake Wriggles on Jiangwan Road; Crowds at the Stadium Reach a Frenzy

[Our Dispatch] The wind and rain came last night. If it clears today, all competitions, except for men's and women's tennis and men's table tennis, will enter the round-robin stage. The track and field finals are also on the last day. The 10,000-meter final, in which the silent long-distance running hero Lou Wen'ao will participate, is sure to be a highlight today. According to the organizing committee, if there is torrential rain, the various programs will be decided on an ad hoc basis. However, indoor competitions will proceed as usual regardless of the weather.

Yesterday was the fifth day of the Games and a regular Sunday. The morning sun was gentle, the air was crisp, and the wind was mild. The citizens and cars of Shanghai almost knocked each other down to rush to the following three locations: the city center, Hongqiao Airport, and Yiyuan.

At the main venue of the Games: Jiangwan. On the 美路, all kinds of vehicles were connected from east to west. At the most congested times, traffic moved slowly at a speed of ten miles per hour, like a wriggling hundred-section snake. The track and field stadium, basketball courts, tennis courts, gymnasium, and even the swimming pool, which had no programs scheduled, were packed with spectators. The cultural street in front of the West Commander's Platform was particularly crowded. According to preliminary estimates, there were more than 150,000 spectators. The atmosphere was boiling, reaching a frenzy. The grandstand of the track and field stadium was so swollen that three or four thousand spectators jumped into the field. The order inside the venue was chaotic, and the competition was once suspended. The entire security team worked tirelessly throughout the day and made extraordinary efforts to prevent accidents, which is commendable.

At Hongqiao Airport: 70 paratroopers gave China's first parachute performance. There were more than 100,000 spectators. More than 3,000 cars blocked all traffic on Hongqiao Road. At Yiyuan: there were two soccer semi-final matches, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. More than 50,000 soccer fans gathered outside the venue, a sea of heads.

The men's discus was the rich harvest of yesterday. The champion and runner-up broke the national record with 41.55 meters and 41.155 meters, respectively. The third place also broke the Games record.

Men's Track and Field Score Statistics: Taiwan added another six points, totaling 111.5 points, and already holds the championship. There was no change in the other rankings: Air Force 47, Shanghai 41, Navy 34. In women's track and field, Hebei still leads, adding one point to 26. Beiping is second with 23 points. Qingdao and Taiwan are closely following behind with 16 points each and will pose a threat to Hebei.

In the men's basketball semi-finals, the Joint Logistics Command defeated Tianjin in a close battle for the right to the final four. In the other matches, Filipino-Chinese defeated the Air Force, the Police defeated Shenyang, Shanghai defeated the Navy, and the situation was one-sided.

In the four soccer semi-final matches, Hong Kong defeated Zhejiang with considerable effort. The Army defeated Malaya almost by chance. The Police defeated 邏羅平平淡淡. Dalian lost to Shanghai and vented their anger on the referee, resorting to violence, which is truly "shameful" and "regrettable"!

### Remarkable Men's Discus Performance: First and Second Place Break National Records, Third Place Also Sets Games Record; Chen Biying of the Women's Long Jump Wins the Championship with a Tight Last Jump

The women's long jump results were average. The competition details are as follows:

Men's Discus: 51 athletes registered, but only 30 actually participated. The throwing began at about 2:00 PM. Before long, spectators rushed onto the field, causing great chaos. The competition was suspended once. After order was restored, the throwing resumed. In the three preliminary throws, only ten people exceeded 30 meters. Qi Peilin of Tianjin, the champion of the shot put, suddenly exceeded the national record mark in his last throw of the preliminary round. Upon measurement, it was 41.55 meters, leading the pack with this result. Wang Rui of the Air Force, whose highest result in the preliminary round was 39.16 meters, was depressed. In the final stage, each throw improved, and the last throw actually exceeded the national record mark, causing Lao Qi to break into a cold sweat. Upon measurement, it was 41.155 meters, placing second. Liu Jing of Taiwan placed third. The old national record holder, Guo Jianzhang (Guo Jie) of Liaoning, was old and past his prime, only getting 35.675 meters, placing fourth. The results of the major rankings are as follows:

(1) Qi Peilin (Tianjin) 41.55 meters
(2) Wang Rui (Air Force) 41.155 meters
(3) Liu Jing (Taiwan) 38.54 meters
(4) Guo Jianzhang (Liaoning) 35.675 meters
(5) Yu Zongxiong (Taiwan) 33.98 meters
(6) Wu Zhenwu (Navy) 33.83 meters

Women's Long Jump: No fewer than 30 people participated in the long jump. After a long melee, only eight people exceeded four meters. In the preliminary round, Chen Ruinian of Qingdao took the lead with 4.6儿5 meters on her first jump. Ms. Chen's jumping posture was excellent, but her subsequent jumps showed slight fatigue, and the results failed to improve. Chen Biying of Fujian had the highest hopes of winning the championship, but her results in the preliminary round yesterday were not outstanding. In the final stage, she gritted her teeth on her last jump and used all her strength, finally getting 4.83 meters, overwhelming Little Chen of Qingdao in one fell swoop. Except for Zhang Ganmei of Taiwan, who made slight progress in the final round, the other athletes made no progress. The final ranking results are as follows:

(1) Chen Biying (Fujian) 4.83 meters
(2) Chen Ruinian (Qingdao) 4.695 meters
(3) Wu Shuying (Fujian) 4.47 meters
(4) Zhang Ganmei (Taiwan) 4.39 meters
(5) Lin Zhenji (Beijing) 4.34 meters
(6) Zhao Hong (Hebei) 4.19 meters

### Men's and Women's Track and Field Preliminary and Quarterfinals: Yu Xiwei Leads in the 800 Meters; Huang Liangzheng is First in the Intermediate Hurdles; Wang Shugui Wins the 60 Meters; Chen Biying is Best in the 200 Meters

Yesterday, all of the men's and women's track and field events were preliminary and quarterfinal rounds. For the men's group, the preliminary rounds were for the 800 meters and 1600-meter relay. The quarterfinal rounds were for the 200 meters and intermediate hurdles. For the women's group, the preliminary rounds were for the 60 meters and 400-meter relay. The quarterfinal rounds were for the 60 meters and 200 meters.

In the men's preliminary round, the 800 meters was held in three groups. Veteran Yu Xiwei won the first group of the third group with a time of 2 minutes 8.7 seconds, which was the best of the three groups. He won very easily, leaving the second place about ten meters behind. The first place in the other two groups were Li Linglong of Liaoning and Song Wenjian of Qingdao. Chen Yinglang of Taiwan registered but did not participate. Twelve finalists will compete today. The 1600-meter relay race was held while it was already raining and was completed in the rain. The results were average. The Taiwan team was one of the best groups in the three groups, also reaching 3 minutes 43.6 seconds. It is hoped that they can improve in today's final. The intermediate hurdles quarterfinals were divided into three groups. The first group of Huang Liangzheng of Malaya still had the best result, 59.4 seconds, not far from the Games record of 59.0 seconds. The other two groups were all above 60 seconds. There is no question that Huang Liangzheng will win both hurdles championships. In the 200-meter quarterfinals, the best performers in the secondary competition the day before were all selected. This event was also held in the rain, so the result of 23.6 seconds was just average. In today's final, Rong Chengbiao of Shanghai and the Taiwan athletes will have a fierce battle.

In the women's preliminary round, the 60 meters was held in eight groups. The results of the two groups of Wang Shugui of Qingdao and Li Xinyi of Chongqing were both 8.6 seconds, while the others even exceeded 9 seconds. In the quarterfinals, Wang Shugui shortened it by another tenth of a second, winning the first group of the second group with 8.5 seconds. In today's final, the female generals who won the 100-meter race the day before, Wang Shugui, Li Xinyi, Guo Meili, and Li Xiaobi, will compete again. It seems that Wang Shugui can steadily win another championship. After winning the long jump championship, Chen Biying of Fujian competed in the 200-meter quarterfinals, 29.2 seconds, the best result. The other finalists were still Wang Shugui, Li Xinyi, Li Xiaojiong, Mei Shunyan, and others. However, the result of more than 29 seconds was really too bad. The competition in the rain may be one of the reasons for the decline.

### Tan Rongsheng Leads All the Way in Race Walking Exhibition

In yesterday's track and field events, there was a race walking exhibition with only three participants, Tan Rongsheng, Zhou Ruquan, and Cai Zhengyi, all of whom were experts in this field ten years ago. Cai participated this time representing Hong Kong. The race walking exhibition was originally scheduled for 10,000 meters, but was temporarily changed to 5,000 meters to avoid delaying other track and field programs. Tan Rongsheng took the lead after 1,500 meters and led all the way to the finish line, leaving Cai Zhengyi about 250 meters behind and Zhou Ruquan about 300 meters behind. The result was 26 minutes and 24 seconds. Cai Zhengyi's time was 27 minutes and 25 seconds.

### Football Semi-Finalists Revealed; All as Predicted; Hong Kong Police, Shanghai Army Athletes Vie for Championship; Yesterday's Match in the Rain was Unprecedentedly Grand

[Special Dispatch] The football championship quarter-finals took place yesterday, with all four groups playing at the athletic field and Yi Garden. Spectators flocked to both locations, taking advantage of the weekend holiday. All four venues were packed, an unprecedented sight. The audience was keen to know who would be the final four. The eight teams battled fiercely, creating a tense atmosphere both on and off the field. Skillful footwork and roaring applause echoed each other, creating an exceptionally enthusiastic atmosphere. As predicted, Hong Kong defeated Zhejiang 3-0, the Police defeated Siam China 2-1, Shanghai defeated Dalian 3-1, and the Army defeated Malaysia China 3-1. The Hong Kong, Police, Shanghai, and Army teams will now compete for the championship title in a series of close matches starting tomorrow. Yesterday morning there was a solar eclipse, followed by a sudden downpour in the afternoon. All four matches proceeded during the eclipse and heavy rain until their conclusion. In the Shanghai vs. Dalian match, there was a minor disturbance when a Dalian player assaulted the referee. The organizing committee and the Dalian team were still discussing a resolution late into the evening. The two football preliminary matches that were postponed due to rain the day before were played yesterday afternoon at Zhongzheng Park. Qingdao won against Guizhou 1-0, and Hankou drew with the Philippines 2-2. Due to more rain, extra time was not played, and a replay is scheduled for today at the athletic field.

### Zhejiang Overwhelmed; Hong Kong's "Odd Foot" Scores a Hat-Trick

The Hong Kong vs. Zhejiang match took place at Yi Garden at 9:00 AM, with Li Guoyi as the referee and Deng Xiaoliang and Zhang Zhiren as linesmen. After the kickoff, Hong Kong attacked first, with the five forwards pushing forward rapidly. In the back-and-forth attacks, Hong Kong's center forward, Li Deqi (known as "Odd Foot" in Hong Kong), received the ball at the midline and scored the first goal. Zhejiang tried to counterattack, but with the rain having just stopped, the grass was quite slippery. Although Zhejiang tried hard to advance, their passing was too slow, their coordination lacked vitality, and their footwork seemed weak. Thus, any hesitation allowed the Hong Kong defenders to rush in and intercept, negating the attack. Numerous opportunities were missed afterward. Whenever a Zhejiang player shot, the ball either went slightly wide or over the line, causing the thousands of spectators in the stands to lament in unison. Hong Kong's attack grew increasingly urgent, but fortunately, Zhejiang's defenders and goalkeeper were competent, repeatedly making crucial saves and earning considerable applause. Although Zhejiang was losing, they were able to rally with renewed vigor, largely due to the encouragement of the audience. Unfortunately, just before the end of the first half, Hong Kong's Li Deqi received a pass from Li Chunfa, dribbled quickly, and scored with a sweeping shot, making it 2-0, greatly diminishing Zhejiang's confidence in making a comeback.

After the change of ends, the audience continued to applaud and support Zhejiang, which inspired Xiao Ziwen and Lin Dianyi to make several all-out shots. However, Hong Kong proved to be superior, with Feng Kunsheng and Tan Jun'gan defending meticulously, blocking several shots in a clear and impressive manner. Amid Zhejiang's scoreless predicament, center-back Wu Jiabang committed a foul, allowing Li Deqi to take a penalty kick from 25 yards out, which he converted successfully. Subsequently, Zhejiang's left winger, Wu Binghao, was injured and had to leave the field. After intense battling for some time, the match concluded, with Hong Kong securing a spot in the finals thanks to Li Deqi's three goals.

### Siam China's Fortune is Bumpy; Police Win by a Narrow Margin

The match between the Police and Siam China was not particularly exciting. Siam China's defense was weak, and although their forwards were somewhat satisfactory, they lacked good fortune. They had three shots that hit the goalposts and bounced out; otherwise, the situation might have been different. The Police team had average strength, but their performance was not as good as expected, so the final score was a narrow 2-1 victory, with the muddy field after the rain being a significant factor.

In the first half, the Police team attacked with the wind advantage, and the ball was often in Siam China's territory. After four minutes, Siam China's defender Hu Qinshu intercepted the ball near the sideline and kicked it out, only to have it land right in front of the goal. The Police's center forward, Zhao Fulai, received it perfectly and dribbled straight in. The Siam China players rushed to defend, but in the ensuing chaos, Zhao Fulai kicked the ball straight into the net, making it 1-0. Siam China launched a full-scale counterattack. After twelve minutes, right forward Huang Junqin had an opportunity to shoot diagonally, but the ball hit the crossbar and bounced out. Left inside forward Liang Shunfa was a step too late, missing a golden opportunity to score. Afterward, the ball was often near the Siam China goal, creating several dangerous situations. After twenty-two minutes, Police's Tan Zhenhui committed a foul, and Siam China's Huang Jingqin took the free kick, passing it to Han Jingfeng, whose shot hit the crossbar and bounced out. Liang Shunfa followed up with another shot, which hit the left goalpost. Their bad luck was a source of regret for the spectators. After twenty-six minutes, Police's Xie Jinhe took a free kick and passed it to Zhao Fu. Siam China's marking was lax, and Zhao Fu seized the opportunity to shoot, scoring again, making it 2-0. Afterward, Siam China's forwards made several attempts to score, but all were saved by Police goalkeeper Yu Yaode. The first half ended with Siam China down by two goals. After the break, Siam China gradually improved. After five minutes, right inside forward Zheng Youzhi shot fiercely near the Police goal, but the ball hit the crossbar again and was cleared by the Police inside defender. After eight minutes, Zheng Youzhi received another ball from the back and dribbled straight into the Police penalty area, unleashing a powerful shot from about ten yards out that found the net. After Siam China pulled a goal back, the match became intense, with both sides exchanging attacks and making several attempts to score, but none were successful. Near the end of the match, Police's Liu Tianyou mishit a clearance, and Siam China's Zheng Youzhi sent a long pass to the left front. With the Police team having committed all their players forward, their defense was completely empty. Siam China's left forward Chen Jingxing rushed forward, but just as he was about to shoot near the goal, he too mishit the ball, losing the final opportunity. Shortly afterward, time ran out, and the Police won against Siam China 2-1.

### Dalian Nervous; Shanghai Turns Defeat into Victory with Strength

The match between Shanghai and Dalian was very intense and hard-fought. Although the Dalian team had plenty of strength, they were long on bravery but short on coordination. They were also too nervous, repeatedly arguing with referee Xu Shaowu about free kicks during the match, leading to an unpleasant incident after the match where they assaulted the referee. The Shanghai team had excellent short-passing skills. Center-back Tan Fu was skilled both in attack and defense, and the other defenders were also good, so their victory was more than deserved.

The match began amidst light rain, with Dalian launching fierce attacks, while the Shanghai team defended calmly. After fifteen minutes, Dalian's left forward Jiang Benshen made a deep run on the wing and scored the first goal. The Shanghai team counterattacked, and Dalian's inside defender committed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick. Shanghai's Sun Jinshun took the penalty, but the ball hit the goalpost and bounced out. After a period of back-and-forth action, both sides made several attempts to score, but none were successful. Shortly afterward, Dalian's Wang Zhengwen committed a foul, and the Shanghai team was awarded a free kick, which was passed into the goal area. Xia Tixian rushed forward and deflected the ball in, tying the score at 1-1. A few minutes later, Shanghai's five forwards advanced together, passing the ball to Han Longhai near the goal. Han Longhai shot diagonally, and the Dalian goalkeeper was unable to stop it, making it 2-1 to Shanghai.

The second half was even more intense. Players frequently slipped and fell on the muddy field, but after a long battle, neither side was able to score. Then, near the end of the match, Shanghai's Li Yao took a corner kick, passing the ball several times to Han Longhai, who, from about thirty yards out, unleashed a high shot. The ball slowly descended from the air and landed right into the goal. The Dalian goalkeeper was helpless to stop it, and the match ended with Shanghai winning 3-1.

### Malaysia China Forward Line Strong but Fades; Army Turns the Tide with Composure

The afternoon match between the Army and Malaysia China at Yi Garden attracted a huge crowd. Malaysia China relied on their surprising aggression, launching relentless attacks in the first half, but their momentum waned in the second half, becoming slack and uncoordinated. The Army responded with a composed strategy, ultimately using skillful footwork to break through, leading to Malaysia China's defeat. In the first half, Malaysia China's two defenders put their full effort into defending their area and passing the ball to the forwards, who advanced with great concentration. As a result, left inside forward Liang Kaiming was able to overcome all obstacles and score with ease, with Huang Shijie following up and putting the ball into the net, giving Malaysia China the lead. Shortly afterward, center forward Mei Runhua was injured and replaced by Li Sida. The Army took advantage of the moment when the enemy team was adjusting its lineup to launch a major attack. Left winger Jin Lusheng made several attempts to shoot, but they were all saved by Huang Jintang. However, just before the end of the first half, Fei Chunhua seized an opportunity amidst the chaos and equalized the score with a long shot from the left corner.

At the start of the second half, the two teams continued to battle fiercely. The audience, frustrated by the prolonged stalemate, grew impatient and started to clap and shout, their emotions reaching a boiling point. Inspired by this, the Army fought even harder, with Luo Shoufu and Jin Lusheng scoring within a dozen minutes, securing a 3-1 victory as expected.

### Dalian Players Vent Anger on Referee

Lu Changtai Detained

[Special Dispatch] After the football championship match between Dalian and Shanghai, in which Dalian lost, the Dalian team believed that referee Xu Shaowu was unfair. As soon as the match ended, several players chased after the referee to argue with him. Fortunately, officials from the organizing committee and other referees had noticed the tense situation during the match and, fearing trouble after the match, had already notified a large number of police officers, who were on standby. Upon seeing what happened, they immediately rushed forward, but Xu Shaowu had already been grabbed by the hair and punched. Spectators on the west command platform were outraged by the Dalian players' actions and shouted for them to be beaten, creating a chaotic scene. The police officers worked hard to maintain order, escorting referee Xu Shaowu to the security room and detaining the Dalian substitute player Lu Changtai who had committed the assault. After the incident, all the football referees lodged a strong protest with the organizing committee, demanding that the assaulting player be severely punished and that their safety be guaranteed in the future. Dalian team leader Liu Huakun and Northeast representative Liu Changchun requested that the organizing committee release the detained player. Secretary-General Hao Gengsheng believed that this matter could only be resolved if the referees were willing to reconcile. Liu and others then discussed the matter with the referees, but no agreement had been reached by late evening. The organizing committee decided at its meeting last night to increase security from today onward to maintain safety.

### Off-Field Musings

The fourth type of "beat-up" incident occurred yesterday, which was players beating up a referee. ((1) So-and-so beats up an organizing committee member, (2)(3) organizing committee member beats up organizing committee member, (3) player beats up player, (4) player beats up referee.) What roles are left? Spectators and reporters.

The hero who did the beating yesterday is reportedly still being detained in the police station, unresolved. From any perspective, we advocate for strict punishment, naturally with the aim of curbing further occurrences.

However, if it's a case of killing the chicken to scare the monkey, then it would be despicable, bullying the weak and fearing the strong, something that a wise person would not do.

Buying a ticket but not being able to enter the venue, that's being cheated. The organizing committee shouldn't cheat to get money like that; if there are more instances of profiting from troubled waters, then it would be unspeakable.

Refund tickets and give money back? It's impossible. I'm very worried about those few ticket booths. The Taiwan delegation, an inspiring and lovely group. Unfortunately, it's just such a group... Alas, I don't know how many more "alas" there will be. They come as a team, they leave as a team, with the team flag in front. They sing loudly on the way there and back, receiving applause and cheers along the way. I think that this is the only glory of this Games. I don't value those national records that are broken, or even world records that are broken. If every unit can maintain such discipline, even if it's 18 seconds for 100 meters or a 5-meter long jump, it won't be ugly. (O.K.)

### Men's Basketball Re-matches: Shanghai Decisively Defeats the Navy; Combined Logistics, Filipino-Chinese, and Police of Shanghai Secure Finals Qualification

[Report from our newspaper] The men's basketball tournament reached the re-match stage for finals qualification on the 9th. Combined Logistics valiantly defeated Tianjin, the Filipino team decisively defeated the Air Force, the Police smartly defeated Shenyang, and Shanghai decisively defeated the Navy. Combined Logistics, the Filipino team, the Police, and Shanghai all secured finals qualification. Among these four matches, the Combined Logistics versus Tianjin game was the most intense. The battle situation is recorded in detail below:

Combined Logistics Defeats Tianjin

Held at 3:00 PM. After the start of the game, Li Hanting of Tianjin committed a foul, and Zheng Daguang of Combined Logistics missed the free throw. Combined Logistics repeatedly approached Tianjin's defense, but failed to break through. Wang Shixuan committed a foul, and Tianjin scored one point from the free throw. Tianjin committed a foul, and Jia Zhijun of Combined Logistics also scored from the free throw, tying the score at 1-1. Li Hanting committed another foul, and Zhijun scored again from the free throw, making it 2-1. Tianjin's forward made a long-range shot, scoring, and Zhang Changlu added two more points, making it 5-2. Li Hanting of Tianjin committed another foul, and Combined Logistics got two free throw opportunities, both of which were successful, tying the score at 5-5. Jia Zhijun passed to Liao Dihang, Liao passed long to Cao Zhiji, Cao passed back to Jia, who jumped up and dunked the ball in. Zhijun scored again, making it 9-5, Combined Logistics taking the lead. Tianjin made one out of one free throw, making it 8-9; Liao Dihang scored from the free throw, making it 10-8. At this time, the two teams competed within one or two points of each other. Combined Logistics scored three consecutive times, and Tianjin couldn't catch up. In the first half, the score was 21-16, with Combined Logistics in the lead.

The situation remained tense in the second half. Zheng Daguang was replaced by Bu Yanshi, and Cao Zhiji was replaced by Zhang Chuanzhi. The playing styles of these two players were different from Wang, Jia, and Liao, so the team lost two points in a row, causing the audience to shout in disapproval. Later, Bu was replaced by Zheng Daguang again, and Zhang was replaced by Cao Zhiji again, stabilizing the situation slightly. Zhang Changlu of Tianjin fought hard to break through and scored a goal. Time was up, and the score was 37-30. Combined Logistics defeated Tianjin. The foul scores of both teams are as follows:

Combined Logistics Team Fouls Points

Filipino-Chinese Defeats Air Force

Held at 4:00 PM. At the start of the game, the Air Force committed a foul, and Chen Jinde scored one point from the free throw. Pan Zuoliang of the Air Force missed the free throw, and Yu Jin of the Philippine team scored a goal, scored from another free throw, and Chen Jin added the finishing touch. Jinde scored again from the free throw, making it 7-0, a remarkable momentum. Later, the scores were 14-3, 19-9, 21-11, 21-12. The Air Force repeatedly tried to counterattack but failed.

Shanghai Takes Navy

Held at 1:00 PM. After the jump ball, Wu Chengzhang of Shanghai had the ball intercepted, and Cai Lianke committed a foul. After Yu Ruizhang of the Navy scored from a free throw, he scored two more points. Unfortunately, the Navy's good times didn't last long.

Zhenzhong committed a foul, and He Lide of the Navy scored from a free throw, making it 4-3. Cai Wenhua of Shanghai made a one-handed diagonal shot, and Chengzhang added two more points, making it 7-3. Yu Ruizhang of the Navy scored again, making it 7-5, still trying to catch up.

### Small Notes by the Basketball Court

[Report from our newspaper] The performance of Combined Logistics on the 8th was not spectacular. Many shots missed the basket. Liao Dihang's saying that "the flower blooms as soon as the ball is tossed" did not come to fruition.

In the Filipino team's match on the 8th, every shot went in, reversing the inaccurate shooting in the match on the 7th. Some people said that the Filipino team had studied the gymnasium's basketball hoops in depth. In the Filipino team's match against the Air Force, Air Force Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou made a special trip to watch the game. At halftime, he ordered Hu Weike, the principal of the Air Force Military Academy, to give instructions to the team members.

When the Shanghai team played, female athletes from Shanghai came to cheer them on, making the game particularly exciting. (Yu)

### Female Athletes Fight Bravely in the Rain; Four Basketball Matches Conclude; Shanghai-Indonesia-Philippines-Fujian Round Robin Tournament to be Held Today

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, a total of four women's basketball re-matches were held at 2:00 PM at the Second and Sixth Courts. As a result, Indonesia narrowly defeated Guangzhou by one point; Shanghai decisively defeated Hebei; the Hubei vs. Philippines match, and the Fujian vs. Nanjing match, were played in heavy rain. The players fought bravely in the rain, and the referees officiated in the rain, a commendable spirit.

Indonesia Barely Wins Against Guangzhou

Based on previous performances, Indonesia should have easily defeated Guangzhou.

Shanghai Defeats Hebei

In the Shanghai vs. Hebei match, Huang Mingyuan scored the first basket. Wang Weizhen committed a foul, and Hebei missed the free throw. Shanghai took the lead with a score of 2-0. At this moment, Mingyuan caught the ball near the basket, broke through, and Ma Guisheng tripped her, causing her to lose consciousness on the spot. After first aid, she re-entered the court after five minutes. Shi Zonglan and Yin Yunying displayed their shooting skills. In the first quarter, the score was 6-4, with Shanghai in the lead. Afterwards, Hebei gradually weakened. Shi Zonglan, Huang Minghuan, and Wang Huiling scored consecutively. Hebei relied solely on Yin Yunying's individual efforts. In the end, Shanghai defeated Hebei with a score of 34-18.

Philippines Defeats Hubei

In the Philippines vs. Hubei match, heavy rain began shortly after the start of the game. Hubei's defense couldn't defend against the Philippine team's forward's fierce attacks. Yang Xiuzhi and Huang Rulan were very active under Hubei's basket. In the first quarter, the score was 15-8, and in the first half, the score was 23-10, both with the Philippine team in the lead. He Manli of Hubei had excellent individual skills. It's rare to find such talent in the mainland, but unfortunately, the guards were too weak, resulting in a situation where the gains didn't outweigh the losses. In the end, Hubei lost with a score of 45-30.

Fujian Valiantly Defeats Nanjing

The Nanjing vs. Fujian match was the most intense and fierce moment yesterday. Wang Qiman and Hu Weiling of Nanjing, although short in stature, had extremely pure basic movements, but their shooting accuracy was not as accurate as their previous performances. In the first half, Nanjing still had an advantage with a score of 9-8. Afterwards, the scores were tied at 13 each. The weather suddenly changed, and the two teams fought in the rain. Nanjing's guards had strong defensive power, and Fujian couldn't break through. Xu Xinxi recklessly attempted long-range shots, most of which were off target. Ju Cai's two shots determined the overall situation. Fujian finally won with a score of 27-19.

### Solar Eclipse Causes Rain; Audience Crowds the Venue

[Report from our newspaper] Starting at 10:30 AM yesterday, the sky gradually became dark. Some audience members who couldn't enter the venue planned to go home. At 11:00 AM, there was light rain. Half an hour later, it suddenly cleared up (the venue's office had informed the audience based on the observatory's report that this was due to a solar eclipse). At 5:10 PM, it rained again and didn't stop. The indoor temperature was 68 degrees, but the audience crowded the venue and didn't disperse.

### Hongqiao Airport Packed; 200,000 Eyes Fully Mobilized; Competing to Watch the Parachute Jumping Performance; The Games Can't Control the Sky; Enjoy the Show Even Without Buying a Ticket

[Report from our newspaper] The paratrooper parachute jumping performance, which was not held on the opening day of the National Games due to bad weather, was held at Hongqiao Airport yesterday noon. The citizens were very interested in the novelty of the program. After 10:00 AM, the audience continuously gathered towards Hongqiao Airport. Cars, bicycles, group charters, and pedestrians created an unprecedented spectacle on Hongqiao Road.

The audience around the airport exceeded 100,000 people, and the total number of cars was over 3,000. The airport's order was maintained by the ground crew of the Civil Aviation Transportation Corps, strictly restricting the audience from approaching the airport runway. Outside the venue, traffic was directed in sections by the police force, cadre training corps, military police, and other units. The audience arriving after 1:30 PM was blocked outside the airport and couldn't enter. Parachute jumping from high altitudes could be seen from near and far. The crowd blocked outside the venue occupied the pillboxes built by the Japanese army in the past as temporary stands. The Games couldn't control the sky, so it was a free show, and no tickets were sold. Therefore, the audience was particularly crowded.

The paratroopers performing the parachute jumping, including combat and ground personnel, totaled 70 people, led by Xu Yanwu, the Major General Deputy Commander of the Paratrooper Command, and Yang Chunbai, the Deputy Director, and Jiang Jian, the Deputy Regiment Commander. Two C-46 transport planes, "Xiamen No." and "Liuzhou No.", were borrowed from the Civil Aviation Transportation Corps. "Xiamen No." took off at 12:30 PM. Major Instructor Luo Xueliang first made a test jump, followed by two-person and four-person groups performing pinpoint landings.

Colorful Umbrellas Flutter; Cheers from the Crowd

"Xiamen No." flew diagonally at low altitude. Paratroopers jumped out of the plane's door, and white parachutes opened in the wind, fluttering in space. The entire audience responded with enthusiastic applause. Only three groups performed pinpoint landings, and the performance ended quickly. After "Xiamen No." landed, all the paratroopers reassembled, carried firearms, and boarded the plane again. "Xiamen" and "Liuzhou" took off simultaneously and flew around the field twice. The ground troops released red signal smoke in the center of the airport. When the plane passed over the red smoke, the paratroopers jumped from the plane one after another from 2,000 feet in a mass descent. For a moment, red, white, and green colorful parachutes dotted the blue sky, like a scattering of heavenly flowers. The entire audience cheered as if thunderstruck.

Descending 2,000 Feet in Two Minutes

The mass descent was held in two groups, with 18 paratroopers in each group, equipped with three parachutes each. Each descent had a total of 21 parachutes. Because the weather was suitable yesterday, the 2,000-foot descent only took two minutes. However, the terrain was uneven, and there were many large puddles due to the rain. Many paratroopers landed in the puddles, getting their clothes wet. It was heard that the original plan was to follow the mass descent with a combat performance and live ammunition shooting, but because there were too many spectators around, fearing accidents, it was temporarily cancelled. Therefore, the entire program ended at one moment. At that time, many spectators mistakenly thought that it would be held at 3:00 PM and were rushing by car to arrive, meeting the cars exiting the airport on the way. One in and one out, Hongqiao Road was completely blocked. All the cars had to line up and drive slowly. It took three hours to go from the airport to Daxilu, which shows the extent of the congestion.

### Rain Sprinkles on Qi Peilin; Right Leg Was Injured; Changing Direction; Mind is Mechanized and Precise

[Special Report from our Newspaper] After Qi Peilin, a Tianjin team athlete, stepped down from the podium, the reporter stepped forward and shook his hand warmly, congratulating him on breaking the national record in the discus throw with a score of 41.55 meters. At this time, he was truly proud. Guo Jianzhang (Jie), the holder of the previous record, had been defeated and placed fourth.

He said modestly: This achievement was really accidental. He said that when he was practicing in Dajin, he only threw 40 meters, and he only threw 38 meters in the preliminary round. Before coming to Shanghai, he had been practicing for about a month, and his score had never exceeded 40 meters. But he also told the reporter that he had once created a record of 42 meters when he was a student.

He is from Gaoyang, Hebei. This year he is 31 years old and already the father of two children. Before the war, he studied at Hebei Institute of Technology. After the war, he finished his studies at the Normal University. After graduating, he is now a professor of mechanical drawing at Tianjin Institute of Technology. From his appearance, although you can't see a very burly physique, you would never think that he is a person with a precise mind close to a machine.

In the past, he said that he liked high jumping very much and often played basketball. His high jump had won the championship of the first Hebei National Games with a score of 1.65 meters, but playing basketball injured his right leg, which made him interested in shot put and discus. He said: "I am a person who loves sports very much, so switching from high jump and basketball to shot put and discus was completely passive." At this time, the reporter laughed and said to him; "Now that your discus has broken the national record, do you want to actively continue your efforts in preparation for winning some glory for the team at the World Games?" He repeatedly said, "I dare not, I dare not!" Although it was still his modesty, I believe that countless people expect him to do the same as the reporter.

From his conversation, the reporter learned that he also has a happy family. His wife is from the same hometown and graduated from Hebei Normal School. The reporter wanted to know if his love of sports also had his wife's encouragement, so I asked: "Does your wife also like sports?" He answered vaguely: "Not very much!"

While they were talking, a reporter from another newspaper came to ask him to sign his name. He writes a good fountain pen script, but I saw that there was no "rain" radical on top of his character "Lin" [in Qi Peilin's name], so I asked him what the character actually was. He said that it was added by someone else when he was registering. It was drizzling in the sky at this time, and everyone laughed and said that he would really get rained on! (Yu)

### Who Does the Men's Basketball Championship Belong To? If the Shanghai Team Can Strengthen Cooperation, the Championship May Not Be Lost

— By Our Reporter, Chu Yusheng

The men's basketball finals start today. The finals adopt a single round-robin system. Each win is worth two points. The team with the most points sits on the throne of the champion, the second most points gets the silver, the next gets the bronze, and the team with all losses gets fourth place. Therefore, which team will be the champion, runner-up, third place, and fourth place? This should be the most concerning thing for fans and readers.

The key to winning or losing in basketball lies in the fact that the average skills of the entire team are above standard, the spirit of cooperation and unity is fully utilized, the team can endure and be patient for a long time, has abundant energy, and has accurate shooting. The four teams that have recently won the right to compete in the finals, such as Shanghai, the Filipino team, Combined Logistics, and the Police, all possess the above conditions, so it is really impossible to make a judgment at this time. However, we have observed their battles for several days, and there are many things that can be used as a reference.

First, let's talk about the Shanghai team. The individual skills of each member of the Shanghai team are almost perfect. No one can match their shooting accuracy. The team can also use strategies, calmly respond to battles, and supplement them with their familiar and brand-new tactics, so they naturally have the ambition to win the championship. However, they sometimes neglect the spirit of unity and cooperation. The battle between Shanghai and Saigon was simply a performance of individual skills. In the Shanghai vs. Navy game, the spirit of cooperation could not be brought into full play. Therefore, in the Shanghai vs. Combined Logistics game and the Shanghai vs. Filipino team game, if the spirit of cooperation is not good, the future is not optimistic.

As for the Combined Logistics team, the team is full of energy and is the most durable of the four teams. The playing style is of the northern style, and the spirit of cooperation is still good. However, in the game against Tianjin, the shooting was too inaccurate. Also, Shixuan and Zhiji often go deep into the enemy's formation. If they encounter Shanghai's tactic of luring the enemy deep and then cutting in to score points, Combined Logistics will suffer a big loss. Combined Logistics is sometimes too nervous, but their rapid playing style can be said to be unmatched. In the game against Shanghai, if Combined Logistics can stabilize the rear and cooperate with the frontline attacks, they may be able to achieve some success. Otherwise, once there is a leak, defeat is easy to bear. In the game against the Filipino team, Combined Logistics should still adopt a rapid attack, but they cannot be too flustered. In the game against the Police, they must not be too careless.

The Filipino team is good at using new tactics and strategies, and their spirit of cooperation is also good. The only shortcoming of the team is the lack of a center forward. Therefore, their contest with Shanghai may not be as smooth as they hoped. In the game against Combined Logistics, they must be wary of their strong cuts and long-range attacks. They cannot underestimate the Police in the game against them.

The Police team is really a rising star among the four teams. The skills are average, and the shooting is also accurate. However, because they are relatively young, they are often too nervous when they lose many points. Therefore, they must be careful when dealing with Shanghai, Combined Logistics, and the Filipino team.

In the battle for hegemony, the venue is very important. For example, those who are used to playing outdoors are not used to playing indoors, and those who are used to playing indoors are not used to playing outdoors. Now all four teams are competing indoors. The so-called "floor skills" of those playing indoors is considered to be the best by Shanghai, followed by the Filipino team and the Police, and then Combined Logistics. Therefore, this can also be used to see some key points.

The reporter believes that if the Shanghai team strengthens its spirit of cooperation, it may be able to win the championship. If the shooting accuracy of the Combined Logistics team is still the same as on the 9th, they may lose to Shanghai in the first game. Then Combined Logistics and the Filipino team will compete for the runner-up. However, things are unpredictable. If the Police are particularly attentive and work hard, they may also have the hope of winning the runner-up. If Combined Logistics can fully utilize new strategies and tactics, they may be able to win the championship. If the Filipino team can improve their weakness in the center, they can also enter the first place.

### Temporary Stands

[Report from our Newspaper] All spectators entered the venue by queuing with tickets, and the length of the line was no exaggeration. It could encircle the entire venue at least once, breaking all previous queuing records.

To prevent the collapse of the fence from causing accidents, the organizing committee has supported it with thick wooden pillars, temporarily hired a large number of workers to nail horizontal bars onto the wooden frames. Many people climbed down from the stands and sat leisurely on the horizontal bars, almost making them their temporary stands.

Yesterday, the basketball game in the stadium was more crowded than ever. Both doors were broken through. The Boy Scouts could not resist and temporarily moved two small cannons to block the doors. Spectators entered and exited through the broken holes. (Excerpts)

### All-China Games Briefs

Regarding the return travel arrangements for the All-China Games delegations from various regions, the organizing committee has reached an agreement with the Ministry of Transportation. When using the national railways, a 50% discount will be offered. When taking ships from the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, an 80% discount will be offered. The reception team believes that train tickets and seats on ships and airplanes are currently very crowded. It is necessary to make proper plans as soon as possible. Therefore, all units are notified to inform the reception team immediately of the number of team members, departure date, planned mode of transportation, and the name and address of the person in charge, in order to facilitate arrangements. The Municipal Police Department's Juvenile Police Team has been temporarily suspending its city hygiene inspection work recently to assist in maintaining order within the All-China Games venue. Unexpectedly, the accurate shooting of the Indonesian forwards was greatly diminished yesterday, especially Li Xiuli, who was particularly abnormal and missed many shots. The first quarter ended with a 5-5 tie. Lin Gui won, and Indonesia led 9-6 in the first half. In the second half, the Guangzhou team replaced Rao Huijuan with Huang Youping, greatly strengthening the forward line. They managed to tie the score at 10-10 and 13-13 twice. The third quarter ended with Guangzhou leading 15-14. Li Xiuli scored, and Indonesia led by two points again. With little time remaining, Huang Youping made three consecutive free throws. The buzzer sounded, and Indonesia defeated Guangzhou by one point.

### Women's Volleyball Round Robin Begins; Shanghai and Hunan Win, Taiwan and Guangzhou Each Score Two Points; Men's Volleyball Round Robin Starts Today, Guangzhou and Hong Kong Will Have a Fierce Battle

[Report from our Newspaper] The men's volleyball round robin starts today. The highly praised Guangzhou team will face its strong opponent, the Hong Kong team, this morning. A fierce battle is expected. Furthermore, the results of yesterday's men's volleyball qualifying matches are as follows: Xinjiang defeated Henan in three straight sets, with scores of 21-17, 21-14, and 21-18. Jilin defeated the Navy, also three to zero, with scores of 21-8, 21-8, and 21-10. Hunan won because the Army forfeited.

[Report from our Newspaper] The four women's volleyball teams from Shanghai, Taiwan, Hunan, and Guangzhou began their round robin yesterday. Shanghai and Hunan both won in two straight sets, each scoring two points. The Shanghai-Taiwan match was very exciting. The situation is as follows:

Shanghai Players Defeat Taiwan

The Shanghai team, with its strong players Chen Meizhen and Huang Mingyuan, was beyond what the Taiwan team could resist. Chen Meizhen is tall and her spikes are fierce, allowing her to be in a commanding position, making it impossible for the opponent to block the net. However, all members of the team are competent in defense and have good coordination. The overall team development should not be beaten passively. Unfortunately, the Taiwan team members took the wins and losses too seriously, and were unable to respond calmly. Occasional errors led to mutual accusations, resulting in panic after each defeat and repeated mistakes. They lost both games to the Shanghai team.

At the beginning of the first game, the Shanghai team scored with a serve, and the team immediately responded. The two sides fought fiercely to a tie, and Shanghai's overwhelming advantage was not yet visible. However, after a 14-14 tie, the Taiwan team felt the pressure from Chen Meizhen, the military was panicked, and made many mistakes, resulting in no progress after 14 points and losing the first game. At the beginning of the second game, Taiwan lost confidence, and the front and middle rows of the Shanghai team took the opportunity to make major kills, and relied on the brilliant result of 21-10 to overwhelm Taiwan. The lineups of the two teams are attached below:

Shanghai

Zhu Jinyun Chen Meizhen Wang Shan
Chen Liuzhen Wang Weizhen Huang Mingyuan
Xiang Yulin Chen Jieshu Jiang Zhaoshan

Taiwan

Luo Ni Sun Jinxi Yan Xiuying
Yang Yu'er Jiang Guizhi Chen Meiyu
Gao Jingya Zhang Yuese Chen Huaguang

Hunan Daughters' Army Overwhelms Guangzhou

The Hunan Daughters' Army, which previously defeated the Zhejiang team, crushed the Guangzhou team yesterday with an absolute overwhelming advantage.

Chen Peikun of the Hunan team spiked wonderfully, comparable to Chen Meizhen of Shanghai.

The physical strength and combat skills of the Guangzhou team members are poor. The previous match against Henan was already extremely difficult to win. This time, when they met the Hunan Iron Army, they naturally could not resist. Therefore, at the beginning of the first game, when the Hunan team scored 13 consecutive points, Guangzhou was still blank. In the end, the Hunan team easily won the first game with a disparity of 21-3. In the second game, although the Guangzhou team tried its best to counterattack, it was fortunately tied at 19-19, but still gave up defense.

The lineups of the two teams are attached below:

Hunan

### Three Softball Games Yesterday; Shanghai, Guangdong, Police, and Taiwan Teams Will Hold a Round Robin Today to Compete for the Championship

[Report from our Newspaper] In yesterday's three softball championship games, Guangdong defeated the Air Force, the Police narrowly defeated Fujian, and Taiwan defeated the United Logistics. They and Shanghai are the final four teams, and the round robin will be held at Yiyuan starting today.

### Three Boxing Matches; Yang Jinlai Agile as a Dragon; Knocked Down Li Dongfen in the Second Round; Two Shanghai Generals Defeat Taiwan and Hubei

[Report from our Newspaper] Last night's boxing at the Municipal Stadium originally had two middleweight semi-finals. However, Guangdong's Xu Dawei was injured in the foot and announced his retirement. Therefore, only the battle between Li Dongfen (Hong Kong) and Yang Jinlai (Guangdong) remained. Also, because Guangdong believed that Li Dongfen's reported weight was incorrect, they insisted on weighing on the spot, which led to a stalemate. The moderator tried his best to mediate before reluctantly resolving the situation. The game started at 8:45 PM. Li Dongfen was more burly, but not as agile as Yang Jinlai, so he was at a disadvantage. In the second round, he was knocked down four times. Although he persisted to the end, he was judged to have lost due to insufficient points compared to Yang Jinlai. Yang will compete with Shanghai's Li Kai the night after tomorrow (12th) for the middleweight championship.

In the other two light-welterweight matches, Shanghai's Fei Miaolong defeated Taiwan's Hong Caitian by one point, and Shanghai's Huang Zengxiu defeated Hubei's Chen Keqiang (points 26 to 20). The battle between Shanghai's Fei and Huang to win the light-welterweight championship will be held the night after tomorrow.

### Venue Order Once Disrupted

Spectators Break Through Erdao Defense Line

Military Police and Boy Scouts Sweat Profusely

Yesterday was Sunday, and the weather after the solar eclipse was partly cloudy and partly sunny. More people came to visit the sports meet than on the first day, and we really saw a "sea of people" at this time.

At 11:00 AM, the entire venue was full. Spectators gathered outside the venue. Although the military police prevented them from entering, at 11:40 AM, the defense lines at the two entrances were broken, and the crowd poured into the venue. Then the military police and Boy Scouts built a second defense line to prevent spectators from entering the track, but it was soon broken again, and the order was greatly disrupted.

Near the entrances and exits on each stand, the crowd was surging, pushing and squeezing each other, in a chaotic mess. Later, the crowd rushed down the railing, crossed the bamboo fence, and even rushed into the track and field. The competition was therefore declared to be suspended twice. The military police, flying fortresses, and Boy Scouts were exhausted and sweating profusely.

The loudspeaker said at one moment: "If the audience does not leave the venue, the competition will be stopped immediately." At another moment, it desperately said hello. Such a combination of soft and hard tactics gradually made the audience leave the venue, which had a small effect.

Thinking of the order of the 6th National Games, when Chen was booed off the field, it really makes people sigh that the Chinese people have regressed even on this point.

The weather was not good, and it started to rain again around 5:00 PM, sometimes heavy and sometimes light. White newspapers were used as rain hats. Speculators outside the venue were selling small paper umbrellas, and each one was priced at 130,000 yuan.

Shen Xiqing, the leader of the Henan wrestling team, gave a speech to the surrounding audience angrily because the conference did not allow them to participate in wrestling: "We have already received the announcement cloth, but our names are not on the list. What are we doing from the opening to rush over?" Finally, he asked the conference to allow Henan players to have a performance match with the champions of each group at least once. Two people fainted in the venue today: an old man's abdomen was pressed against the railing and almost died. (Education)

### Tennis Singles and Doubles Have Disparate Strengths; Liao Yifang Resists Tao Champion; Gan Zaichuan Is Good at Old Man's Ball; Men's and Women's Singles Semi-Finals Continue Today

[Report from our Newspaper] Only one men's doubles tennis match was played yesterday, with police officers Tao Guanqiu and Wang Wenzheng against Zhejiang's Zhong Shibao and Sun Chuanxin. Tao and Wang won very easily. The remaining games were changed to the second round of men's singles and the first round of women's singles.

The women's singles competition was mediocre. Shanghai's Zhang Zhiying, Malaysia's Chen Junyu, Lu Yuanchun, Indonesia's Chen Jinshi, Zhang Meishan, and Guangzhou's Luo Qiaoer all advanced. Chen Jinshi is the strongest of all the players. Today's semi-finals will continue to compete for the finals.

A total of ten men's singles matches were played yesterday, one of which was a qualifying match, in which Guizhou's Wen Ling easily defeated Jiangxi's Yin Shoumin.

In the championship, Shanghai's Chen Yi won against Li Wenxuan (Indonesia) in the morning, but lost to Malaysia's Ruan Guolin in the afternoon. However, Mr. Ruan will meet Tao Guanqiu (police) today, and it may be difficult to win. Yesterday's battle between Tao Guanqiu and Liao Yifang (Guangzhou) was the most exciting. Mr. Liao's backhand draw was very powerful, resisting Tao Guanqiu and winning a lot of applause. Indonesia's Chen Lichao won against Xu Runpei (Hong Kong) yesterday, and will face Ye Guanxiong (Guangzhou) today; Judging from yesterday's competition, it may not be easy for Mr. Ye to win. However, there must be many exciting things in the game between the two sides. Wang Wenzheng (police) did not seem to have any trouble winning against Mei Jiesheng (Tan). Gan Zaichuan (Taiwan)'s old man's ball caused Zhou Guanjun (Shanghai) a lot of trouble, and he kept complaining. The advanced men will continue the semi-finals today.

The results of each game yesterday are listed below:

### A Wave of Prices Rising in a Straight Line; The Periodic Price Increase Storm Begins Again

The general price level this year once set off a wave of price increases in the second week of March after the Lunar New Year, and then turned silent. Until the end of April, it hovered and advanced in this stable state. However, in recent months, the money supply has been relaxed, the unofficial interest rate has fallen below the ground, and the market is full of dangers. The new wave of price increases was about to break out, but due to the gradual realization of US loans and the imminent issuance of short-term treasury bills, there were many concerns, resulting in a state of wanting to rise but stopping. Until last week, treasury bills have been launched, but the effect is not ideal. Although US aid has developed to a considerable stage, the arrival of materials is still pending. Therefore, under this already mature environment, the general price level broke the silent state of recent months and showed a trend of rising in a straight line. From the beginning of the week to the weekend, the waves were turbulent, and the firmness was unusually high, indicating that a new periodic price increase storm has begun. Judging from the wholesale price index compiled by this journal last week, it increased by 9.21%. (Due to the time relationship, the index compiled by this journal only includes data up to Thursday, and the price fluctuations on Friday and Saturday cannot be fully expressed.) The new wave of price increases last week was led by financial commodities, followed by the goods market, mutually supporting each other, and the market price gradually increased. The money supply is still very loose. Except for a slight tightening on the weekend, the National Bank's exchange has not much difference, and on Wednesday, it made a difference of more than 150 billion. The unofficial interest rate hovered between 24% and 27%. There are many factors that caused this price increase storm. The more important ones are briefly analyzed as follows:

First, since Mr. Bei Zuyi returned to China from the United States, rumors of opening up foreign exchange have been rampant. Because the current foreign exchange policy cannot stimulate exports and has no power to supply imports, it is really necessary to change course. Now that US loans have been successful, the general opinion is that the time for reform has come. Once foreign exchange is opened, the government will no longer supply the foreign exchange quotas required by the industrial and commercial sectors in the future, even the small amount at present, and they must find ways in the market themselves. Therefore, the US dollar will be in a state of more demand than supply. The news is good, and the trend of rising prices is closely related to this. Gold, stocks, and even other prices, which are closely related to this, have also followed the rise. Until Thursday, the authorities solemnly denied opening up foreign exchange, but the prairie fire has become a reality and cannot be stopped immediately.

Second, the People's Food Allocation Committee announced an increase in the price of household rice in May. According to the allocation of household rice in April, the amount was 15.6 jin, and the price was 110,000 yuan. In May, the allocation was reduced to 15 jin, and the price was increased to 350,000 yuan. The market price of rice has been flat for a long time, and it took the opportunity to rise. In addition, frequent reports of rising rice prices in the producing areas are also the main reason for stimulating the rise in rice prices in Shanghai. For example, Wuxi white rice increased from 4.15 million at the end of the previous week to 5.256 million on Friday. The Wuhu rice market increased by 600,000 to 700,000 per stone from Tuesday to Thursday. The special machine reached 3.6 million on Thursday, the rough rice was 4.3 million, and the clean rice was 3.9 million.

Third, idle funds have no proper outlet. In recent months, due to the suspension of deferred settlement of securities trading, the National Treasury's payment of various matured price coupons, the large amount of expenditure, and the continuous flow of funds from Northeast China to the south, Shanghai has been flooded with abnormal amounts of idle funds. Judging from the National Bank's exchange situation, there have been repeated differences, and the unofficial interest rate has always hovered at a low level, which can be seen. According to estimates, the recent amount of idle funds in Shanghai should be more than 10 trillion. Short-term treasury bills, an important tool specially designed by the National Bank to absorb funds, have already been launched. However, the shortest period of treasury bills is one month. Calculated based on the issue date of 87.3% discount plus a monthly interest rate of 5%, the total monthly interest rate is no more than 20%. Although it was raised to 84.5% on Tuesday, the total interest is only 24% per month, which has little control over the market funds, but makes speculators feel a sense of fear that had previously existed. Therefore, a large amount of idle funds rushed to the financial and commodity markets, causing a price increase storm.

Fourth, in recent months, factories have been moving south, and funds have been flowing south at an increasing rate. Recently, there is no suitable industry or commerce in Guangzhou, South China, to invest in. The only place to escape is Hong Kong, forming an abnormal development of urgent demand for Hong Kong dollars. Therefore, the Hong Kong exchange rate has repeatedly shrunk sharply. It is estimated that the exchange rate of 1 million legal currencies was 6.7 yuan per Hong Kong dollar at the end of the previous week, shrinking to 4.8 yuan per Hong Kong dollar on Friday of last week. Since the Hong Kong exchange rate has shrunk so sharply, gold, banknotes, and general financial commodities in Shanghai have also risen sharply like shadows. Regarding the economic problems between China and Hong Kong, unreasonable phenomena have emerged one after another. The current situation has entered such a serious stage. The authorities should no longer follow the old ways and need to seek appropriate countermeasures as soon as possible.

Fifth, prices in Shanghai have been stable for a considerable period of time. The money supply has always been loose, and the National Bank has been unable to tighten it. In addition, the cost of living index for employees and public education personnel published by the competent authorities in April has increased. At the same time, the National Congress closed, and most of the representatives took the opportunity to come to Shanghai. The National Games also opened at this time, and athletes from all over the country gathered in Shanghai, and consumption increased. Various direct and indirect reasons are complex and countless, resulting in this inevitable major price increase storm.

The new measures related to prices last week that can be described are: First, the foreign exchange rate has not been adjusted for a long time, and the difference between the black market exchange rate is too great. The license can be exchanged at the current exchange rate, but after the imported goods arrive, the price in North Africa is calculated according to the exchange rate cost. In order to eliminate this unreasonable phenomenon, it is stipulated that when importers receive the notice of the import license, they will first pay 50% of the guarantee deposit in domestic currency according to the exchange rate at that time. When the goods arrive, they will be exchanged at the then price. This measure, in terms of the current foreign exchange policy that has fallen into the bureau, is still a way to treat the head when the head is itchy.

Second, regarding the development of US aid issues, the Executive Yuan approved the establishment of the US Aid Utilization Committee at the Yuan meeting on Tuesday. The Executive Yuan President will preside over the committee, which will have 13 members, and the director of the committee will appoint three members as standing committee members to assist in the special meeting affairs. There will also be one secretary-general and one deputy secretary-general, responsible for handling the vehicle affairs. It is heard that the distribution of various US aid materials in the future will still be handled through the allocation method.

Third, last week, the heads of the Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Wuhan financial management bureaus went to Beijing together and suggested to the financial authorities to abolish domestic exchange restrictions and relax controls. Whether they can be implemented remains to be seen.

Under the stimulation of the various bullish factors mentioned above last week, the market situation was strong and many unprecedented high prices were created.

In the Chinese stock market, the stock king Yongsha once broke the 3,000 yuan mark. Jingfu, Xinyi, Business, and other varieties have also repeatedly reached the limit. The trend of foreign stocks is more than that of Chinese stocks.

In terms of cloth, the prices outside the circle are high, and there are rumors in the market that the inventory of textiles is not much. The rising trend is in a straight line. For example, 42 branches of Jianfeng closed at 242 million at the end of the previous week, and broke the 300 million mark at the end of last week. The 21 branches of Double Horse also increased from 170 million at the end of the previous week to 210 million on Friday of last week. The head fine cloth also rose in price, reaching a peak of 6.32 million on Friday.

Due to the price increase of the People's Food Allocation Committee and the price increase in production areas, the price of white rice in the north and south markets has generally increased by about 800,000 to 900,000 in the past week. Coarse grains and edible oil have also risen. Flour is selling well in the north. For example, the price of Bingshan No. 1 flour increased from 1.42 million at the end of the previous week to 1.8 million at the weekend. Edible grains are selling better due to seasonal reasons, and the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar is constantly being adjusted. It is estimated that 1.5 yuan of Taiwan dollars is equivalent to 278 yuan of legal currency, 288 yuan on the 6th, and 302 yuan on the 7th. For example, the price of sugar at the weekend has exceeded the 1,000 yuan mark. Other daily necessities, chemicals, building materials, etc., have all risen, creating a huge wave.

### Currency and Finance

(1) Money Supply and Hot Money

Last week, the money supply in this city continued its previous trend, showing an extremely loose situation. The price surge in May was very intense, with financial items experiencing even more frantic increases. Although demand from all parties was very keen, due to the accumulation of hot money and abundant supply sources, there was no sign of tightening in the loose money situation for the time being. Market interest rates were between 24 and 25.5 cents on Monday of last week. Although they briefly rose to 27 cents and even 28.5 cents on Wednesday and Thursday, they fell back to 24 cents on Friday, indicating the generally ample funds. According to reports, a financial industry insider stated that the reserve of hot money in this city is very substantial, unofficially estimated to be as high as ten trillion yuan. It is said that the reason why hot money is so rampant is due to the influence of the following factors:

(1) Agricultural loans from various places have flowed into the cities, resulting in an unusually abundant supply of cash chips in this city. (2) Government and bank expenditures are enormous. (3) Few people are purchasing short-term treasury bills, and the authorities have no effective methods to tighten the money supply. (4) The principal and interest on the 27th, 29th, and 31st year U.S. dollar bonds are due. (5) The arrival of National Assembly representatives and athletes from various places in Shanghai inevitably increases some extra purchasing power. (6) According to reports, the frantic rise in the black market for gold and banknotes is due to purchases by certain prominent figures.

The inability of underground interest rates to rise is sufficient to indicate that the loose money supply will have to be maintained for some time. The enormous expenditures of the national treasury can also be seen in the exchange differences of national banks. From Monday to Friday, national banks showed a surplus of 842.8 billion yuan due to income from sugar and yarn, but this number also includes large fixed deposits of commercial banks in national banks. Therefore, after deducting this, national banks had a real deficit almost every day, with a net deficit of 1,072 billion yuan in five days, which significantly impacted the ample funds in the market. On the banking side, both promissory notes and cash are exceptionally abundant, interbank lending is almost at a standstill, and the amount of cash handed over to national banks every day is also above 50 to 60 billion yuan, which shows the substantial cash reserves. After the No. 60 exchange results, from Monday to Friday, the deficit totaled more than 690 billion yuan, which also included a surplus of 22 billion yuan on Friday.

The exchange results of foreign banks showed that the surplus on Wednesday set a new record, reaching 327.8 billion yuan, and the deficit of 72.2 billion yuan on Friday was also rare since February. In total, the surplus in five days was 483 billion yuan, a significant decrease from the previous week.

(2) Internal and External Exchange Rates

Last week, the benchmark exchange rate for foreign exchange remained unchanged, but the Hong Kong exchange rate shrank sharply. On Monday, 100,000 legal tender yuan could be exchanged for 67 cents in Hong Kong dollars, but by Friday, it had shrunk to 48 cents, a decrease of one-third, which can be described as drastic. The highest price for Hong Kong U.S. dollar forward contracts was 5.69 yuan on Monday, and the lowest was 5.53 yuan on Friday. The market price of U.S. dollars was 5.60 Hong Kong dollars on Monday and also shrank to 5.44 Hong Kong dollars on Friday. The price of gold was 333 yuan per tael on Monday, which gradually decreased to 329 yuan on Thursday, but suddenly increased to 340 yuan on Friday.

Last week, the exchange rate for Guangzhou remittance gradually increased. It was 80 yuan on Monday and had gradually increased to 140 yuan by Friday. The trend of the Xiamen exchange rate was roughly the same. It was 100 yuan on Monday, and although it once decreased to 80 yuan on Tuesday, it immediately increased afterward, reaching 120 yuan by Friday, reflecting the trend of funds flowing south again. The Chongqing exchange rate was at par on Monday, changed to a discount of 10 yuan on Tuesday, and the discount was 20 yuan from Wednesday to Friday. The Hankou exchange rate also increased, from par on Monday to 40 yuan on Friday. The Tianjin exchange rate remained unchanged during the week, maintaining a discount level of 50 yuan.

(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

At the beginning of this week, the Hong Kong exchange rate was reported to be tightening again, and the rumor of the opening up of foreign stocks was about to be implemented. This was obviously beneficial to the stock market, and people felt encouraged. Wing On Company was the first to advance, reaching a new high price of 2325 yuan, and other stocks also rose strongly. American Asiatic Company reached 4250, Tung Yick Company 621, and China Flour Mill 72, all reaching the upper limit of price increases. On Tuesday, due to the influx of hot money and the loose money supply, the trend turned upward again. Wing On Company approached the 2500 yuan mark, and all stocks showed a steady upward trend throughout the day. China Flour Mill reached the upper limit of price increases again, closing at 86.4. China Cement closed at 920, and Heng Fung at 471.5, also reaching the upper limit. On Wednesday, it was suddenly rumored that the Northeast circulating coupons could be exchanged upon entering the pass. Wing On Company showed even more brilliance, once reaching a new high price of 2650 yuan, showing unique color, and the trading volume was also the highest. The situation of other stocks fluctuated. The stock market on Thursday was in full swing, and the bullish momentum became more and more magnificent, actually reporting a full house of red. Wing On Company surpassed the 3800 mark, and 15 kinds such as King Lun Company all reached the upper limit of price increases. The trading volume increased dramatically, reaching 800 million yuan. After four days of continuous increases, waiting until Friday, the money supply still showed a loose trend. Wing On Company took a burst of energy and soared out of the 3,000 yuan mark, reaching a new high of 3025. Old bulls took profits at high prices and finally closed their positions. The table suddenly showed tension, and a sudden plunge occurred, falling sharply to 2830 yuan, closing at the lowest price of the day. Other stocks also fell one after another.

Due to the further contraction of the Hong Kong exchange rate and the soaring prices of financial items, Jardine Matheson rose to 3.93 million yuan, Union Insurance to 4.3 million yuan, and Wheelock Marden to 8.1 million yuan, all higher than before. On Tuesday, due to the crazy rise in the black market for financial commodities, foreign stocks also saw a straight-line rise. Wheelock Marden rose sharply by 70 million yuan compared to before, and Jardine Matheson and Union Insurance each rose by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Others such as Shanghai Brewery at 880,000, China Merchants at 460,000, and Shanghai Dockyards at 930,000, all rose. On Wednesday, the Hong Kong exchange rate shrank again, and the rising momentum became even more intense. Wheelock Marden rose by another 800,000 yuan, shouting 9.6 million yuan, approaching the 10 million mark. Union Insurance reached 5 million yuan, and Jardine Matheson 4.44 million yuan. On Thursday, the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to shrink, and since foreign stocks are denominated in Hong Kong dollars, it caused foreign stocks to continue to rise sharply. Jardine Matheson saw a high price of 4.78 million yuan, Union Insurance 5.8 million yuan, and Wheelock Marden reached the 10 million yuan mark. On Friday, it climbed to a new peak. Jardine Matheson once rose to 5.15 million yuan, and then it was heard that Chinese stocks had fallen, falling back to 5.06 million yuan; Union Insurance reached 6.05 million yuan, and Wheelock Marden crossed the 10 million mark, soaring to 11.8 million yuan. Shanghai Brewery shouted 1.04 million, Shanghai Dockyards 1.15 million, and China Merchants 520,000, all rising higher than the previous day.

Cotton Cloth Sales to the South Face Multiple Challenges, Future Remains Difficult to be Optimistic About

Although the transportation of cotton cloth to the south has been opened, the sales performance of various textile products to the south has not been very good. According to the cotton cloth dyeing and weaving industry, since the ban on transporting cotton cloth to the south in this city was lifted, people in the industry have been thinking about rushing to transport a large number of cotton cloths to the south in an attempt to make profits, but recently the market conditions in Hong Kong and Macao have been sluggish. Although there has been no price inversion, if they are transported from Shanghai, plus transportation costs, water freight, tariffs, and discount interest, labor, and other expenses, not only is it impossible to make a profit, but it is also necessary to suffer losses. Therefore, except for those who have already accepted deposits in the past, very few new transactions are being made, and new textile dyeing and weaving factories are being established in Hong Kong, and production and sales are increasing day by day, giving a huge blow to the sale of Shanghai cotton cloth to the south. As for Siam, the Philippines, Manila, and other places, although the cotton cloth market is still good, the competition from Japanese cotton cloth sales is quite fierce, and the future of our country's cotton cloth sales to the south is difficult to be optimistic about.

New Medicine and New Drugs

### New Treatment for Allergic Asthma

— Lai Houjun

After reading the article "Treatment for Asthma" by a doctor last time, I secretly thought that there are many patients with allergic bronchial asthma in recent years. European and American developed countries have been diligently researching allergic diseases for years. Good results have been achieved in the radical treatment of allergic asthma, and the specific desensitization therapy is used to radically cure asthma. It is not yet common in our country. Furthermore, I was repeatedly urged by friends to write about what I have learned and use various allergens for specific desensitization therapy and make it public to society. I hope to initiate discussion and hope to get guidance from experts in the country, or allow those suffering from this disease to have a deep understanding of it and know that this disease is not an incurable disease as previously thought.

Causes of Allergic Bronchial Asthma

That is, the patient is specifically allergic to one or more substances. When this allergen enters the human body, the reticuloendothelial system produces a sensitizing antibody that combines with the allergen to produce a histamine-like substance, resulting in asthma.

Allergen sources can be divided into two categories:

(1) Allergens produced in the body

For example, tonsillitis, sinusitis, chronic bronchitis, etc. Toxins secreted by pathogens.

(2) External factors

A: Indoor dust, airborne bacteria, pollen, etc.

B: Animal dander, hair, and their secretions, etc.

C: Various foods.

Among them, category A is the most important. It is the allergic factor for each patient. I have seen many patients who, after staying in a place full of dust and heavy gas for a moment, can cause continuous sneezing - the precursor to asthma.

Food allergies are more common in young children. Their allergies decrease with age. Almost all children under four or five years old suffer from food allergies. If their allergens can be detected and avoided, radical cure will be easy. Those who suffer from food allergies often have eczema, pruritus, and chronic indigestion. However, these are nothing more than allergic lesions of the skin and digestive tract.

Dr. Liang has discussed the symptoms in detail, so I will not repeat them here.

Treatment

(1) Specific therapy (radical cure)

A. Avoidance method

This method is the most reliable. If you can completely avoid contact with allergens, you will not relapse. After a few years, the sensitivity to that allergen can be reduced.

For patients who are allergic to dust and pollen inhaled into the respiratory tract, an electric dust remover produced in the United States can be used to remove dust from the room. Then the asthma can be completely stopped within ten minutes. There are also specially made masks that can filter allergens in the air. This mask can be used during work or sleep.

The patient's bedroom should be high, airy, and full of sunlight. The furniture should be simple and clean. The pillows and mattresses should be lined with rubber cloth to prevent dust from spreading. Animals and insects should not be kept indoors.

B. Specific desensitization therapy

This method has been used in Europe and the United States for 50 years. Only the method of extracting allergens is not very accurate, so the effect is not as good as ideal. Since 1936, American experts studying this disease have made contributions every year, and there have also been inventions in pathology. Therefore, desensitization therapy for allergic diseases is as widely used as penicillin for suppurative diseases.

The method is: use various allergens to first make an intradermal test to detect which allergens the patient reacts to. After that, use each of these allergens for desensitization therapy. As for technical issues, considerable experience is required, otherwise it can promote the onset of the disease. This therapy takes a considerable amount of time, about half a year to a year, to have satisfactory results.

Some people think that there are many kinds of allergens, which are difficult to test. In fact, there are several principles to follow. The most common allergens are only sixty or seventy kinds. And each patient has only four or five kinds of allergens. It is not as complicated as imagined. However, various laboratory tests are still needed to assist in treatment.

For those whose asthma is caused by local lesions in the upper respiratory tract, surgical operations and vaccine injections are used to treat them.

(2) Symptomatic treatment

It is also very important. It can not only alleviate the patient's pain during attacks and shorten their course but also an important assistance during the radical cure period. However, various drugs have their side effects. A small dose is ineffective, and an excessive dose is harmful. Only the doctor can prescribe medication according to the individual's condition. Therefore, I will not discuss it in detail.

Emerging antihistaminic drugs

Such as Benadryl, Pyribenzamine, Thiodiphenylamine derivatives, etc. However, this type of drug is still in the trial period, and its efficacy is very temporary, and it has considerable side effects. But after continuous research and reform by experts, I think there will be satisfactory efficacy in the near future.

Changing residence for treatment

It is very suitable for patients to move to the mountains.

### Hookworm is Still Not Scary

— Shen Songnian

After reading Mr. Wang Wanbai's masterpiece "Hookworm Disease, the Enemy of the Countryside" in the 60th issue of this publication a month ago, I was very interested. I am currently a doctor in the Xiangshan Health Experimental Area of the Suzhou Local Disease Prevention and Control Institute. This is a famous endemic area of Japanese schistosomiasis. A few days ago, we examined the health conditions of children in various schools and found that nearly 70% of them were sick. The others are not all strong, and most of them are malnourished and underdeveloped. The diseases are mostly abdominal pain, bloody stools, accompanied by trachoma, stomatitis, otitis media, dental caries, skin diseases... If children in all schools across the country are mostly going to school with diseases like this, the future masters of the country will be so unhealthy, what future does the Republic of China have!

According to the examination of the feces of 184 school-age children in this area last year, as many as 144 people suffered from intestinal parasitic diseases, including Japanese schistosomiasis, ginger fluke, roundworm, hookworm, whipworm, etc. Because the students' parents are farmers, most of them do not know hygiene, and drinking raw water when thirsty has become a habit. All kinds of pollutants are thrown into the river, the toilet buckets are washed in the river, and water is also taken from the river. In places where there are already intestinal parasitic diseases, intestinal parasitic diseases are naturally prevalent. Originally, intestinal parasitic diseases were not serious. If the deworming treatment is reasonable, the patient's body can be relieved and health can be restored. Only Japanese schistosomiasis is the real enemy of the countryside today. Because once infected, there is no specific medicine today. Injecting Fuacin can only kill its male worms, and the female worms are not affected at all. It can only temporarily stop the disease, but it cannot cure the patient. As for the 2% potassium antimony tartrate solution, start with half a cc and inject it intravenously, adding half a cc every day until it reaches five cc on the tenth day and stop. In this disease, after the liver and spleen are enlarged, it is not only ineffective, but also has a fatal danger.

Hookworm, originally named: Anchylostomiasis, that is, duodenal worm, has four hook teeth on its mouth, bites the intestinal mucosa, and takes the host's nutrients for life. It does not "suck human blood" as Wang said. If they directly suck human blood, they can survive everywhere in people's liver, lungs, and other internal organs. Imagine what way out hookworm patients have? The circulatory system, lungs, liver, etc. are only the paths they invade, and the small intestine is their growth place. Because they must rely on the nutrients in the small intestine to survive, although their eggs are small, they are not as small as bacteria, so they can be clearly seen under a microscope at more than 100 times: oval-shaped eggs, thin, colorless shells, with four egg bacteria inside. Like welcoming a pair of dumbbell shapes, there are also deformed ones, with only two egg cells. The nails of patients with this disease are pale red or pale yellow, thin and fragile, the tips are easy to crack, and the surface is uneven, turning towards the back of the finger, which is its characteristic. Patients like foreign objects. After the disease is cured, most of them are normal. The earlier the deworming, the faster the recovery. But in the late stage, when there is edema and a tendency to bleed, deworming drugs are difficult to use, and the prognosis is often poor.

Reasonable deworming therapy: (You must first test the stool)

(1) Take Mag Sulfuric 20.0 before going to bed

(2) Take Oil Chenopod 20-30 drops in capsules or starch paper for easy administration on an empty stomach the next morning.

(3) Two hours after taking the above medicine, take Mag Sulfuric 20.0 again

Repeat it every other day or continuously until the stool does not find the eggs of this worm. Children under the age of fifteen can use 0.03 cc per year of age, but if this medicine stays in the intestine for a long time, it is easy to cause symptoms of poisoning such as numbness, spasms, tinnitus, and deafness. Patients with heart and kidney disease are particularly prone to poisoning and should pay attention to administration. Mr. Wang advocates using a total of fifteen drops of this medicine, divided into three doses and taken three hours apart. I think: the dosage is too small. According to the regulations, 20 drops should be the starting dose, and it can be used up to 35 drops. Mr. Wang also advocates taking it again in two weeks to eradicate the roots. In fact, it is also impossible. If you are afraid of side effects, severe heart and kidney diseases cannot be used at all. I wonder if Mr. Wang thinks so? The air is fresh, the climate is high and cool, and the temperature changes are not drastic. Humid weather and large cities with frequent heavy fog are not suitable for asthma patients to live in.

Prognosis

After the allergen is detected, contact should be completely avoided. And use special desensitization therapy, which is very effective. Most patients can be completely cured.

According to recent American medical journals, statistics from American hospitals show that allergic diseases account for about 20%-30%. It mostly occurs in childhood, or first suffers from eczema, pruritus, and then asthma. Young children often suffer from insufficient breast milk, supplemented with milk cake, and additional sugar feeding. This kind of incompletely digested protein and polysaccharide molecules can enter the underdeveloped intestinal wall of children, produce allergic symptoms, and cause the intestinal wall to degenerate. After that, they are easily sensitive to food. Therefore, infants should not be given hard food before six months of age. Human milk should be the main food, otherwise it should be replaced with cow's milk. Don't save money and leave infants with diseases.

### Answering Questions from Patients Regarding "Ebesal"

— Xu Jin

I wrote an article "A Good Medicine for Pulmonary Tuberculosis" before, mentioning "Ebesal" ("Bayer") (see this publication on April 30). I originally wanted to contribute a fool's opinion to stimulate discussion among colleagues. Indeed, this is not yet a specific medicine for pulmonary tuberculosis, but just an auxiliary agent such as calcium injections. It only promotes the calcification of lesions. Dr. Liang Junqing's annotation "The side effects are very large, do not use it indiscriminately without the help of an expert" is also a fact. Unexpectedly, patients have sent letters asking questions one after another, and they are all forwarded by the Medical Association. There are several cases every day. Although those who inquire all enclose postage, some have unknown mailing addresses and cannot be replied to. Now I will answer them all here together. If subsequent people want to ask questions in person, please send them directly to my clinic at No. 13, Lane 364, Xinhua Road (23) in this city, or collect them from the second floor of the Zhongxi Pharmacy at No. 676 Kangding Road (intersection of Changde Road) between 10 am and 12 noon.

### The Way to Use Money

— Ji Yong

When Chinese people write articles, their minds are very clear and complex, such as the principles of "to capture first, to coax and flatter," "to suppress before praising," and "to apply powder to the back" are truly "ancient," and are used very skillfully and beautifully, so they left us descendants so many masterpieces that sound like gold and stone when thrown. Unfortunately, those who can speak may not be able to act, especially when it comes to using money, it seems that they do not understand the method at all.

In fact, it doesn't matter if the article is poorly written, at least there will be no disaster. As for using money, there are many troubles and problems. The reason is that money is something that everyone needs to use. Those who know how to use it will not only benefit themselves but also prevent others from being exhausted because of you, which is what the Japanese devils often said, "coexistence and co-prosperity." Those who don't know how to use it, on the surface, seem to enjoy themselves very much, but every enjoyment deprives some people of some vitality. As time goes by, it will definitely turn into great hatred, which is the biggest source of all turmoil and unrest.

Confucianism only gives people extremely general lessons, saying what "gentlemen understand righteousness, villains understand profit." So "Zi rarely speaks of profit," and Mencius even criticized King Hui of Liang because of this. In fact, how can profit be rarely mentioned, and how can nourishing be compared? Isn't this completely empty talk? Reading this kind of teaching too much will definitely turn people into hypocrites. On the surface, they don't talk about money, but in their bones, they pounce on money. Today's corrupt officials will all talk about a set of benevolence and righteousness, and I am afraid they are all trained by the teachings of Confucius and Mencius. As for Taoism, that's even worse. They only know that money is the source of all evil, and advocate "not seeing what is desirable, so that the heart will not be disturbed," and say "five colors make people's eyes blind, five sounds make people's ears deaf, and five flavors make people's mouths refreshed." This is like "there is no silver buried here," the more you say it, the more you steal. Since society already has money, and money can buy everything, unless the whole world has a thorough revolution against money, otherwise, if you want to deny its existence in an Ah Q-style way, it will never succeed.

But Confucianism has the saying "a brave man cuts off his wrist when a viper bites his hand." To remove a limb to save the whole body, weighing the gains and losses, is ultimately worth it. Although the body, hair, and skin are received from parents and should not be damaged, at this time you can't talk too much. The body is like this, why not use money? Chinese people—especially wealthy Chinese people—rarely think about this. Sometimes, for the sake of their concubine's illness, or their own syphilis and diabetes, their son's smallpox and typhoid fever, they make vows and donate a certain number of cotton clothes in winter, or benefit monks and Taoists, and perform a complete water and land ceremony, as if they are the greatest of great compassion Amitabha Buddha, but the birth, old age, sickness, and death of his concubine and young master and even himself are not controlled by others. If the old man in the sky also flatters the rich, and insists on not letting him get sick, are the poor waiting to freeze to death and starve to death? Therefore, even in terms of selfishness and self-interest, this has fallen to the lowest level, not to mention that most people will cancel this little charity under the slogan of "breaking superstition"? A friend once made a comparison, he said, for example, there are five cups of tea, and ten people are all thirsty and want to drink. Naturally, those who are quick and powerful will grab them. In foreign countries, one person may drink two cups, and the remaining three cups are divided among nine people, one cup for three people. Although it is not quenching their thirst, it can also generate saliva. But in China, it is not like this. One person drinks three cups in a row, and although I don't drink the rest, others don't want it, and it is poured on the ground and becomes mud! I think this comparison is very appropriate. To give an example of Shanghai alone, I don't know how much clean water is poured on the ground every day and turned into mud, while most people are dying of thirst there, but no one cares. Can this last?

We have seen American oil tycoons and steel tycoons donate millions to social undertakings without stinginess. Many Chinese people must be secretly scolding them as fools, "If I had so much money, I wouldn't do this!" But in fact, the Rockefeller and Carnegie families have never become poor because of these donations. On the contrary, their careers and safety are more firmly guaranteed because of this. This is the expression of Europeans and Americans using money better than we do. It must be known that within a country, if so-called wealthy families can have such a long-term vision, several worries will disappear into nothing, and revolution and bloodshed will be useless. I always feel that revolution is a last resort for mankind, and even revolutionaries themselves will not be proud of it. Why can social policy replace social revolution in other countries, but not in China? Those who have money should think about this.

When I was young, I read Tao Yuanming's letters to his son Yanzhi and others, teaching his son to treat servants well, "This is also a child, and should be treated kindly." This is very admirable. Thinking about it today, the Chinese family seems to take mistreating servants as the principle, and treating servants as "people" as the exception. From Tao Gong's words, it reflects the bastardness of all intellectuals! Because there is absolutely no rule in the world that "servants must not be treated as people," then Tao Gong's letter is not worth mentioning! However, today's rich people are taking giving away a few cotton clothes as a merit, but forgetting that this is a true self-interest. If even this self-interest cannot deeply understand the truth and make it more effective and profound, then their personal tragedy is inevitable!

### Grand Assembly Exercise

— You Mojun

On the three sides of the stands, looking over, they were high and low, wriggling and moving, all heads, countless. Even with good eyesight, I am afraid you would not be able to count them all. What men, women, old, young, tall, short, closer ones could be vaguely distinguished, but the distant corners could not be clearly distinguished. As far as the eye could see, one only knew that those wriggling things were heads. Those people naturally also included some standing and some walking, but looking over, one could not distinguish them clearly. And who could tell whether there were relatives and friends of mine in this ant-like crowd?

In the sports field, the athletes from various places, amidst the colorful flags, orderly divided into two wings and withdrew. The field was instantly empty, leaving only a group of Shanghai middle school students directly in front of the podium. How many people there were could not be counted; whether they were male or female could not be seen clearly. Looking over, all that could be seen were white hats on their heads, white shirts on their upper bodies, blue shorts on their lower bodies, and white canvas shoes on their feet. White, blue, white, all the same color, without exception. They hid in the corner of the square, as if waiting quietly for something.

Suddenly, with a command from the podium, the magnificent scene unfolded. Unhurried and unhurried, both orderly and neat, ten thousand legs lifted in unison, moving forward, forward, straight to the front of the podium. A large area of the square was instantly filled with countless energetic youths. When they marched, it was said to be like a tide, but not quite, because when the tide rises, the back waves push the front waves, not so lightly and quickly, but turbulent. When they stood still, it was said to be like stars scattered across the sky, but not quite, because how could the scattering of stars and the arrangement of chess pieces be so neat and orderly? With difficulty, one could only say that it was like a large carpet with a patterned blue and white design slowly unfolding on the field, until it covered the entire area.

The music sounded, and the grand assembly exercise began. White hats, white shoes, white shirts, and blue shorts, as if possessing souls, moved in unison with the melody of the music, moving lightly and neatly. At this time, the heads in the stands no longer wriggled; the ten thousand hands raised on the field, the sections of red lotus root protruding from the white hats, dazzled the eyes! One moment, ten thousand palms struck in unison, and the sound was like thousands of pieces of silk being torn at the same time, emitting such a crisp sound! Another moment, they bent down, rising and falling with the cadence of the music, again dazzling the eyes. This could be compared to the vast square being a sea, and at this time it was calm and sunny, and the rising and falling were the light waves on the sea, and only light waves could be said, not turbulent waves!

The music rose and fell, fast and slow, the movements turned with measure. Suddenly the music stopped, and an uncountable number of white hats, white shoes, white shirts, and blue shorts, a group of energetic youths, stood still on the field. Then the audience in the stands let out a breath, and then wriggled and moved, and the applause around them was like the thunder of spring, and even if you had the strength of ten thousand jun, you could not stop it. I was so moved that I was about to cry!

### Women's Rights

— Nian Hong

Recently, I had the opportunity to visit a free night school for the public, which several young friends were working hard to support. To be honest, I am most opposed to visits of this kind, because during a visit, not only do those being visited feel uneasy, but the visitors being led around by the administrative officer and the chief officer also feel ashamed for having invaded the natural lives of others. Moreover, after touring around like one casually viewing flowers, apart from the cleanliness of the toilets and the charts on the walls being clear at a glance, it is difficult to obtain any other results. As usual, it is just a perfunctory "very good" and "thank you."

I know the efforts of these young friends very well, but the result of a hurried visit is that one cannot see even a fraction of their achievements, because I understand that they do not yet know how to decorate the façade, such as making the students bow at a full ninety degrees, etc. But just based on this superficial observation, I have seen to some extent that the patriarchal ideas of the poor people in this big city are still stubbornly present and very firmly entrenched.

Each classroom probably has forty students, but I can guarantee that at least thirty or so of them are girls. This specifically illustrates how this generation of parents still discriminates against girls, or at least does not regard them as having the same right to education as boys. I took the opportunity to secretly ask a younger girl about her family situation. She told me shyly that one of her younger brothers had been sent to a nearby elementary school, while she had not finished the third grade before transferring to this free night school. I understand the parents' difficulties, and what surprises me is that even the girl, who is only thirteen or fourteen years old, seems to understand them very well. She said precociously: "It is right for my younger brother to study. I am lucky to be able to study at the night school. When my older sister was my age, she had already gone to work in a cigarette factory."

### Writer

— Ruzi

The prolific writer Sinclair, when studying at university, wrote 8,000 words for magazines every night, and during the day he still had to attend lectures for eight hours.

He once abandoned an income of seventy yuan per issue and ran to the Jesse region to set up a tent, burying himself for five years to complete five novels. Although these five books only sold for a thousand dollars, he didn't care at all.

The famous novelist Nan Geli's masterpiece, "Desert Tradition," was rejected by publishers six times.

His writing attitude is very strict. A novel always takes several months. Whether it is changing the plot or changing the characters' personalities, he is willing to expend great effort.

### Miscellaneous Poems of Chronicle

— Shi Shufan

Teeth fallen, beard gray, taste understood of itself, how can one entrust emotions to spring buds! Wild words are not surprising from Chen Tongfu, he has not understood Shaoling or Jiannan.

River tower lightly drunk, what clearness in the night? One guest silently listens to discussions of war, under the lamp secretly turns over records of places, only saddened that no place has a state's name.

Silently green sky, upright body, above the tower breathing the dust of war, silently white dew flows with sharp edges, stars angry at the people in the lower world.

Lying idly in the wild mountains, too lazy to go out, yesterday followed the flowing water past the former village, the taste of rivers and lakes fades in middle age, even dreams are few, to say nothing of wine stains.

Poetic heart flows and joins as ripples, the land is near but meeting is difficult, but this soul-stirring sky is also drunk, sitting later under Jade Screen Mountain.

Red bookworms scattering after the catastrophe, tablets of the Six Dynasties and writings of the late Qing, the sound of hooves and the shadows of sedan chairs on the Hengtang road, trampling disorderly the clear box, not as good as painting.

Withered grass and long streets, wilderness filling the eyes, cloth shoes frozen and slippery with thick frost, coming to drink Datong wine in the third watch, is not the border pass moon also yellow.

Ten thousand trees arrayed as soldiers, as if they could be waved, floating thunder as drums to embolden the return east, Heaven takes pity on heroic dreams, temporarily allows green mountains to break through in disorder.

Mr. Di Chuqing, whose name was Bao Xian, was from a distinguished family in Liyang. In his youth, he was handsome and forthright. Together with Liu Yang, Tang Caichang, Liang Qichao of Xinhui, and others, he engaged in the reform movement. His creation of the Shibao (Eastern Times) after the Gengzi year (1900) echoed the Xinmin Congbao (New Citizen Journal) of Liang Rengong (Liang Qichao), serving as a pioneer of the cultural movement. In middle age, he devoted himself to literature and art and the newspaper industry, abandoning politics. He also indulged in Chan Buddhism, often worshiping Buddha and feeling compassion for the world. In his spare time, he cultivated his mind through calligraphy and painting, not for fame or profit, so his craftsmanship became more specialized and authentic. His unique style was quite different from the trends of the time, being both vigorous and refined, comparable to Dai Chunshi and Zhang Ziqing of the late Qing Dynasty. He did not easily paint for others, and few people knew about it. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China (1926), when the Shibao had been taken over by Mr. Huang Bohui, Chu Lao (Di Chuqing) specially sent me two folding fans with his own paintings and calligraphy. One painted "A few crows in the setting sun, a stream winding around a lonely village," with the meaning of the words, and the other painted "Clear stream and wild gulls, distant mountains with Chen willows," inscribed with "Fame and profit are far overseas, right and wrong do not reach the wild gulls." Both scenes were clear and elegant, the colors were refined, the water birds chased in groups, and the sky geese lined up in formation, only with the tip of the brush and a little ink, slightly dotted on the paper, they were lifelike. It was definitely not something that mediocre hands and shallow learning could achieve. Because he collected many famous works of the Song and Yuan dynasties, he usually observed, studied, and copied them, understanding them in his heart and having a secret of his own. He also had his own joy, never selling paintings, and never telling others about his ability to paint. The reason he made these for me was only because I had served the Shibao for many years, and he voluntarily gave them to me as a memento, and instructed me not to show them to others. Before this, I only knew that Chu Lao could write well, and did not know that his painting was so wonderful. Both pieces of calligraphy, one in regular script (copying the Thirteen Lines of Luoshen) and one in running script, were matched with Xiangfei bamboo fan ribs, all with elegant colors, and I still treasure them carefully today.

Chu Lao's calligraphy learned from Chu Suiliang, magnificent and elegant, with a lofty bearing and comfortable brushwork, a clear and pure air that strikes the eyebrows. Among the famous calligraphers of the Tang Dynasty, such as Yan Zhenqing, Liu Gongquan, and Huai Su, there were many learners, but the styles of Chu Suiliang and Yu Shinan were the most difficult to learn. Chu Suiliang's writing has many risky strokes. Zhao Shijun, whose style name was Shengbo, of Jiangxi, was a skilled follower of Chu Suiliang. He once wrote a biography for Madam Di Wang Guanding. Zhao was a close friend of Di. Di specialized in Yu Shinan, both of which were difficult for people, but they were equally skillful and worthy of being passed down to the world.

After the "September 18th Incident," the ferocious faces of the Japanese invaders were fully exposed, and the unprecedented national crisis was even greater than before. Gu Weijun took on a major responsibility, first accompanying the Lytton Commission out of the customs, facing the threats of the Japanese "puppet" regime, and going through all kinds of hardships. Then he went to Geneva to appeal to the League of Nations. The Japanese government, fearing Gu's prestige, knew that Fang Ze Qianji was no match for him, so it sent Matsuoka Yosuke as its representative. Matsuoka was also a student who had studied in the United States, graduating from Oregon State University. He later served as president and vice president of the South Manchuria Railway, and had always advocated aggression. He was also a beautiful talker and eloquent, with a sharp mind and cunning thoughts. At Geneva, he spoke without restraint, often comparing China to the Boxers, hoping to use alarming words to stir up the views of Westerners, and his tone was extremely尖酸毒辣. Our representative, Dr. Gu, responded with a calm attitude and clever rebuttals, treating him like a child, playing with him in the palm of his hand. When Matsuoka was triumphant and chattering endlessly, Dr. Gu only listened with a smile, not responding directly, but attacking the enemy's weaknesses, often using one or two old examples to counter his hundreds, making the representatives of various countries unable to help but smile. Matsuoka turned red in the face. Later, the majority of member states voted to declare Japan an aggressor nation and denied the existence of the puppet state of "Manchukuo." Matsuoka and his government were ashamed and angry, and withdrew from the League of Nations, thereby doubling their perverse actions, leading to the July 7th Incident, full-scale invasion, followed by the Pacific War, and finally collapsing and surrendering.
