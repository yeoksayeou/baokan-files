### President Chiang Launches National Thrift and Construction Movement as a Citizen, Broadcast Appeal to the Nation's Military and Civilians to Unite and Promote it, Reforming Society and Eliminating Two Major Threats

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] President Chiang delivered a broadcast speech at 9:00 PM on the 15th, calling on the nation's military and civilians to jointly launch a National Thrift and Construction Movement to complement the implementation of the previously announced emergency financial and economic measures, serving as the starting point for social reform. The outline of the National Thrift and Construction Movement was drafted by Huang Shao-gu, Peng Zhao-xian, Gu Zheng-gang, and others. The President attached great importance to this, so he decided to announce it via broadcast. However, due to the President's busy schedule, staff from the Central Broadcasting Station went to Beijige at 4:00 PM on the 15th to record the President's address. During the 9:00 PM broadcast, all military personnel and civilians across the country were able to respectfully listen to the President's earnest and sincere instructions.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] President Chiang, contributing one-tenth of his personal assets, launched the National Thrift and Construction Movement and broadcast the outline of the movement to the compatriots nationwide at 9:00 PM on the 15th on the Central Broadcasting Station. The original text is recorded as follows:

Today, China's most pressing need is to relieve the people's suffering and stabilize social order. To achieve this goal, we must first quell the rebellion of the treacherous Communist bandits and accelerate the victory of the bandit suppression campaign. This is the unanimous wish of all compatriots nationwide and the shared responsibility of all compatriots nationwide. Therefore, all compatriots nationwide must recognize the gravity of this responsibility and the arduousness of this mission. We must all grit our teeth, summon our courage, and work together with one heart and one mind, being diligent and thrifty, to overcome this final difficult hurdle of our national revolution and achieve our common goal.

Compatriots, everyone must also know that the great calamity of our nation and the great enemy of national construction lie not only in the troubles caused by the treacherous bandits and the economic decline but also in the speculative manipulations and extravagant excesses of the parasitic class. In particular, the selfishness, waste, luxury, decadence, and corruption of the exploiting elements have affected the morale of the nation and created social injustice. As the saying goes, "Diligence and thrift are the foundation of self-cultivation." A Western proverb also says, "Luxury is the great enemy of national construction." We must first overcome this internal great enemy, renounce luxury, eliminate corruption, advocate frugality, and actively engage in construction before the bandit suppression and pacification work can be thoroughly completed. Therefore, today, I, Zhongzheng, initiate the National Thrift and Construction Movement as a citizen and formulate the outline of the movement, hoping to use the common flow of society to wash away the dregs of society and lay the foundation for victory in suppressing the rebellion and success in national construction. I earnestly hope that all compatriots nationwide will rise up together to promote this movement, rigorously implement this outline, and fulfill the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation for everyone.

Outline of the National Thrift and Construction Movement

(1) Key Points of the Promoting Thrift and Building the Nation Movement After the victory of China's War of Resistance against Japan, we encountered two major threats: one is the full-scale rebellion of the violent group of treacherous Communist bandits, and the other is the economic devastation and social injustice caused by the rebellion of the treacherous bandits. Whether these two major threats can be eliminated will determine the success or failure of the construction of our New China and even the fate of the survival of the Chinese nation.

Today, all patriotic military personnel and civilians across the country are engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the public enemy of the nation and the country—the traitorous Communist bandits. The majority of the people, who are struggling on the brink of starvation, are contributing money and effort, shedding blood and sweat, to support the war to suppress the rebellion and save the country. However, some parasitic classes who do not work or produce, as well as speculators who hoard and manipulate and use all illegal means to seize wealth, live extravagant and dissolute lives. They not only destroy the country's productive forces but also create a decadent atmosphere of social corruption, which affects the morale of the nation and the morale of suppressing the rebellion.

In order to correct this unreasonable phenomenon, in order to thoroughly implement total warfare, concentrate the nation's manpower, financial resources, and material resources, and exert a high degree of efficiency to ensure the victory of suppressing the rebellion and the success of national construction, we cannot but awaken the self-awareness and self-control of the social parasitic class and speculators, and make a great effort in the two words "diligence and thrift," eradicate the bad habits of laziness and dissipation, work hard with the laboring masses, increase production, save on consumption, repay the country, and fulfill the natural duty of citizens. This is the key point of our launching of the Thrift and National Building Movement. This movement is not only the starting point for changing the atmosphere and reforming society but also a part of the general mobilization work for suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. Under the banner of this movement, we hope that everyone will achieve the following two points: "Reduce the consumption of public and private life to the lowest limit," and "Maximize the work, production, and combat power."

### Soldier-like Life at the Front, Civilian-like Life in the Rear to Guarantee the Success of the Cause of Suppressing Rebellion and Building the Nation

Mission of the Movement

(2) Mission of the Thrift and National Building Movement

The Thrift and National Building Movement is the practice of the national revolution at the current stage. Its historical mission is to call on all patriots to jointly promote the spirit of self-reliance, self-help, self-strengthening, and self-control, practice a life of diligence and hard work, and, by means of persuasion, influence, and service, extend this to others, so that society forms a spontaneous and self-controlled binding force to correct the tendency of the polarization of rich and poor lifestyles, in order to gradually achieve the goal of soldier-like life at the front and civilian-like life in the rear.

Economically, the Thrift and National Building Movement is intended to enable the entire society to eliminate the excessive inequality of enjoyment due to the restraint of life and the economy of consumption. Due to the popularization of labor and the improvement of efficiency, gradual increases in production can be achieved, that is, on the one hand, to coordinate our people's way of life with the economic capabilities of the people, prevent the extravagant material life of merchants, wealthy merchants, gentry, and prominent officials, and on the other hand, to encourage labor, strengthen production, develop national economic construction, and accumulate the potential for national defense construction, especially at present, due to the prohibition of waste, the effects of stabilizing prices, consolidating currency values, and balancing international payments can be achieved.

Politically, the Thrift and National Building Movement is intended to use the practice of diligent production and hardworking living as an effective means to eradicate corruption and improve efficiency, especially to thoroughly implement total warfare, and to make the nation's manpower, financial resources, and material resources as much as possible meet the needs of the military, in order to strengthen the combat effectiveness of the national army and quell the internal rebellion as soon as possible. At the same time, under the goal of soldier-like life at the front and civilian-like life in the rear, the military and the people, the generals and the soldiers, the officials and the people, and the poor and the rich are brought together by the proximity of living standards, which promotes psychological unity and consistency in action, so that the whole country is united and becomes a strong fighting body to ensure the success of the cause of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation.

After listening to the report, the President also gave some instructions.

### Revolutionary Social Movement Must Have a Strong Organization, Starting with Shanghai and Beijing as a Demonstration

(5) Organization of the Thrift and National Building Movement

1. The Thrift and National Building Movement is a revolutionary social movement. It must have a plan and a strong organization to be responsible for promoting it, and this organization must be a spontaneous and automatic people's organization.

2. In order to make the organization sound and powerful, it is necessary to adopt a gradual expansion method. The phased organizational work should start from Beijing, Shanghai, and major cities as a demonstration. When there is a success, it will gradually be extended to other areas.

3. Before establishing an organization in each region, the principle of "taking action as a call" should be followed, and universal and effective publicity work should be carried out. It must also go through a full and planned preparatory stage. The preparation work should be carried out from the central to the local level. The personnel responsible for the preparation must have the "conditions of setting an example and the spirit of serving selflessly."

4. The Thrift and National Building Movement should have a sound basic organization as the basic force for achieving the various tasks of this movement. The number of people in each basic organization should not exceed 15, so as to ensure reliable contact and flexible action.

5. Any social person who pledges to act in accordance with the pledges of the Thrift and National Building Movement and meets the prescribed standards can participate in the organization of the Thrift and National Building Movement, but must first participate in its basic organization, and it must be voluntary, and must have the determination to practice personally and the guarantee of their own thrifty behavior. In the process of organizational development, the responsible personnel should strictly abide by the principle of "rather be short than indiscriminate." If members who violate the long pledges are found in the organization, they must be punished after verification, and the disguised corrupt members and sensational speculators inside should be eliminated to ensure the purity of the organization.

6. Every member of the organization must undergo self-examination, mutual supervision, and common encouragement. Not only must they practice personally, but they must also play a leading role and expand their influence. In particular, they must encourage relatives and friends who meet the prescribed standards to actively participate in the organization, so that this movement can develop in a radiative manner.

7. In addition to conducting activities in the region, the basic organization should also be universally carried out in factories, shops, schools, troops, agencies, societies, and professional groups. When there are several basic organizations in the same region or department, a liaison organization should be established to strengthen the grassroots work of this movement.

8. When the organizational work in the same area reaches a considerable level, a central organization should be established in that area to lead the promotion of the Thrift and National Building Movement in that area.

9. The central hub of the Thrift and National Building Movement organization should be located in the capital city, and it should be responsible for leading all levels of organizations across the country to promote this movement.

Publicity and Promotion

(6) Promotion of the Thrift and National Building Movement

1. Before the Thrift and National Building Movement is launched, universal and in-depth publicity should be carried out to make the majority of the people understand that this is a revolutionary social movement that eliminates injustice, understand the close relationship between this movement and the people's own interests, and ignite the enthusiasm to welcome this movement.

2. Enthusiastically welcome the working masses to join the organization to enrich the Thrift and National Building Movement, give the working masses honor and spiritual encouragement, make them play a demonstration role, and make them form an organized moral force by participating in this movement, especially to let them have the right to criticize and report any lazy and extravagant elements, and exert the great role of moral sanctions.

3. The Thrift and National Building Movement and the government's measures to mobilize to suppress the rebellion and build the country, the plan to reform the monetary system and manage the economy and finance, and the laws to eliminate corruption and clarify governance must be closely linked and coordinated, so that automatic awareness and reflection and passive persuasion and compulsion complement each other.

4. In order to cooperate with the actions of the working masses in reporting and criticizing the lazy and extravagant elements in society, the public opinion circles across the country should be mobilized to continuously impose sanctions on those who violate the pledges of the Thrift and National Building Movement, and announce the names and extravagant and wasteful facts of these elements in newspapers or radio stations, creating a new atmosphere, so that the general public believes that excessive luxury and enjoyment is a disgraceful behavior. At the same time, we should do our best to praise those clean and diligent civil and military officials and the frugal gentry and cultural, educational, and business circles, give them spiritual encouragement and comfort, so as to play a role in changing the atmosphere in society.

5. We must make a correct estimate of the working object, the objective environment, and the possible limitations. For different occupations, different classes, and different living conditions, we must determine the steps, plans, and contents of each work. That is, we must formulate policies based on people, things, time, and place. All plans must be specific and feasible, and even slogans must be higher than reality. It is absolutely not allowed to become official documents and exam-oriented dogma. Do not start things lightly that cannot be done, but once the work to be promoted has been decided, you must concentrate all your efforts, eliminate all difficulties, and carry it through to the end.

6. Review and study at all times, obtain valuable experience from work, correct the mistakes that have been made, and truly grasp the correctness of the Thrift and National Building Movement. We must use perseverance, perseverance, and enthusiasm to make this great movement deep, universal, and lasting. (End)

Editorial

### Sending the Special Envoy Delegation from Korea to the Philippines and the United States

The Korean President Dr. Syngman Rhee's special envoy delegation to the Philippines and the United States, headed by Special Envoy Zhao Bingyu, set off on the 9th of this month, arrived in Shanghai via Japan on the 11th, and arrived in Nanjing the next morning, paying respects to President Chiang. They returned to Shanghai on the 14th and were warmly welcomed by all sectors of the city yesterday. They will fly to the Philippines this afternoon. We listened to Special Envoy Zhao's speech at the welcome tea party yesterday and were deeply moved. Now we casually write a few words as a farewell message.

As Special Envoy Zhao said, "The expansion of international communism today has made the establishment of the Republic of Korea extremely difficult." Is it just Korea that is like this? In the past two or three years, the Chinese people have defeated the invading Japanese pirates, but they still cannot enjoy the fruits of victory. The flames of war are everywhere, and disasters are rampant. Isn't this also due to the expansion of international communism? The reason why international communism conflicts with national independence is less due to communism itself and more due to its complete command by the Communist International. Under the command of the Communist International, China is an ideal arena for its expanding forces, and Korea is a forward position for its contest with democratic countries in the Far East. Therefore, on the day the Republic of Korea was established, North Korea formed its own separatist government under the aegis of the Soviet Union. This clearly hinders the unification of Korea and carries the danger of Korea becoming a powder keg in the Far East in the future. The purpose of this special envoy delegation's visit abroad is to thank the three countries, but its real task is to "unite peace-loving people all over the world to complete the independence and unification of Korea." This is what Special Envoy Zhao has clearly stated, and we deeply hope for the success of this trip. This is the first point.

China and Korea have always been brothers. For thousands of years, their feelings have been deep. Korea has coexisted with China for two or three thousand years and still exists, but it was annexed by Japan after less than twenty or thirty years of coexistence. The Korean people suffered the pain of national subjugation for nearly forty years. After the war, they were able to form a government and declare independence early because the Allied countries implemented the Cairo Declaration. While our people deeply congratulate Korea, they must be able to appreciate how the warlord imperialism of Japan in the past disturbed the peace of the East. As a plan to punish the past and be careful for the future, the people of China and Korea must permanently and sincerely join hands and unite strongly to prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression. The so-called Japanese aggressive forces are not just military forces. Its aggressive economic groups and the ideological roots of aggression should all be thoroughly eradicated. It is said that Japan is lying in wait, plotting to come back, and the American authorities in charge of the Allied Control may not be able to see into the lungs of the Japanese. Once they are overly indulgent, there is a risk of repeated harm. China and Korea should jointly take responsibility, using sincere calls to draw the attention of some American authorities and correct their mistaken ideas that have been deceived by Japanese warlords, bureaucrats, and even women. Since the power of the Allied Headquarters is in the hands of the United States, the special envoy delegation should do its best to formally inform the American government and the public not to overindulge the remnants of Japanese warlords and financial groups, leaving the seeds of disaster in East Asia. This is the second point.

Korean President Dr. Syngman Rhee has struggled tirelessly throughout his life for the independence of his motherland. Last April, he returned home from the United States, passing through Shanghai. The impression he left on the people of Shanghai was that he was not only a revolutionary politician but also a scholar with Han learning cultivation. Although Dr. Rhee has lived in the United States for a long time, he is proficient in ancient Chinese prose. Therefore, he is trustworthy, righteous, and not bound by utilitarianism or materialism. He uses a Chinese brush to write beautiful characters and recites good poems, and he is like a brother to the Chinese people. This time, the special envoy delegation is headed by Dr. Zhao Bingyu, who is a close friend of President Rhee. He also knows a lot of poetry by heart and writes beautiful characters. Their deep friendship with China is like one person. We are deeply saddened to bid farewell to the special envoy delegation today. We hope that after completing their mission in the Philippines and the United States, they will return with honor, pass through our country again, and we will do our best as hosts, invite them to stay in the scenic spots of China, sing and compose poetry, and be nurtured in the atmosphere of the long-standing Chinese culture for thousands of years, further enhancing their confidence in loving peace, and working together to maintain world peace, then this trip will be worthwhile. This is the third point.

Sailing thousands of miles, driving and singing quickly, we respectfully wish the Korean special envoy delegation a safe journey and a successful mission!

### The President Hosts a Farewell Banquet for Foreign Minister Wang: Our Attitude towards Various Issues at the United Nations General Assembly is Largely Determined; "Acting According to Circumstances" outside the Meeting

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 15th dispatch] Foreign Minister Wang is scheduled to come to Shanghai on the 16th and fly west to Europe on the 17th. President Chiang specially hosted a farewell banquet for him at his official residence on the afternoon of the 15th, and also hosted a reception for Zhang Yuejun, who had just returned from Japan. During the banquet, Mr. Zhang reported his impressions of his visit to Japan and provided his personal views on the early opening of the Japanese peace conference. The President attached great importance to this. According to authoritative sources, Foreign Minister Wang decided to take advantage of the opening of the UN General Assembly to "act according to circumstances" outside the meeting and hold consultations with foreign diplomats, including making exploratory efforts to convene a Japanese peace conference and discussing other pending issues between our country and other countries. According to reporters, our country's attitude towards various issues in this UN General Assembly has been largely determined. Only one or two important issues need to be finalized after the Foreign Minister arrives in Paris and listens to the reports of our country's officials in the United Nations delegation. Our country has high hopes for this UN General Assembly and will actively work with all countries to seek possible solutions that can be accepted by all, so that the two issues that were most controversial in the last session, namely, restricting the abuse of veto power and determining the control measures for electricity and atomic energy, can be resolved to some extent. In addition, on the Korean issue, we will fully support the report of the United Nations delegation to Korea and advocate assisting the democratically elected government of Korea to achieve true independence and seek unification. Regarding the Convention on Freedom of Information, our country believes that there should be no limits to freedom of the press and will suggest assisting the development of backward news industries in member states. Regarding the Small General Assembly, we may agree to its continued existence. As for the formulation of the International Declaration of Human Rights and the establishment of an international police force, our country will take an active stance. Our country's attitude towards the Balkan, Palestinian, and Kashmir regional issues will also remain unchanged.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 15th dispatch] The Control Yuan reviewed the report and attached comments by Control Commissioners Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin on the case of leaking secrets of the currency reform and selling Yongsha yarn, as well as the impeachment case they proposed, after it was sent to the Control Yuan on the 14th. The Control Yuan held a subcommittee meeting on the morning of the 15th to review it and reached a resolution to pass it. The case was formally established, and the impeachment case was sent to the Executive Yuan and handed over for punishment, while the impeachment case was sent to the Committee for the Discipline of Public Officials for handling according to law. It is reported that the targets of the impeachment case are Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, Wang Aotang, the Finance Ministry's supervisor at the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and Shen Yunlong, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's supervisor at the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The target of the impeachment case is Xu Baiqi, Tao Qiming, and Xu Zhuanghuai. The reason for Wang Yunwu's impeachment is leaking secrets, while the officials stationed in Shanghai by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry are being impeached for ineffective supervision. The punishment methods are still to be decided by the Executive Yuan. According to authoritative sources, the impeached officials will not be subject to suspension from their positions. In addition, the impeachment case against Xu Baiqi and others is based on the grounds of using their power to speculate and profit. The punishment methods will be decided by the Committee for the Discipline of Public Officials. In this way, both the judicial and administrative parts of the case will come to an end.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 15th dispatch] The report by Control Commissioners Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin on the case of leaking secrets and selling Yongsha yarn is expected to be released on the 17th, and the impeachment cases will also be sent out separately. It is also learned that Tang and others are still investigating the entire circumstances of the case, and if there are new clues, they will conduct further investigations. It is rumored that the so-called hidden scholar is not Xu Baiqi or Tao Qiming, but someone else, but in fact, there are no new clues at present. In addition, regarding the previous rumor that the Commercial Press changed book prices on the eve of the currency reform, Tang and Sun have investigated the situation and learned that the Shanghai Book and Newspaper Association held a meeting on August 16 and decided to increase prices before the 18th. The Commercial Press's price increase was in compliance with this decision and was not related to the secret leakage case, so the previous rumor has been proven to be inaccurate.

### Overseas Remittances Surge After Currency Reform: Black Market Price of Guangzhou-Hong Kong Currency Falls to 72

[Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 15th dispatch] According to a senior official of the Bank of China in Guangzhou, since the currency reform, the amount of overseas remittances received by the bank has suddenly increased due to financial stability and the upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival, and it is expected to increase by more than double compared to last month. In the past two days, various banks and bureaus have been enthusiastically redeeming gold, silver, and foreign currency, and the black market price of Hong Kong dollars is even lower than the official price. In the past, due to the trade relationship between Guangdong and Hong Kong, unscrupulous merchants still maintained the so-called Hong Kong dollar black market after the issuance of the new currency, lowering the value of the gold yuan. However, in the past two days, it has risen to 72, that is, 72 gold yuan can be exchanged for 100 Hong Kong dollars. This phenomenon has not occurred since the victory, which shows that the prospects for the new currency will be more optimistic.

### Only See Meetings, No Action: Changsha's Special Price Rises Endlessly

Control Work is Extremely Lax

[Report from our Changsha office, 15th] The prices of daily necessities continue to rise endlessly, with prices changing every three days. The Municipal Economic Management Committee only holds meetings, taking no action. Wang Boyong, the Director-General of the committee, even stated publicly that the price limits set on August 19th were too far from market prices and advocated for a wider range. After the police team investigated and banned the black market, merchants felt dissatisfied. Mayor Jiang also instructed that future task executions should be handled with consideration for objective circumstances. Today is the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, and vegetable prices are particularly bad, rising by more than double. However, piece goods and foreign yarn prices have fallen, some even below the set price limit, due to the weakness of the Shanghai market and the influx of goods.

The facts were confirmed, and they were sentenced according to the law.

### Taiwan Power Company Receives U.S. Aid; Electrification of Taiwan's Prospect is Promising; Decides to Repair Transmission Line Voltage Regulators

[Report from our Taipei office, 15th] The five new power projects announced by Stuart Layman in Washington include industrial accessories worth 1.15 million U.S. dollars for the Taiwan Power Company, far exceeding the company's original application. All sectors of Taiwan province are excited and feel that the electrification of Taiwan will create a beautiful future. According to the Taiwan Power Company authorities: for the past three years, restoration work has been carried out under the principle of self-reliance without obtaining a single foreign exchange. Therefore, the biggest difficulty is that although there is sufficient power generation, the lack of transmission equipment prevents the power from being fully transmitted and adequately distributed. During the Japanese occupation, the main transmission line voltage regulators were originally 154,000 volts, but now they are only 140,000 volts, requiring an additional 14,000 volts. Because there are no new devices to replace them, they are often damaged by weather, climate, and typhoons. Therefore, after receiving accessory assistance, it was decided to first restore the main transmission line voltage to the Japanese occupation records and reorganize and improve it so that it would not be affected by typhoons. It is estimated that this project will fit the U.S. aid amount. Regarding expansion issues, the company has separately applied for 3 million U.S. dollars under the construction item, which may be obtained. Then the previously planned Tianleng and Wulai power generation projects can be completed. Currently, the Wulai Power Plant has independently installed a generator that can generate 12,000 kilowatts. If construction aid is obtained, it is planned to install a large-scale generator at Tianleng, generating 26,000 kilowatts, and add another one at Wulai, generating 12,000 kilowatts. The two locations will generate a total of 50,000 kilowatts, which can make up for the current shortage of 50,000 kilowatts for industrial electricity. Currently, the scale of Taiwan Power Company is second only to Shanghai, ranking second in the country, and the amount of industrial electricity consumption is even higher, making Taiwan an industrial society. The ideal doesn't seem too far away.

### Taiwan Province and Japan Establish Barter Agreement

In the evening, crowds gathered in front of the newspaper's door, and the order became increasingly chaotic.

### The Italian Colonial Issue; Transferred to the UN General Assembly for Handling; The Four Powers Met for Three Days Without Agreement; The Soviet Union Proposed a New Proposal That Was Not Adopted

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 15th] The representatives of the four countries passed a letter to UN Secretary-General Lie today at their last meeting. The purpose of the letter is to notify Lie that the Four Powers Conference has decided to transfer the issue of former Italian colonies to the UN General Assembly for handling. The document was written in French and signed by the heads of the Four Power delegations. At the same time, the Four Powers Conference also decided to send the investigation committee's report and the recommendations of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference to the United Nations.

[Associated Press, Paris, 15th] The issue of the disposition of Italy's pre-war African colonies, namely Libya, Somaliland, and Eritrea, was transferred to the United Nations for handling on the 15th. Because the representatives of the Four Powers had not reached a consensus by noon on the 15th (Paris time), the issue automatically became a UN General Assembly issue. During the Four Power discussions, Soviet representative Vyshinsky suddenly proposed a new proposal, advocating that the territories be placed under UN trusteeship. Previously, the Soviet Union strongly advocated returning the colonies to Italy. In 1946, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes advocated UN trusteeship of the territories. This time, the Soviet Union completely copied and proposed it. (According to Byrnes' proposal, an advisory committee of the United Nations would be set up, including representatives of the Four Powers and representatives of local residents, so the Soviet Union would have a say in Italian-owned Africa.) The change in Soviet policy shocked the representatives of Western countries. Britain said it opposed the plan from beginning to end, while the United States made no comment. The Soviet proposal died in procedural debates, and as a result, the time limit arrived, and the Four Powers still disagreed. The Italian peace treaty stipulated that the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference would have one year to decide on the issue before it was transferred to the United Nations, but the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference had not reached an agreement after several talks.

[Associated Press, Paris, 14th] Today's meeting was completely wasted in fruitless debate. Soviet representative Vyshinsky condemned the United States, Britain, and France for trying to divide up Mussolini's former empire and accused the United States of building an air force base at Manraha in Tripoli, a strategic location, which was a violation of the treaty with Italy.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] A U.S. State Department spokesperson today reiterated the U.S. government's position on the issue of the former Italian colonies as follows: Somaliland should be placed under UN trusteeship and governed by Italy. Cyrenaica should be placed under UN trusteeship and governed by the United Kingdom. The issue of who Tripoli should belong to should be delayed for one year for discussion. The southern part of Eritrea should be immediately ceded to Abyssinia, and who the northern part should belong to should be decided within one year.

### Four-Power Negotiations on the Berlin Issue May Be Held in Paris; Three Envoys to Visit the Kremlin Again This Weekend

[Our report] London, 15th, broadcast: Responsible sources claim that the Berlin issue talks, after being held in Moscow this weekend, will be moved to Paris for continuation. The British, American, and French envoys met yesterday with Molotov, not Stalin. This meeting is extremely important. If there is success, it will be handed over to the Four Foreign Ministers for discussion in Paris. Otherwise, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will submit the issue to the United Nations for handling.

[Our report] Moscow, 15th, broadcast: Rumors that yesterday's talks between the British, American, and French ambassadors and the Soviet authorities were the last are absolutely untrue. The Four Powers' talks on the Berlin situation will continue, and these talks will be held again this weekend.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 14th] The three Western special envoys held their ninth meeting with Molotov on the 14th to discuss the Berlin crisis. The meeting lasted only ninety minutes, the shortest of all the meetings. According to authoritative sources in Washington and London before the meeting, the three Western envoys will ask the Soviet Union for a "yes" or "no" answer on lifting the Berlin blockade and will refuse to discuss other issues until the Berlin blockade is lifted. Smith said after the meeting, "Molotov, Siminov; no comment." Smith's words referred to Molotov and Siminov's participation in the meeting. The three envoys then went to the British Embassy to review the reports submitted to their respective governments.

### Berlin Situation Worsens; Marshall Expresses Pessimism

Marshall did not answer, but said that he had not had time to rest in the past week.

### Republicans Advocate That West Germany Be Transferred to the Jurisdiction of the State Department

[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] Congressional foreign policy observers believe that if Dewey is elected president in November, control of West Germany will quickly be transferred from the Department of the Army to the Department of State. Dulles, Dewey's foreign policy advisor, and Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, have both formally expressed their support for this move. If the Republican Party comes to power, one of these two may become Secretary of State. During the recent tension in Berlin, the idea of ​​transferring jurisdiction has only increased, not decreased. Furthermore, it is learned that some Republicans believe that "the military leaders in Berlin are advocating for a tough stance, while the American diplomats are negotiating with the Soviets in a coordinated manner," which is unwise. The transfer of control does not necessarily lead to the departure of Lieutenant General Clay, the military governor of Germany. Dulles and Vandenberg have praised Clay's performance, but once the system is changed, Clay's authority will be greatly reduced.

### Soviets Search for Anti-Communist Elements on the Border of the Occupation Zone

German Youth Arrested Sentenced to Heavy Sentences

[Associated Press, Berlin, 14th] According to German sources: the Soviets will start a large-scale search along the borders of the Berlin occupation zones on the night of the 14th. The German police in the British occupation zone of Berlin have strengthened their guard. There is no definite indication as to the reason for the alleged large-scale search operation. As in the past, it is intended to target "black market traders." Some people hinted that the purpose may be to capture Germans who are known to have anti-Soviet or anti-communist tendencies. Before this news occurred, U.S. Commander Clay declared that the U.S. military, regardless of the Soviet Union's "expel Germany" stance, will continue to stay until the last spark of Nazism is extinguished.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 14th] The Soviet military court sentenced five German youths who participated in the anti-Soviet demonstration at the Victory Gate on September 9 to twenty-five years of hard labor. This sentence has aroused strong resentment among the citizens of Berlin.

The city is approximately 100 miles from the capital of Hyderabad. According to today's Indian public statement: The Indian army's rapid advance on the road from Gulab to Hyderabad has caused a large number of Hyderabad troops and Muslim volunteer Razakars to surrender. Two columns of Indian troops have occupied Daratab and Charna in the Aurangabad region. The column advancing north from Solapur has occupied Osmairabad. Indian troops north of Yarmaira have entered the Falbani and Anjira districts north of Hyderabad.

The Indian Army Public Gazette also stated: The only fierce battle was at Hosph, the sixth attack point, where the Razakars extremists of the Hyderabad vassal prince counterattacked several times on the night of the 14th. Hosph is a railway intersection located in the Indian-controlled area of ​​Hyderabad, located at the extreme south of Hyderabad. The 1st Armored Division is the main force leading the way, and it has encountered almost no resistance. When the army in Khulab arrives at Sikondurabad, the real battle will occur, because the prince's elite troops are concentrated there, vowing to fight to the last person.

[Associated Press, New Delhi, 15th] India completely entered a state of war on the 15th. After the National Security Order was issued, the government has the right to summon and mobilize national resources to supply the attack on Hyderabad. The new order reinstates the Indian National Defense Regulations that were canceled after the war. It is believed that this severe measure is aimed at dealing with any emergency, including the Indian army's attack on Hyderabad. The Indian government claims that Hyderabad has been completely cut off from all telecommunications and communications with the outside world since the 13th.

Well-informed sources claim that President Truman may propose to all member states of the United Nations, including the Soviet Union, to negotiate a collective defense treaty, which is equivalent to an "expanded Atlantic Treaty." American observers emphasized that Marshall and Vandenberg advocated establishing such a treaty at the Brazilian capital conference, so as to unite the democratic countries of the world and enhance their strength to resist the spread of communism to the world.

### Responding to International Tensions: Britain Announces Military Buildup, Delays Demobilization, and Recruits Naval and Air Reserves

[United Press, London, 14th] British Deputy Prime Minister Morrison declared in the House of Commons on the 14th that, in view of the serious international situation, Britain has taken four drastic measures to maintain its defense capabilities: (1) delaying demobilization by three months; (2) stepping up work in aircraft factories to double production and refit older aircraft; (3) launching a recruitment campaign to strengthen naval and air force reserves; (4) replenishing munitions and increasing manpower to ensure adequate supplies for the armed forces.

Morrison explained that the reason for delaying demobilization by three months was that the loss of trained soldiers could not be replenished. This situation would be reviewed from time to time based on the latest developments. As a result of these four measures, the strength of the British armed forces would increase by 80,000 more than the original demobilization plan. These additional soldiers are all well-trained, which is what is most needed at present. However, the government deeply regrets taking these measures. As Morrison was speaking, military service orders were being received in Britain and overseas, extending the term of service from one year to fifteen months. Morrison continued that, unfortunately, the current world situation makes some changes to plans unavoidable. The government has no choice but to take certain precautionary measures. According to official statistics, the total number of personnel in the three British armed services at the end of July was 816,000, with approximately 50,000 personnel being discharged each month. Morrison's speech was delivered after the Conservative Party criticized the government for neglecting the international situation.

### Appendix (II) for the Seventh and Eighth Quarters: Approved Import Quotas of $42,141,000 Approved and Announced Yesterday by the Executive Yuan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] Since the promulgation of the Emergency Financial Measures Order, in accordance with Article 9 of the Measures for Consolidating Finances and Strengthening Economic Controls, import quotas from the seventh quarter onward should be reduced by at least one-quarter compared to the average level of the fifth and sixth quarters. It is learned that the Import Control Committee has already drafted the import quotas for Appendix (II) commodities for the seventh and eighth quarters, totaling $42,141,000, a decrease of more than one-quarter compared to the fifth and sixth quarters, amounting to $31,331,000. This proposal was discussed at the fourth meeting of the Executive Yuan's Economic Management Committee on the 14th. Among them, passenger cars, jeeps, motor trucks, and long-distance buses, which were originally only subject to quotas without foreign exchange allocation, will be re-evaluated after the situation is clarified. The remaining items were approved as proposed. The Executive Yuan meeting on the morning of the 15th reported the matter, and it was announced for implementation. According to the quotas set this time, items with U.S. aid supply have either not been included in the quotas or only listed with small quotas for supplementation, reducing them by $24,835,000 compared to the fifth and sixth quarters. The remaining items with reduced quotas include tobacco leaves and stems, paper and wood pulp, timber, and wax, totaling a reduction of $690,000. The quota for pharmaceuticals was increased by $400,000 to meet domestic medical needs. Therefore, although more than $30 million has been reduced for the seventh and eighth quarters, the influx of U.S. aid materials means that there should be no actual difficulties. Furthermore, according to the Central Bank's Measures for Payment of Foreign Currency Deposits, all foreign currency deposits in the country can be used to apply for the import of industrial raw materials listed in Appendix (II), so they can complement the quotas set by the Import Control Committee. It is expected that the raw materials needed for industry will be adequately supplied in the future. The approved import quotas for Appendix (II) commodities for the seventh and eighth quarters are listed as follows:

(Unit: U.S. Dollars) (1) Gasoline, aviation gasoline $800,000; (2) Diesel $2,300,000; (3) Kerosene $600,000; (4) Tobacco leaves and stems $2,500,000; (5) Ramie $600,000; (6) Ramie bags $1,400,000; (7) Chemicals $7,000,000; (8) Chemical products $4,000,000; (9) Paper and wood pulp $8,000,000; (10) Timber $2,600,000; (11) Wool and waste wool, fluff, and mixed hair yarn $4,000,000; (12) Unspecified aniline dyes and other coal tar dyes, synthetic indigo, and sulfide raw materials $3,600,000; (13) Rubber and products $3,000,000; (14) Lubricating oil $120,000; (15) Lubricating grease $5,000; (16) Oil wax grease $600,000; (17) Unspecified tanning paste $216,000; (18) Pharmaceuticals $800,000; (19) Passenger cars and jeeps (determined separately, no foreign exchange); (20) Motor trucks and long-distance buses (determined separately, no foreign exchange); (21) Developed film 16,000,000 meters (no foreign exchange).

### Closing of the Municipal Council General Assembly: The Process Was Peaceful and Smooth; The Speaker Expresses Satisfaction and Encourages Citizens to Support National Policy and Overcome Difficulties Together

[Report from this Newspaper] The seventh general assembly of the Municipal Council held its fifth meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the venue on Tanggu Road. Speaker Pan presided, with 140 councilors in attendance and more than 20 bureau chiefs and directors from the municipal government present. Jiang Jingguo, the city's economic supervisor, also attended as a guest and delivered a speech. The meeting discussed various proposals related to society, municipal government administration, matters referred by the mayor, matters referred by the speaker, and temporary motions. After the meeting, a ten-minute break was taken before the closing ceremony, which concluded successfully at 7:30 PM.

Speaker Pan delivered a closing speech, stating in brief: "The reason why this seventh general assembly was able to proceed so peacefully and smoothly is, in my opinion, not due to the council itself, but to the entire society. Because before and during the assembly, Shanghai had entered a state of stability, which refers to the stabilization of prices. This is something to be gratified about.

This Municipal Council General Assembly was scheduled to be held in October. The reason it was held earlier was due to the urging of the municipal government, because in June and July, the city's finances had reached their greatest difficulty, almost to the point of having no money for road repairs or garbage disposal. Since the central government promulgated the new economic measures plan, the city government's new budget and the adjustments to the property tax and municipal construction tax all awaited deliberation and approval by this council. This was also the most important matter of this assembly. The case has been reviewed and discussed several times by the Finance Subcommittee and the Review Committee. The merging of the property tax and municipal construction tax was approved, and the tax rate is much lower than that of the pre-war old Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council, and has also been reduced compared to the municipal government's original adjustment rate. I ask myself that this decision was made with due consideration to both the burden on citizens and the expenses of the municipal government. In addition, this assembly also approved a simplified tax collection procedure, which has also saved the municipal government a lot of manpower and resources, allowing the municipal government to barely maintain its operations in the future.

The current stability of prices in Shanghai is entirely due to the effective leadership of Supervisor Jiang and the strong cooperation of the city's military and police agencies. At the same time, it is also due to the support of the government by the people of the entire city. The large amount of gold notes exchanged by the Central Bank is sufficient proof. Recently, Shanghai, under the sincere cooperation of officials and civilians, can indeed be proud of itself and is worthy of being a model for the entire country. When we hear slogans from various places shouting "Learn from Shanghai!" "Learn from Shanghai!", we can see how important Shanghai is. I hope that President Jiang will effectively lead the people and the government to cooperate closely. We support the new economic plan promulgated by President Jiang and move towards the destination. The Municipal Council is willing to encourage citizens to overcome difficulties together and implement the new economic plan in the same direction."

### The Mayor Points Out Two Major Tasks for the Council: Stabilizing Prices Will Be the Main Task in the Future

After the Speaker's speech, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating briefly: "I believe that the Municipal Council has two major tasks at present. One is to balance the income and expenditure of the municipal government, and the other is to assist the central government in stabilizing prices. In terms of balancing the budget, with the assistance of the council, the purpose of re-compiling the city's budget under mutual consideration has been achieved. I believe that this decision is reasonable and fair. Before the war, the city's annual budget was 46 million yuan, equivalent to 92 million gold yuan. The current city budget is only 50 million yuan, and the population has increased by 2 million. Citizens should understand that the council has indeed taken into account the citizens' ability to bear the burden. The main task in the future is to maintain the stability of prices. If prices fluctuate again, the city budget passed this time will be in vain. I hope that all sectors will cooperate to seek the permanent stability of society."

### Supervisor Jiang's Speech: A Transition from Chaos to Stability Requires Sacrifice; Everything Still Requires the Cooperation and Assistance of Councilors

Then, Supervisor Jiang delivered a speech as a guest, stating briefly: "I have been ordered by President Yu to come to Shanghai to supervise currency reform and stabilize prices. When I was ordered, I had two feelings: (1) I was extremely excited to have the opportunity to live and cooperate with the people of Shanghai. (2) I was apprehensive about shouldering this important task because of my youth and lack of knowledge. But in the past three weeks, I have gained the greatest lesson: as long as you are with the people, you will not fail, you will only succeed. The experience of the past three weeks has strengthened my confidence in being able to succeed. The current stability of prices in Shanghai is a manifestation of the sincere support of the government by the entire city, and it is also the credit of the council and the municipal authorities for leading the people. I am very grateful. The current situation is still the beginning of our work, and there will be many difficulties in the future. However, I firmly believe that as long as all sectors cooperate, sincerely and earnestly, all difficulties can be overcome! What I hope most now is that the people and merchants of this city will never adopt a wait-and-see attitude again. In the future, there will be clear standards for the implementation of government decrees. The goodness or evil of merchants can be measured by this standard. Legal ones will be protected, and illegal ones will be severely punished, without any selfish prejudices. Recalling my service in Jiangxi, the first corrupt official to be shot was an old subordinate who had worked with me for four or five years. It is not that I have no personal feelings, but for the sake of the country and the people, I have to do this! The future work lies in the development of industry and commerce, because passively suppressing prices cannot last. Supporting industry and commerce is the only way to achieve stability. However, the transition from chaos to stability requires sacrifice. A temporary recession is unavoidable during the transition period. This can be compared to a fire. Although my house was not affected when the fire broke out, why was it demolished? It was to protect the houses of dozens or hundreds of families. So we have to look far ahead. If there is only today and no future, the sacrifice will naturally be in vain. This time, I have come to Shanghai to implement national policy and have always adhered to the unchanging concept, that is, to thoroughly implement the established policies, to seek their rationality, legality, and sentimentality, and at the same time to actively strive to stabilize prices and assist the development of industry and commerce. Everything still requires the cooperation and assistance of you councilors to overcome the difficult situation together and achieve the goal."

Finally, Deputy Speaker Xu delivered a reply on behalf of all councilors, hoping that Supervisor Jiang would assist the legitimate industrial and commercial sectors if they encounter difficulties in raw materials or production costs in the future, in order to jointly seek the stability of society. The meeting closed successfully at 7:30 PM.

The measure is that each passenger must register for cabin space at the Passenger Transport Section of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company before purchasing a ticket, and the section will issue a registration permit. The passenger can then take this registration permit to the location designated by the Garrison Headquarters to go through the review process. Once approved, the passenger can purchase a ticket from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and board the ship.

### Zhang Renyou and Others Suddenly Sent to the Special Criminal Court This Morning

[Report from this Newspaper] The case of Zhang Renyou, the chief of the Water Police Sub-Bureau of the Municipal Police Bureau, and others being accused of corruption, has taken a surprising turn since the Police Bureau transferred all case files to the District Prosecutor's Office on the 14th. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, prosecutors Cao Hong and He Huimin interrogated the defendants. They believed that the case was extremely complex and continued to conduct separate and isolated investigations, which lasted for eight hours until 11:30 PM. After investigation, Zhang and Shan Guohua, the chief of the Suzhou River Police Station of the Water Sub-Bureau, and patrol officer Wang Baoqian were found to have committed serious crimes such as deliberately allowing bandit ships to pass. Therefore, the District Prosecutor's Office transferred the three to the Special Criminal Court for trial. Huang Boqian, the chief of the Fourth Section of the Water Sub-Bureau, and Xia Zhemin, a member of the Second Section, were also heavily suspected. The District Prosecutor's Office detained them. Zhou Daiqing and Luo Zhaoqiang were allowed to be released on bail. The other eleven defendants were interrogated and released.

At 12:30 AM, Zhang and the other two were escorted by seven bailiffs from the District Prosecutor's Office in a vehicle to the Special Criminal Court overnight. All three were wearing police uniforms, hats, and shoulder boards. After arriving at the Special Criminal Court at 1:00 AM, they were temporarily detained in the waiting room. At 2:00 AM this morning, Zhang and the others each ate a bowl of noodles and then went to bed. Zhang slept alone on a cot, while Huang and Xia covered themselves with a military blanket and slept feet to feet. However, all three stared blankly at the ceiling, furrowing their brows in deep thought, filled with anxiety and unease.

### Various Circles Welcome Korean Special Envoy Group, Special Envoy Zhao Expresses Gratitude and Hopes for Continued Assistance from Our Country

[Our Newspaper Report] The Korean special envoy group, after visiting President Chiang in Beijing to pay their respects, returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 14th) and is scheduled to depart for Manila this afternoon. Various circles in the city held a welcome meeting at the New Life Clubhouse on Weihaiwei Road yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, with the participation of Korean Special Envoy Zhao Bingyu, Deputy Envoy Zheng, and Advisor Jin, along with Secretary Kim, totaling four individuals. Representing our side were Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Chen Guokang, Feng Youzhen, and over a hundred representatives from various circles. Mayor Wu, serving as the chairman, delivered a welcome speech, stating that China and Korea are two major peace-loving nations in the world. In the past, Korea, failing to recognize Japan's ambition, was exploited by invaders. Today, with Japan defeated and Korea's independence restored, China's government and public are deeply gratified. The lesson of Japan's invasion of Korea demonstrates that imperialism relying on military aggression is destined to fail, with Japan serving as a cautionary tale. On behalf of all citizens of Shanghai, I extend my best wishes for the health of the special envoy group, the prosperity of Korea, and the early realization of world peace. Speaker Pan followed with a speech, expressing hope that Special Envoy Zhao would elaborate on how China and Korea should cooperate and support each other in the future, in order to jointly strive for world peace. If China and Korea sincerely cooperate, it will greatly contribute to stabilizing East Asia. Chairman Fang Xikong, in his speech, expressed the hope that Korean expatriates in Shanghai would establish closer ties with the citizens of Shanghai to enhance friendship. After speeches by Wu, Pan, and Fang, Special Envoy Zhao stood up and delivered a sincere speech, expressing his warm gratitude for the welcome from all sectors. He stated that his visit to China was solely to represent the Korean President and people in expressing gratitude to the President and people of China, as your country's resolute recognition of the Korean government deserves our heartfelt thanks. The goodwill of your country towards Korea for the past two thousand years has created a deep emotional debt that we have long felt unable to repay. Over the past forty years, Korea's

independence movement has been deeply influenced by Mr. Sun Yat-sen of your country. During Japan's rule over Korea, many Koreans fled to your country and received favorable treatment and assistance. Your government and Kuomintang members provided much protection to Korean revolutionaries. In the United Nations General Assembly, your representatives consistently and fully supported Korea's independence, with President Chiang being the first to declare support for Korea's independence. The realization of Korea's independence is entirely dependent on your country's support. However, looking to Korea's future, crises loom on all sides. The Korean people are not only satisfied with organizing a government today but also wish to further achieve true unification. Today,

the expansion of international communism poses many difficulties to the establishment of the Republic of Korea. The emergence of the North Korean government was entirely created by Stalinist dictators. We must overthrow it. South Korea has twenty million people. In the general election on May 10 of this year, 93% expressed confidence in the government and are willing to unite with peace-loving people around the world to complete Korea's independent unification. To achieve this ideal, we sincerely hope that the people and government of your country will continue to assist us. The chairman just said that both China and Korea are peace-loving nations, which is entirely true. Between China and Korea, not only are customs and habits

similar in many respects, but the faces of the people also resemble each other. Considering the current situation of China and Korea, we already face a common problem. Your President once said that if Korea cannot be independent, China will be threatened. Therefore, he sincerely hopes that the two great nations of China and Korea can

strive together and advance side by side in the future. Our delegation is grateful for the lion brocade banners presented by all sectors of Shanghai during this visit to China. Special Envoy Zhao's speech was translated section by section by Mr. Chen Guolian. The hall resounded with applause after the speech. Finally, Chairman Fang led everyone in chanting slogans such as "Long Live the Republic of China" and "Long Live the Republic of Korea." The grand meeting ended joyfully at 4:15 PM.

### Doctors Colluding with Scalpers to Obtain Prescriptions and Acquire Valuable Medicines, Health Bureau Consults to疏導the Source

[Our Newspaper Report] The shortage of Western medicines has remained quite serious in recent days, especially with penicillin and other drugs being even more difficult to obtain. In addition to merchants hoarding and refusing to sell, it has also been reported that some doctors are colluding with scalpers, deliberately writing out large prescriptions for scalpers to acquire valuable Western medicines from various pharmacies. In view of this, the Health Bureau convened relevant units such as the Western medicine industry in its conference room yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to discuss how to 疏導important medicines and other issues.

### Case of Off-Exchange Sales of Yong Spinning Shares, Lin Legeng and Others Undergo Preliminary Hearing Yesterday, Du Weiping Claims He Never Inquired About Matters Within the Company

[Our Newspaper Report] Stockbrokers Lin Legeng, Du Weiping, Tao Liguolan, Xu Yang Shuyao, etc., were previously prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office for violating the Exchange Law. The District Court held a collegiate panel yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the second court, with Presiding Judge Shen Tianbao and Judges Mei Erhe and Fang Xianghai, to conduct the preliminary hearing. Defendant Du Weiping stated two points in court: First, the Hongxing Securities Firm and Huamei Industrial Trading Company he established separately hired Qiu Yunfeng and Sun Shuren to manage internal and external affairs. He trusted them to handle all matters, large and small. He personally rarely visited the firm to inquire about business, only receiving reports from the two on the firm's profits and losses. Furthermore, from August 11th to 20th, he had sores on his legs and was bedridden at home, with medical proof, and did not even visit the firm once. He was not familiar with the situation in the industry and had even instructed Qiu not to engage in off-exchange transactions. He had never discussed matters with Lin Legeng, Li Guolan, Yang Shuyao, etc. Second, the indictment from the District Prosecutor's Office stated that he had continuously engaged in off-exchange transactions and sold large quantities of shares since August 16th. He had already fully confessed to this during questioning by the Municipal Police Bureau. This statement is completely inaccurate. On the 2nd of this month, when he was summoned by the Municipal Police Bureau, he asked Qiu Yunfeng to accompany him to the bureau for questioning, as he was not familiar with the firm's business operations. He stated at the bureau, "I don't know anything about the situation in the firm, please ask Mr. Qiu." The police record of the interrogation did not differentiate between his testimony and Qiu's testimony, attributing all statements to "Du's answer." The record was not reviewed by him after the questioning, and he later learned that there had been significant alterations to the original statements. Therefore, it cannot be considered his testimony. Du concluded by stating, "Please conduct a thorough investigation of this case. If I have violated the law, I should be punished. Otherwise, please handle it impartially in accordance with the spirit of judicial independence."

Du and Lin Calm, Li Fat, Yang Thin

During yesterday's court session, approximately 500 family members and friends of the defendants were in attendance. The courtroom, which could accommodate over a hundred people, was filled to capacity. The remaining attendees were lined up along the staircases, and those who arrived later watched from the open space in the courtyard. The District Court dispatched multiple bailiffs to maintain order. The defendants were transported from the Masnan Road District Court Detention Center at noon and temporarily rested in the waiting room of the second court before the trial began. Du and Lin were both wearing grey mesh shirts. Du's leg injury had not fully healed, and he moved with slight difficulty, but his expression remained calm as usual. Tao Liguolan, healthy and plump, wore a silk cheongsam with a white base and small red flowers, looking around the court as if nothing was amiss. Xu Yang Shuyao, frail and seemingly unable to withstand the wind, wore a black cheongsam and a light yellow sweater, her brow furrowed in thought, appearing very worried. At 2:00 PM, the trial commenced, and the defendants faced the court in order. Chinese and foreign photographers took numerous pictures. China Electric also sent personnel to film the newsreel, but the District Court, citing a lack of precedent, halted the filming midway.

Rumors of Currency Reform Persist

After inquiring about the age, origin, and address of each defendant, the prosecutor Ding Tongjun stood up and read aloud the indictment. Presiding Judge Shen then began the interrogation. Du first stated: The Hongxing Securities Firm has been established for over a year, initially as a partnership, and is now solely owned. The Huamei Industrial Trading Company has been established for over two years. Both companies have separate managers, and he personally does not manage the actual business operations. To his knowledge, Hongxing has never engaged in off-exchange transactions, only acting as an agent for buying and selling. The rest of his statement was as described above. After the statement, the court allowed him to rest in a seat next to the stand due to his illness. When Lin Legeng was asked to testify, he stated: He is currently a broker-manager at number 190. On August 16th, he purchased 16 million shares of Yong Spinning from Hongxing, but the transaction was later cancelled due to insufficient funds. This point was not asked during the police interrogation, so it was not recorded. He had never shorted shares before, nor engaged in off-exchange transactions. He did not know Li Guolan or Yang Shuyao, and was not aware of any news regarding currency reform. When the court questioned Tao Li Guolan, she stated: She has been married to Tao Qiming for seven years. Two months ago, her family moved from Taiwan to Shanghai. Her husband went to Beijing to work in the Ministry of Finance and frequently returns to Shanghai. Since moving from Taiwan to Shanghai, she has not engaged in stock trading. Her husband returned to Shanghai on August 18th to visit his sick mother and then immediately went to Beijing, without informing her of any news regarding currency reform. Because her brother Li Boqin mentioned stock trading, she invited Xu Yang Shuyao to go to Huamei at 9:25 AM on August 19th. Due to the market downturn, the three of them each sold 2 million shares, earning approximately 2 billion yuan, which they repurchased at the closing bell. At this point, the court asked her why she went to Huamei, since Huamei is not a securities firm.

### Lu Lianjing and Two Others Indicted, Lin Legeng Also Implicated in Another Case

[Our Newspaper Report] Lu Lianjing, a native of Liyang and broker at number 190 in room 412 of the Securities Building on Jiujiang Road, has long been engaged in off-exchange transactions, which drew the attention of the Security Command's inspectors. On July 5th (Monday) of this year, when personnel from the Security Command monitoring the stock market inspected room 412, Zhou Chuanlin (i.e., Zhou Shoulun), claiming to be from Guangxin Bank, inquired about the off-exchange price of Yong Spinning shares and stated that a client needed to sell 1 million shares of Yong Spinning stock. The inspector replied that he was willing to buy them at 6,500 yuan (the daily price limit for the spinning factory was only 6,300 yuan). Zhou indicated that he was willing to sell at that price. At that time, the manager of the firm, Lin Legeng, also called, and the inspector pretended to be an employee of the firm and asked if the aforementioned transaction should be accepted. Lin replied that it could be accepted and that the off-exchange interest rate was 374 to 380 yuan. The Security Command, believing that Lu and others were indeed engaged in off-exchange transactions, reported it to the Shanghai Securities Exchange Supervisor's Office of the Ministry of Finance, which forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, ordering the revocation of their business license, copying the certificate documents, and transferring the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Furthermore, Lin Legeng testified in court, "When Du Weiping asked his manager Qiu Yunfeng to come to room 412, I sold 16 million shares of Yong Spinning, which were also entrusted to our firm for sale." This, along with the testimonies of Lu, Zhou, and others, confirmed the fact of the off-exchange transactions by the defendants. The investigation of the case has concluded. Except for the portion involving Lin Legeng, which has been prosecuted separately, Lu, Zhou, and Qiu have been indicted for violating the Exchange Law.

Mei to Huamei to sell. Li stated that she and Yang Shuyao had dealings with Huamei and had opened an account there, so they went to Huamei and asked Hongxing to sell the shares. She had no intention of doing so that day, but unexpectedly this caused trouble. The court inquired that according to the investigation, at 7:00 AM on the 19th, two women were waiting at Huamei until it opened, and then they immediately entered to sell shares, "are those the two of you?" Li laughed and replied, "There is no such fool in the world."

Xu Yang Shuyao Commits Crime Confusedly

Finally, Xu Yang Shuyao testified: She has been married to Xu Zhuanghuai for five years and had not engaged in stock trading before. At 9:30 AM on August 19th, she went to Huamei with Li Guolan. The door was already open, so she first sold 1 million shares, and then sold another 1 million shares due to the market downturn. She did not know Lin Du, etc., before. Her husband came to Shanghai once on August 14th and did not inform her of any news regarding currency reform. She stated: "I don't understand stock trading. Li Guolan invited me, so I went with her and confusedly committed a crime without knowing what was happening." The court then summoned witnesses Qiu Yunfeng and Hu Zengda (the former being the manager of Hongxing Securities Firm, and the latter being an employee of the firm). Neither of them appeared in court. The defense lawyers for the defendants then successively argued their cases. The court, noting that the witnesses had not appeared, ordered a postponement and instructed the defendants' lawyers to have the witnesses Qiu Yunfeng, Hu Zengda, and Sun Shuren summoned for questioning at the next hearing. The requests for bail by Lin Legeng, Tao Li Guolan, and Xu Yang Shuyao were denied.

(Another Report) The case will be reopened for a second hearing in a few days.

### Officials and Merchants Detained and Interrogated for Colluding in Foreign Exchange Racketeering and Smuggling Contraband

[Our Newspaper Report] The city's inspection authorities recently uncovered a major case of collusion between officials and merchants in private foreign exchange racketeering and smuggling of goods prohibited by the government. As the case is still developing, the investigating agency has declined to release details. However, according to information obtained by reporters from relevant sources, the organization appears to be an ordinary Western medicine shop on the surface, using the operation of Western medicine as a cover. In reality, they were using foreign exchange racketeering methods to smuggle prohibited imported goods for sale on the black market at high prices, thereby obtaining exorbitant profits. After receiving the aforementioned tip, the inspection authorities secretly investigated and, upon obtaining incriminating evidence, took action and discovered evidence of collusion with officials from a certain agency in the documents seized from the Western medicine shop. After consulting the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisor's Office, the inspection authorities detained the suspected officials and merchants, who are currently under interrogation.

Wholesale merchants who do not wholesale according to price limits greatly affect retail prices. Please instruct your city government to separately instruct them to wholesale as much as possible according to price limits, otherwise they will be treated as hoarding for profit." After receiving the city government's order, the Social Bureau immediately instructed the City Chamber of Commerce and the City Industrial Association to inform all manufacturers.

### Huaxin Shenzhuang's Foreign Exchange Racketeering Uncovered, Manager Xu Kejun Detained for Establishing Branches Overseas

Yesterday, the Economic Police Brigade of the Police Bureau, acting on a tip, uncovered a case of using business exports to illegally trade Hong Kong currency at the Huaxin Shenzhuang at number 14 Yongshou Lane, Yunnan Road, Ningbo Road. They seized confidential documents and account books related to foreign exchange racketeering to and from various locations, as well as seven gold ingots (weighing seven taels), seventy-two silver coins, seventy-one auxiliary coins, seventy-six US dollars, forty-one and a half Siamese baht, and one hundred and thirty Hong Kong dollars. The manager of the firm, Xu Kejun, was taken to the bureau for interrogation. Huaxin Shenzhuang specializes in exporting books, stationery, and cotton textiles, with a broad scope covering the South Seas Islands, Singapore, Siam, Penang, Hong Kong, and other places. It has branches and offices in the aforementioned locations, including Hong Kong Huatong Company, Singapore China Trading Company, Siam Nanyang Bookstore, Huaxin Zhuang Agency, Penang Mingming Bookstore, Huaxin Zhuang Agency, etc. Hong Kong Huatong Company is managed by Xu Bochao, the son of the firm's manager Xu Kejun. Operating funds from Singapore, Siam, Penang, and other places, as well as small remittances entrusted by overseas Chinese, are transferred by Huatong and secretly settled by Hong Kong Tao Heng and Guang'an Banks for black market exchange to the Shanghai firm, with monthly remittances to Shanghai via the black market amounting to approximately 20,000 gold yuan based on the gold yuan exchange rate. The police bureau uncovered this case based on clues from a secret telegram sent from Hong Kong to Shanghai by the firm.

### Typhoon Speed Slow, May Not See the Moon During Mid-Autumn Festival

[Our Newspaper Report] The center of the new Pacific typhoon reached 23.5 degrees north latitude and 124.5 degrees east longitude yesterday afternoon, in the ocean east of the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan. The speed is very slow, and the direction is northwest by north. Taipei had force 5 winds last night.

### Henan People Have Taken Up a Heavy Burden

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Ling Songshou

Since the early days of the War of Resistance, when the Yellow River breach at Huayuankou prevented the enemy from advancing westward, Henan people have had a saying: "Merit to the country, disaster to the locality." When talking about the suffering of the Henan people, these two sentences are always mentioned. Naturally, in the current situation of suppressing the rebellion, the Central Plains has been engulfed in boundless flames of war and has become a decisive main battlefield. The Henan people are, of course, once again bearing this sacred and heavy burden under the circumstances of "merit to the country, disaster to the locality"!

People who are concerned about the war situation in the Central Plains will certainly know how many points can be controlled within Henan Province today. However, apart from the Henan people, people will never know how much grain, labor, and apportionment the Henan people have to bear today in the government-controlled areas of dots and lines.

Taking Zhengzhou as an example, from November last year to June this year, the things taken from the people of Zhengzhou through the Zhengzhou County Government are as follows:

Procurement of military and public grain: 29,164,842 catties.

Procurement of firewood: 15,884,374 catties.

Procurement of bran: 4,455,665 catties.

Conscription of carts: 1,722 vehicles.

Purchase of green bricks: 9,310,000 pieces.

Purchase of lime: 5,641,000 catties.

Purchase of round logs: 71,231 pieces.

Purchase of planks: 2,133 square feet.

Borrowing of furniture: 5,110 pieces.

(The compensation for the above items totals 33,351,234,800 yuan).

The purchase price of more than 33.3 billion yuan listed above is still calculated according to the prices from more than two months ago. Now, it will inevitably have to be multiplied several times.

These grains or funds are, of course, apportioned to the people. For shops, ordinary shops have to pay several dan of grain each month, and more have to pay more than ten or dozens of dan. For farmland, the annual grain production per mu in Zhengzhou villages is about 150 to 200 catties. The entire year's harvest is completely paid off in one apportionment. Zhengzhou is now an isolated island. How much business can shops do in a month? Under this situation, shops are considered to have reached their end. In 1946, Zhengzhou had more than 2,000 shops, but now less than a quarter of them remain. As for the farmland, after a year of hard work, the result is still losing money. Who would be so foolish as to do this? Since it cannot be sold, it can only be left barren. People go elsewhere to find ways to make a living, so there is a lot of barren land in Zhengzhou now. However, these are not the core of the problem. Whether or not the people can afford to pay is secondary. The main thing is where to get almost 30 million catties of military and public grain in eight months? Let's not talk about how much of the area within Zhengzhou can be controlled, let's just say that it can all be controlled. The people of Zhengzhou will never admit that Zhengzhou's annual grain production will be even half of 30 million catties.

Grain requisition in Henan has long been a

terrifying term. In March of this year, the Henan Provincial Assembly's delegation to Beijing spent 52 days to appeal, and only in May did they get permission to exempt all previous unpaid grain. After the Battle of Kaifeng, it was rumored in Henan that the central government had approved that military grain would no longer be requisitioned in Henan, but this news does not seem to have been confirmed, because the requisition of military grain in Henan recently is still as urgent as fire.

### Difficult Situation for Qingdao Refugees, Engaging in Social Services

Continued Expansion of Accommodation for Child Refugees

[Our Qingdao Bureau, 13th] As a result of continuous planning by the Qingdao authorities, new measures have been taken for the refugees, children, and students who have fled to Qingdao: (1) Of the more than 2,000 refugee students, 800 will be selected to participate in public work relief projects, while the remaining thousand will be divided into teams to engage in social services such as refugee surveys, economic inspections, and voluntary guarding of public forests. These refugee students engaged in such services will be provided with food and clothing by the authorities, working half-time and studying half-time. (2) Among the more than 40,000 refugees, 25,000 of the elderly, weak, women, and children who cannot survive without assistance will be identified and issued food tickets. The remaining young and strong refugees will be given the opportunity to participate in cleaning the city and building the docks in exchange for wages. (3) The various refugee child accommodation institutions will be unified, and accommodation will continue to be expanded. Furthermore, Ms. Morel, a representative of the Joint Emergency Children's Aid organization stationed in Qingdao, arrived in Qingdao yesterday and began working at the former site of the Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Bureau on the 13th.

### Abuse of Adopted Daughter: Lawsuit Occurs in Guilin

[Our Guilin Bureau, 10th, Airmail] At this time last year, a case of a young lady killing a maid occurred in this area, spreading throughout the neighborhoods. The main culprit, Xu Peizhen, and her daughter were imprisoned, and the case remains unresolved to this day. On the 9th of this month, a similar case occurred, with the deceased being Zeng Zhenjuan, a 13-year-old adopted daughter, and the defendant being Shao Mingxiang, Xu Peizhen's unmarried mother-in-law (the owner of Sanhe Xing Store on Zhongshan Middle Road). The two cases occurred exactly one year apart and both originated from the "same family," which is considered an amusing anecdote here. Currently, Shao is accused of killing a maid, while the defendant claims that the deceased committed suicide by taking "Baishanya" poison. Upon examination, it was proven that there were two wounds on the deceased's forehead and minor damage to the brain. The case is currently under investigation and will soon be brought to light.

### Yao Yinglong Detained for Drug Trafficking; Communication and Visits Prohibited

[Our Chongqing Bureau, 15th] Yao Yinglong, the Major General Advisor of the Xichang Police Department, was detained by security authorities on August 9th for a case involving opium.

He was later instructed to resign due to public criticism. Now that he has been arrested in Chongqing, he requests fair handling of the matter.

The original review opinions from the review committee were approved. For the sake of convenient implementation, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has made some supplementary explanations and distributed them to power plants nationwide for compliance. The original review opinions and supplementary explanations are recorded below:

A. Original Review Opinions: (1) The prices of goods or services provided by public utilities should remain temporarily frozen at the prices of August 19th. The coal required by public utilities should continue to be supplied at the prices of August. (2) If the agreed price of a certain enterprise was determined long before August 19th and the cost has increased significantly, it is proposed to allow adjustments in accordance with Articles 3 and 15 of the Measures for Managing Finance and Strengthening Economic Control. The competent authorities should supervise the enterprises to improve management, increase efficiency, and save on waste. They should strictly verify costs, formulate adjustment price measures, and submit the proposed measures for approval, adopting a tiered pricing system to reduce the burden on ordinary people. (3) The financial management of various public utilities should be properly organized, and overdue payments should be actively collected to maintain self-sufficiency. If necessary, half a month's fee can be collected from users in advance at the August price. (4) The prices of various public utilities, transportation industries, and their required oil and coal are interconnected. It is proposed that the Yuan periodically convene relevant agencies for discussions to establish connections.

B. Supplementary Explanation: (1) Regarding the first point of the original review opinions, "The fuel required by public utilities should also continue to be supplied at the supply price of August," the ministry has telegraphed the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee. The Executive Yuan's meeting decided that the purchase and sale prices of coal used by public utilities and railways in September should be based on the purchase price of August 1st. The remaining coal allocation will be handled according to the price of August 16th. (2) According to the principle of the second point of the original review, the electricity prices of all power plants should be strictly verified for cost by the ministry, and the adjustment measures and prices should be formulated and submitted to the Yuan for approval before being implemented through a circular telegram. (3) The third point of the original review opinions, "If necessary, half a month's fee can be collected from users in advance at the August price," should be supplemented as follows: "The electricity bills for September (i.e., October fees) should be pre-collected at half the amount of the August electricity bills. The electricity bills for August (i.e., September fees) should still be collected according to the August (i.e., July electricity) fees."

### Sichuan-Yunnan-Xikang Governance Plan for the Yi People: Adopting the Principle of Ethnic Equality; Xikang Provincial Government Formulates Implementation Measures for Organizing and Training the Lolo People

[Our Kunming Bureau, 13th] The Sichuan-Yunnan-Xikang Border Affairs Committee has recently formulated a plan for governing the Yi people, the main contents of which are: (1) Adopting the principle of ethnic equality, with equality between Han and Yi, and jointly suppressing border bandits. (2) Adopting a policy of education and progress. (3) Focusing on politics and supplementing with military force. (4) Establishing Yi governance agencies in various regions. (5) Adopting separate laws and special curriculums to manage and educate border residents. (6) Combining management, education, health, and defense.

This plan has been adopted by the central government and will be gradually implemented in the spring. Furthermore, since the Bai Yi people in western Yunnan brewed independence, the authorities have decided to reform the Tusi system in the southwestern border areas.

### Coal and Gold Mines to Be Developed Within the Defense Line of Chengde

[Our Chengde Bureau, 13th] Although Rehe is currently suffering from anemia, it has countless mineral deposits. Over a thousand large and small deposits were exploited during the enemy puppet period. Gold and coal are produced within the Chengde defense line, and the quality is excellent. The daily output of gold mines reached 50 to 70 market taels during the enemy puppet period, but coal mines were not exploited. Recently, the military and political authorities, in order to solve the problem of winter fuel and develop financial resources, and to assist the border areas in suppressing the rebellion, have decided to use the method of providing work in exchange for food to start coal mining in the second half of the month. The gold mine requires a fund of 100,000 gold yuan. According to the land management department's planning, the possible daily output is 25 market taels. However, it is difficult to raise the fund, and the provincial government plans to apply for a loan from the central government.

### Changzhou Fundraising for Scholarships

Mingshan Middle School Returns Teachers' Training Fees

[Report from our Wujin office] After the opening of schools in this county, many poor children were barred from school because they could not afford the fees. Parents and children were tearful and resentful, and there were many who wept in misery. County Councilor Gu Qiao Ruo initiated fundraising for poor student scholarships, and published an article in the newspaper, believing that teachers' training fees were unjustly obtained. He resolutely returned the more than 4 billion yuan in training fees already collected by Mingshan Middle School, which he heads, to the parents of each student to show his leadership. In addition, Ms. Qin Ruiwen first donated 50 gold yuan and sent it to the Zhongshan Daily for collection, with a letter stating: "I am in great pain because I have not received a proper education.

### Autumn Wind

— He Ku

Although the midday sun still has a bit of its "rampant" residual heat, after all, the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and gradually, a bit of coolness is felt between morning and evening. In the evening, I lean against the south window to express my pride, and a half-moon shines perfectly on the couch by the window. The autumn wind blows gently, bringing a refreshing feeling. With the passing of the wind, a rustling sound comes from the nearby leaves. The leaves begin to wither, and often, in the blink of an eye, one feels a longing for their hometown. Zhang Han, the Grand Commandant under King Jiong of Qi, thought of reed shoots when the autumn wind blew and said very elegantly, "Life values contentment; how can one be tied down by officialdom thousands of miles away for the sake of fame and rank?"

What I think is missing in modern people compared to the ancients is this kind of generous spirit. Zhang Jiying could go home and enjoy his leisure when he found his job as a civil servant dull. Modern people are not like that. They know that the meat is not plump, just a bone, but they can only gnaw on it and not let go. If you become chic and want to "fulfill your ambitions" and return to your hometown, don't talk about lacking the beauty of a reed shoot, even the bone is gone. On the other hand, there are a hundred people eager to pursue the bone that has been abandoned, satisfied with a single gnaw. From this perspective, it is not the sorrow of modern people, the so-called daily squeeze of livelihood.

Speaking of livelihood, indeed, when the autumn wind rises, one feels the situation is serious. In order to maintain the necessary warmth of the body, thin clothes must be replaced, but today, it is really difficult to add new clothes. In a tailor shop on Beijing West Road, an ordinary suit costs 120 yuan. You and I may be able to spend a month's income to buy a suit, but often, one side is supported while the other collapses, and the food at home has to be put on hold. Some people say that Liang Dangxuan's "The whole family is in the west wind, and winter clothes have not been cut in October" is pretentious, trying to knock a bamboo stick. Considering the situation today, unless one makes do and wears old clothes, it is really beyond the ability of ordinary people to have the whole family tailor new clothes. But Shanghai's fashion stores are as numerous as bamboo shoots after the rain, and each one is booming with business and filled with ladies. If we simply magnify this part of the picture, Huang Zhongze's poems are simply shabby and not worth a glance.

That being said, as far as the scenery of nature is concerned, when the autumn wind rises, the scenery is truly extraordinary. At this time, the colors in nature, although not as good as the spring light in March, are just transitioning from brilliance to plainness, still carrying a bit of the afterglow of brilliance. I will never forget the sailboats and sandpipers on the Qiantang River at this time, the rippling water, and the clear, blue river flowing all the way to the distant mountains. The so-called "Fishermen's houses on the river dip in the water, idle clouds linger by the mossy rocks" in the Sword South Poetry Collection can outline a bit of the scenery of the Qiantang River at this time.

Therefore, when the autumn wind rises, it is indeed a suitable season for travel. Although life is inevitably subject to the torment of life, one should ultimately break free from the shackles of torment and appreciate the scenery of nature. This is at least much better than chasing fame and fortune, because the latter is only the satisfaction of ambition and the senses, while the former is what can obtain the "fulfillment of ambition" of the soul. Lu Fangweng said, "Despite poverty, still buy books." In fact, under the principle of "despite poverty," both buying books and traveling are worth trying.

### Remembering the Lü Bicheng Sisters (Part 1)

— Lu Danlin

Yesterday, I read Mr. Chen Yixian's "Remembering Ms. Lü Meisun," and I learned that he thought of Lü Meisun because of my "Remembering Ms. Lü Bicheng." Regarding Ms. Lü's father and the trivial matters of her sisters, I will supplement what I know below.

Ms. Lü's father, Lü Fengqi, styled Ruitian, was a native of Jingde. He was a successful candidate in the provincial examination in the gengwu year of the Tongzhi reign (1870) and a jinshi in the dingchou year of the Guangxu reign (1877). He was assigned to the Hanlin Academy as a compiler. In the renwu year (1882), he served as the Educational Commissioner of Shanxi. He authored the "Jingran Zhai Poetry Collection," which is described in Chen Ziyan's (poem) edited "Anhui Elegant Initial Collection." Then there is Lü Meisun's description: "After my late father passed the imperial examinations, he filled the post of tutor in the Jingshan Palace. In the jiaxu year (1874), he passed the examination to be a secretary of the Grand Secretariat. In the dingchou year of the Guangxu reign (1877), he paid homage to the emperor and was reassigned to the Hanlin Academy as a shujishi (probationary academician). He was soon appointed as a compiler, successively filling the posts of drafter in the academy, co-editor of the National History Institute, and compiler of the Imperial Genealogy Hall. In the renwu year (1882), he was appointed as the Educational Commissioner of Shanxi. After completing his term, he requested to retire due to illness and moved to Liuan, where he built the Chang'en Retreat, which housed tens of thousands of books. He passed away in the winter of the yiwu year (1895). My two older brothers were both from Jiang Shuren, who passed away earlier. She was the great-granddaughter of Jiang Xinyu, a historiographer from Qianshan, who was also skilled in poetry. My mother was the daughter of Yan Qintang, a licentiate from Lai'an, and the granddaughter of Shen Xiangpei, the wife of Prefect Wu Yinqi. She married my late father as his second wife and gave birth to four daughters. After my late father passed away, evil relatives contested for succession and seized the family property... From this, one can understand Ms. Lü's family background.

There were four Lü sisters: the eldest, Huiru; the second, Meiye (originally named Xianfen, styled Zhongsu, later changed to Meisun, and when living in Qingdao, used the pseudonym Qizhou Female Commoner); the third, Bicheng (styled Duntian, also known as Shengyin); and the fourth, Xianman, styled Kunxiu. Huiru was skilled in ci poetry and also in painting. In the postscript to "Huiru's Short and Long Sentences" attached to Xiaozhu Ci, Bicheng said, "My eldest sister Huiru was deeply knowledgeable in national studies, familiar with hundreds of schools of thought, and had the demeanor of a female scholar. She vowed to remain a widow and presided over maternal education. She spent many years at the Changjiang Ningguo Women's Normal School, and many admired her conduct. At the time of her death, there were family disputes, and her writings were lost. The search for her posthumous manuscripts was listed in the lawsuit, as they were seized along with the inheritance, which is unprecedented for talented women in ancient times..." Huiru's husband was Yan Xiangxian, a marriage between cousins. In Meiye's poem "Returning to the Capital Again," she said, "I, my sister, serve with a towel and comb, an older cousin and brother-in-law," referring to him. Huiru's death was after 1921, because in the winter of 1920, Huiru was still composing ci poetry. Bicheng went to the United States in 1920 and happened to return to China when Huiru died.

Meisun, in her "Visit to Yingzhou Record," described the origins of her journey to the East, saying, "I lost my father at a young age, and from a wealthy family, I changed into an orphaned and poor girl. After the age of twenty, I left my mother and went to Tianjin to serve as a teacher at the Beiyang Women's Public School and concurrently as the chief teacher at the Beiyang Higher Women's School. The following year, I left Yuguan and responded to the invitation of General Zhao Erxun of the Three Eastern Provinces to serve as the dean of studies at the Fengtian Women's Normal School and concurrently as a teacher at the Sino-Japanese co-operated Women's Art School, with the title of honorary principal. It was because General Zhao and my late father, the Educational Commissioner, were classmates in the dingchou year of the imperial examinations, and he cared for the poverty of the family's children and cultivated them generously. It was the late Guangxu era. At that time, one could apply for government funding to study in Europe and the West, but in the end, it was difficult to travel far due to the need to support my elderly mother. After the age of thirty, I again held teaching positions in women's schools in Fujian and Shanghai, and most recently, I was the principal of the Jiangsu Anhui Women's Normal School... Reflecting on my life's travels through eight or nine provinces, north and south to the extreme borders..." This is a chapter from her autobiography. Her published collections of poetry and prose include: "Mianli Yuan Poems" (Complete and Continued Collections), "Yangchun Baixue Ci," and "Yingzhou Visit Poetry Record," etc. Before the Anti-Japanese War, she lived in Qingdao. Her son, Xun De, worked at the Shanghai Bank in Qingdao. In recent years, communication has been cut off, and it is unknown whether she is still in Qingdao.

### A Record of Queuing to Buy Surplus Goods

— Mao Yuding

A few days ago, I saw in the newspaper that the Bureau of Materials Supply was selling a large amount of surplus materials in Wing On Department Store, and many citizens were buying them, especially canned food, which was snapped up. I also wanted to buy cheap goods. At eight o'clock that morning, I rushed to Wing On, and I saw dozens of people already waiting in line at the Hubei Road entrance.

Finally, I squeezed into the door of the building. I wanted to breathe a sigh of relief, but I immediately became nervous again: I had to find the cheap things in my mind. I paid attention to the prices of goods in each counter. Except for hardware and Western medicine, which I was not very familiar with, other things like canned food and stationery did not seem to be cheaper than elsewhere, but there were piles of people crowding and buying like crazy. I thought to myself, they are undoubtedly more familiar with the market than I am. I walked around the market twice without buying anything. I thought I couldn't come empty-handed, but I would still go away empty-handed, so I bought two cans of peaches, five jiao each. While I was paying, many men and women crowded around to buy peaches. At first, I didn't understand what this meant, but later I understood that they were a group of true followers. Seeing me buy peaches, they thought the peaches must be cheap.

I didn't linger for long, and I squeezed out with two cans of peaches. My ears were full of buzzing sounds. When I got out of the door, I felt my head was clear, like I had just walked out of a garden full of bees.

### Life and Wealth

— Chen Yanfan

Lately, I often think about a problem unintentionally, perhaps related to the things I see and hear around me. A young friend I often met suddenly passed away from a sudden illness. In addition to Mr. Tang, who drowned while swimming in the United States, I lost another friend. Recently, another relative, only in his twenties, had a lung disease and coughed up blood. I hadn't seen him for three days, but he was lying in bed, looking very serious. Apart from Mr. Tang, the friend who died of a sudden illness and the relative mentioned above were both young people who I knew led very unrestrained lives. The former often overate and frequented dance halls and cafes, while the latter was a wealthy young man who married early and indulged in poverty.

Many people feel pessimistic about the fragility and impermanence of life and develop misanthropic thoughts. On a superficial level, they enjoy life, are cynical, and are lazy and颓唐 when things happen. On a deeper level, they are pessimistic, avoid things, and even become mentally ill. Chinese people, both educated and uneducated, often say, "What's the point of living in this world? You never know when you're going to die, so eat and play while you're young and have money." There are lines in ancient poems that say, "Sing when you drink, how long is life?" and "Drink today if you have wine today." It can be seen that there is more than one person who holds the idea of eating, playing, and enjoying life.

Youth and wealth are the most precious things in the world. But young people and those with wealth in the world do not know how to cherish their youth and wealth. We can see in recent newspapers news about the market tigers who were engaged in speculative hoarding in Shanghai being detained. These people, who already possess a large amount of wealth, still desperately accumulate wealth by any means, violating laws and regulations. They are also mostly unwilling to donate anything for relief. This is how the rich in the world are: the more wealth they have, the less they know what to do with it. They would rather hoard it, endangering or imprisoning their descendants and themselves.

Wealth is precious because it has power and can be used to do things that benefit a large group of people. Youth is also precious because it has power and can be used to do things that benefit a large group of people. The world of those who enjoy life, are颓唐, selfish, and self-interested is becoming increasingly small, while those who contribute their lives to things that benefit a large group of people will obtain eternal happiness. It's a pity that young people often waste their youth, and people don't know the power of wealth, so youth and wealth lose their meaning.

### Occasional Poem

— Huang Yunmei

There is no land to settle down, the moon on Huazi Hill is alone. The world has changed several times in the East Sea, can waves be as easily moved as mountains? Pitifully, the horse is startled by official affairs, and I wait in vain for a loyal official! Don't laugh at my high song, I have long forgotten sleeping.

### Autumn Night

— Lu Yanshao

The urgent cry of geese passes, the full shadow of the toad descends. The sound of commerce shifts the ancient mansion, the colors of autumn fill the high forest. The city gates are alarmed by the cold, wind and frost head towards the evening anvil. Turning sideways on this day, I still see the depths of the Shu River.

### On Crickets

— Ji Yun

As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, those who raise crickets take out their stock and gamble against each other, gradually entering a state of excitement. This custom is common in both the north and south, and it is becoming more and more popular. The luxurious leisure class even buys the winning insects in the arena with heavy gold to strengthen their strength and goes out to face opponents everywhere. When they hear that a certain arena is the most popular and has the most gambling, they call friends and gather to conquer from afar, even if it costs a lot of money, they are not stingy. However, in order to seek certain victory, one must carefully select good insects. Therefore, the art of catching insects and selecting them is paramount, and I will describe them separately as follows:

(1) Catching Insects: Catching insects must be done at night. (During the day, one can also catch insects that call for females, but they are very few.) Listen for the sound of insects chirping, look for them and catch them. A good catcher can tell the size of the insect and whether it is good or bad as soon as they hear the chirping. On autumn nights, the chirping of insects can be heard everywhere. If one cannot distinguish the sound, but catches them as soon as one hears them, even if one works hard all night and catches countless insects, they will still be useless. Generally speaking, those that chirp for a long time, are small and constant, rarely have good insects, and the insects are very small, not worth catching. Those that chirp only a few times and then stop, and then chirp a few times after a while, are more likely to be good insects. Those with loud chirping sounds are often larger, or insects with white spots on their heads. Those with solid and clear sounds are mostly good insects. Those that sound like they have a metallic sound are mostly green insects, the strong players of late autumn. Those that make a "pi pi" sound are mostly broad-winged, or oily purple, oily yellow, or oily green insects, who are dominant in early autumn. Those whose chirping is followed by a "ling ling" sound have wings that are slightly different from ordinary insects, and can tremble to make this sound, like cicada wings. There are many good ones among them. At the beginning of the night, or when the sky is about to dawn, when all the insects chirp together, is the best opportunity for catchers. Otherwise, some chirp and some don't, especially after the rain, the chirping is most prevalent. If there is heavy rain followed by a hot sun, then the next few nights will be the best opportunity, because the insects are most productive after being moistened by the rain and baked by the sun. As for the method of catching insects, first you must listen to where the sound comes from in the hole, then gently light a fire and carefully look at it. The head of the insect is often at the entrance of the hole. When you see it, insert a bamboo or iron stick from the side, copy behind it horizontally, and gently pull it to drive the insect out. Do not use too much force, as the insect will jump in surprise and it will be difficult to find. Also, do not use fire to get close to the entrance of the hole, as it will startle the insect and make it escape back into the deep hole, making it impossible to get it out. It is especially taboo to insert a stick into the entrance of the hole, as you will either kill the insect or force it to escape into a horizontal hole, even if you pour water in, you cannot guarantee that it will come out. When the insect is driven out of the hole, if you see a good insect, do not panic, otherwise you will scare the insect away or injure it. You should gently cover it with a cover woven with horsehair or thin copper wire. Once the insect enters the cover, store it in a container and carry it back to raise it in a tile jar. This insect will then be mine.

(2) Selection: There are many insects in early autumn. If you buy and catch them at the same time, it is easy to get hundreds of them a day, but only a few are worth keeping. The selection depends entirely on eyesight. The insects that are caught for the first time are not normal in color and their bodies are mostly constricted. Only an experienced person can tell their merits and demerits. The best color is true green, followed by true yellow and true purple, then light green, light yellow, and light purple, and the worst is male and oily. Because the colder the weather, the fewer insects there are, the more gambling there is. The above-mentioned true-colored insects fight the best in cold weather, especially true green, so it is listed as the top choice. As for the shape of the insect, the first is that the head and teeth must be large, the second is that the neck must be wide, the body must be long, the meat must be fine and solid, and the legs must be long, but if all the shapes are good but the color is dark, it is still not worth keeping, so color discrimination is the most important, and only an experienced person can do it.

### The Immortal Emperor

— Lin

In our country, emperors were called "Heavenly Sons." The Japanese call their rulers "descendants of gods." All of these are visions of human rulers as celestial beings. Such feudal consciousness is not worth smiling at. This was also the case in Portugal. King Sebastian of Portugal was killed in Morocco in 1578, but the Portuguese all said that their king was actually a celestial being who descended to earth and was bound to be immortal. Therefore, no one believed that he was killed. It has been nine generations since then, but the Portuguese belief has not wavered. Every night, they look up at the sky, hoping to see their former ruler return. There are still many people who do so. People borrow money to sign bonds, stating that "the debt will be paid off after King Sebastian returns."

### Ministry of Food Clarifies "Collection of Grain Tax in Kind"

The Ministry of Food replied in a letter: Respectfully acknowledged your letter of August 7. Regarding the inquiries in the letter from Mr. He, a reporter from your newspaper, I will briefly reply as follows: (1) The collection of grain tax in kind is based on the "Wartime Regulations on the Collection of Grain Tax in Kind." The standards for grain tax collection, the collection procedure, the deadline for payment, and the late payment penalty are all specified in the regulations. Now that the suppression of the rebellion continues, it is still applicable. (2) In addition to collecting grain, grain tax in kind also carries a 30% levy for provincial and county public grain, and other surcharges are prohibited. (3) If the provincial and county grain tax management offices deliberately violate laws and regulations and impose surcharges without authorization, they can be reported in accordance with the law. The above three items are replied accordingly for your information and transmission to the Social News Department of the Shen Bao Editorial Department. Ministry of Food, September 1st
