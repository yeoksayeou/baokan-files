### Heavy Fighting Around Siping, Defenders Along Blood River Defend Fiercely, Liaonan Troops Clearing Out Areas Along the Taizi River, Intense Fighting Outside Luoyang, Western Henan

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 10th] In the fierce fighting around Siping, the bandits, under the cover of intense artillery fire, are constantly attacking the city. The defending troops are holding fast to their positions, preventing the bandits from approaching. The air force is constantly flying sorties to bomb and eliminate the threat posed by the bandits' artillery fire, as well as cut off their retreat. However, the northern and southeastern highlands of Siping have been occupied by the bandits. The National Army is bravely defending Siping amidst the bandits' fire net established from high ground, buying time. The newly appointed Chairman of Liaobei Province, Xu Liang, was ordered on the 10th to lead his cavalry from Tieling to Kaiyuan, hoping to establish a government in Liaobei as soon as possible.

The National Army advancing towards Liaoyang and Xinmin is also undertaking the work of clearing the surrounding areas.

### Unprecedented Disaster in Qingdao, Explosion of Military Ammunition Depot on Shanghe Road, Approximately 500 to 600 Civilian Deaths and Injuries

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 10th] Ding Zhipan, commander of the 11th Pacification Zone, and his deputy commander, Li Mi, express their sincere gratitude to Vice Admiral Badger for mobilizing all the U.S. Navy's medical personnel to rescue the disaster area of the Shanghe Road explosion, demonstrating righteousness, courage, and benevolence.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 9th] At 11:30 AM on the 9th, a military ammunition depot on Shanghe Road in this city suddenly exploded, the sound shaking heaven and earth and the whole city. Instantly, black smoke billowed into the sky, reaching a thousand feet high, followed by raging flames, and iron sheets and unprimed shells flew everywhere. The citizens of the city turned pale with fright, and order broke down for a time, enveloping the city in an atmosphere of terror. The disaster area reached one square kilometer, with unprecedentedly severe losses. Within a radius of 500 meters of the explosion center, including Shanghe Road, Guitai Road, Qingcheng Road, Dagan Railway Station, Taishan Road, and other locations, more than 2,000 residences were completely destroyed. Cement and copper-bone buildings had cracks in their rear walls due to the violent shaking, teetering and collapsing, and most of the roof tiles were blown away, and the windows and glass were shattered. Thousands of solid buildings have been turned into ruins and are catching fire and spreading. The Qingdao Port Authority's Dagan terminal office buildings and warehouses collapsed. Immediately after the incident, martial law was declared in the affected area. The U.S. Marine Corps was the first to mobilize to assist, with more than ten ambulances and 200 medical personnel arriving on the scene. The Shandong University-affiliated hospital dispatched an ambulance and more than a dozen nurses. More than twenty U.S. military and Qingdao fire trucks and a municipal hospital ambulance arrived to provide rescue, and a plane circled overhead to observe the situation. As of 7:00 PM, more than 100 corpses had been found, lying across the sidewalks of Shanghe Road, covered with quilts, a bloody and blurred sight, too horrible to look at. The total number of deaths and injuries is estimated to be 500 to 600. Rescue and firefighting work has not yet stopped, and the dead are still being excavated. There were also casualties among the U.S. Navy. Those with minor injuries were sent to the municipal hospital, and those with serious injuries were sent to Pier No. 2 for treatment on the U.S. Navy medical ship. There were dozens of people in total. The explosion site was originally stationed with two platoons of wounded soldiers from the 8th Army, a squad of guards, a company of transport troops, eight vehicles, as well as stored clothing and other supplies. The deaths, injuries, and losses are still under investigation. The Suiyuan Road Elementary School and refugee shelter nearby suffered heavy casualties. The city's hospitals were full, with wounded people covered in blood being carried, driven, and walking for treatment. It can be called an unprecedented disaster. After the incident, the reporter rushed to the scene to inspect. Along the way, residents facing this catastrophe were all standing on the streets, looking nervous and waiting for news. On the scene, all that was seen was smoke and flames, refugees were rushing to transport clothing and quilts, and broken bricks blocked the road, like the aftermath of a major bombing. Chinese military police were on hand to serve, extremely brave, and U.S. military police and Navy medical personnel were also actively engaged in the rescue. The authorities are conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of the accident.

### Government Protests to Soviet Union Over Unauthorized Intrusion into Airspace and Attack on Civilian Aircraft, Foreign Minister Wang Meets with Soviet Chargé d'Affaires and Sends Note

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Foreign Minister Wang met with Fedlin, Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy in China, at 11:00 AM on the 10th and sent a government note protesting the illegal act of two Soviet fighter planes with red star markings intruding into our Bohai territorial airspace without permission and attacking and strafing the Chennault Air Transport Group aircraft. It is reported that this protest did not include a request for compensation, because the Soviet planes' actions did not cause any harm. The Soviet Embassy in China only stated that it would forward the note to Moscow and did not express any other opinions.

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] Chennault stated that he believes that the two fighter planes with "Red Star" markings that shot at the Air Transport Group aircraft were Soviet planes based in Lushun. He also said that the Soviet Union has no reason to oppose my planes flying to and from Shenyang. We are flying on Chinese territory under the orders of the Chinese government, completely in accordance with international law. Chen also said: "I have ordered the Air Transport Group aircraft to continue flying to Shenyang to carry out the evacuation work. The number of people evacuated from Shenyang has reached 3,000, and this work will be completed soon."

### The Weekly War Situation Announced by the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released the "Weekly War Situation" from the 3rd to the 9th of this month on the 10th. The full text is as follows:

Siping City Under Combat

During this week, the bandit troops in the Northeast continued to move from western Liaoning to northern Liaoning. With the strength of two columns, they attacked the airport in Siping. On the 4th, it was once invaded by bandits, but was repelled by the National Army. The bandits then reinforced and counterattacked. At noon on the 6th, the National Army, because the airport had been destroyed by artillery fire, concentrated its forces to consolidate the suburban area of Siping. It is still under combat now.

The North China Battlefield Achieves Brilliant Results

Since the National Army launched a sweep in the North China battlefield, it has already achieved brilliant results. On the 4th, it defeated the four regiments of Liu Bingyan's bandit troops in the Jizhong Military Region who had infiltrated the Pingjin-Baoding triangle area. On the 5th, near Xianghe in eastern Hebei, it captured more than 70 bandits, including the district team leader and village cadres of the Third District, and seized a large number of weapons. It immediately recovered Baodi, Xianghe, and other places. On the 7th, it annihilated more than 600 bandits of the southern branch of the Tangshan outer perimeter and militiamen, and more than 300 bandits of the Fanjiadian who infiltrated near Qinhuangdao. At the moment, scattered bandits are quickly being cleared from both sides of the Guannei section of the Beining Railway, and the Pingjin Highway is also unblocked. Several columns of Nie Rongzhen's bandit troops are still hiding in the mountainous area of Yixian, Mancheng, Tangxian, Wanxian, and Dingxian on the west side of the Ping-Bao line.

Communist Bandits in Central China Scatter and Flee

The communist bandits in Central China have recently scattered and fled in separate groups. Chen Yi led four columns, 1, 6, 8, and 4, from western Shandong to the Taikang, Tongxu, and Qixian areas in eastern Henan. Because they were severely attacked by the National Army, they have returned to western Shandong in recent days. His two columns, 2 and 7, in Jiaodong have recently moved south to the border between Shandong and Jiangsu. Liu Bocheng led two columns from the Xixian and Gushi areas north of the Dabie Mountains and fled from south to northwest, wanting to cross the Huai River again to seek supplies. Chen Geng's bandit troops are moving northwest in western Henan, attempting to destroy the Longhai Railway again and threaten Luoyang. The National Army is currently pursuing all the bandits. It is expected that there will be fierce battles soon.

The Yichuan Campaign is Worthy of Song and Tears

In northern Shaanxi, Peng Dehuai led five columns of bandit troops to invade Yichuan, along with more than 80,000 militiamen who were coerced into joining. They formally encountered a National Army corps in the area of Shicun and Danyangzhen west of Guanchuan, launching a bloody battle. Both sides suffered losses. Senior generals of the National Army, such as Corps Commander Liu Kan and Division Commander Yan Ming, died heroically in battle, creating a heroic and moving historical event. This is the manifestation of the National Army's revolutionary spirit of sacrifice. This battle will have a more significant meaning for the future of bandit suppression than the heroic martyrdom of Division Commander Zhang Lingfu of Menglianggu last year. With this spirit, the National Army can eliminate the communist bandits.

### 500 Tons of U.S. Rice Arrive in Shanghai, Over 20,000 Tons Still En Route

[U.S. Information Service, This City] Gilbert R. Layton, director of the U.S. Department of State's aid mission to China stationed in Shanghai, announced today that the U.S. transport ship "Steel Architect" arrived in Shanghai on the 10th carrying 495 long tons of U.S. relief rice. Since the launch of the "U.S. Aid" transport on January 12, the total amount of rice, wheat, and flour supplied by the United States has now exceeded a record of 70,000 long tons. Another ten ships carrying a total of 24,000 long tons of "U.S. Aid" relief rice are currently en route to China. Four of them have already left U.S. ports and are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in the second half of this month. They are: "Shentang Victory" carrying 1,471 long tons of rice, "Pacific Transport" carrying 1,991 long tons of rice, "President Jefferson" carrying 415 long tons of war provisions, and "President McKinley" carrying 1,000 long tons of rice. The "U.S. Aid" program to China currently being implemented by the U.S. Aid Mission in Shanghai stipulates that a total of 176,000 long tons of staple grains will be delivered to China before July of this year.

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the Shanghai office of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling U.S. Relief Materials, as of March 8, a total of 589,938 bags of flour, 190,799 bags of wheat, and 196,132 bags of rice have been shipped to China, including 140,775 bags of flour shipped to Tianjin, and 5,000 bags of rice shipped to Nanjing.

### Former UNRRA Staff in Shanghai Says Much Relief Goods are Wasted

[United Press, Cairo, 9th] The Evening Star today published an interview with An Lai, a former UNRRA staff member in Shanghai, along with a photograph, proving that most of the food and equipment provided by the United States to China are wasted or flow into the black market. It is claimed that "only a small portion of the relief goods are shipped out for essential use. Seventy-five fishing boats worth $2 million supplied by the United States to China are left unused. I still support relief to China, but it must be ensured that the relief is handled properly."

### Where Did the Circulation Coupons Go?

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 10th] As a result of inflation in the Northeast, the credit of circulation coupons has plummeted. The amount issued may reach more than five trillion. However, during the issuance of circulation coupons, a strange phenomenon was discovered, that is, there is a severe shortage of chips in Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, and other places, resulting in the use of promissory notes. The cash held by various banks and bureaus is far from the amount needed for expenditures. Where did the circulation coupons go? This has become a mystery. According to people familiar with finance, there are about three channels: (1) Bandits use them to purchase goods, which takes time. (2) Bandits smuggle them into Guannei for use. As a result, circulation coupons in Pingjin are flooded after the opening of Northeast trade exchanges. (3) Some were destroyed by artillery fire. This issue deserves special attention, because the destruction of the value of circulation coupons and the flow of materials to the bandit areas are both major loopholes in the Northeast economy.

### Legislative Principles Draft for Provincial and County Self-Government Begin with Provincial and County Councils and Will Be Submitted to the State Council

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The legislative principles of the Provincial and County Self-Government General Rules have been reviewed and approved by the Legislative Committee of the National Government and will soon be submitted to the State Council for discussion. The draft differs slightly from the one drafted by the Ministry of Interior. Among them, the principle of implementing self-government is to begin with provincial and county councils. After the council term expires, popular elections for county magistrates will be held. The term of this council period is rigidly stipulated in the draft, with county councils having a term of two years and provincial councils having a term of three years. After the term expires, popular elections for county magistrates will be held. When the number of popularly elected county magistrates in a province exceeds one-half of the total number of counties in the province, popular elections for provincial governors will be held.

### If China is not Actively Aided, a Third World War May be Inevitable, Chennault Said While Testifying in the House

[News from Our Newspaper] New York, 10th Broadcast: Washington News, General Chennault testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee today, forcefully arguing that military aid to China can help prevent "Soviet aggression in Europe"; otherwise, if such aid is not given to China, the world will embark on the road to a third world war, which is inevitable. Chen's statement, which he read, was thirteen pages long, in which he pointed out that if China's large population can be properly trained, equipped, and supplied, it can provide almost unlimited manpower for military operations. This manpower not being used by the Soviet Union is of the greatest significance to the United States. Given the importance of China's strategic position, it is not difficult to imagine that the Soviet Union would not dare to launch an offensive in Europe rashly before China is communized. In other words, as long as China remains our ally and friend, a third world war is unlikely to occur. The main points of Chen's testimony are as follows: (1) World peace is currently threatened by the expansionist policies pursued by communist leaders around the world; (2) A strong, independent, and anti-communist Chinese National Government is our only hope in Asia to stop communism and maintain world peace. Due to the important strategic position of China geographically, it must occupy an important position in the overall plan to prevent communism. If China becomes a communist country, then the Asian continent will be completely communized, leaving us with no foothold in Asia; (3) After more than ten years of war, China's resources have been exhausted. If the anti-communist National Government is to continue to exist, it must be given substantial military, economic, and financial assistance; (4) If the United States cannot provide adequate assistance to China at this time, it will cause the greatest failure in the history of our foreign policy, making a third world war inevitable.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Ambassador Stuart met with Foreign Minister Wang Shijie at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the afternoon and left after talking for about one hour.

### Agricultural Loan Decision to Proceed First, Industrial Loans to be Handled on a Case-by-Case Basis; Full Economic Council to Discuss Export Material Production Increase Plan Today

[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] The Four Banks Joint Council will hold a routine meeting on the 11th to discuss agricultural and industrial loan plans. According to reliable sources, it has been decided that agricultural loans will be opened up first, while the opening of industrial loans will be temporarily slowed down. Instead, a case-by-case handling method will be adopted. For particularly important and urgently needed loans, the Four Banks Joint Council may consider the situation and approve them on a special case basis. This decision was made because the authorities, in view of the recent surge in prices, feared that the opening of industrial loans would further stimulate prices. Therefore, policymakers presented a compromise plan to the authorities, which was approved. On the one hand, the overall opening of industrial loans will be temporarily delayed, and on the other hand, the particularly urgent needs of industrial and mining loans will also be taken into account. The final decision will be made at the Four Banks Joint Council meeting on the 11th. In addition to the agricultural loan plan which is expected to be fully decided, the entire industrial loan plan will be temporarily postponed. Furthermore, the Full Economic Council's opinion that industrial loans should be coordinated with agricultural loans will also be raised for discussion at the Four Banks Joint Council meeting on the 11th.

[Our Nanjing Office, 10th] The Full Economic Council is scheduled to hold a routine meeting on the 11th, chaired by Wang Yunwu, to discuss the increase production plans for four export materials proposed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry: tung oil, hog bristles, tea leaves, and sheep wool.

Promulgation of Income Tax Collection Law; Executive Yuan Has Not Changed the Law

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] Director Dong Xian Guang answered reporters' inquiries regarding two issues on the 10th. (1) The recently announced "Measures for the Collection of Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax for the 37th Year" by the Executive Yuan is a set of collection procedures formulated based on laws and regulations, which falls within the scope of administrative orders and does not change the tax law. According to the Organic Law of the National Government, the State Council is the highest authority of the government and has the power to issue emergency administrative orders. During the period of mobilization for the suppression of rebellion, this measure is necessary to prevent delays in tax payment and to contract the currency. (2) "Measuring expenditure by income" is the principle of national financial management. The increase in the national annual revenue and expenditure budget and the income tax revenue budget this year are both around twenty times. The current six-fold estimation is just a prepayment of a portion of the tax. Moreover, the average price level in various places in the 36th year has increased by about fifteen times compared to the 35th year. Even if the level of profit does not increase and decrease completely in proportion to the price level, the monetary amount of income of various industries will inevitably increase and decrease with the amount of currency or the price level. Therefore, the six-fold estimation standard, from any perspective, is only a portion of the tax payable. The result of future audits is that, except for businesses that have actual losses, taxes will have to be made up. If it is determined that there are actual losses and a tax refund should be given, the government will also pay interest. The United Kingdom and the United States both implement the "pay as you earn" method, where the tax levied on income this year is the income of the previous year. In fact, the six-fold estimation is equivalent to a method of paying taxes in installments, not a pre-collection, which is beneficial to the industrial and commercial sectors.

Editorial

### The Future of the Ashida Cabinet

The Japanese Katayama Cabinet resigned en masse on February 10th. After the Diet elected Hitoshi Ashida as Prime Minister, Ashida proceeded to organize a coalition cabinet. After half a month of twists and turns, Ashida finally overcame the risks and formed a coalition cabinet of the Democratic, Socialist, and Cooperative parties on the 9th of this month. In terms of policy, a three-party policy agreement has been established, and Ashida's future policy program has a guideline. In terms of personnel, the Democratic Party occupies six seats in the new cabinet, with Prime Minister Ashida concurrently serving as Foreign Minister; the Socialist Party occupies eight seats in the new cabinet, with Suehiro Nishio holding the position of Minister of State and Deputy Prime Minister; and the Cooperative Party only occupies two seats, serving as an embellishment to the coalition government. Looking at the representative character of the Ashida cabinet's composition and its policy decisions, we can make the following observations about the future of the Ashida cabinet.

Regarding the criticism of the Ashida cabinet's character, it may be useful to compare and contrast it with the Katayama cabinet. The Katayama cabinet was led by the leader of the Socialist Party as Prime Minister, supported by the first-party seats in the House of Representatives, and its cabinet policy was based on the call to implement socialism, but it ended with a lifespan of only eight months and ten days. The reasons for this were due to the internal division between the left and right wings of the Socialist Party, the threat of the conservative New Party movement led by Yoshida, and the hesitation and indecision of Tetsu Katayama, which led to the inevitable downfall of the cabinet. However, the main factor in its failure was that the Socialist cabinet members valued the life of the cabinet more than the party's policies. When the two were difficult to reconcile, they had to embark on a path of disillusionment. In order to cherish the life of the regime, the Katayama cabinet had to make concessions to other parties, especially the Democratic Party, in everything. No policy that would have won the support of the Japanese working masses emerged. Even the Coal Mine National Management Bill, which was the most emphasized policy of the socialists, became a non-entity due to the pressure of the Democratic Party, with no socialist atmosphere at all. After the British Labour Party formed a cabinet, the first major event in domestic policy was the implementation of coal mine nationalization. Labour cabinet members and members of parliament were not afraid of difficulties or setbacks, and the British Labour Party finally achieved success and laid the foundation for today's stable political base. However, in the Katayama cabinet, because the experiment of socialism failed, it lost the support of the working masses. Its policies and achievements were the same as those of pure conservative cabinets like Shidehara and Yoshida, so it was bound to encounter failure. Now that the Ashida cabinet has been established, judging from its actions in forming the cabinet in eighteen days, the character of the Ashida cabinet is completely the same as that of the Katayama cabinet. It also values the life of the cabinet more than the life of the party, and its failure in the future seems to be predestined.

The three-party policy agreement that the Ashida cabinet regards as its guiding principle is completely centered on the Socialist Party's主張. Ashida has accepted more or less the Socialist Party's left-wing demands for agricultural land reform, revision of the Labor Union Law, suspension of interest payments on wartime public bonds, and the establishment of property taxes. Ashida himself is relatively conservative, a person who is center-right. His advocacy of revised capitalism lacks a solid theoretical foundation. His friendship with the left wing and acceptance of the left wing's proposals are purely due to the bureaucratic political concept of profit and power. As for whether it will work in the future or how it will work, he does not ask. Therefore, we say that the three-party policy agreement of the Ashida cabinet is more progressive in terms of provisions than the four-party policy agreement of the Katayama cabinet, but its results are likely to be more conservative, more right-leaning, and more difficult to cash in than the Katayama cabinet. In terms of the Ashida cabinet's personnel, the Socialist Party occupies eight cabinet seats, while the Democratic Party only occupies six, which shows that the Socialist Party occupies an absolute advantage in this new cabinet and has the power to manipulate and veto. There is no doubt that Ashida's future actions will inevitably accommodate the Socialist Party in everything, especially making concessions to the left wing of the Socialist Party. This time, the left wing occupies two seats in the cabinet, with Kajū Katō serving as the Minister of Labor and Masaru Nomizo serving as the Minister of State (without portfolio), which is difficult to cooperate with the right wing of the party and the Democratic Party. It is feared that the cabinet will break down due to friction, which is difficult to avoid.

Indeed, the emergence of the Ashida cabinet is mainly due to obtaining the understanding of the left and right wings of the Socialist Party, especially the strong support of the left wing; otherwise, it would be suppressed by opposition parties such as the Liberal Party, the All-Farmers faction, and the Comrades Club in the Diet. Why does Ashida tolerate the left wing? As mentioned above, he is driven by the pursuit of profit and power, and his purpose is not to use this as a decoration of "democracy," directly deceiving the Japanese working masses and indirectly creating the "stability" of the cabinet. Therefore, in his mind, there is no intention to accept their proposals at all. However, Ashida Hitoshi has a "far-reaching" revenge that we must point out: he intends to seize favorable circumstances when the Japanese peace conference is convened to create a "victory of Japan's defeat." He also intends to use the contradiction between the United States and the Soviet Union under the slogan of anti-Sovietism to win greater material assistance from the United States in order to revive Japanese militarism. This is his political ambition! This newspaper's editorial on February 24th pointed out that Ashida's appearance on stage, full of ambition, will inevitably take Japanese politics a step backward and a step reactionary. Ashida's political foundation is an old form of Japan, and he may brazenly and resolutely revive militarism. This is what we worry about. As for the weaknesses of the Ashida cabinet, they lie in the unsoundness of its policies and personnel. Therefore, its life is likely to be shorter than that of the Katayama cabinet. Although Ashida himself is known as a "cold talent," judging from his ability to form a cabinet this time, it is difficult to overcome the contradictions between the Democratic Party and the Socialist Party, and the damage caused to the cabinet by the opposition between the left and right wings of the Socialist Party. Now that Takao Saito, the honorary president of the Democratic Party, has left the party, and the Taiyo Society has raised the banner against the left wing, Ashida's style of befriending fellow party members while alienating his comrades shows that he is so focused on power that he may not even need the support of the masses and comrades. This bureaucratic style will not be abandoned by the times unless the world is completely running against the tide. Therefore, we predict that the life of the Ashida cabinet and Ashida's personal political life will be a very short page in Japanese political history. We believe that this is Japan's misfortune. After Ashida's failure in the future, it is possible that more conservative and stubborn figures than Ashida will emerge, which will further create Japan's misfortune. In short, Japanese politics is increasingly turning backward. The political evolution of the past two years has truly given people a feeling that each generation is not as good as the previous one.

### Jiangxi Grain Is Continuously Transported to Zhejiang and Guangdong; Guangzhou Purchases 3,300 piculs of Rice in Hankou

[Our Hangzhou Office, 10th] Zhejiang grain merchants previously purchased 40,000 zu (unit of grain) of rice in Jiangxi Province due to a shortage of grain. However, the grain could not be transported to Zhejiang because the Jiangxi Provincial Government banned grain from leaving the province. After the Zhejiang Provincial Delegation to Jiangxi Province negotiated the exchange of materials between the two provinces, the Jiangxi Provincial Government agreed to release the grain. Therefore, more than 1,000 bags of rice have been entering the province via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway every day, which has alleviated the rice shortage.

### National Federation of Highway Workers' Unions to be Established in Beijing Today

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The National Federation of Highway Workers' Unions of the Republic of China is now ready and will be established tomorrow, the 11th, at 10:00 AM. The first general assembly of representatives will also be convened to elect the first board of directors. Miao Yin-sheng, Standing Committee Member of the Preparatory Committee, and Gui Yun-kang, Secretary-General, reported at a press conference on the afternoon of the 10th that the main tasks of the Federation after its establishment will be to organize highway workers in various regions, fully leverage their road maintenance and transportation efficiency, assist the government in suppressing rebellion, and strive to improve employee welfare and secure reasonable treatment. [Central News Agency, Tianjin, 10th] An Fu-ting, Chairman of the China Labor Association, expressed extreme contempt for Zhu Xue-fan's theft of his name and his absurd remarks made in the bandit-controlled area of ​​Harbin. According to An, Zhu Xue-fan fled in fear of punishment after being wanted by the court for corruption. The chairmanship of the China Labor Association was then re-elected. Currently, Zhu has no union membership in the country and cannot represent this body, let alone Chinese workers. This association has already issued statements both domestically and abroad. The Chinese Seamen's Union, Postal Workers' Union, Railway Workers' Union, and others have also jointly stated that they do not recognize his qualifications to represent Chinese workers. In the past, we have viewed all of Zhu's actions as those of a communist bandit accomplice, and he has long been expelled from the Kuomintang. He is essentially a fugitive criminal who shamelessly claims to be a disciple of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and impersonates a representative of Chinese workers in an attempt to confuse the public. This is extremely shameless, and the fact that the communist bandits harbor such scum proves that birds of a feather flock together.

Article 1: Except for counties (cities) that have already conducted simple land declaration and clearing, or measurement and registration, and have thoroughly organized their cadastral records, the land tax in various provinces shall be cleared in accordance with the provisions of these measures. However, counties and cities with the manpower and financial resources to carry out land consolidation shall still carry out land consolidation.

Article 2: The work of collecting land tax in various provinces shall be carried out by the provincial government in conjunction with the provincial grain authority, together with the finance and land administration authorities, to formulate practical plans and measures. After approval by the central government, the county (city) governments shall be ordered to supervise the county (city) grain authorities to implement them.

Article 3: When counties (cities) conduct land tax clearing, the county (city) government shall supervise the county (city) grain authority to establish an investigation team. The county (city) magistrate shall concurrently serve as the team leader, and the director of the county (city) grain office or the head of the grain section shall concurrently serve as the deputy team leader. The team shall be divided into several sub-teams, each with one technician and a number of investigators. The technician shall concurrently serve as the sub-team leader, and the township head shall concurrently serve as the sub-team deputy, supervising the investigators and the Bao-Tian chiefs to carry out the work.

The aforementioned investigators shall be recruited from the land tax collectors of various townships and towns as much as possible. When necessary, temporary technicians and employees may be selected and hired. In addition to technicians and employees who may be given allowances and travel expenses according to local prices, the rest shall be unpaid, but may be given public travel expenses.

Article 4: During the period of land tax clearing in each county (city), the county (city) government and the county (city) grain authority shall select senior personnel to conduct roving supervision in various districts and pay appropriate travel expenses.

Article 5: The procedure for clearing land tax is as follows:

(1) Field-by-field investigation: Land tax clearing shall be carried out by township as a unit. Investigators shall be dispatched, together with the township head, to survey the boundaries of the county (city) township (town) and erect markers. The natural terrain within a township (town), such as mountains, rivers, and roads, shall be used as reference, and the existing Bao boundaries shall be consulted to divide the township into several sections. Before investigating each field in each section, the technician shall first measure the standard fields of various types in the section to determine their area as the standard for converting the area during the field-by-field investigation. Then, the investigators shall carry land registers and, together with the local Bao-Tian chief, investigate the location, boundaries, acreage, yield, income, land price, tax amount, land type, land quality, owner's name, address, user's name, address, and other items of the land field by field and register them one by one in the land register (the format of the register will be determined separately). The register shall be numbered sequentially, starting and ending with each section.

(2) Verification of Deeds by Household: After the land investigation of each section is completed, the sub-team shall immediately notify the owners, together with the township office, to bring their deeds, grain strings, and other relevant documents to the township office where the land is located for verification. After receiving the above documents, the investigators shall immediately check them one by one against the items investigated in the land register. If the verification is correct, the owner, Bao chief, and the person in charge shall affix their seals or fingerprints on the land register, and affix a "Verified" stamp on the upper left corner of the original deed, and issue a deed verification certificate together with the original documents. If there is any discrepancy, the discrepancy shall be investigated and the original deed or register shall be corrected accordingly. The correction shall be stamped with the private seal of the person in charge to show caution. For public and jointly owned land, the names and addresses of the representatives and co-owners shall be filled in detail in the remarks column. If it is a white deed (a deed without official stamp), it shall be registered in a separate register (the format of the register will be determined separately), and the tax shall be waived for three months after the deed verification. For land without a deed, the owner shall obtain a certificate from the neighborhood Bao-Jia chief, and the county (city) government shall issue a public notice. If no objection is raised within one month, the ownership shall be recognized, and the penalty for tax evasion shall be waived and the tax shall be levied lightly within three months after the expiration of the public notice period. If the tax is still not paid after the deadline, the penalties shall be imposed in accordance with the current measures for fines for deed tax evasion.

A fee may be charged for the aforementioned deed verification certificate and land register to cover the cost of materials. The charging standard shall be drafted by the provincial government and reported to the Ministry of Food for approval.

When an owner presents a deed for verification, he shall report his real name. If he does not use his real name, he shall be punished in accordance with the regulations on the restriction of the use of names after investigation. (To be continued)

### Only Two Weeks After the Communist Coup in Czechoslovakia, Masaryk Jumped to His Death: Son of Founding Father Sacrifices Himself for the People

[Associated Press, Prague, 10th] The family of Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk stated on the 10th that Masaryk committed suicide by jumping from the Qiu Ning Palace official residence, fourteen days after the communist coup. Masaryk was the son of Thomas Masaryk, the founding father and first president of Czechoslovakia, and was 61 years old this year. His family said that he had been depressed since the political turmoil on the 25th of last month. After announcing his willingness to continue serving, he refused to meet with old friends and Western journalists. On Sunday evening, after attending an official banquet commemorating his father's 99th birthday, he wandered alone by the tomb of the elder Masaryk. He committed suicide on the 10th. Masaryk is the second person to jump out of a window and commit suicide after the coup. Former Minister of Justice Doutetna also attempted to jump out of a window and commit suicide, resulting in a fractured skull.

[Reuters, Prague, 10th] An official gazette from the Czech Prime Minister's Office stated: "As a result of illness and insomnia, Foreign Minister Masaryk ended his life, which he had dedicated to the country, on the 10th. His decision to commit suicide was likely made in a moment of mental breakdown." An hour later, another announcement was issued stating, "On the day before Masaryk's tragic death or last night, he did not show any signs of mental abnormality."

[Reuters, Prague, 10th] An hour after announcing Masaryk's jump to his death, Prime Minister Gotwald issued a message to the Czech people, stating: "People of Czechoslovakia, this is not a time for despair. Although a great man has left us, it should not be assumed that the situation in our country will worsen due to his death. We hope that the public will remain calm, continue their work as usual, and that gatherings and demonstrations will not be allowed except to express mourning. Our enemies of freedom may use this opportunity to incite disturbances, which the authorities will resolutely deal with."

[Reuters, Prague, 10th] A few moments before noon today, Prague was almost completely isolated from the outside world. Outgoing telephone calls were not connected, and service was not restored until the official announcement was issued.

[Another Dispatch] As of now, there have been no public demonstrations in the Czech capital. Only small groups of two or three people can be seen whispering on the streets, with grief overflowing from their faces. The government has ordered the national flag to be flown at half-mast, and private residences have also voluntarily hung black flags to express mourning. Although the general public is shocked, they are all cautious.

### The World Is Greatly Shocked: Masaryk's Neutral Force Unable to Exert Influence, the Communist Party's Usurpation of Power Completely Exposed

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] After learning of the death of the Czech Foreign Minister, Truman's Press Secretary Ross made the following statement: "The President has just learned of Masaryk's suicide by telephone. Before issuing a formal statement tonight, the President wishes to state that he believes that the suicide of this great man was not due to a nervous breakdown or insomnia, but due to the great political changes in that country over the past two weeks." Secretary of State Marshall said that the representative opinion he had received was that Masaryk was forced to accept the position of Foreign Minister. "When I learned that Masaryk had decided to accept a position in a regime condemned by democratic countries, I was very surprised. His suicide proves that a government controlled by the Communist Party cannot be tolerated by the son of the founder of the Czech Republic."

Success Lake was shocked to learn of Masaryk's death.

[Reuters, London, 10th] Diplomatic circles here believe that Masaryk's suicide has exposed the facade of the government controlled by the Czech Communist Party. His continued service in the government after the coup was cited by freedom-thinking elements who supported the new government as proof that the recent coup was unconstitutional. From the perspective of foreign public opinion, Masaryk's participation in the new Czech government was even more important than that of President Benes, as he was the son of the creator of the Czech Republic, the elder Masaryk, and was nothing less than a symbol of the traditional democratic spirit of the Czech Republic. His jump to his death has proven that his continued tenure as Foreign Minister and his public statements about the coup were the result of coercion. Some people also said that Masaryk's failure to immediately withdraw from the cabinet was originally intended to maintain some neutral force in the new government, but since the government reorganization, followed by the purge and various measures to destroy freedom, it is clear that the neutral force has been unable to exert influence, and he had no choice but to resort to suicide. Democratic people here believe that Masaryk's death is nothing less than a final protest against the Czech coup twenty-one days ago.

[Reuters, Paris, 10th] After learning of the suicide of the Czech Foreign Minister, a spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry said that the French government deeply regrets the death of this great man at this time, which proves that the Communist Party's control of the entire Czech Republic has sentenced democracy to death.

### Czech New Government Clears Dissidents

Benes' Brother Resigns as Member of Parliament, an Employee of the U.S. Consulate Arrested

[United Press, Prague, 9th] The U.S. Embassy in Czechoslovakia announced that Spiro, a Czech translator at the U.S. Consulate in Bratislava, was arrested by the Czech authorities on the evening of the 8th and interrogated on charges of "conspiracy to treason." U.S. officials in Washington said that the Czech Communist Party-controlled government was trying to manufacture evidence of a "spy conspiracy" and intended to involve U.S. diplomats. Spiro's arrest may be the first step in the plan. An official said that the new Czech government continues to consolidate its power, purge opposition leaders, amend Czech laws, and recruit new party members to strengthen the Communist Party.

[Reuters, Prague, 9th] President Benes' brother, Vojtech Benes, has resigned as a member of the Social Democratic Party in the Czech Parliament. It is also learned that the "Slovak Democratic Party" has decided to change its name to the "Slovak Regeneration Party" by a decision of the party's action committee. Former party chairman Litry Chu and several members of parliament have been expelled from the party.

### Masaryk's Brief Biography

Jan (given name) Masaryk (family name), 61 years old, is the son of Thomas (given name) Masaryk (family name), the founding father and first President of Czechoslovakia. After last week's coup, his continued service as Foreign Minister in the new government controlled by the Communist Party surprised Western observers. Masaryk was approachable, a firm believer in Western democracy, and had a close friendship with British and American diplomats. He has been the Czech Foreign Minister since 1940, first in the London government-in-exile, and continued to serve as Foreign Minister after returning to the country after liberation. He was a non-partisan. He was born in Vienna and studied in Prague and New York. In 1938, he was originally the Czech Ambassador to the United Kingdom, but he resigned that winter after the Munich Agreement was signed. He entered the diplomatic service after the establishment of the Czech Republic and had served in the Czech Embassy in London for sixteen years until he resigned as Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1938. He first served as a counselor, and then in 1925 he was transferred to be the Ambassador until 1938. In 1939, he went to the United States to lecture. When he returned to London, Czechoslovakia had been annexed by the Nazis, so he washed his hands and participated in the Czech National Committee. In 1941, the Czech provisional government-in-exile led by Benes was recognized by the Allies, and he was appointed as Foreign Minister. In 1945, he represented Czechoslovakia at the first United Nations conference. Masaryk was poor in his early years. In 1907, he was a worker in an iron factory. Later, he worked as a pianist in a theater. Finally, he became a director of the Klein Steel Plant. His wife, Frances Klein, was the daughter of the U.S. Minister to Beijing, China in 1924.

According to reliable sources, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have already accepted the amendments proposed by Britain to the draft Western European Union Convention on various issues. However, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg believe that the British proposal regarding overseas territories is too far from the provision in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg draft that mutual assistance is limited to the home country, so they are not yet willing to accept it immediately.

He stated: "The Allied Forces' 'occupation policy' towards Japan is unprecedentedly tolerant and benevolent in history.

### International Trade Union Conference Opens, Unanimously Endorsing the Marshall Plan

[Reuters London, 9th] The International Trade Union Conference to discuss the Marshall Plan opened this morning in the Transport House, with the participation of 48 representatives from 26 major trade unions in the United States and Western Europe. The two major trade unions in the United States, the Congress of Industrial Organizations and the American Federation of Labor, both sent representatives to attend. There were no representatives from Portugal, Turkey, Iceland, or the National General Confederation of Labor of France and Italy. The chairperson of the conference, Ms. Hancock, Chairperson of the British Trades Union Congress, addressed the conference, emphasizing that the division of the international trade union movement should not prevent those who can agree from participating in the work of European recovery. Basto, a non-communist representative of the Italian National General Confederation of Labor, stated that the Italian people do not disapprove of the European recovery plan. Italian workers are all seeking assistance under the Marshall Plan. He also believes that the European recovery plan must fully cooperate with the trade unions of various countries, and each country must fully utilize the assistance to improve the living standards of the trade unions.

### U.S. Advises Arab-Jewish Reconciliation on Palestine Partition Issue, U.S.-Soviet Policies Gradually Becoming Uncoordinated

[United Press Success Lake, 9th] Coordination between the United States and the Soviet Union on the Palestine issue in the United Nations appeared to have ended on the 9th. A senior Soviet official told visitors that the United States is "hesitating and indecisive" about implementing the United Nations' plan to partition the Holy Land. He said that U.S. officials seem to want to reopen the Holy Land issue and start over. U.S. Representative Austin replied in an official statement that the Soviet official "did not wait for the recent termination of the discussion of the great powers and immediately speculated on the matter." This U.S.-Soviet discord is the culmination of developments in all aspects, and the behind-the-scenes situation is also becoming tense. The United Nations Secretariat believes that the Security Council has the right to support the partition plan with international military force, which has been protested by the United States. The extent of the U.S.-Soviet split cannot be immediately determined, but some observers believe that Austin's statement is a signal that months of coordination are coming to an end. The position of the United Nations Secretariat has been supported by the Soviet Union, at least in part. Other major developments are as follows:

(1) A senior Soviet official said that the Soviet Union will insist that the United Nations' plan to partition the Holy Land must be implemented, while other countries (presumably China, the United States, and France) seem to be hesitant about implementing this plan. (2) A U.S. spokesperson said that the United States is advising the Arab Higher Committee to abandon its boycott of the United Nations and participate in the ongoing negotiations of the great powers. The United States is also asking the seven Arab League countries to persuade the Arab Committee to negotiate with any of the five great powers or the Security Council. (3) According to a major power, there has been some "talk" proposing to extend the date of partition and the establishment of the United Nations trusteeship. (4) The emergency talks of the great powers reopened on the 9th, and British officials also attended and participated, but they only agreed to provide information and were unwilling to participate in the implementation of the partition plan.

[Central News Agency New Delhi, 9th] Nehru stated in Parliament yesterday that the United Kingdom and India have not discussed the issue of India continuing to be affiliated with the British Commonwealth. Regardless of the final decision, I firmly believe that India will be a fully independent country. However, we must still consider the relationship we should have with the United Kingdom, the British Commonwealth, or any group. This is not just a theoretical issue, but a very practical one. Nehru's practical and cautious approach to the issue of India's relationship with the British Commonwealth is consistent with his realistic foreign policy.

### "Explorer" Returns to U.S. with "Illness," Survey of Mount積石 Postponed, 雷諾 Announces Pen Manufacturing in Shanghai

[Our Reporter] The special plane "Explorer" of the 雷諾積石 Mountain Exploration Team, which had been stranded at the Longhua Airport in this city for many days, finally took off at 3:45 pm yesterday. However, the destination was no longer Nanjing, but Los Angeles in the United States, which will postpone the surveying and exploration work of Sino-American Mount積石 by two weeks. 雷諾 specifically held a press conference at 5 pm yesterday to explain the matter. It is said that the "Explorer" special plane had been thoroughly inspected before leaving the United States, and all parts were intact. However, after arriving at Wake Island overnight, oil leakage was discovered in the cylinder, which was repaired. After arriving in Shanghai and preparing to fly to Beijing, two new gaps were found in the oil cylinder. Although it was rushed to repair, the cylinder function could not be restored to normal. The hourly oil leakage was about half a gallon, so the plane had to be flown back to Los Angeles for thorough repair. The preparation for surveying and exploration work has cost a lot so far. Even the round trip to the United States costs as much as US$25,000. However, since the "Explorer" has oil leakage symptoms, there may be a risk of explosion during the flight. The driver 奥登 is carrying all the necessary defense equipment and is willing to take the risk to fly the plane. Zhu Chao, a lieutenant in the Air Force of 山國, is also willing to fly to the United States with the plane to gain more flight experience, which is commendable. The special plane will be repaired for about two weeks before it can return to China. I plan to take another flight to Beijing on the morning of the 11th with Major Yang Dize and others to discuss the progress plan of surveying and exploration work with the scientists staying in Beijing, or will go to Lanzhou together first to carry out preparatory work.

Finally, 雷諾 talked about his plan to set up an atomic pen factory in Shanghai. He said: "The factory plan has been sponsored by Madam Chiang Kai-shek, and he has prepared all the machinery and equipment for setting up the factory. It is expected to start manufacturing in Shanghai after April. All the profits from the factory will be allocated to Madam Chiang Kai-shek for charitable relief work."

### Airfares to Be Adjusted Starting Tomorrow, Approved by Ministry of Communications, Increase of 45%, International Routes Still Converted at Original Foreign Currency Prices

The fares of all routes of China Central and China National Aviation Corporations have been approved by the Ministry of Communications to increase by 45% based on the original price starting from the 12th. According to Liu Jingyi, the general manager of China National Aviation Corporation, it has been more than a month since the civil aviation fares were adjusted on February 7. During this period, foreign exchange and gasoline prices have been increased repeatedly, especially the sharp increase in the cost of living, which has made the company unbearable. The authorities of the two companies requested the Ministry of Communications to adjust the fares at the end of February. The Ministry of Communications approved the request on the 10th. From the end of February to March 11, the price increase rate was very rapid, especially the increase of 46,000 yuan in foreign exchange, which gave the airline a great stimulus. According to the current expenditure of the company, it should increase by 52.5% based on the original price. Therefore, although the fare has been adjusted, the actual difference between revenue and expenditure is still 7.5%. The calculation method of civil aviation fares is based on the amount of expenditure on foreign exchange, gasoline, and cost of living. The prices of the main routes after the price increase are as follows: (1) Shanghai-Beijing Route: 990,000 yuan. (2) Shanghai-Chongqing Route: 8,225,000 yuan. (3) Beijing-Chongqing Route: 5,180,000 yuan. (4) Shanghai-Hankou Route: 6,670,000 yuan. (5) Hankou-Chongqing Route: 5,945,000 yuan. (6) Shanghai-Guangzhou Route: 7,395,000 yuan. (7) Shanghai-Hong Kong Route: 11,600,000 yuan. (8) Shanghai-Kunming Route: 7,715,000 yuan. (9) Shanghai-Taiwan Route: 28,855,000 yuan. International routes are still converted at the original foreign currency prices.

Overpaid Fares Can Be Refunded

[Another News] According to the person in charge of China National Aviation Corporation, the Ministry of Communications telegraphed the two companies before the 10th of this month, stating that the fare would increase by 30% starting from March 11. Therefore, the tickets sold by China National Aviation Corporation on the 10th for the 11th had already increased by 30% based on the original price.

For several consecutive days, details of the criminals' names, addresses, service units, and negotiation process were thoroughly understood. On the 6th of this month, the date of delivery was negotiated. When the time came, Battalion Commander Xie dispatched armed and plainclothes personnel to hide nearby and wait. Around 4:00 PM that afternoon, it was seen that Wang Siyuan, the arsenal storekeeper, was carrying a package into the hotel. The constables waiting saw that the time was ripe, rushed forward, and arrested Wang. The package he was carrying contained three revolvers, one pistol, and over one hundred rounds of ammunition. Based on Wang's confession and the clues obtained from the investigation, the accomplices Wang Bingni, Di Qingshan, and Yi Guohua were arrested at the arsenal, along with the relevant senior officials. A light machine gun, a quick-firing rifle, and a revolver, all hidden and awaiting sale, were found in the homes of the two criminals, Wang and Di, along with forty rounds of ammunition. All criminals in the case are currently being held at the Independent Third Battalion of the Constabulary. According to Battalion Commander Xie: the personnel responsible for guarding the arms and ammunition engaged in embezzlement, stealing the arms and ammunition and selling them privately. This not only violates the law, but also affects social security, which is extremely sinful. It is reported that when the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters held a garrison meeting a few days ago, Commander Xuan also took note of this and ordered strict inspections and precautions against institutions responsible for guarding arms and ammunition in the future, so as to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.

### Wu Yun Chu and Others Travel to the Capital Yesterday to Seek Solutions to the Industrial Crisis

Wu Yun Chu, chairman of the China National Federation of Industries, and executive directors Tao Guilin, Shen Silang, Pan Yangshan, Yin Zhizhong, chief secretary Zhuang Zhihuan, and others, six people in total, took a late night train to the capital yesterday. This morning, they will carry a letter and meet with the Executive Yuan, the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and other authorities. According to Wu: This trip was entrusted to the Industrial Association, because the industry has suffered a serious blow before IT. If it is not resolved, with the shrinking production of local products, China's economy will become more difficult, the problem of worker unemployment will expand, and social security will also be affected. I hope that the central authorities will pay close attention to it.

### Fertilizer and Explosives: Inside View of the Yongli Chemical Company Ammonia Plant

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] After the First World War, the first thing the Allied Powers did in exerting pressure on Germany was to make Germany announce the method of synthesizing nitrogen from the air. (Nitrogen refers to ammonia, formerly known as , which was renamed after the Ministry of Education announced the chemical naming principles in November of the 21st year of the Republic of China. The Yongli Ammonia Plant should also be called the Ammonium Plant. Therefore, this article, except for referring to the factory name as the Ammonia Plant as before, generally uses the word "ammonium.") Because synthetic ammonia is an important substance for manufacturing ammonium salts and nitrate fertilizers in peacetime chemical industries, but the equipment for manufacturing can be easily transformed into war industries when necessary, manufacturing powerful explosives. Before this war, Japan's fertilizer industry was highly developed. When the war of aggression was launched, all the fertilizer industries were forcibly transformed into industries manufacturing military chemical raw materials such as sulfuric acid and nitric acid.

Shouldering Two Missions Alone

According to Mr. Hou Debang (General Manager of Yongli and an internationally renowned authority in China's chemical industry) after returning from Japan:

"The production of Japan's fertilizer industry has recovered to 900,000 tons per year, not far from the pre-war peak of 1.2 million tons. Moreover, the Allied Headquarters has decided that the fertilizer industry will absolutely not be used for compensation, and has approved an annual output of over 2 million tons. Clever Japanese chemical industrialists are disguising and preserving all kinds of munitions industries, laying the foundation for the resurgence of aggressive forces." (See "Neptune" Volume 20, Issue 6)

While Japan's fertilizer and explosives chemical industries survived under MacArthur's protection, we should think about ourselves. The work of the Yongli Chemical Company's Ammonia Plant cannot be ignored. China's vast farmlands need fertilizer, and the long national defense lines need explosives. This arduous supply mission seems to fall on Yongli's shoulders at present.

Xiejia Dian's Convenient Waterway

A dozen kilometers downstream from Nanjing, across the river, there is a good deep bay, an inland port where 25,000-ton ships can dock, called Xiejia Dian. Not only is the waterway convenient, but it is also very close to Pukou, the end of the Jinpu Railway. Mr. Fan Xudong, the leader of China's chemical industry, focused on transportation, security, and other conditions, and established Yongli's second largest business here—the Ammonia Plant.

The Ammonia Plant originally occupied 1,500 acres of land, and has now expanded to more than 2,000 acres. Although it only started production on February 5th of the 26th year of the Republic of China, it was suspended half a year later due to the war approaching Nanjing. The responsible personnel disassembled the gauges and control components on the remaining machines after the bombing and moved west with the government. During the period of occupation, it was wantonly ruined by the Japanese invaders for six years. The efforts of the Yongli authorities ensured that they did not fail the opportunity granted by victory. Today, more than a year after resuming work, seeing the precious achievements of the Ammonia Plant in overcoming all difficulties is a pleasant surprise that China actually has a thriving industry, and it also makes people resent the abundance of blind waste and madness in destruction.

Ammonium Sulfate Manufacturing Process

The manufacturing of ammonium sulfate has six important steps. Mr. Xie Weijie, the chief technician (chief engineer) of the factory (he is the younger brother of the female writer Bing Xin, studied chemical engineering in the United States, and has been with Yongli for 19 years), led us on a tour while explaining.

The first part is the gas plant. Air, steam, and coke are used to produce hydrogen and nitrogen, as well as carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. The gas produced here is called crude gas, and it is introduced into

The second part, the oxidation section, where most of the unstable carbon monoxide is converted into carbon dioxide, and then sent to

The third part, the refining section, where carbon dioxide and a small amount of carbon monoxide are washed away with water, and the pure oxygen-nitrogen gas is sent to

The fourth part, the high-pressure section, where it is directly synthesized into liquid ammonia through high pressure and the action of a catalyst, maintaining a suitable temperature, and then transported to a storage tank for ready use.

The fifth part, the sulfuric acid section, where pure sulfuric acid is produced from iron sulfide ore using the contact method and transported to

The sixth part, the ammonium sulfate section, where ammonia and sulfuric acid are neutralized in the channel to form white, uniform crystalline ammonium sulfate, dried, and packaged to become high-quality fertilizer.

Raw Material Coke is Urgently Needed

Among the raw materials for production, coke is currently the most problematic. The gas plant's record book lists the types of carbon used, including those from Pingxiang, Jiangxi; Tianfu, Sichuan; Zhongxing, Xuzhou; and even those from Taiwan, Canada, and Australia. The iron sulfide used to produce sulfuric acid is supplied by the Ma'anshan Mine of the National Resources Commission, which is located nearby, so there is no need to worry about a shortage. Furthermore, there is the issue of power. Until now, it still relies on the Capital Power Plant. Starting from October 19th last year, due to the damage to the cable across the river, work was suspended for more than three months.

Production Volume Increases Monthly

According to Chief Technician Xie, the average daily output of the Ammonia Plant in February was: 29.5 tons of synthetic liquid ammonia, 103 tons of sulfuric acid, and 114.5 tons of ammonium sulfate. However, workers pointed out that the daily output of each department was: more than 40 tons of synthetic liquid ammonia, more than 130 tons of sulfuric acid, and more than 140 tons of ammonium sulfate. The reporter saw in the record book of the sixth part, the ammonium sulfate section, that the output of ammonium sulfate on March 5th was 142.3 tons. In any case, the production volume of the Ammonia Plant is increasing. Chief Technician Xie is very grateful to UNRRA for its help to Yongli. At the beginning of the Yongli Ammonia Plant's restoration, UNRRA sent two experts to Xiejia Dian to conduct a detailed investigation, and decided to not only help restore the previous scale, but also find ways to increase equipment to increase production to three times the pre-war level, or 450 tons per day. The machinery supplied by UNRRA is worth approximately US$1 million, which Yongli will repay to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry with ammonium sulfate over six years.

Two-and-a-Half-Year Expansion Plan

We saw new foundations being laid near the factory buildings, and cranes on the riverbank were lifting timber, bricks, and tiles ashore. In the ironworks, various iron frames and huge boilers were being processed and sand-cast. In the research room and design department, many calm minds were at work. Chief Technician Xie said, "Our expansion plan can be fully completed in two and a half years. Daily production may reach 480 tons." However, even if we calculate it at 500 tons a day, the annual output is still less than 200,000 tons, while Taiwan alone needs 300,000 tons a year. What about Central and Southern China? Chief Technician Xie said that Yongli hopes to expand production by 30 times or even 50 times.

Hou Debang's Ten Years of Effort

Yongli Chemical Company was founded single-handedly by Mr. Fan Xudong, but after Mr. Fan's unfortunate death, he left no inheritance. Mrs. Fan is living in a friend's house in Shanghai. Mr. Hou Debang, who inherited Mr. Fan's legacy, and all the staff of Yongli have not become rich either. Mr. Hou spent ten years researching the alkali production method, striking a blow to the monopoly of the Solvay Group, and making a name for himself in the world. India and Brazil have successively invited him to help improve the alkali production industry, but the foreign exchange remuneration he received has never gone into his own pocket, but has been used to purchase equipment for Yongli. The employees of Yongli are all willing to accept the considerable remuneration given by the factory and live and work diligently.

However, in recent times, the workers have more or less felt that the factory's welfare work is not enough. Although their lowest monthly salary has risen from 15 yuan before the war to more than 20 yuan, the high prices have inevitably put some pressure on their lives. They have appealed to the public for sympathy in Nanjing newspapers more than once, and on January 26th of this year, they were approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Social Affairs to organize an industrial union to fight for their own welfare. However, they still uphold the principle of "business first" and will continue Mr. Fan's ambition to jointly seek industrial development.

Striving to Think for Employees

The factory has a very objective view of the trade union. It believes that the legitimate establishment of this organization can enable the factory to accurately understand the needs of workers' welfare, make improvements, and further enhance work efficiency. The factory acknowledges that there are not enough workers' dormitories, workers' treatment is not high enough, and it also admits that the current production situation has a surplus. However, it also points out that the surplus is not for making money during the accelerated implementation of the expansion plan, and the large number of workers and the difficulty in buying building materials are also difficulties. However, in any case, the factory is always trying its best to think for the employees. The fact that Yongli has never had a strike or other tricks is the most powerful proof.

Installing an Electric Fence to Consolidate the Stronghold

The Ammonia Plant is surrounded by high walls with electric fences installed on top. The security force is also quite strong. In the past few days, when Liuhe was disturbed, the Xiejia Dian factory was still safe. Now, the organization of the trade union has further linked the workers spiritually. This stronghold of national industry will be incomparably strong. The nitric acid equipment looted by the Japanese will soon be shipped back from Osaka. At that time, in addition to fertilizer for enriching the country, Yongli will also supply explosives for strengthening the country. But we still cannot help but hope that the TNT products of the Ammonia Plant will be best used in the construction of YVA. (Our reporter Pu Dejie)

### Suzhou High Procuratorate Continues to Issue Arrest Warrants for Puppet County Magistrate Li Tingzhang, etc.

### Ten Strong Young Men in Jiangyin Attempt to Evade Military Service, Voluntarily Prepare Meals and Pretend to be Police Officers

[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 9th] Since Director Zhang took office as the head of the county police bureau, Cheng Ruwen, a native of Jiaoxi, was appointed as the head of the Shengang Branch Bureau. Recently, for the conscription of soldiers, ten young men of conscription age in Guanshan Township, including Shen Yanghua, Xu Shengfeng, Xu Yinhan, Wang Yude, and Wang Yuceng, hoping to evade service, voluntarily prepared meals and served as police officers in the branch bureau. Out of local sentiment, Branch Bureau Chief Cheng dismissed ten original police chiefs and officers, including Zhang Huanbao, Zhou Xijun, and Jiang Rong, without reason. In order to protect their positions, the dismissed chiefs and officers filed a complaint with the county for relief, and at the same time reported that Branch Bureau Chief Cheng had seized more than 30 million in funds in Dongwei Yard and other places without reporting to the General Bureau, and also charged 6 million per month from the teahouses opened by Zhang Zuhong and five other families in Shengang, guaranteeing gambling and other activities. On the 8th, after receiving the report, Director Zhang sent Inspector Dong Mingzhang to the township to thoroughly investigate. The above facts were all denied, and it was said that they were all caused by the resentment of the dismissed police officers. The District Court Procuratorate has ordered ten dismissed chiefs and officers to be summoned to investigate the truth about Branch Bureau Chief Cheng's corruption and handle it according to law.

### Tangshan Institute Rectifies Academic Atmosphere, Registration is Serious, Many Students are Expelled

[Our Tangshan Dispatch] Tangshan Institute of Technology officially started classes on March 1st. Starting this semester, the school has made the greatest determination to rectify the academic atmosphere. Since the restoration, due to manpower and financial resources, all administrative measures have not met the ideals of the students. Therefore, there are often announcements on the democratic wall attacking the school and exposing the misconduct of the staff in the Academic Affairs Office. After the end of the last semester, there were even major wall newspaper attacks on the school's various unreasonable actions, which attracted the school's attention. Therefore, the school affairs meeting decided on a method to rectify the academic atmosphere. When students registered, the president personally supervised the Academic Affairs Office to prevent illegal cheating. Twenty-nine students who failed more than half of the selected credits were ordered to withdraw. Starting next academic year, auditors will not be accepted. Students who are on leave of absence will not be allowed to select credits, and professors will not have the right to promise to retain credits. The Office of Student Affairs made three rules to control student speech. In the future, wall newspaper groups must first register with the Office of Student Affairs. Students must not post announcements attacking the school and faculty. Anyone can tear off unsigned announcements. This matter has caused surprise among students, but so far there has been no reaction.

Starting this semester, the electrical engineering laboratory and the hydraulic laboratory have been opened. The materials testing laboratory, which was famous throughout the country before the war, is now just an empty house and cannot be restored to its former glory in the short term. Other experimental equipment such as physics, chemistry, and metallurgy have been slightly scaled. However, due to tight funding and expensive chemical prices, the number of student experiments has been reduced to save money.

### High Tuition Fees at Private Middle Schools in Jinan, Students Request Transfers

[Our Jinan dispatch, 10th] Since the tuition fees of private middle schools in Jinan City were changed to flour, students from various private schools have been unable to afford it and have requested transfers to provincial and municipal middle schools. However, the authorities of various private schools have used the excuse of a private middle school friendship meeting to refuse to issue transfer certificates, which has led to repeated disputes. In recent days, more than 40 private middle school students, including Kong Qingquan, have collectively requested the Ministry of Education to: (1) Order various provincial middle schools to recruit more transfer students and relax the deadline for admission procedures, (2) Transfer orders to various private schools to issue transfer certificates; at the same time, the parents of various students have also protested and plan to petition Chairman Wang in the coming days.

### Screening of Students Studying in Japan, Hiring of Graders

[Dahua News Agency, Nanjing] According to the Ministry of Education, since the Ministry handled the screening of students studying in Japan last year, as of now, a total of 1,594 people have applied for registration forms, and 543 people have submitted reports, autobiographies, and essays to the Ministry. It is expected that more will be submitted in the future. The Ministry has now hired graders and will send them out for evaluation. However, among the students who have registered, the Japanese schools from which they graduated or attended are either recognized by the Ministry of Education or not recognized by the Ministry of Education (such as some schools that have not been established in Japan). The Screening Committee has decided to request the Ministry of Education to give students who are not recognized the opportunity to take a screening test. If they pass, their qualifications will be recognized.

### The Educational Situation in the Northeast is Dire, Cultural and Food Supplies are Severely Lacking

### Braille Duplicating Machine Commissioned by the Royal National Institute for the Blind

[British Information Service, London, 10th] A Braille duplicating machine commissioned by the Royal National Institute for the Blind in England has been successfully produced. This machine has a space bar and six keys, each controlling a chisel. It is powered by electricity and can engrave Braille dots on both halves of a folded zinc plate. When paper is pressed tightly between the two halves of the zinc plate, Braille dots are printed on both sides, with the dots on each half "interlocking" so that the dots on one side do not interfere with the dots on the other side. It can print seventy sheets per minute. The Technical Research Committee of the "Royal National Institute for the Blind" has also invented a Braille drawing machine. A needle traces the image to be copied, and the same path is engraved as raised dots on the zinc plate. The shape and size of the dots vary, and they are engraved by a magnetic coil and current driving a mold.

### Yenching Library Fundraising Campaign; Alumni of Shanghai University from Various Places Express Support; New Women's Dormitory to Begin Construction Within Days

### Jiangsu Province's Treasury Is Tight; Difficulties in Participating in the National Games

[Zhenjiang News] The 7th National Games are scheduled to be held in Shanghai on May 5th, and sports events in various provinces and cities are also being actively prepared. Our reporter made a special visit to relevant agencies in Jiangsu Province. According to sources, the provincial sports field in this province was thoroughly destroyed by the enemy during the occupation, almost becoming a ruin.

### Price Review Committee to Be Established Soon; To Proceed with Purchasing Export Materials; Representatives from Four Units of the Transportation Control Commission Have Been Designated

In order to promote the export of materials, the Transportation Control Commission (TCC) formulated a plan, which was discussed by the National Economic Council and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It has now entered the implementation stage. All purchasing matters will be handled by the Price Review Committee for Purchasing Export Materials, which will be jointly organized by the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture, the Four Joint Offices, the Central Bank, the Central Trust of China (CTC), and the TCC, with each agency sending one representative. The TCC will preside over the committee, and the CTC and TCC will jointly be responsible for convening meetings. Representatives from the Four Joint Offices, the Central Bank, the CTC, and the TCC have been designated. The representative from the Four Joint Offices is Diao Minren, Deputy Director of the Four Joint Offices Branch; the representative from the Central Bank is Shao Zenghua, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau; the representative from the CTC is He Molin, Deputy Director; and the representative from the TCC is Chen Junren, Director of the Export Promotion Division. The committee will be formally established and begin purchasing once representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Ministry of Agriculture are designated. The purchase prices will be determined by the review committee. The CTC will only be responsible for executing the purchase, receiving payments, and making payments. The Ministry of Audit will send a representative to attend the meetings due to the national treasury payment relationship to audit the payment accounts.

According to the person in charge of the TCC: In order to strengthen exports in the future, purchasing and foreign exchange adjustment measures will be implemented simultaneously. When the foreign exchange rate cannot promote the export of materials under certain conditions at certain times, the purchasing method will be adopted to maintain the principle of foreign and domestic prices. The purchase price will be determined based on domestic and foreign market conditions. If exporters of export materials can export on their own, they will not be forced to sell to the government. If they cannot export on their own, they can apply for government purchase. After the purchase, the exporters will still be entrusted to handle the sales, and a reasonable handling fee will be given. After obtaining a foreign letter of credit on the export date, they can settle the exchange with the CTC, and the CTC will pay the national currency at the current exchange rate. It can be seen that this measure is not a unified purchase and sales, but is entirely for supporting exporters and promoting exports. The exporter's funds will not be frozen as in the past, and they will be able to obtain sufficient capital for use. This method has been effectively implemented by the government, and domestic and foreign prices can indeed be maintained. Taking tung oil as an example, at the beginning of the war, the price of American tung oil was $0.389 per pound. After the victory, it fell to $0.20. American tung oil farmers said that this was due to our dumping. In order to save the export crisis, we specifically implemented purchasing, and the American price rose from $0.20 to $0.24525. The export price after our purchase was set at $0.25 at the time. If the American price could not be sold at this price, it would not be exported. This price stabilized for a considerable period of time. After we stopped purchasing, the American price fell to $0.212. American oil farmers again requested the government to increase import taxes and raise the price to $0.30. In order to meet domestic and foreign needs, we set it at $0.24 and 1/8. In the future, we should still shift according to foreign conditions.

Regarding the adjustment of foreign exchange, the person in charge of the TCC also provided an explanation. It is said that the official exchange rate and the black market have long been decoupled. The official exchange rate is determined according to the price of export materials. When the percentage of the price of export materials to foreign prices is exceeded, the official exchange rate will be adjusted according to the percentage. After this foreign exchange adjustment, tung oil has been able to be exported. Based on $0.24 per pound, it is estimated that each dan is worth $320. Converted at an exchange rate of 195,000, it is 6 million. The current market price is only 6 million yuan.

### Rice and Flour Initially Rose Then Fell; Oil Market Encouraged, All Saw Gains

Yesterday's rice market initially rose and then fell. The opening market followed the previous day's rising trend and the impact of the sharp rise in other commodity prices, and the prices of various types of rice rose significantly. White japonica rice opened at 3.85 million, thin indica rice at 3.8 million, and Wuhu indica rice at 3.42 million, all about 250,000 higher than the previous day. However, due to tight credit in the middle of the day, holders needed cash and sought to sell, and sales of household rice were sluggish, so sales became even more sluggish, and the market fell back later. White japonica rice retreated to 3.75 million, and thin indica rice also retreated to 3.75 million, up 150,000 from the previous day. In the northern city market, white japonica rice was 3.75 million, and thin indica rice, etc., rose by about 50,000 to 100,000. The total arrivals yesterday in the eleven city markets were 8,504 shi.

Flour: The early market took the opportunity to raise prices due to the sharp rise in rice prices. Bingchuan flour was 1.48 million yuan, Lao Che flour was 1.49 million yuan, and Hongfeng, Jiancheng, etc., rose by 450,000 yuan compared to the previous day. However, as credit tightened, holders had to sell to obtain cash, and the supply became abundant for a time, so the market fell due to oversupply. In addition, the rise in rice prices turned into a fall, and confidence became even more depressed. Bingchuan closed at 1.47 million and Lao Che closed at 1.48 million, both delivered prices. Bran was weak because the factories opened more.

Miscellaneous Grains: Follow the changes in this city. The price of soybeans rose by 100,000 yuan at the opening. In the middle of the day, the Qingdao gang purchased, and the market for Hankou soybeans was more bullish. The highest price of Hankou Zha soybeans reached 1.85 million, but customer appetite did not continue, and the closing price returned to 1.8 million, still 50,000 to 100,000 higher than the previous day. The Guang gang of raw peanuts also purchased slightly, rising by more than 100,000 yuan.

Edible Oil: Initially rose and then fell slightly. At the opening, people were encouraged by the sharp rise in rice prices. In addition, the prices in Wuxi were high, so the holders had very firm thoughts. Soybean oil rushed out of 7 million at the opening. Da You and Da Tong soybean oil was 7.05 million. The closing market turned sluggish due to tight credit and small rice prices. Soybean cake initially went out of 800,000, and the closing price was only a few thousand yuan higher than the previous day.

Hong Kong Electric experienced a severe contraction, making it difficult to recover after reaching a high point. Rubber stocks continued to soar. Jardine Silk opened in the morning and quickly broke through the 1.6 million yuan barrier, approaching the 1.7 million yuan level before slightly stabilizing. The limited number of shares available was insufficient to meet demand. Paper stocks and others were further stimulated by positive news, leading to a significant increase in price.

D-grade varieties were bid up to around 85 million, while high-grade odd-lot silk was bid at 80 million. High-grade odd-lot dry silk was quoted at around 240 million.

The silk goods market was weak yesterday. Due to the decline in raw materials the previous evening, market sentiment was inevitably soft.

Fourteen stocks reached their daily limit, and many familiar stocks reached new records. Distribution of compensation materials focused stockholders on Zhabei and American Asia, further boosting those two stocks.

### Financial Administration Bureau Randomly Inspects Banks and Firms

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Financial Administration Bureau launched another large-scale inspection during the period from the end of the lunar year to the recent dramatic price fluctuations.

The inspection has now been fully reviewed, and the results show that the operations of the inspected banks and firms are generally normal. However, a small number of banks and firms have either made too many loans that cannot be recovered on time, resulting in improper cash positions, or have overdrawn or collateralized excessively, resulting in bounced checks. The Financial Administration Bureau has strictly ordered all banks and firms to rectify the situation separately. It is reported that all banks and firms have complied with the orders.

### Floating Capital from Outside Flows into the Market, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Rise Again and Again

Throughout the day, 21-count Eagle Horse, despite being boosted by platform traders, reached a new peak of 96 million. However, due to continued tight credit, floating sellers took profits, and it eventually closed at 93 million. Warehouse receipts were at 91 million, down 2 million. 16-count coarse yarn continued to rise by 2-3 million, driven by continued buying from weaving manufacturers. 20-count yarn and 32-count, as well as other coarse and fine yarns, saw increases and decreases of 100,000 to 3 million.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market initially saw a stable sentiment due to news of strengthened US aid. Many floating sellers booked profits, and the market briefly declined. However, it was then reported that floating capital from North China had gathered in Shanghai and flowed into the cotton cloth market. Merchants from Hankou, Guangdong, Tianjin, and Shanxi competed to buy aggressively, and industry insiders also made significant purchases. Additionally, scattered retail investors joined the rally, and buying sentiment spread, causing prices to continue jumping to new highs. In the end, 12-pound Dragon Head and other fine cloths reached new highs, rising by 150,000 to 170,000 yuan. Other fabrics such as serge, straight tribute silk, bleached cloth, colored cloth, shirting, and pongee also rose, ranging from 120,000 to 340,000 yuan, and the market atmosphere was very firm.

It is also reported that the recent surge in cotton cloth prices is entirely due to the actions of floating capital from outside. However, local sales are mediocre, and business at cloth shops is not very lively. Actual sales in other regions remain sluggish, and the market is in a precarious situation. Dyeing factories also have limited sales volume and are making minimal purchases. If prices continue to rise unabated, the public may face difficulties in obtaining clothing.

Cigarettes Rise Again

Yesterday's cigarette market saw prices rise further as manufacturers were expected to adjust prices again due to higher raw material costs resulting from the rise in the US dollar exchange rate. Concerns about delayed deliveries also fueled positive sentiment and strengthened buying interest. The prices of various cigarettes continued to rise. Finally, ten packs of British Old Knife cigarettes rose by 4 million and 4.5 million yuan respectively compared to the previous day. Other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also rose uniformly by 10,000 to 340,000 yuan. Fifty packs of Cadillac cigarettes rose to 425,000 yuan, and 3-5 brand rose to 360,000 yuan, an increase of 67,000 and 52,000 respectively.

Soap Prices Soar

The daily necessities soap market was stable initially, but was affected by the rise in the cigarette market, leading to a recovery in sentiment. Large buyers actively purchased, and industry insiders also actively covered their positions. Fueled by joint purchases from the Yue-er gang and other groups, the market saw a flurry of buying activity, and prices soared. As a result, Gu Ben and Arrow soaps rose again by 280,000 and 310,000 yuan respectively. In addition, Hsiang Mao, Kwong Wah, Mei Li, etc., also rose by varying amounts of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.

### The Dynamics of Social Culture

— Traditional First

Social and Cultural Dynamic

P.A. Sorokin, American Book Co. Vol. I-III 1937 Vol. IV 1941

I often wonder why, no matter what we Chinese do, we can't seem to do it well. Any good system, good plan, or good material will gradually deteriorate, and become unimaginably bad. The current political corruption, economic poverty, social decadence, educational bankruptcy... what are the reasons for all this? Some blame the greed and incompetence of certain individuals, while others blame the warmongering of certain individuals, but I believe that neither of these is the case. In my opinion, the current chaos in China is a natural phenomenon resulting from the exchange of Eastern and Western cultures. There is a Western saying, "Old wine in new bottles." I believe that China's current situation is "New bottles containing old wine." Don't be fooled by the beautiful bottles of Three-Star Brandy, inside is aged Shaoxing Huadiao wine. Therefore, in politics, economics, society, and education, whether it be organizational structures, personnel management, or plans and programs, they are all transplanted from Western culture. However, our lifestyle, attitude towards life, and worldly wisdom are all still within the scope of the Chinese cultural tradition. Therefore, I believe that the solution to China's problems lies in the process of cultural exchange between East and West.

Sorokin is a scholar who seeks a way out for Western culture. His works can be used as a reference for our study of cultural exchange between East and West. I previously introduced his book "The Crisis of Our Age" in this journal, which was highly valued by the general public. His other works include "Contemporary Sociological Theories" (translated by Huang Wenshan, Commercial Press) and "Social and Cultural Dynamics" (translated by Zhong Zhaolin, World Press). The author's erudition is truly astonishing. The literature he cites includes Russian, French, German, and Italian sources, not to mention English and American ones. The book to be studied in this article includes four volumes:

Volume 1: On the Changes in Artistic Forms, 770 pages

Volume 2: On the Changes in Philosophy, Ethics, and Law, 727 pages

Volume 3: On the Changes in Social Relations, War, and Revolution, 636 pages

Volume 4: On the Fundamental Problems, Principles, and Methods of Social Dynamics, 804 pages

The author says that his social thought was originally influenced by the trends of thought in the early 20th century. He believed in social progress, revolution, socialism and democracy, and scientific positivism. He says: "For better or for worse, I have fought for these values; therefore, I have also paid a considerable price. I hope for peaceful progress and not war; I hope for bloodless social reform and not bloody revolution; I hope for a more noble humanism and not collective suicide; I hope for better democracy and not oligarchical dictatorship; I hope for scientific improvement and not false propaganda; I hope for the multifaceted improvement of mankind and not a return to barbarism. But the First World War gave this concept the first ruthless blow. The Soviet Revolution was the second big blow. If someone in 1913 had made an affirmative prediction of even the smallest part of what is happening now, he would have been immediately regarded as a madman at the time. But many, many things that seemed absolutely impossible continue to happen."

What is the reason for this? Due to what cause? The author began to wander, and then searched for materials to find the root. Finally, in the tide of world culture, he found a clue? This book is the crystallization of his years of exploration. The first question he wants to solve is "Is the flow of culture circular and repetitive, or is it infinitely creative?" His answer is: First, the dynamic force of culture is a creative repetitive style. The process of historical culture does not always progress in a straight line, and there are often novel changes. However, in these changes, there is still a repetition of old components, but they are repeated in many small units more successfully. Second, he believes that the development process of various cultures has a limit. That is to say, a certain culture has a period of time in which it moves in a certain direction without any significant change, but when it reaches its limit, it will immediately flow downstream and move in another new direction. (He calls this the "principle of limits," see Chapter 14 of Volume 4). Third, the reason for this change is not necessarily due to external causes, but because its internal forces have reached a stage where change is inevitable. (He calls this the "principle of internal cause," see Chapter 12 of Volume 4).

He believes that various cultures always revert to one of the three forms: (a) Ideational, (b) Idealistic, and (c) Sensate. In the Ideational cultural form, people transcend experience, pursue spiritual values, and practice self-control. In the Sensate cultural form, people indulge in desires and seek material enjoyment. The Idealistic cultural form takes the middle path between the two, combining emotion and reason. He points out that Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism belong to the Ideational type of culture; Epicurus, Caesar, Lenin, and modern Western culture belong to the Sensate type; and Confucius' doctrine of the mean belongs to the Idealistic type.

The author's research method combines the method of logical meaning and the method of causal function, that is, the combined use of induction and deduction. He says: "Purely collecting facts without thought cannot lead to meaningful conclusions; purely logical reasoning without facts will inevitably lead to a feeling of emptiness and unreality." The theory stated above is, on the one hand, a hypothesis proposed by the author based on facts, and on the other hand, he has confirmed this hypothesis from many cultural histories. Therefore, this theory is not a fanciful creation but has its factual basis.

Therefore, in the first volume of this book, the author made a systematic and comprehensive study of Western painting, sculpture, music, architecture, and literature from the primitive era, through Greece, Rome, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance, all the way to the modern era. He statistically analyzed the works of each era to see their development trends. The second volume is divided into two parts: the first part is the study of the development of various knowledge systems in various eras, which is the so-called "sociology of knowledge." He traces the evolution of idealism and materialism; the evolution of eternalism and temporalism; the evolution of realism and nominalism; the evolution of determinism and indeterminism; the evolution of all physical, biological, and other scientific theories; and the evolution of categories such as causality, time and space, and number. He uses detailed numerical figures to explain the waxing and waning of various schools of thought over the years. The second part is the study of the changes in ethics and law in various eras. He also found the same route in it. They are all either wavy reversions in the Sensate, Ideational, and Idealistic cultural types. The third volume is divided into four parts: (1) the form and changes of social relations, including various political, economic, religious, and social groups and organizations; (2) the changes in the history of war between various groups; (3) internal disturbances and collapses within various group organizations; (4) the relationship between personality types and social types.

Based on the results of his research on the development of Western culture in various aspects, he believes that Western culture was in the Ideational stage in the Middle Ages, and has entered the Sensate stage in modern times. Currently, it is the period when Sensate culture has developed to the point of near decline. The author has the following conclusions regarding the future development trends of Western culture:

(1) Material values ​​will be more relative and fragmented. In the future, truth and falsehood, right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, positive and negative will all be confused. There will be a state of anarchy in psychology, morality, society, and aesthetics.

(2) Everything is progressing, but it is the progress of destruction, not the progress of construction. Whether it is human beings or all values, they are regarded as physical and chemical effects, reflective effects, economic effects, or mechanical effects. This universe is just a world of atoms and electrons.

(3) The so-called public opinion and conscience will disappear. Everything will be full of conflicting opinions.

(4) Force and fraud have become the means to obtain everything. As a result, there is only universal war, revolution, rebellion, and disturbance. People fight with people, and countries fight with countries.

(5) Freedom has become the mantra of oppressors.

(6) The government is becoming increasingly corrupt, deceptive, and tyrannical, using guns instead of bread; death instead of freedom; violence instead of law; and destruction instead of construction.

(7) The family is no longer a sacred union between husband and wife, but has become a hostel for the union of men and women. Divorce will gradually increase.

(8) Vitality and creativity will continue to decline. There will be no more Newtons, Darwins, or Beethovens, but some mediocre thinkers, film manufacturers, and music brokers.

(9) Life safety will be threatened, and suicide, mental illness, and crime will increase. Everyone will feel depressed.

(10) The general public will be divided into two factions: one faction will be the hedonists who "drink today and be drunk today"; the other faction will be hermits who practice asceticism and do not seek fame or fortune.

The future trend is that Sensate culture will age and pass away, while Idealistic or Ideational culture will generate new vitality and unleash new creativity, forming a new spiritual culture.

The current level of chaos in China seems to be beyond repair. China is undergoing tremendous changes. This is a metamorphosis. All corrupt, stubborn, violent, and crazy elements will be shed, and a new life, a new form of culture with its new creativity, is about to come.

### The Art of Living

— Zhu Fang

"Kaicheng Youth Series" by Cao Fu

The Russian blind poet Eroshchenko said: "What we sow in spring, we can reap at harvest time. All the year's good fortune depends on our spring work, and the roots of famine, lack, and all other misfortunes of a country also grow in spring." Youth is truly like the spring of life, so we too should sow good seeds during our youth.

Moreover, youth is the easiest time to feel depressed, troubled, and sad. To remedy these problems and sow good seeds; this is the cultivation of youth.

The book "The Art of Living" discusses many problems of youth cultivation, and there are two points in it that deserve our attention: First, it does not emphasize the external refinement of youth. Second, it points youths in broad directions, not just treating the head when it hurts or the foot when it hurts.

This book has eleven articles. The first article, "The Confession of an Idealist," is where the author introduces his own life philosophy. In the second article, "Life and Interest," the author proposes three conditions to guide young people: (1) Persistence - he quotes Liang Rengong's words: "If doing something does not produce results that are related to interest, then this thing can be the subject of interest."

(2) Comprehensiveness - he says: An interest that rejects other equally good or better interests is not a good interest. Conversely, an interest that can induce other equally good or better interests is a good interest. (3) Rationality - he believes that there must be thought and ideals in interest. Some interests, such as gambling and drinking, cannot withstand thinking, so they cannot be interests, at most only low-level interests. The third article is "Planning Life." He quotes the four sentences of the Song Dynasty Confucian Zhang Zai as the best explanation of the highest level of life plan: "Establish a heart for the world, plead for the lives of the people, continue the unique learning for past sages, and create peace for all ages." That is to say, the highest level of life plan is to combine personal plans with the mission of history and the requirements of the times.

The following four articles are "Work", "Play", "Reading", and "Love". Perhaps these are the four issues that young people are most concerned about. The last one is "Anti-Cynicism", "Hero and Hero Worship", "Group and Self", in addition to two prefaces, which are also beneficial to the cultivation of young people. Especially the one on what young people should cultivate.

In short, this is a healthy book on the cultivation of youth.

### Common Sense of English Word Origins

— Wen Ni

Published by Liu Junwei, Zhonghua Book Company

Studying language is the most boring, it is not more vivid and practical than other sciences. The reason is that words are dead, and can only represent a symbol of a language oath, no wonder it is boring.

Learning English is often a pain for readers, the differences between China and foreign countries are one thing, the biggest reason lies in single words, and single words are extremely abstract, making it difficult to remember. It is said that there are more than 100,000 British single words, although it is not necessary to remember them all, it is still a painful thing. Often, scholars give up halfway. In fact, English single words, in addition to their own Celtic language, also contain Latin, Greek and other language families, so they are extremely complex; coupled with the derivation of prefixes and suffixes, they become even more complex. To study English and understand its word origins is very necessary, as it is said in the introduction of the book, "..., according to , you can know its , divide and combine, and have a clear view at a glance. By analogy, you can remember what you already know and extend it to what you don't know, ...", and it is also said in the preface: "The function of word origins is not only to detail the source of a word and its changes when it is linked to other words, but also to further explain its structure and the progress of its script ..."

There are still few books on foreign language origins in our country. This book describes four parts:

(1) Outline of single-word composition: A very concise statement of the types and structures of single words is made, with examples given.

(2) The phenomenon of prefix combination.

(3) The phenomenon of suffix combination.

(4) Word root plate. The above three parts make simple explanations of each prefix, suffix, and root, and attach sufficient examples to show its effect, and the attached examples are also very common and practical. Although it is only a booklet of more than one hundred and fifty pages, it is a good reference book for those who study English, and it is also suitable as leisure reading during the winter vacation. I would like to introduce it for enthusiasts.

### Talking About "Arch of Triumph"

— Shi Jimei

Author: Remarque Translator: Zhu Wen Publisher: Cultural Life Publishing House

A German refugee meets a heartbroken woman on a long street near the Seine River and the Alma Bridge in the black night of November in Paris. This is how the story of "Arch of Triumph" begins:

Like countless anti-Nazi exiles, Ravic has no real name, no passport, and no ID. Everything seems "illegal". He is the "backstage doctor" of a famous Parisian doctor, a "ghost surgeon" who performs operations. Of course, such a profession is secret. He lives in a "tomb" like hotel, with no so-called "home." A loner's loneliness is naturally easily dispelled in Paris. Love a woman casually, discard her casually. It doesn't matter. Ravic spends his days like this, indifferently, in exile in a foreign country. His joys and sorrows, happiness and imprisonment, cries and laughs ... it doesn't matter; but - Joan Madou, the strange woman who met by chance at the Alma Bridge, that woman, one person among the countless humans, her face, one face among countless faces, her eyes, one pair among millions of eyes ... it wasn't love at first sight. But Ravic tried to forget her several times, but couldn't forget her. This lovely and hateful gypsy-type woman, he didn't fall in love with her at first sight, but she broke into his life, even into his very existence. Ravic privately didn't want to admit it, but couldn't deny it.

Without an ID, you have nothing. But now he has Joan Madou: he takes care of her man's funeral, he finds her a job singing in a nightclub, he helps her a lot. But Joan needs more from him. She wants a clean little apartment, a clean little refuge, the warmth that belongs to two people. But he can't, he has no reason to rent an apartment, nor can he marry the woman he loves, because he has no ID. So they can only leave Paris for a short time and go to Antibes for a few days. The turquoise bay of Antibes and the golden sun add beauty to the days. These few days are full of light and love, but all this happiness has no roots. Happiness in the clouds, a good dream in the clouds, back to Paris, the dream also wakes up.

Later, Germany occupied Czechoslovakia, shouldn't the gunpowder smell in Paris be stronger? But Paris is still Paris, corruption and prosperity, everything is as before, the same as when he left, only one thing is different: - Joan Madou left the nightclub and lived with a movie actor. Only this one thing is different from before, a very small thing, but how different it is.

Like every estranged lover, between them, after many explanations, forgiveness, questioning, tolerance ... love and quarrel, quarrel and love, bad and good, good and bad, finally they are still connected. That is the most difficult thread to break since ancient times, love.

Many refugees are looking for other ways out, many friends have left Paris, because war is about to happen, but Ravic doesn't consider other plans. Now, he has avenged himself, the person he hated has died at his own hands, why doesn't he leave? Now, even the singing and dancing in Paris has become tense, Ravic, a single German refugee, what is he reluctant to give up?

One night, Ravic received a phone call from Joan, she begged him to come quickly, she needed him, but Ravic hung up the phone. Then, an unknown young man walked into his door, the movie actor, the one living with Joan, this person brought bad and terrible news: Joan was injured, he shot her himself, out of jealousy.

Ravic looked at his own hands, his hands, that had performed thousands of operations, saved countless lives, but now had become powerless. His hands, that had killed the person he hated the most, couldn't save the person he loved the most. - The person he loved the most, in the last moments of her life, she told him that she loved him, and he told her that he loved her, and then Joan died like that, although she was not willing to die.

Ravic was not sad, many dangers flashed before his eyes, faces and past events, and then the last unchanging face. The golden sunlight was moving, moving, these were the last few hours of his freedom, because France and Germany had declared war.

The truck passed through the Arc de Triomphe, Ravic and a large group of people were squeezed inside, he was sent from this "tomb" to another, worse "tomb" - a concentration camp, at that time, there were no lights everywhere, only pitch black. ...

The story ends like this, the endless book gives people a kind of pity, a kind of anger, a kind of horror, and a kind of thirst and expectation for freedom and light; this emotion, this idea, is in the hearts of thousands of readers, but few people can say it concretely. So many emotions, so many tastes of life, so many experiences of life, so much pain and joy of life, so much love, passionate love, love to the point of barbarism, so much hate, deep hate, hate to the point of madness; ... these burning traces, the reality of blood and tears, the poetry of this world, are not the empty and ethereal legends and dramas that come out of nowhere; this is the story of people, and it is also the story of the times, the story of the world; this is the elegy of people, and it is also the elegy of the times, the elegy of the world; because what is described here is not only the black night of mankind, but also the black night of the times, the black night of the world. After reading "Arc de Triomphe", we should not only cry for the characters in the story, but also shed tears for this world, this era.

There seems to be no need to introduce the author of this book again. When Remarque is mentioned, thousands of readers immediately think of "All Quiet on the Western Front", which was a recognized epoch-making masterpiece after the First World War. In the First World War, Remarque brought the most brilliant pearl to the world literary scene. The European and American critics unanimously believe that this "Arc de Triomphe" surpasses any of the author's past works, and has been filmed by the American film industry.

After the Nazis came to power, Remarque fled Germany and lived in the United States. This book was written in the United States, published in the United States, and translated in the United States. According to the records of the American Book Club, it has sold 20 million copies. In addition to this book and "All Quiet on the Western Front", the author also has "The Road Back", "Flotsan", and "Three Comrades", etc.; Cultural Life Publishing House has planned to publish "The Complete Works of Remarque", translated by Zhu Wen, the translator of this book. Another masterpiece of the author, "Floating Lotus" (Flotam), has been translated and will be printed soon.

### Philosophy of Mud

— Jing Wen

In the beginning, when God created man, it is said that the raw material used was mud. The mud comes from the earth, and the earth is the mother of mankind, and man's final destination is still to be thrown into the arms of this mother, and still turn into mud. Taking people's lives as an example, tracing back to the source, which one can leave the relationship with the earth. I remember when I was sick in a church hospital run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church in a certain year, I saw a book on health and hygiene. The book advocates that people should eat more vegetables and less fish and meat, because pigs, sheep, cattle and horses mostly grow by eating grass. It is neither economical nor hygienic for people to use grass to feed pigs and sheep and then eat their meat. I am still very grateful for this simple truth, and I feel more and more the profound meaning of God's creation of man with mud. Even if this is a myth, it is quite interesting.

But perhaps some people think that mud is an unclean thing, and it would be too sloppy for God to use it to create man. For example, Jia Baoyu in "Dream of the Red Chamber" once disliked men for being made of rotten mud, so they were unclean, and only women were made of clear water. Jia Baoyu naturally didn't know the story of God creating man. In fact, women are just a part of flesh and blood separated from men, and are also made of mud in essence. In my opinion, the myth of mud creating man has another profound meaning.

First, man comes from the earth, and finally returns to the earth, which shows the causal relationship of man, telling people not to forget the origin in the secular life. Not to mention that wealth and fame are like floating clouds, even in the process of life, everything in the undertaking should leave some leeway when it is time to stop, for one's own life, for future generations, for the society and country entrusted to my strange life. A person should fulfill his due responsibility, but between self and altruism, there should still be some leeway.

This opinion is not nihilism or escapism. If you can calmly observe the world, you will definitely be surprised and even sigh at the busy situation of the common people. What are those crowds on the road hurrying about? Is it for survival? However, not everyone is busy for life, I am afraid half of them are busy with nothing. Because on the asphalt road where there is not a single blade of green grass, it is difficult to believe that there is any real meaning of life.

The conditions of life cannot be separated from the basic conditions of food production. However, according to experts, China needs 380 million agricultural laborers to support the remaining 70 million people. Conversely, in the developed United States, only 32 million agricultural laborers are needed to supply food for 180 million people. Therefore, in theory, those who are truly busy with life should be the 380 million Chinese villagers rather than the 70 million city dwellers. But the actual situation seems to be the opposite. The rural areas in the interior are already sparsely populated, and there is a deep feeling of insufficient labor, while in cities like Shanghai, there is a surplus of labor.

The result of the surplus of urban labor is naturally unavoidable competition for survival. Thus, those who are superior engage in speculation, and those who are inferior engage in scalping, and everyone euphemistically calls it survival. However, what kind of survival are they seeking? They are only using various disguised fraudulent means to try to pour the money in your pocket into his pocket. Not only is there no production to speak of, it is really a great waste of manpower.

However, the problem is not limited to this. Those big and small scalpers actually pay attention to that so-called "entrepreneurial spirit." Not only are they not sloppy about the "money in and out," but they are also full of a terrible "competition" spirit towards people and things. Whether it is rushing onto a streetcar or competing to run in the market, it has reached the point where it is either you or me. Once I heard a ticket seller on a streetcar say to a passenger who was desperately rushing onto the car: "Don't rush so hard regardless of life and death. It doesn't matter if you wait a while. You will have more time if you can live twenty-four hours longer." However, now many people seem to have no time to consider their future twenty-four hours for the sake of the immediate competition.

I am not pessimistic, but the day of a seven-foot paulownia coffin and a cup of yellow earth will eventually come to everyone. People are just passing travelers in this world. It is naturally worthy of everyone to try to do something to benefit the people. Even if it is just for one's own sake, it cannot be said to be a sin. However, in the process of life, if you can often bring a few philosophical perspectives, then whether it is for yourself or for others, even if it is useless, it will never be harmful.

The so-called philosophy here does not have any profound principles, as long as you have the opportunity to go to the countryside to hold a handful of mud and play with it, it is all in it.

### Treatise on Dislike for Noise

— Ping Zhai

When I was young, I read an article by Henry Van Dyke, titled "Silence." He had a famous saying: In this age, there is too much noise, we simply cannot "hear" our own thoughts anymore.

The "this age" that Van Dyke refers to is the end of the nineteenth century, which was a peaceful and prosperous world, and the business world was especially smooth and prosperous like never before. Advertising techniques also began to be used on a large scale, with posters and slogans everywhere. Thus, scholars who were accustomed to tranquility, such as Van Dyke, felt that the invisible high wall around him had been broken through by these new "civilizations," and issued a desperate appeal. However, the appeal was also in vain. Human ears are the most uncontrollable organs: we can close our eyes to things we don't want to see; but we cannot close our ears to sounds we don't want to hear. Comparing the past and the present, Van Dyke was still lucky to scare all the customers away and keep his shop. At least in his era, there was one kind of "civilization" that was not as powerful, universal, and persistent as it is now.

This one kind of "civilization" is the radio.

A few years ago, I worked in a high-rise building, and the office was along the road. Directly across the road was a newly opened second- or third-rate department store. The department store did not have a radio, but it installed a loudspeaker at the door, and every day from morning it roared with its only three records, until late at night. A friend once asked me: "Why do I always hear 'Hanging Heads on High Poles' every time I call you?" In addition to a bitter smile, I had to tell him that the boss across the street regarded the God of Wealth Festival as a terrible star.

Jin Shaoshan's Famen Temple may not be bad - although I believe his "airs" are definitely not as good as Hao Chouchen. But to play it so many times every day, I am afraid that even Jin Shaoshan himself would have to cry for mercy? Besides, it is a bit too humorous to use "Hanging Heads on High Poles" as a means of attracting customers!

This is of course just an extreme example. However, the trend of shops using radios to attract audiences has not changed to this day. Every time I walk down a road, in addition to the popping sounds of car horns rising and falling, there is this large area of ​​endless broadcast warfare - one shop is playing resonant Peking Opera, the next shop is playing sharp songs, and across the street may be a sad Shaoxing opera. Walking on the road already causes a headache, how dare you even go to those noisy places of origin - the shops - to buy things?

On careful thought, the reason why shops must have radios, and must turn them on so loud, may be a clever way for the shop assistants to be lazy. Aren't they free from work if they have people with especially strong hearts blocking the door for those who specialize in listening to the radio?

I don't want to criticize the quality of radio programs, and I certainly don't want to underestimate the contribution of radio. For example, hearing the broadcast of Du Shouyi's charity performance last year made me feel grateful for the radio. (But I still don't understand why no one recorded that charity performance; haven't they heard the Toscanini records from NBC?) What I want to point out is that everyone has different interests. Suppose I am a person who never wants to listen to Yue opera, and a certain shop just happens to play Yue opera programs all day long, then I will naturally never go into this shop. If the purpose of the shop was originally to attract customers, and I was originally prepared to go to this shop to buy things, but the transaction was not completed because of the radio, wouldn't it be a pity - it also costs a little electricity to turn on the radio. I think it is better to save this electricity and install more bright neon lights - it at least decorates some of the night scenes of this city.

### Elementary School Teacher

— Bao Zhongqi

Schools are divided into large, medium, and small, so the names of those who hold the teaching whip are also different: professor, teacher, and instructor. Because teaching is the most difficult career, some people say: universities "teach sorrow," middle schools "teach resentment," and elementary schools "teach death." Regardless of whether it is sarcasm, the fact that elementary school teachers deserve sympathy is undeniable.

Perhaps it was because my enlightenment teacher in elementary school was particularly poor that I always remembered him. Tall and thin, he had been mixed in with innocent children for decades, giving him a deep understanding of children's psychology, but also bringing him gradually white hair and an even more difficult life. After being separated from him for ten years, these ten years of war and turmoil, I learned from my sister that he was still teaching at his alma mater. According to my sister, Teacher Zhang is even thinner and has gray hair. Maybe this is the result of his ten years! He said that he was very happy to see me learning to write articles in the newspaper. His attention made me feel a sincere sense of guilt, because in the past few years, I had never taken the time to visit him once.

Because of this, I feel even more that elementary school teachers, in addition to not having any so-called material enjoyment, they also do not get any spiritual comfort. After elementary school students graduate and go to middle school and university, they have already put their elementary school teachers out of their minds and forgotten them completely. However, how uncomfortable is our teacher?

I often think to myself, there are so many students graduating every year, he probably won't recognize me! However, facts have proven my idea to be wrong: it was after our principal Zhu Shaoping was martyred in Manila, I wrote a short article in the newspaper to commemorate him. Although I used a pen name, he saw his student in the words. In a certain opportunity, he inquired about my sister and my recent situation. Obviously, he had not forgotten us children, just like a kind mother, she was watching the children she had nurtured!

Like the roots of an old tree, the flourishing branches and leaves are due to the supply of nutrients from the old roots, so that they can be verdant and full of eyes; no matter how high a towering building is, how can it stand without the support of the underground foundation?

I wrote this short article to pay tribute to my elementary school teacher and to wish him good health!

### Traces of Flying Saucers

— Sun He

Last summer, there was a long-standing fuss about flying saucers. They were discovered all over the world, and newspapers spread the news, causing unfounded fears and superstitious rumors. A friend of mine studying at Harvard University recently sent a letter reporting the truth, revealing that flying saucers are not some secret weapon, but simply this: The original letter is excerpted as follows:

Brother ××: Having not seen domestic newspapers for a long time, I eagerly sought to read them. Yesterday, I obtained a few copies from Mrs. Bi. Although they were old news, I found reports mentioning "the mystery of flying saucers, which has not yet been revealed." Here, it is no longer a mystery. Although newspapers have not sensationalized it or treated it as important news, they have revealed some details. If the mystery truly remains unsolved in China, I am willing to explain it in detail. It is merely a trick played by V2 rockets. When the rocket is launched from the ground (New Mexico), a precisely calculated automatic device explodes at an altitude of about one hundred miles in the sky. The steel fragments of the warhead then fly upwards at a speed of 25,000 miles per hour. During this upward flight, these fragments are attracted back to Earth by gravity, causing them to orbit irregularly, like scattered flowers shimmering in the sunlight, circular like saucers, until the inward pull of gravity causes them to fall back to Earth. This is because the outward force of motion gradually weakens against the inward pull of gravity.

The purpose of this experiment is to measure the density and temperature of the air in the upper atmosphere, to understand the true nature of the ionosphere, and to solve certain electrical problems and problems related to throwing objects beyond the Earth's gravitational pull. The issue that causes people in our country to be startled is nothing more than this. In addition to our university, the experiment is also being conducted at the California Institute of Technology and Johns Hopkins University, among others. (Omitted below)

### Casual Impressions

— Bai Chu

Generally speaking, Chinese people do not pay much attention to impressions. We dare not casually criticize a new friend; partly because we are afraid that words spoken might spread and cause trouble, but mainly because we "have no basis for judgment." When we say someone is good or bad, we are merely expressing, based on accumulated observations up to now, our assessment of them—there is no element of impression in this, nor does it mean they are permanently good or bad. Isn't there a popular saying in society, "The coffin lid seals the final judgment"? This illustrates that we dare not draw conclusions until that person has passed away.

Why don't we value impressions? Why must we wait until the "coffin is sealed" before "drawing a conclusion"? This involves the issue of "face." Chinese people value face. If someone wants to get to know you, even if they are so poor they owe their landlord three months' rent, they will still get a haircut, take a bath, borrow a Western suit, and present themselves as a young master. Even if they are the most despicable and shameless rogue, they will pretend to be refined and gentle, engaging in affected conversation for a while. If you were to form a good impression based on this alone, and think they are a young master or gentleman, wouldn't that be a joke! Everyone understands this principle, so there is a tacit understanding: no one criticizes based on impression. Because impressions are unreliable, to make an accurate judgment, one must wait until the coffin is sealed and there is no room for change, otherwise, you might just say they are a human being, but their fox tail is already wagging behind them. Without a demon-revealing mirror, how would you know what kind of creature they transformed from?

However, the situation is very different in foreign countries. "First impression" is almost a common term and is taken very seriously. If this "first impression" is good, it is like being registered with the government; you are forever considered a good person. Even if you make a mistake occasionally, it is seen as understandable and forgiven. Conversely, if you give someone a very bad first impression, they will definitely "look at you differently" afterward. Even if you perform well, it will be considered an unexpected "miracle"!

One is "the coffin lid seals the final judgment," the other is "first impression." This shows the difference in attitudes toward people between Chinese and foreigners.

### Miscellaneous Discussions from the Arts Pavilion

— Shi Shufan

Mourning Mr. He Yangling's Past in Lake Pavilion Reminiscences

Knowing this gathering is transient again, I bear to say the He Lake grass is desolate, His career vanished like smoke, my emotions heavy, The Lake Pavilion wine scattered, the moon hazy! Two or three figures are silent paintings, In June, frost flew like last night, Raising my eyes, White Gate truly causes heartache, A coffin leaving regrets to depth.

Mourning Mr. Yangling Again

Stars flow at the corner of the roof, ink flows in traces, Just three months ago, we discussed White Gate, Heartbreaking for the country on this night, Thinking about it, what is there to say about fate? Once supported the precarious situation with streamlined troops, Always cherishing small loyalties, you were revered in your seat. Opening a government for eight years was originally a dream, Only leaving behind a reputation for integrity at the coffin lid.

Hungrily swallowing wheat cakes, going out without a carriage, Proclamations issued overnight, sitting in a cold office, Not necessarily ill-fated for resigning from office, Pitiable, letting go with a whole family! My life will see荒夢 again, Wild sacrifices fly in disorder, with a rustling sound. The remaining elegance is now exhausted, Who else will bring plum blossoms to the ancient temple tomb?

New Year's Eve of Yi Hai

The ultimate joy and sorrow fill tonight, The atmosphere of war burns red, flickering candle shadows, Changing the year in a chaotic world is ultimately the same, Sheltering guests in a high building is also desolate. Speechless, I can only stop the pain of all directions, Unable to bear the worry of the arrogance of the generals! Sitting until the sun follows the spring dreams, The emperor's black clothes are wet, and the roof tiles are frosted.

Matches by Wang Baili

In Japan, matches are called "rin sun," while in our country they are called "yang huo," or "zi lai huo." In Wenzhou, they are even called "zi lai huo zhu." They are made by dipping thin wooden sticks in flammable substances such as phosphorus and sulfur, and generating fire through chemical action by friction. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Austrian Preschel made red-headed matches (not the red-headed ones sold on the market today); the Swede Lundstrom made black-headed matches, which were silent when struck, which are the so-called safety matches today. According to Ruan Wushan's "Tea Leisure Guest Tales," people in the capital would scrape hemp stalks into small pieces, coat the ends with sulfur, and call them "qu deng" (fire-getters). People in Hangzhou would make them from pine wood, calling them "fa zhu" (fire sticks). According to historical records, during the sixth year of Zhou Jiande, poor consorts of Qi made a living by making "fa zhu." Furthermore, the "Qing Yi Lu" says, "At night, suffering from the slowness of lighting fire sticks, they would split fir wood and dye it with sulfur, which would ignite upon contact with fire, calling it 'yin er' (igniter)." All of these are precursors to today's matches. Is the Wenzhou people's term "zi lai huo zhu" perhaps a remnant of "huang zhu" (sulfur sticks)?

### Unfettered Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 12: Chance Encounters (94)

Qi Wan saw that Dao Yun was speaking like he was on a stage, spouting a great philosophy. Even though he used himself as an example, his words were implicitly correct, and she was very moved. She immediately blurted out, "Mr. Liu, if you were unlucky in love, would you also adopt this attitude?" Dao Yun said, "I have experienced countless failures in love. I believe love is sacred, and the boundaries between love and friendship must be clear. Blind love will never have good results. So whenever I encounter setbacks, I never blame heaven or others, I only examine my own faults." Qi Wan nodded and said, "With Mr. Liu's views and experience, of course you wouldn't fail!" Dao Yun said, "It was wrong for me to make such remarks in front of Miss Gu today, but I am straightforward, please forgive me, Miss Gu." Qi Wan said, "What Mr. Liu said are golden words, and I am deeply grateful. Since I came to the hospital, I have been very depressed. I feel that life is too boring, and I even resent the doctor for saving me. I wish I had died and been done with it. Since talking to Mr. Liu, I feel a different kind of feeling, not as desolate and lifeless as before. I feel that there is still a path to walk in society, and I still have to move forward." Dao Yun clapped his hands and said, "That's right, you should move forward! A little stimulation is nothing. If Miss Gu feels that it is not suitable in Beiping, you can go elsewhere. As the saying goes, 'The sea is wide for fish to leap, and the sky is high for birds to fly,' you can go anywhere, there is no need to stay in Beiping. I think with Miss Gu's talent, you will be very popular in Shanghai." Qi Wan said, "It's good to go to Shanghai, but opening a new market is also difficult. Besides, I have recently become very indifferent to the life of a dancer." Dao Yun said, "Miss Gu has a bright future, there is no reason to be passive!" Qi Wan said, "I have been in the theater for seven or eight years, and I am still in this state today, what is the point!" Dao Yun said, "Miss Gu, you need to broaden your horizons, muster your courage, and keep moving forward. Success depends on human effort. As long as you have perseverance and courage, you will succeed! If Miss Gu recognizes him and says that his family has businesses in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and he only left his field of study because he loved the life under the spotlight. His plan is to organize a huge film production company, recruit stars, and shoot a perfect film that will overwhelm the products of Shanghai and Hong Kong film companies. Finally, he talked about how Hollywood producers made fortunes, and that people in the industry would be successful in this type of business. They talked for two hours, and the more they talked, the more excited they became.

### Reader's Mailbox: High Price of Rationed Rice - Urgent Appeal from the Common People

Dear Editor: Since the New Year, prices have been fluctuating and rising wildly without end, to the despair of us common people—how are we to live? In particular, the staple food of rice, which people cannot live without, has now reached an astonishingly high price of over four million yuan. At such exorbitant prices, the poor will inevitably become starving ghosts. No wonder people are in a state of panic, and the country's future is especially precarious. Our authorities, recognizing this, have decided to distribute rationed rice to alleviate the people's difficulties, which is truly a benevolent policy. However, implementation has been too slow, ultimately leading to the peak of rice prices. If the distribution had been done quickly at the time, the price would not have risen so much. But who would have known that the agreed distribution price would be almost the same as the market price of white rice, while in fact, those who rely on rationed rice for survival are all poor people. At such a high price, the poor will be in dire straits. I am now petitioning on behalf of the common people of Shanghai, that the price of rationed rice should not exceed half the price of white rice on the black market. This is because the price of the second phase of rationed oil was set at 24,000 yuan per jin, while the black market price of oil was around 70,000 yuan per jin. If this could be done, then the black market price of rice would definitely fall. Now, with 2.4 million yuan as the agreed price for rationed rice, there is no possibility of the market price of rice falling. Although it is beautifully called rationed rice, it is actually of no benefit to the people. Furthermore, reports indicate that the food distribution authorities have stated that the price of rice for March has been set at 2.4 million yuan per dan, and there is no possibility of reducing it. If it is reduced further, there is a risk of reverse flow, which would be undesirable. However, the price of rationed sugar and oil distributed each time is more than twice as cheap as the black market price, yet we have not heard of any reverse flow phenomenon. Furthermore, it is said that the purpose of this distribution of rice is to stabilize rice prices and delay the cyclical price increases. However, the black market price of rice has recently been soaring, and it has not been curbed at all because of the distribution of rice. Isn't this because the agreed price of rationed rice is too high? It must be understood that the people are the foundation of the country, and food is the priority of the people. We small citizens must request the government authorities to quickly review and reduce the price, so as to alleviate the people's difficulties and stabilize society. I am just a humble scholar, but I am still thinking about the country and society. I believe that all the officials in the government will also prioritize the lives of the people. Your newspaper serves society and your reputation spreads throughout the country. I hope you will give this special attention and speak for the people. Respectfully submitted, Lu Zhaoqi, March 6th.
