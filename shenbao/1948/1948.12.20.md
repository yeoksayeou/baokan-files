### Sun Ke Resigns as Premier; President Urges Continued Efforts; Cabinet Formation Difficulties to be Resolved Through Consultation Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Sun Ke's cabinet formation has changed due to encountering too many difficulties. Policies and personnel matters which were nearing finalization on the evening of the 18th were again disrupted on the 19th. Since being appointed to form a cabinet, from the Legislative Yuan's approval vote on the 26th of last month until now, more than 20 days have passed, yet his new cabinet has not been formed. Sun's advocated all-party unity of top leaders cabinet has likely failed to achieve its purpose. External rumors that Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and others have agreed to join the cabinet appear to be premature. Sun, due to the difficulties in forming a cabinet, has become increasingly passive and has submitted his resignation from the premiership to the President. However, the President has personally asked Sun to withdraw his resignation and encouraged him to continue his efforts. On the morning of the 19th, the President again dispatched Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, and others to persuade him and to consult with Sun on resolving the difficult problems. The negotiations on the 19th do not seem to have yielded any concrete results. A Central Standing Committee meeting will be held after the Central Memorial Week on the 20th to discuss this matter. According to sources close to the President, if Sun Ke insists on resigning, the President may consider Zhang Qun or Zhang Zhizhong as candidates for the new Premier.

[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Authoritative sources told the United Press on the 19th that Sun Ke's efforts to organize a wartime cabinet suffered new setbacks on the morning of the 19th. If these difficulties are not resolved by the 20th, Sun may resign. Future discussions will be held on the morning of the 20th, although it is uncertain whether an agreement can be reached, senior government officials believe it is highly possible. It is said that the discussions on the morning of the 19th were stalled because Wu Tiecheng firmly refused to serve as Deputy Premier. However, Sun hopes to take a short rest after the cabinet is formed and insists on Wu joining the cabinet. According to United Press sources, the current Minister of Communications Yu Dawei may succeed He Yingqin as Minister of National Defense, while the current Minister of Overseas Affairs of the Kuomintang, Liu Wei-zhi, may succeed Chen Qitian as Minister of Industry and Commerce. Chen Lifu has already agreed to join the cabinet, serving as Minister of Interior or a non-departmental cabinet member. However, if Wu Tiecheng firmly refuses to serve as Deputy Premier, Chen may also become a candidate for Deputy Premier.

[Our Dispatch] The funds to be used for the fourth phase of US aid are approximately US$60 million. The implementation plan has been drafted by the ECA branch and submitted to the US Aid Utilization Committee for approval. This phase of US aid includes orders for grain, cotton, fertilizer, oil, and industrial equipment. Under the US aid program, grain accounts for a total of US$70 million. More than US$40 million of grain has been used in the first, second, and third phases of US aid. Therefore, the grain portion of the fourth phase of US aid may be around US$20 million. However, in view of the current situation in the country, the supply of industrial equipment is no longer an urgent priority. The ECA may transfer the industrial equipment portion to the grain portion. Therefore, the grain portion of the fourth phase of US aid may be another US$20 million.

### Martial Law to be Amended: Ministry of National Defense Submits to Executive Yuan to Complete Legislative Process, Expanding the Scope of Military Jurisdiction in Alert Areas

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Article 8 of the Martial Law is to be amended. The Ministry of National Defense, in response to actual needs, has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to forward it to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. It is understood that Article 8 of the Martial Law stipulates that during martial law, within combat zones, regarding crimes of internal rebellion, treason, offenses against public order, public endangerment, forgery of currency, valuable securities, and documents and seals, murder, offenses against freedom, robbery, piracy, intimidation, kidnapping for ransom, and destruction of property, military organs may conduct their own trials or send them to court for trial. The Ministry of National Defense believes that during this period of suppression of rebellion, traitors and bandits are lurking everywhere in the country, taking the opportunity to disrupt order, spy on military intelligence, endanger national security, and affect military operations. Although the President has announced martial law throughout the country and stipulated that county magistrates concurrently hold the position of military judge, most of the Northwest and all of the Southwest and South of the Yangtze River are alert areas. According to the provisions of the Martial Law, although county magistrates concurrently hold judicial positions, they still have no authority to try traitors and communist bandits. There are only 24 locations with special criminal tribunals. If county magistrates cannot immediately suppress the activities of traitors and bandits, they cannot be responsible for maintaining public order. To remedy this, the Ministry plans to amend Article 8 of the Martial Law to expand the scope of military jurisdiction within alert areas, so that the military law itself has the power to try traitors and communist bandits. The Ministry of National Defense will then grant this power to county magistrates concurrently holding military law positions, in order to curb banditry in the rear and strive for victory in suppressing the rebellion.

### Editorial: Will the US Intensify its Support for Japan?

On the 17th, the US State Department announced that new instructions regarding stabilizing the Japanese economy had been sent to Supreme Commander MacArthur, instructing the Japanese government to implement effective economic stabilization plans to ensure the continued economic recovery and the full utilization of US funds. Upon hearing the news, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida was overjoyed and immediately expressed his satisfaction to the Agence France-Presse reporter. The general Japanese population was also visibly pleased, inevitably becoming complacent, believing this to be a sign of a bright future for Japan. While we do not hold the base mentality of "sour grapes," we believe that the US's misguided policy of "supporting Japan to contain communism" and Japan's opportunistic attempts to please the US do not bode well for peace in the Far East in the long run. We must point out that the US is heading down a wrong path in the Far East.

In order to use "US aid" to revive its economy, Japan had already drafted a "Five-Year Economic Reconstruction Plan" in May of this year. After the plan was announced by the Economic Reconstruction Planning Conference, American public opinion immediately expressed support, and Under Secretary of the Army Draper also made a clear statement, saying, "Japan has begun economic recovery, but the task is arduous and cannot be accomplished overnight… To ensure the success of this plan, the entire Japanese nation must be even more frugal than before the war." Subsequently, in July, MacArthur instructed the Japanese government to vigorously implement eight plans: (1) Strictly conserve expenditures and increase government tax revenues to achieve a truly balanced budget as soon as possible; (2) Accelerate and strengthen the tax collection plan, ensuring swift, widespread, and forceful criminal prosecution for those who evade taxes; (3) Strictly limit loans, restricting them to projects that contribute to Japan's economic recovery; (4) Develop an effective plan to stabilize wages; (5) Strengthen and, if necessary, expand the scope of existing price control plans; (6) Improve the management of foreign trade and tighten existing foreign exchange controls, ensuring that these measures can be transferred to Japanese agencies for implementation; (7) Increase the production of all important domestic raw materials and finished goods; (8) Improve the effectiveness of the food collection plan.

However, for the past five or six months, due to the deflation of Japanese currency and the instability of prices and wages, these eight plans have failed to be implemented. The US State Department's new instructions on the 17th reiterated the old issues and urged the Japanese government to earnestly fulfill them. However, anyone who understands the inner workings of the Japanese economy knows that without preventing currency inflation, seeking Japan's economic recovery is like trying to catch fish by climbing a tree. This path is definitely not feasible. But why is the US so concerned about Japan's economic recovery today? And why is it so eager to see Japan's economic recovery? These two questions are really worth our attention and research.

According to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press on the 18th, the United States is trying to build Japan into a major fortress as part of its anti-communist defense line in the Pacific. The State Department's instructions on stabilizing the Japanese economy, announced on the 17th, coincide with the new US policy of supporting Japan. From this telegram, we can easily see the US's direction in the Far East. To put it bluntly, in the eyes of the US authorities, the situation in China is beyond saving. Therefore, it is shifting the focus of its anti-communist and anti-Soviet efforts in Asia from "aid to China" to "supporting Japan." In other words, US aid to China will actually be like removing a short ladder halfway, turning a blind eye, abandoning its ally in the war against a common enemy, and instead coaxing the enemy in the war! To discerning observers, every move the US has made recently in the Far East is obvious. It is permissible for the Japanese to take advantage of the situation and deliberately express concern about the situation in China, implying to the US that the deterioration of the situation in China is enough to affect Japan's position in the Far East, teaching the US that it must immediately provide full assistance to Japan. The new instructions issued by the US on the 17th contain this intention, so in the eyes of the Japanese, it can be said to be "a dream come true," no wonder the defeated Japanese are all smiling with satisfaction.

However, in our view, the problem with the US "supporting Japan to contain communism" is not whether to support Japan, but whether supporting Japan can contain communism. All scholars familiar with Asian geography value the decisive influence of geographical factors on military diplomacy. We assume that a US-Soviet conflict is inevitable, and if it unfortunately breaks out, the US can only use Japan as a base for attacking the mainland. Regardless of the strength of its naval and air forces, it is difficult to have a grasp on victory. American military strategists, who have recently expressed their opinions on this point, unanimously pointed out that even General MacArthur, who is in charge of the control of Japan, is keenly aware that if China is controlled by the Communist Party, all of Asia will be inevitable, and Japan's position will inevitably be weakened, and it will be in the middle of a continental pincer. How can the wise diplomatic authorities of the United States not have even this basic common sense?

In short, if the US wants to abandon its Truman Doctrine of anti-communism and anti-Sovietism, it is better not to take the lead and continue the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Otherwise, it must not neglect the importance of China's position in the Far East. In other words, if the United States abandons the broad road of "aid to China" and wants to take the narrow path of "supporting Japan," it is tantamount to abandoning the fundamental for the superficial. In the future world situation, the United States will inevitably suffer the consequences and regret it too late. Therefore, today, we are still willing to uphold the righteousness of wartime allies, for the sake of world peace, we must ask "Will the US Intensify its Support for Japan?" to the American government and the public, and hope that they appeal to their conscience and foresight.

### Increased Production and Improvement of Ping Coal

— Our Reporter Liu Zao

[Our Newspaper Nanchang Eighteenth Dispatch] The Pingxiang Anyuan and Gaokeng coal mines run by the Ganxi Coal Mining Bureau are currently burdened with a major task. Not only must they supply coal to the railways and power plants of Zhe-Gan, Yue-Han, and cities such as Changsha and Nanchang, but also a portion of the coal for civilian use in Jing-Hu and the motive power of the Ping-Han Railway must rely on Ping coal. Therefore, the Ganxi Coal Mining Bureau is currently making its utmost efforts to increase production and improve the quality of coal, in order to smoothly overcome the current difficulties.

While striving to increase production, they place some hope on American aid. However, the facts tell us that American aid has been a "beautiful prospect" all along. The American aid that the factory might receive was originally three million US dollars, and now an additional one million US dollars has been issued. The contract for purchasing equipment is currently being negotiated by the Resources Commission and the American firm Pierce Company.

Although the Ping Coal authorities are currently also living frugally, like everyone else, they are still continuously promoting production increase projects by "relying on their own efforts." It is reported that the first and second vertical shafts of Gaokeng have both been dug to the predetermined depth by mid-November, and are now engaged in the work of erecting beams and masonry. The second vertical shaft encountered a coal seam in mid-October, about 1.5 meters thick, which is quite valuable for mining. When the masonry is completed, a level tunnel will be opened at a depth of 190 meters in the well to prepare for coal production. Before the vertical shaft produces coal, in order to meet current needs, shallow mining projects are being strengthened, and new wells are planned to be excavated in Wangjiayuan and Zhanggongtang, with construction scheduled to begin in January next year.

The Quanjiang Weir power plant project saw its first 1,000 KW generator worked on day and night during the hottest days of the year, and it began supplying power on November 20th, solving the problem of insufficient power for Ping Coal. The second 1,000 KW generator is being installed, and the 2,000 KW generator originally stored in Shanghai is also being transported to Ping by the Zhe-Gan Railway. As long as these three generators are installed and the 4,000 KW power generation project is completed, Ping Coal can move from manual mining to mechanization, becoming the only mechanically mined mine in Jiangnan.

Strengthening transportation should be coordinated with the production increase plan. Currently, the mine has built the Quangao branch line from Gaokeng to Quanjiang Weir, which connects to the Zhe-Gan Railway, allowing coal produced from the first and third mines of Gaokeng to be transported to Baimao Temple Station for loading and external transportation. However, the coal produced from the fourth and fifth mines of Wangjiayuan and the mines of Anyuan must be transported to the station by shoulder carrying or handcart, which is not only expensive but also time-consuming. The mining bureau has now decided to erect an overhead cableway between Wangjiayuan and Baimao Temple. The equipment required for this project has been prepared, and construction began in mid-October. The trees along the line have been felled, and iron frames are being cast. It has also been decided to build a light railway between Anyuan and Pingxiang to facilitate transportation.

Ping Coal originally had a good reputation, but unfortunately, the operators of general earthen wells and coal merchants only knew how to seek temporary gains, mixing inferior coal with mud and stones, which was inconvenient to burn and reduced firepower, destroying the past reputation. Now, the Ganxi Coal Mining Bureau is striving to improve the quality of Ping coal. All coal produced in the mining area is not only manually selected and washed, but also equipped with coal washing machines to increase the washing capacity. The mine also has a chemical laboratory, and the coal produced in each well is chemically tested and analyzed at any time. This is extremely beneficial to the identification and improvement of coal quality, and is also a pioneering initiative among the coal bases in Central China.

### National Civil Servants Prepare for General Strike: The Italian Government Issues Warning: A Large Number of Privately Hidden Military Supplies Were Seized

[United Press Rome Nineteenth Dispatch] Prime Minister Gasperi will personally appeal to the nation tonight to break the planned general strike of 1.5 million civil servants on the 20th. The Prime Minister's office said that Gasperi will reiterate the government's declaration of the 18th, that civil servants have legal and moral obligations to the country, and that strikes are undemocratic pressure to force the parliament to overturn the cabinet's salary increase plan. It also implied that the government will sanction any civil servant who "deliberately abandons work and hinders and disrupts the continuity and normality of service."

### Huge Crowds Surge in Front of City Bank: Thirty to Forty Thousand People Travel Back and Forth in Vain: Deposit Exchange Postponed: Simplifying Methods Being Discussed Today: Mayor Personally Issues Written Instructions and the Crowd Disperses Disappointed

[Our Newspaper Report] After the change in the deposit exchange method, yesterday was the first period for distributing application forms for deposit exchange to public educators in the city. In order to handle the matter centrally, the authorities specifically entrusted the Shanghai City Bank on Jiujiang Road to exclusively distribute 400 application forms, while the Central Bank on the Bund was responsible for the accumulated cases of military and police personnel who had obtained permits before the 16th of this month but had not yet been exchanged. Unexpectedly, the crowding situation for public educators applying yesterday completely exceeded the authorities' expectations. Moreover, the application forms were concentrated and issued exclusively by the City Bank, which caused disorder in the exchange order and a large number of exchange people, which was unprecedented since the authorities implemented the deposit exchange method. If the security authorities had not worked hard to maintain order, and the public educators had not rationally controlled themselves, an unfortunate incident would have occurred again.

Since the authorities designated yesterday as the exclusive day for handling the application for deposit exchange for public educators, all public educators in the city spared no effort to save their hard-earned money, or tried to raise money from relatives and friends, in order to compete for this valuable ounce or two of gold. As a result, before the curfew time began the night before, many public educators lined up and waited at the entrance of the City Bank, willing to endure the wind and dew and sit and wait. Until dawn this morning, public educators from all directions rushed to queue up, and the police bureau, upon receiving the news, also sent a team to maintain order. However, the number of public educators flocking to the City Bank increased with time. Before 9 o'clock, the entrance of the City Bank was already crowded. At first, the line was winding, from Jiujiang Road to the west, to Sichuan Middle Road to the north, to Nanjing Road to the Bund and then to the south, and then back to Jiujiang Road to the City Bank. This was constantly circling, reaching a total of six circles, with an estimated number of about 30,000 to 40,000 people. How could the mere 400 application forms be enough to cope with this huge queue. The City Bank hesitated and could not decide, and the queue waiting outside could not withstand the pressure of crowding, squeezing, hunger, and cold, and the noise was constant, and the order began to be chaotic, and the military and police also felt unable to maintain order. Finally, some representatives were pushed out from the crowd of deposit exchange people, together with the personnel maintaining security, and consulted with the City Bank authorities to request additional application forms. The City Bank authorities immediately called Mayor Wu for instructions, and Mayor Wu personally issued a written instruction, which read in brief: "Today's application number is unbearably crowded. It has been decided to convene a meeting of central and local agencies and schools on the afternoon of the 20th to discuss a simple deposit exchange method to facilitate all public educators." All the public educators expressed their grievances, but they could not do anything about it and began to leave disappointed.

It is also reported that in the future, deposit exchanges for military and police personnel will be based on the permits issued by the Garrison Command and the Police Bureau, and the deposit exchanges will be handled in the Garrison Command every Wednesday. The second distribution of application forms to the general public by the four banks will be held on the 23rd.

### Case of Two Police Officers Extorting Money Retried and Sentenced to Five Years Each

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of city councilor Jia Maihai reporting police officers Lin Zhicheng and Wu Xicang for jointly extorting money was retried in court the day before yesterday. The two criminals were sentenced to five years of imprisonment each and deprived of their civil rights for three years. Wang Minghai and Xu Wenqing often exchanged goods such as cigarettes with Westerners on ships at the Meifu Wharf to make a small profit.

On June 6 of this year, Wang Minghai exchanged seven packs of cigarettes for beer from a Westerner on a ship. When he returned to shore, Lin and Wu accused him of stealing the cigarettes and dragged him to a sampan, demanding 20 million yuan in legal tender. Wang paid 10 million yuan and was released. On June 22, Lin and Wu, while on duty patrolling the water, saw Wang and Xu hawking on the side of a ship. They arrested them on the pretext of arresting scalpers and telegraphed the Donggou Police Station of the Water Police Sub-bureau, requesting additional police officers such as Zhao Zhengzhong to pursue Xu Wenqing to his home and arrest Wang and Xu. En route, the ward chief, Shen Miaoling, asked about the reason for the arrest. Lin and others said that Wang and others had suspicious behavior. Later, Zhao Zhengzhong and others left, saying that the task of assisting in the arrest of scalpers had been accomplished. On the way to the station, Lin and others demanded that Wang Minghai pay the outstanding 10 million yuan. Wang gathered the money nearby and paid it off. Soon after, Councilor Jia learned about the matter and reported it to the police bureau, which arrested Lin and others and transferred them to the court for trial. After the judgment, Lin and others applied for a retrial. The High Court sent the case back for retrial, and the above sentence was pronounced.

### The Righteous Spirit Will Endure Through the Ages, Glorifying the Mountains and Rivers: Generals Huang and Liu Achieve Immortality; Memorial Services Held by All Circles; Division Commander Li Shijing Also Attended the Meeting, Supported by a Handcart Due to Illness

Leading figures from the city's party, government, and military organs, as well as representatives from various organizations and schools, totaling over three thousand people, attended the event. General Huang's surviving family members, sons Xiaoxian, Zhenxian, Jingxian, and Shaoxian, and daughters Shuming, Shuwen, and Shuling, also attended the service in mourning attire, weeping uncontrollably. A simple white archway was erected at the entrance of the Tianchan Theater, and a charity sale of commemorative flowers was set up to benefit the bereaved family. A portrait of General Huang was hung in the center of the venue, with a horizontal banner reading "The Spirit Will Endure Through the Ages, Glorifying the Mountains and Rivers" personally inscribed by the President above it. The surrounding area was filled with wreaths, and the walls were covered with elegiac couplets from various parties. Gu Zhutong's couplet read, "A hundred battles of heroic fame match tigers and leopards; A thousand years of righteousness glorifies the mountains and rivers." Mayor Wu's couplet read, "Vow to defend the famous city to the death; a hundred battles, loyal souls return to the upper realm; Sacrifice to complete the great integrity; a thousand homes' righteousness protects China." Speaker Pan's couplet read, "Righteousness can support mountains; Save the nation from peril; Why hesitate to die?; Heroic spirit repays the leather; Leave behind glorious merits; Eternal for thousands of ages." The atmosphere at the venue was solemn and dignified.

A Model for the Soldiers and Civilians of the Whole Country

The general assembly elected Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiqing, Wei Rulin, and fourteen others as the presidium, with Wu Guozhen serving as the chairman. After the memorial ceremony began amidst mournful music, the entire assembly bowed three times to General Huang's portrait. Mayor Wu then reverently presented a wreath before the spirit and delivered a eulogy, saying: The glorious sacrifice of General Huang and General Liu in this war is a great example for us to follow and is a role model for soldiers and civilians of the whole country. The commissioner, while in the front line, was always reminded of General Huang's loyalty and unyielding spirit. All the soldiers could not help but be moved to tears. It is clear that General Huang is an inspirational example with a spirit that moved to the depth of the heart. Wu concluded by quoting Yue Wumu's famous line: "If the world is to be peaceful, civil officials must not be greedy, and military officials must not fear death." He said: Today's situation is worse than when the Jin soldiers invaded the south back then. The soldiers at the front and the people in the rear should thoroughly awaken and use General Huang as a self-motivation, so that the great cause of suppressing the bandits and quelling the chaos can be completed in the shortest possible time.

Tears Streaming Down Their Faces, The Entire Assembly Was Moved

Subsequently, Yu Xingchu, a close friend of General Huang during his lifetime, reported on the life of Commander Huang, and Deputy Division Commander Yao of the 67th Division reported on the life of Division Commander Liu. During the report, Division Commander Li Shijing of the 108th Division also attended the meeting, supported by a handcart, escorted by guards. Division Commander Li was originally a subordinate of General Huang's 25th Army. After being transferred to the Corps, he was wounded in the battle of Nianzhuang and transferred to Shanghai for treatment. He had his last phone call with Commander Huang before leaving the front line. When he came to the meeting yesterday, his foot injury had not healed, he was wearing a cotton military uniform, and his spirit was excellent. However, after meeting General Huang's family members, he was reminded of his former superior, and they cried together. The entire assembly was deeply moved and could not stop wiping away their tears. Mayor Wu specially made a temporary motion to pay tribute to this national hero. The entire assembly stood up solemnly and bowed in salute amidst warm applause.

Thoroughly Awaken, Reflect, and Rise Up Together

Speaker Pan then delivered a speech, stating: Since the news of the martyrdom of Generals Huang and Liu spread, everyone, whether acquainted or not, was deeply moved. General Huang's troops had been stationed in Shanghai after their victory and were then transferred to northern Jiangsu. Their strict military discipline was well known to the citizens of Shanghai. A model soldier like General Huang was not only unafraid of death but also did not love money. If he was not afraid of death, how could he still love money? In other words, it was precisely because he did not love money that he was not afraid of death. Those who fear death are greedy for money. The formation of today's situation is really due to too many officials who fear death and greedy officials. If the officials in the front and rear can all emulate General Huang's integrity, how can the bandit forces be so rampant? China will definitely not perish. Pan also quoted General Huang's will, which stated that Shanghai is a den of sin and warned his eldest son to have ambition, aspirations, and not be affected by the bad environment. He pointed out that this remark should serve as a motto for every citizen of Shanghai. Everyone should be vigilant, thoroughly awaken, and reflect. In this difficult situation, we must strive to get rid of the temptation of pleasure and hope that this meeting today will be the starting point. Following in the footsteps of Generals Huang and Liu, we will rise up together and contribute all our strength to defend the nation.

Loyal and Refined Self-Encouragement, Continue Efforts

Fang Zhi's speech briefly stated: I have recently been entrusted by all circles in the city to go to the front line twice to comfort the soldiers fighting the bandits. Today, I would like to express my greatest condolences to the spirits of Generals Huang and Liu on behalf of the comfort group. The deaths of Generals Huang and Liu were heroic and caused national mourning. Now that the bodies of the two generals are dead, their spirit of loyalty and patriotism will remain in the hearts of the people forever and last as long as the life of the Chinese nation. So we don't have to be sad about the martyrdom of the two generals, but should be loyal and refined self-encouragement, take the two generals as the law, and continue to work hard for the bandit.

Then Shui Xiangyun, Long Guanjun and others delivered speeches one after another. Finally, Mayor Wu, on behalf of the general assembly and the National Comfort General Association, presented condolences and consolation money to General Huang's family. It was received by Huang's son Xiaoxian. The meeting ended at about 12 o'clock.

He was able to complete the task, and finally, with less than a regiment, he was trapped by bandits more than ten times in Zengbajic. Division Commander Liu led his troops in a bloody battle, repeatedly charging and killing. Unfortunately, the officers and soldiers were almost completely killed, the ammunition was exhausted, and the reinforcements were cut off. The position was broken by the bandits. He sent out the last telegram: "Sheng has an old mother above, and a weak wife and young daughter below. The family is poor. Please take care of them properly. The post will take the determination of a revolutionary soldier not to succeed and become benevolent, coexist with the position, and repay the country and the leader," etc. Then he collected wheat straw, piled it in the garden, covered it with a door panel, ordered his armorer to destroy the traces after his death, and then shouted Long live the Republic of China, long live the President, and shot himself with a gun, which hit the brain and killed him. This was the matter of 14:00 on November 11. According to Liu's guard Guo Qingsheng, when General Liu committed suicide, he tried to snatch the gun to stop him. The general glared at him and scolded, "Do you want me to be captured by bandits?" And kicked him to the ground, so he could not stop him. Alas, the loyalty of the general is enough to move the heaven and earth and cry the gods, and inspire the late world. However, General Liu has a 75-year-old mother above, and a weak wife and two young daughters below. After his death, he is desolate, so what should he do? It is also heard that Liu's wife is currently living at No. 7 Tieping Lane, Suzhou. Her body was originally weak, and recently, due to the bad news of General Liu, she has not eaten for ten days, causing the several-month-old unborn child to suddenly have a miscarriage, and the situation is even more tragic. Now, Generals Zhou Zhidao, Dai Jian, Huang Xiang, Xu Wuyan, and Zhang Xuzi have jointly requested the superiors to report to the government, to declare General's martyrdom in the history museum, and to give him a national funeral and preferential treatment to comfort the heroic spirit.

### Saint John's University

Wins University Basketball Championship

In the finals of the third university basketball tournament on the 18th, Saint John's University defeated Fudan University 46-27 to win the championship of the group. They will play against the champion of the group Jiaotong University to determine the university championship. Jiaotong University has lost to Saint John's in the first two tournaments. Now that they meet again on a narrow road, a special venue will be borrowed from the city gymnasium to hold the event. The battle between the two schools will surely be a heated performance.

The game between Saint John's and Fudan was held at Fudan. The players of Saint John's were not used to the hard ground. Fudan took the lead 8-7 in the first quarter. In the first half, Saint John's came from behind to lead 25-11. After the break, the two teams fought again. Fudan's Zhuo Guanzheng was resourceful, and Saint John's Qian Tujun and Zhuang Yirong attacked on both sides, making it difficult to distinguish. Saint John's was still in the lead in the third quarter. In the last quarter, Saint John's Sun Guoqi's long shots were excellent, and Fudan was far behind and unable to turn the tide. After Saint John's Tao Yingshi graduated due to fouls, Fudan could have taken the opportunity to attack, but the score difference was too large, and Fudan had no intention to fight. As a result, Saint John's defeated Fu with a score of 46-27 and won the championship of the group.

### In the Eyes of "Upper-Class Refugees," the First "Stronghold": Hengyang Is Unexpectedly Lively

— Special Correspondent for Our Newspaper, Huang Chao-Ru

[Express News from Changsha, 16th of This Month] Hengyang, this small, inconspicuous city, suddenly became an important town in the rear during the Anti-Japanese War due to its geographical location. Commerce flourished, and the population increased sharply, reaching its peak for a time. Towards the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the 47-day Battle of Hengyang became famous. However, this city that rose during the war was unfortunately completely destroyed in this battle.

At the beginning of the victory, Hengyang did not have a single complete house. There were broken walls and ruins everywhere, and desolate weeds and smoke. Then came the great famine in southern Hunan, and Hengyang became a city of famine victims. After these successive disasters, Hengyang survived in a dying state. Now, except for the main streets of Zhongshan Road North and South, which have neon lights and broadcasts of decadent music, and crowded pedestrians in the evening, there is not much difference from the time of victory in other places. Everyone feels like they are dreaming about restoring the scene during the war.

Distinguished Guests Arrive, Temporarily Observe the Situation

However, due to the tense situation of the locust war, wealthy merchants from Beijing and Shanghai are vying to "flee" south, and Hengyang has unexpectedly become lively again. Of course, the "escape" destinations of wealthy merchants will not be Hengyang. The most important thing is definitely the United States, followed by Hong Kong and Taiwan, and then Guangzhou and other places. However, everyone knows that going to the United States is beyond the reach of ordinary people, and the prices in Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Guangzhou are also quite difficult to bear. Many "refugees" who ran to Hong Kong and then turned back shook their heads and sighed, "Hong Kong and Guangzhou are good, but they can't stay for long." Therefore, Hengyang, which is also considered a "safe zone," has been honored by these distinguished guests. They regard Hengyang as the first stronghold for "evacuation," temporarily hiding here to observe the situation. It is very convenient to go from Hengyang to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Guilin, and even into Guizhou and Yunnan. In addition, people from the Beijing and Shanghai areas who had lived in Hengyang for many years during the war naturally have a sense of familiarity with Hengyang. At this time, everyone is "escaping," so why not make a trip down memory lane? As a result, Hengyang has gradually become lively in the past month, and everything is thriving.

Rumors Abound, Nerves Are Tense

Recently, the place that shows the revival of the wartime lively scene in Hengyang is the East Railway Station of Hengyang. On the Yuehan Railway, long trains of carriages are piled with passengers like "sardines." Although many of them pass through here to Guangzhou, there are also many who get off here and transfer to Guilin. Not only are there passengers, but also many government officials, official documents and goods from agencies, and relatives of civil servants. The Hengyang Station has become congested. When this unusual scene first unfolded, the citizens of Hengyang couldn't help but feel both happy and worried, and doubts arose. There were many rumors on the streets, and everyone's nerves were a little tense and sensitive, causing trouble for no reason. There was a situation of "a storm is brewing." Not only the citizens but even government officials and news reporters were like this.

Here are two small anecdotes specially reported that are enough to make people smile:

Four Aircraft in the Sky Over Hengyang - The Truth

One noon, four transport planes were spotted in the sky over Hengyang. After circling slightly, they landed at the airport. In the past, although planes also took off and landed in Hengyang every day, it had never been seen that four planes landed at the same time. So the personnel at the airport had a flash of inspiration, thinking that it must be important central leaders coming south. They rushed to greet them, and when they opened the hatches, they only saw seven of the latest model small cars and boxes loaded in each plane. They retreated in disappointment. When news reporters went to inquire about the news, they couldn't help but be greatly disappointed after hearing the truth and looked at each other speechlessly. It was heard that the four planes were passing through Hengyang to Guangzhou and landed to refuel. One said that they were China Aviation passenger planes, but China Aviation then publicly denied it.

Family Luggage Mistaken for Important Officials

At around 11 o'clock on the same night, the city government and various newspaper offices suddenly received information that Vice President Li's special train was passing through Hengyang. The municipal leaders and news reporters who heard the news dared not miss the opportunity, so they braved the night cold to welcome him across the river. When they arrived at the station, the news reporters immediately launched a surprise attack and inquired about Vice President Li's whereabouts. As a result, there was no Vice President on the "special train." It turned out that it was the family members and luggage of important officials from Guangxi, such as Xia Wei, Li Pinxian, and Beijing-based legislators. There were about 400 people in total. The entire train was occupied by them, including two first-class carriages, four second-class carriages, and five baggage cars. It was heard that the luggage of a certain important official alone reached as many as 400 pieces, almost occupying one carriage. By this time, it was late at night, and those who went to welcome him had to return with a loss of interest.

Many Fantasies, Reality Is Even More Miserable

Today, Hengyang is in this tense and sensitive atmosphere. Everyone is fantasizing that a very different situation will unfold soon. They are calculating how to grasp this situation and weaving a beautiful picture of future life. Before the beautiful imagination has been woven, the painful reality that has arrived has intensified, because the land, houses, and goods in Hengyang have been rising rapidly these days, although they are still much cheaper than in Hong Kong and Guangzhou.

### NANTUNG'S ECONOMIC HEART: TA SHENG COTTON MILL CELEBRATES ITS FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY

— OUR CORRESPONDENT TSUNG YUNGSHU

(NANTUNG, 14TH - VIA EXPRESS) TA SHENG COTTON MILL holds a special place in Nantung's history. It is not just another factory; Nantung owes its prosperity to it. Founded in the 24th year of the Guangxu reign (1899 AD), it is now exactly fifty years old. My visit on the eve of this milestone makes it all the more significant.

TA SHENG COTTON MILL is located in Tangzha Township, about fifteen li northwest of Nantun County. From here, it's only ten li to Tian Sheng Port, the largest port of entry/exit in Northern Kiangsu. Tangzha is a large market town at the southern end of the Tung-Yu Highway, and the surrounding area is the famous

TUNG COTTON PRODUCING AREA

The fine cotton from Tungtai and Taichungchieh, as well as cotton from along the Tung-Yu Highway, are all conveniently transported here. In the past, when northern Kiangsu was peaceful, large trucks carried bales of cotton down the Tung-Yu Highway, and ships full of cotton arrived. The TA SHENG COTTON MILL never had to worry about raw materials. Unfortunately, in recent years, the countryside has been unsettled, making it difficult to transport the fine cotton from places like Taichungchieh south, and procurement has become quite troublesome. During the period when price controls were enforced, precisely when cotton was at its peak, even a single load of cotton was hard to buy. The factory nearly shut down, but fortunately, they purchased a batch of Indian cotton to temporarily help. However, to maintain operations, they switched to a three-day work schedule, operating for three days and then resting for three days. Recently, things have been better, and they can still maintain operations by collecting some cotton.

TA SHENG TEXTILES

The company has four factories. The one in Tangzha is called TA SHENG MILL Number One. There is also TA SHENG MILL Number Eight, also called TA SHENG MILL CHIH, located south of Nantung city. TA SHENG MILL Number Three is in Haimen, a place that was named after the factory itself. There is also TA SHENG MILL Number Two in Chiulongchen, Chongming. Mill Number One, the oldest, occupies over 100 mu of land and is divided into two factories. It originally had 92,500 spindles, but they were destroyed by the Japanese during the occupation. Now, only 73,000 spindles can be operated. There were originally 600 looms, but only two-thirds are currently in use, totaling five hundred. If production is normal, it can produce 130 bales of yarn and 600 bolts of cloth per day. The entire factory has over 150 staff members and over 5,800 workers, with female workers accounting for more than three-fifths of the workforce. Most of the workers live in Tangzha Township and the nearby countryside. The factory pays considerable attention to the welfare of its workers, providing literacy classes, apprentice training classes, a staff clinic, a staff cooperative, a staff reading room, a staff sports field, and a staff recreation room. For the education of staff children, there is a school for staff children. There are also favorable provisions for things like pensions for worker deaths, subsidies for female worker births, and relief for poor workers.

TA SHENG COTTON MILL is the economic heart of Nantung. As long as it's running, Nantung's agriculture, industry, and commerce are all active. Nantung owes its prosperity to it.

For fifty years, TA SHENG COTTON MILL has been supporting

Various undertakings in Nantung:

Educational initiatives, such as Nantung College and its affiliated hospital, Tungchow Teachers College, Girls' Teachers College, and schools for the blind and deaf, and charitable endeavors, such as homes for the elderly, orphanages, and institutions for the disabled, rely on the support of the mill. The circulation of Nantung's local financial economy also depends on TA SHENG COTTON MILL to maintain flexibility. Therefore, TA SHENG COTTON MILL has a special relationship with Nantung, unlike factories in other places. It was established in Nantung, brought prosperity to Nantung, and used local industry for local construction, which is a great example.

To commemorate this historically significant 50th anniversary, TA SHENG COTTON MILL has established TA SHENG Memorial Primary School near the factory. The school building is currently under construction. At the same time, a bronze statue of Chang S'en Kung and a commemorative碑will be erected in front of the personnel department office to remember the pioneers. On the 18th of this month, a warm commemorative ceremony was held to celebrate and inspire.

### On the Yu Road: Bad People Reap Bad Consequences - By Our Reporter Jin Tao

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, Our Newspaper, 10th] The Shen-Yu Road is so long, hearts are so anxious, and the Communist bandits are so full of tricks. However, people must go west and return home. The bandits sift downwards along the way like a sieve, sifting out soldiers and those they deem criminals. They sift road by road, retaining strong officers and soldiers (especially those from the Northeast). Near Suizhong and Shanhaiguan, they were detained, escorted back, organized into teams, and taken off the main road, away from the eyes of the public, and escorted back to Shenyang or Harbin via small paths, never to be "liberated."

In the past, there were certainly many shrewd and self-respecting individuals in the Northeast National Army ranks, but there were also many who acted recklessly. These bad officers and soldiers came from all provinces. On the road, I heard the villagers' complaints: so-and-so beats people, curses people, steals chickens, slaughters pigs, and demands fodder and grain without any rules. They made the good people suffer immensely. The actions of intelligence personnel were even more infuriating.

Those bad people are truly the greatest sinners of the nation. They made the people shed tears in their stomachs, made the people helpless, made the people change their allegiance, and built a high wall and dug a wide ditch between the military and the people, resulting in non-cooperation and reduced intelligence, giving the entire National Army a fatal blow.

In addition, some soldiers have started families, marrying wives. Squad leaders, platoon leaders, company commanders, and even some soldiers have married and had children, always thinking of their families first, prioritizing family matters above all else, putting personal interests before public duties, dividing their energy, and ruining their motivation. Family burdens and responsibilities have further driven them to engage in business, ultimately affecting the overall situation.

In this westward movement of soldiers, many family members followed, enduring great hardship. Some took peasant-pulled carts, traveling in an endless stream. When encountering several teams of "irregular troops" on the Rao Yang River, who were marching, they mocked, ridiculed, and taunted these officers and soldiers. Many shouted at the families of soldiers on the carts: "Look at the officer's wives!" "How did you get defeated!"

Don't Communist soldiers marry wives? Yes, they don't. They have excessive restrictions. Not only can squad leaders, platoon leaders, and company commanders not marry wives, but battalion commanders cannot either. Only at the regimental commander level can they marry. And they marry well-trained wives, female staff members with firm Party consciousness and faith. What about the others? They either wait for the future or find other ways out.

Do Communist soldiers not need grain or grass? They do, and they need a lot. As soon as they took Shenyang, they started demanding grass and grain from the villagers. For every ten acres of land, they demanded 150 bundles of grain and a certain amount of grass immediately. Some places demanded even more. In Beizhen and Luyangyi, I saw cart after cart of grain being delivered. The mentality of the people is still, "Whoever is the emperor, we give tribute to." It is said that "the Eighth Route Army's demand for grain, grass, and carts is the responsibility of the farmers' association, with a fixed amount, not everyone demanding grain, everyone demanding grass, and everyone demanding carts, or even selling it and then demanding it again, with a few pocketing the money and the government not getting the benefits."

On the road, I saw nearly a column of Communist troops marching. Everyone, except for a gun or sometimes no gun, had almost nothing else. Lightly equipped, they marched quickly. Platoon, company, and battalion commanders all walked together. "Add oil," "Eat at XX," sometimes it was a burst of applause, sometimes they sang short and lively songs, which had a great effect.

Communist soldiers come from the people and have mostly not shed their peasant roots. The Communists subject them to strict training, with only vertical control and no horizontal connections. They only know how to sell their lives and can only consider charging forward, like a flood, like madness. Everyone has only this one path!

### Second Batch of Taiwan Sugar for Japan to be Shipped Out Completely Within the Month

The second batch of Taiwan sugar totaling 20,000 tons for export to Japan by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, of which 17,000 tons had already been shipped in two giant vessels, the remaining 3,000 tons is soon to be completed, and the entire amount can be shipped completely within this month. The third batch of Taiwan sugar for export to Japan will start shipping between February and March next year. According to the person in charge of the company, major cities in Japan have now become fixed export markets for our Taiwan sugar.

In addition, the sugarcane planted by the company this year has now fully grown and is scheduled to start sugar production after January next year. There are a total of 37 sugar factories preparing for sugar production, of which 35 produce granulated sugar and 2 produce brown sugar. It is estimated that the sugarcane planted this year can produce 400,000 tons of Taiwan sugar.

### Taiwan Sugar Production Increases, Reaching 450,000 Tons This Year

[Our Newspaper] The Taiwan Sugar Corporation's original estimated sugar production for this year was 400,000 tons. However, due to the better climate this year compared to previous years and fewer wind disasters, sugarcane fields have generally had bumper harvests. Therefore, it is estimated that this year's sugar production can increase to 450,000 tons.

In the current situation, the domestic market has become narrower. Therefore, the company authorities will focus on securing foreign export markets in the future.

According to the current world market price of sugar, taking 96-degree raw sugar as the standard, it is approximately 5 cents per pound in New York (including tariffs, etc.). Calculated at this market price, Taiwan sugar production must reach more than 600,000 tons annually for exports to break even. To achieve this export level, the company authorities can only dedicate themselves to increasing production. The only obstacle to increased production is the lack of working capital.

For example, taking this year's sugar production as an example, assuming 400,000 tons, sugarcane farmers should receive 200,000 tons under the sugar distribution method as compensation for planting sugarcane. However, the result of the sugarcane farmers' sugar distribution last year was that they suffered losses because the sugar price happened to be low after obtaining the physical sugar. Therefore, this year, they will request the company to change to paying cash according to the market price of sugar. And the funds required for these 200,000 tons of sugar have reached NT$500 billion, a huge amount. Even with the financial strength of the Bank of Taiwan, its maximum issuance amount is only NT$92 billion. It also feels helpless in the face of this huge demand for funds. To protect the interests of sugarcane farmers and increase their interest in planting sugarcane, these funds must be fully raised to maintain Taiwan sugar's production next year. It is heard that the Central Bank and relevant authorities have expressed sympathy for the company's urgent need for working capital and promised to work together to find a solution.

### Cigarette Industry in Decline

Shanghai Municipal Industrial Association Technology Committee news: There are 95 cigarette factories in the Shanghai area, employing more than 35,000 workers. The monthly output of various cigarettes is approximately 120,000 cases, accounting for about 50% of the total national production.

Recently, due to the spread of war and the expansion of the war zone, sales channels have become narrower. At the same time, heavy taxes, high wages, and insufficient capital turnover, requiring high-interest loans to cover necessary expenses, have greatly affected costs. More than one-third of factories have been forced to suspend operations, directly affecting the livelihoods of workers and indirectly reducing national tax revenue. It is facing the most dangerous and desperate situation. If the authorities do not provide low-interest loans for relief, not only will the future of the industry be unimaginable, but the impact on national tax revenue will also be extremely great.

### Silver and Iron Industries Settle Interest Today, All Banks and Firms Take a Day Off

The silver and money industries will handle the semi-annual interest settlement matters as usual today. All banks and firms will take a day off to the outside world, and internally will step up the settlement of semi-annual accounts. In addition, the yarn and cloth markets, etc., are also closed for one day due to the suspension of bill exchange today.
