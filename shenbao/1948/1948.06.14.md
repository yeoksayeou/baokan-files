### Speakers of Hubei Province and Wuhan City Councils Issue Joint Telegram to President, Urging Bai Chongxi and Cheng Qian to Return to Wuhan Promptly

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 13th Dispatch] He Chengjun and Zhang Michuan, speakers of the Hubei Province and Wuhan City Councils, recently sent a joint telegram to President Chiang Kai-shek and Minister He Yingqin, urging them to promptly urge Bai Chongxi and Cheng Qian to return to Wuhan to preside over the two major tasks of suppressing bandits and pacifying the people in central China. The telegram stated in brief: "Recently, the treacherous bandits have been causing disturbances in northern Hunan and central Hubei. Xiangfan is under urgent threat, Jingzhou and Shashi are on the verge of danger, and counties such as Hankou, Chuan, Mian, Yang, Jing, Shan, and Qianjiang have fallen one after another. Military suppression and political pacification are equally important. Currently, Commander-in-Chief Bai and Director Cheng are still staying in Nanjing and Shanghai, and both major tasks are felt to be without anyone in charge. The public is extremely apprehensive, and it is extremely worrying. If the bandits cross the Yangtze River, it will not only shake Nanjing but also shake the foundation of the nation. Director Cheng has been stationed in Wuhan for many years, defending the capital, and his contribution has been great. We earnestly request that he be urged to return to Wuhan as soon as possible to preside over the work of pacifying central China." According to reports, since Bai and Cheng humbly declined their new posts, there has been much speculation here about future personnel arrangements. The general expectation is that the central government will adapt to actual needs and determine the candidates for suppressing bandits and pacifying central China as soon as possible. Furthermore, Garrison Commander Ruan Qi was summoned to Nanjing by plane on the 13th.

### Rules of Procedure of the Control Yuan to be Discussed at the First Meeting This Morning

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] The first plenary session of the first Control Yuan under the Constitution is scheduled to be held at 9 AM on the 14th, presided over by Chairman Yu Youren. The scheduled agenda will include discussion of the rules of procedure for the meeting. The Secretariat of the plenary session has already drafted a draft of the rules of procedure and submitted it to the plenary session as a reference document. Among them, there are provisions for the exercise of the power of supervision and the power of consent. However, the implementing regulations for the Control Law, the Impeachment Law, and the Indictment Law will be drafted separately, and all draft bills will only be implemented after they have been passed by the Legislative Yuan. However, the Control Yuan hopes to complete the formal procedures before the end of June so that the work of this session can be promoted quickly. Furthermore, after the rules of procedure are passed, the task of the plenary session will be to discuss the method of exercising the power of consent. After that, it will be the implementation of the power of consent, consenting to the President's nominations for the presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans, as well as the members of the Examination Committee and the Grand Justices. It is also learned that the candidate for Auditor-General of the Control Yuan will also be nominated by the President and consented to by the Legislative Yuan. It is currently learned that this candidate may be Lin Yunhai for reappointment.

### Time Not Ripe for Currency Reform; Government Has Indeed Drafted Several Plans; Implementation of Silver Standard Impossible

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] Amid the daily depreciation of currency value, the issue of currency reform has now become one of the most important issues attracting attention nationwide. Since Dong XianGuang's remarks acknowledged that the government already has a plan for currency reform, this statement has become increasingly noisy, and some have even said that it has been decided to implement the silver standard. Over the past few days, the reporter has had interviews with officials and experts, and the comprehensive conclusion obtained is: the government has indeed drafted several currency reform plans, but the time for implementation will depend on when the objective conditions are met. Therefore, the matter is being handled with special caution, waiting for the appropriate time. Bei Zuyi's trip to the United States this time is related to contacting loans for currency reform and carries several plans for currency reform drafted by our country to provide reference for the United States. As for the standard to be adopted during future currency reforms, opinions differ, but the possibility of implementing the silver standard in the rumors is very small, because countries participating in the International Monetary Fund Conference must link their future currency systems with the International Monetary Fund. Therefore, the "International Managed Gold Standard System" is the most likely to be adopted.

### Opinions Differ on Timing and Conditions

Regarding the timing and conditions of currency reform, the opinions of various experts and parties also differ. Based on the experience of Germany's currency reform, Gu Chunfan advocates that there is no need to wait for inflation to stop, balance revenue and expenditure, or increase industrial and agricultural production before reforming the currency system. Because if we wait for these three conditions to be met, we will not know when currency reform can be implemented. Gu also believes that there are many difficulties in implementing the silver standard. He advocates implementing the gold exchange standard, reforming in stages. First, taxation should be calculated according to indexes, with the national currency as the main currency and the legal tender as the auxiliary currency. When revenue and expenditure are balanced, the national currency will be fully adopted, and the legal tender will be abolished. Zhang Qianhua believes that the source of all chaos lies in the Communist Party. If the Communist bandits cannot be eliminated, currency reform will also be futile. However, if currency reform is carried out, the capital of wealthy families should be used as reserve funds. Liu Butong advocates that currency reform should adopt the gold standard, but the method of unlimited exchange should not be adopted. Domestic peace must be achieved, the vested interests class must be destroyed, and revenue and expenditure must be balanced before currency reform can be carried out. Cao Guoqing and Gu Hegao (both professors at Jinling University) both believe that the current legal tender has been maliciously inflated and should be stopped immediately, or the number of issues should be limited first, and gradually stopped. Professor Wu Feidan pointed out that there is currently a trend of reforming the currency system and implementing the silver standard. However, the silver standard has become an outdated standard system in the world and should not be adopted. He advocates implementing a "new gold exchange standard" system. Someone else pointed out that implementing the silver standard must be the country with the most silver production, but Mexico has now abandoned the silver standard and implemented the gold standard. Jian Guansan believes that although the general public is enthusiastic about currency reform, the objective conditions do not exist. Jian pointed out that relying solely on foreign gold or silver cannot solve China's financial problems. Silver should only be used as subsidiary currency, not as the main currency. Combining various opinions, it is generally believed that the timing of currency reform is not yet ripe, and the silver standard is not a suitable and feasible standard system.

### Presidential Decree Appoints Vice Ministers of Various Departments

Li Chongshi as Secretary-General of the Control Yuan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] President issued the following orders on the 12th: (1) Appointed Li Chongshi as Secretary-General of the Control Yuan.

### Candidates for Presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans to be Nominated by President Within Days; Vice Presidents of the Two Yuans Likely to be Recommended by the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] The presidents and vice presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans will soon be nominated to the Control Yuan by the President. There is much speculation outside about the candidates. The reporter has recently learned from reliable sources that President Chiang is carefully considering the candidates and is expected to submit them within three or two days. Among them, Wang Chonghui has been internally designated as the President of the Judicial Yuan, while the President of the Examination Yuan and the two Vice Presidents have not yet been determined. It is rumored that Mo Dehui or Hui Qi will be nominated by the President as the President of the Examination Yuan, but this is not the case. It is heard that the President intends to appoint Mo Dehui as a Senior Advisor to the Presidential Office, so that he can consult his opinions on major national issues at any time. The vice presidents of the two Yuans may be recommended by the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties, respectively, each serving as the vice president of one Yuan. Furthermore, although the number of members of the previous Examination Yuan was not large, almost all were southerners. Therefore, the President has decided to nominate several candidates from the northeast and northern provinces in the upcoming nomination of Examination Committee members. Candidates for Grand Justices will also be nominated according to this principle to avoid regional bias.

### Weng Wenhao Invites Various Heads to Discuss Answers to Inquiries from Legislators

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] The policy guidelines proposed by President of the Executive Yuan Weng Wenhao to the Legislative Yuan had been discussed in detail by the heads of various ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan before they were presented to the Legislative Yuan.

### Legislators' Housing Problem to be Solved by the Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] The Legislative Yuan is now trying to solve the housing problem for legislators in Nanjing. Permanent dormitories have been arranged on Baixia Road, where the Legislative Yuan is preparing to build Houfu Apartments. At the same time, the Yuan has consulted the Executive Yuan to instruct the Nanjing Municipal Government to build more new public housing for government employees and teachers for legislators to rent and reside in. For the current temporary housing problem, the Yuan has rented several houses, which are divided into family dormitories and single dormitories. They will be allocated by lottery to legislators who have come to Nanjing from afar and those who have brought their families from the bandit areas and are still living in hotels. Those who wish to stay in hotels and do not intend to move to the dormitory can have their hotel expenses reviewed and paid by the Yuan, which will be deducted from their future rent subsidies. Those who have their own houses or more comfortable places to stay in Nanjing and do not need dormitories for the time being will be given rent subsidies.

### Zhang Jia'ao Speaks Out

Denies Relatives Manipulating the Market

[Central News Agency, This City] Recently, a legislator accused Zhang Jiaji, the former Governor of the Central Bank, of presiding over foreign exchange tasks during his tenure, and that his relatives inevitably had the suspicion of taking advantage of opportunities to manipulate the market. Zhang specifically issued the following statement on the 13th: "Jiaao has served the society and the government for more than 30 years, and the society has its own public opinion on his conduct and dealing with people; the recent accusation by a legislator, after investigation, shows that the foreign exchange granted and the exchange rate adjustments during my tenure all had a certain system. All merchants applying to purchase foreign exchange were subject to the strictest and most open review procedures by the Import and Export Control Commission, in accordance with the audit principles, and the names of all permit holders were published monthly. Since August 17 last year, the exchange rate has adopted a dynamic adjustment method, and a new Equalization Fund Committee has been established, with five members appointed by the National Government. The committee and designated bank representatives discuss and decide on the adjustment of the exchange rate every morning. I do not participate in this, and this exchange rate only applies to foreign exchange transactions with permits. I don't know how relatives can take advantage of opportunities to manipulate the market? All the work of the Import and Export Control Commission and the Equalization Fund Committee, I heard, has already been reported to the Yuan. Anyone who understands the actual situation will be able to judge whether it is right or wrong."

### Military and People Cooperate, Strong as Steel; Changchun is Impregnable; Commander Zeng Zesheng Issues Statement

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 13th Dispatch] The focus of the fighting in Changchun is in the southwestern suburbs. The bandits have attacked various fortresses for days, but have not succeeded.

Over a hundred shells landed in the Changchun city area on the 12th.

What is even more advanced is that tens of thousands of compatriots assist the National Army every day to strengthen the construction of city defense works, which is an unprecedented high degree of military-civilian cooperation in Changchun. The army loves the people, and the people love the army. The embodiment of this great spirit is not accidental. Hundreds of thousands of dear compatriots in Changchun can distinguish right from wrong, understand the advantages and disadvantages, and clearly see the evils of the bandit traitors. What can be comforted to all my compatriots in Changchun is that with the strong strength and firm fighting spirit of our Changchun garrison, coupled with the "fortress group defense line" as strong as steel, it is sufficient to ensure that the city of Changchun is impregnable. Moreover, we rely on our Air Force squadron to always maintain the air supply line for the military and civilians of Changchun, to crush Mao's bandits' plan to blockade and encircle Changchun, and finally achieve the goal of restoring land transportation in Changchun."

### Wedemeyer, Hoffman, et al. Appeal for Military and Economic Aid to China to Prevent the Situation from Becoming More Serious

[Our Newspaper News] New York, 13th Radio: The US Senate Appropriations Committee held a secret meeting on the 13th to discuss the issue of reducing aid to China funds. Hoffman, US Secretary of the Army Royal, Bridges and others attended to testify, advocating the restoration of the original figure of 466.3 million US dollars. General Wedemeyer also attended and told the committee that "if you want to stop communism, both military and economic aid to China are needed." Hoffman also said: "In order to prevent the situation in China from worsening, US aid to China is necessary."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th Dispatch] The Senate Appropriations Committee will take action on the 14th on the House of Representatives' reduction of 63 million US dollars from the aid to China plan and other foreign aid funds.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th Dispatch, United Press] General Wedemeyer and Economic Cooperation Administration official Hoffman asked Congress to provide "separate" large-scale military and economic assistance to China. They appealed to Senator Bridges, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, as the Senate Appropriations Committee is considering reducing the amount of foreign aid. Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, was invited to the committee meeting room, but did not speak to the committee. The attendance of a foreign ambassador at a Senate Appropriations Committee is an extraordinary event. Gu told reporters that he had no intention of making a statement before the committee. When asked whether the US government's requested $570 million in aid to China for 15 months would help curb inflation in China, he replied: Any goods supplied to China will ease the pressure of inflation. Bridges said after holding a closed-door meeting that Wedemeyer and Hoffman had strongly stated that the situation in China was critical, and that economic and military aid to China was necessary in order to prevent communism. Bridges also said: Hoffman assured the committee that he would select outstanding and capable people to manage aid to China, while strongly calling for the restoration of the funds recommended by the House to be reduced. Bridges said: A major problem is urgently awaiting resolution. We must maintain our goals in China so that the situation does not become more serious. The House of Representatives has canceled some of the funds earmarked by the Senate for military assistance to China, and stipulated that all aid to China should be handled in the same way as the anti-communism plan implemented in Greece and Turkey.

Editorial

### Beware of Fire!

As we enter summer, the climate is extremely hot, and disease and fire have become the two major worries in urban society. To prevent the occurrence and spread of disease, we must emphasize hygiene; to prevent the occurrence and damage of fire, we must emphasize fire prevention, especially for the general public to be consciously aware and beware of fire. After the major fire at the Zhongfa Warehouse on Henan Road on the 5th, another fire broke out on Sichuan Middle Road yesterday morning. Regarding the fire on Henan Road, it has been confirmed that 59 innocent citizens were killed or injured, and nearby shops and newspaper offices were also affected, resulting in particularly heavy losses. Regarding yesterday morning's fire, the casualties and losses are still under investigation. At the same time, the municipal government is also thoroughly investigating the cause of the Zhongfa Warehouse fire from an administrative perspective; the District Procuratorate is investigating the criminal responsibility of the Zhongfa Warehouse from a judicial perspective; and the port authorities are studying the safety of storing flammable materials from a regulatory perspective. These post-incident investigations indicate that no one is taking responsibility administratively or legally, but instead using "thorough investigation," "investigation," and "research" to shirk responsibility, leaving the dead and injured to suffer injustice and the victims with no way to seek compensation. This accidental loss will probably be difficult to redress and provide relief for.

After the major fire on Wuding Road last spring and the burning of the Maochang Company warehouse on Nanxun Road, this newspaper successively issued urgent calls to "Beware of Fire," arousing the attention of the municipal authorities and the general public, hoping that the authorities and the public, based on a sense of caution and fear, would consciously and proactively prepare for fire prevention. Unfortunately, in the past year, fires have increased from time to time, and the lives and property of all residents of the city have been threatened and persecuted by fire. This is the misfortune of Shanghai's urban society. According to the fire statistics released by the city's fire department, the number of fire alarms from January to the end of November last year reached as many as 1,129, and the figures for these eleven months exceeded the records of any previous year. The reasons for this are roughly divided into the following points: (1) The population has increased to five million, with concentrated housing; (2) Poor construction, unchecked electrical wiring, lack of a sense of responsibility among the general public, and a lack of emphasis on the preservation of residential housing; (3) The use of flammable liquids for cooking at home, which is most likely to cause fires; (4) Warehouses are located in urban areas, and chemical and flammable materials are abundant in the warehouses; (5) Unregulated loading and unloading of goods at ports and wharves, and failure to implement safety inspections; (6) The deplorable state of fire-fighting equipment. According to Director Yu Shuping, the major fire at the Zhongfa Warehouse on Henan Road was caused by the smuggling of 20 large barrels of film. This kind of waste film is made of nitrocellulose raw materials, which are extremely flammable. If exposed to the sun or heat, it will produce flammability and cause a serious explosion with a large amount of gas.

From the above analysis, it can be seen that the causes of the past major fires in Shanghai are mostly chemical hazardous materials, and the locations are mostly warehouses. Now, in order to prevent problems before they occur, and to address the root cause, we are willing to reiterate the call to "Beware of Fire," hoping that the municipal authorities will take swift and active measures to prevent fires from an administrative perspective, targeting the causes of past major fires, while also arousing the vigilance and responsibility of all citizens and merchants, turning disasters into blessings and eliminating troubles in the invisible. As for the methods of preventing fires, the technical aspects need to be studied by municipal and fire experts. We only put forward the following points in principle:

First, warehouses in the central and residential areas of Shanghai should be completely moved out. All warehouse inventories should be subject to safety inspections. The Zhongfa Warehouse's storage of dangerous goods violated the "Shanghai Municipal Regulations for the Management of the Transportation of Dangerous Goods," which was a failure of inspection by the police and public utility departments; last year's chemical explosion at the China Merchants Bureau Wharf was a dereliction of duty by the port authorities. At present, there are numerous agencies in Shanghai that regulate warehouses and transportation. On the municipal administrative side, there are the Public Utilities Bureau and the Police Bureau; on the financial administrative side, there are the Jianghai Customs and the Financial Administration Bureau; on the military affairs side, there are the Joint Logistics Headquarters and the Port Headquarters; and on the commercial side, there are the Wharf and Warehouse Liaison Bureau and the Warehouse Trade Association. The administrative system is fragmented and the management methods are difficult to comprehensively address, which is inevitable. In the future, we should seek the unification of management and gradually move public and private warehouses away from urban areas to ensure safety.

Second, since the eight-year war, the electrical materials and equipment in public and private buildings in Shanghai have mostly become outdated. Once exposed to moisture, they are prone to electrical leakage. Therefore, electrical wiring inspections and safety inspections of electrical equipment in companies, firms, and homes should be carried out as soon as possible.

Third, the use of flammable liquids in households should be restricted. Many small and medium-sized families in Shanghai use liquid fuels. Some cause fires during cooking, while others store flammable materials that lead to fires. In particular, the use of kerosene for cooking is more likely to cause fires than gasoline. The municipal authorities should impose reasonable restrictions and bans. In fact, for the sake of the lives and property of the vast majority of citizens, it is necessary to restrict and ban flammable liquids.

Fourth, Shanghai has a dense population, much of which is not needed for the productive sectors. From a socio-economic policy perspective, we should strive to disperse the population on the one hand and restrict the influx of population on the other, to avoid the concentration of the urban population. At present, the most important measures, such as banning mezzanine floors and preventing various buildings that are not conducive to fire prevention, are very necessary.

The above points are only from an administrative perspective; as for the citizens, it is hoped that everyone will establish a sense of responsibility, cultivate an automatic and conscious spirit of self-government, and with a cautious mindset and a fearful life, engage in fire prevention in their actions at all times, so that fires can be prevented before they ignite.

### The Situation in the Liaoxi Corridor

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Han Qingtao

[Dispatch from Jinzhou, This Newspaper, 10th] Although the situation in Liaoxi, centered on Jinzhou, has not developed much today, it is playing a magnificent role in consolidating the two ports and one line, and undertaking the task of integrating land, sea, and air, to counter the Communist bandits' tactics of "encircling points" and "cutting lines." The so-called two ports are Huludao and Taihuangdao, and the one line is the Beining Road, which connects transportation inside and outside the pass. In addition, the continuous hum of engines in the sky above Jinzhou is precisely the air transport that connects Shenyang with the sea and land inside and outside the pass.

Air transport, although not powerful enough, transports flour, ammunition, and clothing shipped to Jinzhou by sea and rail, one plane at a time, to Shenyang. Shenyang's goods for export, such as bristles and special steel, are also transported to Jinzhou and exported. The 50-minute flight between Jin and Shen, coupled with the long summer days, allows each plane to make more than four round trips. The question is how to maximize its effectiveness.

Next, let's look at the situation of the bandit and national armies in Liaoxi. The main area is the zone from Fuxin in the north to Suizhong in the south. The bandits have deployed a Ninth Column, confronting the national army across the Daling River. On the military map, a large circle is drawn here, indicating that this bandit force occupies and controls a considerable area. The bandit headquarters is in Beizhen, the 25th Division is south of Dahu Mountain, the 26th Division is stationed in Goubangzi, and the 27th Division is in Luyangyi, a key point on the highway between Beizhen and Goubangzi. This large circle, starting from Heishan in the north and ending at the east bank of the Daling River in the south, cuts off and suffocates the flow of pulses and blood between Jinzhou and Shenyang.

Yixian is the northernmost point of the Liaoxi Corridor. The railway line has been destroyed and is closed to traffic. In the area west and east of the railway, on the Junchuan Dihang, seven or eight small circles are drawn west of the railway, which are the four regiments of local bandit forces of the first, second, third, and sixth districts of the bandit 21st Military Region, as well as the "92nd Detachment" and the "Jin-Yi Detachment," etc. In addition, there is a bandit force of more than 3,000 claiming to be the "Third Division." There is a Fourth Regiment east of the railway, and more than 200 mounted bandits, roaming and harassing.

Yixian was originally the point where two railway lines branched out and met. One line going west from there is the Jingu Road from Jinzhou to Chengde or Gubeikou, and the other going northeast from there is the Xinyi Road from Yixian to Xinlitun. Yixian is a stronghold of the national army, while the bandit 21st Military Region is in the Beipiao area.

West of Jinzhou, in the area of Hongluoxian and Bijia Mountain, there are two small circles. In Hongluoxian, it is the "First Regiment of the 18th Military Region" of the bandits, and Bijia Mountain is the "Liaoxi Brigade." Further west, there are two more small circles, one is Gangyaoling, where the command post of the bandit 18th Military Region is located, and the other circle is the area of ​​Shanshen Temple and Boliwa, where the bandits have a Second Regiment.

West of Jinxi, there are two small circles, which are Yangjiazhangzi, which contains abundant chromium ore. The bandit "Jinxi Detachment" occupies that place. The railway from there to Jinxi is already closed. Originally, the Jinxi Cement Plant transported stones from here. Looking further southwest, in the "Jianchang" area west of Xingcheng, the bandit "Xingcheng Detachment" occupies it, and in the "Kuanbang" area west of Suizhong, it is the bandit "Suizhong Detachment."

In the area west of the railway from Jinzhou to Shanhaiguan, the mountains are continuous, which is beneficial to the bandits. Almost every stronghold of the national army has a bandit local detachment facing each other from afar. The east side of the railway, close to the coast, is quite peaceful.

In the area farther west of the railway between Jinxi and Xingcheng, the Bandit Independent Eighth Division, which owns the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th regiments, is located in the area belonging to Jianchang County. There is also a "Mongolian Cavalry Detachment" here. Yaowangmiao, east of Jianchang, is the location of the "18th Military Region Commissioner's Office" and the bandit "Jiandong County Government," and a "Jiandong Detachment" is stationed there. To its west, in Daxi Mountain, there is a small bandit arsenal with 1,800 male workers and 200 female workers, producing more than 1,000 grenades a day, and also making bullets.

Looking at the bandit army in Liaoxi between Fuxin and Suizhong as a whole, the Ninth Column east of the Daling River and the Independent Eighth Division east of Jianchang are both regular field armies of the bandits. Some mounted bandits are also relatively fierce, and the remaining "regiments" with 1,000 people and "detachments" with 500-600 people are local troops. Some people call them local "Eighth Route Army." Counting the regular and local bandits together, there are only 30,000 to 40,000 people. Among them, the local troops lack weapons, ammunition, and combat experience, but the organization and political training are relatively strong.

From Yixian in the east to Qinhuangdao in the west, the national army has a total of four major armies, in addition to temporary divisions, traffic police, and some newly trained troops, plus local teams, the military strength can be called strong.

If the bandits attack the Liaoxi Corridor with more than five columns, the national army in Shenyang will inevitably launch an attack. According to the bandit's operational principle of "not fighting if they can't win," they dare not easily attack fortifications. However, the national army cannot prevent the destruction of transportation. Short-term disruption of transportation is possible, especially when the rainy season comes. The construction of bridges after destruction and the inability to pass under the river again increase the difficulties for the road.

The issue of political cooperation between the military and the people needs to be improved urgently. Many people express dissatisfaction with the army because some troops ask the people for food, trees, meat, chickens, and money. The reporter heard many people say: "Every time the Eighth Route Army comes to cause trouble, the people suffer, as if the people brought the bandits in. Beating and forcing makes the people neither one thing or another. Anyone with a little ability avoids the area and flees in all directions. Those who can't do anything have to endure it. As a result, many local ruffians control the local power and act recklessly." In response to this bad reality, we should take a force to correct and improve it!

### Commemorating the Changwei Campaign, Mourning the Soldiers and Civilians Who Died, Tears and Lamentations Flow Together, Wang Yaowu Delivers a Solemn Speech

[Dispatch from Jinan, This Newspaper, 12th (Delayed)] At 9:00 am on the 12th, various sectors of Shandong jointly held a memorial service for the late Committee Member Zhang Tianzuo and the soldiers and civilians who died in the Changwei-Zibo Campaign with the deepest grief. More than a thousand people attended, presided over by Wang Yaowu himself, who delivered a speech in an extremely solemn tone. "In this Changwei Campaign, the late Committee Member Zhang sacrificed himself for righteousness and committed suicide. We should all follow the spirit of sacrifice of Martyr Zhang to quell the rebellion. The government and newspapers have significantly rewarded Wang Fenggang's tactics, but our late Committee Member Zhang can be compared to Wang Fenggang. He not only brought honor to his hometown, but also brought pride to Shandong. Therefore, we should follow Martyr Zhang's method and carry forward his spirit." To achieve this goal, Wang decided on the spot to hold a pre-ceremony review meeting at the same location at 8:00 am on the 13th, requiring the attendance of all battalion commanders and above of the local troops. Those who are loyal and brave will be rewarded generously, and those who neglect their superiors, soldiers, and the people will be severely punished without leniency. Subsequently, the Speaker of the Yiyihui and others delivered speeches one after another, which were passionate, tragic, full of sound and tears. At 11:00 am, this historical grand ceremony of "Achievements Remaining for a Thousand Years, Righteousness Inspiring the Three Qis" concluded in a mournful and tearful atmosphere.

### American Experts Gregerson et al. Invited to Participate in the Study of Yang Mei, Dr. Chen Zhiqian Talks About the Testing Work

[Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 13th] Dr. Chen Zhiqian, the former director of the Sichuan Provincial Health Department and the current president of the Central Hospital in Chongqing and concurrently president of the Chongqing Medical College, who recently returned to Chongqing from Nanjing, met with Dr. Liu Ruiheng, the chairman of the American Medical Aid to China, in Shanghai. Liu was also skeptical about Yang Mei's nine years of fasting, but has invited the famous American physiologist Gregerson and his assistant Root to participate in the study of Yang Mei in the future. Gregerson has left the United States and is currently on his way to China, and Root has arrived in Nanjing. They were originally invited to lecture at Central University for a month in July, and will come to Chongqing on August 1 to plan matters related to the physiology department of Chongqing Medical College. Chen confirmed that the preliminary observation methods of Yang Mei by the Health Bureau were not thorough enough. He stated that matter exists permanently, and so far no theory has been found that matter can be produced without matter. Therefore, the study of Yang Mei is not only the responsibility of the medical community, but also requires the participation of researchers who have a deep understanding of this in the scientific community. He expressed disagreement with any doctor who is willing to participate in the examination of Yang Mei and express opinions, because research is a set of knowledge and must be familiar with document records, so that the conclusions they make can be explained without error by other scientists before a judgment can be made. He gave an example to explain that before the war, a certain German physiologist tested the beating of the heart, using instruments to record, in order to prove that the effect of the heart had undergone several tests, and his own records were consistent, and all were different from the records of the past medical community, which caused a global shock and aroused the attention of the scientific community. A group of scientists studied the results of his laboratory and found that the electricity used in his laboratory test was connected to another wire, so that the same wave-like beating record could be obtained without the heart, causing a big joke. Science cannot be monopolized by one person. Before studying Yang Mei, various factors, such as the coordination of time, equipment, and personnel, need to be carefully prepared. Therefore, he advocated that the examination of Yang Mei should be discussed after experts such as Ge and Luo arrive in Chongqing, which is the most appropriate. Before it is proven, do not spread too much rumors. His opinion is consistent with that of Liu Ruiheng, that is, researchers who want to do this kind of work must be familiar with the research object. This cannot be overemphasized by biological nutrition experts. They usually study animal nutrition, and now they have shifted from studying rabbits and mice to Yang Mei. Although the object is different, the method is the same. Observing the phenomenon alone cannot prove the correctness of the research. Zhang Qun was in Chongqing and talked with him in detail about Yang Mei. He emphasized that the test should not have a time limit. Scientific discoveries must not have doubts. If others have doubts about this, it means that there is a problem in this science. Every new scientific discovery cannot be achieved overnight. Even small tests are prone to loopholes, let alone such a major event as Yang Mei.

### Arab League Issues Ultimatum: Requests Cessation of Jewish Violation of Truce; Bernadotte Arrives in Rhodes with Staff; Transjordan King Insists on Establishing Arab Sovereignty in Holy Land

[Reuters, London, 13th Dispatch] UN Palestine Mediator Bernadotte has flown from Tel Aviv to Rhodes in the Aegean Sea on the 13th, where he will establish his headquarters. Before his departure, Bernadotte stated that his sixty-three truce observers would arrive on the front lines within forty-eight hours. Small-scale conflicts were expected during the initial truce period, but the situation is expected to improve after the arrival of the truce observers.

[Reuters, Damascus, 13th Dispatch] Syrian Prime Minister Marden announced that before UN Palestine Mediator Bernadotte left Damascus for Tel Aviv today, he had been presented with a joint note from Arab countries stating that if the Jewish side did not strictly comply with the ceasefire order before 11:00 AM standard time on the 13th, the Arab armies would launch a general offensive on all fronts. Meanwhile, Syrian officials announced today that Jewish forces violated the ceasefire order again on the night of the 12th, attacking Malki on the Lebanese border, and in another location, one Syrian soldier was killed by Jewish forces.

[Reuters, Beirut, 13th Dispatch] The Lebanese government today presented UN Mediator Bernadotte with a note protesting the violation of the ceasefire order by Jewish armored units, which attacked Lebanese defense lines seventeen kilometers northeast of Nazareth twice on Saturday, and stated that the Lebanese government reserves all rights regarding this matter.

[Reuters, Damascus, 12th Dispatch] Reliable sources report: UN Mediator Bernadotte has submitted a three-page coded report to the Security Council regarding the ceasefire situation in the Holy Land, in which he accuses the Jewish side of bearing the main responsibility for violating the ceasefire order. Before leaving Damascus for Tel Aviv today, Bernadotte said, "I have a plan in mind to deal with the violation of the ceasefire order, but it is not yet time to announce it. I hope that the acts of violating the ceasefire can be stopped, but I do not intend to make a hasty judgment before hearing the other party's explanation." An enemy plane appeared over Damascus again last night, and the alert was lifted only after three hours and fifteen minutes.

[Reuters, Amman, 12th Dispatch] Transjordan King Abdullah issued a declaration today, stating that if a unified Arab-Jewish state is established in Palestine, the people of Transjordan will not oppose the participation of Arabs.

The Arab armies entered Palestine to restore peace and order in the area, and are now ready to negotiate with the Jewish people to resolve the Palestine issue. If the Jewish people agree to belong to the Arab state of Palestine, the Arabs are prepared to grant full citizenship rights and even allow them autonomy within the region.

### British Foreign Secretary Prepares to Visit Germany: To Deliver Speech Hoping Germany Rejoins the International Community

[Central News Agency, London, 13th Dispatch] The Sunday Observer exclusively published today that the Foreign Secretary is planning to visit Germany, which will be Bevin's first visit to Germany after the Potsdam Conference. It is believed that he wants to personally investigate how to implement the London Agreement and to what extent the joint occupation zone has successfully assisted West Germany in the reconstruction of Europe. Bevin may depart for Germany after the French Parliament approves the London Agreement.

[Reuters, Sheffield, England, 12th Dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin delivered a public speech here, advocating giving Germany the opportunity to rejoin the international community as a member. His hope for Germany is that it can coexist peacefully with its neighbors by peaceful means rather than by using swords. He expressed regret that the post-war European problems have not yet been resolved, but expressed satisfaction that progress has been made in organizing Western Europe.

Hoping for Jewish-Arab Truce

Regarding the Palestine issue, he hopes that the Jewish and Arab peoples of Palestine can find a solution, as both are Semitic peoples and only differ in religious beliefs. Therefore, there should not be an unsolvable problem between Jews and Arabs to achieve peaceful coexistence.

War Debt of 20 Billion Pounds

Referring to the European Recovery Program and the cost of the war, he said that Britain has spent a huge amount of money on the war and has a debt of 20 billion pounds. If Britain calculates the money spent from the beginning to the end of the war, the expenses Britain has obtained under the European Recovery Program are only a very small part of what Britain has already spent. In short, the only hope now is that war will not happen again, in which case the pound debt and war debt will not occur.

### Romania Recognizes Israel

### Truce Observers in Holy Land Conduct On-Site Investigation

[Reuters, London, 12th Dispatch] Twenty-four hours after the ceasefire order came into effect, the fighting in Palestine had not yet stopped. The Jewish side reported that Arab forces launched an offensive south of the Sea of Galilee, while the Syrian army also claimed that Jewish forces attacked the southern part of the Syrian defense line. UN ceasefire observers have rushed to both locations to investigate. According to a dispatch from Haifa, Colonel Sphalival, the senior UN truce supervisor and personal advisor to Bernadotte, flew from Haifa to Damascus today to investigate the fighting on the Palestine-Syria border. The remaining truce observers went to the Sea of Galilee area to investigate the Jewish claim that Arab forces attacked the Jewish settlement of Ein Gev on the lake.

A dispatch from Washington said that the United States has agreed to provide Bernadotte's truce monitoring group with three patrol boats and three aircraft.

A British Foreign Office spokesman confirmed that Bernadotte has requested that Britain provide the sea and air transport tools needed by the truce observers, but the spokesman said that he did not believe that British personnel would participate in Bernadotte's truce monitoring group or the Jewish-Arab peace talks held on Rhodes.

### Western Allies Launch New Political Offensive in Germany: Aimed at Forming a Unified German Government

[United Press, Berlin, 13th Dispatch] The Western countries have launched their first large-scale political offensive against the Soviet Union in Germany since the war, with the aim of not only politically winning over West Germany, but also winning over all of Germany, including Soviet-controlled East Germany. The Soviet Union's response to this offensive may determine whether there will be a risk of war between the East and West sides soon. In short, that is the meaning of the London Six-Power Conference.

It is generally believed that since the Soviet Union did not attend the London Conference, the federal government established by the conference's resolutions will only be limited to the occupation zones of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. However, officials have stated that there is no such restriction. On the contrary, Germans will be encouraged to establish a government with the authority to represent all of Germany. According to US military governor Clay yesterday, the Frankfurt government intends to include as much of Germany as possible, and there is no reason to say that it cannot represent East Germany. At the same time, almost all German political leaders oppose the establishment of a government limited to West Germany. Some people advocate that representatives from the eastern occupation zone should also participate in the future cabinet.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 12th Dispatch] US Military Governor of Germany General Clay said at a press conference today, "The currency reform plan for the western occupation zone has not yet been finalized. After obtaining this decision, we will immediately notify the Soviet side. It has not yet been determined whether West Berlin should be included in this reform." Referring to the six-power agreement on Germany, Clay said, "We are not forcing the German people" to establish a West German government. We hope that the German people can have a responsible government to solve their own problems. However, they have absolute freedom to choose the way and date of establishing the government." When a reporter asked why the US military removed the German locomotive from the Anhalt station, Clay replied that the locomotive was very valuable and needed to be protected. The US authorities did not want to take it away from Germany, but the US military would provide it with the necessary protection.

### Various Countries Oppose US Support for Japan: US Authorities Feel Very Tricky; State Department Seeks to Eliminate Concerns

[United Press, Washington, 12th Dispatch] Authoritative sources said on the 12th that the United States is planning to intensify its propaganda to explain its policy towards Japan to other countries. For several weeks, US officials have been increasingly concerned about protests from China and other countries regarding the US plan to restore the Japanese economy to a relatively high level. They believe that unless countermeasures are taken, relations between the United States and its former allies will become tense, making cooperation more difficult. The State Department also intends to dispel the concerns of those who believe that Japan's prosperity will threaten world peace again. The technique is to propose environment and security, which US officials believe are sufficient to demonstrate that Japan cannot threaten peace again.

### French Parliament Continues to Debate West German Agreement: Bidault Encounters Difficulties; Left-Wing Members Spare No Effort in Attacking the Government

[Reuters, Paris, 12th Dispatch] The National Assembly's debate on the London Six-Power Conference Agreement has reached its second day. Apart from a speech by Foreign Minister Bidault, no one else has expressed support. The dull atmosphere in the chamber has made observers doubt that the government will be able to obtain parliamentary approval of the six-power agreement when the debate is resumed. What most stimulated the government was that when Bidault delivered his speech, only members of the Popular Republican Party and a few moderates occasionally applauded, while when former Minister of Aviation Godde, a left-wing member, spoke out to reject the London Conference proposal, there were repeated enthusiastic applause.

When Godde mentioned that "if we say 'yes'," although it will make our country's relations with Britain and the United States easier to deal with in a short period of several weeks, the difficulties later will inevitably increase day by day, applause erupted from every corner of the hall. Godde also said, "If we say 'yes' to this resolution that disregards the legitimate demands of Nazi victims, then we will inevitably say 'yes' forever in the future. We must not think that the acquisition of Marshall Aid depends on our country's approval of the six-power proposal. If this is indeed the case, it can prove that someone is criticizing the United States' motivation for launching Marshall Aid, and there is indeed something to it. If we say 'no', then the entire European recovery problem can be reconsidered on a broader and better basis, rather than just becoming a politically motivated action in the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union. I hope that Europe can respond to this six-power proposal with a 'no', and it is okay to use diplomatic rhetoric to respond with a 'no' in the most polite way, but our attitude must remain firm." Some observers believe that after two days of parliamentary debate on the matter, the impression that the six-power proposal is unfavorable to France has been formed across the country. Even Socialist Party Secretary-General Philip has stated that the Socialist Party intends to obtain more guarantees before deciding to support the government. Bidault's speech yesterday, which lasted two hours, only confirmed that the only effective one-official Ruhr system that France supported has been rejected by the London Conference, and Bidault has admitted that there is no clear guarantee of Western Europe's military security.

In the current ideological and spiritual struggle of mankind, only those with strong beliefs can achieve victory.

### Churchill's Roar: Condemns Labour Cabinet

[United Press, London, 12th Dispatch] Opposition leader Churchill said in a speech at a Conservative Party gathering today: He felt that "if the current government's life is extended, then we will fall into an irredeemable crisis." Churchill accused Britain of relying on the United States as a "terrible fact." He said; he originally hoped that the US loan obtained in 1945 could enable Britain to tide over the transition from war to peace, and allow Britain to have a breathing opportunity after wartime poverty in order to reorganize its businesses. But the loan has been wasted in two years, forcing us to rely on the "generosity" of the United States again. At the same time, we are constantly depleting our remaining overseas investments and the assets accumulated under the capitalist system in the past to the point of exhaustion.

If the Labour government continues to govern, the most capable and resourceful Britons will emigrate abroad, and all that will remain in the country is a group of officials and a large number of starving people. Our position in the world will not only completely lose our personal self-esteem, but also the independence of the country will not be guaranteed.

### New Medical Invention: Atomic Needles to Treat Cancer

[United Press, New York, 12th Dispatch] Scientific Daily reported: The medical community has invented the atomic needle method for treating cancer. The needle is made of cobalt and nickel. After being exercised in an atomic pile or atomic furnace for a short time, it is taken out, and the needle emits light similar to radium needles, but is more powerful. Atomic needles can be made into a curved shape to suit the condition, which radium needles cannot. Also, radium needles are hollow needles, filled with radon gas, which sometimes leaks, endangering the patient's body. Atomic needles are solid needles, without this danger. Atomic needles have magnetic properties and can be used with a magnet as a handle, while radium needles must be clamped with titanium tweezers.

### City Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram to the Legislative Yuan Opposing the Levy of Property Tax, Believing that Investigating Wealthy Families and Rectifying Tax Administration Can Already Restrain Capital and Equalize Wealth

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in response to news reports that the Legislative Yuan is discussing a draft of the Provisional Property Tax Regulations, which, if passed and implemented, will inevitably lead to various abuses, sent a special telegram to the Legislative Yuan, detailing the reasons why the tax is untenable, believing that only by investigating wealthy families and rectifying tax administration can capital be restrained and wealth equalized.

The original telegram stated: "To the esteemed Legislative Yuan in Nanjing: It is reported that forty-nine members of the Legislative Yuan, including Liu Butong, have proposed a draft of the Provisional Property Tax Regulations, intending to use surplus to make up for deficiencies, balance wealth, and supplement national expenditures. We deeply admire this far-sighted plan. However, we believe that the proposal to levy property tax originated when the government moved to the provisional capital, during the intense period of the War of Resistance, when foreign aid was insufficient, and military needs were extremely urgent. At that time, wealthy families and magnates, relying on their power and influence, took advantage of the national crisis to develop their private property, seizing opportunities and benefiting from all sides. The intention of the proponents was to reduce the harsh taxes and express national indignation. This was indeed a move to prescribe the right medicine for the ailment. Unfortunately, the power of public opinion was like a mayfly trying to shake a tree. Those who were targeted by thousands had already taken their assets and left the country freely. The original proposal had to be slightly changed, from property tax to National Reconstruction Special Contribution, and then to Relief Special Contribution, starting with persuasion and then moving to fundraising. The targets of the fundraising were trade associations or hometown associations, and the fundraising standard was personal property worth 5 billion yuan or more, levied at one-tenth. Targeting trade associations meant that the levy fell not on wealthy families but on industry and commerce. Setting the starting point at 5 billion yuan, according to the pre-war rice price ratio, was only equivalent to 6,000 or 7,000 yuan in the 25th year of the Republic [1936]. Therefore, the target of the levy was not focused on the very rich but was widespread among the moderately affluent. This property tax, which is different in name but the same in substance and has already changed its nature, is being implemented in Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, Chengdu, Guangzhou, and other places. The Provisional Property Tax is intended as a temporary measure to address extraordinary national circumstances, levied once to supplement deficits. There is no reason for the former to be in the process of implementation while the latter follows one after another. Compared to regular taxes such as income tax, which is levied only once a year, this is even more burdensome. Such a situation contradicts the original intention of the so-called 'provisional' in the Provisional Property Tax. Our Chamber dares to respectfully present this to your esteemed Yuan and to correct the public's perception. Today's industrial and commercial enterprises have either moved to the rear, contributing to the national war effort and enduring the hardships of relocation and displacement for eight years, or have suffered robbery by the enemy and puppet regimes during the period of occupation. Although they have barely managed to salvage the remains, due to the turbulence of the situation, the obstruction of transportation, the decline in people's purchasing power, and the increasing severity of national control laws, they are struggling to survive, barely managing to make ends meet. In terms of national obligations, in addition to paying increasingly heavy commodity taxes, business taxes, business license taxes, profit-seeking enterprise income taxes, special excessive profit taxes, and various local taxes, city defense donations, and pacification donations, other public welfare and charitable donations, winter relief, troop support, and scholarship donations, which are the responsibility of industry and commerce to share, amount to dozens of cases each year. The names of these are created at any time, and it is difficult to list them all in the records. In particular, the banking and textile industries are generally noticed, and donations are often listed at the top. In fact, in recent years, the banking industry has been subject to regulations as dense as hairs, and business constraints are numerous, which is beyond what most people can imagine. Moreover, due to the dispersion of funds, the current capital of two or three hundred banks and firms is not even comparable to that of a large-scale bank before the war. Their financial strength is weak, far beyond what most people expect. The textile industry, on the other hand, faces high labor costs, severe shortages of raw materials, and shrinking sales, and its difficulties are unprecedented. These situations are known only to those who experience them and cannot be easily explained to outsiders. If, after industry and commerce have been drained, they are forced to pay heavy and overlapping property taxes, it is expected that in the future they will only be able to use factory buildings, land, machinery, and equipment as in-kind payments to offset their tax burden. The result will be to promote capital flight, business bankruptcy, and a large-scale suspension of production. Tax revenue will inevitably decrease, and unemployment will inevitably increase. Although the current measure may be pleasing for a time, winning the joy and praise of some people, the serious consequences are not worth the gain. It will only allow wealthy families to laugh secretly on the sidelines, while industry and commerce, which are considered the middle class of the country, will decline from this point on. Considering the standpoint of national politics, this is also truly uneasy. General public opinion often says that levying property tax can curb private monopoly capital. In fact, taking the salt loans, cocoon loans, and tea loans of recent years as examples, merchants rely entirely on loans from national banks and bureaus to purchase goods. Private monopoly capital has long declined, and state capital is gradually forming. There is factual evidence to this effect. The arguments made by commentators are almost unfounded. We believe that the most dangerous phenomenon in recent years is the divergence between the will of the state and the people. The people criticize the authorities for 'misgovernment,' while the authorities criticize the people for 'lack of conscience.' Moreover, within the people, opinions are clearly divided. Scholars criticize industry and commerce for only seeking their own self-interest, while industry and commerce criticize scholars for not understanding the people's hardships. If we do not sincerely seek the root cause of these mutual recriminations, we fear that we will repeat the mistakes of the past, where 'what arises in the heart harms the government.' Discord at the court, the repeat of the late Ming dynasty's downfall, is truly worrying. The property tax issue is just one aspect of this. Our Chamber, from the standpoint of 'coming from the fields,' assesses the overall situation and offers this humble opinion, not only to plead for the interests of industry and commerce, but because the currently proposed Provisional Property Tax has lost the original essence of the property tax, and is different in name but the same in substance as the Relief Special Contribution, which is currently being levied. One tax is levied twice. Moreover, the levy procedures and the encouragement of reporting and the issuance of tax payment certificates in the original draft, if implemented, will inevitably cause national turmoil, with everyone living in fear. The abuses that will result are unbearable to speak of. In short, from any point of view, this proposal has no reason to exist. We respectfully ask your esteemed Yuan to adopt public opinion and reject it, as this would be in the public interest. Our Chamber has further suggestions. The state's financial deficit has reached this point, and relying solely on issuing currency to meet immediate needs is like drinking poison to quench thirst. Before the thirst is quenched, the person will die. Who among the citizens is not worried? Therefore, planning to increase revenue and balance the budget is the most urgent task. Currently, the concentration of wealth does not lie in industry and commerce, but in the hands of a few wealthy families with special privileges. We have heard that members of your esteemed Legislative Yuan have proposed organizing a committee to investigate the assets of wealthy families. If you can resolutely and thoroughly continue the unfinished business of the former National Political Council, then you will find the pearl without harming the national vitality and benefiting the annual revenue. In the past, the Chu Prime Minister destroyed his family to relieve the national crisis, and ultimately revived the state of Chu. Noble families should follow the example of their predecessors. Different eras, same principles. This would further inspire people's feelings and be forever prayed for and cherished by the people. This is the first point. Restraining capital and balancing wealth is the only way for modern countries to avoid economic revolution. It is only a matter of proper implementation, without the need to create too many names, which would disturb the local communities and only enrich corrupt officials. The accumulation of private capital, tracing its origin, is nothing more than owning land, engaging in profit-making businesses, securities deposits, and property rentals. Accumulating small amounts into large sums gradually leads to manipulation and control. Today, the Land Law already has progressive taxation on land appreciation. Profit-making businesses, securities deposits, and property rentals, in addition to being subject to classified income tax, are also subject to comprehensive income tax, and the tax rates are progressively levied. All of these are the methods used by modern countries to achieve the goal of balancing wealth through the tax system. Our country also has everything it should have, but either the matter is still in its initial stages, or its implementation is not widespread, or the investigation is not thorough, and the agencies are numerous, the powers are dispersed, the discipline is lax, and the effectiveness is weak. The personnel system is not perfect, and all the tools cannot be coordinated. To correct the previous malpractices, it is necessary to reduce the number of taxes, simplify the tax system, identify key points, and refresh personnel, in order to achieve the original goal of thoroughly making up for the budget and balancing wealth. Some commentators say that the current tax system can only exploit the common people and cannot suppress the wealthy, and therefore they want to establish a property tax to remedy this. In fact, the current tax laws in our country, such as the salt tax, which is increased multiple times, the wheat flour tax, which is under consideration, and the food and entertainment tax, do indeed have the effect of increasing the burden on the common people. If the entire tax system is said to be helping the rich and exploiting the poor, and one wants to establish a property tax to seek innovation, then this is purely clinging to one side, and is an overly激动的词语 [激动的词语 = "emotionally charged language"]. If the current shortcomings in tax collection cannot be eliminated, then more taxes will only lead to more abuses, which will not benefit the national treasury as before. Factory buildings, land, machinery, and equipment will become the targets of taxation. Instead of collecting taxes on their surplus profits, they will actually be collecting taxes on their means of production. It is feared that after one property tax, capital will flee and production will cease. Various commodity taxes, classified income taxes, and comprehensive income taxes will be greatly reduced. It is feared that the state's taxation targets will only be concentrated on the majority of the common people, and the burden on the common people will become even heavier, which is the opposite of what the commentators are worried about. This is the second point. We believe that this case concerns the major plan of the country. If a decision is made hastily, it will only complicate matters further. Your esteemed Yuan is a public opinion agency, and you should listen to the different opinions of the people's organizations as much as possible, to show your humility and tolerance. Therefore, we do not mind being verbose and repeatedly offering our advice. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits this document."

### Newspaper Workers Request Rice Rationing, Civilian Affairs Committee Still Has Not Replied

According to the Newspaper Workers' Union, the Civilian Affairs Committee's preferential rice rationing for news professionals did not include members of this union. A document was submitted to the Civilian Affairs Committee on the 5th of this month requesting equal rationing, and the union has not yet received a response from the committee. However, recent newspaper reports have stated that the rationing was sometimes canceled, sometimes misrepresented, and sometimes restored. These reports lack substance and cannot be relied upon. The union is currently awaiting a reply from the Civilian Affairs Committee to determine the true situation. Furthermore, the Peiping Newspaper and Printing Workers' Union has also expressed sympathy and support for this union's protest, as the rice rationing for news professionals does not include printing workers.

### Mingyuanfang Tenant Association Submits Petition to the Garrison Command, Requesting to Stop Soldiers from Forcibly Occupying Civilian Housing

Mingyuanfang, 772 Longyang Road in this city, was colluded with by the traitor Han Youshun and Japanese chiefs Kubota and Kubodera during the enemy and puppet period (May 1943), who used Japanese military police force to expel all residents and seize the houses for Jewish refugees to live in. After the victory, the original residents organized the "Mingyuanfang Tragedy Victim Tenant Association," registered as refugees, and petitioned the municipal government and all parties to restore their residence. After repeated negotiations with the American Jewish Association by the municipal government, it took three years, until March 1947, to send the Jewish people back to their countries in batches, and order the original residents of the neighborhood to restore their original homes in batches, reaching three-quarters. Now there are only eleven Jewish buildings left, which will be evacuated recently. However, starting from the 1st of this month, unarmed soldiers have successively invaded the Jewish houses in the name of various military institutions and are occupying them. The Jewish people cannot resist and reported to their representatives for negotiation, but there was no result. The Tenant Association has recently submitted a petition to the Garrison Command, making a complaint, hoping that the authorities will find a reasonable solution.

### The Complicated Inside Story of Ji Juemi's Family Dispute: Suffering from Polygamy, Disputes Arising from Property; Indentured Children Seek Father to Maintain Their Livelihoods; Mother and Son Being Sued May Lead to Further Complications

[Our Newspaper Report] On the 7th of this month, this newspaper published a news item titled "Ji Juemi's Family Dispute: Lawsuit Against Two Defendants, Male and Female." This news appeared ordinary and simple, and perhaps did not attract much attention. However, it contains an extraordinarily complex and intriguing story. Those familiar with the inside story predict that this property damage case may be the precursor to a major lawsuit in the years to come.

The news on the 7th described that the defendant, Lu Qing, and her son, Ji Yupeng, went to the residence of the plaintiff, Fan Fumi, on April 26th of this year, seeking her husband but were refused entry. In a moment of anger, they smashed the utensils and glass windows in the kitchen, as well as the car, etc. After investigation, Prosecutor Li Chaozhu concluded that the two defendants were suspected of property damage and filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Division of the District Court.

Although the indictment for the property damage case did not specify who Zhao Luqing's husband was, the reporter had already clarified in the news that this was the family dispute of Ji Juemi, a wealthy Jewish merchant in Hardoon's family. Since Ji's life had an inseparable relationship with Hardoon, Ji's family dispute must also be related to Aili Garden.

Sharing the Same Sorrow: Bodao Without a Son

Hardoon's trust in Ji Juemi during his lifetime was well-known. In Hardoon's eulogy, Ji compared himself to Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya, saying, "Our friendship is like brothers, side by side for thirty years, forming the bond of Guan and Bao, holding mourning attire like Yelü." After Luo Jialing inherited her husband's business, she relied even more heavily on Ji, entrusting him with all the affairs inside and outside Aili Garden. In name, they had already become sworn siblings from being employer and guest. Hardoon and his wife could not have children, having no offspring, male or female. Ji Juemi also had this deficiency. The three of them shared the same sorrow and worried about having heirs. Therefore, they once made a vow to jointly adopt 100 foster children. Although this plan was not fully realized, they did adopt dozens of poor children and orphans at the time. Later, they repeatedly eliminated some. Hardoon adopted four sons and six daughters, who took Hardoon as their surname. Luo Jialing adopted five sons and three daughters, who took Luo as their surname. Ji Juemi adopted four sons, who took Ji as their surname, named Yu Sheng, Yu Long, Yu Qiang, and Yu Peng, respectively. These foster children all called Hardoon "Father," Luo Jialing "Mother," and Ji Juemi "Papa," "Daddy," or "Uncle." Ji Juemi's four sons also grew up in Aili Garden and received the same treatment as other foster children. Luo Jialing also treated them as if they were her own, without any discrimination.

The Outbreak of War Ceased Disputes; Abandoning Grievances, Reconciliation and Settlement Were Reached

Luo Jialing passed away in October of the 30th year of the Republic of China. At that time, two wills appeared, one with George Hardoon as the heir and the other with Ji Juemi as the main heir. Neither side would give in, and they litigated in the British court in Shanghai. Before two months had passed, the Pacific War broke out, and the inheritance lawsuit was virtually suspended. All the遗产 was occupied and managed by the Japanese army. Ji Juemi and George Hardoon abandoned their grievances and reached a settlement. All the foster children received a share of the estate. Ji Juemi obtained real estate such as Cishu Lane on Nanjing Road, Ciyi Lane on Jiujiang Road, and six mu of land along Foch Road in Aili Garden. However, Yu Sheng, Yu Long, Yu Qiang, and Yu Peng, although also foster sons (calling Luo Jialing "Mother"), were not entitled to inherit Luo Jialing's estate due to their status. Moreover, their foster father became increasingly cold towards them and even refused to provide financial support. At the same time, they were gradually not tolerated in Aili Garden. Except for Yu Sheng, who had a good relationship with Luo's brothers and was allowed to stay in the garage in the garden, Yu Long now lives with his family in a small hotel. Yu Qiang and Yu Peng (both unmarried) moved to No. 28, Lane 119, Shaanxi North Road, the residence of Ji Juemi's wife, Wang Chengzheng. Wang is now 44 years old and, during the period of the 14th and 15th years of the Republic of China, lived with Ji Juemi at the same time as the recently sued Ms. Zhao Luqing.

The Ownership of the Main Residence on Nanyang Road Becomes a Problem

In the 31st year of the Republic of China, Ji, through the introduction of the "Tianlu Marriage Agency," met Fan Fumi, the plaintiff in the property damage case, and immediately began cohabiting with her. Since then, Ji only sent a small amount of living expenses to Wang and Zhao each month and never visited them again. Wang was thus stimulated and suffered from mental illness, having been bedridden for several years. However, cherishing old feelings, she was reluctant to break up with Ji. Zhao Luqing, having lost favor with Ji, also intended to sell a residence at No. 145 Nanyang Road last month due to economic difficulties to a Christian gathering place. The buyer entrusted lawyer Fei Xizhen to publish advertisements in the Jiaxin and Liangbao newspapers on May 25th, 26th, and 27th, soliciting objections. On the 28th of the same month, lawyer Zhang Shiying, representing Juemi Trading Company, came forward to intervene, stating that the property was the assets of the company owner acting in the name of the hall, and without the consent of the company owner, no one may assert any claim. According to the reporter's investigation, the garden house residence was purchased by Ji Juemi for Zhao Luqing's residence before the war. The account name at the time of purchase was "Pan Jinle," but there is also a story as to why "Pan" was used instead of "Ji" or "Zhao." It is rumored that Ji Juemi's original surname was "Pan," and his hometown was Tingsu Weining. He changed his surname to Ji after coming to Shanghai. "Jinle" was a nickname given by Ji to Zhao, while Wang Chengzheng also had a nickname, "Fengle." Therefore, Zhao Luqing believes that this main residence is property given to her by Ji, and she has absolute freedom to dispose of it.

Entering Open Strife from Secrecy

Before planning the sale, Zhao had repeatedly sought Ji's opinion, but to no avail. On April 26th, she went to No. 6, Lane 382, Henan Road to find Ji, which led to a conflict with Fan Fumi and caused the property damage case. After this, Zhao Luqing resolutely decided to sell, but Ji Juemi immediately publicly opposed it. Thus, Ji Juemi's family dispute entered open strife from secrecy. Yu Sheng and his four brothers also hired legal counsel early on to negotiate with their foster father, requesting some funds or a job to maintain their livelihoods. However, after this case occurred, the situation changed drastically. Yu Peng and the other three believe that although the plaintiff in the property damage case is Fan Fumi, their father actually has the power to control it. Now, to sue his son and wife for such a trivial matter goes against common sense, and they deeply fear that more unfortunate events will occur. Therefore, they are running around every day, seeking help from relatives, friends, and lawyers, living in constant anxiety.

### Fire on Sichuan Middle Road: Girl Buried in Flames, Young Woman Injured in Fall

[Our Newspaper Report] The Tianxingxiang Western Clothing Store at No. 575 Sichuan Middle Road (south of the YMCA), where a Cantonese woman named Li Ruiqi lived, caught fire at around 6:40 yesterday morning due to a cooking accident. The fire suddenly spread to the dormitory of Baocheng Money Exchange in the front building. At that time, the wind was strong, blowing south, and in an instant, it affected the adjacent three-story residential building of the Huashang Dacheng Industrial and Commercial Society at No. 573, and the third floor of No. 569, all of which were burned down. The second floor of Huatai Bank at No. 569 suffered water damage, with losses of about 20 billion yuan. The three-story residential building of Longsheng Rice Store at Nos. 567-565 was also burned down. A large amount of white rice, about 700-800 dan, stored on the second floor and in the store was waterlogged, resulting in heavy losses. The third floor of Hengkang Woolen Western Clothing Store at No. 563 was also destroyed, and the woolen fabrics stored in the workshop on the second floor and the store on the ground floor were waterlogged, with losses estimated at 50 billion yuan. When the fire was raging, a relative's daughter, Ma Ping (15 years old), was hiding next to the stairs on the upper floor of Tianxingchang Western Clothing Store at No. 575. Later, the gasoline barrel next to the stairs exploded, causing her to be buried in the flames. Her body was charred, and it was unbearable to look at. A young woman, Ma Zhang (23 years old), was casually looking out on the balcony when she suddenly heard the fire alarm. She jumped down, resulting in fractures of her left thigh and left arm. She was then taken to Gongji Hospital by ambulance for treatment. After the fire broke out, the Central Fire Department was notified and immediately dispatched several pump trucks to rush to the scene to put out the fire. Later, Director Yu, Section Chief Zhou, and Captain Zhang arrived at the scene one after another to direct the firefighting. It took more than an hour to put out the fire. At the same time, the Huangpu Police Sub-Bureau, upon hearing the news, dispatched officer Yang Jihang to supervise a large number of uniformed police and plainclothes police to rush to the scene to maintain order. Later, the fire starter, Li Ruiqi, was detained and taken to the bureau to inquire about the cause of the fire for further investigation. It is reported that although the fire only burned down five three-story buildings, the value of those damaged by waterlogging amounted to over 100 billion yuan, making it another tragedy after the fire at Zhongfa Warehouse on Henan Road.

### Fire at Chengfeng Weaving Factory

At around 6:25 yesterday afternoon, the Chengfeng Cotton Weaving Factory at No. 328 Taiyang Temple, Zhabei, suddenly caught fire due to a cigarette butt left in the raw materials. As a result, two factory buildings were burned down, and two workers, Tang Enmin (23 years old) suffered burns to the head, and Zhu Maoliang (36 years old) suffered burns to the back. They were later taken to the scene by the Zhabei Fire Brigade to extinguish the fire, and the injured were sent to Jimin Hospital for treatment.

### Boiler Explosion: Seven Dead or Injured

[Our Newspaper Report] At around 3:50 yesterday afternoon, a boiler in the drying room of the Shenhe Rubber Factory at No. 1032 Kangding Road, West Shanghai, suddenly exploded. Oil splattered everywhere. Xie Deyun, the factory owner's nephew, happened to be nearby and was tragically killed in the explosion. At the same time, six male and female workers were injured. Male worker Xie Shuangquan suffered burns all over his body, and his condition was particularly serious. Female workers Chen Sutian, Chen Caidi, Xu Weixian, Ni Meimei, and Tang Hong were all injured in the face and hands, but fortunately, the injuries were minor. They were then taken to the Labor Hospital for treatment. The Fire Department dispatched a vehicle to the scene and used chemical foam to extinguish the fire, which was successfully put out, averting a major disaster.

### Robbery on Xikang Road Last Night: Seven Gold Rings and a Life Lost

[Our Newspaper Report] Six robbers broke into the Li family at No. 32, Lane 567, Xikang Road, West Shanghai, at around 9:15 last night. Three robbers held firearms, and one robber held a hand grenade, threatening the victim. After about 15 minutes, they robbed seven gold rings. As the robbers were escaping with the stolen goods, Li's daughter, Caiying (23 years old), followed behind and shouted, "Robbers!" This angered the robbers, who turned back and fired a shot, hitting her in the head, causing her brains to splatter and killing her. The victim reported the incident to the Jiangning Police Sub-Bureau, which ordered a large number of police officers to arrive. However, the robbers had already disappeared. The body was taken to the Labor Hospital and then transported to the Jijilu autopsy room to report to the court for an examination.

After thorough discussion, they strived to simplify the land registration procedures within the scope of the law.

### Registration Application Instructions

Under the principle of facilitating property owners' applications, eleven instructions for land registration have been formulated, which are excerpted below: [1] Property owners applying for land registration should publish in the newspaper or provide a guarantee if any of the following circumstances exist: 1.

[2] The qualifications of the guarantor are specified in any of the following: A, the four neighbors of the land, B, reputable shops and the local Baojia chief or district people's representative or local people. [3] Anyone who loses a land practice certificate or ownership certificate must, in addition to providing a guarantee, also publish a statement in the newspaper declaring the loss as invalid. [4] When the area of land applied for registration exceeds two-tenths of the area recorded in the deed, the excess part shall be regarded as state-owned land, but the original occupant shall have priority to pay the price to contract for registration. If they do not pay the price, the excess part shall be reserved as public land.

### General Commodity Prices - Positive News Boosts Buying, Prices Continue to Rise

Following the market performance of the previous weekend, commodity prices at the start of last week saw robust buying driven by positive news. The upward trend continued, with new highs frequently reached, and strong momentum persisted until the weekend, indicating another wave of price increases had arrived. While authorities are striving for urgent measures, strengthening controls, and tightening credit, they are struggling to counteract opposing forces, which dilute the impact of these measures, making it difficult to achieve effective results despite earnest efforts.

The wholesale price index compiled by this publication rose by 21.55% last week. Throughout the week, credit conditions remained loose. The clearing situation at the Central Bank showed a net inflow of over 1.3 trillion on Thursday due to the settlement of sugar and cotton yarn transactions, but the daily net inflow was less than 700 billion for the rest of the week. Fixed deposits from commercial banks at the Central Bank accumulated to a substantial 2.5 trillion by Thursday. Black market interest rates hovered within 30%. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong exchange rate frequently narrowed last week, repeatedly setting new records. The factors contributing to this new wave of price increases are summarized and analyzed below:

First, adjustments to state-owned enterprise prices: (1) Effective June 5th, nationwide shipping passenger and freight rates increased by 90%. However, passenger fares from Taiwan to Shanghai, calculated in Taiwan dollars, increased by 25%, while freight rates remained unchanged. (2) Effective June 7th, China Central and China National Aviation Corporation adjusted their fares, with the Southern routes (including Hong Kong, Xiamen, Taiwan, and Shantou) increasing by 85% of the original price, Western routes (including Chongqing, Guiyang, Kunming, and Chengdu) by 65%, and Northern routes (including Qingdao, Jinan, Beijing, and Panjin) by 55%. (3) Effective June 7th, nationwide railway passenger and freight rates were adjusted, with passenger tickets increasing by 50% of the original price, general freight by 90%, and valuable freight by 120%. (4) Various public utilities in this city adjusted to new prices on June 12th, with water and electricity increasing by approximately 35%. This series of price increases significantly increased freight costs, inevitably pushing up commodity prices. For example, the price of rice in Shanghai increased by 500,000 to 600,000 yuan per picul the day after the railway freight rate adjustment.

Second, loose and excessive credit. There are many reasons for loose credit conditions, the most fundamental being the government's massive expenditures and inability to balance revenue, relying on printing money to compensate, leading to continuous inflation and rising prices. The government's efforts to stabilize prices cannot address this fundamental issue, and ultimately, all stopgap measures are ineffective. According to reports, the national budget for the second half of the year will increase based on the budget figures for the first half, adjusted for the price index. With total budget revenue of over 5.8 trillion yuan and total expenditure of over 9.6 trillion yuan in the first half of the year, the expenditure for the second half of the year is estimated to reach approximately 360 trillion yuan, a staggering figure. In addition to this fundamental cause, recent accidental events include: (1) Rumors that the Central Bank will issue 10,000-yuan gold yuan certificates for circulation, setting a new record for banknote denominations at 200,000 yuan. (2) As previously mentioned in this publication, the authorities' ban on same-day check clearing, implemented on June 1st, aimed to reduce the speed of currency circulation and stabilize prices, but this is questionable. According to the head of the Financial Control Bureau, the issuance of commercial drafts has recently surged. Inspections indicate that the situation is generally good, and most drafts are issued in response to actual customer needs. However, this large-scale circulation of high-value commercial drafts naturally leads to credit expansion and increased currency circulation, inducing price increases. (3) Recently, the market has seen loose credit and abundant cash, with reports of over 1 trillion yuan in cash flowing in from North China daily.

Third, Central Bank Governor Yu's statement on Monday regarding full support for productive enterprises: "(1) The Central Bank will strive to support legitimate productive enterprises by providing funds through rediscounting or re-mortgaging, and will guide commercial banks to engage in promoting production and developing national resources. (2) The Central Bank will provide equal financing facilities to national and private financial institutions, without discrimination, under the premise of supporting productive enterprises. (3) The Central Bank will do its best to guide idle social capital into productive channels. The short-term treasury bills currently issued are not intended to balance the budget but to absorb idle social capital and guide it into production. In the past, low bank deposit rates led to a large influx of idle capital into the speculative market. This phenomenon can be reduced in the future. (4) With the Central Bank's measures now aimed at supporting productive enterprises, all industrial and commercial entities can strive for development, and it is hoped that commercial banks will cooperate with the Central Bank to complete this task." After this statement, the stock market soared the next day, as everyone had a new prediction for the future of productive enterprises, increasing investment interest and creating a flourishing market. We agree with Mr. Yu's statement in principle, but in its practical application, special attention should be paid to the distinction between genuine productive work and opportunistic speculation, as a slight negligence can lead to vastly different results.

Fourth, regarding the government's policy of selling commodities, the quantity sold recently has been decreasing, and the prices are gradually increasing. This indecisive approach gives speculators an incentive. For example, the government previously sold rice but announced a halt from the previous week. Regarding cotton yarn, it is rumored that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, citing low inventory levels, ordered the Yarn Control Committee to cease selling, which has led to a shift in market prices. In terms of allocation prices, 16-count Fairy yarn rose from 2.22 million yuan at the beginning of the week to 2.65 million yuan by the weekend, while Hankou fine velvet rose from 3.4 million yuan on June 1st to 4.8 million yuan on June 12th. Taiwan sugar's allocation price is also increasing due to the continuous adjustment of the Taiwan dollar exchange rate. Last week, the Taiwan dollar exchange rate was 375 yuan on Monday, 390 yuan on Wednesday, 401 yuan on Thursday, and 420 yuan on the weekend.

The trend of market prices last week continued to advance at high levels, with new prices being set almost daily, especially for grains, textiles, metals, and chemicals. All indices rose by more than 20%. Stimulated by the aforementioned factors, and due to the sharp contraction of the Hong Kong exchange rate and rumors of adjustments to foreign exchange rates, the stock market was exceptionally strong last week. Wing On cotton yarn reached a high of 3,815 yuan on Friday before closing at 3,700 yuan, setting a new record. Under this trend, foreign stocks were also very strong, with Ewo cotton yarn reaching a high of 5.81 million on Friday. In the yarn market, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn stood at a high of 4.75 million yuan, 21-count Double Horse yarn at a high of 3.1 million yuan, and Dragon Head fine cloth broke the 10 million yuan mark by the weekend. Rice prices rose frequently due to reported price increases in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In the Taipei market, white japonica rice was approaching a high of 9 million yuan, with off-market bids exceeding this figure. Other miscellaneous grains, oils, and flours also followed suit with rapid increases. Friday was the Dragon Boat Festival, and the grain market was completely closed. Daily necessities such as soap and matches continued to rise, with Gu Ben soap breaking the 10 million yuan mark by the weekend. Chemicals such as 100 kg of Moon Brand caustic soda rose from 1.95 million yuan at the beginning of the week to 2.24 million yuan on Friday.

### Monetary and Financial Affairs

(1) Credit and Black Market Interest Rates

Last week, Friday coincided with the Dragon Boat Festival. Traditionally, many debts are settled around such holidays, which inevitably affects credit conditions. However, this year's objective conditions are different from the past. Cumulative inflation persists, and despite repeated attempts by banks to tighten credit, the desired effects have not been achieved. While materials are being sold off and same-day check clearing is prohibited, large-denomination gold yuan certificates are continuously being shipped in. According to reports from last week, 200 boxes of new banknotes, worth a total of 40 trillion yuan, were shipped from England to Shanghai. Although the authorities have formed a "Credit Coordination Committee" to suppress speculative capital, the amount of money issued inevitably far exceeds the amount collected, in order to cover today's huge fiscal deficits. This can be said to be the crux of the difficulty in tightening credit. As for the flow of capital from North to South and vice versa, and the substitution of commercial drafts for checks, these are merely derivative phenomena of malignant inflation. Without addressing the root cause, it is difficult to solve the superficial problems. Therefore, despite the opportune Dragon Boat Festival and the artificial tightening of credit, credit conditions remained loose throughout the week.

Black market interest rates were most commonly at 27%, with the weekend seeing some rates as low as 24% due to the excessive credit, making it difficult to lend money out. Interest rates outside the stock exchange also trended downwards. On Monday, the interest rate for the long side was 35 yuan per share, and the interest rate for the short side was 31 yuan per share, carrying over from the previous weekend. From Tuesday to Thursday, these rates decreased to 34 yuan and 30 yuan respectively, and then decreased by one yuan each on Friday.

Although the net inflow of the National Bank treasury from Monday to Friday reached 30,758 billion yuan, an increase of 12,627 billion yuan compared to the previous week, if we deduct the over 27 trillion yuan in fixed deposits from commercial banks at the Central Bank during the same period, the actual net inflow was only 2-3 trillion yuan. The effect of this 2-3 trillion yuan inflow on the overflowing speculative capital market is naturally minimal!

The net inflow of foreign banks from Monday to Friday totaled 772 billion yuan, a decrease of 440.8 billion yuan compared to the same period of the previous week.

Commercial banks generally had ample cash and commercial drafts. Interbank lending was infrequent. Clearing results for banks after number 60 showed a net outflow of 22,141 billion yuan from Monday to Friday, an increase of 10,642 billion yuan compared to the same period of the previous week. However, credit conditions in the market did not tighten as a result, indicating the general abundance of speculative capital.

(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates

Last week, the base exchange rate remained unchanged, but the price of exchange certificates continued to rise under the influence of external factors, reaching 620,000 at one point on Friday, although the volume of transactions was small. The Hong Kong exchange rate continued to narrow, with 100,000 legal tender equal to 41 cents Hong Kong on Monday, and narrowing to 39 cents from Tuesday to Thursday. The price of gold in Hong Kong decreased from 331.5 Hong Kong dollars per tael on Monday to 329 Hong Kong dollars on Thursday. The market price of US dollars was generally between 5.54 and 5.55.

Domestic exchange rates in Shanghai generally increased last week. The exchange rate for Guangzhou was only 80 yuan at the end of the previous week, but rose to 120 yuan on Monday and continued to rise to 150 yuan from Tuesday to Friday, further intensifying the flow of capital to the South. The exchange rate for Xiamen was 120 yuan from Monday to Thursday, and then decreased to 100 yuan on Friday. The exchange rate for Hankou also increased, starting at 30 yuan on Monday and rising to 60 yuan on Thursday, before slightly decreasing to 50 yuan on Friday. The exchange rate for Chongqing was a discount of 20 yuan before Wednesday, but changed to a premium of 20 yuan on Thursday and Friday. Although the exchange rate for Tianjin was generally stable at a discount of 50 yuan before Thursday, the discount suddenly doubled to 100 yuan on Friday, indicating a renewed trend of capital flowing from North to South.

(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

At the beginning of the week, speculative capital poured in from other cities, and the increasing popularity of commercial drafts led to loose credit conditions. External factors and commodity prices both experienced rapid increases, and the general sentiment was optimistic. The Chinese stock market was no exception, with Wing On cotton yarn briefly reaching 3,390 yuan before large investors sold off to realize profits, bringing the closing price back down to 3,150 yuan. China Cement soared due to special positive news. On Tuesday, credit conditions remained loose, and rumors of easing industrial and commercial loans excited investors. Wing On cotton yarn set a high of 3,440 yuan. Most stocks rose, and the volume of transactions was quite strong. On Wednesday, even more speculative capital gathered in Shanghai, and external factors became even stronger. The Chinese stock market rose even more sharply, with Wing On cotton yarn breaking through the 3,600 yuan mark. China Cement, China Trust, and China Silk all reached their price limits. Stocks that did not reach their price limits also increased by half, and the volume of transactions increased sharply. On Thursday, Wing On cotton yarn initially continued the upward momentum of the previous few days, briefly soaring to a new high of 3,710 yuan, but individual investors were unstable and sold off to realize profits, bringing the price down to the 3,500 yuan mark. China Trust was at 1,130 yuan, New Light at 42 yuan, and Jingfu at only 21.1 yuan. On Friday, the Chinese stock market showed its beauty again on the Dragon Boat Festival. High prices were frequently seen for Wing On cotton yarn, which surged to a new high of 3,815 yuan. Other stocks also rose, with 15 stocks reaching their price limits, including Datong, Rongfeng, New Light, Jingfu, Jinglun, Dongxing, Mei Ya, Zhongxing, Xinyi, Matches, Huafeng, China Cement, China France, Xinhua, and China Merchants, all seemingly celebrating the holiday. On the weekend, Wing On cotton yarn stabilized after rising too sharply in recent days, while many small and medium-sized stocks gained momentum and followed the upward trend.

At the beginning of the week, the Hong Kong exchange rate contracted, the black market was chaotic, and investors were active, vying to buy stocks. All stocks rose across the board, but after the authorities signaled serious pressure, prices fell slightly. Ewo cotton yarn closed at 5.2 million yuan, British American Land was bid at 6.2 million yuan, and Wheelock Marden was at 12 million yuan. On Tuesday, due to extremely loose credit conditions, stocks rose again. Wheelock Marden rose by 1 million compared to the previous day, British American Land rose by 100,000, and Ewo cotton yarn rose by 350,000. On Wednesday, the black market rose even more sharply, credit conditions were extremely loose, and investor sentiment became even more excited. All stocks rose, with Ewo cotton yarn rising the most, reaching 5.75 million yuan. British American Land was at 6.55 million yuan, and Wheelock Marden was at 13.2 million yuan. On Thursday, the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to contract, and the black market rose significantly. However, due to the phenomenon of capital flowing out of the Hong Kong stock market, both buyers and sellers adopted a wait-and-see approach, and the market trended weaker. Ewo cotton yarn fell to 5.62 million, British American Land was at 6.53 million, and Wheelock Marden rose to 13.7 million. On Friday, investor sentiment remained cautious, and trading was thin. The trend was mixed. Wheelock Marden was at 14 million, Ewo cotton yarn rose to 5.83 million, and British American Land was at 6.7 million. On the weekend, due to new high prices for various external commodities, foreign stocks also mostly reached new highs. Ewo cotton yarn closed at 6 million yuan in the afternoon, British American Land was at 6.9 million yuan, and Wheelock Marden was at 15 million yuan.

### Industrial and Commercial Developments

The Test of the New Foreign Exchange Regulations

Since the promulgation of the new foreign exchange regulations, the reactions have been mixed, but the implementation techniques of the new regulations have not been thoroughly improved to date. In addition, changes in other economic factors caused by the promulgation of the new regulations, such as rising domestic prices of export goods, falling foreign prices, and the continued rise in black market foreign exchange prices, have greatly reduced the possibility of the new system's success. The new threats to the industrial and commercial sectors posed by the new foreign exchange regulations over the past week are listed below:

(1) According to the person in charge of the China Cotton Textile Production and Sales Joint Company, although the new exchange settlement method has been implemented, cotton textiles have not yet been exported. The reason is that the market price of exchange settlement certificates is too low, and the few transactions conducted by major banks cannot be considered representative. China's cotton textile market in the South Pacific Islands is also about to be seized by Japan, so it will be even more difficult to export cotton textiles in the future.

(2) According to sources from the sausage casing exporters, after the promulgation of the exchange settlement certificate method, domestic sausage casing prices have risen by 130,000 to 150,000 yuan per set. However, the US market price, calculated using the exchange settlement certificate price, is only 120,000 to 130,000 yuan per set, so sausage casing exports remain as difficult as before.

(3) According to a tung oil exporter, tung oil has not yet been exported recently, because the difference between the exchange settlement certificate price and the black market price is as high as 60%. Currently, tung oil in the New York market is 24 cents per pound, equivalent to 21 cents for delivery at the Shanghai dock. Calculated using the market price of exchange settlement certificates, each dan (unit of weight) is worth 21 million yuan, but the current market price in Shanghai is already 20.5 million yuan, so its export remains difficult. In addition, according to China Trust Bureau (CTB) sources, US importers are expected to compete to sell their inventories of tung oil, and the US government plans to auction 1,600 tons of tung oil purchased from American tung tree farmers in the near future, which will also have a significant impact on our tung oil sales.

(4) Regarding hog bristle exports, according to CTB sources, the foreign hog bristle market has also been disrupted by the new foreign exchange regulations. Although there are many domestic sellers seeking to sell, foreign buyers are not making counter-offers. The market conditions are the same as the previous week, but there are transactions without trade (行無市).

(5) The issue of foreign exchange settlement for public utilities due to the new foreign exchange regulations, although senators have petitioned in Beijing, requesting the authorities to settle foreign exchange at the Central Bank's exchange rate. However, according to the Ta Kung Pao, the new price adjustment date for water, electricity, gas, and telephone services has been delayed for a long time due to the excessive losses of each company. Therefore, the municipal government is considering restoring additional methods and may collect additional fees from June 6th. It seems that public utilities are facing another price increase.

(6) Originally, one of the purposes of the new foreign exchange regulations was to base imports on the foreign exchange earned from exports. However, as mentioned above, whether exports can be promoted is a major issue, so the so-called easing of imports of production equipment is just a pipe dream. For example, the Import-Export Management Committee (輸管會) held a meeting on the 10th to discuss the import of production equipment listed in Schedule I, but it is said that "due to foreign exchange difficulties, no concrete decisions have been made." Previously, some people viewed the new foreign exchange regulations as having a "linked import and export" spirit, but the current facts prove that imports and exports are still in a "disconnected" situation.

(7) Another example of the insufficient foreign exchange and the failure of the new foreign exchange regulations to link import and export trade is fully revealed in the recent fuel oil panic. According to reports, Mobil and other three foreign oil companies in Shanghai jointly notified China Central and Civil Air Transport that they would stop supplying gasoline from the 6th because the Import-Export Management Committee had not approved the quota for the three companies to supply aviation fuel to China Central and Civil Air Transport. The Import-Export Management Committee then approved a quota of US$250,000 for the three companies to supply aviation fuel to civil aviation on the 4th, but it is said that this amount can only last for one month. The three oil companies also suddenly notified China Central and Civil Air Transport on Tuesday, citing the exchange settlement certificate, that the oil price would increase by 80%, and the crisis in civil air transport is also on the rise. In addition, the fuel exchange settlement issue of the Shipping Association has not been resolved. Although it is said that the authorities have removed this oil class from the import quota allocation for the fifth and sixth seasons because the US aid has listed diesel, gasoline, and other fuel oils, it is not difficult to see the embarrassment of the authorities due to the shortage of foreign exchange. If US aid is still delayed or repeatedly reduced, the critical situation will be difficult to sustain!

(8) Increasing overseas remittances is probably one of the positive goals of the new foreign exchange regulations, but according to reports, although remittances from overseas Chinese are expected to increase slightly due to the promulgation of the new system, the difference between the black market and the exchange rate obtained through the exchange settlement method is still large, and the procedures are also difficult, so the prospects for attracting overseas remittances are still not optimistic.

Whether the new foreign exchange regulations can be successful is still difficult to say with certainty, but whether it can withstand a series of real-world tests is gradually becoming apparent. Undoubtedly, the new regulations will go through the years it should have, just like the old regulations, but the length of time a "regulation" is implemented is not the standard for its success or failure. From a local perspective or in terms of the interests of a certain group of people, this is a relatively successful "regulation," so it has been delayed for some time. However, from an overall and long-term perspective, the same "regulation" may well be the prelude to greater chaos and greater difficulties. At present, the main principles can be said to be set, and under the unchanged principles, we must find some remedies that treat the symptom but not the cause. Although it is often welcomed by some "non-high-profile" or so-called "technical experts, the phenomenon of "treating the head but the foot hurts" will inevitably occur. Not only that, with the passage of time and the changes in social conditions, if the second "headache and foot pain" is more extensive and severe than the first, how can the evaluation of the first treatment be considered a success!

### Representatives of Overseas Chinese Schools Urge Concessions: Present Four Requests to Siam; Detailed Answers Provided by Siamese Deputy Minister of Education

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 12th] The Chinese Embassy in Siam presented a new note to the Siamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 12th, seeking a reasonable resolution to the current issue of overseas Chinese schools. Meanwhile, representatives of the teachers of the overseas Chinese schools once again appealed to the Siamese Ministry of Education for concessions. The four requests presented by the representatives were given detailed answers by the Siamese Deputy Minister of Education, Nai Sukdi. The details are recorded below: The first request claimed that schools teaching Chinese are different from other private schools, and we request special treatment. The Siamese Ministry of Education replied: This Ministry's policies do not discriminate against private schools of any country or ethnicity, and all such private schools are established under the same laws. The second request concerned the agreement signed between the former Thamrong government and the Chinese Embassy. The Ministry of Education replied: This agreement is currently being implemented accurately and practically. Overseas Chinese themselves have some misunderstandings because their demands far exceed what they should enjoy under the agreement. "Article 6 of the Sino-Siamese Friendship Treaty clearly stipulates that nationals of both contracting parties may, in compliance with the laws and regulations of the country where they are located, establish schools to educate their children and enjoy freedom of assembly, association, publication, and religious belief." At the same time, the Siamese side strongly emphasized the phrase "compliance with the laws and regulations of the country where they are located." The third request was why overseas Chinese schools are not allowed to enroll students aged eight to fifteen. The Siamese Deputy Minister of Education replied: Overseas Chinese schools will be allowed to enroll such students after complying with the regulations of the Private Schools Act. The fourth request was that the Siamese Ministry of Education should recognize teachers of overseas Chinese schools who lost their wartime certificates. The Siamese Deputy Minister of Education replied: The Siamese Ministry of Education cannot take action based on rumors. In any case, a remedy for this problem already exists. "The Siamese Ministry of Education believes that all rumors about the loss of wartime teacher certificates are just rumors. Any qualified teacher can apply for a re-examination to prove their qualifications. Anyone can use this convenience. In fact, only a few teachers can pass the examination because the examination has strict standards for Siamese language proficiency." The inability of students aged eight to fifteen to enroll and the lack of a sufficient number of teachers are the direct factors that all overseas Chinese schools in Siam need to suspend classes.

### China Education Society Regularly Selects Honorary Teacher Candidates; China Education Research Association Provides Key Points for Improvement

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Branch of the China Education Society will hold a meeting of directors and supervisors at the Kindergarten Teachers College at 3:00 PM on the 18th to select three honorary teacher candidates from among its members to be reported to the General Association. After review by the General Association, nominations will be made to the Joint Association of Chinese Educational Academic Organizations.

[Another Report] The Committee for the Study of Secondary Education of the China Education Society successfully closed on the 12th. In addition to a detailed written report published in the fourth issue of the China Education Society's Newsletter on various issues related to secondary education and further research, the committee specifically provided the following key points for improvement: (A) Issues of Secondary School Functions: (1) Secondary schools must be differentiated; single-subject secondary schools cannot meet the individual needs of young people and the needs of society. (2) The method of differentiation should not be rigidly stipulated by the educational administrative authorities. Secondary education experts in various regions should conduct detailed research and experiments. Once results are available, they should be made public to society for adoption. (B) Vocational Education Issues at the Secondary Education Stage: (1) The government should find ways to closely integrate vocational education with productive enterprises. (2) Equal importance should be attached to both supplementary vocational schools and formal vocational schools. (3) The implementation of vocational guidance should be strengthened. (4) Improvements to the content of vocational education should start from the curriculum, teaching materials, teachers, teaching methods, and practical training. (C) Issues of Articulation between Secondary Schools and Universities: (1) High school and university teachers should establish contact with each other. (2) University entrance examination questions should effectively comply with the current secondary school curriculum standards. (3) High schools should strengthen college counseling, and universities should implement freshman orientation. (D) Improving the Quality of Secondary Education Teachers: (1) The current system of advanced normal education must be improved in a planned way. (2) To solve the teacher shortage, we should start by increasing salaries, stabilizing livelihoods, and guaranteeing employment. (3) In-service teacher training should be encouraged in many ways. Higher education institutions, especially normal colleges, should open up opportunities for further study. Educational administrative authorities should set up resolutions and have strict negotiations with international cultural institutions to implement overseas study. (E) Issues of Life Training for Middle School Students: (1) Actively promote the excellent moral character of middle school teachers. (2) The homeroom teacher system must be strengthened. Larger-scale middle schools may use a permanent homeroom teacher system. (3) Effectively improve the healthy lives of young people. (4) Pay attention to the normal development of young people's emotional lives and social behavior. (5) Strengthen the implementation of systematic extracurricular activities to cultivate young people's excellent character. (F) Strengthening the Administrative Efficiency of Secondary Education in Provinces and Cities: (1) Policies should not be changed easily. (2) Establish a reasonable personnel system and implement it effectively (including selection, recruitment, appointment, treatment, training, etc.). (3) Simplify administrative procedures. (4) Administrative authorities should provide more active guidance and less passive restrictions to the schools under their jurisdiction.

### Education Society Welcomes Legislators

[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing] The Nanjing Branch of the China Education Society recently held its sixth membership meeting at the National Central University Alumni Association in Sipaillou, Nanjing. It welcomed the newly elected members of the Legislative Yuan and bid farewell to member Cheng Qibao, who was attending international education conferences and lecturing and inspecting. Members of the Legislative Yuan Hu Shuhua, Cheng Tianfang, Li Zheng, Cheng Qibao, Huang Linshu, Xiang Jutan, Ni Wenya, Chen Jitang, Meng Yunqiao, Huang Jianzhong, and members Zhu Muzun, Gu Yiqiao, Zhao Naibo, Zhang Liuquan, Wang Jingqing, Chen Dongyuan, Liu Jihong, Hu Jiajian, and more than sixty others attended. Chairman Luo Tingguang first delivered a welcome speech. Then Cheng Shizhi and Yuan Boqiao reported on the recent situation of the General Association. Subsequently, the legislators spoke one after another.

Hu Shuhua's Speech: Hu Shuhua said: He has been involved in education for more than ten years and deeply feels that education can only be successful when it is coordinated with politics and economics. Therefore, he came to the Legislative Yuan and raised two issues for discussion regarding current education: (1) There is a contradictory phenomenon in today's education. There are many candidates, but few are admitted. Therefore, some say that there are too few universities, but judging from the national education funding and the lack of teachers, there are actually too many universities. How should this problem be solved? Emphasis on quality or quantity? He advocates emphasizing quality and enriching the existing university facilities before considering further expansion. (2) The issue of students' career paths: The government cannot find jobs for graduates. It would be better to run more normal schools and vocational schools in middle schools, which can guarantee students' career paths.

Cheng Tianfang's Speech: Cheng Tianfang hoped that the Education Society and the legislators would maintain more contact. The legislators are representatives of the people, and the Legislative Yuan should reflect public opinion. In the past, all levels of public opinion institutions were disconnected from the people, while British and American parliamentarians often maintained contact with the people. Voters should communicate with parliamentarians and ask them to introduce various bills in the parliament. Parliamentarians can only obey the Chinese people. Most of the people are not concerned about national affairs because their education level is too low, which further increases the responsibility of intellectuals. In the future, the Legislative Yuan must establish contact with the intellectual class, and education colleagues are the backbone of the intellectuals. He hopes for regular communication and welcomes opinions on various issues. Secondly, education colleagues have a major mission under the current circumstances. Because political corruption and financial chaos inevitably foster a pessimistic and disappointed mentality, and emotions of arrogance and boredom follow, everyone is speculative and short-sighted, only caring about their own interests and not paying attention to national crises. This phenomenon requires the correction of education workers. Since we are engaged in education, we are certainly not afraid of difficulties and believe that we will be able to complete the mission.

Li Yunting's Speech: Li Yunting said: The Legislative Yuan is about to review the budget for the second half of the year. More than one hundred legislators in the Cultural Education Committee are participating, accounting for one-sixth of all legislators. They are determined to realize the 15% proportion of education funding stipulated by the Constitution. He hoped that the Education Society would provide the necessary reference materials for striving for this goal. Secondly, education workers should try to maintain the pure spirit of students and not be assimilated by society. For example, the corrupt officials of today were also pure students twenty or thirty years ago. These people are about to die and are not to be feared. He hopes that each generation will be better than the last.

Other legislators, Meng Yunqiao, Ni Wenya, Xiang Jutan, and Huang Jianzhong, were successively invited to speak. Cheng Qibao reported that he was scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 10th, first to the UNESCO organization in Paris, where he would stay for two weeks to establish working contacts. After the meeting, he would go to the UK and the US to study education and return to China in about three months. Then Gu Yiqiao expressed his opinions on education funding. Finally, Zhao Jiuchuan summarized everyone's speeches. After several hours, the hosts and guests dispersed happily.

### The Predicament of Studying Abroad is Not True: Ministry of Education Issues Statement

[Reported by this newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] It has been rumored that Chinese students in the United States who have been admitted to universities are in dire straits recently, especially those who are studying in the United States on government scholarships. Regarding this matter, according to officials in charge of the Ministry of Education: The Ministry has a total of 72 government-sponsored students studying in the United States, including 40 in the 33rd year and 32 in the 35th year. Among them, the government-sponsored students of the 33rd year had their government scholarships interrupted for a short period due to the settlement of foreign exchange, but all the expenses required by these students have been remitted on March 6 this year. The expenses of the government-sponsored students of the 35th year have not been interrupted, and there is no situation of financial hardship. As for self-funded students studying in the United States: (1) Those who are admitted can settle foreign exchange at the official rate according to regulations; (2) Scholarship students who meet the regulations can settle the differential foreign exchange, and those who do not meet the regulations cannot settle the differential foreign exchange. The amount insufficient for the scholarship must be planned by themselves; (3) For other students who provide their own foreign exchange, the documents of their foreign exchange source have been carefully reviewed by the Ministry before going abroad. The expenses of self-funded students approved by the Ministry should not be a problem.

### UNESCO Representative Ming Fei Ke

[Reported by this newspaper, Chongqing, 13th] UNESCO representative Yue Bo Yao and Ministry of Education member Ruan Kangcheng flew from Nanjing to Chongqing. Today, they will visit Chongqing University and fly to Chengdu on the 15th for inspection.

### The Library of Congress of the United States Collects Our Rare Books: A Total of 1,600 Types of Song and Yuan Imprints; Peking University Publishing Department Undertakes Printing of the Catalog

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th] The Peking University Publishing Department is undertaking the printing of the catalog of rare books in the Library of Congress of the United States, which is the most noteworthy news in the academic community. Professor Wang Chongmin, director of the Special Collections Department of the Peking University Library, told reporters on the 12th: The Library of Congress of the United States has a collection of as many as 1,622 kinds of rare ancient Chinese books, including ten Song imprints, Buddhist scriptures from the Leifeng Pagoda printed in the eighth year of the Kaibao reign of Emperor Taizu of Song (975 AD), and twelve Yuan imprints. The Jin imprints that our scholars call the Jin imprints are also included. There are 1,422 kinds of Ming imprints, including 72 kinds of vermilion ink prints. There are 58 kinds of early Qing imprints, mostly banned books or Ming annotations. There are also 120 kinds of manuscripts, including nine Dunhuang manuscripts. Wang also said: The 5,000 kinds of rare books collected by the Peking University Library are the best in our country. The Jiangsu National Academy Library has 2,548 kinds, and the Palace Museum Library has 1,025 kinds. Therefore, the collection of the Library of Congress of the United States ranks third in the world. However, the current Central Library has advanced to the second place. This time, compiling and printing the catalog of rare books for the Library of Congress of the United States is also the beginning of international cultural cooperation. Now that Bei Huo is undertaking the printing, it will be published in two months, and its printing art will surely win the attention of foreign countries. He also said: Americans have recently been buying up rare copies in Beijing, which is worth paying attention to. Our country should find ways to preserve rare copies. The cultural institutions should guide the Book Industry Association to sell the popular Ming imprints on the market to foreigners as a medium for cultural communication.

### Students Exiled from Western Liaoning Go to Tianjin to Study at the Joint Middle School

### Shanghai University Negotiates to Purchase Vacant Land; Limited to More Than 100,000 US Dollars

[Reported by this newspaper] Because the construction of Shanghai University has increased repeatedly, the vacant land is decreasing day by day, and the land to the south is owned by the Air Force, the proposal for expansion cannot be realized. Now the school is negotiating to purchase the vacant land to the north. The land is 300 to 400 acres in total. If the purchase is successful, the entire construction plan can be gradually started. According to Principal Ling Xianyang, the American Church allocated 350,000 US dollars last summer to purchase 400 acres of vacant land to the south. Later, 200,000 US dollars was used to build a girls' dormitory. In addition to filling 16 acres of mud land by the river, which still requires thousands of US dollars, the negotiation to purchase the vacant land to the north is limited to 125,000 US dollars.

### Yucai Establishes Parents' Association

### Bad Habit of Beating Referees Difficult to Change: Another Dispute in the Mayor's Cup; Qingbai Maintains Championship; Wins East China Two to One

[Reported by this newspaper] The three-time Mayor's Cup football final, which had been undecided for a long time, was finally held yesterday at 4:00 PM. The two heroes of East China met again. There were about 8,000 spectators in Yiyuan Stadium. As a result of the fierce battle, Qingbai won by a narrow margin of two to one and retained the Mayor's Cup championship. Fifteen minutes after the start of the game, heavy rain poured down. Spectators and players stood upright in the rain, which was commendable. Unfortunately, when the game reached 25 minutes in the second half, Shuanghua was at a disadvantage of one to two. Sure enough, as expected by the referee association, another strange drama of assaulting and insulting the referee occurred. Donghua's Han Nibo slapped referee Jiang Yinseng hard, causing chaos in the football stadium and the game was suspended. Later, Shen Huichun made a cameo appearance to continue officiating, and the game was able to end. Sportsmanship, however, no longer exists, which is deeply regrettable.

East China Scores First, Gains the Upper Hand: The game started at 4:04 PM. The referee was Jiang Yinseng, and the linesmen were Lu Shunde and Li Guoyi. Qingbai's attack was better than its defense. The young forwards were exceptionally sharp. Although East China had many veterans, they were busy coping with the attacks, which was the divergence point of yesterday's game. The rising stars have promising futures. Within five minutes of Qingbai's appearance, the offensive was fierce, but it did not achieve anything. At seven minutes, Han Nibo crossed the ball from the side, and Chen Mingzhe dribbled the ball and rushed forward. Zhang Renyi actually lost his footing. Mingzhe shot hard, and Qin Bigao thought it was out of bounds, but the ball touched the goal post and bounced in. East China took the lead one to zero.

Heavy Rain Pours Down, Each Scores a Tie: At this time, heavy rain suddenly fell. The audience gathered together, and the players fought in the rain. However, the leather ball was wet and surprisingly heavy, and the ground was slippery. The players fell one after another, and the game lost a lot of its excitement. At 22 minutes, Jin Lusheng passed to Xiao Luo, who dribbled the ball directly to the front of the goal. Lin Gen kicked it into a corner kick. Jin took the corner kick, and Xiao Gu headed it out diagonally. Qingbai's five forwards advanced, and Xiao Gao shot near the goal. Chen Huimin caught it and dropped it again. Xiao Gao flew in and rushed into the net, tying the score. The East China people were angry about the goal, thinking that Xiao Gao had already been offside, and protested to the referee on the spot. The first half ended with a one-to-one tie.

Qingbai Takes the Lead, A Fiery Performance: In the second half, Yu Qiaoxing retired, and Jin Chuanhan replaced him. The two sides attacked and defended each other, holding on for 15 minutes. Youliang committed a foul. Xiao Fei took a free kick 30 yards away and shot directly into the net. Chen Huimin played the pipa and settled the ball, but lost it again. The score was two to one, and Qingbai was at a disadvantage. The city of China lost two cities in a row, and was unwilling. Their emotions were tense, and they committed fouls. There was a fiery performance on both sides.

Beating the Referee, Another Strange Drama: At 25 minutes, Xiao Gu and Chen Jiawan collided with each other. Jiang Yinseng penalized East China. Han Nibo stepped forward to question and slapped the referee hard, causing a dispute. The game was suspended as a result. After mediation by the parties involved, Jiang Yinseng resigned, and Shen Huichun, as a staff member of the Football Committee, made a cameo appearance to enforce the law and continue the game. However, after this change, both sides were unwilling to fight. The silver whistle sounded for a long time, and East China was defeated by one to two. East China stated that it had not reached the legal time and stopped the war abruptly, and planned to file another protest.

### Youth Cup Football Match: Jingwu Defeats Qunli

In the semi-finals of the Youth Cup football match, Jingwu fought Qunli yesterday. The battle situation was extremely tense. Jingwu had the opportunity to take a 12-yard penalty one minute after the start of the game, but Wu Jingren's hard shot missed. In less than a minute, Jingwu's left winger Fang Renqiu scored, making it 1-0. Li Rongbang scored again, and Jingwu took the lead 2-0 in the first half. After changing sides to fight again, Qunli was enthusiastic and promising. Yu Zhenyue broke in and made it 2-1. They then won two 12-yard penalties in a row, taking the lead 3-2. Jingwu's Yao Qingsheng scored a one-shot goal, making it a 3-3 tie. In overtime, Wu Jingren, Li Rongbang, and Fang Renqiu scored three goals in a row. Jingwu eliminated Qunli 6-3 and will compete with Donghua B for the final qualification.

### Hangzhou Reporter Basketball Team Wins

[Reported by this newspaper, Hangzhou, 12th] The Hangzhou Reporter Basketball Team played a friendly match with the Qingyou Team today and won with a score of 36 to 155.

### Football Association Issues Statement: Says East China Voluntarily Forfeited

The Municipal Football Committee issued the following statement regarding the dispute that occurred in yesterday's Mayor's Cup football final between East China and Qingbai:

"In the Mayor's Cup football final between East China and Qingbai on the 13th, East China player Han Nibo did not comply with referee Jiang Yinseng's decision and beat the referee on the spot. He was immediately penalized and left the field. Then the team captain declared to the referee that the East China team voluntarily forfeited the game. However, in order to cope with the situation at the time, the remaining game time was refereed by Shen Huichun, an employee of the Association, to continue the unofficial game until the end."

### Letter from Tunghua Expressing Protest

"To the Esteemed Editor,

Regarding the Municipal Cup Final between our team and the Qingbai team on the 13th of this month, due to the referee's inappropriate handling of Qingbai team's first goal, our team captain, Li Yao, immediately protested to the referee. The referee granted the right to reserve the protest. Considering that many spectators outside the field may not fully understand the truth about the dispute that occurred on that day, the facts of the dispute are listed as follows:

(1) When Qingbai scored the first goal, Gao Xiuqing and Gu Yisa had already been offside. The referee, Jiang Yineng, immediately ruled it offside. However, the linesman, Lu Shunde, indicated to the referee that the goal should count. The referee suddenly made a mistake and changed the ruling to "goal" temporarily. Immediately, our team captain, Li Yao, protested to the referee, arguing that since the referee had already ruled it offside, he should not change his decision temporarily. The referee also granted our team the right to reserve the protest, and then the game continued.

(2) In the second half, Gu Yisa of the Qingbai team bumped into Chen Jiawan. The referee instead ruled that Chen committed a foul. Immediately, our team's Han Nibo stepped forward to explain to the referee. The referee, Jiang Yineng, used foul language in English, insulting Han Nibo. Mr. Han argued that in football matches, referees never use foul language to scold players, thus causing a dispute.

(3) The referee refused to officiate and left the field. Since our team's right to protest had been granted by the referee, we waited quietly for the referee to be mediated and be able to return to the field to perform his duties. Eventually, Mr. Shen Huichun took over as the referee. Mr. Shen also said, "Jiang Yineng is unwilling to be the referee, so I will continue to avoid disturbances from the audience." Tunghua can also protest against having two referees in one game.

When Mr. Shen Huichun was officiating, it was 5:25 pm. However, the whistle was blown to end the game at 5:35 pm. Immediately, our team captain, Li Yao, asked Mr. Shen Huichun how long the game had been played. Mr. Shen replied that it was now 5:35 pm. Considering that the second half started at 5:00 pm, even if the time consumed by disputes was included, it should have ended at least at 5:45 pm. The result of a game that has not met the legal time cannot be considered an official score. Therefore, in addition to protesting to the Football Committee, our team has detailed the situation as above and requests that your newspaper kindly publish it. Respectfully submitted by the Tunghua Football Club."

### New Uses for Ultrasound

— Qianghua

If the vibration of a sound wave exceeds 16,000 times per second, it cannot be heard by the human ear. However, the progress of science in today's world has enabled humans to create ultrasound with a vibration rate of up to 12 million times per second. Moreover, in industry, agriculture, military affairs, medicine, meteorology, and even daily life applications, people are experimenting with using this ultrasound that humans cannot hear for various new applications.

We know that modern industry lacks effective and economical methods for inspecting the internal structural integrity of large sand-casted products. However, it is now possible to use sound waves with a vibration rate of over one million times per second to identify hidden flaws in large metal castings. Professor Floyd Firestone of the University of Michigan discovered that when a perfect metal casting is inspected with ultrasound, there is an echo on the opposite side of the metal. This echo can be received and even amplified. However, if there are flaws inside the metal casting, the echo is fastest at the flaw. Therefore, the location of internal flaws can be determined from the speed of the echo. Using this method, large castings up to ten feet thick can be inspected. Today, many famous factories in the United States have widely adopted this method to inspect the quality of propeller shafts for warships or ships and steel axles for train locomotives.

It takes about half an hour to disinfect milk using heat. Dr. A.J. Salle, a bacteriologist at the University of California, has proven that high-frequency sound can complete the disinfection of milk in a few seconds. Many dairy farms now use ultrasound to homogenize milk and kill bacteria in milk. When milk flows through a steel baffle that emits ultrasonic vibrations, the fat breaks down into smaller spheres. As a result, the clumps of milk that coagulate in the stomach are also smaller, making it easier to digest. Doctors believe that this homogenized milk is more suitable for infants.

Food disinfection is one of the major goals of a group of pioneering acoustic engineers. In laboratory tests, sound waves reduced the number of bacteria in each cubic centimeter of milk to eight. In fact, the highest standard of purity for disinfected milk is that each cubic centimeter of milk should not exceed 30,000 bacteria. Sound waves can almost completely eliminate the bacteria in milk, allowing the milk to be stored for several days without spoiling.

The power of sound has also been used to make mayonnaise, peanut butter, creams, dyes, and medicines more uniformly and permanently blended. In the future, the mixers used in the kitchen will only need to hit an F key to make a lattice cake without coarse particles.

The Ultrasound Research Association of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the U.S. Navy are planning to eliminate fog over airports by using sound waves to turn it into rain. In a large glass tank in a Cambridge laboratory, filled with artificial fog, high-frequency sound waves eliminate it in one second. Not long ago, an outdoor experiment was conducted in Arcata, California. However, the strong wind blew the fog away, and the ultrasound did not have time to work. A larger ultrasonic emitter is now being manufactured for further testing.

It is said that Soviet scientists use ultrasound to stimulate the seeds of plants, greatly increasing yields. The results of research by S.L. Ward of the Chrysler Research Experimental Factory revealed that potatoes treated with ultrasound flowered one week earlier than untreated ones, and yields increased by 40% to 50%. Treated peas also sprouted earlier, and some yields were more than three times higher than normal.

Ward handed over the research equipment to Dr. Raymond H. Wallace, a botanist at the University of Connecticut, for further experimentation. In the past two years, Dr. Wallace's research results have been excellent, and in the future, it will definitely be of great benefit to increasing the world's food supply.

Sir Edward Appleton, Director of the British Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, is studying the use of ultrasonic vibrations to shake dirt off clothes and into soapy water. An inventor in Chicago has applied for a patent for his invention of an ultrasonic vacuum cleaner. This device can cause carpets to resonate and vibrate, forcing dust to fall naturally, creating a washing effect.

The American Ultrasound Research Association has created a powerful sound emitter. Its vibrations, from the number of times that human ears can hear to 200,000 vibrations per second, can be felt hundreds of feet away. Standing within its power circle, you don't feel the movement of the air, but you may feel a sense of "impending doom" and may feel sick.

In a large factory that manufactures carbon black, a special sound emitter is installed in the chimney. The vibration of the sound waves causes the carbon particles to collide with each other and form into snowball-like clumps that fall down. Therefore, the carbon particles are not wasted by flying outside. This type of device is also installed in chemical factories to contain odors and prevent the countryside from being harmed. The U.S. Bureau of Casting is studying its use to reduce the damage caused by soot particles in cities.

The aging of alcoholic beverages is due to the collision of certain molecules in the alcohol, and ultrasound can increase the number of collisions. Last winter, the Ultrasound Research Association vibrated newly brewed French wine with ultrasound for a few minutes, and its taste was like that of fine, aged whiskey. Chemical analysis proved that it was the same as wine that had been aged for four years.

Scientists are already imagining using ultrasound to kill or maim people. During the recent war, records of experimental ultrasound killings were found in the city of Lofer, Austria: sound waves that could be heard by humans were regularly emitted through a gas in a whistle-like metal tube, and then focused on the target through a large parabolic reflector. Although the actual battlefield application has not been tested, it is estimated that this method can kill people within 60 meters in 30 to 40 seconds, or maim them within 300 meters. Military authorities are quite concerned that using sound waves to kill people will be one of the terrifying weapons in future world wars.

Medical researchers are also using ultrasound. Drs. John G. Lyon and Tracy J. Patnam of the Columbia University Department of Neurology have used ultrasound to perform brain surgery on 37 cats, dogs, and monkeys without having to break open the skull. The method of application is to reflect sound waves vibrating 800,000 times per second to a certain spot using a curved crystal reflector. Scientists have discovered that they can temporarily excite or destroy a point in a certain selected brain tissue. This work is still in the experimental stage, but it may lead to a type of brain surgery that does not require surgery in the future.

Ultrasonics is still a very new science, and its future development is limitless. Scientists are now only reaching the edge of this new field. They will surely continue to work hard to develop this vast new land for the benefit of mankind.

### New Scientific Weapons

— Liang

Seawater Battery

During World War II, the seawater battery could also be said to be one of the important inventions. This type of battery generates electricity by using seawater. This battery is placed in a small buoy. When needed, simply pull out the mast-shaped antenna and throw it into the sea. It will then immediately emit automatic radio waves. These radio waves can be detected within a radius of 50 nautical miles. Because when this battery enters seawater, it starts to work. With the help of a vibrator, it can generate a voltage of 330 volts and continuously broadcast radio signals for up to 12 hours.

During World War II, many aviators who crashed into the sea due to aircraft damage were rescued by using this device.

Radio-Guided Missiles

It can now be predicted that the flying altitude of bombers in the future will be beyond the range of anti-aircraft guns, so it is impossible to use anti-aircraft fire to shoot down high-altitude aircraft. It is also difficult to use destroyers to attack groups of bombers, because the bomber fleets must have strict protection and mutual defense against external attacks, making it difficult for attacking aircraft to seize the opportunity to enter. Therefore, in order to solve this problem, many scientists and weapons experts at the U.S. Abode Weapons Research Institute planned a projectile weapon using radio engines, loaded with powerful explosives, to break into the enemy's aircraft formation and suddenly explode violently, causing serious damage to the enemy.

If the enemy aircraft formation is afraid of this sharp weapon, they will inevitably disperse their formation and fly separately. At this time, this group of aircraft is a good target for destroyers, because the destroyers can smoothly attack the enemy aircraft at this time. (To be continued)

### The Hairy-Faced Man

— Chongxi

I was quite interested in reading the "Oddities of Ancient and Modern Times" drawing title on page 2 of this newspaper on the 7th of this month, which mentioned "Li Baoshan, a man from Wucheng, Shandong, with a full face of hair, indistinguishable sideburns and eyebrows..." Regarding the facts about this hairy-faced man, Mr. Li, I have been continuously interviewing for more than ten years. I obtained a half-body portrait of Mr. Li in Qingdao (as shown in the left picture) and, based on the information obtained, wrote a short English paper, which was published in the German Journal of Ethnology (Zeitschrift fur Rassenkunde) in the second issue of Volume 6 in 1937, which attracted the attention of anthropologists. Later, with the help of Mr. Xing Zhaojun, a friend from Yenching University in Peiping, I obtained a full-body photo of Mr. Li and photos of his parents. Mr. Xing and Mr. Li grew up in the same village and were childhood friends, so he knew the matter in great detail. Mr. Li's parents were rural farmers who made a living selling tofu. They had many sons, all of whom had normal bodies with no peculiarities, except for Mr. Li, who was born with hair all over his body, especially on his head and face. Even after adulthood, it did not diminish. Mr. Li was very lively and intelligent as a child. Due to family poverty, he could not study. The family considered his strange hair to be unlucky, and his peers often teased him. However, it was precisely because of this strange hair that he had no worries about food and clothing throughout his life. In the 28th year [of the Republic], he came to Shanghai to perform, living in a certain hotel across from the Yong'an Company building on Zhejiang Road. Later, in the 31st year [of the Republic], he went to the United States and joined a circus, performing alone and earning a lot of money. The following year, he went to perform in Southeast Asia, taking the President Cleveland out of Shanghai. Because he did not want outsiders to see through him, he wore masks on the ship, but he was eventually discovered by a reporter from the mainland newspaper at the time, and there was a record of an interview in that newspaper. I also described the matter in detail in the "Scientific Pictorial." Many years have passed, and I don't know where he is now. According to a letter from Mr. Xing, Mr. Li's name is Bao Shu, and he is from near Peiping, which is slightly different from what Mr. Shao Fei said in "Oddities of Ancient and Modern Times." I don't know which is correct and leave it for correction. After my English paper was published, Professor R.R. Gates, F.R.S., a famous British human genetics expert, cited it in his recent book "Human Genetics (Humon. Genetecs, Vols. 2 1947)," saying that such cases are extremely rare. Only one case can be encountered in 200 million births, and even fewer can grow to adulthood. According to scientific research, the world record includes a Russian dog-faced man, a Burmese hairy-faced family, and a black hairy-faced woman. During the fetal period, humans have hair all over their bodies for a period of time, which diminishes after that period. Therefore, after a person is born, body hair is not obvious. Mr. Li's full body hair is probably caused by the dysfunction of a certain endocrine gland in the body and cannot be considered a recurrence of atavism. It is even more absurd to say that it is a variant of apes and monkeys.

### On Catalysis

— Kezhi

Anyone with a little knowledge of science must know about catalysis. Catalysis means that when two things undergo a chemical reaction, if the two things are not easy to change or change very slowly, then if we add a third thing, we can speed up the change. This kind of effect is also called catalysis. This third thing is called a catalyst. It is very strange that the catalyst itself does not undergo any changes at all when it promotes changes. This is truly a miracle in science!

Now, let’s give an example to illustrate catalysis. For example, hydrogen peroxide (hydrogen peroxide) is very easy to decompose into water and oxygen, even at room temperature. If exposed to light or if manganese dioxide (Manganese aioxide) or fine powder of platinum (platinum) is added, the decomposition will be faster. The addition of manganese dioxide platinum powder to make the effect faster is called catalysis, and the powder of manganese dioxide or platinum is called a catalyst, but the added powder of manganese dioxide or platinum does not change.

Hydrogen peroxide sold on the market contains a small amount of organic compounds to prevent the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, because what we need is hydrogen peroxide, and we do not need water or oxygen. Therefore, organic compounds are used to prevent it from changing. So what do we call these organic compounds? If we say they are catalysts, but catalysts increase the rate of change, we give them another term, which is negative catalysts. From the meaning of catalysts, we can infer the meaning of negative catalysts, which are catalysts that can reduce the rate of change, and are called negative catalysts.

The application of catalysis is very wide, especially in chemical changes, almost all of which use catalysis. Combustible gases mixed with oxygen or air can cause a major disaster if they encounter a small fire. For example, coal mine explosions are caused by marsh gas (methane (CH4)) slowly leaking from the coal and becoming a mixture in the air that explodes when it encounters fire. Hydrogen gas and oxygen mixed together can remain unchanged in a dark place permanently; but if they see a little light, they will slowly synthesize into hydrochloric acid, and if placed in sunlight, they will explode immediately.

Also, if a platinum wire is placed on the mouth of a bottle containing wood alcohol (i.e., alcohol), the alcohol gas will combine with the oxygen in the air through the catalysis of platinum, and the platinum wire will become hot and glow red. Similarly, if there is platinum wool on the mouth of a bottle emitting oxygen, the oxygen will burn. Those who have studied chemistry know that potassium chlorate releases oxygen when heated, but some manganese dioxide is often added to make the change proceed faster. For example, sodium sulfite is easily oxidized to sodium sulfate if there is a very small amount of copper compound present.

The application of catalysis in industry is very important. The manufacture of sulfuric acid by the contact method, the direct synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and oxygen, and the manufacture of nitric acid and nitrates from ammonia are all achieved through catalysis. If linseed oil is added to paint, the paint will dry easily. This is not because the linseed oil evaporates, but because the linseed oil easily combines with nitrogen. If lead oxide is used as a catalyst to make boiled oil, it will dry easily and quickly. When acetylene gas C2H2 made from calcium carbide is passed into water, it becomes acetaldehyde if sulfuric acid and mercuric sulfate are present in the water. This is a very important thing, from which acetic acid and acetone can be made. If manganese acetate is added to liquid acetaldehyde and oxygen is passed through, acetic acid is obtained. If manganese acetate is not present, there is a great danger, because there is a kind of peracetic acid which is a violent explosive. Manganese acetate can prevent the production of this acetic acid and remain unchanged itself, so the manganese acetate here is the negative catalyst mentioned above.

Catalysis is also necessary for the chemical reactions in animals and plants, such as the production of sweet potatoes, the production of sugar in sugar beets, the green color of vegetables, and the purple color of violets, all of which are due to enzymes acting as catalysts. Digestion in animal bodies, the function of human nerves and muscles, are all presided over by catalysts. Even the glow of fireflies is the catalytic effect of enzymes.

There are two very common catalysts in nature. The first is oxygen in the air, because there is air everywhere in the universe, so the catalytic effect of oxygen is often imperceptible. The effect proceeds naturally, seemingly unrelated to air. This relationship can only be discovered when the change proceeds in a vacuum or in another gas such as oxygen replacing air. Another very common catalyst is water. Some people knew early on that very dry carbon monoxide and oxygen cannot combine even under the influence of an electric spark, but if there is very little moisture, it immediately turns into carbon dioxide. Sodium and oxygen are the easiest to combine, but in a dry state, they can be heated to melting without changing. For example, dry ammonia and dry hydrogen chloride will not synthesize into ammonium chloride; it will occur immediately when there is moisture. However, in actual situations, it is not that no effect occurs at all without moisture. For example, when carbon monoxide and oxygen are dry, stronger electric sparks or increased air pressure are needed to take effect.

In addition, there is another peculiar thing, that is, in addition to adding one catalyst, adding another catalyst can make the change faster. For example, when potassium chlorate is heated and decomposed, adding manganese dioxide can already make the change faster, but if iron oxide is added, the rate of change is even faster. For example, when synthesizing ammonia, if aluminum oxide is used as a catalyst, adding potassium oxide can increase the catalytic effect of aluminum oxide. We call these iron oxide and potassium oxide promoters, meaning the catalysts of catalysts.

The purpose of using catalysis is to help carry out difficult chemical changes. However, how catalysts can increase or decrease the rate of change is still a mystery. Although precise research has been done, the actual situation is still mysterious and unclear. For example, when making oxygen with potassium chlorate, it is really impossible to say what effect this point of manganese dioxide has.

In short, catalysis is extremely important for both industry and science. If this catalysis had not been discovered, human enjoyment might not be what it is today. If one day the mysterious secrets of catalysis are uncovered, future applications will surely be more extensive. Let's see who uncovers this secret!

### Hypocrisy of the Wealthy

Reports indicate that since Mayor Wu took the lead in demonstrating generosity by donating 500 million yuan for the special relief fund (this sum is said to have been obtained from the sale of paintings by the Mayor's wife at an exhibition in Manila), no one has followed suit with similar contributions. This has greatly worried several committee members, and some have even ridiculed the situation, saying that it proves there are no wealthy households in Shanghai and that talk of wealthy families and large amounts of capital is merely the fabrication of busybodies.

The question of whether there are rich people in China is open to debate and subject to different interpretations based on one's perspective. For example, those in the Legislative Yuan who oppose the imposition of property taxes simply believe that "China has no magnates, and it is unreasonable to deal a blow to those who dedicate themselves to serving the country" (referring to the property tax - the author). Others have even cited grand principles, stating that "the people have already earnestly fulfilled their various tax obligations to the country, and to impose additional taxes now is tantamount to confiscating property and destroying people's livelihoods."

One view is that China has no magnates, while another argues that even if there are magnates, they have already earnestly fulfilled their various tax obligations and should not be subjected to "additional levies" that "amount to confiscating property and destroying people's livelihoods."

It has long been stated in the Three Principles of the People that China has no magnates, only great poverty and small poverty. However, wealth and poverty are relative phenomena. Although China has not yet produced wealthy families as systematic and well-organized as the sixty families in America, the phenomenon of wealth concentrated in the hands of a few cannot be denied. The gap between the great poverty and small poverty that Dr. Sun Yat-sen spoke of has widened further after the two phases of "national crisis wealth" and "victory wealth." Compared to the United States, China is still characterized by great poverty and small poverty, but in terms of the internal phenomena of Chinese society, a clear contrast between great poverty and small poverty has already emerged.

China does have rich people. According to various unofficial estimates from relevant domestic and foreign sources, the private assets of a small number of "upper-class Chinese" in the United States amount to about 400 million US dollars, which is equivalent to the total amount of this American aid. Four hundred million US dollars may be a drop in the bucket in the United States, but if it were contributed to the country, it would certainly have a stabilizing effect on the social economy. Just think of the great effort we have made to have people fly back and forth to Washington, only to obtain this amount, and we still have to endure people's contemptuous looks!

Furthermore, there are countless large and small wealthy households in society. Although no one has responded to the current special relief donation, who were the people who spent thousands of gold pieces to win the "Miss Shanghai" competition in the past? Who are the people who are living lives of depravity and debauchery now? Didn't a certain lady recently want to spend money to build a temple to enshrine a pair of stone figures next to the racetrack? Why are they unwilling to take out some money to help the poor and assist the country?

The saying that the wealthy are unbenevolent is a long-established conclusion, and it applies equally in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad! The Bible says that it is harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, and characters like the Merchant of Venice in Shakespeare's plays are not merely satirical, but are based on real-life experiences. Recently, in Beijing, because no one donated to the special levy, Mayor He Siyuan lamented that asking the rich for money was like seeking skin from a tiger. Some passionate individuals in Beijing advocated organizing students to sing "You, you, you, you old miser!" in front of the homes of wealthy households. Some even suggested moving wounded soldiers and refugees into the homes of the wealthy. Although these actions are not advisable, they show how indignant people are. However, the rich are not entirely unwilling to spend money. If there were another "Miss Shanghai" competition or other activities to satisfy lustful desires, a group of filial sons and obedient grandsons would obediently come forward to contribute. Shanghai has plenty of "adopted fathers" and "dancing hall filial sons." Otherwise, one must rely on monks and nuns. Most of the rich are "pious men and women." Although they cannot be assigned to build bridges and repair roads, they will readily donate money to build temples and decorate Buddha statues. The money chests of the rich have only two keys: one for lust, and one for Buddha. Although our Buddha promotes the idea that lust is emptiness, the intertwining of desire and selfishness shapes the character of our rich.

However, we should not be pessimistic about this phenomenon, let alone discuss grand topics such as social morality and national decline. Every country has a small number of dregs, and every nation is bound to have a small number of scoundrels. Patriotism and national character cannot be found in these few dregs and scoundrels. Methods of moral and public opinion condemnation are unlikely to awaken the reason of these people. As the saying goes, "greed blinds the mind," which refers to this type of person. Since their minds are already blinded, what can we expect from them? To borrow a phrase from Ah Q: "Let them take their enormous wealth to their coffins!"

If the government truly has the courage to order the rich to contribute money, then it should simply implement property requisition, without using the name of special donations. The facts are already before our eyes: it is impossible to get wealthy people to donate voluntarily. If property requisition is implemented, it will certainly renew social ethics; political reform will inevitably follow.

### Amidst the Call for Frugality

— Lian Sun

Recently, a twelve-year-old Dutch child sent the following short story to an American magazine and requested food as payment. People all over the world who have read this story have written letters praising it. I wonder what our Chinese readers will think after reading it?

A young man, seeing that life was becoming increasingly difficult, decided to save money by not taking the tram when he returned home from the office. He followed the tram all the way home and said to his wife, "Dear, I ran behind the tram and saved ten cents."

His wife exclaimed, "You're such a fool! If you had run behind the bus, you could have saved one dollar and twenty-five cents!"

### Original Manuscripts of Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio

— Wei Ren

The original manuscripts of Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio were discovered in Northeast China during the Manchukuo period and were kept by Pu Wenshan, the author's tenth-generation descendant. Yuan Jinkai, a traitor, had selected and printed twenty-four tales, fifteen of which contained more errors and omissions than the published version, and nine of which were not found in the current version. Unfortunately, the copperplate printing made it difficult to reprint, even though the original manuscripts were preserved. Due to the frequent upheavals in Northeast China, it is difficult to trace the whereabouts of the Pu family. The Yuan-printed edition was not publicly distributed, and its circulation is thought to be extremely rare. Therefore, I am transcribing the tale "The Wu Artist" to share with the world.

"A certain Wu artist, whose name is forgotten, loved to paint Lu Dongbin. He always imagined and spiritually connected with him, hoping to meet him one day, and he constantly cherished this thought. One day, he encountered a group of beggars in the suburbs, one of whom, though wearing tattered clothes and exposing his elbows, had a remarkable air about him. The artist's heart stirred, suspecting that he was Lu Dongbin. Upon closer inspection, he became even more certain and grabbed the beggar's arm, saying, 'You are Lu Dongbin.' The beggar laughed loudly. The artist insisted that he was correct and prostrated himself, refusing to rise. The beggar said, 'If I am Lu Dongbin, what will you do?' The artist kowtowed, asking only for guidance. The beggar said, 'It is fortunate that you recognize me, but this is not the place to talk. We will meet again at night.' The artist tried to ask more questions, but the beggar had already vanished in an instant, leaving the artist astonished. That night, Lu Dongbin appeared in his dream, saying, 'I have come to see you because your thoughts are focused and concentrated, but your nature is greedy and stingy, and you cannot become an immortal. I will allow you to see someone.' He waved his hand in the air, and a beautiful woman descended from the sky, dressed like a noble consort, her radiance illuminating the room. Lu Dongbin said, 'This is Consort Dong. Examine her closely.' After a while, he asked again, 'Do you remember her?' The artist replied that he did. Lu Dongbin said again, 'Do not forget her!' Then the woman left, and Lu Dongbin also departed. The artist woke up feeling strange. He painted the woman he had seen in the dream, keeping it secret, and never understood the meaning. Years later, he happened to travel to the capital when Consort Dong died. The Emperor praised her virtue and ordered a portrait to be made, but the assembled artists, relying on oral descriptions and mental impressions, could not capture her likeness. Suddenly, the artist thought, 'Could the woman in my dream be her?' He presented his painting, which was circulated in the palace, and everyone said it was remarkably lifelike. As a result, he was offered the position of court secretary, which he declined, but was given ten thousand gold pieces, and his name became famous. Noble families competed to offer large sums of money, asking him to paint portraits of their ancestors, and all of them were remarkably accurate, even when he painted from memory. Within a month, he accumulated tens of thousands of taels of silver. Zhu Gongkui of Laiwu once saw him."

Other unpublished tales include "The Clam," "The Dragon Takes Water," "The Earth God's Wife," "The Dismissed Dragon," "Admonishing Ghosts," "The Fox of Ling County," "The White Lotus Sect," and "Bestiality," totaling ten tales including the aforementioned one.

The original text is much more concise than the published versions. For example, in the first sentence of "Continuing Yellow Millet Dream," "a licentiate from Fujian named Zeng Xiaolian Gao Jie Nan Gong," the four characters "before being allowed to return home" are crossed out. Above "Astrologer," the two characters "in white" are crossed out. Further down, after "greeted him and sat down, the astrologer," the original text reads: "looked at him and said: 'Sir, you have recently passed the imperial examination, and your spirits are quite high. Have you seen all the flowers of Chang'an?' Zeng shook his head and smiled. The astrologer asked about his birth date, and Zeng smiled and said, 'What official position will I ultimately attain?' As the astrologer pondered, Zeng smiled again and asked, 'Is there no chance of obtaining a python robe and jade belt?' The astrologer said, 'You can easily achieve that within ten years.' Zeng was overjoyed, expressing unexpected delight. The astrologer said seriously: 'Do not consider my words empty.'" The above eighty-six characters are shortened to "seeing his high spirits, he flattered him slightly. Zeng shook his head and smiled, then asked if there was a chance of obtaining a python robe and jade belt. The astrologer seriously promised," leaving only twenty-five characters. There are also omissions in the published versions. For example, in the "Green-Clad Woman" tale, after "diligently reading," the following twenty-two characters are omitted: "He thought, 'Where could I find a woman in the deep mountains?' As he pondered, the woman pushed open the door and entered, saying: 'Diligently reading!'"

In the "Lotus Leaf in the Cold Moon" tale, the original title has been changed to "Taoist Priest of Jinan," but some published versions have "Lotus Leaf in the Cold Moon" or "Lotus Hibiscus in the Cold Moon." The original title of "Tiger of Zhao City," "Tiger Cub," was crossed out and changed. In the "Poyang Lake" tale, the phrase "within which is a statue of the loyal minister Ding Pulang who died in battle" is often rendered as "statue of Taipulang" in popular versions. The original manuscript mistakenly wrote "Ding" as "Wood," and then changed it back to "Ding." The change is blurred, and at first glance it still looks like the character "Wood." Ding Pulang was a meritorious official of the early Ming dynasty, so "Taipulang" is incomprehensible.

### Stone Figures

— Yi Yun

The stone figures in front of the racetrack are becoming increasingly bizarre. Someone has even petitioned the police station, requesting to build a temple at their own expense, move the stone figures for worship, and honor them as Buddhas (as seen in the ninth issue of this newspaper). How fortunate these stone figures are! They have ascended to the Western Paradise, becoming Buddhas and ancestors. This is truly the height of absurdity.

The origin of stone figures can be traced back to Ruan Wengzhong of the Qin dynasty, who was thirteen feet tall and extremely brave. During the reign of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, he stationed troops to defend Lintao, which greatly intimidated the Xiongnu. After his death, Emperor Qin Shi Huang cast a bronze statue of him and placed it outside the Xianyang Palace. Later, people regarded both bronze and stone statues as stone figures. Also, in the book "Primer of Juvenile Learning," there is a saying: "The stone figures in front of tombs were originally stone figures." Therefore, many people today regard stone figures as a specific term for stone figures in front of tombs. In fact, not all stone figures in front of tombs are stone figures. For example, the "Biography of Qiu Xinggong" in the "Book of Tang" states that Emperor Taizong of Tang carved statues of Qiu Xinggong and his horse in stone and placed them in front of the Zhaoling Mausoleum to commend his merit in protecting the Emperor. Therefore, the stone figure in front of the Zhaoling Mausoleum is Qiu Xinggong, not a stone figure. Furthermore, observing the mausoleums in various places, the shapes of the stone figures are different, some civil, some military, some old (with beards), and some young (without beards), so they cannot all be called stone figures.

Generally speaking, stone figures and stone horses, except for those specifically cast for meritorious officials by Emperor Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Taizong of Tang, are merely decorations in front of tombs, just like funerary figurines. One can freely create any kind of figures or animals, without necessarily adhering to the idea that a certain statue is a certain person or has a certain name. However, in the eyes of ignorant men and women, they do not know the origin of these stone figures, nor do they know who Ruan Wengzhong was. Seeing the solemn stone statues, they regard them as gods or Buddhas, kowtowing like pounding garlic and burning incense like bundles of firewood. This kind of incredibly foolish behavior is laughable. However, I dare not hastily conclude that those who petition to move and build a temple are purely driven by the aforementioned superstition. In a corner of Shanghai, there are many people who use deities to make money. Perhaps they see that the stone figures can be used to attract followers and want to take advantage of this opportunity to take ownership of the stone figures as a means of making money. If these "theological speculators" are granted their request, their mischief will be even worse than in front of the racetrack. In short, unless these stone figures are destroyed, their mischief will not stop. The fundamental solution is to smash them, so that future troubles will be eliminated. I wonder what the authorities think?

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimi

Putting on sunglasses and thinking the sunny land is a cool land is so foolish for civilized people.

Some add robes to new clothes, while others prefer to add them after they become dirty.

Flowers have fragrance, the moon has light, mountains have color, water has sound, and people should have the flavor of people.

Fingernails painted with "Rouge Plant" are most suitable for hiding dirt.

"For a thousand years, the pipa speaks in a foreign tongue, clearly discussing grievances and hatred in the melody." - If there is no pipa, even the melancholy beyond the Great Wall cannot be known.

### Miscellaneous Poems of London

— Zheng Xiaocang

The wind rises at dusk, waves crash on clothes, faintly visible by the Tower of London. I don't know how many wronged souls there are, but I see gulls flying over the water.

The library's collection is astonishingly vast, thousands of people silently working at their desks. Spending their lives studying is commonplace, they don't cherish their youthful beauty. (What I saw in the British Museum Library)

Heroism and tenderness are all before my eyes, good and evil are carved together, "Why bother to ask about lasting fame or infamy, there is always noise in the market." (Wax Museum)

The pivot of rise and fall, success and failure, lift up righteousness and make great contributions. Once public opinion turns, return to the smoky waves as a fishing old man. (Remembering Churchill at 10 Downing Street)

Lose rituals and seek it in the fields, this nation's younger generation excels at gathering local songs. Disturbing people eagerly say "thank you," common people know "thank you." (Whether buying tickets on the streetcar or trading in the market, both parties often thank each other, which is a commendable custom.)

Suddenly happy, suddenly sad, as if entering a dream, singing and dancing, wanting to forget the soul, Piccadilly is scattered, and the "Eaton" bell rings.

### 

Tofu has always been regarded as a very ordinary food, so poor officials are called "tofu-eating officials." They only get some sacrificial meat during the Ding sacrifice, which is also called "alfalfa flavor" (not enough meat). Tofu and cabbage represent poverty and simplicity, and this has been the case for a long time. Today, in a changing economic society, the price of tofu and sesame oil is also astonishing. (In the occupied area of ​​the north, sesame oil was sometimes more expensive than pork oil, because the Japanese collected a lot of it to fill their military needs.) The saying that vegetarian food can solve livelihood is no longer applicable. As for whether tofu is completely plain and unremarkable, there is still much room for research. In the past, the four famous "Ju" restaurants in the old capital were all known for their delicious cuisine. They all had excellent dishes made with tofu, such as "chicken floss tofu," "pan-fried tofu," "casserole tofu," and "sauce tofu," which were all popular at banquets. In the market, there are also specialty shops for "stinky tofu," which uses tender tofu with spices, placed in a dark room for a certain period of time, and then taken out. Its color changes and the smell is offensive and unbearable. It is said that the taste is extremely delicious. (It makes me want to vomit, so I have never tried it, only heard people say so.) The oldest one is called Wang Zhili, followed by Wang Zhenghe and Wang Zhihe, all imitating the brand and echoing each other, each with more than two hundred years of history. Many people in the old capital are fond of it. As the saying goes, in the cities of the five capitals, there are people who chase after the foul smell. Is that what it means?

There is a kind of street food in Beijing called "douzhi" (the same as what the beggar Jin Song's family prepared in the play "Red Phoenix Happiness"), which is the soybean residue left over from the tofu workshop when it first makes tofu from soybeans. Some people buy it cheaply and cook it into a juice, which is valued by the bowl. It tastes sour and astringent, but it sells very well. At first, only poor people and coolies ate it, but then students and teachers did too. Whenever there were temple fairs and markets, people flocked to eat it, and the production became more and more refined. Some made a lot of profit and became famous for their production methods, even using "Douzhi Zhang" and "Douzhi Wang" to promote their unique skills. Utilizing waste is our Chinese people's specialty, cherishing materials and benefiting all beings is not to be underestimated.
