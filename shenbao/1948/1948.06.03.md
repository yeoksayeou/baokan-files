The bandits on the north bank of the Yellow River in Ruicheng and Yongji counties have also increased in number and strengthened their fortifications, appearing to have the intention of crossing the river and invading south.

The command post of bandit Zhao Shoushan has also moved north to this location. In addition, the five columns of bandits in northern Shaanxi, namely the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Sixth, have been moving frequently in recent weeks. The Nationalist army advancing towards the bandits from Heyang and Chengcheng may aim to recapture the county seat of Hancheng and the crossings to its north at Yumen and Longmen (west bank of the Yellow River) as their primary objective. The four columns of bandits, namely the First, Second, Third, and Sixth, are currently concentrated in this area and are deployed westward to the line of the southeastern border of Luochuan. There will be a fierce battle south of Hancheng County, as the bandits will definitely defend it to secure the transportation crossings between southern Shanxi and northern Shaanxi, while the Nationalist army will definitely attack it to clear the periphery of Heyang and Chengcheng on the east bank of the Luo River.

### At the Press Conference in Taiwan Province, Deng Wenyi Analyzes the Battle Situation; The Policy of Suppressing the Rebellion is Still Speed and Decisiveness

[Our Correspondent in Taipei, 2nd] Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, attended a press conference held by the Provincial Information Office on the 2nd. He first analyzed the battle situation in Central China, North China, and Northeast China, and will return to Beijing on the 4th. Deng said: "Since the Communist bandits' overall counterattack failed in September of last year, and after their plan to cross the Yellow River and the Yangtze River was shattered, the work of suppressing the bandits has entered a new stage. Although there are about 400,000 Communist bandits in the Central China theater at present, they will be difficult to establish themselves if they cannot obtain supplies quickly. Therefore, the government's decision to implement total war is to compete with the bandits for food, recruits, and villages, in order to defeat their attempts to replenish manpower and supplies locally. Statistics show that 140,000 bandits have been annihilated in April and May. The Nationalist army's casualties were only 30,000. As for the troops of the North China Suppression Headquarters, although they may be dispersed due to guarding Pingjin and the Jinpu roads, they can still be used flexibly. In the Northeast, Lin Biao has 980,000 troops in the hills. He once attempted to open up a corridor between the Northeast and North China, sending 160,000 troops from western Liaoning through Rehe to Jinzhou, which led to the fierce battle surrounding Chengde. However, the government will not allow him to succeed, and some railways in the Northeast may be cut off. According to intelligence: The Communist bandits are now advocating crossing the Yangtze River in August, and the original plan for this year as the decisive battle year has been extended by two years due to changes in the policy of the Communist International. The current government is also preparing to annihilate all the main forces within three years. The gains and losses of one place and the advance and retreat of one city do not affect the overall situation."

Deng continued: Although the government has set the term of the war to suppress the rebellion to three years, this is in response to the Communist bandits' policy of expanding their army to one million, conscripting ten million tons of grain, causing five years of turmoil, and destroying the country in ten years. In fact, strategically, it still does not lose sight of speed and decisiveness, so it is quite possible to eliminate the entire main force of the Communist bandits within two years, so as to shorten the period of suppressing the rebellion. The government is very confident of annihilating the main force of the Communist bandits in Central China within six months. It is hoped that Taiwan will work hard to increase production and complete the rear area tasks.

### Zhou Gengsheng Delivers a Speech in Beijing, Advocating the Establishment of Fair Public Opinion and Taking Responsibility for Guiding the Country onto the Right Track

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 2nd] Zhou Gengsheng, the president of Wuhan University, spoke freely with reporters on the 2nd about the necessity of establishing enlightened, sound, and boldly and fairly argued public opinion. Zhou believes that the current social and economic situation is very difficult, but intellectuals bear the greatest responsibility for the formation of all phenomena. We should consider our own problems less and consider the affairs of the country more, and work for the public good. The dissatisfaction and criticism of the government by the general public, and even the rational complaints, have led to those who truly want to do things keeping themselves clean and unwilling to become officials. They have not fulfilled their responsibility to the country, and in terms of social public opinion, they should also make fair criticisms that distinguish right from wrong. Our country has two superior conditions. First, we are an agricultural country and there is no fear of a lack of materials. Second, the common people are truly fulfilling their obligations to the country without complaint. Therefore, we should take responsibility for guiding the country onto the right track. Zhou advocated boosting morale, establishing fair public opinion, and establishing constructive criticism, regardless of whether it is the government, academia, or public opinion institutions, all those who are wrong can be criticized. Zhou has been in Beijing for more than two months. In addition to attending the National Assembly, he has applied to Wuhan University for construction funding of 60 billion yuan, which has been approved by the authorities. However, it will take a long time to complete the formalities. He is expected to receive it in the near future, and Zhou intends to return to Wuhan immediately to preside over school affairs.

### Convening Members of the Various Committees of the Legislative Yuan Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday; Heated Discussions on the Livelihood and Welfare Issues of Legislative Members

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 2nd] The Legislative Yuan held a joint meeting of the convening members of the various committees on the 2nd to discuss the livelihood and welfare issues of the members of the Yuan. Observers were not allowed. It is reported that 134 members attended the meeting. Cheng Tianfang, Ning Yin, and Zheng Shuwen were first appointed as conveners, and then Mr. Lei presided over the meeting, which launched a heated discussion on the personal issues of the members. The focus of the speeches was generally on the two major parts of spending money and using people. The spending of money is roughly divided into three items: (1) The issue of public funds. Some members emphasized that Legislative Members are representatives of the people who deliberate and serve, and the standard of public funds should follow the treatment of specially appointed officials, or adopt an annual salary system similar to the United States, and send it all at once according to the cost of living, to show excellence. (2) Transportation issues. In addition to striving for convenience in the preparation of transportation vehicles in Beijing, most members believe that according to the Constitution, the Legislative Yuan has four months of recess each year. The holidays are for members to go to the countryside to visit and seek out the sufferings of the people, and the regular collection of transportation expenses is a matter of course. (3) Housing issues. Since the new village has not yet started construction, the distribution problem is not yet to be discussed. There is only a slight dispute over the special treatment for single people and those with families. A few members at the meeting were very emotional about the pursuit of these two interests. It was also stated that if there are those who do not agree, it is the vested interests who sing a high tune, and they will be opposed by the majority of members. They appealed to face up to the national fatigue and the people's difficulties, and not to demand too much when there is no performance in the legislative task. A member shouted, "If you want to enjoy happiness and get rich, don't take the road of Legislative Members." As for the use of people, a few members advocated that each member can recommend one staff member, and some advocated that each member should have the right to appoint one reporter. The meeting had no conclusion by noon. Finally, it was decided that each of the 21 committees should recommend one member to form a small group, summarize the opinions of the members, and discuss the specific measures after drafting them, and then the meeting was adjourned.

### Currency Reform Has Been Planned for a Long Time; Dong Xian Guang Said That the Time of Implementation Cannot Be Announced Yet

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 2nd] Regarding the issue of currency reform, Director Dong answered reporters' questions at a press conference of the Information Bureau on the 2nd. The main points were: (1) The government has had a currency reform plan for a long time, but it is difficult to say when this plan will be implemented at present. (2) There is indeed a considerable amount of silver coins illegally circulating in the market, especially in the inland provinces. The government has already instructed the financial authorities of various provinces to prohibit the sale and purchase of silver coins, but it is legal for the people to purchase silver coins and sell them to the Central Bank.

(2) The exchange rate between Northeast Circulation Certificates and the legal currency is set at one yuan of Northeast Circulation Certificates to eleven yuan and five jiao of legal currency. (3) Remittances of Northeast Circulation Certificates to various places within the pass will be handled in the same manner as remittances of legal currency from various places within the pass to Shanghai. (4) Passengers entering the pass carrying Northeast Circulation Certificates are allowed to exchange them for legal currency at the designated Central Bank locations, according to the exchange rate and within the same limits as the amount of legal currency they could carry to Shanghai from locations within the pass. These regulations will take effect from the date of promulgation. The above revised regulations have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and were promulgated and implemented on May 31 of this year.

[Our Pan Yang (瀋陽) Dispatch on the 2nd] The Provisional Measures and Supplementary Measures for the Collection and Disbursement of Treasury Funds in the provinces and cities of Northeast China and Jehol will be repealed immediately by order of the Executive Yuan to the local authorities. In the future, the collection and disbursement of treasury funds in the Northeast will be handled in accordance with the Public Treasury Law. This is because, after the promulgation of the measures for the use and exchange of Northeast Circulation Certificates, legal currency can be used in the Northeast, and the special circumstances no longer exist.

[Our Pan Yang (瀋陽) Dispatch on the 2nd] There is no fundamental problem with changing the exchange rate between circulation certificates and legal currency to 1:11.5, but there are technical difficulties that need to be resolved. The central government has been consulted on this matter, so the change could not be made on the 1st. Furthermore, it is reported that the Ministry of Finance has specially ordered the Central Bank to temporarily allocate 300 billion legal currency for the emergency use of the Northeast Bandit Suppression General Political Committee.

Dr. Mayhew will be primarily responsible for providing recommendations to the Economic Cooperation Administration Director on how to use these funds.

[United Press Washington, 1st Dispatch] Hoffman revealed that the United States and China are discussing the establishment of a fifteen-member Agricultural Construction Committee, consisting of two Americans and three Chinese, to investigate China's needs in agricultural construction, while the Sherman Mission is studying urban areas and industrial plans.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 2nd] The Sino-American Relief Organization recently purchased 320 tons of seeds and 19 tons of agricultural implements, which were airlifted to Pan Yang and sent personnel to distribute them to farmers.

Editorial

### Learn from the Spirit of Mr. Lin Zexu!

The annual June 3rd Opium Suppression Day is upon us again! The Opium Suppression Day has three meanings: first, it signifies the suppression of opium and drugs as a major policy; second, it commemorates Mr. Lin Zexu, a statesman of the Qing Dynasty; and third, it raises awareness among Chinese people about health and uses this to change people's hearts and cleanse immoral customs. This year, the significance of Opium Suppression Day is particularly profound, and it appears with a brand-new meaning in terms of the mission of the times.

Opium and drugs are both narcotics, and narcotics are poisons. Their extensive scope includes opium, poppies, marijuana, morphine, cocaine, heroin, opium or morphine compound pills, and medications compounded to resist addiction. All of these are defined by law as opium and drug categories. From the perspective of ethnic survival, national health, and socio-economic considerations, opium and drugs are debilitating substances that are harmful and bring no benefit to national welfare and people's livelihoods. They not only anesthetize and kill the physical health of human beings, but also anesthetize and kill the hearts and souls of human beings. It is the black plague of the world for hundreds of years, as hateful as the red tide of communist ideology, because the poisoning of human beings by the two is the same in their harm and wrongdoing.

In terms of the influx of opium into our country, it has been around for more than a hundred years. From the Manchu Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China, the scourge of drugs has not only not been eliminated, but also marijuana, morphine, cocaine and other drugs have continued to arrive from overseas or border regions, infiltrating the mainland and spreading to poor villages. In particular, in the areas occupied by the communist bandits, they are even more blatant, openly transporting and selling drugs. Infinitely and ruthlessly, it has devastated the health of the population, destroyed the economy of the population, occupied cultivable land, and brought unparalleled disasters to mankind. This is the embrace of black scourge and red tide. It broke in the Northeast, it broke in the Central Plains. Wherever the red tide passes, where the beacon fire is, the black wind and black rain echo and arrive. Thus, opium and drugs and communist bandits have become the two evils of our country today. If their cruel harm and widespread spread are not eradicated, they will inevitably become the root of the disaster for the survival and glory of the Chinese nation and an obstacle to the future of human health and happiness.

To eradicate opium and drugs, like eradicating communist ideology and communist violence, it is necessary to have the vision and strategy of Mr. Lin Zexu, and it is necessary to have the perseverance and determination of Mr. Lin Zexu. Mr. Lin Zexu was a star of the glorious era of the Qing Dynasty. He was honest as an official, established achievements, and his scholarship, conduct, and morals followed the path of sages. During the reign of Daoguang, opium flowed into the country. In the eighteenth year, Huang Juezi, Secretary of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, submitted a memorial strongly advocating the prohibition of opium. The governors of various provinces debated and were undecided, but only Lin Zexu, Governor-General of Huguang, fully agreed with the opium prohibition proposal. He said: "If we still view it casually, it is to make it so that in a few decades, the Central Plains will have almost no soldiers to defend against the enemy, and no silver to fill the treasury. Thinking of this, how can we not tremble!" He had vision, recognizing the scourge of opium. He had determination, and immediately acted vigorously in the two lakes (Huguang), pioneering the opium prohibition trend.

The failure of the Opium War, Qishan said, was a failure of weapons, while Mr. Lin Zexu said, was a failure of thought. The failure of thought naturally leads to political failure. If the Qing court at that time could have trusted Lin without suspicion and given him the responsibility of handling opium, Lin would not have failed. We read Wei Yuan's (Moshi's) "Illustrated Treatise on the Maritime Kingdoms," and we can know that Mr. Lin Zexu was a great statesman with ideas and actions, and a political reformer. His world vision and diplomatic policies were beyond the reach of his contemporaries, and even more beyond the reach of Qishan and others. Later, when Xianfeng ascended the throne, he wrote comments criticizing the crimes of Qiying and others. He recognized Lin as a reformer of the generation, but unfortunately, Lin had already grown old and died. The greatness and success of Lin Zexu's life was that his thinking was progressive, he had foresight, he had strategy, and he was able to put it into practice. He was a great reformer and a great statesman who did not fail to "seize the time." His spirit and his deeds are always new with the times. He fought against the black scourge, he fought against the violence. He was a pioneer in modern Chinese history who truly strived to eradicate harmful ideologies! His opium prohibition determination can not only be used for today's public servants to learn; his reform determination, the courage to move forward without worrying about success or failure, is worth emulating by today's political reformers. The so-called political reform is a political disinfection work. If the red tide and black scourge in today's political phenomena are not swept away at the same time and eradicated with all our strength, then the poisoned thoughts will still continue to breed and expand. Mr. Lin Zexu used the eight characters "good weapons, skilled techniques, strong scouts, unified hearts" to suppress bandits, observe foreign insults, and prohibit opium. In terms of the meaning of the times, he was not behind Wang Yangming, Zhang Juzheng, and other previous sages. On today's Opium Suppression Day, we especially admire the greatness of Mr. Lin Zexu's personality and the depth of his learning, which is worth learning from throughout the country!

The Turning Point of Asian Economic Recovery - Expectations for the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East

The Third Conference of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East was opened on the 1st in Ooty, southern India. Eighteen units, including China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, Australia, the Philippines, New Zealand, India, Burma, Siam, Malaya, Pakistan, Ceylon, Hong Kong, Cambodia, and Laos, have sent representatives to attend. Indian Prime Minister Nehru inaugurated the meeting and delivered the opening address. In addition to reiterating India's adherence to the United Nations organization, he also emphasized the importance of Asian economic recovery. He said, "If we can achieve success in the economic field, it will not be difficult to achieve something in the political field." The purpose of the establishment of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East is to use the power of international cooperation to revive and develop this industrially backward Asia. Since the first conference was held in Shanghai in June last year, it has been actively engaged in design and planning work, and has collected information on the economic status of various Asian countries. The second conference was held in Tayao, Philippines, in December last year, and many resolutions were passed on the initial work of the conference. After the meeting, a general plan for Asian economic recovery was actively drafted and submitted to the third conference for final decision. Therefore, this conference is a turning point in Asia's economic recovery, and the rise and fall of the economies of various Asian countries is worthy of our attention.

Asia is still an economically backward region. Some countries are still in the stage of primitive social economy. Although some countries have industrialized, they still cannot keep pace with industrialized and advanced countries due to the oppression of the economic policies of the great powers. Therefore, before the Second World War, Asia was a source of raw materials and a sales place for commodities for industrially advanced countries in Europe and the United States, and fully exposed the colonial nature economically. During the Second World War, Asia suffered the most severely from the war. The Chinese War broke out before the European War, and the Pacific War also began in Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Malaya. The wounds caused by the war in various places are still vivid in our minds. To talk about economic recovery, it is indispensable to have international cooperation and strong support. The Second World War ended nearly three years ago, but in Asia and the Far East, not only has the economy of various countries not recovered, but also no country does not feel the shortage of consumer goods, especially the panic of food shortages. One billion residents of Asia are struggling on the verge of starvation. The United States has seen the economic difficulties in Europe and has concentrated on promoting its so-called Marshall Plan to aid Europe, but the United States may not have completely ignored the suffering of one billion people in Asia.

Moreover, the current economic difficulties of various Asian countries are really caused by Japan's launching of a war of aggression. The Sino-Japanese War lasted for eight years, and the Pacific War lasted for three or four years. The material losses suffered by various Asian countries are impossible to estimate, and the sacrifice of manpower is also difficult to estimate. After the war, various Asian countries painfully felt the shortage of manpower and materials, and they could not but be responsible for compensation! Although the Asian countries also advocate leniency towards the defeated Japan and are unwilling to demand too much, they must not sit idly by and watch the resurgence of the aggressive forces of the Japanese militarists, especially on the issue of Japan's compensation and the issue of industrial standards, they will never relax a step. Stahlecker's anti-compensation theory and Clap's non-compensation theory are all fallacies that cannot be accepted by Asian countries. Asian representatives should take this opportunity to urge the US government to reconsider its current policy towards Japan.

Although Asia today, like Europe, is mired in the deep continent of poverty, Asia has one billion people, accounting for half of the world's population, and its resources are abundant, inexhaustible, and inexhaustible. If Asian countries can make good use of the assistance of international cooperation, the Asian economy will not be difficult to advance and recover. It is expected that this economic conference will be able to complete the Asian economic recovery plan, but whether this plan can be fully implemented depends on two factors. First, for industrially advanced countries, they should change their old views on Asian countries in the past, immediately abandon their past imperialist economic policies, and fully stand on the economic position to help Asian countries recover and allow them to develop freely. Second, Asian countries should adhere to the supreme principle of "self-reliance" and strive for unity and cooperation among Asian countries to jointly devote themselves to economic recovery. We hope that this Asian and Far East Economic Conference can become a turning point in Asian economic recovery.

Recently, Chairman of Qing Province Ma Bufang telegraphed again requesting that it be included in Qing Province. When Director Zhu Shaoliang was stationed in Lanzhou during the war, he paid close attention to the problem. If this fertile land on the border of the four provinces is not surveyed and demarcated as soon as possible, there will be endless troubles in the future.

Shu used a knife to stab Mu more than ten times and then attempted suicide by electrocution, but failed. Neighbors reported the incident to the police. The injured party was sent to the hospital, and the perpetrator was arrested.

The Aura of Hope
〔Translated by Our Editorial Department〕Regardless of whether it is detrimental to Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, we cannot but admire his courage and sincerity because he is the first prominent Chinese to speak out against the anti-American agitation taking place in China. It is truly extraordinary that such a thing could happen in China.

The United States saved China during the war and has implemented several aid programs to China since Japan's surrender. However, we have discovered the strange phenomenon that Chinese people, directly following the propaganda line of the Communist Party, are working hard to attack the United States in the territory under the control of the National Government, and this is happening at a time when communism controls a large part of China's land.

If the students and newspapers busy with anti-American propaganda could shoulder the work of resisting communism, it might be more effective. This generation is playing the Communist Party's tricks, which are not particularly harmful to the United States, but are indeed harmful to the government they should be loyal to. Furthermore, they are endangering the entire theory of American aid to China.

Is it meaningful to select anti-American students from American-subsidized universities or other Chinese universities and send them to the United States, and have the United States pay for their advanced studies or other even worse activities? We raise this question for American officials in China to judge, believing that it will certainly leave a deep impression on them.

Is it meaningful to pour American money into China to support perhaps the most hostile elements towards the United States? This is certainly a more complex question, but we advocate for urgent and careful study of this issue.

At the same time, it is indeed very exciting to have a leader like Mr. Pan Gongzhan who understands the actual situation and is willing to express it frankly. The fact that this can happen is a sign of hope. Mr. Pan Gongzhan understands the basic situation, just as others should understand, and perhaps when they understand, it will be too late. His speech is a warning that some Chinese people have gone astray and that there is a risk of even worse things happening.

It is indeed very exciting to see a person (like an American) fully understand the danger of Japanese militarism, which the United States fought against, conquered, and disarmed, while at the same time being able to keep their mind clear and understand that the United States cannot shoulder the heavy burden of Japan forever. If the United States continues to bear this burden, it will certainly make it impossible for the United States to contribute to the rest of the world, including China. This should be obvious to anyone with intelligence and thought.

Mr. Pan Gongzhan's entire analysis of the Far East problem is accurate. He pointed out the United States' desire after the war to build China into the strongest country in the Far East and frankly admitted that this desire has encountered setbacks due to reasons beyond the United States' control. He fairly faced the Communist Party's deliberate attempt to weaken China's strategy, which is being assisted by the students' efforts to create ill will between China and the United States, while the United States only wants to strengthen China.

Finally, Mr. Pan Gongzhan faithfully set a basic principle, which is that becoming strong and united is the best answer for China to solve its current problems. Indeed, he could go further and say that this is the only answer. A weak, scattered, and aging China, biting the hand that feeds it with toothless gums, cannot generate power. What is needed is a young and reborn China, facing all problems and responsibilities with courage and solving them with wisdom. China has this quality. However, a part of her most promising talents, the students, seem to be腐爛 by germs, which should not have a place in their bodies.

Perhaps, given the position of the Ta Mei Wan Pao, it is inappropriate to boast too much about itself, but we still hope that readers will pay special attention to an article published by Mr. Wu Jiatang in the editorial column of this newspaper yesterday. Mr. Wu Jiatang is the editor-in-chief of the Ta Mei Wan Pao. He studied at St. John's University and later studied journalism at the University of Missouri. His ability to analyze the current malicious propaganda movement in China is almost unparalleled.

Mr. Wu is Chinese, but this does not make him hesitate to point out the danger of the current student sentiment. He correctly stated that this sentiment is complex and is not only anti-American but also anti-National Government, but due to the fear of being labeled as a "traitor," important officials have not expressed anything so far. (What is even more commendable is that Mr. Pan Gongzhan's statement closely followed Mr. Wu Jiatang's publication of this article.)

Mr. Wu Jiatang spoke honestly. He said that this movement is directed by the Communist Party, and we completely agree with this. This does not mean that everyone participating in this movement is a Communist, but today's anti-Americanism in China is the Communist Party's line. This movement is being staged by a small number of clever Communist strategists with the help of their "fellow travelers, leftists, and those who today in China take the middle road leaning to the left" (as Mr. Wu Jiatang said). This phenomenon is not only seen in China, but nowhere is it more extraordinary than here because the aid that China has obtained from abroad has come from the United States, and this country is today most reviled and attacked by those assumed to be Chinese intellectuals.

The movement shows a vicious cleverness by focusing on everything that touches on the emotional and psychological blindness of Chinese people using the method of focusing on Japanese militarism (as Mr. Wu Jiatang pointed out). Of course, no one can say that he is in favor of Japanese militarism. But those who are carrying out this completely dishonest movement can quickly put a guise on American economic aid to Japan that gives it the appearance of reviving Japanese militarism, thus making China's friendship with the United States seem to be selling out the country and supporting the revival of Japanese militarism. This is very touching for those with unclear minds, and the fact that it is actually nonsense is not immediately clear. It is not easy to find slogans of opposition.

Mr. Wu Jiatang narrated the entire argument, including the background of the Chinese official attitude towards defeated Japan, so excellently that it is a pity to only summarize it. If you have not read this article, then please take it out again and read it now. If China wants to solve her problems, then the Chinese people must do this themselves. People like Mr. Pan Gongzhan and Mr. Wu Jiatang, each in their own way, contribute to this kind of thinking and action, and only through this kind of thinking and action can China obtain her true dignity and status.

Six Western European Countries Agree to Establish an Organization for International Control of the Ruhr Area; West Germany to Implement Monetary Reform; Constituent Assembly to be Established in September; London Conference Announced to be Over
〔Reuters, London, 1st〕The London Six-Nation Conference discussing the German problem ended today. According to authoritative sources, the main achievements of the conference include: (1) Agreement to establish a German Constituent Assembly in the three occupied zones of West Germany around September 1st of this year. (2) The six countries of Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, together with representatives of West Germany, will organize an international organization to control the Ruhr industry, with distribution rights over the Ruhr's main production, especially coal and steel. (3) Agreement to implement monetary reform in the three zones of West Germany around July of this year, excluding the western sector of Berlin. In today's final meeting, the chief representatives of the six countries signed the report to be submitted to the governments of each participating country. It is expected that the conference's public announcement will be issued soon, and the resolutions passed at the meeting may also be announced soon.

〔Agence France-Presse, London, 1st〕The Six-Nation Conference on Germany completed its work today. Representatives of each country are currently drafting agreements to be submitted to their respective countries. It is understood that the full text of the agreement will be completed today after coordinating the most controversial points. The most controversial points include: (1) It is heard that the United States will yield to France's opinion regarding the Ruhr Control Committee enjoying greater advisory power. (2) Regarding the election of the German Constituent Assembly, the commanders of the occupying forces of each country will consult with the premiers of the German states regarding the electoral system in their proposals. It is heard that the agreement will specifically stipulate that the German electoral system should comply with the federal principles desired by France. It is also heard that the main contents of the Six-Nation Agreement on Germany being drafted today include: (1) Military occupation will continue after the establishment of the German interim government with Frankfurt as its capital. This military occupation can only be ended under a joint agreement signed by the Western powers. (2) Disarmament of Germany and dismantling of German military industries to ensure security. (3) The issue of international control over Ruhr industrial production, rather than Ruhr's own products, will be decided by an international organization with voting rights consisting of representatives from the six countries and West Germany. The West German representatives will be appointed by Britain and the United States, which occupy the Ruhr area, and later by France after merging with the above two areas. The international control organization will be established shortly before the German government takes office and will continue to exist after the withdrawal of the occupying forces. As for the standards for the distribution of Ruhr coal and coking coal to the Soviet Union, they will continue to be maintained, and the task of the international organization will be to prohibit cheating. The participation of each country in the international organization will not be affected by the fact that Germany is a beneficiary of the Marshall Plan. The German Constituent Assembly, after being elected in consultation with the German state parliaments, will draft the German constitution. This constitution, after being passed by two-thirds of the states, will be submitted to the authorities of the three occupying forces.

British Zone Authorities Denounce Soviet Policy in East Germany; Build Police State, Deprive People of Freedom
〔United Press, Berlin, 1st〕The political department of the British military government in Germany issued a statement on the evening of the 1st, denouncing the Soviet Union for cruelly building East Germany into a police state, where no individual rights exist. The article also stated that "Various forms of Soviet oppression have long been applied to the eastern occupied zone, and three important achievements have been obtained: (1) Eliminating the powerful Social Democratic Party; (2) Using the Free Democratic Party; (3) Suppressing the Christian Democratic Party, which had tried its best to resist Soviet and Communist control until the end of 1944 when the party leader was tricked away by Soviet orders."

After the factual elimination of all organized resistance to the Soviet plan, individual resistance becomes increasingly dangerous. After any resistance event occurs, it often leads to the arrest or escape of those responsible. The article is undoubtedly the strongest and most thorough condemnation of the Soviet Union ever issued by the Western government in Germany. The British authorities also stated that the degree of terror felt by the people of East Germany is so great that the Soviet Union's "oppression has absolute control."

Czech Voters Abstain; 450,000 People; American Newspaper Writes in Praise
〔Reuters, Prague, 1st〕Reliable sources estimate that 450,000 people abstained from voting in the general election over the weekend. Those who abstain without sufficient reason may be sentenced to imprisonment or fined up to 10,000 crowns. The right to punish lies with the National Committee of the local authorities. Among the spoiled ballots and abstainers, tens of thousands were people who were purged by the Action Committee and unable to vote.

〔Central News Agency, New York, 1st〕The press here deeply admires the Czech people who cast blank votes in the Czech election despite the Communist Party's threats. They say that this proves that the Czech people are unwilling to submit to totalitarian rule and that the situation behind Stalin's iron curtain is not very stable.

French Premier Wins Parliamentary Confidence; Faces New Crisis
〔Our News〕London, 3rd Broadcast: Paris News, although the Schuman cabinet won a majority vote of confidence yesterday, it faced a new crisis today. The National Assembly proposed an amendment advocating occupational security for dismissed civil servants. The cabinet cannot agree to this point.

〔Reuters, Paris, 1st〕The National Assembly recently passed a vote of confidence in Premier Schuman with 402 votes against 183. Only Communist Party members voted against it. This is the seventh vote of confidence Premier Schuman has won since taking office six months ago.

〔Reuters, Paris, 2nd〕Although the Schuman government has won a vote of confidence in the National Assembly, it is still in danger of being forced to collapse because Finance Minister Mayer is still dissatisfied with the plan to dismiss 150,000 civil servants to reduce government spending. He believes that this plan was produced after various parties negotiated on their own over the weekend. He stated that unless the goal of truly reducing spending can be achieved, he will not hesitate to resign.

〔Reuters, London, 1st〕The hope for the restoration of peace in the Holy Land suddenly became strong because Israel and the Arab League simultaneously accepted the Security Council's ceasefire order. Both parties submitted satisfactory replies to the Security Council before the deadline of 11:00 PM today.

While Arab leaders were still discussing in Amman, the Israeli interim government ordered all Jewish troops to cease fire at 3:00 AM local time on the 2nd, but stated that Arab troops must also cease fire at the same time. The Israeli government's statement said: "Israel's issuance of a ceasefire order is due to the fact that: (1) During the ceasefire period, the arms embargo on Arab countries should apply to foreign armaments existing in Arab countries; (2) During the ceasefire period, the armies of both sides should not go beyond the areas they currently occupy, and each side must maintain its current position." Shortly after Israel's reply was announced, Lake Success announced that the Arab League had also accepted the Security Council's ceasefire order. The Syrian representative Curry, who is the rotating chairman of the Security Council this month, received a telegram from the Arab countries announcing the Arab countries' acceptance of the ceasefire proposal and promising to submit a detailed reply later. Curry has officially notified the United Nations Secretary-General and other members of the Security Council of the Arab countries' acceptance. Earlier, the United Nations Palestine mediator Bernadotte expressed optimism about the Arab countries' acceptance of the ceasefire order after flying to Amman and Cairo to meet with Arab leaders. Bader discussed with King Abdullah and Jordanian Prime Minister Ulfeck in Amman for three hours.

Arab League Accepts Ceasefire Order; Insists on Canceling Israel; Fierce Debate Expected at Security Council on Ceasefire Issue
〔Our News〕New York, 2nd Broadcast: Lake Success News, the Arab countries have accepted the United Nations' proposal for a four-week ceasefire, but insist that Palestine must remain intact and be controlled by Arab countries, that the State of Israel must be abolished, and that Jewish immigration must be restricted. If this point cannot be achieved, the war will resume after four weeks. As for the ceasefire date, the Arab side believes that it must be when the Arab countries have a grasp of the overall situation. It is expected that a fierce debate will occur at today's Security Council meeting regarding the different interpretations of the ceasefire proposal by the Arab and Jewish sides. Also, Arab forces are still fiercely attacking Jewish positions in various parts of Palestine today.

〔Reuters, Tel Aviv, 2nd〕Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok solemnly stated today that if the Arabs disregard the Israeli government's interpretation of the Security Council's ceasefire order, the war in Palestine will continue. If the Arabs want more war, they may as well enjoy it more.

Markos Broadcasts Three Conditions; Demands End to Greek Civil War; American Diplomacy Pays Close Attention to This
〔Agence France-Presse, Athens, 1st〕The Athens Free Greece Radio announced yesterday that General Markos is willing to end the bloodshed in Greece. The interim Greek government is constantly prepared to accept and encourage any motive in order to help Greece recover and achieve tranquility. Athens views this announcement as a real offer of peace. Deputy Prime Minister Tsaldais immediately replied, saying that "Guerrillas must choose between complete annihilation and unconditional surrender." The conditions proposed by Markos for the final peace talks are: (1) Guarantee of democratic life; (2) Abolition of foreign intervention; (3) Guarantee of the sovereignty and independence of the Greek people, so that the Greek people can determine their future alone and without restraint.

〔Agence France-Presse, Washington, 1st〕It is believed here that the recent reports from Athens, saying that Markos is demanding an end to the Greek civil war, may be a test of whether the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union can be changed. Although officials here emphasize that Markos's decision is due to the recent victories of the Greek government forces, they also believe that the recent reduction in the military strength of the Greek guerrillas may be due to the reduced support given by Greece's northern neighbors and the Soviet Union. Officials pointed out that if this is indeed the case, then there is hope for an improvement in US-Soviet relations. However, the American diplomatic community is very skeptical about the possibility of a Greek truce. The United States may even use pressure to obtain a truce, but it will certainly oppose the legal existence of the Greek Communist Party. Diplomats also believe that although the easing of the Greek situation may improve relations between Washington and Moscow, a truly thorough improvement still depends on the resolution of cases in Berlin, Vienna, and other places.

US-Japan Cotton Trade; To be Signed Within Ten Days
〔United Press, Tokyo, 2nd〕Allied officials said on the 2nd that Japan's 60 million yuan cotton loan will be signed within ten days, but only a small portion of it can be used immediately to purchase American raw cotton.

Japanese Government Requests Police Increase
〔Reuters, Tokyo, 2nd〕The government will soon submit a bill to the Diet requesting that the number of Japanese national police be increased from 30,000 to 50,000. The bill also stipulates cooperation between the national police and the local police. According to recent riots in Shanghai and Osaka, this is due to a lack of such cooperation.

Hodge Makes Three Suggestions to Korean Parliament; Rhee Syngman Expresses Indignation; Believes US Military Should Not Interfere in Parliamentary Affairs
〔United Press, Seoul, 2nd〕South Korean National Assembly Chairman Rhee Syngman said today that US military commander Hodge, who had previously stated that he would not interfere in parliamentary affairs, suddenly submitted three suggestions to the Assembly yesterday, which has aroused widespread indignation.

Hodge's letter includes the plan of the Korean parties, and the parties had predicted that the new government would only be a puppet of the United States in the future. Unfortunately, this has been said. The Assembly has established a group to review the letter. At the same time, Hodge told reporters today that the letter was not an order, but only suggested three things: (1) Retain a considerable number of seats in preparation for accommodating legally elected North Korean representatives in the future; (2) Organize a liaison group to contact the United Nations agency to promote the establishment of an independent Korean government; (3) Avoid easily passing the constitution, lest it create a government that is not suitable for Korean needs and psychology.

〔Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 2nd〕The South Korean National Assembly continued to hotly debate the selection of ten members of the Constitution Drafting Committee on the second day of the meeting today. The committee will draft the new South Korean constitution, and the future South Korean government will be formed based on this constitution. Today, some speakers in the Assembly strongly opposed this approach, believing that the selection of members of the committee should not be based on provinces, but should be based on their individual legal knowledge and experience.

After the Arab and Jewish Parties Accept the Ceasefire; Fighting in the Holy Land Continues; Jewish Troops Suddenly Invade Outer Jordan After Announcing the Ceasefire
〔Reuters, Haifa, 2nd〕The British authorities here confirmed at noon today that although the Jewish and Arab parties have accepted the ceasefire, the war in Palestine has not stopped. Gunfire can still be heard in Jerusalem, and the Jewish and Arab armies continue to fight for the new city area.

Arab troops have moved to the high ground overlooking the new city area in the past two days. The 90,000 Jews in the area lack food and water, and their situation is like that of the Jews in the old city of Jerusalem before they surrendered. British reports state that the Arab army is determined not to allow the Jewish army in Jerusalem to benefit from the ceasefire. The commander of the Arab army on the Jerusalem line has an order to wait for the situation in Lake Success to clear before stopping firing.

Municipal Government Reviews the Recent Incident; Invites All Sectors to Hold a Discussion Meeting; Communist Elements Confirmed to Have Infiltrated the Student Unrest and Engaged in Activities; Mayor Proposes Several Common Solutions
〔Our Report〕Regarding the recent brawl incident at the Shanghai Law College caused by cartoons, the Municipal Government held a discussion meeting with responsible persons from all sectors at the Municipal Assembly Hall at 4 PM yesterday, and publicly displayed the torn-down cartoons from the Shanghai Law College. Mayor Wu presided over the discussion meeting. Attendees included Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Yu, Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Committee, Xuan Wuwu, Garrison Commander, Zeng Shuping, Police Commissioner, Li Zhaomou, Director of the Education Bureau, Chu Yiyi, President of the Shanghai Law College, Cheng Xiaogang, President of Jiaotong University, Ling Xianyang, President of Soochow University, Zhu Jingnong, President of Aurora University, Ou Yuanhuai, President of Great China University, and dozens of responsible persons from related organizations. First, Mayor Wu stated that the purpose of the discussion meeting was to review and decide on appropriate handling measures. Then, President Chu of Shanghai Law College reported on the facts of the incident. It has now been determined that the two students in charge of the cartoon exhibition were Liu Nong and Yao Jinghan. Liu Nong and others were detained by the police. President Chu confirmed that the brawl was indeed caused by the intrusion of outside students. Mayor Wu then stated that this matter is related to the future stability of Shanghai, and he hoped that all sectors would express their opinions on whether the students involved in the incident should be expelled and dealt with severely according to the law.

Commander Xuan's Speech: Schools That Should Be Paid Attention To
Commander Xuan's speech stated: When May arrived, the authorities anticipated that this year's student unrest would be more intense than in the past because the Communist bandits' external organizations around various schools had become well-established, and all activities were initiated by them. Most schools were caught in the whirlpool, and what was especially terrible was that a large number of young students were deceived and anesthetized. He has a son who is not a Communist and is currently a student at Jiaotong University. He guarantees that his son is definitely not a Communist and will never join the Communist Party in the future. However, after talking with him, it was proven that his thinking had long been influenced by the Communist Party and that he was defending the Communist Party everywhere. Commander Xuan stated that this is the most terrible phenomenon and hoped that educators would pay attention to it. He also announced the schools that should be paid attention to at present. The national ones are: Jiaotong, Fudan, Tongji, and Jinan. The private ones are: St. John's, Shanghai Law, Great China, Datong, and Aurora Universities.

Xu Jiqi and Fang Zhi Both Gave Angry Speeches
Next, Vice Speaker Xu Jiqi gave a speech, stating that he has been a school board member of Shanghai Law College for 20 years, but has never been to the school. Today, he saw such inhuman cartoons and was very displeased. He hoped that the school would investigate and severely punish the chairman of the exhibition and thoroughly eliminate all illegal activities. Otherwise, even if the school is disbanded, it would not be a pity. He also suggested immediately convening a school board meeting to discuss handling measures.

Chairman Fang was the most angry yesterday. He gave a half-hour speech, stating that the current widespread anti-American movement among young people is entirely instigated by the Communist bandits. He can determine that the cartoons at Shanghai Law College were created by Communist underground workers. Therefore, if Shanghai Law College wants to continue to maintain its past history, its president must be responsible for handing over the active students. The students of the school should also automatically report the organizers of the cartoon exhibition. Chairman Fang also stated that any school that cannot control its students can be disbanded. Because we cannot allow these political professional students to continue to disrupt social and political stability, causing the future of education to be ruined.

Attack the Mind is Paramount
Cheng Xiaogang, President of Jiaotong University, stated: Students often ask the school for freedom of speech, and the authorities are also willing to give students freedom. However, the difficulty lies in the fact that the result of allowing them freedom is a one-sided trend, and all speeches are anti-government and anti-reality. He doubts why no students are willing to speak for the government and believes that this is the most worrying thing. Because tearing down the cartoons is superficial, the main thing is to remove the psychological morbidity, otherwise education will be completely bankrupt.

Mayor Wu also believed that President Cheng's opinion was very correct. He said: "Attacking the city is inferior, attacking the mind is paramount." He admitted that the current method is the inferior strategy of attacking the city, but at present, we have no choice but to do so.

Mayor Summarizes Four Points of Common Understanding
Mayor Wu finally summarized everyone's opinions and summarized them into the following four points of common understanding: (1) The Shanghai Law College incident proves that Communist elements have indeed infiltrated the current student unrest to carry out political work. (2) Most students in the school are good, and they do not want these troublemakers to exist. (3) A small number of Communist Party members are indeed a factor of social instability. They are causing trouble in the education sector, leading to brawls and disputes. (4) These Communist elements must be severely cracked down on after they are caught.

Based on the above four points of common understanding, Mayor Wu proposed the following common solutions: (1) Requirements for schools: A. In the future, students in each school must obtain permission from the school authorities before holding meetings, otherwise the chairman of the meeting must be fully responsible, and the participating students must also be severely punished. B. There is a consistent phenomenon in the student unrest in each school, that is, the students of the school did not cause trouble, but there were outside students who broke in to instigate trouble. In the future, the school should prohibit students from other schools from entering, and immediately notify the police to crack down on them. (2) Hopes for the government: Communist elements must be severely punished. If there are students who shout grievances for them, they must be Communist tails, and the government will not hesitate to crack down on them all thoroughly. (3) Hopes for social public opinion: The government must be supported and assisted, and parents are expected to pay attention to their children's actions. In the future, parents can be asked to take back their children who cause trouble.

Publishing World on My Humble Work, "Chronological Biography of Xin Jiaxuan" by Zheng Qian

On April 29th of this year, this publication's issue number 109 carried an article by Mr. Chang Mo, reviewing Mr. Deng Guangming's "Chronological Biography of Xin Jiaxuan." There was a passage that concerned my previous work, which read as follows:

"Last winter, a friend in Beiping bought me a copy of Mr. Mo's *Chronological Biography of Jiaxuan*. In Shanghai, I also bought Xu Jiarui's *Critical Biography of Jiaxuan*. After a little perusal, I felt that it was 'going from bad to worse.'"

Whether one should read a book bought from afar carefully or just "peruse it a little" is a matter of personal freedom, and others should not interfere. However, to arbitrarily use the old saying "going from bad to worse" after only a "little perusal" is something others cannot silently accept. Due to space constraints, I cannot write much, so I will briefly explain the following points.

First, Mr. Deng's biography was published in the winter of 1947, while my humble work was published in the summer of 1938. Before my work, there were five chronological biographies of Jiaxuan: (1) compiled by Xin Qitai, (2) compiled by Liang Qichao, (3) compiled by Chen Si, (4) compiled by Xiong Shangmu (?), and (5) compiled by Long Muxun. These five biographies largely failed to thoroughly investigate major events in Jiaxuan's life and career, and very few of the dates are correct. Moreover, there are even fewer records of anecdotes, forgotten deeds, and interactions with friends. I have extensively corrected and supplemented these in my humble work. All five biographies have printed editions in circulation, which can be checked. I do not understand what the so-called "going from bad to worse" refers to. If Mr. Chang Mo possesses or has seen a more detailed work than these five biographies, I would certainly like to read it. However, I can assert that Mr. Chang Mo cannot produce such a book.

Second, in general, Mr. Deng's biography is indeed more detailed and thorough than my humble work. However, regarding the dating of major events in Jiaxuan's life, including the major episodes of "twice appointed as military commander and thrice sent as imperial envoy" mentioned in Mr. Chang Mo's article, the two biographies are nineteen out of twenty the same. In some places, Mr. Deng's biography has more ample evidence and richer materials; in other places, the opposite is true. Regarding the collection and verification of Jiaxuan's anecdotes, forgotten deeds, and interactions with friends, the two biographies vary in detail, with some things he has that I do not, and vice versa. Overall, the Deng and Zheng biographies are roughly the same regarding important events, with occasional differences in minor details. Whether it's major or minor events, where the two biographies differ, some are my mistakes, and some are Mr. Deng's omissions.

Third, I have compared Mr. Deng's biography and my humble work year by year, and there are 140-150 points of difference in detail. There are at least fifty or sixty cases that absolutely prove that I am correct where Mr. Deng is mistaken, or that I am more detailed where Mr. Deng is brief. Could it be that Mr. Chang Mo has not discovered any of these? Therefore, I doubt whether he has truly read my humble work.

Fourth, besides my humble work and the five older biographies, Mr. Deng's biography does indeed have some original contributions. However, they are definitely not the ones Mr. Chang Mo mentioned, as these are all present in my humble work, although Mr. Deng's account is more detailed in two or three cases. Although his original text includes the phrase "and so on, the examples are too numerous to mention," since he gave examples, why not cite the truly original contributions? Therefore, Mr. Chang Mo's attitude toward reading my humble work is too careless and hasty. Even for Mr. Deng's biography, which he "greatly admires" and specifically wrote an article to review, he is "apparently" completely clueless as to where the good lies.

The facts mentioned above cannot be exemplified in detail within the confines of this publication, and it would also be inconsistent with the nature of this publication. I plan to write a separate article and submit it to a more specialized publication.

Mr. Deng's biography was published ten years later than my humble work, but Mr. Deng's biography was delayed by the Commercial Press for nearly ten years before it was published. We wrote these books in the same place at the same time. At that time, Mr. Deng and I often met at the National Beiping Library. He worked on his, and I worked on mine. My first draft was completed earlier, and Mr. Deng had seen the entire manuscript of my first draft before he finished his draft. This was mentioned in the editorial notes of Mr. Deng's biography. What he was referring to was this first draft. The one that was later printed and circulated, which Mr. Chang Mo "perused a little" and criticized as "going from bad to worse," was the revised manuscript. The revision benefited greatly from Mr. Deng's inspiration and help. The postscript to my humble work contains the line, "Mr. Deng Gongsan helped me correct and amend errors, which was of great benefit." Gongsan was Mr. Deng's style name.

For both Mr. Deng and me, this chronological biography is an old work from ten years ago. We certainly put in a lot of effort at the time, but now it is inevitably prone to some errors. This is a natural truth; otherwise, wouldn't we be making no progress as we get older? I especially believe that neither Mr. Deng nor I had the intention of using this book to compete for fame, because I am confident and know that Mr. Deng has other academic work besides studying Xin Jiaxuan. It is only Mr. Chang Mo's careless and reckless attitude that makes me feel uneasy. Leaving aside personal feelings, from an academic standpoint, I cannot help but express my regret.

Christianity and Democracy by Fu Tongxian

*Puritanism and Democracy*, by R. B. Perry, The Vanguard Press, New York, XVI + 688 pp., $5.00, 1944

This book is a theoretical work that elucidates the highest founding principles of the United States. In other words, the main purpose of this book is to explain the national philosophy of the United States. The original title was "Puritanism and Democracy." Because Puritanism is probably not very clear in the minds of the average Chinese reader, I reluctantly used "Christianity" as a substitute, but it does not have the precise meaning of the original title. This book was originally a lecture manuscript for the "American Ideal" course taught by Professor Perry at Harvard University and was published in 1944. At that time, World War II was nearing its end, and American victory was in sight. American thinkers were asking: "What should we do in the future?" "When we look to the future, how will we look back on the past?" In other words, "How much does the past contribute to the future?" Perry quoted the American philosopher James as saying: "The effort of the history of philosophy lies in how to reconcile the misunderstandings of the past with the hopes of the future." Therefore, the author's work is to faithfully understand the thoughts of the past on the one hand, and to relate them to future development through current analysis and review on the other hand.

The traditional foundation of the United States is the Declaration of Independence by President Jefferson, the essence of which is:

"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."

On the inside cover of the book, the author specifically quotes President Jefferson's famous saying: "Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God." Therefore, the highest principle of the founding of the United States is to respect individual rights and bear individual responsibilities. The reason for the existence of the government is to ensure that the people living under this government can enjoy reasonable benefits and respect their wise judgment.

This principle is the crystallization of the two mainstreams of Puritanism and democracy in the American tradition. These two mainstreams have influenced and intertwined with each other in the American tradition. At one period, one mainstream dominates; at another period, another mainstream dominates. But the two always interact and complement each other. According to Perry, Puritanism includes five factors: (1) medieval Christianity; (2) this Christianity is Protestant; (3) Calvinist Protestantism; (4) Congregational and Presbyterian churches under Calvinism; (5) Puritan theocracy. Its main spirit is to oppose luxury, distrust authority, deny the necessity of any intermediaries between God and man, insist on the dignity of mankind and personal responsibility, and strictly abide by moral discipline. Democracy includes three factors: (1) Freedom - that is to say, the organization of society should enable the full development of the abilities of all individuals according to their own choices, and enable all individuals to enjoy the greatest possible happiness; the organization between countries should fully develop the greatest function of each country and its people. (2) Equality - that is to say, human beings are endowed with the same reason and conscience and the necessary natural resources, and everyone should have equal opportunities to develop their personal intelligence, so everyone should be able to have equal gains; in politics, individuals have equal rights to manage the government and equal rights to obtain common welfare. (3) Fraternity - that is, mutual respect, cooperation and mutual assistance. The main spirit of democracy is to tolerate and reconcile different opinions and seek consensus, respect reason and conscience, and tend towards a harmonious world. According to Perry, modern democracy is to establish a fair and humane national order based on a totalitarian individualism. The so-called totalitarian individualism is to advocate that the individual's responsibility is to seek the happiness of all individuals.

Both Puritanism and democracy recognize the dignity of mankind and the value of the individual; both oppose traditional authority; both advocate that disobeying certain people is sometimes obeying God. But the two also have different places: one focuses on religious morality, advocating a serious and realistic life, recognizing the current unstable situation of mankind from a pessimistic standpoint; one focuses on political and social aspects, advocating an experimental and adventurous life, and confirming mankind's future hope and unlimited development from an optimistic standpoint. These two aspects of differences are enough to remedy the shortcomings of both sides. When combined, it becomes a kind of American outlook on life, or simply Americanism.

This Americanism is the crystallization of America's past tradition and the lighthouse of its future evolution. Therefore, Professor Perry said: "Puritanism and democracy form the content of the American social heritage. The main spiritual resource of a country must be her own past heritage, but we must constantly have new discoveries and new revisions. If a country fundamentally denies her own tradition, then she will lose her historical uniqueness and destroy her main spiritual vitality; if a country only clings tightly to her past tradition, then she will be corrupt, stubborn, reactionary and not forward. As for whether we need revolution or improvement? This is not a problem, because we still have a third way - that is, to embrace a spirit of loyalty that is clear about right and wrong, brave and energetic."

This point can be used as a reference for the evolution of our Chinese culture.

Nature and Life by Shufeng

Original Author: J. Huxley, Translator: Wang Weihua, Publisher: Zhonghua Book Company

It is a common and most undesirable phenomenon that general students do not feel any interest in bitter and dry science books, and cannot fully understand the explanations of science teachers in schools and accept the instillation of scientific knowledge. The reason is that most science books are either too specialized and too profound, or they are not detailed enough, so that instructors have no way to start teaching, or students find them tasteless and unrewarding after reading, which instead leads to a phenomenon of ignoring and disliking this subject like giving up eating for fear of choking. It completely loses the original meaning of science education.

"Nature and Life" is a supplementary reading material of scientific common sense written specifically for this phenomenon. The first collection includes knowledge in various aspects of physics, chemistry and biology, but knowledge of agricultural science and geology, meteorology, etc. is still lacking, so the sequel was written to supplement the lack of the first collection.

Because the knowledge discussed is different, although it is a sequel, it can also independently become a scientific book with a novel compilation. Not only that, the content can also be divided into four independent units.

1. About the Earth:

Including Chapter 1 "The Earth and Climate" and Chapter 2 "The Cause and History of the Earth."

2. About Biology: Including Chapter 3 "The Chemistry of Life," Chapter 6 "The Occurrence and Trend of Life," and Chapter 7 "The Evolution of Biology."

3. About Agriculture:

Including Chapter 4 "Soil" and Chapter 5 "Agriculture."

4. About discussing science:

Including Chapter 8 "History of Science" and Chapter 9 "Science and Concepts."

These four independent units are actually very closely related. The author first talks about the various situations on the earth to the climate, and then talks about the influence of climate on animals and plants, and then extends to the relationship between the chemical elements needed in life and agriculture, and uses new perspectives to explain the science of mud and the importance of mud and fertilizer, as the basis for discussing the occurrence, reproduction and Mendel's genetics of biology. Finally, the steps of scientific progress, scientific theories, concepts and discoveries are summarized. To achieve the purpose of introducing scientific knowledge.

A science book as thick as more than 300 pages, always discusses the various situations in the natural world in a relaxed, easy-to-understand and interesting touch, and starts with various natural phenomena encountered in daily life. From shallow to deep, from the simplest scientific knowledge to advanced agricultural science and the evolution of biology. Many interesting statistics and pictures are inserted in this process, which makes this book harvest the effect of getting twice the result with half the effort.

The various natural sciences described in this book are inseparable from the relationship with "life," so that readers can fully understand the reasons for various phenomena in daily life, and it is indeed the most appropriate supplementary reading material for science.

Introducing "A Comprehensive Dictionary of English Usage" by Zeren

Compiled by Ge Chuanzheng, published by Jingwen Book Company

The reason why I want to introduce "A Comprehensive Dictionary of English Usage" is that it is different from the general dictionaries or dictionaries on the market. What is talked about inside focuses especially on the words and languages that Chinese people are prone to use incorrectly, misunderstand or ignore. As the editor said, "It is the only English usage dictionary made by Chinese people specifically for Chinese people." Because Chinese language and English language are very different, the use of words is different, and the grammar is also different. Therefore, the words that English and Americans are prone to use incorrectly, Chinese people may not use them incorrectly. On the contrary, the words that English and Americans find unquestionable, Chinese people often misunderstand. Some words have similar meanings, but their usage is different. This point is often not explained in enough detail in general dictionaries, but we can get a satisfactory answer in this book.

Now let the recorder give a few examples.

For example, on page 95, it is written under "blame": (1) In general English-Chinese dictionaries, "blame" is mostly annotated as "to blame" or "to criticize," etc. In fact, "blame him" does not mean "to punish him" or "to criticize him," but just to blame him in the heart...

(2) To say "someone is at fault" or "someone deserves to be blamed," it is usually said "to blame" and rarely said "to be blamed"...

For example, page 72 "attention" note (2):

"Pay attention to" is interpreted as "to pay attention," and sometimes it is also interpreted as "to court (a woman)." "Pay his attention to" is only interpreted as "to court (a woman)." Note that the first phrase uses the singular form "attention" without words such as "his," and the second phrase uses the plural form "attentions" with words such as "his."

In short, this is an indispensable tool book for learning English. It tells about English idioms and usage issues anytime and anywhere, not only makes readers use fewer wrong words, but also further understands the words.

"My Land, My People" by Shi Jimei

Author: Dar Ting Nichols, Translator: Yuan, Publisher: Cultural Life Publishing House

"My Land, My People" is a film script that tells us how fragile people become strong under the shadow of Nazi demons and the power of invaders during World War II, and how human rights and truth are regarded as more precious than life.

The story of "My Land, My People" takes place in a city in a certain country in Europe, in fact, maybe in every city in every country.

The swastika flag flutters on the top of the city hall, in front of the propaganda book title "Trust the Germans," German soldiers with bayonets patrol, the whole city is dead, except for the Nazi soldiers who are as fierce as wolves.

The mayor's only way to preserve the "responsibility" of life in this city is to "cooperate" with the occupying authorities. On this day, he was ordered by Major General Feng Keller, the commander of the occupying army, to go to the school to "revise" textbooks and check "banned books." Professor Su Lai'er, the principal of the school, is a scholar who loves truth and freedom. He believes that the books in people's hearts and the truth in people's hearts can never be burned by invaders - he told this to his teachers.

The male teacher, Albert Laurie, is the only son of a widow. Because he is too spoiled and loved, he is weak and incompetent, timid and afraid of things, and very shy. He silently adores Louise Martin, his neighbor and also his colleague; but he does not dare to confess his love. Louise is a insightful and persuasive woman. Her fiancé, George Lambert, and her younger brother, Paul, all work at the train station.

Major General Feng Keller, the commander of the occupying army, is a scheming conspirator. He discovered many "sabotage acts," such as secret newspapers and train derailments, so he is working hard to find those "destroyers." George Lambert, who works for the tiger, is helping him. Louise does not know that her fiancé is spineless; she is only angry because her younger brother, Paul, has been mixing with German soldiers recently.

But things always come to light. The cellar where the secret newspaper was printed was searched, and the machines and workers were escorted onto military trucks. Major General Feng Keller sat in a car with the mayor. Suddenly, a bomb fell from a high place, killing two soldiers - two substitutes for the mayor and the major general. The murderer climbed up and down on the roof, and escaped the tracking of the German soldiers. He passed through the backyard of the Laurie's house, and was seen by the strange old woman, who saw his injured and bleeding arm - it was Paul Martin. When he returned home, Louise had just returned from school. She was sad and happy, and her eyes were filled with tears, because Paul was really the brother she had always been proud of.

Albert Laurie, this incompetent mouse, would not have any so-called "sabotage acts," but the German soldiers found a secret newspaper on him, so he was also arrested. - Mrs. Laurie lost her son, which is equivalent to losing everything in the world. She ran to George Lambert to inform - Paul Martin is the murderer of the assassination; George told the mayor again. In this way, Albert came out of prison, and Paul was finished.

Albert found that Louise no longer cared about him, and Paul's sacrifice was the price of his release. In a kind of crazy grief and hatred, he ran to the train station to find George Lambert. In the office, he was stunned

It turned out that George had committed suicide, dead on the ground, with blood and a pistol beside his body... So he was arrested again.

How can there be beautiful sparks without beating iron! This arrest brought courage and perseverance to Albert. He saw innocent people die, and strength and courage grew into his character all at once. As long as the truth in people's hearts remains, there will be light in the darkness; as long as the truth in people's hearts remains, there will be courage everywhere...

The result of the trial was that Albert was declared innocent.

He returned to school and read a very good book to the children. It was written on a passionate night in 1789 by several people who loved truth and freedom, "Declaration of Human Rights." His voice was clear and strong, reading sentence by sentence. The door of the classroom was opened. Wolf-like German soldiers arrested him; Louise, with tears in her eyes, continued to read the book that was left behind...

If Louise also left, someone else would continue to read, because the truth cannot be destroyed or burned.

This is just a very ordinary story, played by several very ordinary people. They are not only people in the book, but also real people

Therefore, the story played by these small people in the great era is not a drama that deceives people to cry and laugh, nor is it a clever arrangement that the author deliberately wants to move people, but a straightforward story with affection and reason. Although the time and scenery depicted in this story are not very close to us, we are facing an era where turmoil is almost everywhere at any time. Our views on truth, rights, freedom, war, and peace will be better understood and more deeply understood after reading "My Land, My People."

Driver Picked Up Money and Donated the Thank You Money to Charity

Dear Sirs: I am the driver of No. 163 of Xiang Sheng Automobile Company in this city. On May 18th, a customer, Mr. Yu, lost a gold bar (about ten taels) in the car. When I returned to the station, I found it and sent the gold bar to the general office of this company to be claimed. Later, Mr. Qiong came to this company to inquire. After investigation by Manager Zhang and Director Pan, it was confirmed and returned. Mr. Yu thanked me for picking up money and not hiding it, and rewarded me with 10 million national currency, and published a thank you in the newspaper the next day. This is the process. However, I think that I am a worker, and I can only make a living on weekdays, so I am powerless to do various charity activities. This time, I unexpectedly got this huge amount of money, and I am willing to donate it to charity. Although it is a matter of borrowing flowers to offer Buddha, I also want to repay my long-cherished wish. Now I send 10 million national currency to donate to your newspaper's "Poor Women's Childbirth Assistance." Please check and accept it!

Sincerely,

Zhang Yuanfa

Free Talk Introducing Wu Jiayuan's Substitute Words by Feng Zikai

My artist friend Mr. Wu Jiayuan sent me three new poems, copied below:

(1)
   Zhen fish kill eating,
   Can't take care of the hook.

(2)
   Own sound is the best to listen to,
   Not the same as other orioles.

(3)
   The small animals in the pond have never seen the world,
   Eels and loaches promote it as king.

I felt something different when I read it; but I clearly understood that the first poem meant "That fish is so eager to eat, it doesn't care about the hook." (The rest of the readers will definitely understand.) I think the poems are very good, and the metaphors are just right. But that's not what I want to talk about now. What I want to talk about is the "substitute words" he created. I remember when he came to Hangzhou to see me last spring, he told me that he wanted to create this kind of simplified character. At that time, he told me a few examples, for example, the two characters of bank can be written together as a character with the radical "walking person" and the character "艮". The two characters of currency can be written together as the character "化" with a character "巾" underneath. The two characters of marriage can be written together as the radical "auspicious" with the character "昏". ... I expressed my approval. Then we didn't talk about it again. Unexpectedly, this time he has already used these characters in his poems, and also sent me a mimeographed "Draft of Substitute Word List". When I flipped through it, there were three thousand and several hundred "substitute words" inside, arranged in the method of a dictionary. In the past year, he has launched a full-scale attack on Chinese characters, and has simplified the phrases that can be simplified into characters. I think this draft table is very valuable for research, discussion and promotion. Because this kind of substitute word can be understood at a glance without learning. And when writing, when typesetting, it can save a lot of labor and save a lot of space. In today's busy society, the simpler the tool of writing, the better. Therefore, this kind of substitute word is really good news for the improvement of Chinese characters. Of course, Jiayuan's draft is still in its initial stage and needs to be studied by comrades who care about this matter in the country. I have more than enough enthusiasm for this matter, but not enough ability, so I can only write this introduction after feeling inspired to announce it to the national literati. (Mr. Wu's mailing address is No. 4, Danggong Lane, Nanjing.) I am even more interested in his poems. Especially the first poem, "That fish is so eager to eat, it doesn't care about the hook." I want to draw a picture with this poem as the title. (May 31, 1948, in Hangzhou.)

63 Talking about Lin Zexu by Lu Danlin

Lin Zexu's greatest political achievement in his life was banning opium. He once emphasized: "If opium is not banned, the country will become poorer day by day, and the people will become weaker day by day. After decades, not only will there be no money to raise, but there will be no soldiers to use." Opium has poisoned our country for more than a hundred years, and it has not been completely eliminated to this day. Holding an antidotal ceremony every June 3rd is the most shameful and heartbreaking thing.

Lin strictly banned opium in Hubei and Hunan, which had great results. From January to June in the eighteenth year of Daoguang, Hubei confiscated more than 1,260 opium pipes, and Hunan confiscated more than 2,300 opium pipes. The amount of opium was countless. In the nineteenth year, Lin served as the Governor-General of Liangguang, and his efforts to ban opium became even greater. As a result, the British consul in Guangzhou, Yilu, handed over more than 2.4 million catties of opium (more than 19,000 boxes), which is a very alarming number.

Burning this large batch of opium was indeed a bit troublesome, but Lin studied that opium, lime or brine are the greatest enemies. So on the beach of Humen, he ordered workers to dig countless square pools, paved with stone at the bottom, each pool about fifteen feet in length and width, with culverts in the front and water ditches in the back, and the water from the beach flowed into the pool through the water ditches, and salt was sprinkled to form brine. Each piece of opium was cut into four pieces and put into the pool, soaked for more than ten hours. Then a large amount of whole pieces of lime were thrown down, and the lime immediately became boiling soup when it met water, with a "pop" sound. The workers used iron rakes to circulate and stir. In this way, the fine particles could be completely melted and turned into gray water. When the tide rose, the gates of the culverts were lifted, and the opium juice in each pool flowed out to sea with the waves. This is Lin's detoxification technology, which is different from the current detoxification method.

Lin's ban on opium was originally an achievement that benefited the country and the people, but who knew that it would lead to unfortunate results and be exiled to Yili. The reversal of the Manchu Qing politics is evident. One day, Lin saw his anti-opium comrade Deng Tingzhen released from his demotion in the desolate borderland. Filled with emotions, he wrote three seven-character quatrains to send Deng back to the east, which said:

Getting out of the tent is like getting out of the siege, and a whip first hits the public back. White heads come here to share joys and sorrows, and Qing history fears who will determine right and wrong?

Looking back at the vast sea, we share tears, thunder and dew are always kind to you. The soul calls Jingwei, ever forgetful of death, and the sick Vimalakirti declares survival here.

There are more forks in the road, and there are only feelings. It is speechless to send off guests among guests. Yutang should be a place to hover, not only to return alive and enter the Jade Gate.

The words are gentle and sad, and Lin's feelings and pain can be imagined.

Buying Cheap Books by Xu Guangjue

When I was in school, I made a wish: to buy an average of one book a day, and I did it for a long time; at that time, this was not too difficult, but now I think it has become an unattainable enjoyment. Most of the college students today do not have this "blessing." It is common for me not to buy a book for a month, and to be honest, I really can't afford it.

When the advertisement for Commercial Press's cheap book campaign came out, I was tempted. I believed that it was really cheap, and there were many good books. Although Commercial Press was just using cold goods to exchange for some familiar "heads," if it really wanted to serve the people who read books, the price of new books should at least not be calculated based on the allotted paper, and there should be more new books. But being able to benefit oneself a little and benefit others a little in this way is also a good thing.

At first, I was afraid that there would be too many people and I couldn't squeeze through. My friend laughed at me, saying that there might not be so many people who were really interested in buying books. When I went today, I saw that there were indeed not as many people as I had thought at first, but there were not a few people who were disappointing. Every part was crowded with people, but it didn't seem like it was impossible to squeeze through.

Although everyone is looking down on books, and people who have read a little are also complaining and sighing, the fact is that complaints are complaints, books are innocent, and we should still read some more in the end.

To teach illiterate people to read, and to give literate people more books to read, although it is pedantic, the country can only get better and stronger from this road. I hope that my little article can make Commercial Press sell a few more cheap books, and it can also add a few more readers.

Green by Xin Wo

I went to Taqing, Kunshan, entered the park, climbed Ma'an Mountain (ie, Kunshan), occupied Wenbi Peak, relied on the stone railing, looked down at the wild colors, but saw that the fields were crisscrossed, the green grass was like weaving, and the onion was lush. And between the small bridges and flowing water, there are small boats swaying by from time to time, although it is not as Yang Taichuan said that the scenery is not different, and the mountains and rivers are different when you look up, but after climbing, there is also a feeling of vastness that cannot be exhausted. It was the third month of Jiangnan at that time. Although there were miscellaneous flowers and trees, the vegetation had already grown, so I thought of Wang Jinggong's sentence "The spring breeze turns green on the southern bank of the Yangtze River again", which is not a true portrayal of this time. His poem said: "Between Jingkou and Guazhou is a river, Zhongshan is only separated by thousands of mountains. The spring breeze turns green on the southern bank of the Yangtze River again, when will the bright moon shine on my return?" Using the word "green" as a verb can achieve the wonderful effect of "dotting the eyes". According to Hong Mai's "Rong Zhai Sequel", "The scholar's family in Wuzhong hides his draft. At first, he said 'Again to the southern bank of the Yangtze River', circled out the word 'to', focused on 'not good', changed it to 'pass', then circled it out again and changed it to 'enter', and then changed it to 'full'. After ten or so words, he finally settled on 'green'." This can really be said to be "whining a word properly, cutting off the roots". The difficulty of the poet's deliberation is like this, and those who do not understand cannot realize it. And the value of the manuscripts of famous artists can also be seen here.

Here, I also remembered Mrs. Wu Hufan of Wuxian, Pan Jingshu's Qianqiu Jin's words, "Green is all over the pond grass", which is her proudest sentence in her life. Mr. Hufan once engraved this sentence on stationery as a souvenir, and gave it to friends. It is also a wonderful product of Meiying Shuwu. I once got two copies, and I still treasure them and dare not use them lightly. This stationery was made in the summer of Ji Mao. At the end of this year, there was also a compilation of rake albums (the book was also titled "Green is All Over the Pond Grass"), soliciting celebrities from near and far, nearly a hundred people, either painting or writing inscriptions. For a time, Confucian elders and famous figures in the literary world were almost all over the place, such as Chen Jian'an, He Ting, Xu Zhai, Zhang Jusheng, Zhao Shuju, Yang Yishi, and Xin Shi... all responded with masterpieces. Mr. Hufan also has a rhyming preface, the writing is exquisite and elegant, and the sorrow and condolences for the dead are no less than those of Pan Yue of the Western

### Bloodshed in Hai'ning Yuanba Guandi Temple Area, Farmers Fall to the Ground

Local Authorities Intensify Investigation of the Perpetrators

[Our Newspaper, Hai'ning, May 31st Dispatch] At about 10 p.m. on the 30th, a bloody tragedy occurred in Yuanba Township of this county, with a total of twelve farmers injured. Six of them were wearing uniforms and spoke with a Hunan accent. They got lost and forced a farmer named Pan Yongkang to lead the way to Haichao, claiming to be there to arrest smugglers of illicit salt. Although Pan agreed to guide them, he was reluctant. On the way, they passed the Guandi Temple in the township, where a religious opera was being performed. Pan dodged into the crowd, but he was spotted by the men in uniforms. Without asking what was going on, they opened fire into the crowd. Pan and another rural woman, Yao Aoe, immediately fell to the ground bleeding. A riot broke out. Ten other farmers (including five women) were also wounded by gunfire. The perpetrators fled. Upon receiving the report, the Township Office immediately dispatched police and the Self-Defense Force to pursue them and sent the twelve injured people to the hospital. The perpetrators have already escaped. The local authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation.
