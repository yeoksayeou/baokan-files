### Bai Chongxi Summoned to Nanjing to Consult with the President on Bandit Suppression Strategy in Central China

[Our Hankou Correspondent, 26th] Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi flew to Nanjing this morning for official business, accompanied by Deputy Chief of Staff Zhao Yuan and others.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 26th] General Bai Chongxi, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Central China, was summoned by the President and arrived in Nanjing by special plane at noon around 12:00 PM. After disembarking, Bai drove directly to the official residence on Huangpu Road to meet with the President, report on the current situation of bandit suppression in Central China, and seek instructions from the President. The meeting lasted for over forty minutes. After respectfully listening to the President's instructions, Bai left around 1:00 PM and returned to his private residence in Yongyuan, Dabeixiang, to rest. Bai's trip to Nanjing was decided this morning, and it was kept confidential beforehand, so few people knew of his arrival, and his friends were unable to welcome him at the airport. Around 4:00 PM, Gu Zhutong visited Bai, and at 5:00 PM, Minister He Yingqin also paid a visit, engaging in a long conversation for about an hour. At 8:00 PM in the evening, Qin Decun, Liu Shiyi, Wan Yaohuang, and others visited. Bai is expected to stay for several days.

### Situation in Northeast China Becoming Increasingly Clear; Overall War Program to be Implemented Next Month; Shenyang City Government Thoroughly Eliminates Corruption and Implements Collective Responsibility

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 26th] The situation in Northeast China has become increasingly clear in the past week. In military terms, the favorable development of the Liaonan war situation has increased the confidence of some people in the national army, and the accuracy of the soldiers' shooting has become a legendary tale here. This is the result of Commander Wei's training of soldiers in shooting over the past few months. The reception work in Liaoyang and other places has made significant progress compared to the past, with all materials properly stored and protected. The strict military discipline of the national army has provided great comfort to the people after the disaster. Gao Xibing, Deputy Director of the Political Committee, has announced that the provinces and cities in Northeast China will implement the Overall War Program on August 1st. Under the current relatively well-off situation in Northeast China, this news has greatly excited both the government and the people. The spirit of the Overall War Program is mostly based on the Hebei-Chahar-Suiyuan plan, but the methods are slightly different due to different circumstances. The program is divided into four departments: military, political, economic, and cultural. The military focuses on mass organization, that is, the people suppressing bandits for their own survival, promoting self-defense, covering autonomy, and strengthening the awareness of autonomy, so that life and combat, people and the country, become an inseparable whole. Politics focuses on administration going to the countryside, talent going to the countryside, and economy going to the countryside, so that the government and the people cooperate. Economy focuses on land reform, that is, equalizing the burden of the people, so that those who have more pay more, the middle class pays less, and the poor pay nothing. Culture focuses on ideological bandit suppression, so that culture goes to the countryside, enhances the anti-enemy sentiment, enhances the belief in eliminating the Communist bandits, and at the same time fully promotes primary school education. Wang Tiehan, Chairman of Liaoning Province, has returned from inspecting various counties, facing difficulties but being extremely popular. Yesterday, the city government completed the city-wide road repair plan, especially the newly built asphalt roads and sewers in the urban area, which is an innovation. In order to strengthen the grassroots organization, prevent spies, the mayor of the city, Dong, has reversed the previous method of appointing Bao chiefs and adopted an examination system. The 194 Bao chiefs who have passed the examination are now trained and assigned to serve in various Bao. In order to thoroughly eliminate corruption, Mayor Dong implemented a five-person collective responsibility system for the 1,500 employees of the city.

### Chu Xichun Describes Guerrilla Control Surface Tactics at Weekly Meeting

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 26th] Chairman of Hebei Province, Chu Xichun, announced "Guerrilla Control Surface" tactics at the weekly meeting on the 25th. Chu stated that based on the recent experience in the battle of the northern section of the Hebei-Beijing Railway in eastern Hebei, it proves that defending points to control the surface is not as effective as "Guerrilla Control Surface" in striking the enemy. When bandits coordinate with large units for combat, they must not defend to the death, sacrificing a city or a piece of land, without sacrificing people or losing guns and supplies. In the recent battles, Lai Shui, Ding Xing, Xin Cheng, Xiang He, Wu Qing, and other counties were abandoned once due to strategic reasons, but they were all recovered later. Xin Cheng's practice of clearing the fields and houses was the best. If this method can be maintained in the future, the bandits will have no way to seize weapons or loot supplies. Chu continued, stating that there are three basic conditions for implementing guerrilla warfare: (1) Information is unobstructed to judge the enemy's situation and decide whether to retreat or defend. (2) Clearing the fields and houses, so that not only the soldiers retreat, but also the people retreat, a large amount of materials are transported away, a small amount of food and utensils are buried, and the large armies are dismantled and buried separately. The wells are covered to prevent the enemy from having food and drink when entering the city, and from finding supplies, vehicles, or people. (3) Blockading the bandit army, immediately cutting off pedestrians after clearing the fields, preventing the bandits from sending out a scout. Chu concluded that this is a strategic shift, and he hopes that the people will understand and support this tactic.

### Communist Bandit Headquarters Moves to Mount Wutai, Nuns Forced to Leave Temples and Marry

[United Press, Nanjing, 26th] A government military spokesperson told the United Press on the 26th that the Chinese Communist Party has moved its political and military nerve center to Mount Wutai in Shanxi Province, replacing Yan'an, which has served as the Communist Party headquarters for twelve years. The spokesperson said that Communist leaders Mao Zedong and bandit army commander Zhu De are both in Mount Wutai, but they often go to southern Shanxi to guide party affairs and military operations. Mount Wutai is seventy miles from Taiyuan and is one of the four major Buddhist holy sites in the country. Since the Communist Party occupied it, all temples have been converted into training camps, schools, barracks, and dormitories, and all nuns have been forced to return to secular life and marry.

[Our Sian Correspondent, 26th] It is reported that the situation in Taiyuan has stabilized. There are only small battles in the western and southern suburbs. Since the President flew to Taiyuan, the national army troops and air force have arrived in a steady stream. The defense has been strengthened, and people's hearts have been stabilized. A comprehensive counterattack is being planned.

[Our Taiyuan Correspondent, 26th] On the night of the 25th, the Communist bandits attempted to approach the suburbs of the city and fiercely attacked on both sides of the Fen River. In the area north of Xiaodianzhen, east of the river, the bandits attacked the national army positions south of Yangjiabao, ten miles south of the city, continuously and fiercely, but were repelled by the defending troops. At dawn, the national army counterattacked, and the bandits suffered heavy losses and fled back to the villages such as Meijing, west of the river. At the same time, they attacked Dawang Village and fired artillery at Baishagou, but were suppressed by our artillery and retreated in a panic. On the 26th, planes roared all day, coordinating with the ground troops to annihilate the bandits, inflicting heavy losses on them.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th] The national army around Taiyuan again inflicted heavy losses on the attacking bandits. At midnight on the 25th, the bandits attacked our Dawang Village (fifteen miles southwest of the city) and Yangjiabao (fifteen miles south of the city) simultaneously with two brigades. The bandits attacking Dawang Village launched four charges, but were repelled by our army's intense artillery fire. On the morning of the 26th, our land and air forces coordinated to suppress the bandits. The remaining bandits could not withstand the pressure and fled towards Shagou. The more than two thousand bandits who attacked Yangjiabao suffered more than two hundred casualties in the fierce counterattack by the national army. The remaining bandits fled towards Xiaodianzhen (twenty miles south of the city).

[Another Dispatch] On the afternoon of the 25th, the elite troops of the national army launched a suppression campaign against the bandits who had fled to Huangtupo and Xiaoxigou in the mountains north of Yuci. Within an hour, they captured the above two places and three nearby mountain peaks. The bandits fled south.

Hu replied, "Received the letter requesting reinforcements for Taiyuan. I greatly admire your insights. In addition to airlifting reinforcements, I will proceed with the planned operations. I hereby reply."

### Thirteen Bandit Spies Executed in Taiyuan Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th] The Garrison Headquarters executed thirteen bandit spy criminals this afternoon in accordance with the Emergency Penal Regulations for Endangering the State during the Suppression Period. Among them, eight criminals including Zhang Ding, Ding Su'e, Song Wenbing, Hu Ke,周一清, Qiao Yu, and乔有章 sneaked into the city after the Communist bandits disturbed the outskirts of Taiyuan, or wore our army's uniforms, posing as our cadres, or disguised themselves as vendors, secretly engaging in activities, attempting to incite the citizens, and plotting riots. Four criminals, including Wan Chunren, Wen Qing, Li Guangdou, and Qi Fubi, were our cadres who had been captured by bandits and then放回. After receiving tasks from the rebel bandits, they secretly returned, did not report to the competent authority, and secretly engaged in activities, spreading rumors and plotting wrongdoing. Another criminal, Wang Jingting, a member of the Communist bandit party, served in the Northwest Industrial Construction Company, promoting for the bandits and confusing people. All were proved clear after interrogation, and submitted to Director Yan for approval to carry out the death penalty.

### Method of Selecting Supervisory Commissioners for Administrative Offices; Supervisory Yuan Discussed All Day; Final Decision to be Made at Today's Meeting

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 26th] The Supervisory Yuan held its 25th meeting at 9:45 AM on the 26th, chaired by President Yu. First, the Secretariat read the minutes of the previous meeting and Tian Jiongjin's original presentation requesting resignation from the position of Supervisory Commissioner to assume the position of Minister of Examination. Then, the discussion began on the draft method for selecting Supervisory Commissioners for Administrative Offices (the full text of which has been seen in today's newspaper). First, Li Zhengle, Chairman of the Drafting Committee, reported on the drafting process, followed by various members expressing their opinions. This discussion had no concrete results until 11:00 AM. Finally, Chen Darong, Gao Dengting, and others separately proposed two temporary motions. Chen Darong's motion was: "It is proposed to organize inspection groups in advance to go to various provinces for inspection in order to strengthen the effectiveness of supervision." Gao Dengting's motion was: "The organization of administrative offices in various districts should wait until the regulations are revised." The presentation of these two cases was because some people believed that the administrative office organization regulations passed by the Legislative Yuan were greatly different from the draft proposed by the Supervisory Yuan, among which the avoidance of native origin was the most important. They unanimously believed that if the principle of avoiding native origin must be followed, there would be no one familiar with the local situation, and the exercise of power would be greatly hindered. Under the circumstances of dissatisfaction with these organizational regulations, there was a proposal to postpone the establishment of administrative offices. At the same time, this opinion was sent to the President, requesting the Legislative Yuan to reconsider. During the reconsideration period, inspection groups should be organized first to exercise power. However, during the discussion, some people also believed that the Supervisory Yuan should comply with the laws and regulations and form administrative offices in accordance with the organizational regulations passed by the Legislative Yuan. If obstacles occur after implementation, they should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration and revision. This discussion was submitted to a vote this morning and has been decided to be discussed finally at the 26th meeting on the 27th. According to today's discussion, there were still a majority of people who believed that it was really inappropriate to list the Mongolian Administrative Office in the organizational regulations, and their speeches were fierce. Secondly, some people advocated that administrative offices and inspection groups should be organized and established at the same time. In short, general opinions are very important to the organization of administrative offices, because they are the basic conditions for the exercise of supervisory power.

### Coal and Flower Management Committee and Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office to be Abolished by Order of the Executive Yuan

### Zhang Qun Tours Famous Scenic Spots in Yunnan

Li Genyuan Unable to Go to Kunming Due to Road Obstructions

### Sun Du Has Been Ill and Has Not Yet Taken Office; Rehe Provincial Politics Unattended; Supervisory Commissioner Submits a Corrective Case Requesting the Reassignment of Cadres to Preside

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 26th] The newly appointed Chairman of Rehe Province, Sun Du, came to Ping from Jin on the 24th and immediately fell ill (reportedly a stroke). He will not be able to go to Chengde to take office in the short term.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 26th] The situation in Rehe Province is still at a critical stage. Chairman Sun Du has not yet taken office more than a month after being appointed, and provincial politics are unattended, almost becoming a vacuum. People in Rehe Province have recently sent letters to the Supervisory Commissioners here, asking them to appeal on their behalf. Supervisory Commissioner卢凤阁 has submitted a corrective case to the Supervisory Yuan, "Requesting the government to quickly reassign cadres to preside over Rehe provincial politics, to save the current crisis, to protect the key area of national defense, and to comfort the feelings of the people." The reasons for this are: The government announced Sun Du as the Chairman of Rehe Province on June 22nd, but he has not taken office for more than a month, and the former Chairman, Fan Hanjie, is fully engaged in military affairs and no longer cares about the provincial government, resulting in the stagnation of provincial politics and the anxiety of the people, which not only affects the morale of the people, but also makes the overall situation in North China insecure. This is one reason. Rehe Province is an important place for national defense, and its gains and losses are of great importance to the safety of the Northeast and North China. Now, the situation in Chengde is isolated, and there is a shortage of food, which originally relied on airlift. The stability of people's hearts depends entirely on the immediate presence of the presiding officer. Now, Sun Du has not taken office for more than a month after being appointed. According to the regulations of the Civil Service Service Law, he should take office within one month after receiving the appointment letter. Now Sun is overdue and has not arrived, and he has failed in his responsibility. The government should re-select cadres to serve as the chairman of Rehe, in order to stabilize the people's hearts. The case will be brought up for discussion in advance at the meeting on the 27th.

### The Kuomintang's Party Affairs Review Conference to Convene in Early August in Nanjing; Innovation Issues to Await Full Congress Decision

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The Kuomintang Central Committee department heads held their second meeting at 10:00 AM on the 26th to discuss party reform issues. Chairman Wu Tiecheng presided. First, Hong Lanyou presented the opinions drafted by a subcommittee regarding improvements to party affairs for discussion and decision. Attendees spoke enthusiastically, with most expressing opinions on the lack of coordination between the party and the government. No concrete conclusions were reached on the principles proposed by Hong. It is reported that this meeting of department heads is scheduled to reconvene on the 28th. The party reform plan will be drafted only after the results of the department heads' meeting are discussed, then submitted to the President for review, and then submitted to the upcoming party affairs review conference for discussion. It is said that Hong's opinions, presented at today's meeting, are divided into twelve items, none of which are decisive. The general principles are divided into sections such as organization, policy, discipline, and activities. Regarding the organization section, the question is whether it should be streamlined or expanded, whether it should be generated by elections or remain top-down, and whether personnel should be changed. Regarding the policy section, major issues such as foreign policy will not be changed. During the discussion, some people raised the issue of the coordination between party members in the government and the party. In the future, it is essential to achieve coordination and implement the party's decisions. Regarding discipline, the question is how to ensure that party members abide by party discipline and how to coordinate the party and the government, and the party and its affiliated organizations. Other issues include the organization of party members and the organization of the central party headquarters.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The convening of the Kuomintang Party Affairs Review Conference was decided at the Central Committee Department Heads Meeting on the 26th. (1) The location is Nanjing. (2) The time is early next month (originally scheduled for the 29th, but it is likely too late because the reform plan is not yet complete). (3) Attendees will include standing members of the Central Committee in Nanjing, heads of central departments and commissions, and Kuomintang members of the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan. The review will likely involve a broad discussion. It is also learned that, in addition to discussing the party reform plan, the review will also address the overall war plan and the party-affiliated organizations unification plan. The conference will seek to achieve a concrete reform plan as an important guideline for future party affairs.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] The Kuomintang's Party Affairs Review Conference will decide on the most significant issues of innovation in party affairs. The Kuomintang Central Committee has also decided to submit the concrete reform plan it achieves at the review conference to the Party's Seventh Plenary Session or the National Congress for final decision. President Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet at his official residence on the 26th for Kuomintang party members in the government and heads of central organs and ministries. He solemnly pointed out that the current innovation movement is the party's last chance, with success as the only option. He hoped that everyone would discuss reform ideas in advance outside the meeting. Wu Tiecheng then gave a speech, after which the meeting adjourned.

Editorial

### Rural Revival and Agricultural Improvement

Recently, the government authorities have paid close attention to the agricultural issue. The Ministry of Land Affairs is actively focusing its efforts on the research and planning of comprehensive land reform, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is paying attention to the implementation of agricultural extension, and plans to take 25 counties in Zhejiang as demonstration areas to carry out modernized agricultural extension guidance. In recent forums, attention to the issue of agricultural science has surpassed the technical issues of land reform. This is a progressive phenomenon, and it is unanimously believed that the key to the agricultural issue does not lie entirely in land reform and land distribution, but rather in agricultural improvement, increased efficiency, and increased production, so that farmers are completely free from hunger and poverty, and completely obtain a reasonable standard of living. This kind of rationalized and standardized agricultural economy, we can call it an agricultural economy where the people are not hungry or cold, which is also the Xiaokang economy first pursued by the Principle of People's Livelihood.

China is an agricultural economic society, and the "peace" and "chaos" of the country almost entirely depend on whether agricultural production can be fully developed and whether farmers' lives can be peaceful and prosperous. As for making agricultural production develop, it not only requires equal land distribution, but also requires increased efficiency and increased production to make up for the insufficiency of land ownership distribution; to make farmers' lives peaceful and prosperous, it not only requires the elimination of natural disasters such as floods and droughts and the avoidance of conscription of soldiers and grain, but also requires a permanently stable and peaceful environment. Some people think that solving the land distribution problem is the same as solving the farmers' problem. This theory is unsound and not a healthy agricultural economy. This is a superficial view that only sees the mountain and not the forest. From a modern economic point of view, this theory is already outdated.

Now, let's look at the current situation of the land problem in China to see where the real key to the agricultural problem lies. According to reliable estimates, although China is known as a vast country with abundant resources, the area of cultivated land is still very small, only about 1.3 billion mu, accounting for about 10% of the total land area; if this cultivated land area is distributed among more than 320 million farmers, each person will get only 3.75 mu (about 0.6 acres), which is very different from the 2.5 acres estimated by Professor East of the United States as the minimum requirement for maintaining life. In addition, natural disasters and man-made disasters have been frequent in recent years, and much of the cultivated land has been abandoned, and the stagnation of farmland in the Yellow River flood area is one example. In terms of the ratio of land to population, it is obvious that there are more people than land, and the statistics clearly point out this "unequal" phenomenon. According to the statistics in 1927, poor and middle peasants with less than 30 mu accounted for 79% of the total population, while the proportion of total cultivated land area they occupied was only 19%; middle peasants with 30 to 50 mu accounted for 16% of the total population, and the proportion of cultivated land area they occupied was 17%; landlords with more than 50 mu accounted for only 15% of the total population, and the proportion of total cultivated land area they occupied was as high as 62%. According to the survey conducted by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute in 1937, self-cultivating farmers accounted for 4%, semi-self-cultivating farmers accounted for 24%, and tenant farmers accounted for 30%. As a result of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, many self-cultivating farmers have fallen into semi-self-cultivating farmers or tenant farmers, making the ownership of land more concentrated. Naturally, this "unequal" phenomenon must be resolved by distribution. Regarding land distribution, the Principle of People's Livelihood has long established the solution of "equalization of land rights" to achieve the goal of "land to the tiller". Unfortunately, the government has failed to promote land reform in the past, or the implementation has not been thorough enough, and there has been little effect. For example, in the past, confirming the land measurement was regarded as the beginning of reforming the land problem, but land measurement was only held in a very small number of counties; another example is the promotion of "25% rent reduction" as a step to support self-cultivating farmers, but "25% rent reduction" has not been universally implemented to this day. Recently, farmers in Hunan demanded "25% rent reduction" and were killed as a result. It can be seen that the solution to the land distribution problem still faces many obstacles today. Since the government is currently feeling the seriousness of the Communist Party problem, it should make a painful decision and quickly implement the land reform policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood. On the other hand, it should also cooperate with the improvement and progress of the agricultural economy, and seek the development of agricultural production and the prosperity of the rural economy from the land utilization problem.

The utilization of land is also the problem of agricultural production and management. The development of modern agricultural production has been widely mechanized and scientificized around the world. In terms of production technology, collective cultivation is adopted, and in terms of agricultural management, large-scale farms are adopted. The phenomenon of fragmentation and dispersion of land in China can gradually move towards large-scale farms in management. This newspaper published a communication from Bengbu on July 23, detailing the trial of agricultural mechanization and agricultural science in northeastern Anhui (including the three counties of Wuhe, Xiangyuan, and Shicheng). Not only did it use tractors to cultivate fields from a technical point of view, with remarkable results, which were admired by farmers everywhere, but it also achieved unexpected success in management. Production increased, farmers were united, and the achievement of a well-off life for farmers' families was entirely entrusted to the guidance of agricultural science and management. The relationship between farmers and the government is interdependent. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry recently plans to cooperate with the United Nations and the Zhejiang Provincial Government to carry out modernized agricultural extension in 25 counties, including Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Jinhua. This is an excellent area to promote collective cultivation and experiment with large-scale farms. Taking the experience of the trial of agricultural mechanization in northeastern Anhui as an example, if the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry tries this system in the 25 counties of Zhejiang, the people of Zhejiang will certainly respond with warm welcome. It is hoped that the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will implement this huge plan as soon as possible!

In short, the agricultural problem is the most pressing and urgent problem among the socio-economic problems in China today. Only through agricultural improvement, increased efficiency, increased production, and expanded land utilization can more than 320 million farmers be freed from hunger and poverty and completely obtain a reasonable life. We support the improvement and progress of the agricultural economy, and the cooperation between China and other countries, so that agricultural production can be fully developed. We look forward to the daily progress of agricultural mechanization in northeastern Anhui, and we especially hope that the collective operation of large-scale farms in Zhejiang can be realized as soon as possible!

Underground Banks Scramble for Goods

Opium Dealers Buy Machinery and Bullets in Exchange for Opium

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 26th Dispatch] In recent weeks, price fluctuations in Ya'an, Western Sichuan, have been severe, with average prices rising by 80%. Clear oil costs 500,000 per jin, and rice costs 4.8 million per dou. The local government has not regulated dozens of underground banks, so a large amount of floating capital is being absorbed to scramble for goods. However, because Ya'an has limited resources, deposits are being transferred to Chengdu and Chongqing, estimated at about 300 billion. In addition, newly harvested opium has been put on the market in Tianquan, Lushan, Baoxing, Maogong and other places, and opium dealers are using grain, machinery and bullets to trade for opium. The supply of rice in Ya'an relies on the supply from Mingshan and other places, but more than 10,000 shi of grain were destroyed by fire in Mingshan, so under the circumstances that various opium dealers are snapping up and exchanging opium, rice is even more scarce, which has a great impact on public security.

### 杜魯門將要求國會有限制管制物資　外交問題可能提出討論　　〔合眾社華盛頓廿六日電〕
Truman will request Congress to limit control of supplies; diplomatic issues may be raised for discussion [United Press Washington, 26th]

共和黨控制之八十屆議會，將於今日中午（上海節約時間廿七日上午二時）復會，準備拒絕杜魯門總統關於肉類分配及有限制管制物價等之緊急請求。
The 80th Congress, controlled by the Republican Party, will reconvene at noon today (Shanghai savings time 2 a.m. on the 27th) and prepare to reject President Truman's emergency requests regarding meat allocation and limited price controls.

但共和黨對目前之通貨膨脹以及高物價對總統競選之嚴重威脅，亦深感焦慮。
However, the Republican Party is also deeply concerned about the current inflation and the serious threat of high prices to the presidential campaign.

倘杜魯門對渠所應爲者有若干其他意見，共和黨可能加以支持。
The Republican Party may support Truman if he has some other opinions about what he should do.

雖然，杜魯門總統之召開國會緊急會議，僅係考慮國內問題，但外交問題可能亦係因素之一，如柏林局勢愈趨尖銳，則國會無疑將討論外交政策。
Although President Truman called the emergency session of Congress only to consider domestic issues, foreign affairs may also be a factor, as Congress will undoubtedly discuss foreign policy if the situation in Berlin becomes more acute.

杜威的智囊團  章礝石譯
Dewey's Brain Trust Translated by Zhang Yunshi

　　　假如在本年十一月的總統選舉中，杜威和華倫果眞是獲得了勝利，那末，到一九四九年一月二十日，杜成和華倫就可以正式做白宮的正副主人了。
If Dewey and Warren were to win the presidential election this November, then on January 20, 1949, Dewey and Warren could officially become the master and deputy master of the White House.

政府的組織，也將隨之一新。
The organization of the government will also be renewed accordingly.

白宮裏，從之就將移入一羣新的部長，新的秘書，新的顧問和新的智囊團。
A group of new ministers, new secretaries, new advisors, and new brain trusts will move into the White House.

其他的官員，也將另有一種新的政見。
Other officials will also have a new kind of political view.

　　當一個握了十六年政權的政黨落選之後，由另一個政黨去而代之，自然不論是執政的人物和政府的態度，都將煥然一新。
When a party that has held power for sixteen years loses an election and is replaced by another party, naturally, both the ruling figures and the government's attitude will be completely renewed.

如果杜威眞是如願以償當選了下屆的總統，我們可以從他的競選綱領中，和以往的記錄裏，推敲出他就任後的政策。
If Dewey truly achieves his wish and is elected as the next president, we can deduce his policies after taking office from his campaign platform and past record.

　　杜咸當選了總統之後，白宮裏的顧問，大部分將自三四十位人中挑選出來。
After Durham is elected president, most of the advisors in the White House will be selected from thirty to forty people.

這所謂的三四十位人物，乃是興他在紐約的時候，接觸最親密者。
These so-called thirty to forty people are those who had the closest contact with him when he was in New York.

其中，有幾位可能被挑選組閣，另外的幾位，則祖任一些比較不顯著的事。
Among them, some may be selected to form a cabinet, while others will assume some less prominent positions.

但是這些人能成爲杜威政權中的智囊團，却是在意測中的。
However, it is expected that these people will become the brain trust in Dewey's regime.

　　關於政治方面的人才，就得提起杜威智囊團中的勃朗尼。
Regarding political talents, we must mention Brownell in Dewey's brain trust.

他今年考四十四歲，是杜威的法萊“Jim　Farley”。
He is forty-four years old this year and is Dewey's Farley "Jim Farley".

勃朗尼先生也許是共和黨國民委員會的主席，如果共和黨競選獲勝，可能被任命爲杜威政權下的政治人物。
Mr. Brownell may be the chairman of the Republican National Committee. If the Republican Party wins the election, he may be appointed as a political figure under the Dewey regime.

做郵務總長，他是很有可能的。
He is very likely to become the Postmaster General.

自然，當杜咸組閣時，他無疑地是强有力的台柱之一。
Naturally, when Durham forms a cabinet, he is undoubtedly one of the strong pillars.

　　勃朗尼是紙約州的政治老手，他與羅斯福政權的「法萊」略有不同。
Brownell is a political veteran in New York State, and he is slightly different from Roosevelt's "Farley."

他是尼勃拉斯加大學出身，所以他是配得上做一般政務的顧問。
He is a graduate of the University of Nebraska, so he is worthy of being an advisor for general political affairs.

　　其他可與勃朗尼共事者，計有史勃拉格和賈克爾二位。
Others who can work with Brownell include Sprague and Jackel.

史勃拉格是紐約的共和黨國民委員會委員，賈克爾是以前紐約州的共和黨主席。
Sprague is a member of the Republican National Committee of New York, and Jackel is the former Republican chairman of New York State.

這三位先生，將在杜威當選之後，負起艱巨的任務。
These three gentlemen will assume arduous tasks after Dewey is elected.

　　關於外交人才我們就得提起杜爾斯。
Regarding diplomatic talents, we must mention Dulles.

他今年六十歲，如果杜威當選，他可能就是杜咸政權下的顯著人物之一。
He is sixty years old this year. If Dewey is elected, he may be one of the prominent figures under the Durham regime.

杜爾斯先生是紐約的律師，假使他願意從事的話，他是很配做國務卿的。
Mr. Dulles is a lawyer in New York. If he is willing to engage in it, he is very suitable to be the Secretary of State.

雖然他的政見與馬歇爾有些出入，但是大體上是不會有所改變的。
Although his political views are somewhat different from Marshall's, they will not change much in general.

　　提起了杜爾斯，我們又不得不記憶起過去的國際重要會議，和國聯的事，那時，他也是主事人的一個。
Speaking of Dulles, we cannot help but recall the important international conferences of the past and the affairs of the League of Nations, when he was also one of the main persons in charge.

憑他幾年來的個人經驗，他足够可以與史達林或莫洛托夫折衝樽俎。
With his personal experience over the years, he is fully capable of negotiating with Stalin or Molotov.

他可說共和黨外交代表人物中的最重要者。
He can be said to be the most important figure among the Republican diplomatic representatives.

雖然在這幾年中，他是杜威的顧問之一，但是他與國務院和范登堡却保持着密切的關係。
Although he has been one of Dewey's advisors in recent years, he has maintained close relations with the State Department and Vandenberg.

如果杜威獲到勝利，杜爾斯—范登堡這一組，便會管制美國與其他各國的關
If Dewey wins, the Dulles-Vandenberg group will control the relationship between the United States and other countries.

　　關於國內政治的人才，四十五歲的培爾就是在杜威智囊團中最適當的人物之一。
Regarding domestic political talents, 45-year-old Beale is one of the most suitable figures in Dewey's brain trust.

他是從前「紐約時報」的財政問題執筆者之一。
He was formerly one of the writers on financial issues for "The New York Times".

他也是杜咸州長幾年來心目中的「理想人物」。
He has also been the "ideal figure" in the mind of Governor Durham for several years.

他是供給杜威演說資料的人物，他是杜成的顧問，常常跟隨着杜威的。
He is the person who supplies Dewey with speech materials. He is Dewey's advisor and often accompanies Dewey.

　　培爾先生，現在是紐約州銀行界的指揮者，假如他願意去幹的話，當杜咸當選總統之後，可能由他出任財政部長。
Mr. Beale is now the commander of the banking industry in New York State. If he is willing to do it, he may be appointed as the Secretary of the Treasury after Durham is elected president.

他的政見，不論是對於經濟或財政，與他接觸過的銀行家和經濟學家，無不讚成的。
His political views, whether on economics or finance, are approved by the bankers and economists he has contacted.

如果培爾先生不高興担任財長，那末在杜威任內，財政部長可能由傑出的銀行家去担任。
If Mr. Beale is not happy to serve as the Secretary of the Treasury, then during Dewey's tenure, the Secretary of the Treasury may be served by an outstanding banker.

像契斯國民銀行的董事長亞爾屈里區就是很有希望的一個。
Like Alcuri, the chairman of Chase National Bank, is a very promising one.

　　在國曾中，杜威政權也極需要相當的人才。
In Congress, the Dewey regime also desperately needs considerable talent.

這是用以保持國會與白宮關係的。
This is to maintain the relationship between Congress and the White House.

華倫，他正和杜威一樣，是新到華盛頓的人物，所以不甚適當。
Warren, like Dewey, is a newcomer to Washington, so he is not very suitable.

伊凡斯是紐約籍的上院議員，今年五十二歲，他可能會担任這項艱巨的工作的。
Evans is a senator from New York, 52 years old this year, and he may take on this difficult job.

因爲他與杜咸是特別接近，他也可能被任命爲勞工部長。
Because he is particularly close to Durham, he may also be appointed as the Secretary of Labor.

但是看上去，他又是很可能留着在參議院裏任駐國會的白宮發言人的。
But it seems that he is also very likely to stay in the Senate as the White House spokesperson to Congress.

當新政權成立之後，他的新職位也很可能爲貝尼斯所佔，但是杜威下面的人物，却都希望這職位應由伊凡期去担任。（上）
After the new regime is established, his new position is also very likely to be occupied by Benes, but the figures under Dewey all hope that this position should be held by Evans. (Above)

各大公用事業公司報告經濟困難詳情　各機關代表今舉行會議　　〔本報訊〕
Major public utility companies report details of economic difficulties Representatives of various agencies hold a meeting today [Report from this newspaper]

本市各大公用事業公司，因物價不斷高漲，所用煤斤，燃料，五金，外匯，以及依照生活指數所發職工薪津等，均直綫上漲，雖按月調整價格，仍感困難，甚至瀕於無法維持之境，各公司負責人曾於上週聯袂晋謁吳市長，懇商解決辦法，吳市長當囑各公司將實際虧損情形，造具書面報吿表，送呈市府俾便提出會議討論。
Due to the continuous rise in prices, the major public utility companies in this city have experienced a straight-line increase in the cost of coal, fuel, hardware, foreign exchange, and employee salaries issued according to the cost of living index.

輪船裝卸工底薪仲裁加百分七五　　〔本報訊〕
Arbitration increases the basic salary of stevedores by 75 percent [Report from this newspaper]

輪船艙口裝卸工人，此次要求提高底薪。
This time, the stevedores requested an increase in their basic salary.

該項工人之底薪原爲二角四分一噸，照指數計算。
The basic salary of these workers was originally two jiao and four fen per ton, calculated according to the index.

各公司認爲旣以指數計算，况指數又逐漸增高，底薪即不能再增加。
The companies believe that since it is calculated based on the index, and the index is gradually increasing, the basic salary cannot be increased again.

後輪公會與裝缷工會商討，亦無結果，雙方遂申請社會局仲裁。
Later, the Shipping Guild and the Stevedores Union discussed it, but there was no result. Both parties then applied to the Social Affairs Bureau for arbitration.

昨社會局召集雙方代表會議，經仲裁結果，由二角四分基數，增加百分之七十五，計四角二分，按照指數結算，此項爭執乃吿解決。
Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting of representatives from both parties. After arbitration, it was decided to increase the base of two jiao and four fen by 75%, which is four jiao and two fen, and settle according to the index. This dispute was resolved.

直接稅局員工並未發生餓工　　〔本報訊〕

Previously, all employees of the Direct Taxation Bureau had requested the authorities to increase their salaries to be equal to those of the Customs, and requested the Bureau to temporarily issue three dan of rice before receiving central approval, and then borrow salaries 500,000 times the basic salary per person to maintain their livelihood. The Bureau agreed to forward the request to the Ministry of Finance for approval. It was rumored that all employees expressed dissatisfaction with this and had a hunger strike. Yesterday, according to Ge Yanshao, an assistant at the Bureau, this did not happen, and he said that all work in the Bureau was proceeding as usual.

全市銀樓恢復飾金買賣　昨起開始掛牌　條塊仍然禁售　　〔本報訊〕
Gold shops throughout the city resume the trading of gold ornaments Starting yesterday, prices are posted, but gold bars are still prohibited from being sold [Report from this newspaper]

全市大小同行銀樓業百餘家，於昨日起開始飾金掛牌，恢復買賣。
More than 100 gold shops of all sizes in the city started posting prices for gold ornaments yesterday and resumed trading.

每兩兌出價爲三億六千萬元，收進價爲三億二千萬元。
The price for selling out is 360 million yuan per tael, and the price for buying in is 320 million yuan per tael.

按恢復買賣飾金問題，前經市參議會提出，市政會議通過，准先行復業，再由市府向財部備案。
Regarding the issue of resuming the trading of gold ornaments, it was previously proposed by the Municipal Council, passed by the Municipal Council meeting, and approved for resumption of business first, and then the Municipal Government will file it with the Ministry of Finance.

金價計算辦法，係由市政會議決定，依照中央銀行掛牌金價，及美鈔結匯證明書，另加營業費用百分之四十，合法利潤百分之二十，至手工費則視飾物精細程度而定，但最多不得超過金價百分之一百。
The method of calculating the gold price is determined by the Municipal Council meeting, according to the listed gold price of the Central Bank and the exchange settlement certificate of US dollars, plus 40% of operating expenses and 20% of legal profit. The labor cost depends on the fineness of the ornaments, but it must not exceed 100% of the gold price.

該業同業公會，昨日依據上項方式計算後，送請社會局審核，今後牌價上落，由該業公會依據國行結匯證明書牌價自動調整。
After calculating according to the above method yesterday, the industry association submitted it to the Social Affairs Bureau for review. In the future, the price fluctuations will be automatically adjusted by the industry association based on the exchange settlement certificate price of the National Bank.

昨據社局吳局長談稱：銀樓今後祗准飾金買賣，至條塊仍在禁售之列。
According to Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, gold shops are only allowed to trade gold ornaments in the future, and gold bars are still prohibited from being sold.

　　又悉各銀樓業奉公會通知後，營業態度均甚謹愼，量入爲出。
It is also learned that after receiving the notification from the association, the gold shops are all very cautious in their business practices and live within their means.

至舊金兌換首飾金，所收貼水爲每兩一百二十萬元，較以前之貼水額提高一倍。
The premium charged for exchanging old gold for jewelry gold is 1.2 million yuan per tael, which is double the previous premium amount.

Free Talk "Treating the Headache by Treating the Foot" by Wu Yong

The authorities are constantly trying to address the economic crisis with both short-term and long-term solutions, but ultimately resort to issuing large denomination banknotes. Certain commentators then deliberately engage in deceptive rhetoric, asking how much ten yuan of pre-war legal tender was worth, and how much one hundred thousand yuan of today's legal tender is worth. To cope with reality, banknotes with a face value of five million yuan are still not flexible enough to fulfill the task of currency. Banknotes with even greater face value than the twenty-five hundred thousand yuan Customs Gold Unit are urgently needed. They further emphasize that the issuance of large denomination banknotes should not affect prices, and the fact that it inevitably affects prices is due to psychological misperceptions among the general public.

Little do they know that whether or not large denomination banknotes stimulate prices is not a matter of "should" or "should not," but purely a matter of fact. Based on past facts, has there ever been a time when the issuance of large denomination banknotes did not cause prices to soar? As for "psychological misperceptions," even if it is a "misperception," if the majority of society holds this "psychological misperception," we must pay attention to it and consider it carefully. For example, low morale is merely a psychological effect. Can military leaders afford to ignore it? The advocates of issuing banknotes with a face value greater than twenty-five hundred thousand Customs Gold Units are probably free from "psychological misperceptions," but listening to their words, they sound like hoarders.

Those who say such things are only a small minority in society, the so-called wealthy "big shots." For any measure that would stimulate price increases, such as abolishing price controls and issuing large denomination banknotes, these people invariably distort it in advance and use every means to bring it about. Once their goal is achieved and prices rise, we can vaguely hear their joyful and encouraging voices behind the scenes, like pigs eating distiller's grains, drunkenly full and lying down, making grunting noises. When they wake up happy, they put on a show, expressing grand theories and justifying price increases in every way, like watching a fire from across the river, observing the mundane world from a carefree cloud. As soon as prices stabilize slightly, they are the first to get anxious, saying that the price of rice is too low compared to other commodities, and if this continues, it will "harm the farmers with cheap prices," and the world will collapse. In reality, these people only have their own personal interests in mind, but when they speak, they insist on discussing the "should" and "should not" of right and wrong. Lu Xun said, "Beware of those who constantly talk about benevolence, righteousness, and morality." Remarque also said, "Cynics often have noble personalities, while idealists tend to be unreliable." Both are probably referring to this type of person.

Now that the large denomination banknotes have been issued, only a few wealthy "big shots" can cover their mouths and laugh upon hearing the news. But what's done is done, and it is useless to say more. However, one cannot help but hope that the authorities will never again go against the tide, not start by stabilizing prices, but instead issue large denomination banknotes to cater to price increases. In particular, it is not appropriate to issue more empty rhetoric about "addressing both the root and the branch." It must be understood that if everything requires "addressing both the root and the branch," it is probably a terminal illness. People today often criticize the government with the saying "treating the headache by treating the head, treating the foot by treating the foot," and the government often takes this as a warning. In fact, a headache should naturally be treated by treating the head, and a foot pain should naturally be treated by treating the foot. What is to be feared is "treating the headache by treating the foot" and "treating the foot by treating the head."

Jiguge by Qian Dacheng

Jiguge was located at Qixing Bridge, more than ten li outside Yingchun Gate in Changshu. It was the place where Mao Zijin collected and printed books during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Ye Dehui has already detailed the origins of its book collection and printing in his book "Shulin Qinghua." I have also compiled a chronicle of the Mao family and sons, which is published in the National Central Library Journal. Now, I will describe some trivial matters.

Jiguge used to house the manuscript copy of "Tiewang Shanhu" in fourteen volumes by Zhu Xingfu. Zijin once widely solicited poems for it. His son, Fuji, later pawned it to someone in exchange for ginseng to treat his illness. In the early years of the Republic of China, it suddenly appeared at the antique shop of Xiao Ruqing on Temple Front Street in the town. Ruqing lacked the ability to appraise it, and it was bought by Gui Zhian, a local resident, for ten silver dollars. Zhian then named himself the "Treasure Coral Pavilion Master" and wrote a poem to express his joy. He also reprinted one or two pages with moldy inscriptions by famous people. Each page of this book had the "Jiguge" collection seal. Zhian imitated this and also stamped a collection seal on each page, which detracted from its value. Later, it was pawned to the Shen Fanggu family in the town. Fanggu's son repeatedly invited me to view it, but I delayed and failed to do so. I heard that it has now changed hands again.

Many descendants of the Jiguge family practice medicine near Qixing Bridge and are no longer known for collecting books. Years ago, my friend Cao Jiusheng visited Yin Lake to search for books and learned that most of the Mao family's books were sold by weight. Some of their descendants were addicted to gambling and divination. Therefore, he only obtained the old manuscript copy of "Mr. Zijin's Deeds" and the Ming edition of "Jiang Jiang Ji" to take back. However, "Deeds" contains many anecdotes about Jiguge, and I used it extensively for my chronicle. "Jiang Jiang Ji" is also not recorded in the catalogs of other libraries. The Siku Quanshu lists it in its list of works that only survive with title, indicating that it is also a rare book in the country.

There are many people in Changshu City who claim to be descendants of "Jiguge." This is like the Wang family always claiming to be from the "Three Scholar Trees," the Tao family always claiming to be from the "Five Willows," and the Zhang family always claiming to be from the "Hundred Tolerances." Their genealogy may not be complete. However, it shows that Zijin's book collection is admired by many.

The "Maobian paper" and "Mao Tai paper" of today were created by the Mao family. "Maobian" is the paper specially made by Mao's printing house, and "Mao Tai" is the Tai character size paper specially made by Mao's printing house.

In recent times, Tao Lanquan has collected the most books printed by Jiguge. He has spent more than thirty years of effort and has collected more than 540 types, but he is still not complete. I once saw "Jianghu Sanren Ji" at Shen Shirun's Xirenzhai. Few collectors know its name, and it is one of the rare books in the country.

Although Jiguge printed many books, only one or two types in the history section and several types in the collection section are excellent. However, he sold the fields attached to the city to engage in engraving, which people considered a good thing. I say it takes a hundred times more courage. Do wealthy people today have this style? The publishing industry is on the verge of extinction. Even if it is called foolishness, its foolishness is truly unattainable.

The Honeymoon is Not Sweet by Liu An

Two famous sociologists in New York recently asked one hundred young married women for their true opinions about their honeymoon trips. The result was that fifty-two young women definitely stated that they did not feel any pleasure on their honeymoon. Two said that their honeymoon was simply "terrible." Only seventeen said that they had a very pleasant honeymoon.

The Mississippi State Social Health Association also conducted a similar test, and the result was that more than 60% of the brides felt more pain than pleasure on their honeymoon trips.

The main reasons are: (1) They are extremely tired from preparing for the wedding. They originally hoped to rest during the honeymoon, but they did not expect the trip to be very tiring, so their spirits were low and their tempers were bad. (2) Too much money is spent, so the new couple is worried. Sometimes they argue in order to save money.

Do You Have Insomnia? by Yanbo

When Napoleon was at the height of his military success, he slept at most four or five hours within every twenty-four-hour period. During this period, he showed amazing performance in both physical and intellectual strength. When he inspected the front lines on horseback, he often stayed on horseback for ten hours in a row. When he returned to camp, he immediately held meetings with his staff until late at night. After the meeting was over, he called in his secretary, gave him instructions, wrote many letters, carefully reviewed them, revised them, reviewed them again, and then signed them. He was like a heavenly dog, never feeling tired.

However, later, the Battle of Waterloo shattered his dream of conquering the world, and he was exiled to the lonely island of Saint Helena. At that time, his lifestyle suddenly underwent a tremendous change. He used to need only four or five hours of sleep, but now he was almost lazy all day with nothing to do, but he had to sleep eight or nine hours a night.

Is it true that the busier you are, the less sleep you need?

Modern psychologists are actually saying: That's right.

When they treat patients with insomnia, they no longer focus on teaching them how to "fall asleep," but on teaching those patients to work well when they are awake. Doctors say that as long as people can develop interest in their work, and this work can also increase their prestige and status—making them feel different from others—then no matter how long the working hours are and how short the sleeping hours are, it doesn't matter at all and will not affect their health.

It is said that there was a gambler who could stay awake for several days and nights when he was winning money, and his spirits were still very good. If his luck suddenly changed and he turned defeat into victory, he had to go to bed for more than ten hours. Gambling is certainly not "work," but the relationship between a person's mood and sleep can be seen.

Someone once visited the great inventor Edison, and Edison expressed the following grand theory:

He said: Sleeping is really just a senseless bad habit. Although we can't get rid of it for a while, we will eventually get rid of it slowly. Most people sleep as much as eight or nine hours a day, and as a result, they often feel tired. In fact, humans don't need to sleep at all. In the future, everyone will sleep much shorter than they do now—just as we sleep much less now than our ancestors did. People used to work at sunrise and rest at sunset, so of course they slept longer than we do. I believe that in a million years, everyone will not need beds at all.

Edison's words may be a bit too much, but he himself certainly practiced what he preached, reducing the "bad habit" of sleeping to the lowest limit.

Among the famous figures in history, such as Frederick the Great, who had great military achievements, such as the great German poet Schiller, such as the famous physicist Humboldt, such as the British surgical authority Hunter, such as the great German pathologist Virchow, they were all extremely busy with affairs, and everyone only slept four or five hours a day.

The so-called "eighteen hours of sleep" is a quote from the ancient British King Alfred the Great. Because people think Alfred was a smart and talented good emperor, they feel that what he said will never be wrong. But they don't know that this sentence was quoted incorrectly. He said, "One-third of the day is used for eating, sleeping, and exercise." The meaning is that the time spent on these three things should add up to one-third of the day. This is not a distortion of what he said. Alfred himself never slept more than six hours a night.

What's the big deal about insomnia? Maybe there is no such thing as "insomnia" in the world!

Rice and Salt by Gongsun Wu

I don't know how much grain is enough to feed the population. Today, food is calculated by weight, and there are scientific methods. How can a non-expert comment rashly? Mencius, in the Royal System, said that a lord's salary could feed four senior officials, a senior official could feed seventy-two people, and a lord could feed two hundred and eighty-eight people. Zhang Taiyan said, "In ancient times, one sheng was equivalent to two he in modern times. According to the Rites of Zhou, in a good year, a person ate two shi, five dou, and six sheng, which is equivalent to thirty shi, seven dou, and two sheng. This is equivalent to six shi, one dou, four sheng, and four shao today. Because it also included hemp and beans, this number was obtained." Did ancient people eat so much? Until the eleventh year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty, the salt trade was fixed at four hundred jin per yin. Lin Zexu said, "Each person eats three qian of salt per day, and each yin of four hundred jin of salt is enough to feed sixty people for a whole year." The estimate of three qian is probably not wrong. Recently, I saw a food bill for a government agency. The settlement for November and December of the 37th year of the Republic of China showed that about fifty people ate. Each person ate seven he and six shao of rice, seven qian of soybean oil, eight qian and two fen of soy sauce, and four qian and four fen of salt per day. This agency was in Shanghai. At that time, the price of rice in Shanghai was about 2.5 million yuan per shi. With such high prices, there was no reason to waste, so it is credible. The measurement uses the modern market system.

Miscellaneous Notes from a Mouse Peeking into the Pavilion by Yushou by Yushou

### Wu Qingyuan

A Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo stated that Wu Qingyuan is currently competing with the Japanese chess master Honinbo Shusai and has already won one game. This report is not detailed enough and also contains historical inaccuracies. For example, it says that Qingyuan was taken to Japan by Shusai from Beijing twenty years ago and extravagantly claims that Qingyuan's entry into the chess academy was entirely due to Shusai's efforts, but it does not know that this is contrary to the facts.

Qingyuan is the son of Wu Yulong, a Fujianese. Yulong was a former official in Beijing and was also able to play chess, but not skillfully. Qingyuan was outstanding in chess at the age of nine and became famous at the age of thirteen. Yulong died soon after in poverty, and the family became even more difficult. His mother ordered him to treat Gu Shuiru as a foster father, and he followed Shuiru to the door of Duan Hefei, receiving a monthly stipend of one hundred yuan. When Hefei was defeated, Qingyuan was very confused. The Japanese seventh-dan master Inukai Seki, with the chess academy's authorization, summoned him to Japan, promising that his mother and brother could go with him. All expenses were borne by the Japanese financial magnate Okura, which had nothing to do with Honinbo Shusai. Moreover, when Qingyuan first entered the chess academy, Inukai strongly advocated giving him the third dan, but Shusai still thought it was presumptuous and only allowed the first dan. There was a fierce debate during the discussion. Then, Shusai personally tested him in three games, giving him two stones in two games and three stones in one game. Qingyuan used a free and concise new strategy to defeat Shusai three times, and the title was determined. Shusai came from a fishmonger's background, was crude and uneducated, and was also narrow-minded. Because Qingyuan joined Inukai's faction as a disciple as soon as he arrived in Japan instead of following him, he deeply resented him and tried every means to thwart him. The Central News Agency reporter said that Qingyuan's achievements in Japan were all due to Shusai's recognition and selection, which is a serious misunderstanding of history.

In 1934, Qingyuan officially competed with Shusai in Tokyo. Although he lost by two points, his strategy was novel, his moves were quick, and his composure was calm. It seemed that he had a high degree of cultivation. Japanese public opinion even praised him as a master who would define an era. In fact, Qingyuan lost his education in his early years and knew nothing but Go. However, he was honest and sincere, and he did not like to be proud. Therefore, he could still give people a pure and cautious feeling.

For ten years, Qingyuan has been known in Japan as an invincible black stone holder. No one has the confidence to give him the first move. Shusai is gradually getting old and tired, and he is no exception. The Central News Agency reporter said that Wu had just won one game, which is very credible.

Laiyang Pear by Zhuying

Laiyang pear is a special product of Laiyang County, Shandong Province, and is known as a fine product along with Feicheng peach and Leling jujube. Large pears weigh one jin and five or six liang, while small pears can weigh three or two pieces per jin. The fruit is oblong and round, and the skin is green and rough. Those that are delicate, light in color, strong in flavor, and fragrant are not genuine products. Those with small golden spots on the skin are the most sweet and delicious, with no residue and no fragrance. Pears are harvested after the Mid-Autumn Festival.

Pear trees bloom in late spring, with white flowers that have five petals and very long stems, like white crabapple. When they bloom, the trees are covered in silver, and the fragrance of the flowers is intoxicating. When the east wind rises, swarms of wasps surround the trees, staying there all night, which is not without damage to the pears. Pear trees are also prone to insects. Pear farmers hire workers to catch bees and insects under the trees all day long, which is very laborious.

The trees are not very tall, with a girth of about one arm span, and the trunk is no more than three or four feet long, forming a round canopy like a car cover. After the flowers fall, the fruit gradually grows larger and larger. The fruit is plentiful, and the branches droop to the ground, making it easy to pick.

Trees can bear fruit five or six years after grafting, but gradually bear less after seventeen or eighteen years. They bear the most fruit around ten years.

Laiyang farmers mostly grow pears for a living, in order to make large profits. Pear trees form forests in the four townships of Laiyi. The sandy soil of the Wulong River oxbow lake area, twenty li southeast of the city, produces the best pears, which are the true Laiyang pears. However, the area is only a few dozen mu.

### Thorough Implementation of Direct Goods and Two-Tax Agency Merger

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] This reporter, to understand the circumstances of the merger of direct goods and two-tax agencies, specifically visited the financial authorities. It is said that the issue of merging direct goods and two-tax agencies has been noted by people in society during the Anti-Japanese War, and the successive People's Political Councils have also considered this a matter of urgent importance. However, due to various difficulties at that time, it has not been realized until now. Now, at the beginning of constitutional governance, national expenditures are vast. In order to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and rectify tax administration, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan for a decision to thoroughly merge the direct goods and two-tax agencies of this ministry from top to bottom. In addition to changing the two administrations to the National Taxation Administration, each province will be changed to the National Taxation Bureau, and the important counties and cities will be divided into the National Taxation Collection Bureau. A total of sixteen original two-tax district bureaus and eighty branch bureaus have been abolished. In the future, the management of the two taxes will be unified and the business will be centralized. In terms of tax collection, the effect of mutual assistance can be achieved, and it will also be convenient for merchants to pay taxes. As for the tax officials who originally served in the direct goods and two taxes, most of them have passed the examination and training or have been qualified through selection. In the past, they have made contributions and should be allowed to retain their original positions and continue to serve. Although there will be reductions according to the new system, there are also reasonable and fair standards set.

### Northeast Support Association for the July 5th Incident to Hold Mass Meeting on August 1st; Northeast People's Comfort Group Makes Four Demands in Beiping

[This newspaper, Shenyang, 26th] The Northeast People's Support Association for the July 5th Massacre held a committee meeting on the 26th and decided to hold a mass meeting on August 1st to express its firm attitude towards the July 5th Massacre.

[Further Report] Middle and high school students in Shenyang and Dalian will hold an accusation meeting for the July 5th Massacre at the City Hall Square at 9:00 AM on the 27th and march in protest, demanding that the government quickly punish the perpetrators and properly handle the aftermath.

[Further Report] Wei Lihuang met with representatives of public opinion organizations on the 25th and agreed to forward a request to the central government to quickly punish the perpetrators of the July 5th Incident.

[This newspaper, Beiping, 26th] The Northeast People's Comfort Group hosted reporters on the 26th, and in a written statement demanded that the government: (1) Severely punish Xu Huidong, the culprit. (2) Severely punish Chen Jicheng, the Commander of the Garrison responsible for security, and the gunmen, specifying that the shooters were soldiers of the 208th Division. (3) Quickly resolve the education and living problems of Northeast students stranded in Beiping. (4) The current measures for restricting the circulation currency still need to be improved. Lin Yaoshan, Speaker of the Liaobei Provincial Council, said that 1.2 trillion in currency is issued every month, of which military expenses account for 50%, state-owned enterprises account for 40%, and local administrative expenses account for only 5%. Such a huge amount is placed on the people of the three northeastern cities, which is really unbearable. Restricting remittances to Beiping and Tianjin hurts the common people, while large amounts of capital mostly flow to Shanghai.

### Cutting off Railway Transport Between East and West Germany; Britain and the United States Implement a Counter-Blockade; The Three Powers in London Discuss Strategies Against the Soviet Union

[This newspaper]: A broadcast from London on the 26th stated that the ability of both Britain and the United States to cope with the Berlin situation has become stronger today. The occupation military governments of both sides, on the pretext of "technical difficulties," suddenly ordered the blockade of all railway transport between the Western Zone and the Soviet occupation zone, but mail and telegrams remained unobstructed. The so-called "technical difficulties" are actually a retaliatory action against the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin. When the Soviet Union ordered the cut-off of all land and water transportation between the western zone of Berlin and the outside world, it also used "technical difficulties" as an excuse. It is also learned that after the British and American military governments in Frankfurt ordered the blockade of all railway transportation between the Western Zone and East Germany today, more than 70,000 tons of supplies will not be able to start shipping. Most of these supplies come from Italy and were originally scheduled to be delivered to the East German occupation zone in early August.

[United Press, London, 26th] Senior British, American, and French representatives held talks for more than an hour in the office of the British Deputy Foreign Secretary Strang today to discuss new ways of negotiating with Moscow. Since the Foreign Ministers' meeting broke up unhappily last December, this three-power meeting is probably the most important. The London meeting came after a gathering of US military and diplomatic representatives in Berlin on the 25th. The series of meetings is understood to be related to the West's new policy on the Berlin crisis and the entire Soviet relationship. After the meeting, French Ambassador Massigli was the first to walk out of the venue, rush into the car, and rush to an appointment. Five minutes later, the American delegation appeared at the door, smiling for photographs, but refusing to speak. The members of the delegation included US Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, and State Department expert on Soviet issues Bohlen. In addition to Strong, the British representatives also included Dean, the Director of the Political Department of the Foreign Office's German Division. Although each representative refused to speak, this meeting clearly discussed new strategies for dealing with the Soviet Union, hoping to resolve the Berlin crisis and the entire German situation. A Foreign Office spokesman said that the final version of the new note to the Soviet Union has not yet been approved. "Several drafts will be sent to the three powers for study." British and American representatives met again on the afternoon of the 26th, and Foreign Secretary Bevin and British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson, who had asked for leave to return home, also attended. British Commander-in-Chief in Germany Robertson will fly back to London on the 27th to report on recent developments to Bevin before the House of Commons debate on diplomacy on the 28th.

### US Congressmen Observing the Situation in Berlin Believe It Will Not Lead to War; Soviet Bluster Will Eventually Yield

[United Press, Washington, 15th] According to today's announcement, members of Congress who are about to reconvene have been notified, stating that the Soviet Union's actions in Berlin are purely bluster, so there is no need to fear the United States being under the shadow of war. They have also been privately informed that intelligence reports from the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany indicate that the Soviet side is not prepared for military action to drive Western countries out. Britain, America, and France firmly refuse to withdraw from Berlin, and the Soviet Union will eventually yield. The congressmen who listened know that the three headquarters in the Soviet zone must know this.

Senior officials here said that the three powers may draft a new note this weekend to protest to Moscow again. According to official hints, the new note will denounce the Soviet Union's attempt to suppress its former allies from withdrawing from Berlin, which is a clear violation of the United Nations Charter. However, it is believed that if the Soviet Union is willing to lift the siege of Berlin and recognize the Allies' right to continue to station troops in Berlin, the West is willing to invite the Soviet Union to attend a four-power meeting to discuss the entire German issue. All congressmen who spoke with Clay agreed that, barring accidents, current US policy will ease the crisis.

### South's Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged, Still Maintaining Anti-Imperialist and Pro-Soviet Principles

[United Press, Belgrade, 26th] South's commander-in-chief, Kartelj, reported to the South Communist Congress on the 26th that "The Communist Party is fighting for the new Yugoslavia." In its foreign policy section, it stated that South's will continue to be anti-imperialist and pro-Soviet, and will not change due to the Communist Information Bureau's offensive. Kartelj listed the five major principles of South's foreign policy:

(1) Based on equality and the ideals of the United Nations, universally strive for peace and cooperation. (2) Cooperate economically with every country based on equality and mutual international obligations. (3) Support all forces and people's democratic countries that strive for peace and national liberation. (4) Support the Soviet Union's and people's democratic countries' anti-imperialist policies. (5) Develop cooperation with the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries in all matters and objects in terms of economic culture.

Observers believe that Kartelj's speech indicates that Yugoslavia's foreign policy remains unchanged, and judging from the third principle, South's will still aid General Markos' guerrillas in Greece.
