### North China剿總 Distributes Announcement to Hot River West Bandit Cadres

[Central News Agency, Chengde, 29th Dispatch] The North China剿總 recently distributed a "Letter to Bandit Rural Cadres" in western Hot River, citing the truth of the recent disastrous defeat of the Nie bandits and the grievances of veteran cadres such as Chen Shaoyu, Su Penghe, and Niu Yinguang who were squeezed out and sacrificed, calling on the bandit cadres to broaden their horizons, come over to the bright side, and show that the government is broad-minded and does not hold past actions against them. The letter also clarifies the purpose of suppressing the rebellion, which is not to protect wealthy farmers or implement a new land policy, but to aim at "land to the tillers," urging the blindly following bandit cadres to lay down their knives, return home, wait to be granted land, and enjoy farming. The Hot River Provincial Government is cooperating with this purpose and has selected Sanliugou to implement land reform first, and is also promoting the "Two-Five Rent Reduction." The Suiyuan District Headquarters has specially established a Youth Training Team to accommodate surrendered bandit soldiers and bandit cadres. Their living conditions are comparable to those of the National troops and are very comfortable. Upon completion of the training, they will be appropriately settled or given funds to return to their hometowns. To date, there have been several hundred people.

### Deng Wenyi Analyzes the War Situation, Emphasizes the Importance of Decisive Battle, Points Out That the Current War Concerns National Survival

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 29th Dispatch] Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, attended the regular press conference of the North China剿總 at 5:00 PM on the 29th and analyzed the current war situation, stating: In order to counter the bandits' autumn offensive and apply new strategies, the National troops are not wasting their strength and have recently abandoned many places on the surface. Some may think that the National troops are losing, but if the National troops concentrate their main force and strive for a decisive victory, the lost territory will eventually be recovered. Deng emphasized that the anti-bandit war from now on should be observed from the perspective of the victory or defeat of the main force decisive battle, and pointed out that today is definitely not a struggle between parties or a simple "civil war," but a war concerning national survival. Therefore, it is necessary to unleash all political, economic, and social forces to strive for military victory. Deng also reported on the war situation in various parts of the country, stating: (1) The bandits' "autumn offensive" has been underway for two months, and the focus is in the Northeast, where the bandits' strength is several times that of ours, giving them an advantage. The Jinzhou garrison consists of two armies, while the bandits have five columns. The same is true for Changchun. Therefore, both places have been abandoned one after another. The bandits suffered 40,000 casualties in Jinzhou. Yingkou has now been recovered, and the area between Shenyang and Yingkou has also been cleared. The bandits used the force that attacked Jinzhou to move to Dahushan and Heishan in western Liaoning, totaling one, two, three, eight, twelve, and two independent divisions, more than double the number of National troops in that area. The fighting is extremely fierce. The National troops are determined to do their utmost to defend Shenyang. Yingkou and Jinxi are intended to be developed, but it will still require arduous efforts to restore the situation in the Northeast. (2) In addition to the Northeast, the bandits' "autumn offensive" focuses on Central China. After the Chen Yi bandit troops captured Jinan, the bandits also suffered heavy losses, approximately over 95,000 people. In contrast, the National troops in Jinan numbered only 50,000 to 60,000, so the bandits actually suffered a loss. Chen Yi fears that the National troops will move north to recover Jinan, so he is actively building fortifications in western Shandong and attempting to cross the Longhai Railway and attack northern Jiangsu. In order to strike the main force of the bandits, the National troops have actively withdrawn from Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, without being constrained by the bandits, to avoid dispersing their forces. Recently, a decisive battle may be fought with the bandits in the border area of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong. (3) In North China, the Nie bandits are fleeing in three groups: one group on the Pinghan Railway, one group in eastern Chahar, and another group in Suiyuan. Recently, the battle in Guangou in the eastern section of the Pingsui Railway resulted in over 10,000 bandit deaths and injuries, while the National troops suffered 3,000 to 4,000 casualties, which is enough to show that the strength of the bandits is limited. (4) In Central China, the Liu Bocheng bandit troops are supporting the Chen Yi bandit troops, which is the same as the Mao bandit troops in North China supporting the Northeast to contain the National troops. The Liu bandit troops number less than ten columns and are scattered in the Pinghan Railway and western Henan. Now, their Second, Sixth, and Tenth Columns have been completely defeated by the National troops. (5) In the Northwest, the Peng Dehuai bandit troops attempted to contain the National troops from reinforcing Shanxi. Since the eighth and ninth of this month, they have been fleeing in Guanzhong. After the National troops attacked on the 10th, 11th, and 12th, the bandits suffered approximately 25,000 casualties. In other words, after Peng's five columns were defeated one and a half columns, they lost about one-third of their strength.

(3) All remitters to the interior should clearly state the names and addresses of themselves and the recipients, as well as the purpose of the remittance, for review. (4) Those who must apply to the Central Bank for an over-the-limit remittance to the interior for legitimate purposes should submit detailed reasons in advance to the Central Bank for review. If it is deemed necessary, the Central Bank may notify them to handle it appropriately. However, the Central Bank should still report to the Ministry on a monthly basis for record. (5) The amount of cash that can be transported into Customs from Shenyang and other places shall not exceed 1,000 Gold Yuan per person. Violators will have the excess amount deposited in a special account in the local Central Bank, and a three-month certificate of deposit will be issued, which will be returned upon maturity. The above regulations apply equally to money houses and banks. As for the review standards for remittances, the so-called legitimate purposes should meet the following requirements: (A) If banks or money houses in Shenyang and other places have outstanding balances with branches or counterparts in other places due to past transactions that have not been made up, they must submit account statements to prove it. (B) If commercial firms and manufacturers in Shenyang and other places purchase daily necessities or production raw materials and equipment from other places and must remit funds, they must have the approval of the Chamber of Commerce or industry association and submit receipts.

Remittances from officers and soldiers should also be handled in accordance with the measures formulated by the Four-Organization Joint Office. Remittances from public employees should still be certified by the authorities of the affiliated institutions and schools, and they should be responsible for the overall application.

### Cleveland Returns to the United States

### Control Yuan Proposes Economic Corrective Action, Message to Executive Yuan Urging Saving the Serious Situation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th Dispatch] The joint meeting of the Economic Resources, Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Committee, the Finance and Grain Policy Committee, and the Interior and Land Policy Committee of the Control Yuan has sent the corrective action proposed for the current economic situation to the Executive Yuan on the 29th. The reason for the case is: "The administrative authorities have made mistakes in the implementation of the financial and economic reform program, and the steps are chaotic, causing the serious phenomena of reduced production, escape of goods, loose money supply, no market, and black market today. It should be corrected. The original case stated: The government's promulgation of emergency financial and economic measures is aimed at stabilizing prices and ensuring people's livelihood, but since implementation, in less than three months, there have been phenomena of reduced production, escape of materials, panic buying, and rampant black market, and the situation is becoming more widespread and serious. The following points should be paid attention to in order to quickly save the situation:

(1) The emergency financial and economic measures rigidly freeze various prices on August 19, but the political efficiency of various places has failed to match the economic measures, resulting in food and daily necessities prices being higher in production areas than in sales areas, and raw materials being higher than costs. As a result, the sources of daily necessities in sales areas and the raw materials required by factories have dried up, affecting production and even leading to panic buying, no market, and rampant black markets.

(2) After the price freeze, the escape of materials is inevitable. The government should have realized the possibility of this fact and should have taken precautions early. Especially for the necessities of people's lives, such as food, oil, salt, fuel, and cloth, the relevant competent departments should make proper overall plans, broaden sources, and strengthen control. However, for several months, there have been no effective measures to control and regulate materials.

(3) After the issuance of the Gold Yuan, the government has failed to actively guide the flow of funds, and the foreign currency gold and silver collected from the people has not been used properly. Furthermore, the sale of shares in state-owned enterprises, the increase of capital in banks and money houses, and the disposal of enemy and puppet property have not been effectively implemented quickly, causing the Gold Yuan held by the people to become a large amount of floating capital, loosening the money supply, affecting the credit of the currency, and causing panic in the market.

(4) The original plan for emergency economic measures had a fixed deadline for the redemption of gold and silver and the use of legal tender. However, the date for the redemption of gold and silver was suddenly extended. The government used the control of gold and silver as a means to increase the issuance of Gold Yuan. All the rampant black markets for gold and silver foreign currency, the escape and shortage of materials, and the panic buying phenomena occurred before and after the government announced the extension of the gold and silver redemption period. Was this kind of reaction anticipated at the beginning, and was there an effective plan to address this possible problem?

(5) Public employees are well known to live in poverty. If a solution is not found quickly, the administration will never be clean. Currently, the living compensation of public employees is still frozen at the August 19 standard, and daily needs have long been unable to make ends meet. Recently, they are trying to survive in panic buying, struggling in hunger day after day. The impact of this is unimaginable. In summary, it is evident that the government failed to be cautious at the beginning and failed to remedy the situation in time. During the implementation period, either the purpose of the policy was not understood, or the implementation techniques were ignored, resulting in such disastrous consequences for a major policy concerning the national economy and people's livelihood. We express our deep regret for the rampant problems and specially propose this corrective action."

### Legislative Yuan Meeting Discusses Prices; Rescue the Economic Crisis Proposal Changed to Questioning Session

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] The fifteenth session of the second term of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 29th, chaired by President Sun. The meeting commenced at 9:30 AM, initially passing twelve reported items. Proposals submitted by the Executive Yuan were distributed to relevant committees for review. Subsequently, several temporary reports were heard, including the Executive Yuan's written response to Yang Gonghui's previous questioning regarding the unreasonable handling of public prices, and the Procedural Committee's proposal to strengthen legislative efficiency. Immediately afterwards, Chen Mingxian put forward a temporary emergency motion, listing ten measures to be resolved and delivered to the government for implementation, to save the current economic crisis and relieve the people's suffering. The listed measures include: (1) Slightly borrowing from wealthy families' assets to fund the suppression of unrest; (2) Levying on major households hoarding supplies for sale at fair prices; (3) Allocating foreign exchange to purchase essential goods and raw materials from abroad; (4) Purchasing supplies from bandit-controlled areas at high prices to prevent the outflow of materials; (5) Controlling daily necessities and strictly implementing rationing; (6) Opening up industrial loans, ensuring the supply of raw materials, and encouraging processing and increased production; (7) Opening up agricultural loans and planning for increased production; (8) Removing price limits on daily necessities, but increasing tax rates to increase national treasury revenue and subsidize rationing expenses; (9) Adjusting the prices of state-owned enterprises, improving management, and reducing waste; (10) Increasing the salaries of public servants and teachers, in addition to in-kind distribution, and making reasonable adjustments based on the price index. After Chen explained the purpose and measures, various committee members spoke in succession, engaging in heated discussions, particularly regarding differing opinions on "price limits" and "negotiated prices," leading to considerable debate. Some committee members also launched fierce attacks on the administrative authorities. However, the majority did not advocate for concrete resolutions, stating that the government's emergency financial measures were all promulgated by the president through orders based on temporary provisions, and the Legislative Yuan should not interfere midway. A final vote passed, following the previous example of similar temporary motions by Wen Shiyuan and others, to submit a question to the Executive Yuan in the name of all members of the Legislative Yuan.

Editorial

### Viewing the World from Stalin's Speech

Soviet leader Stalin met with reporters from *Pravda* on the 28th, answering questions and clarifying Soviet policy. A summary of Stalin's remarks includes the following key points: (1) He does not foresee the possibility of a new world war breaking out. (2) He condemned the attempts by Britain and the United States to launch a new world war through their "policy of aggression," but stated that "the instigators of a new war will ultimately fail." (3) He regarded the Anglo-American-French referral of the Berlin issue to the Security Council as an "expression of aggression" by the Western Allies. (4) He also considered the six neutral countries in the Security Council to be supporting the Anglo-American policy of aggression. (5) He revealed that discussions on the Berlin issue in Moscow had twice reached an agreement, but the negotiations failed because Britain and the United States were not sincerely willing to negotiate and cooperate with the Soviet Union.

Stalin rarely meets with reporters and does not easily make statements. It is remembered that to support Wallace's presidential campaign, he met with reporters on May 17, expressing his support for the US-Soviet cooperation plan proposed by Wallace, calling it a "good and hopeful basis" for the US and the Soviet Union to conduct negotiations to resolve differences. Now, more than five months later, the release of this statement has its own important effect, especially in today's global atmosphere of depression and public anxiety, and is particularly worthy of our attention.

The "Cold War" between the United States and the Soviet Union is intensifying, not only making the world's polarization more distinct, but also making the "Cold War" bleed and heat up, and may turn into a real war. The United Nations General Assembly was held in the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, which not only failed to reverse the international reverse current, but also made the "knot" between the East and West poles tighter and tighter. Britain and the United States accuse the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin of endangering world peace, while the Soviet Union condemns Britain and the United States as "war mongers" and "instigators of a new war." The two sides not only argued endlessly, but also followed up with action. In the past month, we have seen a series of facts on the international stage: on the one hand, five Western European countries have established a joint defense headquarters, and appointed British Chief of the General Staff Marshal Montgomery as the Supreme Commander of the Western European Allied Forces, and will negotiate with the United States and Canada to conclude a seven-nation North Atlantic military alliance treaty. During the British Imperial Conference, all autonomous territories were worried about the insecurity of their defenses, and will also work hard to reorganize their military forces in the future. On the other hand, there is the brewing of the Eastern European alliance, and the Soviet Union is actively strengthening its position within the Iron Curtain: within the Soviet Union, it is concentrating all its efforts to build a huge submarine fleet in case of emergency. In addition, the expansion of the labor unrest in France, the rebellion in South Korea, the turmoil in Southeast Asian countries, the spread of harassment by the Chinese Communists, and everything else, all show the tension of the international situation, and the feeling of being frightened several times a night, with the mountain rain coming and the wind filling the building, therefore, making the survivors of the post-war era not panic about whether today's world has reached the edge of the outbreak of war again?

Judging by common sense, the bloodstains of the Second World War have not yet dried, and all those who have a little rationality and conscience, whether they are the people of the Soviet Union and the countries within its Iron Curtain, or the people of Britain, the United States and other democratic countries, after deep reflection, as long as they do not forget the painful lessons of the Second World War, no one will welcome an international war. Although there is a call for "preventing war" in the United States today, and public opinion is unanimously opposed to the government's adoption of a "policy of appeasement" towards the Soviet Union, it is by no means intended to immediately open the bloody curtain of the Third World War. On the Soviet side, although it is spreading the seeds of turmoil around the world, creating unrest throughout the world, but in terms of its own interests, the Soviet Union is determined not to want to start a war lightly at this time before it has created the atomic bomb. Now, from Stalin's speech, we can also see that Stalin at this time still does not dare to reach the back of human rationality and conscience, and openly announce that the Soviet Union does not resign from a war. Therefore, humanity's love of peace, rationality and conscience are the only powerful guarantees for world peace today.

However, although the Third World War has not yet reached the edge of its outbreak today, if all parties are on edge and have been on edge for a long time, it may also turn fake into reality. Fortunately, humanity's love of peace, rationality and conscience can still prompt anyone not to start a war lightly at this time. Looking at the world from Stalin's speech, we believe that although today's world is in the midst of thousands of disasters, it is too early to say that the Third World War will break out soon.

### Sichuan Province Strictly Urges the Outward Transportation of Grain; Two County Magistrates Held Accountable for Negligence

Wang Lingji's Admonishment to Commissioners and County Magistrates

[Our Chongqing Dispatch on the 29th] Wang Lingji's admonishment to the commissioners and county magistrates on the 28th: (1) The central government limited Sichuan's grain to 500,000 large bales to be cleared by November and December. Currently, the grain from the counties along the river is being allocated first, and it has been found that two major counties have hoarded grain and failed to pay. The county magistrate will be dismissed and held accountable. (2) The household registration in Sichuan's 144 counties is poor. Most household registration books have not been completed, and those that have been completed are mostly falsified. County magistrates cite a lack of funds as an excuse and have never handled identity cards. It is hoped that they will not procrastinate again. (3) The anti-bandit training class in Sichuan has ended. Each county will set up a Communist liquidation committee. Each county has designated six people as a protection team to thoroughly eliminate latent bandits.

### Supplementary Measures for Land Prices and Land Tax Collection Announced and Implemented by the Executive Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] After the currency reform, the Executive Yuan stipulated supplementary measures for land prices and land tax collection, which were announced and implemented. Among them, it is stipulated that land prices calculated in legal currency should be converted into gold yuan, but if the original price is too low, and the conversion results in a price lower than the pre-war land price or the actual land price, adjustments and corrections should be made with reference. In areas where land registration is being organized or land prices are being re-evaluated, adjustments and conversions should be made in accordance with these regulations, and then announced. Land value tax, land registration fees, and compensation for land prices, as well as land rents and land prices for leased and distributed land, collected according to the legal currency land price, should be handled in accordance with these regulations. Those already collected are exempt from conversion. The calculation of supplementary land value-added tax is based on: (1) Before the currency reform, land transfers calculated in legal currency should be converted into gold yuan. (2) After the currency reform, if the original land price for land transfers is calculated in legal currency, it should be adjusted according to the price index and converted into gold yuan before calculating according to law.

### Stalin's Statement on the Berlin Problem: The U.S. Rebukes It as Inconsistent with Actions, Believing It Intends to Evade Responsibility for the Crisis

[United Press, Washington, 29th] The U.S. government responded coldly to Stalin's statement on the Berlin dispute. The State Department issued a brief statement saying that the points indicated by the Soviet Union had already been proven inaccurate by the White Paper issued by the Western powers on September 26 after the failure of the four-power negotiations on the Berlin issue in Moscow. State Department press officer McDermott said, "We will not comment on it; the White Paper is a complete and accurate record of everything that happened."

[United Press, London, 29th] A British Foreign Office spokesman criticized Stalin's statement today while receiving reporters, saying that the British government was "very surprised" by Stalin's attacks on the six neutral countries in the Security Council, who were trying to facilitate a compromise on the Berlin crisis.

[U.S. Information Service, Paris, 29th] A Chinese spokesman said, "The six neutral countries have done their best to ease political tensions." He declared, "If Stalin calls this an act of war, then so be it."

[United Press, Washington, 28th] People here believe that Stalin's statement may have been issued for several purposes: (1) To attempt to shift the blame for the current crisis and the failure to reach a compromise onto the Western powers. (2) To spread war panic and create chaos by declaring that the division between East and West is almost impossible to resolve. (3) To confuse world public opinion by blaming the Western powers. (4) It may be to give last-minute support to Wallace's campaign.

[United Press, Paris, 29th] The Western delegation to the United Nations stated on the 29th that they were concerned that Stalin's condemnation of the West was a sign of the Soviet Union intensifying the Cold War between East and West. Not only would the Soviet representative to the United Nations strengthen his accusations against the West during the debate on the Berlin issue, but the Cold War would also be launched worldwide. Stalin's statement alarmed many representatives, leading them to abandon their small hope of resolving the Berlin crisis early. Stalin's claims about the West's aggressive policies and the Western leaders' plans to start a new war were nothing new. Molotov had frequently made such statements in international conferences over the past three years. However, the Western delegation considered it important that Stalin personally attacked the Western powers, which was the first time this had happened. In the past, when the situation was deadlocked, Western representatives had repeatedly called on Stalin to extend a conciliatory hand. When the United Nations delegation met on the 29th, they all inquired about the meaning of Stalin's statement. Did it indicate a major change in Soviet policy? Or did Stalin abandon hope of compromise with the West? Or was Stalin impatient with world public opinion's opposition to the Soviet Union? Or had the actions of the United Nations produced considerable results? No delegation could answer these questions.

### Security Council Postpones Vote on Sanctions Against Israel, Reportedly Due to Truman's Intervention

[Our Report] Paris, 29th Broadcast: According to diplomatic sources, President Truman's last-minute intervention prevented the United Nations from taking action on the proposal to sanction Israel. The Security Council postponed the vote on the joint British-Chinese proposal to next Tuesday (November 2nd). The U.S. delegation neither confirmed nor denied the news that this postponement of the vote was brought about by Truman's intervention.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] After the Israeli government formally requested direct negotiations with the Egyptian government, the Security Council unanimously adopted a Canadian proposal this morning to form a special committee to prepare revisions to the original text of the Security Council's resolution on Palestine. The members of this committee include representatives from China, Britain, Belgium, France, and Ukraine, and will be assisted by Acting Mediator Bunche.

The Canadian proposal was passed after the Canadian representative, McNaughton, pointed out that all efforts should be made to transform the Palestinian truce into a real peace. The passage of this proposal completely overturned the joint British-Chinese proposal of the 28th, which called for the imposition of economic and other sanctions under the Charter against the offending party. Before the Canadian proposal was passed, Israeli representative Eban again vehemently attacked the joint British-Chinese proposal, saying that it would only exacerbate the Nikif crisis, and he emphasized that the only task currently before the Security Council was to order both sides to begin negotiations for a real peace. The Security Council will continue to examine the Palestinian issue on November 2nd.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th] The Israeli government suddenly announced today its willingness to begin negotiations with the Egyptian government, either directly or through the mediation of the United Nations mediator, to clarify the various differences between the two governments. However, sources close to the Egyptian delegation claim that Egypt will still insist on its determined position not to negotiate directly with the Israeli government, because Egypt has not yet recognized the existence of the Israeli government.

[Agence France-Presse, Tel Aviv, 28th] Israeli Prime Minister Gurion told Parliament today that the Israeli army will never retreat to the positions it held before the start of the Nikif battle on October 14.

### The Political Committee Decides to Continue Studying the Greek Issue

The Soviet Union Demands the Withdrawal of Foreign Troops Stationed in Greece

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] The United Nations Political Committee met today and passed a motion to continue studying the Greek issue until it has been fully debated by a vote of 34 to 11 (with 5 abstentions, including the Soviet Union). Therefore, the issues to be studied by the Political Committee today include the following: (1) The Greek issue; (2) The disarmament issue; (3) The Palestinian issue. The Disarmament Subcommittee presented a draft to the representatives today, and the eight-day deadline for studying the Palestinian issue will end tomorrow.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 28th] The Soviet Union today demanded the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in Greece and the dissolution of the United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans. Vyshinsky reiterated the Soviet Union's position of a year ago in the United Nations Political Committee, accusing Britain and the United States of interfering in Greece. He considered the work of the Special Committee to be a pile of rubbish, and he flatly rejected the joint British-Chinese-French-American proposal to extend the Special Committee for another year.

### Soviet Ambassador Asks the United States to Publicize the Contents of the Military Conference in Japan. The U.S. State Department Replies That It Was Only a Routine Matter.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th, United Press] The United States has summarily rejected the Soviet Union's request to obtain information about the secret meeting of U.S. military leaders in Japan on October 12. The reason given by the United States is that this is not a matter for the Soviet Union. The U.S. State Department's reply came only hours after the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Panyushkin, made the above request to the Allied Far Eastern Commission. The State Department replied that MacArthur, as the U.S. Supreme Commander in the Pacific, could often hold military conferences with senior officers, which was only a routine matter related to the U.S. government. The State Department also said that Ambassador Panyushkin's statement regarding the Yokosuka base was completely unfounded. This base has always been used by the U.S. Navy to support the Allied Supreme Commander in implementing occupation goals. Therefore, the implication that the Far Eastern decision on basic policies toward Japan after Japan's surrender had been grossly violated was groundless. The Tokyo meeting mentioned by Panyushkin was purely a routine military conference and was different from the purposes reported in various news outlets.

### Secretary Marshall Suddenly Flies to London

### The Only Way to Prevent Communist Aggression is to Use the Atomic Bomb, Churchill Says in British House of Commons Speech

[United Press, London, 28th] Churchill said in the House of Commons on the 28th that any matter of self-defense in Western Europe must rely on the assistance of the United States. He said that, given the crisis of war that had been uttered at the lips of all diplomats, the only way to prevent Europe from being invaded and enslaved by communist labor under the guidance of the Kremlin was the atomic bomb. He said, "The military preparations being carried out in Western Europe can never be better than the armies that have accepted foreign aid to build over the past many years, and are far from the power of the atomic bomb to prevent war. Therefore, we will rely on the full support of the great republic across the Atlantic for the military deployments that are being carried out." He said that unnecessary obstacles should not be placed on the path of "rebuilding Germany," and he called for a stop to anti-Nazi trials.

### Stalin Talks About the Berlin Problem, Condemns British and American Aggressive Policies, Declares the Failure of Agreements Is Not the Fault of the Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 28th] Stalin broke his long silence and published a response to reporters' inquiries in Pravda today, condemning the Western countries' aggressive intentions toward the Soviet Union and their deliberate sabotage of the conclusion of agreements. Most of the questions and answers concerned the Berlin issue and U.S. policy. Stalin's answers were as follows:

(1) The Security Council's discussion of the Berlin issue, as well as the attitude of the British and American delegations, clearly showed the aggressiveness of British and American policies. (2) Regarding the simultaneous lifting of traffic restrictions and the unification of Berlin's currency system, the three Western powers and the Soviet Union had actually reached an agreement in Moscow on August 30. This agreement did not harm the prestige of anyone, but respected the interests of both sides and guaranteed further cooperation. However, the British and American governments denied the work of their special envoys in Moscow, considered the agreement invalid, and submitted the Berlin issue to the Security Council. (3) Before the Security Council voted on the Berlin issue, an agreement to resolve the Berlin issue was also reached during informal meetings in Paris. After the President of the Security Council, Brahmagreia, met with Vyshinsky, there was indeed a draft resolution that could allow both sides to consult with each other. However, the British and American representatives again denied this agreement. Therefore, British and American policies clearly did not want an agreement, nor did they want cooperation, but only wanted empty talk to cover up their aggressive policies, and to shift the responsibility for the failure of the agreement onto the Soviet Union, and falsely accuse cooperation with the Soviet Union as being impossible. War instigators are afraid of truly concluding agreements with the Soviet Union, because this will shake their position of instigating war. The Western countries submitted the Berlin issue to the Security Council, believing that they could control the Security Council and do whatever they wanted. Stalin emphasized that the current policies of Britain and the United States "are policies of aggression and instigation of war," and that the six neutral countries, including China, Canada, Belgium, Ecuador, and Colombia, supported "policies of aggression in preparation for war." Stalin replied when answering the sixth and final question, "Everything can only lead the instigators of war to a shameful defeat. The main leader of war instigation, Churchill, has lost the trust of his people and of democrats around the world. Other war instigators cannot escape the same fate as Churchill. The people of the world have fresh memories of the horrors of war, and the public opinion that craves peace is strong and powerful, and will never allow Churchill and others to launch another new war that is beneficial to themselves."

Public and Private Organizations' Rice Purchases Limited to One *Dou* per Person per Month

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau previously issued purchase certificates to facilitate public and private institutions' purchase of rice from rice-producing areas, for inspection by relevant authorities along the way. The calculation of purchase limits for rice procurement in producing areas was originally based on three *dou* per person per month, with one *dou* allocated, and an additional two *dou* allowed to be purchased, up to a maximum of two months' supply. The Social Affairs Bureau received a telegram from the Ministry of Food yesterday, instructing that it should be changed to two *dou* per person per month, with one *dou* allocated, and one *dou* allowed to be self-procured, still adhering to the maximum limit of two months' supply based on the actual number of employees currently employed by each institution. The Social Affairs Bureau has decided to implement this calculation method starting today.

Furthermore, some of the purchase certificates issued by the Social Affairs Bureau have reached their expiration dates. A public notice urging their return was issued yesterday. If certificate holders delay in returning them, in addition to strict reminders based on the stubs, no further certificates will be issued for rice procurement in the future.

Today is the Last Day for Exchanging Gold and Foreign Currency

Those Found Concealing Them Thereafter Will Be Severely Punished

The deadline for the exchange of gold and foreign currency, as announced by the Ministry of Finance, was extended to the end of this month. The 31st of tomorrow falls on a Sunday holiday, so today is the last day for the exchange. Authorities have stated that there will be no further extensions after this deadline. After thorough preparations by the inspection authorities in recent days, a large-scale operation to hunt down gold and banknotes will be launched after the exchange deadline. Actions will begin next week. Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo has paid close attention to this matter after returning to Shanghai. Yesterday, he separately summoned relevant parties to give instructions. At that time, all relevant units will cooperate in the operation, paying particular attention to wealthy and prominent households. Anyone found privately hoarding and not exchanging will be subject to severe punishment in addition to the confiscation of gold and banknotes.

[Another Report] The government has set a deadline for the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency for Gold Yuan Certificates. However, people are concerned about how to handle gold, silver, and foreign currency left in their care by relatives and friends who have left town, or deposited with the court due to lawsuits, which may not have been exchanged on time. The Ministry of Finance's emergency financial and economic measures decree does not yet specify this. Lawyer Xiao Zhenkai previously submitted a telegram to the authorities for clarification based on inquiries from his clients. Now, the Ministry of Finance has issued the following interpretation of the handling method: (1) Gold, silver, and foreign currency deposited with the court due to cases should be immediately applied for by the court to be transferred to the Central Bank for conversion into Gold Yuan Certificates, pending further handling. (2) Regarding gold, silver, and foreign currency held in custody for others, the custodian should immediately notify the depositor to retrieve it. If it has not been retrieved before the expiration of the exchange deadline, the custodian may convert it on their behalf in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code regarding management without mandate.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the issuance of Gold Yuan Certificates, all legal tender, customs gold unit notes, and Northeast circulating notes, regardless of denomination, have been required by the Ministry of Finance to be exchanged for Gold Yuan Certificates by the National Bank before November 20th. In addition to the National Bank and its branches actively handling this exchange, it has also entrusted the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, Postal Remittances Bureau of China, China Trust Company, Central Cooperative Treasury, provincial banks, and the Yunnan Provincial Cooperative Treasury to conduct the exchange. For border areas and remote counties, the Postal Remittances Bureau will instruct post offices or post office agencies to handle the exchange. With the deadline approaching, the National Bank has notified its branches and other exchange agencies to actively conduct the exchange in order to complete it on time.

One-Cent Copper Coins Swept Away in a Rush

National Bank Temporarily Suspends Exchange

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the Central Bank began exchanging one-cent copper coins, citizens have queued up to exchange them in unprecedented crowds. However, the mint only produces 300,000 coins per day, and the original supply of over 3 million coins to the National Bank has been swept away by the crowds seeking to exchange them. Therefore, the bank suspended the exchange yesterday. It will resume when more coins arrive. Regarding rumors of people collecting copper coins at high prices, the Issuance Bureau of the National Bank has reported its findings to the Ministry of Finance for handling. Furthermore, Wei Zengfu, the director of the Central Mint, also went to Beijing a few days ago, reportedly to seek instructions from the authorities regarding the mint's supply situation.

Yesterday afternoon, representatives from the Youth Counseling Committee of the Ministry of Education and the Shandong Provincial Education Department met at the Municipal Education Bureau to discuss handling methods. Due to insufficient preparation of cooking utensils and other items, it was decided to postpone the move for another four or five days.

The refugee students originally received one meal of plain porridge a day from the Municipal Relief Committee, which was not enough to satisfy their hunger. Starting yesterday, the Red Swastika Society took over responsibility for meals, providing two meals of porridge a day at 8:00 AM and 3:00 PM.

The Tight Credit Situation Is Worsening, the Underground Interbank Lending Market Is Active

Yesterday, "the underground interbank lending market was active, and credit was extremely tight due to a large amount of floating capital flowing to the southwest and Guangzhou." Yesterday, some small and medium-sized banks and financial institutions felt the pressure of tight credit. There were many shortages of funds, with more institutions seeking loans than lending them. Underground interest rates were high, with daily loans of 1,000 yuan at a minimum of 8.5 yuan, and a maximum of 10 yuan, equivalent to over 30% monthly interest. Over-the-counter prices in various industries were very active. Most of those lending funds did so for one or two days.

Another Report: The increasingly tight credit situation in recent days, according to financial figures, is mainly due to the outflow of capital to the south, but also to merchants rushing to replenish their commodity inventories. If merchants truly sell all their goods and do not replenish their inventories, they will inevitably deposit the proceeds into banks, and the credit situation will ease. However, the opposite is true: many banks and financial institutions have more overdrafts.

Another Report: Recently, the panic over cash in this city has become more severe, and immediate checks are prohibited. Bank and financial institution clients must find other ways to balance their accounts on the same day. Therefore, the use of transfer applications has greatly increased in recent days. Ordinary banks and financial institutions use 50 to 60 copies per day, and in some cases, over 100 copies. These transfer applications involve transferring funds from the bank's exchange account with the Central Bank, so they are not included in the check clearing figures.

The Cash Shortage Continues, with Premiums on the Market, Especially for 50 and 100 Yuan Notes

It is said that the Central Bank issues a certain amount of large notes every day, but they have not yet been found on the market. It is widely believed that they have been swept away by cash transporters. It is also said that the premium has reached over 5 yuan per 1,000.

Raw Materials Are Extremely Scarce, China Textile Corporation Reduces Production, Cotton Was Not Available on the Market Yesterday

Due to the shortage of raw materials, the output of cotton yarn at the China Textile Corporation's factories is declining. The current output is mainly used to repay the US Aid Association's yarn debts and there is little capacity to supply the market. Most of the factories currently operating are producing for the Central Bank's sales. Yesterday, a total of four types were offered, totaling 156 pieces, worth 107,523 Gold Yuan. The appraised prices were 255 yuan for 6-count Deputy Sunlight, 480 yuan for 10-count Deputy Blue Phoenix, 568 yuan for 14-count Water Moon, and 700 yuan for 20-count Tianguan.

Cotton Cloth Businesses Shorten Operating Hours

Cotton cloth retail stores have become targets of panic buying in recent days. From morning to night, customers are constantly at the door, causing staff to be tense and exhausted. Some have even fallen ill. Yesterday, members of the association sent a letter to the association, explaining the situation and requesting the association to find a way to improve the operating hours of the retail stores. The association believes that this situation will have a great impact on cotton cloth merchants. If no remedy is found, they will all face closure. The association's board of directors recently resolved to shorten daily operating hours by one hour, changing them from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, with one day off on Sundays. The association has notified all members to comply.

No Cotton Transactions

There were still no cotton transactions yesterday. Cotton merchants in this city are still watching the trend. New cotton has been on the market for a long time, but most cotton merchants are still not planning to purchase it immediately, and the market remains quiet.

Cement Industry Suggests Adopting Soft Chain Method to Improve Quality

China's cement standards have been tested in the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and France before the war. Not only are they not inferior to any foreign goods, but their performance even surpasses that of British and American products. After the war, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Central Standards Bureau, in order to improve the quality of domestic cement and meet the sales needs at home and abroad, has drafted standards and sent them to the National Cement Industry Association for comments. Cement experts Wang Tao, Xu Zongdong, and Lu Zongxian provided suggestions that, in order to make China's cement comparable to cement from any country in the world, the soft chain method should be used for testing, and fixed and fineness standards should be set, as well as raising the standards for fineness and tensile strength. The impact of sand on cement strength is very significant and should also be clearly stipulated. It is understood that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has adopted the above-mentioned suggestions and included them in the original plan for discussion and approval, which will be implemented soon.

Woolen Fabric Inventory Registration Completed, Allocation Methods Still Awaiting Approval

It will soon be allocated to the Shanghai Woolen Fabric Business Association, which will then be re-allocated to woolen fabric stores in this city.

100,000 *Dan* of Rice from Wuxi Starts Transporting to Shanghai

In order to enrich the city's food supply, the supervisor purchased 100,000 *dan* of rice from Wuxi and other producing areas a decade ago. All of this rice has been purchased and has begun to be transported to Shanghai, which can be transported within three days. After this rice arrives in Shanghai, most of it will be used for allocation, and part of it will be sold in stores.

Another Report: Recently, rice merchants in the producing areas of Wuxi, Dangshu, Pinghu, Zhoupu, Jiaxing, and Wuhu have had a lot of difficulties from local governments when handling purchase certificates from the Shanghai District Supervision Office to purchase rice. Already purchased rice, amounting to about 20,000 *shi*, is also not allowed to leave the area. Rice merchants yesterday sent several representatives to the Supervisor's Office to report on the situation and requested the office to send personnel to the above-mentioned producing areas together with the rice merchants to order immediate release.

The Rice Market Is Still Not Open

Rice arrivals are still not flourishing. The Nanshi market has 605 *shi* and the Beishi market has 514 *shi*. The two markets total 1,149 *shi*. Although there are price quotes in the market, there are no transactions. The number of people in the market is decreasing day by day. The queues at rice shops are growing longer, with each person buying five *sheng* upon presentation of their identity card.

Sugar Supply and Demand Stagnates

There were still no transactions in the sugar market yesterday. License holders are watching the future situation quietly.

Banks and Financial Institutions May Be Allowed to Use Cash Deposits for Legitimate Purposes

The Tea Market Is Still Active

Yesterday, from morning to closing, the buying interest in red and green tea varieties was still strong. However, due to the scarcity of goods in the producing areas and the high prices, the supply is becoming increasingly uncertain, and transactions are lacking in reality. According to authoritative figures in China's tea export industry, since the sellers have been reluctant to sell cheaply, domestic tea prices have recently been close to foreign tea prices. However, if China's tea continues to prosper in the future, it will be in an upside-down state. Looking at this situation, exports may not be optimistic.

Cigarette Market Suspends Trading

The cigarette market was informed by the Shanghai District Economic Supervision Office that the cigarette market affiliated to the industry association had no goods for exchange and was ordered to temporarily suspend operations. Therefore, the market has entered a state of stillness. Although some traders came to the market yesterday morning, they soon dispersed. The daily necessities soap and candle market affiliated to the industry has also been suspended.

Another Report: The authorities' regulation that members of the cigarette industry association who joined after "August 19" will no longer be eligible for allocation has caused dissatisfaction among the industry. Yesterday morning, representatives of the industry asked the association for the right to be allocated goods.

### Attempt to Disrupt Finances Has International Background; Police Squad Successfully Cracks Two Cases; Shen Wenjie, One of the "Four Heavenly Kings," Arrested Again on Another Charge

[Our Report] Since its establishment, the Police Bureau's Economic Police Brigade's Gold and Currency Investigation Team successfully cracked three major black market gold and currency cases in rapid succession within sixteen hours, from 8:00 AM on the 27th to 12:00 PM on the 28th of this month. Among these, two cases involved attempts to undermine the credibility of the Gold Yuan currency by exploiting international connections, with the aim of creating a black market for gold and currency, thereby causing runaway inflation and plunging people's lives into despair. The other case involved Shen Wenjie, one of the "Four Heavenly Kings" of the black market gold and currency trade, who had previously been arrested and released on bail by the District Prosecutor's Office. Although no transaction was taking place at the scene, he was arrested due to significant suspicion. After thorough interrogation by the team, all three cases have been concluded and will be transferred to the Special Criminal Court for legal action. The details of the successful investigations are as follows: (1) A British expatriate (currently at large) was recently entrusted by a foreign bank to purchase a large quantity of US dollars at high black market prices. The expatriate then entrusted Wang Chengzhi, the manager of the American Pacific Enterprise Company at 9 Zhongshan East Road, third floor, in this city, to handle the matter. After Wang searched everywhere, he became acquainted with an American expatriate. The Economic Police Brigade became aware of this American expatriate and dispatched personnel to contact him. On the 27th of this month, the American expatriate pretended to call Wang, claiming to have US$3,500 willing to sell at a price of seven Gold Yuan to one US dollar, and scheduled a transaction for 8:00 PM that evening. Wang, unaware of the ruse, was quite pleased. At the appointed time, the team first dispatched team leader Wang Enzu, deputy team leader Chen Jingxing, Tao Genrong, and Chinese and foreign officers to the vicinity of Wang Chengzhi's office on the Bund to make arrangements. At the same time, squad leader Fan Mingxin was dispatched to accompany the American expatriate, carrying the US dollars, to arrive on time. Unexpectedly, Wang was also exceptionally vigilant, saying that the Gold Yuan currency was not in the office and asked the American expatriate to accompany him to his home. He then immediately called a taxi and drove them to 16, Lane 506, Jianguo West Road. At this time, the pre-arranged police officers saw that the plan was not proceeding as expected, so they also followed in a car. After arriving at Wang's residence, Wang went upstairs and brought down 25,000 Gold Yuan. After both parties counted the money, Wang suddenly said that it was very inconvenient to store the US dollars at home, and put the US dollars in the lining of his coat. He then hired a car to take them to his relative's house on Xiangyang Road. Upon arriving at Xiangyang Road, squad leader Fan showed his identification, and the accompanying personnel also stepped forward to take Wang and the American expatriate into custody. After being arrested, Wang, knowing that there was no way to deny it, confessed directly. Yesterday, based on his confession, the team also arrested a fellow accomplice, Yang Shounian, in a hospital. The British expatriate who is at large is still being pursued. Wang is a graduate of Harvard University and West Point Military Academy in the United States and was sent by the American Pacific Enterprise headquarters to Shanghai several months ago to take up the position of manager of the branch office.

Soviet Expatriate Entrusted to Purchase US Dollars at High Prices

(2) A Soviet citizen, Li Wenzhuofu (B. Liventzoff), residing at 5 Cangzhou Villa, Jing'an Temple Road, was recently entrusted by a certain party to purchase US dollars at high black market prices in the same manner, attempting to disrupt the financial system. The Economic Police Brigade became aware of this and, using a strategy to their advantage, secretly dispatched foreign officers to negotiate, agreeing to a price of nine and a half Gold Yuan per US dollar for US$4,600. Li believed it to be true and carried a suitcase containing over 43,700 Gold Yuan and accompanied them in a car to an apartment near Hengshan Road and Gaoen Road, which had been pre-arranged by the police. At that time, the foreign police officer went upstairs to retrieve the US$4,600 and returned to the car. Just as the transaction was taking place, the pre-arranged police officers rushed out and arrested Li. Knowing that the matter had been exposed, Li still tried to resist and attempted to snatch back the cash that was about to be paid, but was stopped by the police. After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, he also confessed directly, but refused to reveal the names of his principals. Yesterday, the police went to his residence for a search but found nothing. It was found that the place was the private residence of his brother-in-law (a Dutchman). According to the people in the house, they never inquired about his whereabouts, but recently they often saw him carrying large amounts of Gold Yuan in and out.

Mishandeling & Co. Third Floor Has a Secret Room

(3) Shen Wenjie, the former manager of Mishandeling Cloth Company at 58 Tianjin Road, second floor, was found by the Economic Police Brigade on June 14th of this year to be engaged in black market gold and currency trading, and three ten-tael gold bars, over one hundred million yuan in cash, and draft account receipts were confiscated. After being sent to the District Prosecutor's Office, he was soon released on bail. Recently, Shen resumed his illegal activity and continued to secretly engage in black market gold and currency trading. After receiving a report, the Economic Police Brigade dispatched team leader Wang Enzu and officers to search the premises on the morning of the 28th. Although no trading activity was found at the scene, in his secret room on the third floor and inside the hidden compartments of the floor, walls, and seats, they found checks from Yifeng Qianzhuang and account books with transaction figures of over ten thousand Gold Yuan. In addition to photographing all the evidence, Shen and related suspects Ye Xinghua, Zhang Yinzhi, Cheng Yingchu, and other four people were taken to the bureau for detention and interrogation.

Chiang then immediately summoned Wang Zishuang, the deputy director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, to study the technical issues of opening up industrial loans in order to solve the difficulties in industrial production in this city.

### Difficulty in Procuring Pork; Increase in Fresh Fish Supply

[Our Report] In order to strengthen the management of small vegetable markets, the economic control authorities previously instructed the police bureau to establish a special agency to manage the supply and prices of fresh meat, vegetables, and fish. Recently, after consultation among the responsible personnel, it was decided that the prices of fresh meat and vegetables will be maintained at the "August 19th" market price before the implementation of negotiated pricing. To increase supply, each pork merchant has been instructed to purchase fresh pork from northern Jiangsu. However, because the price of pork in the producing areas is higher than in Shanghai, the authorities, taking the facts into consideration, have also reached an agreement with the Fisheries Management Office that fish will be substituted for meat when necessary, and starting from today, the office will increase the supply of fresh fish to the fish markets by 50,000 catties per day to meet the needs of the market.

### Shipments of Fresh Fish to Shanghai Intercepted; Social Affairs Bureau Requests Permission for Passage

[Our Report] The Municipal Fishery Association, the Fish Business Association, the Fresh Fish Business Association, the Fishing Vessel Association, the Seafood Transportation and Marketing Federation, the Fishmongers' Association, and other organizations jointly submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating that the supply of fresh fish in this city relies on the outer sea and the inland rivers of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Recently, due to the fact that the local governments do not understand the actual supply and demand situation, they arbitrarily intercept fish and seafood passing through their territories, especially in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Hai'ning, Linping, Jiading, Qingpu, and other places, resulting in a daily decrease in the arrival of fish and seafood in this city. They requested that the sources of supply be unblocked. After receiving the document, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately sent a telegram to the Construction Departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, instructing the subordinate cities and counties to allow the passage of fish and seafood passing through their territories in order to increase the supply to this city.
