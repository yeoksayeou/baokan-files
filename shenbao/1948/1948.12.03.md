### Successful Annihilation Battle Between Suxian and Guzhen: Bandit Army in Full Retreat Across the Fei River; Northern-Advancing National Army Captures Cao Lao Ji in One Stroke

[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 2nd] The 55th and 68th Armies on the right flank facing Bengbu annihilated the bandits attempting to cross the Fei River last night on the south bank. This morning at dawn, they crossed the river in pursuit and routed a portion of Chen bandit's 13th Column near Huangzhuang on the north bank. They are continuing their northward advance.

[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 2nd] The bag-shaped encirclement of the remnant bandits in the Bengbu-Suxian area is tightening. The Qiu and Sun Corps moving south have reached the Jiagou area. The Huang Wei Corps on the west side captured Shuangduiji yesterday and continued to capture Dayingji (over 40 li north of Suxian) on the south bank of the Hui River today. Military sources predict that they will join forces with the southward-moving corps within days. The Chen bandits' 2nd, 6th, 11th, and 12th Columns, which were drawn into the area between the Xie River and the North Fei River facing Bengbu by the National Army, have suffered heavy losses in recent days and are under great pressure from the National Army's pincer attack from the north and south. They have gradually moved north. The elite troops on the left and right wings of Bengbu, who had been waiting for action, crossed the North Fei River today in pursuit and advanced north along the railway. One unit, with the cooperation of the air force, defeated the bandit army's stubborn resistance near Cao Lao Ji last night and captured the area in one stroke this morning, and continued to advance northward. The results on all fronts are extremely brilliant, and many bandits were killed by air force strafing and bombing.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Military news: The annihilation battle between Suxian and Guzhen is proceeding extremely smoothly. The powerful corps of the National Army moving south from Xuzhou, under the personal command of Du Yuming, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, has defeated the 3rd and 6th Guangxi Columns of Chen Yi's bandit troops and is advancing towards Suxian with overwhelming superiority. According to Deng Wenyi, spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, it is estimated that the National Army can achieve a decisive victory in the Sugu area within five days.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Military news: In the annihilation battle in the Subeng area, the main force of Chen Yi's bandit troops, twelve columns, were concentrated in a hammer-shaped formation between Suxian and Guzhen. Under the pincer attack of the National Army's powerful corps from the north and south, the bandits who had been harassing Cao Lao Ji and Xin Ma Bridge between the Hui River and the Fei River south of Guzhen were severely attacked by our Liu Ruming Corps on the evening of the first day and fled in panic across the Fei River to the north, attempting to escape the battlefield and avoid annihilation. According to captured bandit documents, the bandit leaders ordered the bandits to flee north at a rate of 100 li per day, day and night. The National Army is pursuing them north.

[United Press, Nanjing, 2nd] According to a long-distance telephone call received here at 11:15 a.m. from Zhazibu: The main force of the Communist army, 100,000 strong around Bengbu, crossed the Fei River on the morning of the 2nd and made a full retreat to the north to reinforce Suxian. The threat to Bengbu can now be considered to be relieved for some time. It is reported that the Sun Yuanliang, Qiu Qingquan, and Li Mi Corps have broken through the Communist army's interception in Jiagou and are attacking the Communist-held area from the north, west, and east. It is generally believed that this southward attack by the National Army, which has stopped the Communist army's offensive against Nanjing, is the first strategic success of the National Army in the recent war. (Another dispatch) Deng Wenyi, spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, confirmed on the 2nd that the Communist army had made a full retreat across the Fei River north of Bengbu.

[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 2nd] Hu Lian, Deputy Commander of the 12th Corps and Commander of the 18th Army, after listening to the President's instructions in Nanjing, flew by special plane this afternoon via Bengbu to the front line of the department's position in Mengcheng to command the operations.

### Deng Wenyi Denies Xuzhou Retreat; Du Yuming's Headquarters Still in Xu

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 2nd] Deng Wenyi, spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, stated at a reception on the 2nd in response to reporters' inquiries: (1) Liu Bocheng's troops on both sides of the Hui River consist of seven columns, numbered 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 9th, and 11th, totaling about 130,000 to 140,000 men. Chen Yi's troops near Guzhen consist of four columns, numbered 1st, 2nd, 11th, and 12th, but actually less than three columns, about 40,000 men. Those blocking our Xuzhou army's southward advance south of Xuzhou are the 3rd, 16th, and two Guangxi units of the bandits, and parts of the 4th, 9th, and Rapid Columns. East of Xuzhou are the 7th and New 8th Columns of the bandits. (2) Since the beginning of the Xuzhou campaign, nearly 10,000 bandits have been captured. Deng also denied rumors of a retreat from Xuzhou. He said that as of the 2nd, there had been no retreat from Xuzhou, and whether there would be a retreat in the future would depend on the outcome of the Bengbu-Suhui campaign. The closure of the airport and communications was based on other reasons and could not be taken as evidence of a retreat. Deng also said that General Du Yuming was currently commanding operations between the front line and Xuzhou, and his headquarters were still in Xuzhou. Deng added that General Huang Botao had not been in contact with the National Army since the Nianzhuang battle. Huang's unit consisted of only four armies, about 60,000 men. About 30,000 men were killed and about 20,000 were wounded in the Nianzhuang battle, and more than 10,000 men had broken through and reached Xuzhou. Three of Huang's four army commanders had escaped, and only one was missing.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Deng Wenyi told reporters at a press conference on the 2nd that rumors that Lin Biao's bandit troops in the Northeast were attempting to cross the Bohai Sea and land in Shandong were completely unfounded. Given the current situation, it was absolutely impossible for the bandits to cross the Bohai Sea. (The full text of the "Weekly War Situation" released by the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense is published on page two.)

### Fu Zuoyi Flies to Zhangjiakou to Deploy Military Affairs; Major Battle Resumes in the Eastern Section of the PingSui Railway; National Army's Eastward-Advancing Corps Recovers Shalingzi

[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 2nd] Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi flew from Ping to this location by plane around 12:00 noon on the 2nd, and flew back to Ping at 4:15 p.m., stopping here for three hours, during which he made perfect plans for the Zhangyuan outer perimeter battle. Fu expressed deep satisfaction with the recent major victory on the outskirts of Zhangyuan, and also expressed his firm belief in the upcoming annihilation battle on the outskirts of Zhangyuan.

[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 2nd] The major battle in the eastern section of the Pingsui Railway, which ended in February, resumed on the evening of the first day. The bandit's New 7th and 8th Divisions and the 1st Column, in an attempt to reverse the declining situation on the outskirts of Zhangyuan, launched repeated fierce assaults on strongholds in the eastern section of the Pingsui Railway and Shalingzi (20 li east of Zhangtan) on the outskirts of Zhangyuan, using human-wave tactics starting on the evening of the first day. The battle was extremely fierce. Our army in Shalingzi entered favorable terrain. A portion of the bandit's New 8th Division, which attacked Xinbao'an about 70 kilometers southeast of Zhangyuan, launched more than ten fierce attacks around 12:00 p.m. on the first day, but were all repelled by the combined efforts of the defending troops and the reinforcements, and the bandits scattered and fled, leaving behind many corpses.

[Another dispatch] The National Army's eastward-advancing corps recovered the stronghold of Shalingzi, 20 li east of Zhangyuan, at 11:00 a.m. on the 2nd. Also, the PingZhang Railway was blocked again on the 2nd, and most of the tracks between Shalingzi and Langshan (west of Xiahuayuan) were destroyed by bandits.

### Leader of the Diplomatic Corps, Merrillees, Claims: All Ambassadors and Ministers Remain in Beijing; Facilitation for Family Members of Embassy Staff to Reside Elsewhere

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 2nd] The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on the 2nd: We have declared to the envoys of various countries stationed in Beijing that our government has no intention of selecting a capital city. The leader of the diplomatic corps stationed in Beijing, Ambassador Merrillees, has stated to this ministry that the heads of the embassies of various countries (ambassadors and ministers) are representatives sent by the heads of their countries to the head of China, therefore, the heads of embassies of various countries in Beijing mostly believe that they should reside in Nanjing with the head of our country. As for members or family members of the embassies, if they wish to temporarily reside elsewhere due to the war, we will facilitate this and they may choose their own location. At the same time, our government will also equip hostels in places further from the war zone that have modern facilities for their use.

### Ambassador Gu Urges US-China to Establish a Common Front

[United Press, New York, 2nd] Chinese Ambassador Gu said on the 2nd that China is acting as a vanguard in Asia to stem communism, just as the US is engaged in a cold war in Europe to stem threats to the American way of life and the free world. Gu urged the US and China to establish a common front against international communism. He continued: "China would welcome any suggestions for improving current practices and, to the extent possible, make these practices more resistant to corruption."

[Associated Press, New York, 1st] Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun delivered a speech at the China Institute in Washington, D.C., urging the US to provide timely assistance to China. Gu said: If China falls behind the Iron Curtain, all of Asia will lose its freedom, and the US, as the leader of freedom, will bear heavier responsibilities. The current situation is serious, and time is a critical factor, it may be a little late, but not too late.

[Another dispatch] Ambassador Gu said that some people in China, especially in the Legislative Yuan, are advocating that the Chinese civil war be regarded as a "threat to peace" under the UN Charter and be submitted to the UN for resolution.

### Connally Broadcasts Nationwide: Favors Sending MacArthur to China; Judd and Others Urge Increased Assistance

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee of the Democratic Party, broadcasted nationwide on the evening of the 1st, saying that he personally favored sending MacArthur to China as an advisor to direct the military operations of the National Army. He pointed out that if Madame Chiang could influence public opinion to favor China, the American people might accept the idea of increasing aid to China.

[United Press, Washington, 1st] Former Senator Clark said on the 1st that he agreed with the view of Chinese leaders in Nanjing that a talented military leader (such as General MacArthur) should be appointed as the supreme military advisor to the National Army. Given MacArthur's prestige in the Far East and his military genius, he is the most suitable candidate for this position. He believes that this appointment would be a good thing.

[Central News Agency, New York, 1st] Republican Congressman Judd of the United States said that if the United States does not immediately provide strong aid to China, China will be ruled by the Communist Party. Judd warned during a speech at the American Industrial Association that if China turns red, the Soviet Union will have a vassal state on its Asian front that is as solid as a rock and will not need to fight on two fronts, and can be in a more advantageous position to seize more European countries. Judd said that if China belongs to the Soviet Union and possesses the resources of other countries in East Asia, the balance of world resources will favor the Soviet Union, and the United States will be impoverished to death. Judd believes that the serious situation in China is due to the United States' refusal to believe in the conspiracy of the Chinese Communist Party in time, just like the Communist conspiracy in other places. Judd demanded that the United States not only provide economic and military assistance to China, but also strengthen its political and ideological forces.

[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] Republican Congressman Merrow, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that the United States should immediately increase aid to China, even if it leads to a US-Soviet war. If the Soviet Union opposes, we would rather "show our cards" now. When the new Congress convenes, he will propose to allocate $1 billion for military aid to China, and will also propose that the United States send the military advisors that President Chiang needs. The funds needed under the European Recovery Program should be reduced to prevent Asia from falling.

### Madame Chiang's Statement in Washington: Thanks for American Concern and Sympathy

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] Due to Madame Chiang's arrival in the United States, the China issue will become the topic of President Truman's press conference to be held on the afternoon of the 2nd. The President will inevitably be asked about the crisis in China, whether he will invite Madame Chiang to the White House, and the details of his reply to President Chiang's letter requesting assistance.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 1st] Madame Chiang made her first public statement in Leesburg, Virginia, the hometown of Secretary of State Marshall and his wife, expressing her gratitude for the concern and sympathy of "American friends" for China. Deputy Secretary of State Lovett said today that the State Department had not yet received a request for a meeting with Madame Chiang, and the White House also said that it had not received a request for a meeting with the President.

[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] Hours after Madame Chiang arrived at Marshall's family estate, she allowed reporters to take photos on the lawn. During the photo session, Madame Chiang turned to Mrs. Marshall and said, "Today is my wedding anniversary." Mrs. Marshall replied, "Congratulations." Madame Chiang said, "Being in this situation is enough of a celebration."

### President Chiang Receives Vaughan: Confident that the War Situation Will Turn in Favor of the National Army

[United Press, Nanjing, 1st] Hugh Baillie, Deputy Chairman and General Manager of United Press, wrote the following after meeting with President Chiang:

I met with President Chiang for a long time on the afternoon of the 1st and felt that the President was full of energy and clearly had confidence that the military situation would turn in favor of the National Army. This trip was a private visit of an old friend and had no journalistic component, as the President believes that it is not appropriate to issue news statements at this time. It is certainly no secret that President Chiang believes that China urgently needs American aid, but he does not intend to start any campaign in the press to emphasize China's difficulties.

After arriving in Nanjing from Shanghai, I immediately sent a letter requesting an audience with President Chiang to discuss the current situation. The President replied immediately, saying that he welcomed a "friendly visit." We then drove to the President's residence at the Ministry of National Defense, which was closely guarded but not very strict. We were stopped three times. Each time we were asked who was visiting, and the official accompanying me, Shi Zhaolong, replied, "Hugh Baillie of United Press." The guard checked the list of visitors and then let us through. When we arrived at the President's residence, Navy Colonel Shen Shaolin (transliteration), the President's aide, came to meet us. Colonel Shen had met me once before and he led me to the President's study. The study was very large, but only a small electric stove was lit. There was a fireplace at one end of the study, above which hung a large portrait of Sun Yat-sen. Four masterpieces by the famous painter Qi Baishi hung on the four walls. The study was furnished with only a set of sofas and a few tables and chairs. At the other end of the study hung a painting presented by the Chinese Medical Association on the occasion of the President's 59th birthday.

Strong and Unified is Believable

President Chiang entered the room promptly at the pre-arranged time, greeted me with delight, and inquired about the well-being of many friends. The President was wearing a grassy green Zhongshan suit with a yellow belt, without any medals, and black leather shoes. His health was very good, his complexion was good, his eyes were bright, and his demeanor was calm and resolute. The President sat comfortably in a chair, with his hands crossed on his lap, and sometimes tapped the floor lightly with his right foot when emphasizing a point.

I had been told that the President absolutely believed that he was still destined to see a strong and unified China in the end. The President now clearly confirmed this. The President expressed regret that his views on the current situation could not be directly quoted, but said that he thought it would be inappropriate for him to conduct a public campaign to influence public opinion in the United States or elsewhere.

Before meeting with the President, I had lengthy conversations with almost all the important figures in Nanjing and heard many of their explanations. The following must be regarded as purely my personal report summarizing the views of the Chinese people, as I have personally or directed United Press to cover every action of the Chinese National Revolution since 1924.

Foxconn Staying in Jiangnan Indefinitely

(1) The current situation is probably the most serious that the new China has ever faced, even more serious than the Japanese invasion of China, because the current "aggressors" are Chinese and will not encounter the same difficulties that the Japanese encountered in consolidating their conquest.

But China's top leaders are not discouraged and will continue to fight, just as they continued to resist the Japanese when everything seemed to be lost. They can hold the area south of the Yangtze River indefinitely, but they admit that American ammunition and other supplies are needed quickly and urgently. They do not want American troops to come to China, but they do need ammunition from the nearest American supply base in the Pacific.

Welcome to Send MacArthur to China

(2) China would welcome the appointment of MacArthur or some other American military leader as the supreme military advisor, and is certainly prepared to give full cooperation. Most people in China believe that MacArthur is the ideal person to stop the spread of communism in China and throughout Asia, because MacArthur has extensive experience in Asia and enjoys a very high reputation in all Asian countries. As one well-informed source put it, "Simply announcing that MacArthur has been appointed would change the Chinese war."

(3) What the Chinese people want to know now is whether Washington is prepared to provide additional assistance, and if so, what are the conditions? They are prepared to agree to almost any condition.

(4) The Chinese people believe that they are fighting to save all of Asia, not just China, and they also believe that the United States should demand that Washington take action now for its own benefit. If the Communist Party consolidates its control over Asia and cooperates with the Soviet Union, while the United States is pouring its main forces into saving Europe, then Asia will break away from the democratic world indefinitely—or at least until the United States defeats the Soviet bloc in a new world war.

Asian Marshall Plan

(5) The most progressive Chinese people would welcome an "Asian Marshall Plan" and a comprehensive American policy towards all Asian countries. Under this plan, aid to China would be designed and allocated only as part of an overall plan to aid all Asian countries (including Japan). Therefore, they believe that MacArthur has completed a "great achievement" in Japan and has demonstrated the administrative capacity "necessary for the reconstruction of all Asia." They solemnly pointed out that the Chinese people do not want the United States to bankrupt itself in order to aid China and Asia. They believe that the amount of aid should be comparatively less than what has already been given to Britain and allocated to European recovery.

Full of Courage and Perseverance

(6) The greatest danger faced by the government is also the Communist Party's propaganda, exaggerating the government's failures, exaggerating victories that never happened, trying to increase defeatism south of the Yangtze River, and saying that because of the lack of confidence in the government's strength, all foreigners are withdrawing. In my conversations with China's top leaders, I was deeply impressed by their courage and perseverance. They all seemed to be convinced that there would be some way to stop the Communist Party north of the Yangtze River and save Nanjing.

### Legislative Yuan "New Deal Club" Issues Seven Political Propositions: Hoping to Form a Responsible Cabinet Full of Reform

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 2nd] The New Deal Club, organized by a group of legislators, issued the following recent political propositions on the 2nd:

(1) Organize a strong and effective responsible cabinet that is united nationwide and full of reform. A, The Executive Yuan should recruit democratic and progressive people from both inside and outside the party to participate. B, To promote new policies and use new people, the members of the Executive Yuan's various departments should be appointed with clean, hardworking people who have confidence and perseverance in reform. (2) Call on the whole people to unite and suppress the rebellion. For those in the country who have differences with the government other than the Communist Party, the government should find ways to communicate and coordinate in order to concentrate its efforts to save the crisis. (3) The Communist Party is an international aggressive group. The government should cooperate closely with democratic allies in military and financial matters, and accept their well-intentioned suggestions in order to achieve coordinated and consistent results. (4) In wartime finance, in addition to property taxes, the government should use effective methods to make the wealthy and powerful pay, and should especially expedite negotiations to use the funds of Chinese people abroad. We oppose relying solely on inflating the currency to make up for the deficit in the budget. In terms of cost-cutting, the government should effectively cut down on bureaucracy and eliminate waste. (5) The treatment of officers, soldiers, and public educators should be effectively improved to ensure that they can maintain the necessary standard of living. Combat troops should be treated even better. (6) Local governments should recruit more young cadres to participate and take on real responsibilities. (7) Mobilize the national manpower to participate in the rebellion suppression work. The government should support fair and patriotic leaders in various localities and organize people's self-defense forces so that they can fully take responsibility for guarding the localities and reduce the burden on the national army.

Editorial

### Grain Storage Campaign and Grain Management Regulations

The Ministry of Food, regarding Central and Southern China, is said to be taking emergency measures concerning the people's food supply, one of which is that cities lacking grain should immediately launch a grain storage campaign. This is a very meaningful and important matter.

Recalling the severity of the grain shortage situation in various places half a month ago, and the various chaotic situations that arose directly and indirectly, no one would deny the importance of the grain storage issue. Moreover, being prepared is worry-free. Accumulating grain to prevent famine has always been a consistent policy throughout the dynasties; some counties still have a small number of charitable granaries or grain storage facilities left, which can be said to be the remaining benefits of good governance in previous eras.

However, the number of such remaining warehouses is too small after all. Although the responsible departments have repeatedly urged and set deadlines for implementation before and after the war against Japan, most of the former warehouses have been destroyed or repurposed, and the funds for reconstruction and grain accumulation are not easy to raise. Not to mention other places, just take Shanghai as an example, this important policy has not been able to be prepared until now. Some places, although they have acted according to the old practice, barely purchased and stored thousands of piculs of grain, or changed the accumulation of grain to the accumulation of funds due to the lack of storage space. However, this is a drop in the bucket, and the amount is small, so it cannot actually have the effect of preventing famine. Someone has told several stories: (1) The grain accumulation funds levied in a certain county were originally not much, but the warehouse committee used them here and there, and most of them were used as administrative expenses. After several years, they finally could not accumulate a single grain; (2) A certain county once stored a batch of grain. During the season when the grain should be dried, the budget for this item was repeatedly rejected by the provincial and county authorities. By the time the decision was finalized, the grain had already sprouted; (3) Certain counties, due to special reasons for growing grain, transferred all the accumulated grain and funds to other uses. Therefore, to follow the old path of grain accumulation and restore or expand the granaries in various places as a genuine means of preparing for famine is probably too far from ideal.

I remember that in May of this year, the authorities had planned to set up Ever-Normal Granaries, preparing to establish them separately in places such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuxi, and Wuhu in the Yangtze River basin, and start work after the autumn harvest. In July, when the Minister of Food received newspaper reporters, he also explained this plan in detail, planning to establish purchasing and storage warehouses in areas with abundant grain production, supply warehouses in major consumer cities, and transfer warehouses in collection and distribution markets or transportation centers, all as part of the Ever-Normal Granaries. These are all national grain storage plans. However, how it is progressing, we have not seen detailed reports until now. It can be seen that if the government alone is to bear the responsibility for grain storage, at least it is probably like trying to put out a fire with water from afar.

Since the government cannot bear this burden alone, the people have to share the responsibility. According to the people's grain storage, there are generally the following three categories:

(1) Grain Merchants: According to the provisions of the Regulations on the Management of Grain, when grain merchants buy and sell grain, they should handle matters such as (1) region, (2) time limit, (3) quantity, and (4) price in accordance with the regulations of the competent authorities, and must register or report at any time. Violators will be punished separately. Those who accumulate 200 piculs or more but less than 500 piculs of grain, or 100 piculs or more but less than 300 piculs of wheat, shall be convicted of hoarding and profiteering, and sentenced to imprisonment for six months or more but less than one year, and all of their grain shall be confiscated. According to this regulation, who would dare to store grain for supply? Fortunately, local officials relied on the actual situation and did not strictly enforce these provisions. Otherwise, some of the retailers and most of the wholesalers would probably be subjected to imprisonment and confiscation, and the supply of people's food would only rely on official rice and foreign rice for relief!

(2) Grain Households: That is, the farmers who produce grain. In addition to the accumulated grain that should be paid, the seeds that should be stored, and the grain for their own use that should be kept until the next grain harvest, according to the law, the rest should be regarded as surplus grain, and they are not allowed to accumulate it without authorization. Those who do so will be deemed to be hoarding and profiteering. It can be seen that farmers now have absolutely no qualification to store grain. What the ancients called: "If you cultivate for three years, you will have food for one year; if you cultivate for nine years, you will have food for three years" has become nonsense under the modern grain storage campaign.

(3) Civilian Households: According to the law, they are only allowed to store three months' worth of grain for their own consumption, and public and private institutions and organizations are only allowed to store two months' worth of grain for their own consumption. Those who exceed this amount should report to the local grain authority for approval, and violators will be confiscated. According to this regulation, ordinary civilian households and public and private institutions and organizations really have no possibility of participating in this grain storage campaign.

Originally, the above regulations were formulated during the period of intensified management. At that time, the only goal of the authorities was to crack down on hoarding and enforce price limits, and everything else was secondary. At that time, there had not been a panic buying craze and grain shortage phenomenon, so they naturally did not know the severity of the people's food problem and the importance of grain storage for famine prevention. Now that things have changed and the situation has changed greatly, and the general focus has shifted from simple crackdowns to active famine prevention, it seems that all laws and regulations related to this matter should be revised or abolished as soon as possible in response to the current situation, so as to cooperate with this new campaign. Otherwise, if the laws and regulations restrict it, but the policy wants to encourage storage, it would be like tying one's own hands and feet, and going in the opposite direction.

The so-called Regulations on Punishing Crimes Against Grain Management evolved from the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Crimes Against Grain Management in Extraordinary Times. Although its content is stricter than before, in order to conform to the economic policies of that time, the restrictions are too tight and there are too many obstacles. Even at that time, it was not really implemented smoothly. For example, the item that civilians should not store more than three months' worth of grain is something that everyone knows is impossible to strictly enforce in practice. Because "food is the most important thing for the people," the importance of the food problem exceeds all unrealistic laws and regulations. In this period of insufficient grain ration quantities and frequent delays in distribution, unless they are truly poor people who have no food for the next day, everyone understands that accumulating some grain is the safest way to maintain life. Their intention is not to hoard and profiteer, nor to resell for profit, nor is it about maintaining currency value. Moreover, the Tianjin area has already encouraged the public to accumulate grain, and there is no limit on the quantity. When Inspector Jiang Qian was in Wuxi, he realized that the stocks were empty and the people's food was in serious condition, and he also personally allowed grain merchants to store grain, without being subject to the above restrictions. Therefore, this regulation is actually already dead in name, and it can be clearly abolished to avoid hindering the progress of the grain storage campaign. Recently, it was reported that the National Affairs Agency in Hankou had informed the citizens to store enough food for three months each in case of emergency. We believe that rigidly stipulating that it is not allowed to exceed three months is not realistic, and rigidly stipulating that it must be enough for three months is not something that everyone can do. When it is impossible to implement restrictions and impossible to distribute according to the quota, it is better to let everyone freely purchase and store. On July 31, the first item of the revised management method clearly allowed all grains to be traded according to market prices, and freely transported and sold. This Regulation on Punishing Crimes Against Grain Management is obviously inconsistent with the spirit of free transportation and sales, and is even more incompatible with the grain storage campaign advocated by the Ministry of Food. You cannot have both fish and bear's paw. The Ministry of Food should have known what to choose long ago, but now it is letting unrealistic laws and regulations hang in the air. One can see how efficient the government is in handling affairs.

### Telegram to the US Senate and House of Representatives

The original telegram from all members of the Control Yuan to the US Senate and House of Representatives is as follows:

To the US Embassy, ​​transferred to the entire membership of the US Senate and House of Representatives, for public review, the communists, in order to implement their policy of worldwide communization to achieve the ambition of enslaving all mankind, are following in the footsteps of German and Japanese aggression by recklessly invading countries of peace and democracy. The Chinese Communists, being rebels who have acted under the auspices of this invading group, is the eradication of chaos that our country is currently engaged in is essentially an anti-aggression war to safeguard the survival and prosperity of all mankind's countries of peace and democracy. It is not merely the consolidation of our own peace and unification, which can be regarded as a civil war. Our entire nation, in addition to suffering major losses in the War of Resistance Against Japan, must now bear this sacred and arduous task. No matter how difficult the circumstances, it is not something that we factor in. However, if we fear that we are supporting this independently, it is inevitable that we will provide the aggressors with an opportunity to exploit. If China falls, the Far East will become communist, Asia and Europe will change color, and Pan-America will not be able to rest easy. My colleagues in this Yuan come from the common people and have suffered the most from the poison of the Communist Party. We are deeply concerned about the disasters of the world and, on behalf of the suffering compatriots across the country, appeal to your Yuan to respectfully urge your government and people to strengthen aid to China, put out the fierce flames of the Communist Party, and ensure the democratic and free way of life upon which mankind depends for its survival and the permanent peace of the world.

### Luo Binji and Meng Shirong Publicly Indicted in the Capital Special Tribunal

[Special Report from Nanjing, 2nd] Luo Binji (also known as Zhang Junpu), a former member of the Democratic League and a writer from Northeast China, and Meng Shirong (also known as Meng Zaitian, 34 years old, from Zou County, Shandong), another member of the Democratic League, were captured by the Northeast Security Command near Changchun in March of this year and sent to Beijing for custody in the Capital Special Criminal Tribunal. It has been more than two months since then. Because the case involves complicated internal broadcasts and a wide range of people, and the crime occurred in the Northeast, the investigation is quite difficult. The case file alone is more than a foot thick. The prosecutor reviewed the case and conducted an investigation until he filed a public indictment on the 29th of last month. The contents of the indictment were found to be as follows: Luo Binji was friendly with Zhou Jingwen, a member of the Democratic League. During the Political Consultative Conference in Chongqing, he was persuaded by Zhou Jingwen to join the Democratic League. After the victory, he was introduced to Chen Jianzhong, and they agreed to go from Shanghai to Tianjin and then to Changchun, carrying Zhou Jingwen's letters to the armed comrades in the Northeast and to the compatriots. He also agreed to sign the so-called agreement on behalf of him, planning to steal land in the unrecovered areas of the National Army in the Northeast, organize a government, name it the Provisional Northeast People's Autonomous Committee Central Executive Committee, implement administrative orders, and incorporate local forces to establish the Northeast People's Autonomous Garrison Headquarters. Meng Shirong had been a guerrilla in Shandong in 1942. After being injured and unemployed, he met with Chen Jianzhong several times. At first, he mistakenly thought he was a senior official of the Ministry of National Defense. When he learned about his plan with Luo Binji, he also joined the activities. On March 11, 1947, he left Changchun by car and went to Nongan and then to Harbin to negotiate with the Communist Party, and then returned to the Changchun Riot. The Northeast Security Command discovered this and intercepted them on the way. In mid-September, they were sent to Beijing and handed over to the Capital Special Criminal Tribunal for trial. After investigation by the prosecutor, it was believed that they had acted in a way that endangered the country, so they were sentenced in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Emergency Treatment of Rebellion and Article 2, Paragraph 1 and Article 101, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. Public prosecution was filed in accordance with Article 1 of the Special Criminal Procedure Regulation, Article 2 of the Special Criminal Tribunal Trial Regulation, and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### From the Battle of Xuzhou to the Battle of Bengbu: The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense Releases a Weekly War Situation Report

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released the war situation for the week of November 26th to December 1st as follows:

(1) The Battle of Xuzhou Has Come to a Close

In the Battle of Xuzhou last month, the communist bandits, led by Chen Yi, launched a large-scale pincer offensive against the eastern and western flanks of Xuzhou, with Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng providing support, cutting off the traffic on the Jinpu Railway south of Xuzhou, hoping to seize Xuzhou in one fell swoop and strike the main forces of the National Army. In total, the Chen bandits mobilized 19 columns and 3 independent brigades, the Liu bandits mobilized 5 columns, and the Chen Geng bandits mobilized 2 columns, for a total force of no less than 550,000 men, emptying their forces south of the Yellow River. Since the beginning of November, they have advanced on the eastern and western lines of Xuzhou. Unexpectedly, the bandit troops suffered fatal blows one after another in the vicinity of Huangkou, Nianzhuang, Pantang, Black Mountain, and Daxujia. After two weeks of unprecedentedly fierce and bitter fighting, the National Army created brilliant achievements. This battle not only completely shattered the communist bandits' ambition to seize Xuzhou, but also greatly boosted the morale of the National Army. At the same time, it caused the communist bandits to suffer the greatest casualties since the rebellion. Regardless of how the communist propaganda machine repeatedly used its consistent tactics of spreading rumors and fabricating false battle results, in the Battle of Xuzhou, the National Army, at the cost of less than 70,000 casualties, indeed exchanged for more than 200,000 casualties for the communist bandits. This heavy casualty figure accounts for about two-fifths of the communist bandits' forces. This undeniable fact is based on accurate reports from the front-line troops and the confessions of prisoners. Among them, the 10th, 11th, and 12th divisions of Chen's 4th Column, the 16th, 17th, and 18th divisions of the 6th Column, the 19th, 20th, and 21st divisions of the 7th Column, the 25th, 26th, and 27th divisions of the 9th Column, the 28th and 29th divisions of the 10th Column, the 31st, 32nd, and 33rd divisions of the 11th Column, the 35th and 36th brigades of the 12th Column, the 37th, 38th, and 39th divisions of the 13th Column, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th regiments of the Liangguang Column, and the New 8th Column, all suffered losses of more than two-thirds. In particular, Chen's 4th, 6th, 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, and Lianggang columns, among others, were almost completely annihilated. The remaining Chen's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, New 7th, New 9th, New 11th, and Luzhongnan columns were eliminated by more than one-third. The troops of the National Army that directly participated in the decisive battle in the early stage of the battle were only a very small part of the total strength of the Xuzhou battlefield, that is, only Huang Botao's 4th Army Corps, which carried out a decisive battle with the bandit's 9 columns. This fact shows that any army corps of the National Army can defeat the frantic offensive of the communist bandits' ten columns. At present, the remaining 350,000 men of Chen and Liu's bandit troops can hardly have the strength to resist two or more army corps simultaneously to carry out a decisive battle again. Recently, the dilapidated unit designations used by the bandit army to dazzle our side are mostly represented by three or five incomplete regiments, and most of the soldiers are newly recruited militiamen and ordinary people. If the battle continues like this, the communist bandits will suffer irreparable and serious damage. Moreover, large-scale battles are by no means something that the communist bandits, who have no rear supply line, can cope with. Not only can the consumption of weapons and ammunition not be replenished, but the food needed by hundreds of thousands of people every day cannot be supplied.

The bandit army is powerless to seize Xuzhou strategically, and has suffered serious blows tactically. Undoubtedly, the fate of defeat has already been doomed in the overall situation of the battle.

(2) Battle of Suxian

After suffering heavy blows in succession, the Chen bandits not only dared not face Xuzhou squarely, but also appeared exhausted. The eight columns of the Chen bandits that had been broken and dilapidated, except for merging the 4th and 7th columns, and merging the 9th and 13th columns, have mostly retreated to Luzhongnan and northern Jiangsu for reorganization. At present, they can only use the remnants of the 3rd, 4th, 9th, 12th, Luzhongnan, Liangguang, and Bohai columns to stop the southward advance of the Xuzhou army, and use the 2nd, 6th, 11th, and 13th columns to consolidate the Jinpu Line, assisting Liu Bocheng's Battle of Suxian, in an attempt to encircle and attack our Huang Wei Army Corps. The bandit army, led by Liu bandits, blindly fled south, and its tactics were also a completely risky attempt. The powerful army corps of the National Army on the southern front are mostly newly-built troops. Now, the main battle centered on Suxian has gradually unfolded, and the National Army is taking the initiative to adopt an all-out offensive. Chen and Liu are exhausted and the bandit army has suffered heavy casualties. Under the pincer attack of the National Army from the north and south, even if they do not encounter the annihilation of the entire army, at least the main force will be wiped out in large part. Due to the convenience of transportation, communication, supply and transportation, and the enthusiasm of the local people for supporting the National Army, coupled with the convenience of air force coordination and support operations, and the favorable terrain, it is obviously beneficial to the National Army.

(3) Outlook on the War Situation

Since the Battle of Xuzhou has come to an end, Xuzhou is naturally no longer as important as it used to be in the strategic significance of the National Army concentrating its forces southward to strike the main force of the bandits. At present, the main army corps of Qiu, Sun, and Li of the National Army have mostly advanced along both sides of the Jinpu Line to attack the main force of the bandits in the Suxian area. Chen and Liu's bandits also had to leave the Xuzhou area under the pressure of our north and south army corps to make the final resistance. Therefore, the center of gravity of the war situation has gradually shifted away from Xuzhou. Liu Bocheng's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 9th, and 11th columns are currently fighting with our Miao Wei Army Corps in the area south of the Hui River and north of the Wo River. The large army of the Qiu and Sun Army Corps south of Xuzhou are attacking and breaking through Chen's bandit's resistance to the south. The meeting of the National Army from the north and south is expected to materialize soon. The communist bandits' forces are dispersed and are being attacked on all sides by the National Army. In any case, there is no hope of a lucky victory. Although small groups of communist bandits can still flee around, their strength is limited. Therefore, the Jianghuai war situation can be expected to stabilize quickly in the future, and if the communist bandits want to advance south again, they will suffer even more severe blows than in the Xuzhou-Su battle.

### First Meeting of Neutral Country Experts: Discussing the Berlin Monetary System Problem; British and American Zones in Germany Adopt Preparatory Measures to Prevent the Communist Party from Causing Trouble on Election Day

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 1st] Before departing for Rome tonight, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia stated: Vyshinsky has allowed the dispatch of Soviet financial experts to assist in resolving the Berlin monetary system problem, so the experts from various neutral countries have begun working this afternoon, with experts dispatched by UN Secretary-General Lie to assist.

[United Press, Paris, 1st] A key French official stated today: Before the six neutral countries on the Security Council resolve the Berlin problem, what new actions must still be taken? Even if an agreement can be reached on the two issues of a unified currency and the lifting of the blockade, the division of the municipality still exists, so this division must be remedied before the four countries can jointly manage the currency system.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 2nd] With the support of the three Western powers, the West German police deployed posts around the residences of anti-communist leaders on the 2nd and have decided on a plan to prevent the Communist Party from sabotaging the Berlin West District municipal elections on the 5th. Another Berlin municipal organization supported by the Soviet Union is already working in the East District. The brother of Berlin Mayor Aiter, appointed by the Soviet Union, condemned his brother's position after the West German police took preventive measures and called on people in the Berlin West District to vote against the Communist Party on the 5th. Strong armored patrols have been ordered to be ready to move out to quell possible unrest in the West District on election day. Plainclothes officers have been dispatched to polling places. On the evening of the 30th, Communist agitators attempted to disrupt a Socialist Party meeting held in the U.S. military zone. The police rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and dispersed the crowd. Ten Communists were arrested and released the next morning.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 1st] Christian Democratic leader Bramann stated at an election rally in the French-occupied zone today: "If Ebert, the first president of the Weimar Republic, knew of the shameless behavior of his unworthy son, he would surely weep bitterly in the ground. The late president devoted his life to preventing Germany from being invaded by the Bolsheviks, but now his unworthy son has become a puppet of the Bolsheviks."

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 1st] The original Berlin City Council held a meeting in the British-occupied zone today. Council Chairman Schaal stated: "Without the support of a certain occupying country, Soviet-occupied Berlin cannot establish a counter-government." Schaal pointed out that the new municipal government's resolutions were illegal, and then read out three urgent motions signed by several councilors: (1) Openly and thoroughly investigate the actions of Assistant Mayor Ackel and Councilor Wibe (both Communist Party members), (2) Call on all city councilors in the Soviet zone to resign and not be tools of the illegal municipal government, and (3) Because of the illegal election by the Communist Party yesterday, the crisis in Berlin has deepened, so the City Council must continue to perform its duties.

### UN General Assembly Political Committee Adopts British and American Plan for the Holy Land: Establishing a Committee to Assist Arab-Jewish Border Negotiation

This plan will establish a committee to assist Arab-Jewish negotiations on border demarcation. The committee also rejected Australia's proposal by a vote of 24 to 13, with 12 abstentions, to use the United Nations' original partition plan as a "starting point" for promoting Arab-Jewish resolution of the Holy Land issue.

### Security Council Meets to Discuss Israel's Membership Issue

[United Press, Paris, 1st] The Political Committee addressed the issue of Israel's membership today. The United States, Britain, and France all believed that it was not yet the time for this committee to discuss this issue and that the Security Council should discuss it first. The Security Council is scheduled to discuss it on the 2nd, but it is feared that no resolution will be reached.

[United Press, Paris, 2nd] Syrian Representative Curie to the UN General Assembly hinted to reporters today that if Israel is allowed to join the United Nations, the Arab countries will withdraw from the United Nations. Allowing Israel to join would be tantamount to publicly rewarding the murder of UN mediator Bernadotte. At that time, the six Arab countries will reconsider their membership in the United Nations.

### UN General Assembly Session: Not Necessarily Extended

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 2nd] The UN General Assembly was originally scheduled to close on December 11, but delegations, including those from France and most Western European countries, are said to advocate for an extension to continue discussing the remaining issues so that a conclusion can be reached on all issues by the beginning of January next year.

The three points agreed upon are (1) the issue of Germany's participation in international conferences; (2) the issue of Germany sending commercial representatives abroad; and (3) the judicial issue of refugees. Regarding the first point, the three commanders-in-chief agreed that for the sake of European economic cooperation, Germany should be able to send representatives to international conferences, but the final decision-making power still rests with the occupying countries, and German experts will provide opinions. Regarding the second point, the three commanders decided that Germany could send commercial representatives to foreign countries with the approval of the occupying authorities, but they must not have diplomatic power. Regarding the third point, the three commanders decided that the German government should exercise judicial power over foreign refugees who commit crimes in Germany. The two points on which the three commanders-in-chief did not reach an agreement were (1) the issue of an arbitration mechanism in case of disputes in the occupation political system; and (2) the issue of occupation costs. Regarding the first point, the United States and Britain suggested that German representatives should participate in the arbitration mechanism, while France insisted that the arbitration should be entirely by representatives of the occupying countries. Regarding the second point, the United States and Britain suggested that the occupation costs should be collected and paid by the federal government, while France advocated that they should be borne by the provincial governments.

Professors from various universities in Shanghai, including Zhu Guozhang and Chen Boji, and 43 others, issued a letter to the people of the world yesterday, urging democratic countries to strengthen aid to China. The original text is as follows: We, in the position of university professors, declare that communism is a threat to the basic freedom of mankind. Communism violates all principles of human social life. Communism violates all moral and spiritual values and religious values. The success of communism is the loss of human dignity and the destruction of a civilized way of life.

Dream of Realizing the World Revolution

The Chinese Communist Party is indifferent to the interests of the Chinese nation. The Chinese Communist Party is not a rural reformist, as they and their companions claim. The Chinese Communist Party cannot be regarded as an ordinary political party as understood by Westerners.

The Chinese Communist Party is a branch of international communism. Judging from Mao Zedong's recent celebration of the Soviet October Revolution, it is clear that its ultimate goal is its dream of world revolution. It is ostensibly resisting the Chinese government, but in reality, it is the vanguard of the international communist aggression forces. Once the opportunity matures, the masters hidden behind the Iron Curtain will attack all democratic and peace-loving countries in the world.

Rise Up and Accept the Challenge

The Chinese government is currently fighting alone against the combined forces of international communism in the Far East. After eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, coupled with the lack of a foundation for industrial construction, it will inevitably retreat step by step, just as the Chinese government inevitably retreated when fighting Japan alone for several years before the Pearl Harbor Incident. We do not believe that there must be a second Pearl Harbor Incident to incite the governments of other democratic countries to take positive action. On the contrary, we believe that other democratic countries will not allow totalitarian forces to occupy mainland China, and for the sake of purely self-defense and the protection of the three sacred principles of life, freedom, and happiness, other democratic countries must rise up and accept the challenge of totalitarian forces.

The Situation is Critical, Do Not Stand Idly By

We will never ask others for aid that they are reluctant to give, but we require that the current problem must be clearly stated and the meaning of this problem must be clearly understood. In our understanding, the current situation is extremely clear. The mortal battle currently being waged by the Chinese government against the Chinese Communist Party is part of a global ideological war between democracy and communist totalitarianism. If democratic countries are unwilling to provide material and moral support to the Chinese government during this critical period, it is tantamount to indirectly assisting the growth of aggression forces. If the Chinese government meets the attack of international communism alone, it cannot but fail.

Any Aid, Hope it Will Arrive Immediately

Since the current problem is global, we must emphasize that democratic countries should also accept this challenge on a global basis. The threat of world communism is increasing day by day. The strategy of democratic countries must be fundamentally changed and based on the needs of the whole world. This new strategy should start with rescuing the most urgent battlefields. We are in China and know it better, and we solemnly declare: Chinese democratic forces are facing a serious situation. Any aid must arrive immediately. If other democratic countries delay taking positive steps, it will only help the aggressive forces of totalitarianism. In short, the current problem is "now", otherwise "it will be too late".

### Coal Stored in Three Mines: Shipped to Shanghai in Batches, Should Arrive Within Days

In order to solve the coal shortage in this city, the coal mines in Keelung, Taiwan, and Huainan, East China, are rushing to load and ship their stored coal to Shanghai. It is reported that Taiwan can have more than 10,000 tons arriving in Shanghai within days, in two batches. East China and Huainan also have more than 5,000 tons of coal that can be shipped within days. After this coal arrives, the coal needed by various institutions in this city at the beginning of this month will be distributed successively.

### Fourty Thousand Tons of Taiwanese Coal Being Hastily Transported to Shanghai

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 2nd] Currently, Keelung has a stockpile of 40,000 tons of coal, and it is being hastily transported to Shanghai to alleviate the coal shortage. On the morning of the 30th, the "Wan Zhou" transported 5,047 tons of coal to Shanghai, and in the afternoon, the "Fu Mao" transported 5,800 tons of coal to Shanghai. The "Fu Min" ship, carrying 2,700 tons of coal, is also scheduled to sail to Shanghai on the 1st. Additionally, the "Lu Xing" ship, capable of carrying 7,500 tons, the "Yong Xing" ship, capable of carrying 4,000 tons, and the "Chang Li" ship, capable of carrying 6,400 tons, have all arrived in Keelung and are currently loading coal. These three ships are also scheduled to sail to Shanghai this weekend. There are also five ships scheduled to arrive in Keelung within days to load coal, namely the "Tai An" ship, capable of carrying 8,500 tons, the "An Da" ship, capable of carrying 6,400 tons, the "Tai Kang" ship, capable of carrying 4,500 tons, and the "Wu Dong" ship, capable of carrying 7,500 tons. In total, there will be over 66,000 tons of Taiwanese coal transported to Shanghai. In addition to the current stockpile of 40,000 tons in Keelung, recent coal production from various mines will also be transported and stored in Keelung. However, due to the rainy season in Keelung, the daily coal loading capacity is only about 2,000 tons. Therefore, in reality, the above-mentioned ships cannot load coal simultaneously and will need some time to sail out one after another. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce stipulates that 50,000 tons of Taiwanese coal should be shipped out for export each month, with 40,000 tons transported to Shanghai, 8,000 tons to Guangzhou, and another 2,000 tons divided between Fuzhou and Xiamen. Due to the current monthly production of Taiwanese coal decreasing from 150,000 tons to 120,000 tons, the actual amount of coal transported to Shanghai in November only reached 34,000 tons.

Furthermore, it is learned that the "Hai Gan" and "Ping Yuan" ships, carrying a total of 4,500 tons of coal, are heading to Guangzhou. The latter sailed from Keelung on the 1st.

### Direct Train from Beijing to Guangzhou to Commence on the 11th; Full Journey to Take Three Days; United Transportation Tickets to Be Sold Temporarily Before Implementation

[Reported by This Newspaper] Regarding the direct train service from Beijing to Guangzhou, jointly operated by the Beijing-Shanghai, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Guangdong-Hankou railways, people from all walks of life are highly interested. Recently, there have been various rumors, with some saying that united transportation has already been implemented since the 1st of this month, others saying that direct train service from Beijing to Guangzhou has commenced, and still others saying that only united transportation of luggage and parcels is accepted. Opinions vary and there is no consensus. According to investigations by this newspaper's reporter: since the completion of the full restoration of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway on July 30th this year, the United Transportation Department of the Ministry of Transportation has been planning direct train service from Beijing to Guangzhou. Originally scheduled to start on New Year's Day next year, it has been implemented earlier due to the needs of the current situation. The project of laying steel rails on the wooden temporary bridge of the Zhangshu Bridge on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was completed on the 30th of last month, and a trial train was successfully run yesterday. Therefore, the steel rails from Nanjing to Guangzhou are now fully connected. However, the carriages required for the direct train from Beijing to Guangzhou are still a problem. The Ministry of Transportation is currently planning to use two trains formed from vehicles withdrawn from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to operate between Beijing and Guangzhou. If the carriage problem is resolved smoothly, the official opening is scheduled for the 11th of this month. The entire journey will take three days. After the opening, a train will depart from both Beijing and Guangzhou every three days simultaneously. For example, if the first train departs from Nanjing on the 11th and arrives in Guangzhou on the 13th, the second train will head south again on the 14th, while the first train in Guangzhou will also begin its return journey north. As for the train schedule, ticket prices, and other technical issues, they are still awaiting consultation and formulation by the three railways. Before the direct train service is realized, united transportation tickets from Beijing to Guangzhou will be sold starting on the 1st of this month, which is the so-called three-railway united transportation. However, only three tickets are sold daily in Beijing and Shanghai, one first-class and two second-class. Only passengers holding this type of united transportation ticket will have their luggage and parcels accepted for united transportation by the railway bureau. However, due to the limited number of tickets available, it is difficult for passengers to purchase them, so it is almost as good as not having them. These tickets are temporarily sold by the travel service offices of the railway bureaus in Beijing and Shanghai. However, this united transportation is in fact equivalent to "connecting transport," as passengers still need to change trains between the Beijing-Shanghai, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Guangdong-Hankou railways, which is completely different from direct train service.

Railway Fare Adjustment Not Approved by the Central Government

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Beijing-Shanghai, Jiangnan, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Guangdong-Hankou, and other railways, due to their inability to balance revenue and expenditure, had requested the Ministry of Transportation to adjust passenger and freight fares. Yesterday, it was widely rumored that the new price list would increase by six times and would be implemented today. However, around 8 p.m. last night, it was learned that the central government had not approved the railway's request for fare increases. Therefore, today's train ticket prices remain the same as before.

### Patriotic Girls' High School Anniversary Celebration with Performances and Games

Patriotic Girls' High School, located on Nanyang Road in this city, was established ten years before the Republic of China. The founder was Mr. Cai Yuanpei. The 2nd of this month marks the 47th anniversary of the school's establishment. The school authorities are aware of the difficult times and do not wish to take any major actions. However, the students believe that on this annual anniversary, they should celebrate on their own initiative. Therefore, they initiated an afternoon of performances and games to entertain their families and celebrate. The program includes "Lark Singing," "Spring Ploughing," "Serenade Beyond the Great Wall," and "Teacher's Bitter Wait," which are said to be particularly wonderful.

### Anxin Middle School Raises Funds to Subsidize Teachers

The private Anxin Middle School in this city was founded by the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai. The teachers and staff's salaries for this semester were paid for four months after the start of the school year. The remaining amount could not be paid due to the cancellation of price limits, which has had some impact. However, considering that the families of the students are also facing many difficulties, the school is adhering to its original intention and has decided not to collect a second installment of fees. Instead, the chairman of the Native Association, Liu Hongsheng, the chairman of the board, Wei Bozhen, and others have initiated a fundraising campaign to provide subsidies.

### Aurora University Affiliated High School to Hold Concert Tomorrow

### 200,000 Citizens Have Not Received ID Cards; Seven Measures for Supplementary Application Announced by the Civil Affairs Bureau Yesterday

[Reported by This Newspaper] According to the Civil Affairs Bureau, during the general household registration census conducted in this city last month, approximately 200,000 citizens were unable to obtain new national identity cards for various reasons. Now, in order to expedite the resumption of supplementary application procedures, seven measures have been stipulated and announced for implementation: (1) All those who have not received their new cards must, from the 5th to the 10th of this month, fill out a supplementary application form and promptly submit it, along with all required documents, to the local Bao Office, which will then forward it to the District Office.

The date of issuance will be announced separately by the Municipal Government. (2) Those without old cards should submit three additional photos and fill out an application form. Those with old cards can reuse the old photos. (3) Those who were not present during the census should provide a signed statement that they will not apply for or fraudulently obtain another card, along with a certificate from the Baojia chief, and submit their old Shanghai identity card and one photo. (4) Those who have lost their old cards but have not yet declared them invalid in the newspaper should submit the entire newspaper containing the lost item declaration and one photo. (5) Those who have registered their household but have not yet received their cards should submit three additional photos and fill out a new card application form. (6) Those whose new card information is filled out incorrectly should declare the incorrect information. Other procedures are the same as before. (7) Those whose new card was taken to another location by citizens before the seal was affixed during the census should return the new card for the seal to be affixed.

### Educational Scum: Shen Qi'er Induces and Rapes Female Students; Victim Appeals for Assistance

[Reported by This Newspaper] Dai Yunsu, a widow from Shaoxing, has lived in Shanghai for many years. She received secondary education and is currently working as a secretary and living at the labor union of stall vendors at No. 62, Lane K, No. 432, Xinchang Road. She has only one daughter, named Wenjuan, who is 14 years old. Since childhood, she has relied entirely on her mother's income to support her. This summer, the woman sent Wenjuan to the fourth grade of Liuyun Elementary School at No. 100, Fusantang Street, Xiaonanmen, Nanshi. Because the school is far from home, she boarded in the dormitory on the right side of the second floor. Shen Qi'er (23 years old, from Chongming), a teacher at the school, taught general knowledge, abacus, drawing, labor, and other courses to all grades. His room was next to Dai's daughter. Seeing that the girl was young and could be deceived, he constantly seduced her. One midnight in October, he crept into Wenjuan's room and used a gold ring as bait to commit rape. A week later, he repeatedly defiled her and gave her small items such as yarn, towels, soap, and snow cream, telling her not to make a fuss. Wenjuan then fell into his trap and kept silent. On the morning of the 27th of last month, the girl's mother went to the school to visit her. She suddenly found a letter written by her daughter to someone named "Qi'er" on the desk in the dormitory, and the content seemed to indicate obscene behavior. She searched the dormitory and found dirty objects under the mattress. After inquiring with Lu Shanchang, the director of teaching affairs at the school, she learned that "Qi'er" was the school teacher Shen Qi'er. The woman immediately negotiated with Principal Tong and asked him to detain Shen immediately. Tong pleaded with her not to publicize the matter and to discuss a solution later. He promised to be responsible for keeping Shen Qi'er under surveillance and assured her that there was no risk of him absconding. At that time, Wu Ming, the abbot of Jieyin Temple and a member of the Liuyun Elementary School board of directors, was also invited to the scene to persuade her, and the woman temporarily endured. However, on the 30th of last month, Tong suddenly claimed that Shen had fled and was being searched for. Hearing this, Dai believed that Tong was clearly protecting Shen. She reported the matter to the Penglai Police Precinct in charge on the previous day, requesting that Shen Qi'er be arrested. At the same time, she submitted a document to the Women's Federation and the Shaoxing Native Association in Shanghai, appealing for justice.

### Business Scope of Shanghai Import and Export Firms Narrowed

It is learned that recently, several import and export firms in this city have reduced their business scope and laid off internal staff, preparing to move south. In the past, they profited more from imports than exports. Import merchants highly valued the import quotas allocated by the Import and Export Control Committee and often sought to import various raw materials and supplies with their own foreign exchange. Now, they are unwilling to import materials anymore, delaying the collection of quotas allocated by the Import and Export Control Committee. They are also diverting materials imported with their own foreign exchange to Guangzhou or Hong Kong, and Shanghai's business has invisibly decreased. On the export side, all current exports are inventory. Exporters now only seek to sell off their inventory, no longer purchasing export goods from rural areas. To date, it is estimated that exporters have sold off three-quarters of their inventory, so their business scope is gradually shrinking. According to a tycoon in the import and export industry, they do not plan to expand their import and export business in Shanghai for the time being. They predict that Guangzhou's export volume will surpass Shanghai and rank first in the country next year.

Yesterday, the Qingbai soccer team of this city celebrated its fourth anniversary. To celebrate winning the Mayor's Cup for the third consecutive time and obtaining permanent preservation rights, they played a commemorative soccer match against Xin Xianlin at the Nanshi Stadium at 3 p.m. There were over 2,000 spectators, and the atmosphere was lively. As a result of the match, Qingbai led 2-1 in the first half. In the second half, Xin Xianlin counterattacked and tied the game 2-2 until the end. The lineups for the two teams are as follows:

Xin Xianlin kicked off, and Qingbai counterattacked. After about ten minutes of fierce battle, Qingbai seized the opportunity to attack. Gu Yisa hooked the ball, and Qu Yongfu arrived and shot hard, but unfortunately, it was slightly high and went over the bar. Qingbai attacked again. Jin Gengsheng passed, and Xiao Gao headed the ball, but Xin Xianlin cleared it with a long kick. Xin Xianlin got a breather, but at the 15-minute mark, Luo Shoufu suddenly showed his might, slicing through three defenders and scoring, putting Qingbai in the lead. In less than three minutes, Xin Xianlin launched a full-scale counterattack. Gao Xiuqing penetrated deep, and Huang Shijie could not defend. In a one-on-one situation, they tied the score. At the 20-minute mark, Qingbai launched another major attack. Xiao Gu weaved back and forth, and Afu kicked, the ball falling into the net, putting Qingbai ahead again 2-1. The first half ended with the score at 2-1. After the break, the lineups of the two teams were slightly adjusted. Xin Xianlin attacked more. At the 5-minute mark, Qingbai's Meng Yiliang committed a foul 25 yards out, and Chunhua took the free kick, but it flew out of bounds. Guan Yongchang shot hard, but it was saved by Huang Shijie for a corner kick. At the 20-minute mark, Xin Xianlin's Xiao Gao Ziwen scored twice, Shijie rushed out, and scored into the empty goal, but unfortunately, it was ruled offside. The two sides fought fiercely until the game was about to end, when Fei Chunhua hooked the ball from the right baseline. Xiao Ziwen rushed forward, and Huang Shijie failed to save the empty goal. Ziwen kicked the ball, which rolled into the net, tying the score again at 2-2. Shortly after, the game ended, and the two teams shook hands and drew.

### Central Bank Increases Issuance of Five Types of Gold Yuan Notes Starting Yesterday

In order to solve the shortage of banknotes, the Central Bank officially issued a public announcement yesterday, increasing the issuance of five types of Gold Yuan notes. These include one type of 5 jiao transfer note and one type of 10 yuan note. Both types were printed by the Central Printing Factory.

### Increase in Capital of Banks and Firms in Cash

Silver and Money Industry Demands Freedom to Use

Regarding the portion of the increase in capital of banks and firms in cash, according to the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, it must be deposited in the Central Bank for three months before it can be used. This measure has caused considerable difficulties for the silver and money industry, because the increase in capital in cash is needed for the banks and firms to turn over their own funds and for lending purposes. The industry has jointly requested the Ministry of Finance to exempt it from depositing. After Xu Kan took office as Minister of Finance, he only provided accommodating arrangements for the deposit period and decided after discussion that those that comply with the provisions of the Banking Law and undertake mortgage loans with a fixed term of more than one month, if the banks and firms do not have enough funds for turnover, they can overdraft their increased capital in cash. It is reported that the silver and money industries are still not satisfied with the above-mentioned supplementary measures. Therefore, yesterday the Bankers Association convened a meeting of standing directors to discuss the issue of depositing and using increased capital in cash. It was decided to request the Ministry of Finance to allow free use or exemption from deposit.

### Large Increase in Returned Checks; Gold Control Bureau Decides to Strengthen Inspection

It is learned that recently, due to the exchange of gold and silver dollars, the need for cash has increased, and more people are discounting bills, which has led to a surge in returned checks. According to statistics released by the Gold Control Bureau, the total amount of returned checks on November 27th (last Saturday) was 5,443,354.96 yuan, totaling 1,768 checks. On Monday of this week (November 29th), the total amount of returned checks was 34,371,294.11 yuan, totaling 5,119 checks, an increase of 28,892,939.15 yuan and 3,350 checks compared to last Saturday. On Tuesday of this week (November 30th), the total amount of returned checks was 58,230,422.95 yuan, totaling 7,427 checks, an increase of 23,859,128.84 yuan and 2,308 checks compared to Monday. Compared with the amount of returned checks last Saturday, the amount of returned checks this Tuesday increased by more than eleven times. It is learned that in order to stabilize finance, the bureau will send personnel to be stationed at the Shanghai Check Clearing House to conduct strict inspections.

### Cotton Yarn Prices Weak

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market remained sluggish and listless because both local and visiting buyers remained hesitant. Sellers in the market continued to supply goods, and the market remained weak. Forty-two count Blue Phoenix fine yarn, initially called for a higher price due to limited selling, immediately surged by 700 yuan. However, as sellers flooded in, it fell back to close at 10,200 yuan, a further drop of 400 yuan compared to the previous day. Forty-count Jincheng plunged by 1,000 yuan, closing at 9,000 yuan. Twenty-one count Double Horse yarn also initially rose by 600 yuan, but as retailers saw the high price, their intention to sell was very firm, and it quickly fell back to close at 7,000 yuan, a further drop of 500 yuan. The prices of other counts of fine yarn also consistently fell by 200 to 1,200 yuan because manufacturers continued to supply smoothly and the weaving industry had little interest in buying.

Due to the wait-and-see attitude of buyers, the cotton cloth market remained depressed. Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 365 yuan, but major merchants from the North continued to sell off, and local buying was extremely limited, gradually falling to 45 yuan. However, by the afternoon, visiting merchants took advantage of the low prices to absorb some, and it rebounded to close at 365 yuan, a drop of 15 yuan compared to the afternoon of the previous day. Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji was traded at 365 yuan due to slight demand from Hankou and Fujian merchants, and the price once rose slightly. However, due to the tight funds of cloth merchants, there was a lot of selling off, and it finally closed at 365 yuan, a drop of 10 yuan. Jin Lian Miaowu Biji was traded at 350 yuan.

### Deposit Reserve Interest Increased to Twelve Cents

Extension of Exchange of Gold and Silver at Branches Decided

Regarding the interest on deposit reserves of commercial banks and firms, the Central Bank had previously stipulated it to be two cents per month. However, recently, due to the tight money market and high shadow interest rates, various banks and firms have requested an increase. It has now been learned from the National Bank that they have decided to raise it to twelve cents per month, starting this month.

[Another Report] The exchange of gold and silver for deposits, originally scheduled to be handled by the branches of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Chen's Bank starting yesterday, has been postponed due to insufficient preparation. Yesterday, those exchanging at various banks were still extremely crowded.

### Low Prices Reported for Produce, Money Supply Remains Tight Rice Prices Continue to Fall in Both Northern and Southern Markets Sales of Flour, Oil, and Grain Are Very Sluggish

The rice market is deteriorating daily, with prices continuing to decline. Production areas continue to report low prices, the money supply remains tight, people are uneasy, and demand is scarce. In the northern market, white polished rice fell by twenty yuan to three hundred and fifty yuan, and thin rice also sold for three hundred and fifty yuan, a decrease of thirty yuan. Early rice fell by twenty-five yuan, and both cloudy and variant rice each dropped by thirty yuan. The southern market opened steadily in the morning, but sales remained sluggish, and prices were suppressed by about ten yuan due to unsold goods at closing, although market quotations did not decrease. Yesterday, 3,147 piculs arrived at the southern market and 5,349 piculs at the northern market.

Flour reported another decline. Prices in the tin market fell, causing nervousness. Holders were eager to sell. The money supply remained tight, and demand was weak. Old "Car" brand flour was last priced at one hundred and eight yuan, a decrease of ten yuan. "Battleship" brand flour fell below one hundred yuan after the price was announced, a sharp decrease of fifteen yuan. Red Bee and other miscellaneous brands mostly fell below one hundred yuan, closing at low prices. The market situation was very weak. Bran intake was small, a drop of thirty-two yuan.

People were nervous about miscellaneous grains, sales were sluggish, and there were few purchases. Soybeans fell by five to ten yuan. Qingdao corn showed no interest, and the price plummeted by more than twenty yuan. Red sorghum fell by more than ten yuan, choose green. Account beans each fell by more than ten yuan, sesame seeds had few buyers. Raw peanut kernels from Guangdong were shipped south and rose alone, rebounding by sixty yuan.

Edible oil fluctuated slightly upward, due to excessive consecutive declines, holders pushed prices higher. Actual sales were slightly active yesterday, and factory quotations were also reduced. Da Chen Xin has not yet opened. The initial factory price for soybean oil was six hundred yuan, and for rapeseed oil, five hundred yuan. Later, actual sales absorbed demand and rose. At closing, soybean oil rebounded to six hundred and twenty yuan and rapeseed oil to five hundred and twenty yuan, each seeing a rebound of twenty yuan. Raw oil closed at seven hundred yuan, still a reduction of twenty yuan. Small car sesame oil initially opened at six hundred and eighty, closing at seven hundred and five yuan, still a small reduction of fifteen yuan. Soybean cake was stable.

### Tea Market Transactions Narrow

Since the money supply has become tight, exporters have continued to be bearish, and the buying atmosphere has remained hesitant since most merchants with relatively limited resources devalued their tea stocks for sales. As a result, transactions remained narrow. Under such circumstances, the ground underfoot is precarious, and the future does not bode well. As for domestic tea, acceptance and transfer is still occurring in this street and other places, but due to the impact of the foreign tea market, it is also weak and fluctuates.

Food Continues to Plunge

The sugar market continued its disastrous fall yesterday. Money was tight among peers, actual sales on this street were dwindling, customers from various regions turned from buyers to sellers, and the market was flooded with sales. Confidence was extremely shaken, and prices plummeted across the board. No. 45 Car White Machine closed at 320 yuan, falling 50 yuan, while medium and coarse sugar each fell a small 35 yuan. The remaining Xinghua white and red sugar, as well as the factory's refined white sugar, all fell by a small 15%.

### Lumber Market Prices Fall

The lumber market situation is becoming increasingly unsustainable. Foreign pine has fallen from $4.50 to $3.80, and large sizes can be purchased for $3.50. Ansan plywood has plummeted to $15-$18, a drop of 300% from its peak. Fir lumber also fell again, opening at $1.00 and $1.10, but a consumption of over 10,000 feet could be purchased at $.90-$1.00. Only pine lumber's base is relatively strong, because it is sawn into firewood and the selling price is higher.

### Silk is Stable and Soft

The silk market turned better yesterday, and people felt at ease. The CITC's allocation of goods has been delayed this week, and the market's demand is slightly stronger, and the market is seeing a slight increase. No. 120 Tianqiao opened in the morning at 9000 yuan, with few sellers. Sentiment immediately improved, and bid prices rose by 500 yuan by the close. Dongyang initially traded at 9500 yuan, but loose sellers were willing to sell, and the market lacked momentum to rise. Until the close, it rose slightly by 200 yuan. The remaining goods in various buildings increased by 300-500 yuan.

Exports of raw silk have loosened, and foreign firms are showing some interest, and people are becoming more friendly. However, holders who have been depressed for a long time are thinking of selling, and the market has more chips, and the market is stable, and the market price is a reduction. D-grade 78 evenness white factory silk was traded yesterday for 10,500 yuan, and superior grades were listed at 10,000 yuan, and intake was more vigorous than the previous day, but prices are still difficult to improve.

The silk and satin market became quiet again yesterday, with both supply and demand scarce and the market situation again becoming weak. Huaqiang quilt covers had few transactions, and no one asked after the opening, and prices continued to drop slightly, closing at 6,800 yuan for cash. Dawei wool and other transactions were not concluded.

### Inquiring About Politics in Xinyang

— Special Correspondent Fang Canglang

[Report from our Xinyang Office on the 28th] The favorable military situation in southern Henan and northern Hubei has created a small-scale peace in the Central China war zone, which may have a supporting and stabilizing effect on the overall war situation. The political and economic measures here are sufficient to show whether the government can effectively carry out a total war to reverse the crisis. What is recorded here can give a general idea:

Southern Henan Has a Future, Talent Must Go to the Countryside

Since Zhengzhou and Kaifeng were abandoned and the Henan Provincial Government moved south to Xinyang, this corner of southern Henan has become a good base for the Henan Provincial Government to implement a total war integrating military, political, and economic efforts. Southern Henan (Xinyang, Huangchuan, Gushi, Shangcheng, Luoshan, and Guangshan counties) relies on the water conservancy of the Huai River and its tributaries, and its agricultural production is extremely prosperous. Moreover, its climate is close to that of Jiangcheng, with abundant rice production. Because its folk customs are solid and there are no idle people, there are soldiers who can be used. Therefore, in the past one or two years, after General Zhang Zhen, commander of the Fifth Pacification Zone, continuously promoted a moderate pacification policy, the local people have considerable confidence in the current government. When General Zhang Zhen took charge of the government of Henan, it was at a time when the situation in Henan had undergone major changes after the abandonment of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng. He struggled for more than twenty days just to solve the problem of moving the thousands of civil servants. Now, a problem has finally been solved in a more reasonable way. Recently, the Henan Provincial Government ordered the civil servants who were originally scheduled to move to Xinyang, accounting for two-fifths of the total, to report to Xinyang by the end of November. Those who were originally scheduled to move to eastern Henan, northern Henan, or stay in Kaifeng, accounting for three-fifths of the total, may still report to Xinyang before the end of this year if they are unable to go due to changes in the war situation and obstructed transportation. Those who fail to do so will be removed from the list. This method is not only reasonable but also humane, because at this time, while it is necessary to win over the hearts of the people, it is also necessary to win over the hearts of some small civil servants who are seemingly indifferent but steadfast and impoverished.

Xinyang is a small city on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. Before the war, it had a population of only 40,000 to 50,000. Now, with the difficulties, officials and people have come in droves. In addition, the place is where large armies from the north and south gather, and there are many merchants. The population has suddenly increased by more than two times, and the housing shortage is extremely serious.

The Morale of the Military and Civilians is Usable, Presenting a Small Scale of Peace

In order to solve the urgent need for office space, the Henan Provincial Government has specially built 200 thatched houses for the joint office of the provincial government and various departments. The 54-year-old general runs to the front of those thatched houses almost every day to supervise the work. It is really hard enough for him, but there are more difficulties than this. According to General Zhang, the central government hopes that the Henan provincial-level civil servants will not exceed 150, but the personnel of the various departments who have reported in have exceeded half a hundred, and there are at least 400 to 500 people who are still struggling to eat and sell everything and running to Xinyang. What to do? Therefore, the Henan Provincial Government seized the opportunity and formulated a method of retaining the original salary and encouraging talent to go to the countryside to solve the problem. It plans to select some promising and principled senior and middle-level administrative cadres, organize a guidance corps, and go to the counties to work in a circuitous manner. It hopes that they will go to the countryside to carry out a true anti-exploitation and anti-persecution movement, abolish all unreasonable apportionments, and achieve equality, average, and fairness in all burdens of the people for suppressing the rebellion. After this method is implemented, some counties in southern Henan may have some simply appointed district heads, township heads, and village chiefs to revitalize the declining customs, awaken the people, and participate in the total war. As to whether these simply appointed, recommended, and even commissioned first- and second-class personnel can accept this request, it is indeed worth considering. However, according to general opinion, this matter can be tried in southern Henan, because the counties in southern Henan near the railway have very low prices and food prices, and the place is relatively safe. Civil servants who are unwilling to wait for money or die will not regard going to the countryside as a daunting task. Moreover, now is a great era for heroes in the Central Plains to show their skills.

According to honest elders in Henan, the emergence of today's small-scale peace in southern Henan is due to the usability of the morale of the military, the morale of the soldiers, and the morale of the people, coupled with the leadership of the party, government, military, and public opinion organs, who can encourage and help each other, so there is a bright future.

Northern Hubei Suffers Famine, Burden Turns into Strength

Everywhere in Henan, you can see a pitiful scene. The suffering that the people have endured in the internal turmoil is difficult to describe. Among the 113 counties in the province, only the counties of Anyang in the third district of northern Henan, Xinxiang, Yangwu, and Jixian in the fourth district, Xiayi and Yucheng in the twelfth district of eastern Henan, and Huangchuan, Xinyang, Queshan, and Guangshan in the eighth and ninth districts of southern Henan can implement the central government's policies. The occupied areas account for nearly 85 percent. The matter is difficult to handle, but fortunately, the leading figures in this corner can still remember the ancient saying that "even if Chu has only three households, it can still destroy Qin," and work hard. Looking back at neighboring Hubei Province, especially northern Hubei, it is a different scene. In northern Hubei, thanks to the Huazhong Suppression Headquarters' effective efforts to suppress bandits in the past month, Sui County, Zaoyang, and more than a dozen large and small important strongholds on the periphery of Xiangfan and Laokou have been recovered successively, and the situation has changed. However, because the border area between Henan and Hubei has suffered from bandit disasters for a long time, most of the people have become sawdust. From Nanyang, Tanghe, and Xinye in southwestern Henan to Suizao and Xiangfan in northern Hubei, an area of more than a thousand miles is mostly barren due to the dispersal of strong men and the lack of farming cattle. Therefore, when General Wang Lingyun, commander of the Thirteenth Pacification Zone, led his team and more than 100,000 people, civil and military officials, and educators from Nanyang to Xiangfan at the beginning of this month, the price of rice in the local area once soared to nine yuan per catty due to the extreme shortage of food. During this period, tens of thousands of Chinese people endured hunger and suffering, left their beloved homes, and followed the national army to retreat, unwilling to stay in the bandit area to accept "liberation." This story is really moving, and the government should make good arrangements for these tens of thousands of righteous people. Recently, I heard that General Wang Lingyun is preparing to organize these tens of thousands of righteous people, civil servants, teachers, and students into three divisions in order to transform consumption into production and turn burdens into strength. At the same time, he plans to assist the farmers who have escaped to farm the land anytime and anywhere to alleviate the future food shortage. If this method can be transformed from plan into action, it is a manifestation of implementing total war.

Within Three Hundred Miles of Xuhuai, People are Forced to Join the Army

[Report from our Zhenjiang Office on the 1st] According to refugees who have just fled from Xu Dong in northern Jiangsu, "The Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu are coercing the vast number of people to join the army in order to respond to the Chen and Liu bandits' attacks on Xubeng. All young and strong people within 300 Chinese miles from Xuzhou to Huaiyin are forced to serve as people and logistics teams. What I saw along the way was that there was no trace of smoke in the villages and towns, and many autumn crops were still abandoned in the fields, with no one to harvest.

### Plague Spreads in Eastern Jiangxi, May Spread to Zhejiang and Anhui

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 1st] The plague in Wannian has spread widely, and the mortality rate has increased sharply. The Jiangxi Provincial Government has recently received a report that the epidemic is moving north, and cases have also been found in Le Ping County. An expert said that the disease may spread to Zhejiang and Anhui. The current Jiangxi Health Authority is making every effort to prevent it.

### Miniature News

Nantong

[Report from this newspaper] The Yu Xi District Office of this county received a tip that the bandits had set up a communications agency in Xinshi Market in Dongerjia Town, so they immediately sent personnel to search. As a result, they smashed a bandit communications station, arrested four bandit cadres, and seized multiple sending and receiving machines. They are now being interrogated separately.

Suzhou

[Report from this newspaper] The Xuzhou Branch of the Supreme Court of Jiangsu once submitted a request to the High Court to forward it to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for instructions on how to deal with emergencies. The court was ordered to evacuate the prisoners in accordance with the pacification zone evacuation method. However, when the order arrived, the battle had already broken out, and only important files and seals could be moved to a safe area. More than 200 prisoners were not able to move out. The president of the court happened to be in Beijing on official business and was unable to return in time, leaving only Judge Qin to be responsible in Xuzhou. There was once a riot, attempting to escape from prison, but fortunately it was handled properly and was not successful. The daily consumption of prisoners' food is considerable, and once the food runs out, the danger will be great. On the 29th, another telegram was sent to President Liang for instructions on emergency response measures.

[Another Report] In order to facilitate the supervision of the implementation of government orders in various counties, the Jiangsu Provincial Government decided to restore the Second Administrative Inspector and Security Commander's Office, which will administer 18 counties including Su, Xi, Chang, Wu, Cheng, Chu, Tai, and Kun. Han Han, a member of the Provincial Party Committee, will serve as the commissioner. The commissioner's office will be established in this city, and he will come to Suzhou immediately to deploy everything.

Quzhou

[Report from this newspaper] The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Food believes that the military situation for suppressing the rebellion is tense, the allocation of military food is frequent and urgent, and the Zhejiang region has been designated by the Ministry of Food as the main source of allocation. The new endowment for this year should be intensified and strictly collected, and it has been decided to complete it two months in advance. The above decision has been ordered to be followed by various counties.

Jiaxing

[Report from this newspaper] After the township offices reported the amount of regular crop harvest this year, the county government convened a meeting on the standard of early and late rice rent payment on November 30. After discussion, it was decided to check and determine the harvest amount reported by the 33 townships in the county separately (the harvest amount reported by the four townships of Sande, Lianyi, Shuangqiao, and Changxing was checked and determined according to the average harvest time of the four neighboring townships). According to statistics, the highest amount is five dou and two thousand and five he, and the lowest amount is two dou, two liters, and five he.

### Opinions on Improving Overcrowding on Buses, Reply from the Public Transportation Company

We have received a letter from Mr. Feiya through your department, suggesting improvements to public bus operations. The normal management of bus operations must operate according to the timetable. The company's setting of the timetable for each route is based on the different density of passengers within the total travel time of each route, and the interval time is adjusted. Currently, Routes 3 and 10 depart every three to four minutes, and Route 9 departs every five to eight minutes. The number of vehicles operated by the company on each route is allocated in a unified manner according to the needs of each route, and there is no reason to favor one over the other. As for the phenomenon that passengers are crowded at the starting and ending stations, it is difficult to get on the bus, and passengers at intermediate stations cannot board the bus, all public transportation in this city is inevitable. In addition to regulating the number of passengers at the starting and ending stations of each route, and urging the drivers to stop at each station so that passengers can board the bus in the middle, the company expresses its deep gratitude to Mr. Feiya for his enthusiastic concern. Sincerely, Social Service Department of Shen Bao, Shanghai Public Transportation Company Preparatory Committee

### Communism in China, September 1948, Compiled by the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee

— Special Translation by the Newspaper Translation Office

In 1930, the National Army attacked the Communists entrenched in Jiangxi Province, and it was not until 1934 that they were driven out. From November 1934, the Communists began their famous "Long March," their aim being to unite Communist parties in various regions to reach a remote and safe area. A year later, they arrived in the northwestern province of Shaanxi, where they settled and established Yan'an as their capital.

The war between the Kuomintang and the Communists is one of the most obscure episodes in modern history. The Communist tactics were fluid, and they had no fixed base. Due to advances and retreats, the Communists resorted to retaliatory measures, and the local people often suffered cruel massacres. The weapons used by the Communists were very simple, they were able to divide and reunite, and they often shifted positions.

By 1936, the cycle of war and peace between the Kuomintang and the Communists came to an end. Communism had formed a considerable force that could not be suppressed by any means of the National Government. The Communist base areas shifted from the southeast to the northwest. The non-Communist part of China had been unified, but the old divisions of warlord separatism were replaced by a more serious division created by Yan'an.

E. The Communist Party's Approach to Public Issues

Among many domestic Chinese issues, the Communist Party has spared no effort in propagandizing the land issue, often causing misunderstandings among foreigners. In reality, more than half of the farmers in China own their own land, and only a quarter are genuine tenants. Large estates are not common, and most landlords own relatively small estates. The land problem in China is mostly caused by the fact that the population is proportionally larger than the land. The CCP's promise to distribute large estates to farmers can, on the one hand, gain the support of local people, but it can also confuse the views of outsiders. In March 1948, the Communist Party adopted a new strategy on the land issue, specifically stipulating that no more than three percent of families in any given area should be treated as landlords, and no more than five percent should be treated as rich peasants, with the aim of limiting excessive liquidation.

This does not mean that the view that the CCP can solve China's economic and social problems is correct. There are two errors in this view: first, the Communist Party has not thoroughly solved the food problem, and their land problem solution is a demagogic trick. Second, the Communist Party's solution aims to absorb believers and allies, not a genuine Communist solution. Their land policy of calling on poor peasants in industrially backward countries is exactly the same as their high-wage policy in industrial countries.

Another Chinese problem that the Communist Party values is imperialism. China's modern national wars often have a strong xenophobic color. From the Boxer Rebellion, through the student movements after World War I and the Northern Expedition of the Kuomintang, to the anti-Soviet, anti-British, and anti-American riots in the past three years, they have all displayed the same tone of fear and contempt for imperialism. The CCP is fully aware of this fact. Although they have remained silent on the Soviet Union's control of Lushun and Dalian, they have tried their best to attack American aid to President Chiang, insulting him as a "running dog of American imperialism," and accusing American troops stationed in China of training Chinese people to massacre Chinese people with American weapons.

The national self-consciousness movement seems to be a necessary step for the advancement of backward countries on the one hand, and the most convenient tool for overthrowing the stable situation in the non-Soviet world on the other. The Communist Party supports these movements with the aim of overthrowing the balance of power in non-communist countries and weakening their national strength.

F. The Advantages of Chinese Communism

The Chinese Communist Party has transformed from a bare-handed force into one of the six most powerful Communist parties in the world. It started as a group of a small number of intellectuals, and now has a claimed membership of two million people nationwide. It now possesses a powerful army and controls a territory with a population as large as that of the United States.

The CCP's claims on domestic economic and social issues cannot explain the reasons for its development. The CCP's success depends on five major factors: (1) the assistance and leadership of world communism; (2) the Chinese Red Army; (3) territorial control; (4) propaganda value without competitors to contend with; (5) the advantages gained from the state of war.

The assistance that world communism gave to the Chinese Communist Party before World War II was in terms of ideology and training, not in terms of material resources. Before the collapse of the first united front in 1927, the Soviet Union had given a small amount of material assistance to the Guangzhou government under the control of the Kuomintang. During the first Communist-led civil war, communication between the CCP and the Soviet Union was cut off, and it was impossible to obtain sufficient material assistance. Even during World War II, Soviet material assistance to China was only given to the National Government and not to Yan'an. It was not until 1945, when the Soviet Union joined the war in the Far East and occupied the Northeast, that the situation suddenly changed, at which time the CCP's power had already expanded greatly.

The help that Moscow gave to the CCP was mainly its theory, strategic planning methods, and the training of young CCP cadres. It taught the CCP the techniques and methods of launching progressive movements, the magic of having an army without a government, the strategy of first cooperating with larger groups and then using them to achieve the Communist Party's goals, and the tactics of catering to people's preferences without abandoning rights. In short, this is a modern revolutionary method, knowledge of violent politics, half of which was applied to China by Moscow and half by local CCP members such as Mao Zedong.

The possession of the Chinese Red Army is essential for the implementation of the above-mentioned strategies. This army was established between 1926 and 1928, when the CCP was driven to the interior and tried to establish a Soviet Republic, but later felt that there were various inconveniences in establishing a formal government, and finally abandoned this attempt and only maintained the Red Army.

The Chinese Red Army is known for its elite. The core of the army maintained a high degree of loyalty and revolutionary consciousness. They used simple weapons, made the most of guerrilla tactics, and benefited from many well-trained leaders. The Red Army is the necessary foundation for the CCP's greatest factor of strength—territorial control. Since 1928, there has not been a single place in China that has not been turned into a Communist area by military occupation. There has not been a single Communist area that has not been lost after the Communist Party was driven out.

In the areas under its control, the Communist Party can manipulate propaganda and control schools. It is difficult for the CCP to absorb new party members in places where there is free competition; but when it controls a place, it can gain millions of believers.

Finally, a state of civil war and international war in an agricultural country is directly and indirectly beneficial to the Communist Party. When the Japanese or National Army occupied cities, the Communist Party could seize larger farms and distribute them to poor farmers, and could not be held responsible for the food supply of the cities. The Communist Party used the lack of a formal government as an excuse to avoid responsibility for national welfare.

Both civil war and international war give the CCP an excellent opportunity to enhance its strength. The most obvious example is that after Japan's surrender, the Soviet Union transferred Japanese military weapons to the Chinese Red Army, enabling the CCP to expand their power in the Northeast.

Three. The Second United Front A. Japanese Expansion

On September 17, 1931, a bomb suddenly exploded on the South Manchuria Railway track near Pan-yang. This incident triggered more than ten years of war until Japan surrendered in 1945. Initially, the Japanese invaded Northeast China and established a puppet state, "Manchukuo." On September 19, the Japanese army occupied Qiqihar, and at the end of the same year, the Chinese army stationed in the area withdrew south of the Great Wall.

On March 20, 1932, the Japanese army used the so-called provocation as an excuse to attack Shanghai. The 19th Route Army stationed there immediately launched a strong defense, but after two weeks of bloody battle, it was finally defeated. On May 5, under the pressure of the great powers, the Japanese signed a peace treaty and agreed to withdraw from the war zone.

In early 1933, the Japanese again invaded the provinces outside Guanwai, and local wars broke out. The Chinese army suffered repeated defeats, but the National Government did not accept the war. From that time on, the Japanese threat became stronger day by day. The CCP seized this opportunity to "declare war" on Japan, and used propaganda methods to force the National Government to take the same steps.

However, Chairman Chiang had to be responsible for China's diplomacy, while the Communist Party could not only declare war on Japan at will, but also obstruct the government's attempts to avoid a complete break with Japan. They launched anti-Japanese movements, demanding that the Kuomintang arm the people, and encouraging non-Communist groups and military groups to unite to resist Japan. Seeing the growing expansion of the patriotic movement, the central government had to find ways to suppress it, so the CCP denounced Chiang Kai-shek as pro-Japanese, and called the Soviet government and the Red Army the only persevering fighters of the National Revolutionary War. At the same time, under Japan's constant provocations, the Soviet government tried its best to avoid giving the Japanese an excuse to declare war on the Soviet Union.

Around 1935, the power of Germany and Japan on the east and west sides of the Soviet Union was growing. In order to cope with this threat, the strategy of world communism was revised in 1935, and the Communist International notified the Communist parties of various countries to organize a united front government with anti-fascist political parties. In China, the Communist Party, which had always denounced the Kuomintang leaders for betraying the country, also changed its strategy at this time and adopted a united front policy. However, it was not until the Xi'an Incident in December 1936 and the Lugouqiao Incident in the summer of 1937 that the second united front was formed. This triggered the war of resistance against Japan that Chairman Chiang tried to avoid or delay.

The truce and united front between the Kuomintang and the Communists decided in Xi'an were not realized until September 1937. On July 7, 1937, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and Japan launched the war again. This time, the National Government accepted the war. The beginning of the war was very unfavorable. Japan quickly occupied Beiping and Shanghai, and arrived in Nanjing in December. The National Government repeatedly moved its capital from Nanjing, and finally settled in Chongqing. From that time on, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party tried to cooperate for the second time, which lasted for eight years.

B. The United Front Agreement of 1937

In 1937, the CCP and the National Government reached a united front agreement, and issued a declaration on September 22 of the same year, guaranteeing the following four points:

(1) Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles are necessary for China today, and the Communist Party is willing to strive for their thorough realization.

(2) The Communist Party is willing to abandon the policy of armed resistance against the Kuomintang regime, the redization movement, and stop the policy of forcibly confiscating land.

(3) The Communist Party is willing to abolish the Soviet government, implement civil rights politics, in order to unify the national regime.

(4) The Communist Party is willing to abolish the name of the Red Army, reorganize it into the National Revolutionary Army, be under the jurisdiction of the Military Committee of the National Government, and be ready to dispatch troops to assume the responsibility of the front line of the War of Resistance.

Shortly after the agreement was reached, Mao Zedong made the following explanation to the CCP group: "The Sino-Japanese War is an excellent opportunity to develop our party. Our decision is 70% self-development, 20% compromise, and 10% fighting against Japan. In order to familiarize comrades with their tasks, so that they can still work towards a common goal even when they are cut off from headquarters, I am happy to point out the above policies to comrades."

Mao Zedong further explained that the united front policy would be advanced in three stages: "The first stage is to compromise with the Kuomintang in order to maintain our survival. The second stage is to strive for a balance of power with the Kuomintang. The third stage is to penetrate into the Central China region and establish a base in order to launch a counteroffensive against the Kuomintang and seize the leadership position of the Kuomintang."

In October 1937, the Political Bureau of the CCP passed a resolution on "The Future of the War of Resistance and the CCP's Policy," and at the same time explained the united front policy as follows:

"If the war is victorious, the strength of the Kuomintang army will be reduced to a minimum, and at the same time the strength of the Red Army will continue to expand... If the war is defeated, China will be divided into three parts: Japan will occupy the Northeast and North China; the Kuomintang will occupy the Southwest; and the Communist Party will occupy the Northwest. If the war is completely defeated, the Kuomintang will completely collapse, and the Communist Party will become an underground political party... In Chinese politics, force is the determining factor; therefore, we must do our best to expand our force during the war, so as to lay the foundation for seizing the position of revolutionary leader."

Perhaps some people think that the Communist Party's estimation of the value of the 1937 united front is too idealistic. But the result is obvious, and it really did not exceed the Communist Party's expectations. In 1935 and 1936, the CCP only controlled a small area within the scope of three provinces, and the army had only about 50,000 people. Before the end of the war, their power had expanded to be able to control more than 100 million people and possess 500,000 armed forces. At present, they have a well-equipped army of 1.5 million people.

At the beginning of the War of Resistance, a superficial unity could still be maintained. In 1937, with the consent of Chairman Chiang, the Communist Party organized a border area government in North China. In 1940, the Communist Party controlled parts of Shaanxi, Hebei, and Chahar provinces, established strong base areas, and conducted guerrilla tactics on the front and rear of the Japanese army. During this period, although the Communist Party neglected its violent social and economic policies, it did not abandon its basic Communist policies. Under the banner of nationalism and the War of Resistance, they strengthened their mass education work and aroused the patriotic sentiments of the masses to support the Red Army, which participated in the War of Resistance under the new name of the Eighth Route Army.

As the strength of the Communist army grew, it began to move beyond the designated areas, and from time to time, it clashed with the local authorities recognized by the Chongqing National Government. In December 1940, in the Yangtze River basin, the New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party had a large-scale armed conflict with the Kuomintang army. The central government ordered the arrest of the commander of the New Fourth Army and the disbandment of his army. Although more serious conflicts were avoided, the relationship between Chongqing and Yan'an deteriorated day by day. Political solutions were attempted several times, but all failed. Not only was the New Fourth Army not disbanded, but it continued to expand, as did the Eighth Route Army. The CCP's military and political power extended to most of the area north of the Yangtze River and behind the Japanese front line.

Under the situation of this united front, the CCP used clever strategies to make the two enemies fight each other, each suffering heavy losses, while their own strength was cultivated. The CCP's success in this regard was unmatched by any country or group in World War II.

C. New Democracy

Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Political Bureau of the CCP, published a booklet entitled "On New Democracy in China" in early 1940. This booklet is the most important document related to world communism published outside the Soviet Union since 1917. In this booklet, Mao Zedong described the Communist Party's policies under the conditions of the Second United Front in the most detailed way. At the same time, he provided the Kremlin with a program applicable to many other regions, which has been practically and effectively applied to various countries in Asia and Europe.

For eight years, most people who have studied Chinese communism have used this booklet as a blueprint. Anyone who is familiar with the development history of communist ideology and strategy should thoroughly understand its significance, but until now it has had little influence on various views on Chinese communism. Non-communist views on Chinese communism vary greatly, and there is no consensus. One school says it is merely Chinese rural liberalism, another says it is genuine Stalinism, and other schools hold various views in between.

In order to obtain the clear meaning of Mao Zedong's booklet, we must first give a summary of its content, then briefly describe the moderate interpretation, and then explain its significance to a trained communist member and our criticism of it.

First, he believes that the Chinese revolution may have a new paradigm. The Marxism of Europe in the 19th century advocated that the revolution must transition from a feudal system to capitalist democratic politics, followed by a revolution from capitalism to socialism. Mao Zedong acknowledged that China should also go through these two steps, but he believed that these two steps did not have to be completely separate, but could be merged into a continuous process, although there could be some static periods between the two.
