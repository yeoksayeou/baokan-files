The minutes of the 12th session, the Presidential election session, and the 13th session were read. The secretariat reported on congratulatory and leave requests. The presidium reported on (1) the official announcement of the Vice Presidential candidates according to the law, and (2) the Assembly will no longer accept petitions.

Then, the discussion of the proposals began. Because the review report of the first review committee was awaiting a decision from the presidium, it was not presented for discussion in the morning. The review reports of the second review committee, consisting of 44 cases, and the review report of the third review committee, consisting of personal cases, were smoothly passed before and after the break. There were only two speeches: one was a proposal to condemn the Communist Party via a telegram from the Assembly, calling on all compatriots to support the national policy of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, with Guo Hongqun from Hebei advocating for its passage and implementation by the Assembly; the other was a proposal to abolish the Sino-Soviet Aviation Treaty, with the original proposer, Yang Yongyi from Xinjiang, explaining the main points of the proposal.

As for the review report of the fourth review committee, consisting of 57 cases, after being read, due to time constraints, it was postponed for discussion in the afternoon. The session adjourned at 11:55 AM.

Important proposals passed in the morning related to national defense included: (1) thoroughly investigating the dereliction of duty by commanding officers during the retreat from Jilin; (2) simplifying anti-banditry agencies in various regions and strengthening their authority; (3) strengthening the jurisdiction and powers of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters; and (4) promptly dispatching a large army to rescue the critical situation in the Northeast. All were in accordance with the review opinions and recommended that the government earnestly implement them.

Those related to diplomacy included: (1) formally informing the Soviet Union in the name of the Assembly to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty and, upon its expiration, independently announce the abolition of the Yalta Agreement and the Sino-Soviet Treaty; and (2) determining the principles for a peace treaty with Japan. All were in accordance with the review opinions and were separately sent to the government for earnest implementation and adoption.

[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] The National Assembly continued its 14th session on the afternoon of the 21st. It was delayed until 3:53 PM, and the number of representatives present was still only 1,187, which was less than the legal quorum. It was changed to a discussion meeting, presided over by Shen Huilian, marking the first time a female representative has served as chair of the Assembly since its opening. After the meeting began, the review report of the fourth review committee, which had been read in the morning, was discussed. By 4:20 PM, the number of representatives present had reached 1,558, meeting the legal quorum. The Assembly was then reconvened, and the three cases that had already been discussed were ratified retroactively. Subsequently, the 57 cases in the review report of the fourth review committee were passed one by one. The review reports of the fifth and sixth review committees, totaling 189 cases, were read separately. The chair sought the Assembly's consent to pass them all without individual discussion. The passage was smooth and uneventful. Only in the review report of the sixth review committee, regarding cases related to rescuing youth, border regions, overseas Chinese education, as well as cultural and news undertakings, did the proposers make slight supplements or revisions to the review opinions. With the chair's consent, the Assembly agreed to the corrections. The session adjourned at 6:10 PM. In total, 298 proposals were passed throughout the day, which was considered very rapid.

Among the important cases passed in the afternoon, those concerning the national economy included: (1) formulating measures to requisition the capital of wealthy families within three months and implementing them earnestly; (2) fully implementing land reform; (3) exempting grain from business tax; and (4) establishing a currency reform committee to draft a currency reform plan as soon as possible.

### The National Assembly Suggests the Government Simplifies Bandit Suppression Agencies; The Proposal to Condemn the Communist Party via Telegram is Handed to the Presidium for Handling

[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] The National Assembly passed the "Proposal to Simplify Bandit Suppression Agencies in Various Regions and Strengthen Their Authority" on the morning of the 21st, suggesting that the government earnestly implement it. The main points of the measures are as follows: (1) Simplify the bandit suppression command structure. A unified bandit suppression command structure must be established in the bandit suppression area, and all duplicate agencies must be abolished. (2) Coordinate and strengthen local armed forces. In areas without bandits or where bandits have retreated, local security should be the responsibility of local militias. However, their organization and training must be strengthened in advance, their equipment must be replenished, and their security must be planned in advance to prevent them from being hijacked by bandits. (3) The central government should relax the scale of laws and regulations. Temporary emergency policies can be formulated in the bandit suppression area. (4) Civil officials in the bandit area, from the provincial chairman and mayor, and military officials from the army commander and commanders of military districts, are under the command of the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression. (5) The agencies and schools under the central ministries should cooperate with the decrees of the bandit suppression headquarters to perform their duties. If the person in charge is incompetent, the central government may be requested to replace them.

[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] The National Assembly passed a resolution on the morning of the 21st to condemn the Communist Party via telegram in the name of the Assembly and to call on all compatriots to support the national policy of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. The proposals were: (1) proposed by Gao Zhongqian and others: The Communist Party is creating chaos with soldiers, harming the country and the people. Please send a telegram to the whole country and the world to denounce and punish them, so as to expose their atrocities and launch a nationwide attack. The measures are: 1. Send a telegram to the whole country in the name of the Assembly to denounce them. 2. Send a telegram to the world in the name of the Assembly to expose the Communist Party's conspiracy and crimes, so as to avoid being deceived by the Communist Party's false propaganda and correct international perceptions. (2) Proposed by Gao Zhongqian and others: Please send a telegram to the whole country from this Assembly to call on all compatriots to unanimously support the national policy of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, step up the implementation of general mobilization, so as to quickly quell the rebellion and consolidate the foundation of the country. The measures are: 1. The Assembly shall resolve to hand it over to the future new government to continue to implement the national policy of suppressing the rebellion, so as to achieve complete success. 2. The Assembly shall send a telegram to call on all compatriots and overseas Chinese to continue to unanimously support the national policy of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, and step up the mobilization to suppress the rebellion, so as to quickly quell the rebellion and consolidate the foundation of the country. The Assembly decided to hand it over to the presidium for handling.

### Shaanxi Personnel Will Be Adjusted Immediately

The Executive Yuan Meeting May Make a Decision

[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] There will be personnel adjustments in Shaanxi Province. It is rumored that the authorities have already made an internal decision, and it is expected to be approved at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 22nd. The current Chairman of Shaanxi, Zhu Shaozhou, will be transferred to the position of Education Director of the Central Military Academy, and Guan Linzheng will succeed him as Chairman of Shaanxi. In addition, Hu Zongnan will be transferred to the position of Principal of the Central Military Academy, and Ma Hongkui will become the Commander-in-Chief of the Northwest Bandit Suppression.

### Grain Business Tax; Pan Gongzhan and Others Propose Exemption

The National Assembly Formally Approved Yesterday

[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] The "Proposal by Pan Gongzhan and 50 others requesting the National Government to issue a clear order to exempt grain from business tax, in order to maintain the people's food supply and alleviate the people's plight," was reviewed by the review committee and determined to be approved in principle, and sent to the government to instruct the competent authorities to earnestly implement it. It was approved by the Assembly on the 21st. The reasons for the proposal are that in this critical time of survival, if the people's food supply is not sufficient, the consequences will be unimaginable. Therefore, exempting grain tax is an essential plan to remedy the current difficulties. However, the provinces and cities have different opinions on this. Provinces such as Shandong and Sichuan advocate for a gradual collection, and Shanghai also believes that it should be exempted. Beiping, Guangzhou, Hangzhou and Hefei have also gradually exempted grain tax. The overlapping of grain taxation only increases grain prices and is more likely to affect social order. Two measures are proposed: (1) The National Government shall issue a clear order to permanently exempt grain from business tax. (2) The provincial and municipal governments shall not collect grain donations and taxes under any name.

### Currency Reform

The National Assembly Suggests Adopting the Gold Standard

[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] There are a total of four proposals related to currency reform submitted by the National Assembly. One is the "Proposal to Issue New Currency to Stabilize Finance" proposed by Wu Yizhi and 61 others. One is the "Proposal to Reform the Currency System Quickly, Stabilize Finance, and Stabilize People's Hearts" proposed by Mo Shaozhou and 32 others. One is the "Proposal that the Government's Economic Report Believes that the Fundamental Policy to Stabilize Prices and Replenish Military Expenditures Should First Reform the Currency System and Should Be Implemented Regularly" proposed by Song Yuanyuan and 40 others. One is the "Proposal to Quickly Reform the Currency System to Maintain the National Economy and People's Livelihood" proposed by Pei Hongyu and 25 others. After the review committee merged and reviewed the four proposals, it decided to approve them in principle and send them to the government to immediately establish a currency reform committee to draft a plan for implementation as soon as possible. It was passed by the Assembly on the 21st. The measures proposed in Wu's proposal are divided into two phases. In the first phase, the state will allocate materials worth 1.2 billion new currencies to form the National Construction Bank. The National Assembly will form a supervisory committee to be responsible for the custody and supervision of the bank's assets and the supervision of the printing and issuance of the new currency. All representatives of the National Assembly will be responsible for guaranteeing the validity of the new currency. The new currency will adopt the gold exchange standard, with new silver coins as the circulating chips (only banknotes will be issued in the first phase). That is, one new currency equals 100,000 legal currencies, and three new currencies equal one US dollar. 600 million new currencies will be used to recover more than 60 trillion legal currencies, and 600 million yuan will be used for the country to balance revenue and expenditure and for construction. In the second phase, 1.2 billion new silver coins will be issued. Once the coins are issued and cashed smoothly, the supervisory committee of the National Assembly will return them to the government for processing. Mo's proposal also believes that it should be changed to a gold coin as the standard and a silver coin as the auxiliary currency, and a fully convertible legal currency should be issued. Song's proposal only urged the government to promote currency reform as soon as possible to stabilize finance in a questioning manner.

### Requisitioning the Deposits of the Wealthy; Detailed Measures Listed in Three Proposals

[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] Regarding the issue of requisitioning the deposits of the wealthy, the National Assembly has three proposals: one proposed by He Foqing and 21 others, one proposed by Weng Cheng and 34 others, and one proposed by Long Wen and 37 others. After the fourth review committee merged and reviewed them, it decided to "approve them in principle and recommend that the government formulate measures within three months, earnestly implement them, and publicly report them." It was approved by the Assembly on the 21st. The measures proposed in the three proposals are listed approximately as follows: (1) In the name of the National Assembly, send a telegram to US President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall to announce the names and amounts of depositors in the United States, and immediately seal them up; (2) The National Assembly shall, in accordance with the teachings of the National Father on restricting capital, determine the maximum amount of capital for each person, and the excess part shall be confiscated by the government. If government officials possess excess funds, in addition to confiscation, they shall be handed over to the court for investigation and trial; (3) The Assembly shall set a principle and hand it over to the Legislative Yuan to formulate and implement the "Regulations on Investigating the Capital of the Wealthy" and "Collecting Special Donations from the Wealthy." The income shall be fully allocated to the refugee relief fund; (4) The Assembly shall authorize the Control Yuan to organize a requisition committee by the supervisors to investigate the deposits of the wealthy in domestic and foreign banks in many ways. If any are found, they shall be requisitioned for national use. All military and political expenses shall be paid from this, and the Executive Yuan shall order the governments of all provinces and counties to reduce or exempt other donations and taxes in addition to the land tax payable by the people.

### Sun Ke Discusses Sino-Soviet Relations; Vehemently Criticizes the Soviet Union for Not Fulfilling the Treaty; Reaffirms His Firm Stance on Giving Up His Legislative Yuan Qualification

[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] Sun Ke met with reporters at his residence at 5:00 PM on the 21st and made an unprecedentedly fierce criticism of the Soviet Union. He said: It is an undeniable fact that the Soviet Union is not fulfilling the treaty, and its excuse for difficulty that the war against Japan still exists is simply unreasonable. Mr. Sun appeared angered after hearing from reporters that a Soviet diplomat had commented that his remarks were unstable and did not believe that his election as vice president would benefit Sino-Soviet relations. He pointed out that after the fall of Anshan, most of the factory machinery had been dismantled and transported to Dalian and then to Vladivostok, accusing the Soviet Union of taking whatever it wanted in the Northeast, acting like a "robber." He did not give a direct answer to the question of whether he would still be willing to work hard to strengthen Sino-Soviet diplomacy and enhance friendship if he was elected vice president. He said: The situation is very clear. Everyone knows what the Northeast representatives of the National Assembly think of the Soviet Union. The future of Sino-Soviet relations depends on whether the Soviet Union has the sincerity to fulfill the treaty and coexist peacefully. He asked, if the positions of China and the Soviet Union were switched, what would the Soviet Union do? He believes that the crushing defeat of the Communist Party in the Italian general election can improve the situation in Western Europe and benefit reconstruction, but he is afraid that Italian society will be disturbed by the Communist Party's direct actions. The Communist Parties of the world are all centered on the Soviet Union, and they first use democracy as an excuse to win over the masses in various countries, but after failing in a regular way, they use any means. Our country's Communist bandits betray the country and create chaos, and they first eliminate resistance everywhere, and then implement policies by force. The government must guarantee the success of suppressing the rebellion with comprehensive political reform.

[Further dispatch] Sun Ke confirmed to reporters on the 21st that he had given up his qualification as a legislator. He said that although it is not yet time for the Legislative Yuan to elect the president, in order to avoid attacks from political enemies, he declared in advance that he would give up his election as a legislator to show his dedication to running for vice president. He also said that his decision to give up his qualification as a legislator will be maintained under any circumstances and will never be reversed. Regarding the constitutional amendment proposed by Zhang Zhiben and others that "National Assembly representatives exercise the rights of initiation and referendum on behalf of the people," he believes that there should be no doubt. The right of referendum is equivalent to a foreign plebiscite, but the right of initiation lacks precedent. The technical issue of how to exercise these two political rights needs to be studied.

### Yu Youren's Opinion on Women's Issues Published

Please Earnestly Protect Women's Rights and Interests

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Yu Youren, the president of the Control Yuan who is running for vice president, recently published an article "How to Solve the Problems of Chinese Women" to the women representatives of the National Assembly and the women of the whole country, expressing his opinions on the problems of Chinese women. The article is divided into three main points: the first is to solve the problem of women's employment, advocating that women must participate in actual administrative work and the work of various social departments, and the government should earnestly implement the relevant provisions on women's rights and interests after the implementation of the constitution; the second is to solve the problem of women's education, advocating the popularization of women's education, improving their cultural level, and cultivating women's professional talents; and the third is to solve the problem of women's economic problems, emphasizing women's economic freedom and establishing the principle of equal pay for equal work. The conclusion is that in China after the implementation of the constitution, women must demand full equality with men in all aspects of politics, education, economy, and society. It is heard that the women representatives of the National Assembly greatly admire President Yu's powerful statement.

### The Issue of a Permanent Organization

Fang Juehui chaired the meeting of the Presidium on the 21st and decided that Li Zonghuang and Hu Jingan would take turns as chairpersons of the Assembly on the 22nd morning and afternoon.

### The National Assembly Reviews the Economy

Representatives Attack the Work of the Fuel Management Committee

[Report from our Nanjing office, 21st] When the National Assembly held an economic review, the representatives strongly attacked the work of the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, especially because the price of coal distributed by the Fuel Management Committee was higher than that on the black market, and the surplus of the 36th year has not yet been handed over to the national treasury, which they were deeply dissatisfied with. Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian explained this when answering questions from the representatives on the 21st. Mr. Chen has admitted that the distribution price of Kailuan coal in Shanghai is much higher than the price delivered on ships in Qinhuangdao, but because each ton needs to be charged with railway security fees, Beining Road double-track repair fees, ship usage fees, and Shanghai terminal usage fees, totaling 2,716,000 yuan, the distribution price in Shanghai is 6,990,000 yuan. As for the surplus of more than 130 billion yuan of the Fuel Management Committee last year, Mr. Chen also admitted that it was correct, but said that it was used as a revolving fund for coal storage, so it has not yet been handed over to the national treasury.

### Zhang Junmai Sends a Telegram to the Chairman; Congratulating Him on His Election as President

[Central News Agency, this city] Zhang Junmai, chairman of the China Democratic Socialist Party, sent a telegram to congratulate Chairman Jiang on his election as President. The telegram read: "Nanjing Chairman Jiang Jian: On the day of the US presidential election, although the two parties competed with each other at the beginning, when the public opinion was revealed, the leaders of the opposition sent telegrams to the government, so as to clarify the purpose of starting a dispute and ending with concessions and obeying the majority. Your hard work and great achievements have led the people and the youth parties to give up nominating candidates, so as to promote your election with an overwhelming majority, which is enough to show the consensus of the psychology.

### Editorial: Future Borderland Policy

The Seventh Review Committee of the National Assembly held a full-day meeting on the 20th and continued to handle 34 proposals related to the borderlands, resolving to submit them to the government for consideration and implementation. The scope of the proposals is broad, covering borderland administration, the appointment of talented people from various ethnic groups, borderland policy, borderland economic development, as well as borderland education, borderland academic research, and investigation. The spirit of the various proposals is to have the government establish a borderland policy, using new political conduct and new facilities to promote the inward orientation of borderland compatriots and achieve the goal of national unity.

The representatives of this National Assembly came from the plateaus of Kangzang, Yunnan, and Guizhou, and from the deserts of Mongolia and Xinjiang, from the wild forests of Miaoling Mountain; in terms of ethnicity, there were Manchus, Mongols, Hui, Tibetans, Miao, Zhuang, Yao, and Gaoshan ethnic groups. This assembly united the Chinese nation into one family and gathered elites from the borderlands in one hall. The universality of the representatives can be said to be unprecedented. Especially at this critical time of national crisis, gathering borderland representatives to jointly discuss future borderland policy is of particularly profound significance. Although the National Assembly is not a decision-making body, the representatives' suggestive opinions do not necessarily have to be fully implemented by the government, but the gains from this once-in-a-millennium opportunity are truly valuable. The borderland representatives have come from thousands of miles away, bringing infinite hope and harboring infinite suffering in their hearts. Their proposals, their demands, and their voices should be given special attention. The Seventh Review Committee of the National Assembly, is an assembly dedicated to reviewing borderland policies and proposals from borderland representatives. The passage of 34 proposals, regardless of their different content and nature, each with its own rationale, content, profound significance, and great importance, the new government should attach importance to these proposals, extract the essence, and learn from each other's strengths to serve as a reference for deciding future borderland policies.

The so-called borderland policy, specifically speaking, refers to the ethnic, political, economic, and cultural issues of the remote provinces. China's borderland ethnic groups are distributed in the Northeast, Southeast, and Northwest. Geographically, some are separated by great rivers, mountains, and oceans, while others are vast and boundless deserts. Their languages, beliefs, customs, and habits are mostly different from those of the inland people. The development of their society and economy often stagnates in the early stages of agricultural economy. Their lives are special, and their culture is very backward. Under these circumstances, coupled with the improper borderland administration measures of past generations, they feel increasingly isolated, resulting in many barriers. Adding in the external factors in international relations, all issues have become increasingly complex and serious. Therefore, the future borderland policy must first prevent external factors in order to protect itself. Secondly, it must seek internal reform to promote the progress of borderland politics and economy, guide social customs, culture, and education to exchange with the inland as much as possible, and gradually move towards the grand goal of the Chinese nation as one family.

External factors reflected in borderland issues include the Outer Mongolia issue after the founding of the Republic of China, the Northeast issue before the Anti-Japanese War, and the current Xinjiang issue. Their border disputes and ethnic conflicts are all reflections of external factors. From a geopolitical perspective, the growing tip of the ethnic forces of neighboring countries is advancing towards our border. Whether by relying on military force, exerting political pressure, mixing in immigration means, or even using the mutual attraction of people of the same ethnicity, the goal is nothing more than to make the tip of its ethnic forces grow and extend directly into China's territory, while China's peaceful and buffer zone is shrinking inward. Any independent country has its border issues. If the growing tip of the ethnic forces of neighboring countries develops directly towards the country, the country must establish an independent and autonomous borderland policy in national defense and politics to prevent the deepening of external forces, in order to protect itself and for a sense of security. China's border connects with the territory of neighboring countries for thousands of miles. In order to live in peace, in order to protect ourselves, or in order to prevent our ethnic groups from being attracted by foreign races, we should establish proactive ethnic policies and national defense security policies. Article 13 of the basic national policy in the new Constitution stipulates that "The national defense of the Republic of China shall be aimed at safeguarding national security and maintaining world peace." The so-called national security is borderland security; to strengthen national defense, we must first strengthen border defense. Without borderland security, the peace of a country loses its guarantee. In order to maintain world peace, we must first protect borderland security. We hope that future borderland policy should take protecting borderland security as its first goal.

Secondly, regarding the reform of the borderland political and economic system, the improvement of social customs, and the communication of culture and education, it is necessary to entrust them to wise politicians to implement with progressive and enlightened policies in the future. The Soviet Union's administration of ethnic minorities is managed by first-class politicians; Japan's former colonial administration was managed by outstanding figures in the country. In the future, China's borderland administration should be based on the principle of selecting excellent talents from the borderlands at the local level, and the principle of having first-class politicians in charge of borderland affairs at the central level. As for policy programs, Article 168 of the new Constitution stipulates: "The State shall accord legal protection to the status of the various ethnic groups in the border regions and shall give special assistance to their local self-government undertakings." This is to implement equal policies in politics and ethnicity in the borderlands. Article 169 stipulates: "The State shall actively undertake and assist in the development of education, culture, communications, irrigation, sanitation, and other economic and social enterprises for the various ethnic groups in the border regions. The use of land shall be protected and developed according to the climate, soil properties, and living habits of the people." This is a progressive policy specially formulated for the border provinces, using the power of the state to help the borderlands progress and develop, which is very different from the past policies of appeasement and leniency. We hope that future borderland policies should be thoroughly implemented in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution, not only guaranteeing the close unity and unification of domestic ethnic groups, but also guaranteeing the completion of the Three Principles of the People and the national revolution.

Today's Chinese era is an era of the Chinese nation as one family, and it is the beginning of a new era for the borderlands. The new Constitution has established the principles of borderland policy, and the borderland representatives of the National Assembly have contributed concrete opinions. The question now is how to implement and carry out this policy. Finally, we want to awaken the nation's attention to the borderlands and assist the government and borderland compatriots in implementing the new borderland policy.

### Zhang Zhizhong Sends Letter to Ili Side Urging Clear Stance; Liu Mengchun Discusses Current Situation in Xinjiang

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 21st] Liu Mengchun, Secretary-General of the Northwest Headquarters, recently met with a reporter from the Central News Agency and commented on the current situation in Xinjiang: "We can only examine our own shortcomings and work practically. It is difficult to predict the results we will achieve. However, the stability and various practical progress in the seven districts today can be considered a testament to the success of our policies over the past two years." Regarding the Ili issue, he said: "General Zhang Zhizhong has sent a letter to the Ili side, urging them to clearly state their stance on three issues: (1) changing the special status of the three districts, (2) reorganizing the Ili army, and (3) deploying the National Army to the border areas. This letter has been delivered to the Ili side, but there has been no response." However, Liu emphasized the key to this issue, saying: "We are seeking a path to peace and stability based on our established policies and correct principles. If the Ili side repeatedly falls into errors and fails to extricate itself, then we cannot be held responsible for their errors." He believes that the Xinjiang issue today is whether the Ili side is willing to fulfill the peace terms, not who is in charge. Therefore, it is difficult to make other considerations before the basic policies are sincerely implemented by the Ili side. Liu also informed those concerned about the situation in Xinjiang: "Overemphasizing the other side is a sign of weakness. Today, we should strive to make progress on our own. There is no other way to follow, and there is nothing to worry about."

### National Assembly Chronicle: A Trickle in a Torrent

[Our Newspaper Special Feature] Being in the conference hall on the 21st made one feel insignificant. The 8560 proposals came like a vast flood, overwhelming and leaving people unable to read them all, unable to focus on them all, and unable to hear them all. The conference hall was noisy all morning, like the scene before a movie screening. Secretary-General Hong: "Proposal No. ×× submitted by Representative ×× and ×× others: Subject... Examination opinion..." Chairman Xue: "Do the representatives have any objections to the examination opinion on this proposal?..." This kind of report continued until 12 o'clock, when the examination reports of the first batch of 52 national defense and foreign affairs proposals handled by the second and third examination committees were all passed; however, by the time the meeting adjourned, a quarter of the representatives had already left the conference hall.

The afternoon was even worse: Didn't people like the Xuanwu Lake, Linggu Temple, and the Mausoleum in spring...? Therefore, the huge conference hall seemed deserted. The general assembly was originally scheduled to continue at 3 PM, but at 3:53 PM there were still only 1187 people present. Since the number of attending representatives did not meet the quorum, the first female chairman, Shen Huilian, announced that a discussion meeting would be held instead, conducting an informal discussion on the examination report of the fourth examination committee regarding economic proposals. Unexpectedly, the discussion immediately bogged down on the proposal to "Implement land to the tiller within a limited time and immediately levy progressive property tax..." He Guangju from Shaanxi and Li Hongru from the labor union both opposed doing such important things within six months, believing that the time limit would probably become a mere formality due to reality; therefore, the conveners Zhu Ping and Gao Xin provided explanations and amended opinions. Chairman Shen said, "Let's vote." Someone shouted, "There is no quorum." Chairman Shen came up with a solution despite the lack of a quorum: "How about we conduct a hypothetical vote?" Coincidentally, the number of attending representatives suddenly increased to 1558, which was enough for a quorum; Secretary-General Hong and Chairman Shen quickly changed the announcement to change back to a general assembly, and the hypothetical vote became a formal vote, and the amended opinions were all rejected. The only difference from the morning was that there were two representatives below the stage who were familiar with the process and chanted "No objection" in a loud voice, but by the time the first batch of 57 economic proposals were all passed, Chairman Shen was already panting.

The reporter read through the 73 social security proposals from the fifth examination committee in one breath. Only Chairman Shen, Deputy Secretary-General Que, and Deputy Director Yang of the Secretariat were left on the stage, and there were still more than 600 people below the stage supporting the event. The tired Chairman Shen said, "In order to save time, how about we ask everyone for their consent on the report just read as a whole? Are there any objections?" Unexpectedly, a female representative, Hu Kuisheng, came out and said that the wording of the examination opinion on a certain proposal was inappropriate. Chairman Shen quickly said, "I'm sorry, please don't speak anymore. How about supplementing a written amendment? Thank you, thank you!" The plea was finally effective. The 116 education and culture proposals from the sixth examination committee were read through quickly and passed as a whole, but someone who requested to speak raised an accusation from the balcony: "Why doesn't the chairman allow people to speak?" Chairman Shen repeatedly said "I wouldn't dare." Hong Lanyou and Cui Xinyi hurriedly invited Wang Yizhou from Hubei and Lin Zigui from Fujian to express their opinions on education and culture cases, and made several wording modifications to the examination report. As 6 o'clock approached, there were less than 200 people in the audience. Most people had already read all the advertisements in the evening newspaper and stood up ready to run. Chairman Shen anxiously waved her hands repeatedly, saying "Thank you," "I'm sorry, please wait a moment!" She hurried to end the meeting in two steps, declaring the meeting adjourned. At this time, the representatives claiming their paychecks in the lounge and the representatives hosting the event in the cafe also hurriedly picked up their bags and walked out of the hall, got on the transportation vehicle to go to the banquet. Each vice-presidential candidate and cadres were also about to leave their lively campaign headquarters, once again smiling and bowing: "Please give me a vote!"

It would take at least three or four days to read through all 800 proposals. The representatives all have their own interests. What should be argued and what should be debated has already been argued and debated in the examination committee. The general assembly is just going through the procedures according to the agenda. In addition to thinking about how to establish a permanent institution after the meeting and whether the committee members will be paid, there is only the matter of voting for the vice president. Moreover, this is just spring, so how can one blame the few representatives? (April 21st, Nanjing)

### Official Announcement of the Italian General Election Results; The Government Party Controls Parliament; Shifting Attention to Preventing Communist Incitement of Disorder

[Our Newspaper] London, 21st, Radio: Rome news, Interior Minister Scelba announced that the Christian Democratic Party has won an absolute majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives of the new parliament. However, observers believe that the majority in the Senate is only relative. When making this announcement, Scelba apparently did not take into account the 107 honorary senators who had been decided before the election.

[Reuters, Rome, 21st] The Ministry of the Interior announced the final official results of the Senate election. The Christian Democratic Party received a total of 10,741,131 votes, accounting for 47.9% of the total. The People's Front received 6,955,229 votes, accounting for 31%. The Senate has a total of 344 senators, of which 107 are appointed in recognition of their contributions to the Republic, and the remaining 237 are elected in this election. According to the vote count, the Christian Democratic Party is expected to win 116 to 118 seats, the People's Front is expected to win 75 to 77 seats, the Social Unity Party is expected to win 12 to 14 seats, the National Bloc Party is expected to win 12 to 14 seats, the Republican Party won seven seats, the Monarchist Party five seats, the Italian Social Movement two seats, and independents two seats. Among the designated senators, the Christian Democratic Party occupies 18 seats, so the party can win a total of 134 to 136 seats in the Senate.

In the House of Representatives election, according to the latest figures, the Christian Democratic Party has won 9,554,614 votes, accounting for 48.5% of the total, only 1.5% away from an absolute majority of over half. The People's Front won 6,330,614 votes, accounting for 32.1% of the total. The House of Representatives has a total of 574 members, all of whom are elected. Based on the known vote count, the Christian Democratic Party has won 274 to 279 seats, which is expected to be at least 70 seats more than the party had in the Constituent Assembly. Based on the known figures, the People's Front can win 194 to 196 seats. It is expected that after the final results are announced, the number of seats held by the People's Front in the House of Representatives will be equal to the number it held in the Constituent Assembly. The Social Unity Party is estimated to win 40 to 41 seats, the National Bloc Party is estimated to win 17 to 20 seats, the Republican Party 14 to 16 seats, the Monarchist Party 12 to 13 seats, the Italian Social Movement 10 to 11 seats, and others are estimated to win five seats.

[United Press, Rome, 21st] With the Italian government confident of an election victory, it has shifted its attention to preventing possible Communist disturbances and large-scale unrest centered in the northern industrial areas. Fighter planes and ground troops have been dispatched to investigate mountainous areas where left-wing elements are concentrated. The government has also ordered a ban on Communist Party rallies on Sundays. At the same time, it announced that there would be a military parade in Milan on that day to celebrate the anniversary of Italy's liberation from Axis rule.

[United Press, Rome, 21st] Just as the Italian election situation was being revealed and the whole country was taking a breath, riots broke out again in the north and south on the 21st. In the Foggia region of southern Italy, communists held a large demonstration to protest the government's election "fraud". Military police were dispatched to disperse the ranks with tear gas. The unrest started last night and has not stopped this morning, with ten people injured. In the Milan area, two more armories were attacked, and one soldier was injured. The Milan military stated that the military police in Milan and Genoa have been ordered to be on alert and the situation is "tense."

### The Italian People's Front Falters; The Left-Wing Socialist Party Will Inevitably Split Again

[United Press, Rome, 21st] The People's Front, composed of the Communist Party, the Left-Wing Socialist Party, and the Labor Democratic Party, has begun to collapse due to its disastrous defeat in the election. Six leaders of the Left-Wing Socialist Party, led by former Interior Minister Romita, have demanded that the leader of the Socialist Party, Nenni, withdraw the party from the Left-Wing Alliance. They have threatened to split the party for the third time. Nenni joined the pro-communist alliance in January 1947 and has split twice since then. Saragat, the current leader of the Independent Socialist Party, was the first to withdraw from the party, and two months later, Lombardo, the most admired leader of the Socialist Party at home and abroad, also announced his withdrawal.

Romita and the other six claimed that they had informed Nenni that they would hold a meeting next Sunday to decide on the policy of "restoring the party's independence." Political observers believe that the six will not withdraw from the party immediately, but if Nenni firmly refuses to break away from the alliance with the Communist Party, the Socialist Party will inevitably split. This move will obviously weaken the strength of the Communist group in parliament, as a number of newly elected members of the Left-Wing Socialist Party will inevitably withdraw.

[Reuters, Rome, 21st] Togliatti, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Communist Party, known as the "military leader" of the Italian Communist Party, told reporters in Milan today that he feared that the relationship between the government and the people would soon enter a dangerous state of tension. The election results do not indicate the end of the Communist Party, but only a slight setback in the Communist Party's plans. Communist Party members in Rome are showing embarrassment over the election results. Judging from the reactions of the Communist Party and left-wing elements, the European Communist Parties participating in the Communist Information Bureau do not seem to have agreed on a way to take joint action. The Communist Party newspaper stated that the number of votes won by the Italian Communist Party this time has increased by 18.5% compared to 1946.

### The Italian Communist Party Suffers a Major Blow; Washington Expresses Satisfaction

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th, United Press] US officials believe that the great victory won by the anti-communist faction in Italy in this election is the most severe blow to the Soviet Union and international communism in the "Cold War." Some people believe that the blow to the Communist Party from the results of this Italian election is greater than the Marshall Plan for European aid. This choice by the Italian people will strengthen the strength of anti-communists around the world. Amidst the increasing power of the Communist Party, South Korea, Austria, Greece, Germany, Turkey, Iran, the Middle East, Scandinavia, and Latin American countries will be affected by this election.

### Good Reactions in London and Paris

[Reuters, London, 20th] London political figures, except for the Communist Party, unanimously felt satisfied with the results of the Italian election. Sir Anthony Eden, a member of Churchill's "shadow cabinet", stated that this phenomenon is extremely beneficial to the Western European Union and represents the common faith in Christianity, spiritual freedom, and justice of Western European countries. Crossman, a leader of the left-wing of the Labor Party, said that although the defeat of the Communist Party is necessary for the reconstruction of Western Europe, we cannot regard Gasperi's victory as a victory for Britain. The task ahead is to truly help the Italian people establish a social environment in which a truly democratic social movement can grow.

[Reuters, Paris, 20th] The French Popular Republican Party today sent a telegram to the Italian Christian Democratic Party congratulating it on its successful election campaign. Prime Minister Schuman told Reuters reporters that "France and Italy have a common culture and common aspirations. The victory of the Italian Christian Democratic Party symbolizes peace between the two countries and pleasant cooperation between the two countries." The conservative "Le Monde" believes that Togliatti's most serious mistake was attacking the Vatican and irreparably offending the religious feelings of the Italian people.

### Six-Nation Conference Discusses Forming a West German Government; The United States Prepares to Draft a Plan

[Reuters, London, 20th] As the six nations of Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg resumed discussions on the German question in London on the 20th, the United States' decision to draft a plan for the establishment of a West German government within the next twelve months was the key factor in the meeting. Well-informed political figures believe that after the end of this London conference, the division of Germany will be temporarily completed. The main issue facing this conference is when the occupying powers of West Germany, after consulting with the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, will take the next step in organizing West Germany.

### International Monetary Fund Suspends Payment of Foreign Exchange to Recipient Countries

[Reuters, Washington, 20th] The International Monetary Fund resolved today to suspend the advance payment of foreign exchange to beneficiaries under the Marshall Plan.

### Churchill Calls on Europe to Unite to Defend Freedom

[Associated Press, London, 21st] Former wartime Prime Minister Churchill declared today that Europe will not be able to have lasting peace as long as Asians, imperialism, and communists rule Central and Eastern Europe. Unless the people of Europe unite to preserve their freedom, culture, and civilization based on Christian ethics, there will be no hope for the world.

### The United States Promotes Anti-Communist Strategies; Paying Emergency Funds to Achieve Political Goals

[United Press, Washington, 21st] The United States' secret anti-communist plan, "Project X", is now underway. Congressional sources recently revealed that the United States spent approximately $4 million in Italy for "political purposes". It was also stated that funds to support anti-communist groups behind the Iron Curtain will be allocated continuously. Senator Bridges, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has consistently supported "Project X" in Congress. It is understood that each department in the United States has an "emergency fund". The funds for this anti-communist strategy are paid under the emergency fund after being approved by Congress and government officials.

### British Navy and Air Force Conduct Naval Exercises in the North Sea; To Be Held in Mid-May

The participants will include two battleships, one aircraft carrier, one cruiser, eleven destroyers, four second-class cruisers, ten submarines, and approximately 135 aircraft.

### US Predicts Results of Pyongyang Conference; Will Establish a Unified Korean Government; Kim Koo and Kim Kyu-sik to Serve as President and Speaker Respectively

[United Press, Seoul, 21st] Pyongyang Radio broadcast today that Kim Koo, the leader of the Freedom Party in South Korea, has arrived in Pyongyang to participate in the national unity conference initiated by the North. Another anti-communist leader from South Korea, Kim Kyu-sik, led his entourage of twenty people and departed despite his illness and will arrive soon. At the same time, it was reported here that Kim Koo stated before his departure that if the Pyongyang conference failed, he would commit suicide by disembowelment at the 38th parallel border between the US and Soviet occupied zones. US military authorities predict two possible outcomes of the Pyongyang conference: (1) Pass a constitution, announce the establishment of a unified Korean government, with Kim Koo as President and Kim Kyu-sik as Speaker, and request that the United States and the Soviet Union withdraw their troops simultaneously; (2) Send Kim Koo and Kim Kyu-sik back to the South to request that the general election scheduled for May 10th be postponed indefinitely. The South Korean leaders may therefore appeal to politicians from the North and South to continue holding meetings.

[British Information Service, London, 20th] The Chinese delegation to the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information, which recently participated in Geneva, will take the opportunity to examine the British news industry and visit the British Broadcasting Corporation.

[Reuters, Geneva, 20th] The plenary session of the 55-nation Conference on Freedom of Information recently passed a resolution by a vote of 30 to 7, with two abstentions, to establish a 12-member Subcommittee on Freedom of Information.

At the end of the three-year period, the subcommittee will decide whether to establish a permanent World Council on Freedom of Information to succeed its mission.

### Twenty-Five Japanese War Criminals, Half to be Hanged

[New Asia Agency Tokyo, 21st] The Tokyo Military Tribunal has begun its final stage of proceedings since the morning of the 19th, holding deliberation conferences to determine the guilt or innocence of each war criminal. The scope of these deliberations includes twenty-five defendants, including Tojo. This deliberation conference is composed of thirty judges from eleven countries.

[United Press Washington, 20th] The Far East International Tribunal's trial of Japanese war criminals has come to an end. Experts here predict that approximately half of the twenty-five defendants will be sentenced to death by hanging. Another ten or so will be sentenced to various levels of imprisonment.

The fate of Hata Shunroku, former commander of the Central China Expeditionary Army, is uncertain; he will likely be sentenced to imprisonment. Those expected to be acquitted include former Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru, former Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army Umezu, and former Finance Minister Kaya. Those sentenced to imprisonment will include former Army Minister General Minami Jiro and former commander of the Central China Expeditionary Army Matsui.

### Former Japanese Prime Minister, Mitsumasa Yonai Passes Away

[All-People's News Agency Tokyo, 21st] Former Japanese Prime Minister Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai passed away on the 21st at his residence in Tokyo from pneumonia that developed into a brain ulcer. He was 67 years old. Yonai served as Naval Minister in the Suzuki Cabinet, the same cabinet that surrendered to the Allied forces in August 1945. Yonai assumed the position of Naval Minister in January 1940 and resigned in July of the same year due to his opposition to the Army's demand to conclude the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy.

### New Chemical Element Produced From Radium Tablets

[United Press Chicago, 21st] Dr. Hagvar, of the Chicago Argonne National Laboratory, announced to the American Chemical Society today that a rare, radioactive element called actinium, number 89 on the periodic table, is now being produced from radium tablets. It has been fifty years since the world learned of the existence of elements in nature when French scientist Debierne discovered it from pitchblende and iron metals in 1898. However, its quantity was too small to concentrate. This time, it has been extracted separately, made into a free state, and shaped like table salt.

### U.S. Army Department Manufactures Powerful Rocket Launcher

Capable of circling the Earth in half an hour

[French News Agency Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, 20th] Kant, the chief engineer of the Ballistics Department at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, told this agency's reporter that the U.S. Army Technical Department is now capable of manufacturing a rocket launcher that can circle the Earth in 30 minutes. However, the cost of manufacturing such a rocket launcher is equivalent to that of manufacturing an atomic bomb. Kant also said that the firepower of the rocket launcher manufactured by the United States is twice as powerful as the German V-2 rocket, with a range of approximately 650 kilometers.

### British Death Row Inmate, Sentence Commuted to Life Imprisonment

The judge did not wear the black cap that should be worn when sentencing to death.

### Opposition to the U.S. Trusteeship Plan for the Holy Land at the United Nations General Assembly - British Forces Order Evacuation of Haifa Port

[United Press Lake Success, 21st] Large and small countries within the United Nations unanimously opposed the United States' trusteeship plan for Palestine on the 21st, threatening the plan with premature demise. In addition to the Soviet Union and countries within the Soviet bloc, the opposition also includes countries that have traditionally been friendly to the United States. The UN Political and Security Committee is scheduled to meet again at 10:45 a.m. on the 21st to address the Palestinian issue. It is expected that several Latin American countries will also rise in opposition to the U.S. plan.

Delegates to the General Assembly are increasingly feeling that the United States will be unable to garner enough votes to pass the trusteeship plan and abandon the partition plan. U.S. officials acknowledge that the future is bleak.

[Central News Agency Lake Success, 20th] As the United Nations General Assembly began its main debate today, the United States and the Soviet Union clashed again over the future of Palestine. Shortly after U.S. representative Austin proposed his trusteeship plan for the Holy Land, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko immediately rose to speak, stating that the Soviet Union "cannot accept" the U.S. proposal. Gromyko continued to declare his support for the General Assembly's original plan to divide the Holy Land into a Jewish state and an Arab state, and strongly attacked the United States' proposal to abandon the partition plan. Gromyko accused the United States of advocating changes to the original plan because it coveted the region's oil and military interests, and that powerful elements in the United States intended to transform Palestine into a U.S. military base and economic "semi-colony." On the day the United Nations Special Assembly began debating the fundamental nature of Palestine, the United States was also condemned by representatives from countries other than the Soviet Union. New Zealand representative Berendsen made a poignant plea to the General Assembly, calling for the need to return to the Holy Land's partition plan and formulate methods for implementing it. Berendsen warned against allowing the United Nations to suffer an irreparable and tragic blow by succumbing to the world's intimidation and violence. Representatives from Australia and Sweden also unanimously expressed agreement with the New Zealand representative.

[United Press Haifa, 21st] British authorities effectively abandoned the key port of Haifa entirely on the afternoon of the 21st. Except for the headquarters on Mount Carmel and a small garrison on the road between the port area and the mountain, troops have been withdrawn from all other locations. A British spokesman admitted that this action was tantamount to an "open invitation" for Jewish and Arab forces to fight for control of the port.

### Chairman Inquires About Situation in Shanghai, Summons Du Yuesheng and Qian Xinzhi, Encourages Them to Lead All Sectors in Cooperating with Government Economic Measures

[This Newspaper Nanjing, 21st] Chairman Chiang summoned Shanghai representatives Du Yuesheng and Qian Xinzhi at his official residence at 4:30 PM on the 21st to inquire about the security and economic situation in Shanghai. In addition to reporting in detail, Du and Qian made the following requests: (1) The conscription of 6,000 young men in Shanghai this time. Request approval to train them into a guard brigade to protect local security instead of transferring them elsewhere. (2) Hope that the central government will pay attention to the refugee problem, make overall arrangements for resettlement, and ensure social order. Du and Qian then expressed their opinions on economic policies, hoping that the competent authorities would act cautiously, not change orders from morning to evening, and avoid lighthearted experimentation, such as the past announcement of cotton cloth control without prior notice of preparation, which not only lost the government's credibility but also missed the opportunity to snap up raw cotton. Recently, the sudden prohibition of securities delivery has caused some hot money to lose control, increasing the threat of price increases. It seems that the authorities have not given careful consideration in advance. The Chairman nodded frequently and said: He is confident in suppressing the military chaos, but he hopes that Du and Qian will offer their opinions at any time on economic measures and lead the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors to cooperate closely with the government. After talking for about an hour, Du and Qian then excused themselves.

### Will Public Utility Prices Rise Again? Broadly Involved Issues May Become Clear by the End of the Month

[Report from This Newspaper] Regarding the issue of stabilizing public utility prices, the Municipal Council telegraphed the central government to restore the subsidy policy, but no reply has been received to date. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has been in frequent contact with the Central Bank and the Fuel Management Committee in recent days to reduce the price of oil and coal raw materials. According to Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau: The municipal government has made its best efforts, and the Public Utilities Bureau has done its best to reduce prices and maintain continuous operations. Regarding the issue of early settlement of foreign exchange for oil use, the municipal government has submitted a detailed report to the Central Bank, and President Zhang has agreed to this principle, but technical aspects remain to be discussed. The amount involved requires a decision from the Central Bank because it involves foreign exchange. The issue of loans and advances depends on the economic situation of each utility company and requires the Central Bank to decide based on the actual situation. Whether public utility prices will rise again in May cannot be determined at this time. If the central government provides subsidies and assistance, the problem can be solved; otherwise, instructions will be requested from the central government, and there will definitely be a solution. Furthermore, the prices for May need to be reasonably determined after considering the cost of living index and general price levels to be released at the end of this month. Regarding the handling of this issue, I am in close contact with the Mayor at all times and hope that the Central Bank will provide assistance within its capabilities to help resolve it. The final handling plan may become clear by the end of the month.

### Taking Back the French Concession Water and Electricity Company - Sufficient Exchange of Views Still Needed

You will choose the most suitable candidate for the country and for President Chiang. We are confident that you will share the same sentiment as our association."

### City Government Officials Accused of Corruption - High Court Reverses Original Verdict, Orders Retrial - Believes Original Verdict Did Not Give Defendant an Opportunity to Defend Themselves - Sun Qinchi's Case Not Fully Investigated

[Report from This Newspaper] Former Director of the General Affairs Department of the Municipal Government, Sun Qinchi, Section Chief of the Affairs Section Shen Zhenjia, and Clerk of the Affairs Section Shen Wenyuan, were previously accused of embezzling and engaging in corruption by receiving oil stored by the enemy camp, Zhonghua Izumitsu Kogyo Co., Ltd. The District Court sentenced Sun Qinchi to not guilty, and Shen Zhenjia and Shen Wenyuan to three years and six months of imprisonment each for corruption. Shen and others disagreed with the verdict and filed an appeal with the High Court. The High Court ruled yesterday that "the original verdict is revoked and remanded to the Shanghai District Court for retrial." The reasons for the retrial are approximately four points: (1) The original verdict lacked procedural integrity because the defendant was not given an opportunity to defend himself. (2) According to the appellant's defense, he was only initially assigned to investigate whether Izumitsu had any stored oil. The removal of the oil after it was concentrated was the responsibility of other employees. (3) A shortage of oil amounting to a huge 72,458 gallons was investigated. With such a huge amount, how could it be carried out and sold without anyone knowing? (4) Director of the General Affairs Department Sun Qinchi has a supervisory responsibility. The original verdict did not mention whether he had protected it or failed to report it, but only said that there was no evidence, and hastily acquitted him. This was not a thorough investigation."

### Acquittal Followed by Detention: Wen Guangting Finally Released; Xinshi Street Police Station Issues a Statement Regarding the Handling of the Case

[Report from our newspaper] Wen Guangting, a technician at the Hu Xinghua Foundry, was accused of robbery and theft. After being acquitted by the District Court, he remained in custody due to bail issues. Yesterday, the District Court issued a release order, placing him in the custody of the Hu Xinghua Foundry. He was released from the Sinan Road Detention Center at approximately 1:00 PM yesterday.

[Further Report] Regarding Wen Guangting's accusation while detained at the Sinan Road Detention Center to the Human Rights Protection Committee of the Municipal Council that Zhao Baosheng, a volunteer policeman at the Xinshi Street Police Precinct, had subjected him to torture during interrogation, including punching and kicking, and allegations involving collusion and bribery between the local court's bailiff and judge, reporters visited Wang Zhaoxin, the chief of the Xinshi Street Police Precinct, and Liu Lianfang, the chief of the Criminal Investigation Division, yesterday to understand the truth of the case and inquire about the details. According to their account: "At 10:00 PM on January 13th, Du Shu'en, an officer of the Criminal Investigation Division, supervised officers Qu Yuxuan, Zhu Chanzhang, and Du Shufan, along with volunteer policemen Zhao Baosheng and Tang Taosheng, on patrol on Huangxing Road within their jurisdiction. Late at night, they discovered a dark figure. Volunteer policeman Zhao Baosheng quickly apprehended the person, who identified himself as Wen Guangting. A triangular, sharp knife, about five inches long, was found on his person. When asked where he was going, he only said he was visiting a friend in Jiangwan and lived in the Hu Xinghua Foundry at 314 Qipu Road, and gave evasive answers to further questioning, so he was taken to the station for further interrogation. He then confessed to having conspired with the fugitive Jin Xinsheng in three robberies and one burglary, specifically: (1) Around midnight on December 15, 1936, they attempted to rob a young woman near the small vegetable market at the intersection of Wusong Road, but fled when a street policeman approached. (2) At about 10:00 PM on the 27th of the same month, they robbed a woman at the barbed wire fence at Baoshan Road and Qiujiang Road, stealing two gold rings. (3) At 8:00 PM on January 12th of this year, they robbed a female passenger on Huangxing Road, obtaining a gold ring and 100,000 yuan in cash. (4) They broke into the back door of Zhu Qiaobao's house at 604 Kunming Road and stole a Western-style stove, a foot basin, and a pair of overshoes. Subsequently, the victims were summoned to the station, where they identified and claimed their stolen goods. Inquiries were also made at the Hu Xinghua Factory on Qipu Road regarding whether a worker named Wen Guangting was employed there. It was reported that while such a person existed, he had been dismissed a week before his arrest due to his unsatisfactory conduct. Later, his accomplice, Jin Xinsheng, was apprehended at the back building of 1110 Changshou Road and interrogated jointly. He also confessed to the robberies and burglary along with Wen. Officer Du also escorted Wen to the aforementioned locations to demonstrate the robbery of the young woman and the snatching of the gold rings. Now, this criminal is exceptionally cunning, stating in his letter to the Municipal Council that the item found in the paper package was a kitchen knife, while the weapon the precinct presented to the court was in fact a triangular, sharp knife. This is indeed verifiable. The precinct believes the crime is factual and charged him with aggravated robbery, submitting the case to the court for trial, and there is nothing inappropriate about it. As for allegations that he was placed on the tiger bench during interrogation and had cold water poured into his nostrils, there are no such facilities here, and a thorough investigation can be conducted."

### Surveyors Head to Build the Shengshan Fishing Port

The Sisle Islands are the center of the fishing industry in southeastern China. Every year during the yellow croaker and ribbonfish season, over 10,000 fishing boats from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian gather there. During normal times, fishing boats seek shelter from the wind at Xiangzi’ao in Shengshan or Sizhoutang. Neither of these ports has any protection. In the event of strong northwest winds, ships in Xiangzi’ao must flee to Sizhoutang, and vice versa. In the event of strong southeast winds, ships in Sizhoutang must flee to Xiangzi’ao. The ships must pass through Sanjiao Port, where hidden reefs are spread across the port, and fishing boats often collide or sink due to running aground.

### Cotton Yarn That Does Not Meet Export Standards: Decision to Exchange with Factories for Cloth for Export

According to a recent message from the Textile Export Committee, to promote the export of yarn and cloth and support small and medium-sized textile factories in the Su, Xi, Cheng, and Chang areas, the committee has decided to exchange yarn that does not meet export standards with cloth from various factories that meets certain standards. The cloth will then be stamped with a unified trademark before being exported. The detailed measures are currently being drafted by the committee's secretary. Once approved, they will be formally implemented.

It is expected that once these measures are officially implemented, not only will various factories be able to obtain a supply of raw cotton, but the export of cloth will also be greatly increased, which will be beneficial for earning foreign exchange.

In addition, to strengthen ties with various parts of Southeast Asia and to obtain information and expand exports, the committee has decided to establish an office in Hong Kong to report news at any time and facilitate business contacts.

Since the Textile Export Committee decided to adopt a dynamic review method for the cotton yarn-to-imported cotton exchange ratio, a total of 21,345 bales of imported cotton have been exchanged, with 5,281 pieces of cotton yarn and 73,129 bolts of cloth to be exported.

### Yarn Market Initially Weak, Later Firm; Cotton Cloth Sales Not Robust

Yesterday, the yarn market was initially weak but later firmed up, resulting in mixed fortunes. At the opening, it continued the previous day's sluggish trend, hovering at lower levels. 42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 232 million, and 21-count Double Horse opened from the 150 million mark. Subsequently, rumors of the opening of yarn and cloth transportation to the south boosted market sentiment for a time. However, as actual sales in the local market remained stagnant and out-of-town sales remained slow, prices lacked the strength to rise. By closing time, prices had fallen back down. The former closed at 234 million, down another 1 million. Except for Blue Phoenix, which rose slightly by 1 million, other 40-count yarns continued to fall by 1 million. The latter, due to slight absorption by out-of-town merchants, rebounded to close at 155 million, up 4 million. Except for Golden Rooster and Red Kui Xing, which saw slight price drops, all grades of 20-count yarn rebounded by varying amounts, from 1 million to 5 million. Supply and demand for all grades of 16-count yarn were balanced, with a stable trend and few changes.

The cotton cloth market entered a consolidation phase yesterday. Hankou merchants only purchased small quantities of bleached cloth and Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji. Supply of Shilin cloth and dyed cloth from dyeing factories remained scarce, showing a slight briskness. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 4.98 million, once reaching 5.02 million, and closed at 4.92 million.

Current Cotton Weak

Yesterday, the current cotton market trend turned weak. The Flower Management Committee showed signs of loosening up, offering low prices, and many were eager to sell, leading to a weak market. Furthermore, due to sluggish actual sales of yarn and cloth and a slight price decline, sentiment became increasingly unsustainable. Therefore, cargo owners no longer raised prices, with each grade falling by about 100,000 compared to the previous day. 550 bales were traded. German cotton opened at 26 million, Shashi at 24 million, and Huoji at 18.4 million, all prices for delivery to the public treasury. The price of Zhoupu seed cotton remained unchanged.

### Rayon Market Weakens

Yesterday, the rayon market continued to weaken due to oversupply. 120-count Asahi Gloss opened in the morning, falling to around 230 million. The midday spot price was sold at 29 million, and the afternoon closing price was 30.05 million, down 5 million from the previous day.

Filament Silk

Yesterday, the market remained quite firm. High-grade retail opened at 365 million, mid-grade retail was within the 60 million range, and Grade C was bid at 80 million, with a counter-offer of 75 million that was not traded. The dry silk market was very quiet, and the market remained firm.

Silk Fabrics

The market declined yesterday. Huaqiang Real Silk Bed Covers opened in the morning, falling to around 146 million, and then continued to decline, with the spot closing price at 44.5 million. Dacheng Checkered Bi Crepe closed at 535,000. Rayon fabrics were weak yesterday. Hua Jin Crepe, ordinary goods, saw transactions within the 170,000 range, while real silk goods remained firm.

### Commercial News from Various Locations

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch on the 21st] Grain prices here plummeted by more than 500,000 yuan in a single day yesterday, and prices of all commodities generally softened. Furthermore, Mr. Sen Sheng, director of the Guangzhou office of the China-America Relief Mission, recently stated that the rice distribution situation in Guangzhou is progressing well.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 21st] The silk market in Hangzhou was weak today, with Hangzhou silk falling sharply by 30 million. Silk fabrics also declined across the board, but the decline was not significant. Rice prices saw mixed gains and losses, with gains exceeding losses.

### Trade with Japan in Arrears; China Trust Issues Statement

Mr. Tang Juesheng, representative of the Trade Group of our delegation to Japan, stated in Japan that the main reason for the near-stalemate in Sino-Japanese trade is that the Central Trust Bureau's arrears in barter accounts with Japan have not been cleared, and there is a suggestion to allocate part of the debt to Japan's war reparations to China. Yesterday, the person in charge of the China Trust Bureau issued a special statement to defend the bureau. It is claimed that: (1) The Bureau's handling of barter trade with Japan and private trade with Japan are independent of each other and have been conducted separately from the beginning. When the government opened private trade with Japan, the Bureau suggested that the government separate private trade accounts. Therefore, the Bureau's barter accounts will definitely not hinder private trade. (2) The Bureau owes the Japanese side a total of 10 million US dollars in barter trade. The Bureau is actively transporting domestic goods to Japan for repayment. At present, the goods waiting to be transported are worth at least 1 million US dollars and are being shipped one after another. The person in charge solemnly stated that owing the Japanese side money is not a disgraceful matter, because when barter trade began, the Japanese side owed the Bureau a considerable amount. Moreover, the victorious countries in the war against Japan could first take loans and then use the loans to offset the debt. This has long been stipulated. Therefore, the debt is purely a matter between the two parties in barter trade and has nothing to do with ordinary trade. (3) The Bureau has no intention of allocating the debt to Japan's war reparations to China. So far, it has not made any recommendations to the government, nor has it made any requests to the Allied Headquarters.

### Weak Sales, Oversupply; Rice Market Slightly Declines; Flour, Grain, Oil Cakes All Soften

Yesterday, the rice market was generally weak. The South Market was stable, while the North Market fell by 50,000 yuan. In the South Market, prices initially rose by 100,000 yuan due to the rise in Wuxi prices the previous day. However, the market then turned from strong to weak due to a lack of demand. Cargo owners wanted to sell but lacked buyers, and prices retreated midway, eventually closing at roughly the same price as the previous day, or even slightly weaker. Only White Yuan goods were in short supply and rose by 100,000 yuan. In the North Market, Japonica rice, thin rice, and Indica rice all fell by 50,000 yuan due to weak sales. White Yuan and special high-grade Japonica rice remained firm. A total of 5,593 shi of goods arrived. The People's Adjustment Committee continued to sell white rice in the North Market, but there was little demand.

Flour re-entered a weak state, due to the fact that merchants had ceased buying again and prices in Suzhou and Wuxi were weak. Sellers felt very uncertain, and successively sold off. As there were neither wholesale purchases nor many retail purchases, supply exceeded demand, and prices gradually fell. Military ship flour fell from 1.42 million to 1.4 million at closing. Old Cart retreated into the 1.4 million range, falling by 30,000 and 45,000 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng both fell by 30,000. Bran retreated by 30,000 yuan, and wheat mill prices increased by 20,000, to 2.07 million yuan.

Coarse grains mostly declined. Merchants did not buy yellow soybeans, and prices fell by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Sales of picked green beans in the local market became sluggish, falling by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Qingdao reported a rise in corn, and Qing merchants bought more high-priced goods, raising prices by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Low-priced goods remained stable, and red sorghum was firm, rising by 30,000. Merchants stopped buying mung beans, and prices fell by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were potentially very firm, rising by 100,000 to 200,000. Peanut sellers saw a surge in supply, and prices fell by another 100,000 yuan.

Edible oil fell sharply, because raw material prices were low, and all grains showed weakness. Sellers felt uncertain and sold off a lot. Oil factories opened at high prices, with abundant supply. Da You and Da Chang Xin Soybean Oil Factory opened at 8.6 million, but later repurchased transactions were shorter. The lowest Tong Sheng Tai Soybean Oil was 8.45 million, a drop of about 300,000. Actual sales of raw oil were not high, and prices fell sharply by 30,000 to 40,000. Clear oil and vegetable oil also fell. Merchants did not buy soybean cakes, and prices followed the oil market, falling sharply by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Fluctuates Narrowly

The foreign-operated tea market, which mainly exports Ping Shui Pearl Tea, has seen no clear transactions since the stalemate in the purchase negotiations, and the market sentiment has repeatedly changed. Transactions in other varieties are also very narrow, and the market lacks change. As for domestic tea, all kinds of aged tea remain firm amidst empty inventories. As for this year's new Longjing tea, it is still arriving in batches from the source, and the quality is deteriorating day by day, making it increasingly difficult to maintain prices. At closing, prices were lowered again compared to before. According to industry insiders, Biluochun, produced in Dongting Mountain, is also a famous and expensive domestic tea. The new goods for this year are gradually approaching the picking season and are expected to arrive in Shanghai soon.

### Sugar Market Consolidates and Weakens

Yesterday, the sugar market generally consolidated and weakened. The association set the price of current spot 24 crude white sugar at 5.55 million initially, then down to 4.43 million, then back up to 5.5 million, a decrease of 180,000. High-quality four-and-a-half white sugar fell from 6.5 million to 3.35 million, and burlap bags fell from 6.4 million to 3.26 million. 24 fine granulated sugar was relatively tight, at 5.6 million to 5.65 million. 20 medium-grade white sand, good quality, was at 5.35 million to 5.25 million, a decrease of slightly more than 100,000. High-quality blended red sugar was at 5.34 million.

Warehouse receipt trading: the initial price of the 16th period was 70,000, at 1.05 million, then back to 1.09 million, then down to 1.06 million. The afternoon was 1.1 million to 1.12 million, down 20,000. The 17th period was initially low and then tightened, first falling from 430,000 to 380,000, then consolidating to 520,000.

### Spare His Life!

— Wu Yong

In the early days of victory, the Central Bank opened foreign exchange and stipulated that there was an unlimited supply. The currency value relied on stability, price fluctuations were reduced, and there was a sign of decline. At that time, many celebrities and giants, seeing that the goods in their hands were intangibly depreciating and the people were finally able to breathe, advocated a "high price policy" under the pretext of "protecting national industry and commerce." This was echoed by others, and the hype was extremely noisy. In the past two years, prices have risen steadily, step by step. Although this was prompted by the general trend, it may not be entirely due to the promotion of these people, but the fact is that the lives of ordinary people have become more and more difficult, while the wealth of these people has accumulated more and more. Today, the "high price policy" can be said to have been completed. However, in recent months, prices, although still inevitably experiencing twists and turns, seem to be slightly more stable than before. I am sincerely afraid that the public opinion against the rising winds, after being provoked and incited by those with ulterior motives, will once again change and advocate the "high price policy." This is not the author's oversensitivity, in fact, some people are already uneasy and are issuing the high-sounding argument that "rising prices are really not good, and falling prices are not good either." Once the US loan is effectively utilized and prices show a slight downward trend, it is expected that the "high price" theorists will launch an offensive. At that time, in order to avoid the decline in commodity prices, these people will at least spread such grand theories as "the economy should seek stability."

According to reason, if rising prices are not good, then falling prices should be called good. Falling prices mean that the legal currency appreciates and purchasing power increases. The proponents of stability are simply trying to prolong their lives, so that the goods they have hoarded remain at their original value, and they are trying to rise again. A general decline in prices has no initial impact on manufacturers, because the cost of raw materials and wages is also reduced at the same time; those who are hit are only the hoarding class who sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor, and those who benefit are ordinary people who trust the legal currency. Therefore, there is no one among the common people who does not hope for prices to fall, while the proponents of high prices would prefer to freeze the index and have prices adjust dynamically at any time.

Today, the whole country is vigorously advocating democratic politics. I think that if we want to achieve political democracy, we must first seek economic democracy. Fortunately, the decision-making authorities should give priority to the interests of the majority of the people, and do not rush to purchase in the market when rice prices or other commodity prices show a slight downward trend, just when they are about to return to the prices of more than ten days before the rising winds, and act as a pillar in the middle stream, as if turning the tide when it is about to collapse. Please do not do this, please.

### A Brief Talk on Ink

— Banmeng Laoren

I bought a piece of purple ink from Ling Xiaohan Pavilion with the words "Man grinds ink, ink grinds man" on it, and I sighed at the pedantry. In fact, the ink that is used for grinding is definitely not good ink, and ink does not grind people either. People get old because they get old, what does it have to do with ink!

According to ancient times, lacquer was used for writing, and in ancient times, graphite was used for writing, and in later generations, smoke ink was used for writing. Since the invention of smoke ink, there have been various schools of ink making, such as Wei Zhongjiang, Ji Gong, the Zu family, Li Chao, Li Tinggui, and the Pan Gu family, who have continued to make progress. During the Six Dynasties, there was no one better than Zhang Yong, and during the Five Dynasties, there was no one better than Huan Chao. Xi Chao's son, Li Tinggui (who was given the surname Li during the Southern Tang Dynasty), made smoke ink that would not spoil even after being placed in water for three years, and was known as a divine product among inks. Later, Su Haoran made ink, all with pine patterns and wrinkled skin, as firm as jade. During the reign of Emperor Zhangzong of the Jin Dynasty, Suhe oil was used to collect smoke to make ink, and the price of ink was the same as that of gold.

After the Six Dynasties, there were Li Chengan, Li Wenyong, Chen Yun, Sheng Hao and others, who made ink that was similar to Tinggui and was also a divine product among inks. The ink used by Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty was called Longxiangji. One day, he saw a small Taoist priest walking on the ink like a fly. Emperor Xuanzong scolded him, and he shouted "Long live!" and said, "I am the essence of ink, the Black Pine Messenger." This is inevitably close to mythology. However, the books of the Jin and Tang dynasties and the paintings of the Song and Yuan dynasties have been passed down for hundreds of years, and the ink color is like lacquer, and the spirit is pure and complete, which cannot be compared with later works. The ancients said that the beauty of ink lies in its light quality, the smoke is taken for its clarity, it has no fragrance when smelled, and it is silent when ground, which is the best quality. During the Xuanhe period of the Song Dynasty, Li Tinggui's ink was more expensive than gold. Gold could be obtained, but Li's ink could not be obtained.

During the Wanli and Tianqi periods of the Ming Dynasty, the most famous ink makers were Cheng Junfang, Fang Yulu, and Wu Quchen, who were the best. They shone one after another with Fang Zheng, Shao Gezhi, Luo Xiaohua and others, until Cheng Yongxiu. However, the ancients used pine coal, and later used tung oil smoke. Deer glue was also rarely used, and beef glue was used instead. The quality has declined and is far inferior to that of the ancients.

Generally speaking, the best ink must be light in quality and heavy in glue, and the color must be as black as lacquer and emit light. Painting and writing can be of spiritual assistance. In the past, Dong Qichang of Huating paid the most attention to the use of ink. He specially hired famous ink craftsmen to make it at home. The selected smoke was particularly fine, and the infiltrated glue was particularly shiny, so his paintings and calligraphy have been passed down for thousands of years, and the color is still undiminished. When Qing Wang Lutai painted, he would not write lightly without top smoke. The ancients paid attention to the use of ink.

When I was in Beiping, Yuan Juesheng of Changzhou had the most ink collections and wrote the "Zhongzhou Ink Collection Record". At that time, he was regarded as a giant among ink collectors. However, Yuan's calligraphy was very good, and his ink usage was also ordinary. His daughters were all able to paint landscapes, but were not famous. It can be seen that Yuan's main purpose was to collect ancient ink, and he did not study whether the ink was good or bad. Now that Yuan has passed away, I don't know where his ink collection has gone, and no one can understand it. Collectors enjoy themselves for a while, while calligraphers and painters are passed down for thousands of years. Both are precious and good ink, but they cannot be compared.

History records that "During the Tang Dynasty, Feng Sheng and Lu Qi met on the road, each carrying a bag. Qi opened Sheng's bag and found an ink stick, and laughed loudly. Sheng said sternly: 'This is coal from Tiandu Peak, mixed with the brain of the needlefish, and made in the hands of Jin Huozi. It can be used to record ancient copies of "Lisao". Comparing it to your daily extraction of 300 pieces of silk, being a slave to fame and profit, which is more important!' Then he searched Qi's bag, and it was indeed three hundred thorns." From this, it can be seen that collecting ink is better than running around in the field of fame and profit.

### Wait a Minute [Don't Give]

— Yi Jun

When people are so poor that they become beggars, although they are social parasites and are most contemptible, we humans are ultimately compassionate and cannot watch them starve to death. Therefore, when we encounter beggars, especially the disabled, old, young, and children, we have to do good deeds and spend a few banknotes.

The causes of beggary are not entirely due to laziness. In times of peace and prosperity, it is mostly due to low intelligence. In times of frequent wars, I don't know how many beggars are created by artillery fire. We, who are fortunate enough not to become beggars, if we don't give them a little food to eat, wouldn't they have no other choice but to die? Hard-hearted people don't care, the death of a beggar is equal to the death of a dog, but soft-hearted people are sad even when a dog dies, let alone a person?

If everyone does not give beggars money, there may be two consequences: one is to return to nature - starvation; the other is to take risks - be forced to become pickpockets, thieves, and even bandits. I believe that an ideal society should first seek to have no thieves, and then seek to have no beggars. Allowing beggars to eke out a living may prevent them from becoming thieves. If we don't leave beggars a way out, we will be forcing them to Liangshan.

The newspaper on the 18th reported that in order to prevent Shanghai from becoming a "city of beggars," some people have planned to unite celebrities from all walks of life to initiate and promote the "Don't Give Movement." And it is rumored that: "These beggars can earn two to three hundred thousand yuan a day by begging, and their income is so good that it is astonishing." It sounds really astonishing, but I doubt it. It is unlikely that beggars have such good income. Although this suspicion has no scientific basis, where is the definitive proof of that rumor?

If such a luxurious, wealthy, beautiful, and happy Shanghai becomes a "city of beggars," it would indeed "hinder the city's appearance and also affect public health and social order." The question is how to turn beggars into non-beggars, and prevent non-beggars from becoming beggars. Before the problem is solved, it would be best to delay the launch of the "Don't Give Movement."

### On the Virtue of Wine

— Qian Dacheng

Liu Ling's "Ode to the Virtue of Wine" certainly praises wine to the extreme. Meng Dongye's "Poem on the Virtue of Wine" says: "Wine is an ancient mirror, revealing the hearts of villains. When drunk, you see strange actions, when drunk, you hear strange sounds; the merits of wine are so many, and the shortcomings of wine are also deep. Wine can exempt criminals from punishment, and this can be used as a warning." This is indeed very true. Drinking and playing cards with people often reveals a person's true temper and nature from a small action. Especially after getting drunk, people who are usually silent will talk more; people who appear gentle and refined will also be rude and reckless. The ancients said: "Wine can confuse nature." In fact, wine is the most capable of revealing people's true nature, and it is indeed a mirror of the human heart. There are many people who intentionally do not drink alcohol, even though they also love alcohol very much. Yan Baiyun said it well: "Traitors often don't drink, their hearts are like mountains and valleys. They hook out drunken words and pretend to be friendly. How poisonous is this heart! Don't talk to them when drinking."

I am a drunkard, happy to have a cup in my hand. After getting drunk, I sing and laugh wildly, and open my heart to people. Once, as a result of laughing wildly, my jaw dislocated. Now it has become a problem, and I often have to dislocate it if I'm not careful. However, I have met several close friends in wine who can share weal and woe. However, in order to drink more, my body is getting weaker day by day; after getting drunk, I have offended many people with my wild words. Several times I have been "hooked" and fallen into a "horse trap," to the point of "being abandoned by everyone," and unable to recover. However, I am still fascinated by the "thing in the cup." The wine itself is good, and it is wonderful, I only blame myself for not being able to control it well. But it's terrible if it is used by "traitors." It is still an obvious evil to use sleeping pills, and experienced people can identify it at a glance: "Pretending to be friendly" is really terrible, not only will it take your life and property, but it will also ruin your reputation. It is lovely to scold people while drunk, and it is mostly a person of temperament. So I say: "Wine is a thing of emotion, and tobacco is a thing of reason." You see, people who are used to scheming are often inseparable from tobacco; the pillow skills of opium smokers are even more terrible. So I always praise wine, even though I am now too sick to drink it.

"The merits of wine are so many, and the shortcomings of wine are also deep." I praise wine, and I complain for wine.

### Yu Temple

— Sanmu

Clamping the river, the Yue King's capital stands tall, the red walls and Chongtang have been around for half a kalpa, the grass on the jade steps grows long with the remnants of armor (temporary station of demobilized youth army), the inscriptions on the stone tablet are plowed by wild men; the mountains and rivers contribute to the world, and the patrols are often hoped for at the beginning, looking as far as the floating clouds laboriously north, the Yellow River has become a canal today!

From Yu riding a boat to visit Xiaoyunxi, climbing Nen Yunlou, the day is already late

Outside of the tender cloud den, the evening clouds cover, a desolate cold presses the edge of the water, the kalpa has not yet ended, the monks have failed, the tower is idle, and ten thousand plum blossoms are killed.

### Children's Village

— Mao Yi

In the foothills near Qu Loujing in Switzerland, there is a small village of 50,000 square yards, scattered with twenty-four red pine thatched huts. Each house is inhabited by a group of orphans of different nationalities. This is Bertarosi's Children's Village. The greatest purpose of the Children's Village is not only to provide physical nutrition to orphans who have suffered the ravages of war, but also to nourish their souls and enable them to understand peace and love between people.

The birth of the Children's Village is the realization of a dream. In the summer of 1944, Walter Robert Cauty, the editor of a Swiss monthly magazine, wrote an editorial calling for the establishment of a refuge for the world's war orphans.

The response surprised Cauty. Thousands of letters filled with money and suggestions came in. He organized a "Children's Village Association" and consulted several architects, educators, and psychologists before the plan was realized.

After the address was selected, Swiss children raised donations in the streets and alleys to build the Children's Village. Two young brothers donated their shoe-shining income. Students sacrificed their holidays to saw wood. Seven hundred workers did 80,000 hours of work voluntarily.

Twenty-four houses were built. The height of the furniture, stairs, windows and door handles are all designed to be suitable for children to use. Each house can accommodate sixteen children, and is cared for by one "father" and one "mother."

French children who used to work underground learned that they could live without riots. A little girl from Germany no longer wakes up in the middle of the night calling for her parents who have already died. Polish children who once vowed not to live under the same sky as the Hungarians are now making friends with their "enemies."

The greatest achievement of the Children's Village is to calm down the war orphans who are still traumatized and sow the seeds of "world unity" in their hearts.

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

Few people are normal, most people are a mixture of genius, mentally retarded, and mentally ill patients.

Some people are dead, but their names are still alive; some people are not dead, but their names have already died.

It's really miserable when people can't laugh and cry as they please - but, in fact, people are really that miserable.

There are thorns everywhere without the rose, and there are roses without thorns, but you can't find them anywhere

Nervousness and dullness are all the same, all the same neurasthenia.

People say that plants and trees are emotionless, but they forget the tear marks on the spotted bamboo, the red beans planted with Acacia, and the bitterness of the lotus seeds, and the connection of the lotus roots...

Many people treat endurance as enjoyment; there are also more people who treat enjoyment as endurance.

### Su Dongpo's Jade Belt

— Xiao Peng

This newspaper reported that in this fire at Jinshan Temple, the ancient sites of the temple, such as the Zhou Ding, Zhuge bronze drums, and Su Dongpo's jade belt, were spared, which is also fortunate. There is an interesting story about the Wang belt left by Dongpo in the past, which is described as follows:

Originally, the abbot of Jinshan Temple in the Song Dynasty was Zen Master Foyin, who was Dongpo's friend in the Buddhist community. When Dongpo went to Hangzhou, he passed by Runzhou (Zhenjiang) and stayed at Jinshan Temple for a few months. One day, Foyin hung a sign and led his disciples into the room. Dongpo entered the abbot's room to see him in plain clothes. Foyin said, "Where did the Minister come from? There is no place to sit here." Dongpo joked, "I will borrow the four elements of the monk to use as a meditation bed." Foyin said, "This monk has a turning phrase. If the Minister answers immediately, I will grant your request. If you hesitate even a little, I would like to leave the jade belt you are wearing to suppress the mountain gate." Dongpo agreed, and took off his jade belt and stepped on the chair. Foyin said, "This monk's four elements are originally empty, and the five aggregates are non-existent. Where does the Minister want to sit?" Dongpo hesitated and did not answer immediately. Foyin hurriedly called to the attendant, "Take this jade belt and suppress the mountain gate forever." Dongpo laughed and gave it to him. Foyin took a cassock skirt to repay him, and there were two quatrains. Dongpo answered in the same rhyme, with the lines: "Sick bones can't bear the jade belt around them, and dull roots still fall into the machine of arrow tips. Wanting to teach the begging prostitutes to the singing courtyard, I deliberately gave the old cassock of Yunshan." Reading this, one can imagine the humor of old man Po in those years. Now that this jade belt has not been affected by the disaster, it can indeed suppress the mountain gate forever.

### Ling

Reading the newspaper, besides the "Miss China" beauty pageant, there is also a "Miss China Queen" Ms. Wu Yungele. This kind of lively event also belongs to the European style. In the past, there were many reports of "Philippine Queen Elected," "Paris Queen Crowned," and so on. As for the selection of queens in various cities and schools, it is the same meaning but different name as selecting city flowers and school flowers. However, the Chinese "后" (hòu, queen) and the Western "Queen" have similarities and differences, which can easily cause doubts. In the past, after the selection of the "school queen" at a university in the western suburbs of Peiping (Beijing), many male students joked and called themselves "emperors." Although it was a game, the meaning of the word became clearer, so it cannot be left unsaid.

The ancient meaning of the word "后" (hòu) is the monarch, the ruler of the body, what is called "后者後也" (hòu zhě hòu yě, the ruler is the successor), which originally did not belong to women. It is repeatedly seen in the "Book of Documents" and the "Book of Changes," as well as various classics, and this was the case before the Xia and Shang dynasties. It was only during the Zhou dynasty that "后" (hòu) began to refer to the spouse of the emperor. (Before this, the emperor's wife was only called 妃 (fēi, concubine), meaning "mate.") Then there was the empress (皇后, huánghòu) as a match for the emperor, and the empress dowager (皇太后, huángtàihòu) on par with the retired emperor (太上皇, tàishànghuáng).

As the master of the palace, below her were concubines (妃, fēi), consorts (嬪, pín), noble ladies (貴人, guìrén), etc., who faced north to serve her, just as princes and dukes were subjects to the emperor. Even the emperor's close uncles and brothers, although honored as princes, were still subordinates to the empress. Therefore, the empress was still one with the emperor. However, no matter what, she was always a married woman, never deviating from the idea of "a wife is honored by her husband" and "the husband is the foundation of the wife," without the qualification to be independently respected.

The Western "Queen" is different. Although she is a woman and paired with a "King," although the King's wife is called Queen, the Queen's husband does not necessarily have to be a King. Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth of England were both rulers of their country, not Queens because of a King. In addition, the husbands of the female rulers of countries such as the Netherlands cannot consider themselves Kings simply because their wives are Queens. Also, during World War I, Wilhelm of Germany ravaged Northern Europe. The Netherlands was spared, and the cable translation said that it was because the Dutch Queen's consort was German and was able to use his connections to mediate. The term "駙馬" (fùmǎ, imperial consort) used here is also borrowed from Chinese and is very forced. The Queen's husband is certainly not an emperor or an "imperial consort"; he can only be given the title he deserves based on his own position.

In Chinese history, the so-called "female rulers," even if they held great power and ruled the country for many years, such as Wu Zetian of the Tang Dynasty and Empress Dowager Cixi of the Qing Dynasty, were all elevated because their husbands were emperors. Although Wu Zetian established the "Zhou Dynasty" and changed the title of "hòu" (后, queen) to "dì" (帝, emperor), it was fundamentally different from the Western Queen. The Japanese imperial family's titles largely follow the Chinese system, but women are also given the title of "Prince" (王, wáng) (with the ranks of 内親王 (naishinnō, imperial princess) and 女王 (joō, princess)). Their imperial house rules stipulate that when the emperor is vacant, the regent should first be the crown prince and princes of various ranks. If there are no male candidates who have reached the age and qualifications, it is the turn of the imperial princess, then the princess, then the empress, and finally the empress dowager. Although there is this written rule, there is definitely no such fact. In Chinese history, when the emperor was absent, there would be an "old Buddha empress dowager" who would either listen to politics behind a curtain or command everything without doubt. The daughters of the emperor could only be called princesses and had no qualifications to ask about national affairs. Japanese imperial princesses and princesses, although they cannot formally inherit the throne, have a "regency" clause (with the order being above the empress, valuing bloodline over marital status), and their nature is between the Western Queen and the Chinese princess.

Whether it is a city queen, a school queen, or an association queen, to avoid misunderstandings, it is better to translate it as "Queen."

The two most famous "Queens" of England are both related to the era-defining prosperity of the world's strongest country. Elizabeth, with her unparalleled beauty, reigned supreme, and the country was prosperous, with all industries flourishing. Great writers such as Shakespeare, Bacon, and Spenser all made their names in this era, and poetry, drama, and science all flourished. During Victoria's reign, the country's power was particularly strong, from the King of England to the Emperor of India (Empress), creating a new era for Great Britain's founding and expansion of national power. Therefore, the Western custom of selecting flowers and queens in general also has the symbol of prosperity and strength, and is not just for a temporary excitement and liveliness. This meaning should also be understood.

Legal Translation Doubts

Old Affair from Thirty Years Ago: Question about Housing Redemption

Sun Xianjun asks: I have several legal questions. Please answer them, I would be grateful. (1) I received a mortgage on a house from a certain family in the second year of the Republic of China (1913). The mortgage contract did not specify a time limit. If, according to the Civil Code, the mortgagor's right to redeem expires after 30 years from the expiration of the mortgage, I wonder if the eight years during the War of Resistance should be deducted? (2) The lower half of the rent receipt book obtained with the contract was damaged during the war. Fortunately, the upper half of the rent receipt book, which contains notes, is still intact. Under such circumstances, I wonder if it will be deemed that the document has defects and is invalid?

[Answer from Legal Advisor Mr. Tang Mingshi]

(1) The outbreak of the War of Resistance caused different times of fall of different places, and the obstruction of the exercise of legal rights also varied, so it cannot be generally calculated as eight years. If judicial power cannot be exercised, it is indeed a reason. However, the circumstances must be proven, such as whether both parties were in the same location and whether there was a clear expression of redemption? Did the mortgagee refuse? Etc., cannot be generalized. (2) To examine evidence, you must look at the original object, which cannot be measured. If it is incomplete, it is a defect. However, evidence with defects does not mean that it has no evidentiary power at all.

### Husband Died in a Foreign Land: Drifting in a Different Place

A Reader Submits a Letter Seeking Mother and Younger Brother

Editor: Xiuyun is originally from Yuliang, She County, Anhui. During the War of Resistance, she followed her husband and moved to the interior. News of her family has been cut off for five years. Unfortunately, her husband died in a foreign land, leading to her drifting in a different place. Recently, she received a letter from her hometown, learning that her loving mother and younger brother left with her brother-in-law Tang Jizhong, who held a military position, during the war. However, after many inquiries, there is still no trace of them. I have long admired your newspaper's circulation throughout the country. If you could disclose this information, the effect would be significant. For this reason, I am writing this special letter, hoping for your sympathy and assistance. If there are any fellow villagers or kind gentlemen who know the whereabouts of Tang Zixian from Anhui and Tang Jizhong from Sichuan, I earnestly request that you send a letter to inform us, so that we can reunite the family. I am deeply grateful. Yours sincerely, Tang Xiuyun, Tiānhòu Temple, Ningbo, Zhejiang.
