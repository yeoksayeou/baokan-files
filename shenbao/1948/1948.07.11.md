When Zhang Qun met with representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party in Shanghai last month, he discussed the possibility of party members of the two parties serving as mayors, but it is difficult to predict how this will develop in the future. As for the automatic concession of seats by Kuomintang legislators to increase the number of seats for the two parties, Chen Bulei consulted with Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke after returning to Nanjing, and there will be concrete results in the coming days.

They stated that yesterday's student actions went beyond the scope and specifically involved the highest authorities in North China, and the situation was indeed serious. However, after inquiring with students from various schools in the Northeast, they learned that the Northeastern students went to mourn the dead students, and the subsequent development into a march was beyond their expectations. The representatives solemnly declared that the Northeast and North China were interdependent, and the fact that students from the Northeast came to Beiping amidst the chaos of war was an expression of their love and trust in Commander-in-Chief Fu. They then presented two requests to Fu: (1) Who fired the shots in the unfortunate July 5th incident? Who ordered the shooting? Please thoroughly investigate and publicize the findings to clarify the truth and appease the students' emotions. (2) The Ministry of Education issued orders to establish temporary universities and temporary middle schools in Beiping, but preparations have been slow. Please assist Commander-in-Chief Fu in finding school buildings so that Northeastern students in Beiping have a place to live and study. Fu promised to handle the first request cautiously and to do his best to assist with the second request.

One Cannot Be Without Enemies in Politics

Lincoln and Gandhi are examples." Fu declined to comment further on the July 5th incident, other than the written statement he issued previously. Fu then reiterated his remarks at the Army Day Commemoration Meeting, saying: "This war is not an ordinary change of dynasty or government, but a struggle between two different ways of life. If everyone chooses a way of life with national independence, civil rights, freedom, and people's happiness, they must grasp the overall goal and not pay too much attention to local phenomena."

### Beiping Security Authorities Announce Strict Enforcement of Martial Law

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 10th] Beiping City security authorities told reporters, "After the Northeastern students gathered and destroyed the City Council and surrounded the Vice President's residence to petition on July 5th, they were manipulated by treacherous bandits, intending to create a tragedy, disrupt the anti-rebellion and bandit suppression efforts in the city, and carry out acts of violence to disturb social order, which led to the unfortunate incident in which military police and students were injured in Dongjiaominxiang. The evolution of this incident to date has proven that it was a planned action from the beginning, manipulated and instigated by treacherous bandits, and not simply a matter of Northeastern refugee students seeking education and food. Therefore, today's incident can be said to be a battle launched by treacherous bandits in the city to resist bandit suppression and anti-rebellion efforts." Finally, the security authorities stated the meaning of declaring temporary martial law: "Before martial law is lifted, the local highest military commander and the city's security authorities will strictly enforce martial law to facilitate bandit suppression and anti-rebellion efforts and to maintain the city's security."

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 10th] The Supervisory Yuan convened one discussion meeting after the recess. Since the President's convocation of a meeting of the three Yuan presidents to discuss the Supervisory Yuan's power to propose legislation is related to the implementation of the Grand Justices' right of consent, Yu Youren will convene a discussion meeting of all Yuan members at 9:00 AM on the 11th to report on the progress of the meeting. It is learned that if the issue of the right to propose legislation must await the interpretation of the Grand Justices, then the meeting must be reconvened immediately to first exercise the right of consent, so that the Judicial Yuan can be formally established. Only after the Grand Justices' interpretation can it proceed through normal channels, otherwise it will not be possible to resolve the issue.

Although I have resigned more than ten times, requesting the selection of virtuous and capable individuals, this has not been permitted. Now, the Constitution is being implemented, and a new era is being ushered in. Our President appointed Mr. Zhang Boling as the first President of the Examination Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution. Mr. Zhang is a renowned educator in the country, and his morals, scholarship, and achievements are recognized throughout the country. Future construction will inevitably achieve great accomplishments. Chuanxian, with a pleasant mood, hands over all government and administrative affairs. I respectfully wish the examination and selection system to develop, and I wish all colleagues, under the instructions and leadership of President Zhang Boling, to assist in the work, so that our Founding Father's teachings of nurturing talent with proper guidance, encouraging talent with appropriate methods, and employing talent effectively can be fully realized, honoring the virtues of our ancestors and inspiring future generations, establishing a solid foundation for the examination and selection administration of the Republic of China, and opening a new era of peace for China. We must work together and assist the President in governing and consulting. I respectfully wish President Zhang health and all colleagues peace and well-being."

### Ideals and Reality

— Xie Youwei

——A Word for Mankind in Disappointment——

The Chinese are in disappointment, and the people of the whole world are also in disappointment. War has not solved the problems of the world, and victory has not solved our problems. The defeated people suffer, and the victorious people also suffer, at the very least, from the pain of feeling that ideals cannot be realized. During the war, people had ideals and hopes, and everyone fought for the ideals and hopes they yearned for. After the war, many ideals and hopes have not been realized; how can humanity not be disappointed?

Humanity's disappointment, of course, did not begin today. At the beginning of the twentieth century, humanity was full of hope. Mankind had a very strong belief in progress and in the future. They always thought that progress was not a problem. With the development of education and the promotion of science, with the intelligence that mankind already possessed, plus a certain amount of time, it would certainly be possible to turn the human world into a paradise in the near future. Before World War I, humanity certainly believed this. However, after World War I, humanity began to be disappointed. Humanity began to doubt progress and the future. The German philosopher Spengler's "The Decline of the West" was popular for a time. Liang Rengong's "Impressions of a Trip to Europe" also fully expressed the disappointment of the European people. However, at that time, humanity's disappointment seemed to be only partial, and only a minority, and seemed to be limited to the defeated countries and the countries most affected by the war. Some of the victorious countries and countries less affected by the war had many people dreaming of permanent peace. For example, the isolationists in the United States believed that by not joining the League of Nations and not interfering in European affairs, the United States could be forever at peace and enjoy its prosperous and happy life. These people were naturally not disappointed. But that is not the case now. After World War II, humanity's disappointment has become universal, affecting the majority of people, and the victorious countries are the same as the defeated countries. The richest and strongest of the victorious countries, the United States, is also in fear, also in disappointment, and no longer has illusions of peace. A sense of disappointment can be found universally in every part of the world. The disappointment of the Chinese is even greater, which goes without saying.

Humanity's disappointment is disappointment with culture itself. In the past, we all believed that culture could save humanity, that it could make humanity progress, and that it could make humanity happy. Now, humanity cannot help but be skeptical of culture, and cannot help but lose faith. Can culture save humanity? A disappointed soul would answer, isn't the atomic bomb the highest product of culture? If the atomic bomb is used universally, is there still a possibility of human existence? This is a very difficult question to answer. We once believed in education, but education has not solved the problems of humanity. What was the result of the country with the most universal and developed education, such as Germany? We once believed in science, but science has not solved the problems of humanity. The situation created by the atomic bomb is the most obvious example. We once believed in morality, and we once believed in religion, but morality and religion have still not solved the current problems of humanity. Every country speaks of morality and believes in religion, but when war breaks out, there is no such thing as morality, and no such thing as religion. Can the recent war in the Holy Land also be said to be the will of God? Therefore, the American philosopher Northrop, in his book "The Meeting of East and West," begins by saying: "Our world is a mysterious world. The achievements of this world are the glory of this world, and there is a threat to destroy this world. The nations of the world with the highest standard of living, the greatest ability to economically support their people, the most universal education, and the most enlightened morality and religion have demonstrated the weakest ability to avoid killing each other in war. It is as if the more civilized we are, the less ability we have to maintain civilization." In this situation, humanity cannot but be disappointed in culture; to be disappointed in culture is to be disappointed in oneself! Humanity has lost the way to save itself, and is almost trapped in the abyss of despair. How can one extricate oneself from this abyss?

The author has many words to say to disappointed humanity. Due to space limitations, I can only offer two points, as a word of advice for disappointed humanity:

First, we should know that there is always a distance between ideals and reality, and reality can never fully reach the realm of ideals. Although humanity is always seeking the realization of ideals, and ideals are always gradually being realized, the distance between ideals and reality always exists, and humanity always feels that reality is far inferior to ideals. This distance between ideals and reality, on the one hand, is the reason for humanity's disappointment, but on the other hand, it is precisely the reason for the existence of culture. The sole goal of the creation of culture is to shorten the distance between ideals and reality, and to help humanity realize its ideals. Without ideals, there is naturally no culture. If there are ideals, but ideals are no different from reality, that is, ideals are reality, and reality is ideals, everything we encounter seems to be nothing but ideal, then there is no need for culture. The reason why humanity needs culture is because reality is not as good as ideals, because there is still a distance between ideals and reality. Culture is all the efforts that humanity makes to shorten the distance between ideals and reality. These efforts are not in vain, they are not wasted. Although the current reality still has not reached the realm of ideals, this does not mean that we have not realized our ideals at all. We have realized many of our ideals. Even the ideals that we thought were the most extravagant in the past, such as the ideals of flying through the sky and escaping through the earth in the "Investiture of the Gods," can be said to have been realized in some way now. However, ideals that have been realized are no longer ideals, but reality. We are most likely to ignore and forget ideals that have been realized. We realize one kind of ideal, and immediately there is another kind of ideal, which makes us regard the ideals that have been realized as non-ideals. This is the main reason for humanity's disappointment, and it is also the main reason for cultural progress. Therefore, although the current world situation is far from ideal, and is indeed disappointing, humanity should never be pessimistic because of this. This is not the basis for our pessimism. The distance between ideals and reality is a necessary condition for the existence of culture, and it is also a necessary condition for making humanity's efforts meaningful. Suppose this distance really disappeared, what would be the use of education in an environment where everything is ideal? What is the use of science? What is the use of morality and religion? If disappointed humanity can pay attention to this point, I think their disappointed mood will be greatly reduced.

Second, we should know that we must not abandon ideals under any circumstances. The tragedy of humanity is naturally the tragedy of ideals that cannot be realized. But from the perspective of human history, people have not completely been loyal to the ideals they worship, and humanity has not tried its best to realize its ideals, and has not even truly believed in its ideals. For example, the most important ideal is permanent peace. But how many politicians of the past have truly believed in permanent peace? How many have been loyal to this ideal and truly worked for this ideal? Human politics has always been mostly so-called realistic politics. The so-called politicians are also mostly realists, not idealists. Politicians seem to be capable only of dealing with reality! They are mostly practitioners, not theorists. They often lack ideals, or even have no ideals. In words and in writing, they may mention ideals, but in reality and in action, they always unconsciously ignore ideals. The pain that humanity has encountered can be said to be mostly the pain caused by practical politicians. Politicians always abandon their ideals because of practical difficulties. Even politicians with rich ideals, such as former US President Roosevelt, could not help but abandon some of his ideals at the Yalta Conference. We have suffered from Chamberlain's appeasement policy, and we may still suffer from the realistic politics of other politicians! The current crisis of humanity is the crisis of politicians abandoning ideals! In the confrontation between the two major blocs of the United States and the Soviet Union, who is a politician who truly believes in permanent peace? If you don't believe it, I don't believe it, and everyone doesn't believe it, permanent peace will naturally not be possible. Therefore, the reason why ideals cannot be realized is not necessarily the fault of the ideals themselves, but the fault of humanity not believing in ideals, not being loyal to ideals, and not working for ideals! Humanity, which has already expressed disappointment in ideals, should especially know this.

It is inevitable and unavoidable that reality is not as good as ideals, and that ideals must be different from reality. Humanity will naturally be disappointed, but it should never be pessimistic because of disappointment, and it should not abandon ideals or stop talking about ideals. Culture progresses in disappointment without pessimism! Ideals are often realized in the midst of being impossible to realize! As long as humanity musters the courage and continues to work hard, the ideals that cannot be realized will surely be realized one day.

### Taiwan Provincial Assemblymen Argue with Deputy Director of the Finance Department Over NT Dollar Adjustment: Qiu Bincun Says Issuance Will Never Be Expanded

[Special Dispatch from Taipei, Our Newspaper, 10th] The Provincial Assembly held a full-day session today for the financial report and inquiries, presented by Qiu Bincun, Deputy Director of the Finance Department. He first pointed out that due to the overdue payment of public land rent and the surplus of public enterprises in the 36th year, the provincial finances had a deficit of more than 950 million yuan, and the budget for the first half of the 37th year was more than 10.7 billion yuan. After the report, Lü Yongkai, Lin Weigong, He Yi, Huang Liandeng, Yang Tao, and Su Weilang successively raised questions, repeatedly arguing for four hours about the NT dollar adjustment. Although the assemblymen stated that they did not oppose the principle of NT dollar adjustment, they expressed deep dissatisfaction with the impact on the province's export industry. They also criticized that the NT dollar adjustment still could not control the price of gold and US dollars, and expressed doubts about the amount of the joint currency issuance. In response, Qiu stated that the NT dollar adjustment was the only means to stabilize the lives of the people of Taiwan, although it may affect the export industry, the central government has exchange settlement methods to help. The reason for still losing control over gold and US dollars is that the adjustment rate is not enough. Although the joint currency issuance has increased monthly, it is absolutely in line with the needs of the province's economic construction and will never be expanded. Qiu also stated that the standard for the NT dollar is not the gold standard, nor the silver standard, but purely based on the province's production. If increased production is expected, the value of the NT dollar will increase rather than decrease.

### Tianjin Provincial Assemblymen Make Emergency Motion: Requesting the Abolition of the Tianjin Gold Control Bureau

### Hefei Repairs City Defense Works: Funding Issues Cause Storm; Deputy Speaker of Provincial Assembly Actually Paraded by Crowd

[Special Dispatch from Hefei, Our Newspaper, 10th] A local crowd paraded Tao Ruocun, Deputy Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, in Hefei today due to the construction of city defense works. As the military situation in Central China is becoming increasingly tense, the military authorities are adding to the construction of city defenses, with an estimated cost of 100 billion. Tao Ruocun suggested that the local area be responsible for 40 billion and that banks in the urban area split 30 billion. Local figures believe that since Hefei is already the provincial capital, this burden should be borne from the special donation for self-defense, but the Audit Committee established by the Provincial Assembly to manage the use of the special donation for self-defense did not approve it. In the morning, local figures held a meeting to request funds for purchasing materials, attended by 200 people, who publicly invited Tao to be the chairman. The crowd unanimously advocated that the Audit Committee approve the use of the special donation for self-defense, but Tao firmly refused, leading to public outrage. The crowd paraded Tao from the Provincial Assembly through the main street, posting slogans and shouting slogans such as "Down with the Audit Committee that is delaying the provincial capital's construction," causing pedestrians to gather and block the road. The police were dispatched to maintain order and escort Tao to the provincial government. In the afternoon, all sectors of Hefei invited reporters to a reception of the materials committee to request funding for the construction of the provincial capital's city defenses. Liu Ziheng, a county assemblyman, reported that since Liu Fei went south last year, the people of Hefei have been heavily burdened and are now unable to pay this huge sum. He also said that if they are forced to pay, there will only be strikes. At the same time, 20 members of the Provincial Assembly stationed in the city and assemblymen in Hefei held a meeting and unanimously agreed that the special donation for self-defense was stipulated to be used for the Security Regiment and the arsenal, and could not be used for other purposes. It was decided that: (1) The provincial government should investigate and punish the ringleaders of the incident, (2) Request security guarantees, (3) The Audit Committee should suspend its work temporarily, and (4) The date for convening a temporary congress should be determined separately.

### Rice-Robbing Incident Occurred in Suzhou Yesterday

Police Station Chief Reprimanded

[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, Our Newspaper, 10th] A rice-robbing incident occurred in Suzhou on the 10th. Although the negotiated price of white rice at Baimen on the 10th was only 22.4 million yuan, rice merchants calculated that there was no profit to be made at all, resulting in some rice shops either selling inferior white rice in the market, or even privately raising prices. It was reported that the price of high-quality white rice had risen as high as 29 million yuan, making it difficult for citizens to purchase, causing emotional impulses. At 8 am, the Jicheng Rice Shop in Nanhao Street outside Banmen, the Gantaihao on Shangtang Street, and the Zhengtaihao on Yadan Bridge all had disputes due to the sale of rice, and were subsequently robbed. Crowds of dozens of people gathered, but fortunately the authorities had ordered the police to be responsible for monitoring and prevention, so they were able to arrive early to suppress the situation and arrest the suspect Zhu Yunduan. The losses of each rice shop were minor, and stability was quickly restored. Afterwards, the responsible persons of the three rice shops and the arrested criminal were all handed over to the county government's military law office for trial. The responsible persons of the three rice shops firmly denied that they had raised prices. As a result, each was handed over to two shopkeepers to guarantee their appearance for investigation. Zhu Yunduan was detained without bail. Guo Yigang, the chief of the police station in charge of the western district, was reprimanded for negligence in prevention. From the 11th, the entire city will be closely guarded to prevent rioters from taking the opportunity to cause trouble.

First, a flag-granting ceremony was held, followed by the entry ceremony. After all the students took an oath, Commander and Chief Wang encouraged them with four points: to establish great ambitions, to be loving and sincere, and to not fear hardship or death. Speaker Pei Mingyu of the Provincial Assembly, in addition to presenting慰勞品 on behalf of all sectors, especially emphasized that the reason why Xiang Yu's 8,000 elite soldiers ultimately failed miserably was because they lacked an ideology and a central belief. Today, you 8,000 soldiers (Note: 3,000 more are being recruited) have the Three Principles of the People and are under the leadership of Commander Wang. In the future, you will surely save Shandong, eliminate the Communist bandits, and complete the mission of the era.

### Zhangye in Gansu Rich in Jiangnan Flavor, Barren Fields Line the Jiuquan Highway, Most of the Shandan Irrigation Canal is Completed

[Our Newspaper Jiuquan Ninth Dispatch] The Lanzhou reporter Yumen Oil Mine sightseeing group arrived in Zhangye on the fifth and reached Jiuquan at 5:00 PM on the ninth. Along the way, they entered and exited the Great Wall three times. Barren fields lined both sides of the highway. Most of Zuo Gong's willows have withered, and the newly planted ones are unlikely to grow. Within the boundaries of Wuwei and Shandan, irrigation canals crisscross, but without proper channels, farmland rarely benefits. The underground water interception project in Shandan is half a kilometer long, and one-third of the canal has been completed. The water conveyance canal, which is one kilometer long, is mostly completed. The water on the Gobi Desert flows down the canal, and it may be completed this year. In addition, the impression given by the Industrial Cooperative Society Peili School is good. Within Zhangye, water is distributed everywhere, and wheat ears are everywhere, especially with the flavor of Jiangnan.

This town is more than 400 li away from where the Mongolian people live, and the implementation of government orders is extremely difficult. This kind of administrative organization where people and land are separated from political power is still rare.

Jiuquan People Demand that the Hami People be Sent Back to Xinjiang

[Our Newspaper Jiuquan Tenth Dispatch] Regarding the matter of the more than one thousand Hami people in the Yuerhong area of Qilian Mountain being sent back to their original homes in Xinjiang, the people of Jiuquan and the local government unanimously demand that they be sent away within the deadline, starting from August 1st, according to the original plan. Because the Hami people in the area often plunder, the people cannot bear their disturbance, and they even plant opium. Although they repeatedly promised to return to Xinjiang last year, they all delayed their departure when the deadline arrived. Therefore, the people have asked the government to use force to expel them. In addition, more than a thousand Mongolian people in Mazong Mountain are also thinking of entering the Qilian Mountains for grazing. They are currently waiting for an opportunity to move. If the Hami people firmly refuse to move, then bloodshed and disputes between ethnic groups will be inevitable.

### Full Text of the Three Powers' Protest to the Soviet Union Released, Declaring the Right to Occupy Berlin, Resumption of Negotiations Requires Lifting the Blockade First

[Reuters London Ninth Dispatch] The governments of the United States, Britain, and France tonight released the contents of their respective notes of protest to the Soviet Union regarding the blockade of Berlin, pointing out that the Soviet Union's land blockade of Berlin has created an extremely serious international situation and suggesting that the four powers conduct negotiations to discuss the conditions for lifting these blockades. The three powers solemnly declare that even if there are differences of opinion, they should be resolved through negotiations or peaceful means stipulated in Article 33 of the United Nations Charter, in accordance with the spirit of United Nations partnership. Any occupying power attempting to impose a blockade on the residents of Berlin is intolerable. It is recalled that previously, a portion of the land first occupied by the Western Allied powers was handed over to the Soviet Union for occupation in exchange for the Western Allied powers' right to participate in the joint administration of Berlin. The Western Allied powers will not abandon these rights due to intimidation, pressure, or other actions. It is hoped that the Soviet government will have no doubts about this.

The notes of the three powers also reiterated that the Western three powers have long accepted the obligation to safeguard the welfare and security of the residents of West Berlin, and the three powers now have no choice but to firmly demand that the traffic between West Germany and Berlin, which was ordered to be blockaded by the Soviet authorities on June 18, be restored immediately. The needs of the civilians in Berlin are undeniable, so the full restoration of traffic to its original state is extremely urgent. Because the Soviet Union has promulgated traffic restrictions, the most basic human rights have also been damaged.

The American note is largely the same as the British and French notes, except that it pointed out that President Truman directly wrote to Stalin on June 14, 1945, suggesting that the United States withdraw its troops from deep within eastern Germany to the boundary originally agreed upon in 1945, provided that the right of the disaster relief army to enter Berlin via railways, highways, and aviation should be guaranteed by the Soviet side. Stalin replied to Truman on the 18th, guaranteeing that he would take all actions in accordance with the plan. The American note continued, stating that if the United States had any doubts about its right to freely enter Berlin, it would not have withdrawn its troops from the large portion of the region currently occupied by the Soviet Union.

### Stalin-Churchill-Roosevelt Secret Agreement Revealed - Powerful Basis for Joint Occupation of Berlin

The British note, after mentioning the exchange of letters between Truman and Stalin on June 14 and 16, 1945, further stated that Marshal Stalin and Churchill also exchanged similar letters. Based on this understanding, the British 21st Army, which had already reached the line of Wismar - Schwerin - Lüneburg - Domitz, withdrew to within the British occupation zone agreed upon by the four powers, while British troops were sent to Berlin to take on the task of occupation. The agreement on the occupation of Germany and Berlin was thus implemented. If the British government had any doubts about its right to freely enter the British zone of Berlin at that time, it would not have withdrawn from the portion of the region currently occupied by the Soviet army. Therefore, the British government's right to Berlin is based on the same foundation as the Soviet government. How can the former be denied while confirming the latter? In order to avoid any misunderstanding on this point, the British government must solemnly declare that the British occupation of Berlin and free access to Berlin are rights that arose after the overall defeat and unconditional surrender of Germany, and are confirmed by agreements concluded by the major allied powers. Britain will not abandon its rights due to intimidation, pressure, or other actions. It is hoped that the Soviet government will not have any doubts about this. The fact that Berlin is not part of the Soviet zone but an international occupation zone arises from this understanding.

### Based on Humanitarian Grounds - The Blockade Should be Lifted

The obligation that the commanders of each zone sincerely concluded, which was later confirmed by the Allied Control Council, and other customary measures, guarantee that the British government and other powers have the right to freely enter Berlin to fulfill their responsibilities as occupying countries. The facts and significance are extremely clear. Any other interpretation is sufficient to destroy reasonable rules and international principles. The British government, together with the American and French governments, is now jointly responsible for the welfare of the 2.4 million people in West Berlin at the request of the Soviet government in July 1945. The restrictions recently issued by the Soviet authorities have made it impossible for the British, American, and French governments to fulfill their responsibilities in an appropriate manner. The British responsibility for the welfare and security of the residents of the British zone of Berlin is a humanitarian responsibility. These residents include countless women and children whose health and safety depend on the continued import of essential supplies such as food and medicine into Berlin. These most basic human rights, which our government has solemnly promised to protect, are therefore in imminent danger due to traffic restrictions. Any occupying power attempting to impose a blockade on the residents of Berlin is intolerable. The British government therefore has no choice but to firmly demand the immediate restoration of passenger and freight transport between West Germany and Berlin in accordance with the agreement. The needs of the civilians in Berlin cannot be delayed for a day, so the restoration of traffic is extremely urgent. The British government maintains the above views, but is still willing to resolve differences in a manner that gives fair consideration to all parties concerned. The British government will not agree to handle the differences between the British and Soviet governments regarding the Berlin situation by means of coercion. These differences should be resolved through negotiations or peaceful means stipulated in Article 33 of the Charter. Therefore, the British government is prepared to participate in discussions by the four-power occupying authorities in Berlin to resolve any disputes arising from the administrative problems in Berlin as a first step in finding a solution. However, the restoration of the movement of passengers and goods between West Germany and the British, American, and French zones of Berlin should be a prerequisite for conducting four-power discussions.

### Democratic Party Convention to Officially Open Tomorrow; Eisenhower Firmly Refuses to Be a Presidential Candidate

[Special Dispatch from the U.S. Information Service, Philadelphia, 9th] Representatives from various states and territories of the United States arrived here in succession today to prepare for the Democratic National Convention, which will open on Monday to nominate candidates for president and vice president in the November national elections.

The Democratic Party's gathering will be held in the same auditorium where the Republican Party held its convention two weeks ago. The Democratic convention is expected to last four or five days. It is generally believed that President Truman may be nominated as the Democratic candidate. Several other individuals have also been suggested for nomination, most notably General Dwight D. Eisenhower and Chief Justice Douglas of the U.S. Supreme Court. However, both men have expressed their unwillingness to run. President Truman has the support of 286 delegates, and his supporters claim an additional 354, bringing the total to more than the 618 votes needed for nomination. President Truman has stated that if nominated, he has no preconceived notions regarding the selection of a vice president. Potential vice-presidential candidates include Senator Barkley, Representative Rayburn, New York Mayor O'Dwyer, Senator Lucas, Senator O'Mahoney, Representative McCormack, and Justice Douglas.

[Reuters, Philadelphia, 9th] General Dwight D. Eisenhower, currently the President of Columbia University, recently sent a letter to Democratic Senator Borah, stating that he will absolutely not accept the nomination as the Democratic presidential candidate to oppose Dewey. He requested that Borah not nominate him as a Democratic presidential candidate at the Democratic National Convention. Political figures believe that Eisenhower's firm statement is a fatal blow to the Democratic Party's chances of winning the election.

### Eastern European Bloc Communist Parties Reject Invitation; Do Not Attend Yugoslav Communist Party Congress; Intention to Isolate Yugoslavia

[United Press, London, 10th] Following the Soviet Union, communist parties in various European countries today rejected invitations to attend the Fifth Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party, scheduled to be held in Belgrade on the 21st. The stated reason is that the Yugoslav Communist Party is no longer a member of the communist family.

[Central News Agency, London, 9th] It is believed here that the Soviet Union's participation in the Four-Power proposal to Yugoslavia for convening a Danube River conference indicates that the Soviet authorities regard the Yugoslav government and its communist party as two separate entities, further demonstrating this trend. The Eastern European bloc communist parties' refusal to attend the Yugoslav Communist Party Congress clearly aims to isolate Yugoslavia and force Tito to step down.

### UN General Assembly to Convene in Paris in September; Secretary Marshall Decides to Attend Personally; Refuses to Comment on Whether Foreign Ministers' Conference Can Be Reopened

### Cominform Issues Statement Condemning Yugoslavia

— (Originally published in "The Christian Science Monitor," translated by the U.S. Information Service)

The Cominform recently issued a statement condemning Yugoslavia. The following is the main part of the full text, translated from the Czech newspaper *Rudé Právo*.

(1) The Cominform believes that the Yugoslav leadership has recently adopted a completely erroneous policy on major issues of foreign and domestic affairs, violating Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, the Cominform accepts the proposal of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to expose the erroneous policies of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party, especially Comrades Tito, Kardelj, and Djilas Ranković. (Note: Kardelj is the Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, Djilas is said to be the Minister of Propaganda of the Yugoslav Communist Party, and General Ranković is the Minister of Internal Affairs of Yugoslavia.)

(2) The Cominform has discovered that the Yugoslav leadership has created a policy of hatred towards the Soviet Union and other All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) countries. A disrespectful policy that underestimates Soviet military experts is tolerated in Yugoslavia. At the same time, Soviet military personnel are treated with contempt. Soviet private experts in Yugoslavia are subjected to a special system of constraints; they are watched by state and security agencies; they are under surveillance. The same surveillance and monitoring has been applied to Comrade Zhdánov, the representative of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) stationed at the Cominform, as well as to many Soviet officials stationed in Yugoslavia.

All these facts prove that the Yugoslav leadership stands on a position unworthy of communists. They regard the foreign policy of the Soviet Union and the foreign policy of imperialism as one and the same; they treat the Soviet Union in the same way as they treat bourgeois countries. Because the Yugoslav Central Committee has adopted this anti-Soviet policy, they have carried out all kinds of slanderous propaganda, bringing out Trotskyism, the headquarters of the counter-revolution, publicizing the "degeneration" of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) countries, and publicizing the "degeneration" of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

The Cominform condemns the anti-Soviet ideology of the Yugoslav leadership, believing that this ideology is only suitable for nationalists and is absolutely incompatible with Marxism-Leninism.

(3) In domestic affairs, the Yugoslav leaders have abandoned the position of the working class and deviated from Marx's theory of class and class struggle. They deny all the facts that capitalist factors have grown in Yugoslavia, thus intensifying the class struggle in the Yugoslav countryside.

The denial is based on an opportunistic view. This view holds that in the process of progressing from capitalism to socialism, the class struggle does not gradually intensify as Marxism-Leninism shows, but rather gradually disappears, just as the opportunist Bukharin thought. Bukharinists advocate the peaceful transition from capitalism to socialism. The Yugoslav leadership is pursuing an erroneous policy in the countryside, ignoring the class differences in rural society. An erroneous idea exists regarding class and class struggle; the well-known Leninist doctrine that small-scale private economies will eventually develop into capitalism and the bourgeoisie has been ignored.

Up to now, the political situation in the Yugoslav countryside gives us no reason to condone or ignore it. Today, the situation in Yugoslavia is that private agriculture dominates, land nationalization does not exist, the ownership of land as private property is legal, everyone can buy and sell land, a considerable amount of land is concentrated in the hands of some rich peasants (who oppose agricultural collectivization), and people can be hired to work. In these circumstances, it is impossible to educate and condone a party that attempts to obscure the class struggle. Because they believe that the peasants are the most solid foundation of the Yugoslav state, the Yugoslav Communist Party's leadership has departed from the Marxist-Leninist line and embarked on the path of nationalism and the kulaks on the issue of the tasks of the labor class.

Lenin once taught us that the proletariat is the only thoroughly revolutionary class in the current society, and therefore must be a leader in the struggle of all laborers (the struggle of the exploited against the oppressors and exploiters), leading all the people in a struggle for a thorough, democratic transformation.

The Yugoslav leaders are now violating this Marxist-Leninist doctrine.

### Clash Between Air Force and Tram Workers; British Company Suspends All Tram Lines for Half a Day; Military Police and Gendarmerie Hold Overnight Joint Trial; Both Sides Injured, Each Claiming the Other Is Responsible

[By Our Correspondent] All tram lines operated by the British company were suspended starting at noon yesterday in protest of the beating and injury of two tram conductors on Route 8 by Air Force personnel. Military police, gendarmerie, and municipal police authorities, as well as the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, dispatched personnel to the tram depot of the company on Wayside Road to mediate. After numerous twists and turns, Zhang Weihua, the director of the Air Force Supply Headquarters, fully accepted all the demands put forward by the workers, including punishing the perpetrators, compensating for medical expenses, and organizing a temporary military court to immediately investigate the soldiers involved. Only then did the workers agree to resume the operation of all tram lines, both rail and trackless, which was already 8:00 PM. According to company estimates, the loss in revenue during these eight hours reached hundreds of billions.

Route 8, running between the Bund and Yangtszepoo, at 11:32 AM yesterday, the crowded Tram No. 71 passed a stop at Seymour Road without stopping. Two Air Force personnel were waiting at the stop to board the tram, leading to a misunderstanding and a conflict. However, Tram No. 71 continued on its way. Within minutes, Tram No. 89, driven by driver Zhang Genbao, No. 802, arrived on its heels. By that time, many Air Force personnel had gathered at the stop, and more trams continued to arrive, leading to a brawl. Hearing the disturbance, the sentry at the gate of the West Warehouse of the Supply Headquarters of the Air Force Supply Command, located near the stop, rushed to the scene with rifles, dispersing the tram personnel. In the confusion, driver Zhang Genbao, No. 802, and conductor Chen Rukang, No. 2286, were dragged into the Air Force warehouse. According to the two men, they were stripped of their upper garments and their hands were tied behind their backs with ropes and subjected to wanton beatings. Zhang Genbao, No. 802, was kicked and punched and then lifted by several people and thrown to the ground, resulting in the most serious injuries. Fortunately, Section Staff Zhang Shukai of the Huangpu Police Precinct and Liu Songbo, an officer dispatched by the company to negotiate, arrived and secured the release of Zhang and Chen. The two were sent to the Municipal Fifth Hospital for treatment.

### Workers Park Trams in Protest; Workers' Emotions Run High; Tram Cars Covered in Slogans

Following this incident, news spread quickly throughout the depot. Outer service personnel on all lines parked their trams in protest. Trams lined up on Dongdaming Road, Yangtszepoo Road, Zhejiang Road, and other locations, covered in slogans such as "Protest Military Beating Workers" and "What Does the State Raise Soldiers For?" Passersby stopped to inquire, and at one point, there was a false rumor that one of the conductors had been beaten to death. Outer service workers at the Hart Road Depot also stopped work in response, collectively going to the Wayside Road Depot to offer their condolences, forming a complete work stoppage. Yan Zi, Captain of the Second Guard Battalion, Huang Yunlong, Chief of the Tilanqiao Police Precinct, Zhang Weihua, Director of the Supply Headquarters of the Air Force Supply Command, Fan Zhenbang, Section Chief of the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Gu Ruofeng, Deputy Section Chief, rushed to the Wayside Road Depot to vigorously persuade the workers to resume operation of all tram lines, but the workers' emotions were running high, and it had no effect.

Director Zhang of the Supply Headquarters of the Air Force Supply Command expressed to the drivers and conductors gathered in the square that he would thoroughly investigate the perpetrators and that even if the Air Force was not responsible, the soldiers who committed the violence would be punished. However, he hoped to resume tram service immediately to maintain traffic. Yan Zi, Captain of the Second Guard Battalion, Huang Yunlong, Chief of the Tilanqiao Precinct, Yan Feixian and Di Jiexian, specialists from the Social Affairs Bureau, also repeatedly urged the workers to resume traffic first and leave the matter to be resolved impartially. At this time, however, workers' representatives had been dispatched to the hospital to check on the injuries of the injured and had not yet returned to the depot to report. At the same time, there were differing opinions among the workers. Some demanded that the perpetrators be handed over first before resuming service, while others demanded that the perpetrators be handed over and immediately tried by a military court before resuming service. Zheng Yangda, the supervisor of the labor union, then asked the military police officers to temporarily retire to the office to rest so that the workers could concentrate their opinions and make a request.

### Workers Propose Four Conditions, Authorities Accept

The workers in the square then began to discuss and put forward four conditions: (1) A temporary military court should be formed, presided over by military police, gendarmerie, and Social Affairs Bureau officials, with workers sending representatives to attend as observers. (2) All losses of the injured shall be compensated by the perpetrators. (3) The Air Force officer on duty shall be punished. (4) The military police are requested to guarantee to prohibit illegal arrests of workers in the future. If there is any discrepancy, they should be sent to the police station or handed over to the company for handling. After these conditions were put forward, Director Zhang of the Air Force and Captain Yan of the Guard Department stated that they could accept all of them, but on the condition that the workers resume work immediately. However, at this time, the workers' representatives who had gone to the hospital to visit the injured had not yet returned, so a deadlock remained. Subsequently, Chief Huang of the Tilanqiao Police Station brought the injury report from the Municipal Fifth Hospital, reporting in public: "Driver Zhang Baogen, No. 802, has bruises on his chest and legs; Conductor Chen Rukang, No. 2286, has bruises on his chest, and there is subcutaneous bleeding on his right chest wall." None were seriously injured. At the same time, the workers' representatives also returned from the hospital, reporting that there was no danger to life. The workers' emotions then subsided slightly, but because the perpetrators had not been handed over, they still refused to resume work, but agreed to move the vehicles parked on the road into the depot first.

### Tram Service Resumes at Dusk

Finally, the Air Force sent Liu Jinyi, a mechanic who had clashed with driver Zhang Genbao, No. 802, and who also had a head injury, to the tram depot in a guard vehicle and handed him over to the guard personnel to be taken to the headquarters of the Second Guard Battalion for a joint trial by all the officers. Captain Yan also stated that he would handle the matter impartially. At this point, the workers felt satisfied and sent four representatives, driver Wang Zhijing, conductor Fu Weibang, Gao Naiding, and Bai Wengui, to the Guard Battalion to attend as observers, while the remaining workers dispersed to resume work. By the time the first tram resumed its service, the clock had struck eight.

### Details of the Joint Trial

The interrogation began at 9:30 PM in the Second Guard Battalion, presided over by Yan Zi, Captain of the Second Guard Battalion, Wang Ruli, Captain of the Dalian Road Gendarmerie, Wang Ximen, Deputy Chief of the Tilanqiao Police Precinct, Zhang Weihua, Director of the Supply Headquarters of the Air Force Supply Command, and Gu Ruofeng, Deputy Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau. First, the Air Force mechanic Liu Jinyi was interrogated. He claimed that he was going home for dinner after getting off work at 11:30 AM. When he left the warehouse, he saw a commotion in front of him, went to watch, and was hit hard on the head by driver No. 802 with an iron wrench without asking why, so he dragged the driver into the factory. He knew nothing else. The workers' representatives then stated the situation and the process of the dragging of driver No. 802 and conductor No. 2286 into the warehouse and their being tied up and beaten. However, because they had not witnessed it themselves, but only heard it from other drivers and conductors, they could not accurately say what happened. Zhang Shukai, a staff member of the Tilanqiao Police Station who went to the Air Force warehouse after the incident to bail out the detained driver and conductor, reported that he did indeed witness that the hands of driver No. 802 and conductor No. 2286 were tied behind their backs. The Air Force personnel asked him to write a receipt stating "Received the perpetrator and the weapon" before releasing them and sending them to the Fifth Hospital. (Note: The two injured were later transferred to Jimin Hospital by Wu Jinrong, the chief inspector of the tram company). At this point, the officers of the joint trial sternly questioned He Yimou, the duty officer of the warehouse, and Du Dingyu, the platoon leader of the guards, as to whether they had tied up the workers or witnessed anyone tying them up. The Director of the Supply Headquarters also urged them to tell the truth, considering the reputation of the Air Force. However, they all claimed that they did not know what was happening in the chaos at the time. After the officers of the joint trial exchanged opinions, they believed that mechanic Liu Jinyi himself was injured, and the truth of the dispute still needed to be investigated, and that whoever tied up the workers should be found and severely punished. Therefore, it would be best for the two injured workers to personally describe the process and identify the perpetrators. Captain Yan then sent personnel to Jimin Hospital to bring in the two injured drivers and conductors, but the hospital did not allow them to be taken away because the two were not fully recovered from their injuries. At this time, it was nearly midnight. Because the injured parties from the tram company had not arrived, the officers of the joint trial could not clarify the truth, and the four workers' representatives had no right to represent all the workers in reaching a settlement, so it was decided to suspend the interrogation temporarily and identify the perpetrators after the two injured arrive today in order to verify and handle the case.

### Smuggling of American Aid Materials Discovered on Ship Arriving in Shanghai; Crew Members Smuggle Goods; Value Exceeds 2 Billion Yuan; Three Suspects Transferred to Court for Trial

On the 7th of this month, the *Wanmei* Wheel, belonging to the Rehabilitation Affairs Committee, arrived in Shanghai from Iwo Jima, loaded with American aid materials, and docked at Wusong. Personnel dispatched by the Wusong Branch of the Jianghai Customs searched the ship and found more than 2,000 American vacuum tubes and several pieces of mechanical tools in the ship's bow ballast tank, with a total value of more than 2 billion yuan. It was obvious that they were hidden by the crew members with the intention of smuggling them into the country. They were immediately seized, and the captain of the ship turned over three crew members, Li Jinzhang, Gan Yinkang, and Fang Yongde, on the 8th of the same month. They confessed that they were smuggling in partnership and other circumstances.

### Gunshots and Blood at the New Light Theater; Manager Shot and Injured; Bullet Casings Found on the Road

[By Our Correspondent] Xia Lianliang, manager of the New Light Theater on Ningbo Road, a local, 41 years old, resident at 1410 Huashan Road, West Shanghai, yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, Xia, as usual, went to the theater office from his residence, accompanied by his nephew Wu Yifeng (20 years old, a student at the New China Law and Commerce College on Pingliang Road), in his own car No. 1410, driven by the driver Tao Chadi. When Xia got out of the car and stepped on the stone steps at the entrance of the New Light Theater, he suddenly heard two gunshots coming from the entrance of the theater. Xia rushed into the manager's office, still unaware that he had been shot twice. For a time, the stone steps were stained with blood, and the movie fans standing outside the door ran away in panic. When Xia sat down in the manager's office, he realized that he had been shot in the right wrist, and a bullet had pierced through his left abdomen and entered his right leg, neither bullet exiting. The gray suit he was wearing had two holes in it, stained with blood. Upon receiving the report, the Zhabei Police Precinct, led by Zhao Zhaosheng, the chief of the precinct, Wang Huachen, the deputy chief, Jiang Shangpei, the section chief, and Zhang Kuidong, a staff member, rushed to the scene to investigate. They found two bullet casings on the road in front of the candy store next door. Xia took himself to Hongren Hospital for treatment, and after diagnosis and surgery by the doctor, his condition was good. (Note: Xia was a student of Rui Qingrong, who died of illness in Chongqing during the War of Resistance.)

### Inheriting the Will to Commemorate Ancestors: The Cheng Brothers Enthusiastically Benefit Needy Students

Yesterday, this newspaper received a donation of 100 million yuan from readers Cheng Renhao, Renwu, Renzhen, and Bu Shi to help students through the newspaper's reader scholarship fund. In their accompanying letter, they said:

"Our late mother, Madam Tao, was enthusiastic about education. She often gave money to help the children of poor relatives and friends for decades. Last summer, our mother passed away from illness. Before her death, she still instructed Hao and others to economize on food and clothing and use the remaining funds to help students. This year, July 9th is the anniversary of our mother's death. In order to break superstitions, Hao and others have especially saved 100 million yuan from Buddhist ceremonies to help students, so as to continue our mother's unfinished business..."

Every day in this vast city, countless billions of dollars are often spent on superstitious practices. The Cheng brothers are able to break customs and commemorate their kind mother by helping students, turning uselessness into usefulness. This is truly something worthy of praise.

We hope this is a beginning. If everyone can follow the example of the Cheng brothers and donate generously, we believe that in the near future, the fundraising work for the newspaper's scholarship fund will be able to reach its expected goal. (Scholarship donation report will be published in tomorrow's Social Services section).

### Collective Forced Marriages in the Taihang Area: Buying an Old Man, Resulting in New Marital Woes

[Taiyuan Dispatch] In broad daylight, under the clear sky, it's truly unbelievable that this is happening in human society. This is a "collective forced marriage case" protected by "law," occurring in Guobao Village, Guan County, under the clutches of the Communist bandits in the Taihang area.

Jia Laobian is a farmer's daughter from Guobao Village, twenty-one years old this year. She is beautiful and charming, and has long been coveted by Communist cadres at all levels. However, because she married Wang Heinian from Koutou Village at the age of nineteen and lived a loving life after marriage, they had never been able to lay their hands on her.

Separation of the Lovebirds

After the "Land Reform Movement," according to "law," the poor were not allowed to marry the children of rich peasants. Wang Heinian was labeled a rich peasant, and according to "law," he was forced to divorce his beloved wife, Jia Laobian. On February 22 of this year, the divorce procedures were completed at the "village government." The lovebirds were suddenly separated, their hearts broken. For a moment, they couldn't help but cry loudly, moving the entire village to sorrow.

After the divorce, Jia Laobian returned to her parents' home in Guobaobao Village. The Communist henchmen of Guobao Village thought the time was ripe and began to "attack" her day and night, saying, "Our village's vice-director of the armed committee, Jia Laomi, and the demobilized soldier Guo Haisheng are both bachelors. You can choose to marry either one of them." Jia Laobian hated this in her heart, but she didn't dare to offend them too much, so she feigned a smile and said, "I just got divorced not long ago. Let's talk about it in a year. I won't marry anyone right now." The bandits, grinning cheekily, persisted in their entanglement, saying, "Maybe you don't want to marry Jia Laomi because you嫌 he has sores (syphilis). You should just marry Guo Haisheng!" Jia Laobian refused all of them. Later, the bandits held a meeting to discuss and decided to concentrate their firepower and take turns "attacking." After three days and three nights of "siege," she still refused, which angered the Communist instructor Jia Changfa. He slammed the table, glared fiercely, and said, "If you marry Lao Guo, everything will be fine. If you don't marry him, your mother won't have an easy time!" The head of the farmers' association coaxed her from the side, "If you marry a young man, he'll have to go to the army, and you'll be a widow anyway. If you marry Lao Guo, you won't have any problems, and he can even take care of your mother." With threats and inducements, they repeatedly forced her, but Jia Laobian, with her determination to "rather die than marry a Communist cadre," resolutely refused.

Three Zhang of Cloth

Unexpectedly, on the 28th, Mai Changfa, leading five or six ruffians with fierce expressions, came to Laobian's house shouting all the way. As soon as they entered, they said, "You can have whatever you want. Here's three zhang of cloth for you to sew some clothes to get married." Jia Laobian's heart sank, and she pleaded with tears, "I don't want anything. Please have mercy on me. I don't want to get married right now." The bandits were furious and shouted in unison, "Whether you want to or not, you have to!" With that, they threw down the three zhang of cloth, turned around and left, saying as they left, "Tomorrow you will be arrested as a 'big special agent' because you don't show respect for the cadres and refuse to listen!"

Threatening Letter

That same night, as Mai Laobian was weeping with her mother, she received a threatening letter, which read, "This afternoon, a letter came from the district saying that you don't want to marry Guo Haisheng, and tonight you will be arrested and taken to the district." It was signed by Political Director Jia Taixi. The person delivering the letter took out the district's official document from his pocket and slapped it hard, saying, "Look, the district's official document says that if you think it through, you don't have to go tonight, you can just get married tomorrow." The "Director of People's Education" snorted and said, "The marriage must happen!"

The next morning, the bandits gathered again in the "cooperative" to discuss a "full-scale attack" and instructed Guo Haisheng to prepare several hundred thousand yuan worth of wedding supplies. At the third watch of the night on the 29th, Jia Laobian was already fast asleep. Guo Haisheng opened the door according to the original plan and broke in, smiling and saying to Jia Laobian, "We're going to get married tomorrow. Everything is ready. I'll sleep with you tonight!" Laobian trembled all over, calling for her mother, and covered herself with the quilt. Guo Haisheng jumped onto the bed and raped her in front of her mother. The three of them twisted together, their cries, shouts, and calls for help intertwined. The neighbors were all frightened and at a loss, but after all, he didn't get his way. Before leaving, Guo Haisheng punched and kicked the mother and daughter.

Entering the Bridal Chamber

On the third day, bandits such as the political director, the director of people's education, and the chairman of the farmers' association arrived at Laobian's house in groups, claiming to "reason with her." They said, "If you didn't want to marry him, you shouldn't have accepted the cloth! Guo Haisheng also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars. You have to compensate him for everything. If you can't compensate him, we'll drive you out of the village." Another said, "If you don't pay, you won't get away with it today. Let's see how capable you are, still looking down on the cadres?" After saying that, the "political director" went to beat the gong to summon the women for a meeting to denounce Jia Laobian. At this time, Jia Laobian, filled with grief and indignation, pretended to go to the toilet and hanged herself. Her mother waited a long time and didn't see her return. When she went to the toilet to look, Jia Laobian was already dying. She was immediately rescued, fortunately not dying, but vomiting several mouthfuls of fresh blood. The bandits, upon hearing that Laobian had attempted suicide, not only did not show pity but were even more angry. As soon as she woke up, they dragged her to the "winter school" and ordered her to confess "why she didn't want to marry Guo Haisheng," and encouraged some female hooligans, saying, "Jia Laobian has sabotaged the village's land law outline and the textile movement. Everyone should beat her so she can't get out of bed for five days." All the women in the village, under the bandits' coercion and surveillance, used ropes, shoe soles... beating her senseless. They beat her four times in rotation, beating her to the point of death, her flesh and blood blurred. The pitiful Jia Laobian, unable to endure this torture, agreed to "willingly marry." That night, Guo Haisheng hosted a dumpling feast at the house of the "women's salvation director" Li Guohui for the "comrades" who had "helped" him and entered the "bridal chamber." The next day, the bandits celebrated wildly, congratulating each other, saying, "The great event has been accomplished!" (Times News Agency)

### The Course of the Great Victory in Eastern Henan: 100,000 Bandit Combat Troops Annihilated

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Li Tian

[This newspaper, Jinan, 9th by air] After Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi spoke with this newspaper's reporter about his impressions of the great victory in eastern Henan (see the front page yesterday), his deputy chief of staff, Zhang Yujin, further reported the detailed course of this battle as follows:

This time, the Communist bandits, with 250,000 troops from the main force of ten columns, when crossing the Yellow River from western Shandong, did not dare to act rashly because they were monitored and attacked by two powerful army corps of the National Army. At this time, Chen Yi's bandit troops (3rd, 8th, and 10th columns) in western Henan took advantage of the thin strength of the National Army in Kaifeng and occupied Bianyuan. At the same time, the bandits from western Shandong went south to support them. The National Army, in order to annihilate the main force of the bandits, immediately tracked and suppressed them. After recovering Wen, they continued south, pressing the bandits into the Yellow River flooded area. Because the National Army was pursuing them too closely, the bandits turned around and, starting on the night of June 28th, surrounded the Shen Chengnian division of the Youth Army Corps near Longwangdian, northwest of Sui County, and surrounded the Qiu Qingquan Army Corps west of Qi County. The bandits attacking the Shen division were from the (1st, 6th, and 3rd) columns, a total of three-six regiments, while the Shen division only had six regiments. The bandits originally planned to "eat" the Shen division in two or three days, and then join forces with the (3rd, 8th, and 10th) columns that were originally attacking the Qiu Qingquan Army Corps to "eat" the Qiu division and attempt to realize their dream of crossing the river. Unexpectedly, the Shen division fought to the bitter end. The bandits used human wave tactics and fire sea tactics to encircle and attack for five days and nights, but they did not succeed. In one case, a certain defending army only had one battalion. The bandits surrounded and attacked with three regiments for a day and night, and were completely wiped out. The next day, the bandits transferred another three regiments to attack, and the entire battalion heroically sacrificed. The indomitable Shen division, after holding out to the sixth day, after gaining the price of "one for three," was fortunately reinforced by the Huang Baitao and Sun Yuanliang Army Corps of the National Army, which rushed from the east and west. At the same time, the Qiu and Shen divisions attacked outward. The air force extensively bombed the areas occupied by the bandits in the unshielded Yellow River flooded area day and night. Especially because the weather was fine for nine days, without a drop of rain, by the evening of the 7th, the bandits finally could not hold out and fled in three directions: southwest, northeast, and southeast. The main force fled to Caoxian and the old Zhucheng area in southwestern Shandong. The National Army is closely pursuing and suppressing them with newly reinforced troops. This is just as Commander-in-Chief Liu said: not only did it shatter their dream of crossing the river, but it also made it impossible for them to flee north across the river, and it will annihilate them in one fell swoop. Deputy Chief of Staff Zhang concluded by saying: The greatest successes of this battle were (1) that the more than 100,000 bandits annihilated were mostly combat troops; (2) that not only was Chen Yi's main force defeated, but Liu Bocheng's main force also suffered heavy losses; (3) due to the victory on the main battlefield in eastern Henan, the siege on the branch battlefield in Yanzhou can be resolved soon, the bandits acting recklessly in northern Jiangsu towards Huaiyin can be eliminated, and the Xuji section of the Jinpu Railway can be reopened soon. Therefore, as of now, we can say that we have shattered 70% of the bandits' summer offensive. (4) This battle shows the strong fighting will of the National Army. On the contrary, the bandits scattered after being defeated, and their combat discipline collapsed. (5) At the beginning of this battle, the National Army headquarters did not shy away from its seriousness, so it was able to raise vigilance, closely deploy, and fight to the bitter end, and finally achieved the greatest victory since the suppression of the rebellion.

### July's Price Increase Becomes More Fierce: Rice Sold Close to 30 Million, Price Limits for Flour, Oil, and Grain Are Broken

[This newspaper dispatch] After the price of rice exceeded the 20 million mark, it paused for several days, but yesterday it suddenly rose again. In the northern market, white japonica rice was 25 million per shi, and in the southern market, white japonica rice was 23 million per shi, and both were medium-grade rice, with an average increase of about 1.5 million per shi compared to the previous day. The retail price is approaching the 30 million mark. It is said that the reason for this sudden increase is due to the sharp rise in prices in the producing areas. White japonica rice in Wuxi also reached 24 million per shi.

[Another dispatch] The regulated price of rice was automatically raised to 23 million yesterday, but due to the frequent increase in quotations in Wuxi, the producing area, and the increase in prices of various non-agricultural products, as well as various rumors, people's hearts were agitated, and only inferior indica rice was traded at the regulated price in the market. The off-market price for superior white japonica rice was 27 million, thin-hulled yang indica was also 27 million, up 3.5 million. Early rice was 25 million, japonica indica was 24 million, and Baiyuan was 26.5 million. A total of 407 shi arrived in the north and south markets.

### Price Limits Cannot Be Maintained

Flour

Starting yesterday, price limits were lifted and free trading resumed. Prices jumped wildly. The factory continued to supply as usual, and the street price increased to 8.28 million, an increase of 810,000, and the supply quantity remained the same. Trading in the market was brisk. Under the stimulus of rising prices of various goods and rumors, Lao Che flour soared past 9 million to 9.05 million. Bingship flour was 8.9 million, up 1.15 million to 1.3 million. Miscellaneous brands of flour were also available. There was only Shijin wheat bran and no sales.

Miscellaneous Grains

Although prices were regulated, with broad beans at 11.8 million, Che beans at 13.5 million, and other grains also regulated, the regulated prices were not cost-effective due to the sharp rise in prices of various non-agricultural products, so no one offered them. However, broad beans were supplied by various businesses to the street for actual sales, and about 400 packages were allocated at the regulated price of 11.8 million, five packages per household. There were few transactions in other miscellaneous grains. Yuan wheat rose by 3 million, horse beans rose by 1.5 million, sesame was not traded, and Hefei raw kernels rose to 46 million.

Edible Oil

Negotiated prices increased from 9 million to 10 million. Pure raw oil was 69 million, soybean oil was 54 million, and raw rapeseed oil was 52 million. However, this price was still not cost-effective based on yesterday's costs, so it could not be traded. Later, the oil factories jointly supplied the street market needs, distributing soybean oil and raw rapeseed oil, at a rate of five or ten dan per household, with the price according to the price limit. Due to the sharp rise in prices of various non-agricultural products, off-market prices for soybean oil were as high as 60 million, Gijiton熟 rapeseed oil was 58 million, and Gijiton small sesame oil was 70 million, an increase of 5 million to 6 million each. Dayouyu soybean cake was offered at 300 pieces per household, with a price of 5.6 million.

### The People's Hearts are Exceedingly Excited; Chinese Stocks Rise Sharply

Although Chinese stocks still had a fierce rise yesterday, caution increased twofold, and they slightly retreated near the close. The people's hearts were exceedingly excited. Wing On, Shanghai Industrial Investment Corp. (SIIC), and China Flour Mill were at their daily limit as soon as they opened. Other stocks opened high, and due to the demand for popular large stocks at a premium, they successively reached their daily limits one by one. After 10 o'clock, a full board of red was presented again. Gauze surged by 40%, boosting other goods. The general currency chips once again went to the stock market for a way out. Demand exceeded supply, and formal transactions disappeared. At the most popular time, Wing On added up to 550, SIIC needed another 10%, Xinguang added 3 yuan, and Jingfu added 1.5 yuan. As a result, around 11 o'clock, plainclothes personnel from the police department moved in to supervise the market, and the sharp momentum greatly decreased, thus arousing various rumors of caution. After 11:30, after settlements by brokers numbered 205, 219, 12, and 65, it retreated to the limit of increase for transactions. The remaining stocks dropped to varying degrees below the limit, ranging from several points to 10%. Wing On finally still needed a premium of 200 yuan. As a result, except for Wing On, SIIC, China France, China Flour, Xinyi, Tongyi, Rongfeng, Innerwear, Five Harmony, Yongye, Business United, and Zhabei reaching their limits, the remaining stocks rose by varying degrees from half a percent to one and a half percent. Among the various unlisted stocks outside the market, Culture, Public Utilities, and Textiles were the most popular, each rising strongly by more than 10%. The rest were also outstanding.

Yesterday, they trended upwards, with over 4 million in transactions.

At the same time, the association ordered the industry to trade according to the price limit and not exceed legal profits, so both buyers and sellers could not start. As a result, all goods were not opened for trading.

### Green Tea Stops Fatigue and Turns Firm

Zhentu and other green teas, mainly for export to Africa, have suddenly turned volatile since the general profit-taking cargo owners sold them off some time ago. However, the market unanimously stopped being fatigued and turned stable yesterday. Although prices did not rise, all revealed a firm state. Considering the reasons, the raw tea material production price has repeatedly increased, and the levy for processing and copying is increasing daily. Sellers are hoarding and holding, and the situation has turned around. Other varieties also began to stir at noon. As a result, there was a unanimous response, and many saw an upward trend. However, buyers felt that it was not easy to absorb smoothly for a while, and temporarily held a wait-and-see attitude.

### Although Transactions are Scarce, the Rising Wind is Astonishing; Gauze Creates Unprecedented High Prices

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were that cloth prices soared, the environment was conducive to buying, people's hearts were excited, and the market rose sharply. However, hot goods were rarely traded, and the supply of coarse and fine yarn on the market was very scarce. The reason was that the police were still strictly monitoring the market, the quotations could not be raised, cargo owners were unwilling to let go easily, and buyers were eager to search. The market atmosphere was secretly firm and lively.

21-count Double Horse yarn broke through the 1 billion mark as soon as it opened, rising to 1.15 billion yuan at the close, a sharp increase of 190 million yuan. Deliveries on Monday would be increased by another 100 million yuan. 20-count Golden Goose and Golden City were 1.2 billion for Monday delivery, and Three Sheep was 1.15 billion yuan. 16-count Zi Hu was 1.1 billion for Monday delivery. Other 42-count Blue Phoenix was quoted at 1.6 billion, 40-count was 1.5 billion, and 32-count Silver Moon was 1.4 billion. There were only quotations, and few transactions were seen. Later, around 11:30, the Standing Committee, fearing the expansion of the rising wind, ordered tightening. Finally, 21-count Double Horse was offered at 1.2 billion for Monday delivery. There were 22 single transactions throughout the day, with 96 pieces traded.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions were that floating capital was active, searching and purchasing surged, retail investors were pulling up, and the market atmosphere was more激昂 than ever. Military police control in the market was still strict, and the situation was at a standstill. A dark tide surged outside the market, and quotations were chaotic. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth and Four Gentlemen original serge once reached 40 million yuan, finally 39 million. Trumpet Boy fine cloth was traded at 36 million. Other 390 American T-shirts soared by 10 million, and Yintao bleached cloth also rose by 7 million. Blue cloth, original cloth, and twill poplin all showed strength.

Another report: The Textile Construction Company tendered 14.5 kinds of cotton cloth, including white embryos such as Trumpet Boy fine cloth and Four Gentlemen bleached cloth, Four Gentlemen original light twill, original fine cloth, original serge, etc. There were also Tianjin Red Five Blessings fine cloth. The self-filled prices were about 33 million to 6.5 million, limited to dyeing factories to purchase.

### Gauze Payment Methods Improved by National Banks

Regarding the methods of payment for gauze quotas allocated by the Yarn and Gauze Control Committee collected by the Central Bank, the Textile Construction Company once asked the Yarn and Gauze Control Committee to request the Central Bank to improve them. It is now learned that in order to facilitate the payment of money for all allotted customers, the Central Bank has, from today, stipulated that those who pay before 12:00 noon may use bank cashier's checks or checks for payment. Overtime payments must be paid in cash sealed by the bank, otherwise they will not be accepted. The Central Bank also requested that the Yarn and Gauze Control Committee strictly stipulate that those whose checks are returned once should immediately have their allocation qualification canceled. The Yarn and Gauze Control Committee has wired this new method to the Textile Construction for notification.

### Smuggling into Guangdong Customs Has Sharply Decreased in the Past Month

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 10th] (1) According to Guangdong Customs, since June, import smuggling has sharply decreased. In the past, there were nearly a thousand cases per month, but since June, it has been reduced by half. The reason is that in addition to the strict joint investigation by the Chinese and British governments, the main reason is that sales of various goods at home and abroad are weak, and fewer inland merchants come to handle goods. However, export smuggling is still rampant, especially rice exports. Customs has stepped up inspections.

### Severe Shortage of Banknotes in Chongqing Market

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 10th] Chongqing is facing a severe shortage of banknotes. Citizens must use cash to buy rice and flour.

(4) For items with quotas listed in the original plan, if both parties agree to mutually transfer them, and the total quota after the transfer does not exceed the sum of the original quotas of both parties, and does not affect the interests of third parties, the Commercial Commissioner may approve it and report it to the ministry for record. (5) When merchants withdraw goods in accordance with the approved plan, if the total selling price stipulated in each contract is less than 50,000 US dollars, the Commercial Commissioner may review it and submit it to the head of the delegation to Japan for approval before signing the contract. For those exceeding 50,000 US dollars, the inventory preparation situation must first be investigated before reviewing and approving it. As for the amount of contracts that have been signed but not yet fulfilled, it should be calculated together when reading the contract. If the new contract and the original unfulfilled part of the contract total more than 50,000 US dollars, the spot goods must first be inspected before handling. (6) For contracts exceeding 50,000 US dollars, the Commercial Commissioner should directly apply to the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office for responsible investigation and reply. If the inventory preparation for the exceeding part is 60% or more, the person should sign the contract according to the number. If it is less than 60%, report to the ministry for instructions first.

### Circular to All Provincial and Municipal Departments to Comply With; Banning Unregistered Private Schools; Mostly Violating Laws and Misleading Young People; No Enrollment Allowed Without Approval

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 10th] The Ministry of Education issued a circular to all provincial and municipal education departments on the 10th to strictly ban private schools that have not been approved and have started to enroll students. The main idea is that the establishment of private schools to cultivate young people and supplement national education should be encouraged and supported by the government. However, private schools should be established in accordance with regulations and relevant laws to meet standards. Recently, it has been found that many private schools in provinces and cities have insufficient funds, mediocre teachers, simple equipment, and enroll students without approval, charge tuition fees indiscriminately, and lower standards; not only do they violate laws, but they also mislead young people, which is heartbreaking! It is hereby announced that if there are those who have not complied with the regulations and have not been approved for establishment, and have enrolled students on their own, they should immediately set up a secret investigation and ban them immediately, and not be lenient in any way, so as to emphasize education. It is hoped that this will be strictly complied with.

### The Last Batch of World Games Delegation Departs from Shanghai Today; Led by Chief Leader Wang Zhengting

### Chief Leader Wang Zhengting Reports on the Registration, Preparation, and Participation Process

[Our Newspaper News] Dr. Gong Zhengting, the chief leader of the Chinese World Games delegation, gave a detailed report on the process of preparing for and participating in this World Games by the China National Sports Federation, the organization of the delegation, and the fundraising, etc., at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Kangle Restaurant before leaving the country, inviting reporters from various newspapers in the city. He also said that Chief Coach Ma John was unable to go abroad due to poor health, and Advisor Hao Gengsheng has been appointed concurrently. The summary of Wang's speech is recorded below:

### The Delegation's Formation Process

After receiving an invitation from the Organizing Committee of the 14th World Games in London, the China National Amateur Athletic Federation (體協) actively began preparations. The organization of the delegation, the selection of athlete representatives, and various regulations were all based on decisions made by the board of directors and supervisors, and were by no means subject to arbitrary changes. On January 7, 1947, the Standing Committee of the 體協 nominated Wang and John Ma, Rong Qizhao, Song Junfu, Jiang Lianggui, Xu Minhui, and Ji Shouyi, seven people in total, to form a selection committee. This selection committee then nominated various single-sport selection committees to select participating athletes. Subsequently, on November 2, 1947, a joint meeting of the 體協's board of directors and supervisors nominated Mr. Ren as the chief leader, Huang Shouyi as the secretary-general, John Ma as the head coach, Rong Qizhao as the football team leader, Jiang Lianggui as the basketball team leader, Li Huitang as the football team instructor, Song Junfu as the basketball team instructor, and Xu Minhui as the swimming team leader and instructor. On February 18, 1948, the Standing Committee approved the appointment of Ambassador Zheng Tianxi as an advisor. On May 3, 1948, the Standing Committee of the 體協, in addition to approving the organizational regulations of the Chinese delegation, also appointed Hao Gengsheng, Zhong Yuting, and Hu Hao as advisors, and Chen Yaosheng and Lai Tianchang (secretary of the Chinese Embassy in the UK) as liaisons, Tian Hanxiang as the Chinese secretary, Feng Chenzhen as the foreign language secretary, and Shi Zhaokang and Lu Xiangqian as staff members. In accordance with the organizational regulations of the delegation, the chief leader appointed Jia Lulu as manager and Wu Zhigang as assistant staff to assist with various matters of the delegation. As for Qian Xucang, Gu Qianlin, Wang Tongyuan, Zhuang Youren, and Gu Jiazhen, who went to the games at their own expense, this was based on the sixth resolution of the Standing Committee of the 體協 on May 3, 1948: "Socially enthusiastic people in sports who are enthusiastically donating to the federation's expenses and are willing to participate in the World Games at their own expense may be appointed as members of the delegation by the chief leader, following the precedents of the previous games."

### Fundraising

According to the regulations of the International Olympic Committee, it is composed of amateur athletes from countries around the world, with representatives generated by the national amateur athletic bodies. The 體協 was concerned about the funding for participation in the World Games, which posed quite a problem. The initial budget was US$120,000, but the national treasury was depleted and the government could not provide substantial financial assistance. Therefore, the 體協's board of directors and supervisors organized a fundraising committee, appointing Wang and Kong Xiangxi, Wu Tiecheng, Zhu Jiahua, Gu Zhenggang, Wu Guozhen, Hu Wenhu, and others as members, to solicit donations from various parties. On one hand, they requested the government to subsidize US$60,000, raise US$60,000 themselves, solicit US$30,000 from overseas Chinese, and raise US$30,000 domestically. As a result, they only received a subsidy of US$25,000 from the government, which was far from sufficient. This sum was only received on June 26. As for the donations solicited from various enthusiastic people in society, they were received gradually, totaling 8,492 million yuan in national currency. All expenses during the preparation period, as well as the expenses for selection and training, were paid from the raised funds. At the same time, due to severe food shortages in the UK after the war, most of the food for the representatives of various countries had to be self-provided. Therefore, on April 21, the delegation purchased grain and other necessities to be shipped by sea. All income and expenditure accounts will be sent to the government and donors separately after the World Games to ensure transparency. In addition, the donations raised domestically were all in legal tender and deposited in banks. Foreign exchange was applied for in mid-March, but was not approved. They were also unable to purchase foreign exchange in the black market. Fortunately, part of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) tickets were allowed to be paid in legal tender, which was a great help from the government to the World Games delegation. In addition, Hao Dongsheng raised US$25,000 in Nanyang. The football and basketball teams also went abroad in advance, reducing some of the burden. Such was the economic situation that allowed the World Games delegation to go ahead.

### Hoping for Assistance in Fulfilling the Mission

The World Games delegation, from the standpoint of the Chinese people's amateur athletic body, participated in this World Games. For those in society who are usually enthusiastic about sports and who have donated funds to the delegation, the move to appoint them as advisors was made. The selection of these advisors was all based on the resolution of the Standing Committee of the 體協 on May 3, 1948. All selected individuals were well-known figures in society, such as Zhong Yuting and Hu Hao, who are usually enthusiastic about sports. Under the conditions of financial difficulties and a lack of manpower, those responsible for the preparations for the Chinese World Games delegation have asked themselves if they have taken great pains and tried their best. They are grateful for the generous donations of funds from enthusiastic people in sports from all sides, as well as the allocation of funds from the state. China's amateur sports are still in their infancy and still rely on the concerted efforts of all parties in the country to promote them. They are deeply grateful for the detailed instructions from all sectors of society regarding this participation in the world competitions.

### Wang Zhenglin Not Selected – Our World Games Track and Field Representative

Wang Zhenglin, a long-distance runner, previously went to the United States with Lou Wenao for performances. Lou returned to China while Wang remained in the United States. At the time, it was rumored that Wang had been allowed by Wang Zhengting, chairman of the 體協, to go directly to England to participate in the World Games. However, according to Mr. Wang yesterday, Wang Zhenglin was not selected by the track and field selection committee, and therefore could not represent our country. Subsequently, Hao Gengsheng stated: "When Lou and Wang went to the United States, I had a personal discussion with Mr. Wang Zhengting about whether they could be given special consideration to represent our country if they were unable to return to China. Mr. Wang nodded in agreement. This was the actual situation at the time. However, Lou has already returned to China and participated in the national games, while Wang remained in the United States and was not selected through legal procedures. There have also been various rumors about his actions in the United States, so he cannot be a World Games athlete for us."

### World Games Delegation Air Tickets Handled by China Travel Service

The air tickets and seat reservations for the World Games delegation were entrusted to China Travel Service. According to Dr. Wang Zhengting, the chief leader, the company has a long-standing reputation for trustworthiness. The rumor that the delegation received rebates on ticket purchases is absolutely false.

### Chinese Baseball Team Victoriously Defeats U.S. Army – 7 to 5, Overcoming Defeat

[Our Newspaper] The Chinese baseball team yesterday, in the U.S. Navy League at the Racecourse, under extremely unfavorable circumstances, inspired by coach Liang Fuchu and leader Mei Qiju, fought valiantly and turned the tide with a 7-5 victory over the U.S. Army, maintaining a line of hope to compete with the Air Force again in the second cycle.

In yesterday's game, the Chinese team had to reluctantly make do because catcher He Jinben's hand injury had not healed. Bao Guanda barely filled the vacancy, resulting in a complete lack of coordination in the defense and numerous loopholes. The morale was extremely low and the team almost fell victim to the U.S. Army. Fortunately, the lineup was adjusted in the fourth inning, and Cao Kejia was used to face the challenge with a new formation. Leader Mei and Coach Liang shouted at the top of their voices to cheer on the Chinese athletes, gradually turning the tide. Taking advantage of the U.S. Army's disarray, they launched a full-fledged attack. After a fierce three-hour battle, they finally reversed the defeat and won the final victory. The scores of each inning are recorded below:

In addition, there will be two more games in the U.S. Navy Baseball League this afternoon. At 1:30 PM, the Air Force will play the Navy, and at 4:00 PM, China will play Patrol (represented by the Helena). The Chinese team tested a new formation yesterday and achieved satisfactory results. If there are no accidents today, they are expected to win again. The new lineup is recorded below:

Liang Yousheng, pitcher; Cao Kejia, catcher; Yu Changluan, first base; Liang Chengcong, second base; Bao Guanwen, third base; Liang Youwen, shortstop; Liang Youyi, left field; Zhong Baoluo, center field; Lu Zhaosen, right field. Reserves: Bao Lida, He Jingui, He Jinben, Li Qiteng, Mei Yingjun, Wang Nianzi.

### Chekhov's Notebook

— Shuanglu

For a lover of a great writer, even a fragment is precious enough. Therefore, the newly published "Chekhov's Notebook" will surely be cherished by readers who love Chekhov. Even a layman will find immense joy in reading it.

From 1892 to 1904, when Chekhov's reputation was at its peak, he left behind a notebook. He wrote down things that occurred to him by chance, even the outlines of his novels, but many of them were never written into novels later. For example, he wrote a story outline: "A woman with radical ideas, makes the sign of the cross every night, but is filled with prejudice and superstition at heart. She hears that as long as she boils a black cat to death at night, she will be happy. So she steals a cat and wants to boil it." For a Chekhov reader, one would inevitably want to ask: If Chekhov were to write this into a novel, how would he write it?

He also wrote another story outline: "A student in a village seminary is memorizing Latin. Every half hour, he runs to the maids' room downstairs, closes his eyes, touches them, and pinches them. The maids laugh and shout. After fooling around like this, he goes back upstairs to study. He calls this 'entertainment'."

These notes may not be comparable to what is found in the notebooks of modern great writers such as Gide and Henry James, but we can see how Chekhov developed his stories from ordinary things and ordinary observations.

He also wrote: "A young man earned a million marks, lay on these marks, and shot himself with a gun." The reader will immediately sense a genuine Chekhov atmosphere. In these notes, just as in his letters, he would sometimes change his serious, objective attitude and say a few witty words. No wonder Tolstoy called him a marvel. For example, he wrote: "Medicine is my wife, and literature is my mistress. When I get tired of one, I go to the other to spend the night. Although this is irregular, it is not boring, and neither of them loses anything because of my infidelity."

In his letters, Chekhov clearly stated his writing attitude: "My purpose is to kill two birds with one stone: on the one hand, to faithfully describe life, and on the other hand, to show how far this life is from the ideal life." He also said that a writer "should be as objective as a pharmacist… He must know that a pile of useless dirt plays a very important role in the landscape, and that evil passions and good passions are equally hidden in life." Chekhov achieved all of this in literature.

### Living in the Countryside

— Bao Zhongqi

Because our school is located in a village at the bottom of Yangshupu, living there all day is like being detached from the world. The international Cold War and the fluctuations in Shanghai's prices, if not for reading newspapers to learn a little, are simply as incomprehensible as "not knowing the Wei and Jin dynasties, let alone the Qin and Han dynasties," and have become a standard bumpkin. However, the true meaning of living in the countryside lies here. Tranquility and simplicity are the characteristics of the countryside. Walking in the fields in the morning and watching the villagers herding cattle and sheep is exhilarating; resting under the trees after class and after meals is leisurely and comfortable; the cool breeze carries us in the evening, looking up at the heavens and discussing with friends. This life is truly enviable!

I still remember when I was young and reading Selections of Ancient Prose, there were many articles describing scenery. The old teacher told us: "If an author can travel all over the world, deeply understand the meaning of what he sees and hears, and integrate it all, then his writing will surely have a magnificent spirit, a smooth style, a beautiful rhythm, and a solid structure, so that others will feel as if they are there when they read it." At the time, I didn't understand these words very much. However, after reading Weng Sen's "Four Seasons of Reading," and being able to read in this rural environment, I deeply realized that the words of the ancients and elders are true. As it says:

"Good birds on branches are also friends, fallen flowers on the water are all essays, what is the joy of reading like? Green fills the window, and the grass is not removed. After painting and chanting for a long time, cicadas chirp in the trees; late at night, the embers fall, and fireflies enter the curtain. The joy of reading is endless, and a melody on the Yaoqin brings a warm breeze. Yesterday, there was a sound of leaves in the courtyard; the bean flowers on the fence bloomed, and crickets chirped. The joy of reading is delightful; get up and play with the bright moon in the frosty sky. Sitting opposite the leather-bound books, the lamp moves on the wall; singing loudly in the middle of the night, the snow presses on the hut. Where can the joy of reading be found? A few plum blossoms mark the heart of the earth."

In just a few paragraphs, the different interests of reading in the four seasons are fully expressed. No wonder that in times of peace, scholars and literati loved to live in seclusion in the mountains and fields, quietly seeking this pleasure. Unfortunately, in these difficult times, this kind of life is no longer easily available.

Returning from summer vacation, I suddenly felt the urban noise and annoyance. I wrote this short article to remember it.

### Rambling on Neckties

— Yi Feng

People who wear suits have an inextricable connection with neckties. However, we rarely know the evolution of neckties.

It is said that the earliest ancestors to use neckties were the savages of the primitive era. They did not use neckties made of cloth or silk, but wore animal teeth and bones around their heads to show off their hunting skills.

The true founder of the necktie was the elegant Emperor Louis XIV, who happened to see a military officer wearing a white silk handkerchief around his neck. He thought it was admirable, so he copied it himself in a few days.

Later, the more he looked at it, the better he felt, so he simply gave it a name: "Cravat," and stipulated that it be a necessary decoration in the military uniform, and even formed a "Cravat" Imperial Guard.

One night, the "Cravat" army was fighting the British army, and the British army suddenly launched a night attack. The "Cravat" army was awakened from their dreams and hurriedly put on their uniforms. However, the "Cravat" neckwear was very time-consuming. What to do? In desperation, everyone came up with a quick idea: they used the rings in their hands to fasten the "Cravat" in front of their chests. So, when they returned to Paris, the "Cravat" had a new design.

After the American and French Revolutions, neckties officially gained status and became a necessary decoration for young men in general. They also began to use textiles of various bright colors as neckties.

However, the usage at that time was very clumsy. They only knew how to tie the knot, but didn't know how to remove it. Therefore, each necktie could only be used once, and at night, they would cut it off with scissors.

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, "low collars" began to be worn, so the style of neckties also changed. For a period of time, people loved to use knots. Today, the necktie has developed to its peak. When you walk into a department store or a large company, you can see colorful and dazzling new neckties hanging on the shelves. Many young people have really put in a lot of effort in the selection and application of neckties, in order to show off their skills in love affairs.

### Ode to Summer Slumber

— Shi Yu

The summer vacation is two or three months long, which cannot be considered short. University students all have a set of ideals and a string of plans. Who doesn't want to do a lot in this summer vacation? It is said that Harvard University students like to travel around the country during the summer vacation to broaden their horizons; Moscow University students like to find a job during the summer vacation to enrich their experience; Cambridge University students like to read extensively during the summer vacation to enrich their knowledge. I think what they love is not what our Chinese university students love. Who doesn't love to travel? Summer jobs are exactly what they are seeking day and night. Extensive reading is entirely their long-cherished wish.

Let's not talk about traveling around the country, but just going back to their hometown once is quite difficult. Many university students from Sichuan and Yunnan, looking at the millions of ship or plane ticket prices, either shake their heads and sigh, or their eyes spark with fire. Some people have spent a lot of effort and raised just enough travel expenses, but a sudden "adjustment" has turned their efforts into nothing. Some also think of strolling around other cities or going to the countryside, but the train prices have increased by 80%, and a meal outside costs 200,000 to 300,000, so how easy is it to stroll around! Furthermore, finding a summer job is even more difficult than climbing to the sky. This year, 60% of the graduates of national universities still lack a way out, who cares about you who haven't graduated? And even if you have the greatest good fortune, a short-term job is nothing more than a home tutor. There are quite a few university students who, with full enthusiasm, have placed advertisements for "available for hire" in the newspaper, but have not been "hired" after three months. Furthermore, to read extensively, original books now cost 4 or 5 US dollars, which is over 10 million per book. Don't say "extensive" reading, even "carefully" reading "one book" is already difficult. Therefore, this summer vacation, it seems that it is still best to hold a cattail fan, take a high nap during the day, and enjoy the cool in the evening. On the one hand, it is to nourish the spirit, so that the mind can be broad and the body can be fat. On the other hand, it also conforms to the purpose of "the summer days are long, just right for sleeping."

### Quitting Smoking is Difficult

— Qian Dacheng

Because the price of cigarettes is rising every day, even twice or three times a day, I quit smoking in anger. — It has been three days now. But at the same time, I haven't dared to go out for two days. Am I hiding from cigarette debts? No, I have always bought cigarettes with cash and have no habit of owing them. The reason I don't dare to go out is that I deeply believe in Lao Tzu's golden saying: "If you don't see what you desire, your heart will not be disturbed." Only I smoke in my family, so I don't feel too sad when I don't smoke at home. But as soon as I go out the door, the various green, red, white, and white signs in the cigarette shops are all my old and new friends. They are constantly greeting and signaling to me. It seems too inhumane to ignore them immediately, and I simply can't forget them. Even more so when I see people smoking heartily, perhaps some friends will say to me, "Why bother!" Maybe I will smoke again. I know my weaknesses very well, so I don't dare to take a step out the door.

After not smoking, I am not hungry or cold; but I still feel some indescribable discomfort. I have little interest in reading, and I can't write at all. Even the only bit of "leisurely interest" in a difficult life is swept away. All day long, I am dull and stiff, lonely and cool, and at a loss. It is said that a "Shanghai girl" can not eat, but she can't not smoke good cigarettes. The greatness of cigarettes can be seen from this. We, who妄想 to break away from cigarettes, feel too overestimating our abilities and simply asking for trouble. If I don't smoke, I can't write articles, and of course there will be no稿費, and I feel that it is not worth the loss.供奉烟霞 is perhaps a奇福 in the world. So I want to smoke again. I am preparing to buy a kind of native烟, called "Zhuguan", which is very refined. It is said that the price is much cheaper than cigarettes. I will also take out my grandmother's water烟筒 and tidy it up. Holding it in my hand, it has an ancient charm. If I smoke机筒, my thoughts will naturally flow like a torrent, and I will also gain the good name of loving domestic products, killing two birds with one stone, isn't that great? At the same time, I also experienced the flavor of my grandmother's era, the "leisurely interest" of which is more than smoking cigarettes.

### Small Statistics

— Hans

The largest commodity that Australia exports to the United States is wool, followed by rabbit skins. According to statistics, the value of rabbit skins that Australia exported to the United States last year reached a whopping 10 million US dollars.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are currently 632,667 salesmen (who travel around selling goods) in the United States, of whom women account for about 2%.

The fastest "escalator" (like the one in Shanghai's Daxin Company) in the world is in New York's Rockefeller Center, which can rise 125 feet per minute.

### Huangpi (Clausena lansium)

— Gongsun Wu

There is an old saying in eastern Guangdong: "Eat lychees when hungry, and huangpi when full." Among the southern fruits that are rich in juice, lychee is the best. Other fruits cannot be eaten much, but this fruit is an exception. Eating 300 a day is not too much, and eating them every day is not harmful. It can relieve hunger, which is a great virtue, so it should be ranked among staple foods, not just appreciated for its beautiful fragrance. After the lychees are gone, huangpi takes their place. It is sweet and sour, and the skin has a strong fragrance. It can regulate Qi and aid digestion. It can be preserved for a long time by pickling it in salt water and licorice juice and drying it in the sun. Those who are surfeited with wine and meat can chew a few, and they will immediately feel refreshed. Or it can be cooked with syrup, and the taste is even more precious. Westerners love it no less than candy. Occasionally, I checked ordinary English and American dictionaries and didn't find the word "lychee," but I found "huangpi," which is slightly inaccurate. A half-foreign dictionary notes its etymology, which is exactly taken from the pronunciation of our country. This thing is also produced in East India, and the British use a word made by our country to make this word, but I don't know why. English dictionaries also have "扁桃" [almond], which is also a word made by taking the pronunciation of Guangdong and Guangxi. 扁桃 is like mango but smaller, and the taste is sour and unpalatable, but it is good to stir-fry with meat. "Mango" is an Indian word.

### Rhyming with Qian Mocun

— Qiao Dazhuang

A traveler's clothes lit by a silver lamp in an inn, a long journey – are you a hero or not? The world speaks of a noble scholar's prose from Suzhou, the wind sends a light carriage returning from the sea. Standing alone, among a thousand, is slightly different, Heaven permits a low flight. Wanting to seek the calligraphic texts in the stone chamber, a white-haired rendezvous may not succeed.

This poem was mailed from Nanjing on June 27th, only six days before Mr. Qiao's suicide, and is probably his last poem. After the poem are the eight characters "First try with famous ink, the paper is a bit poor." -- Editor

### The Bridesmaid's Dress

— Ruyi

The bridesmaid's dress is often very similar to the bride's dress. It is said that the origin of this custom is as follows:

Hundreds of years ago, many people had a superstition that when a person reaches the peak of happiness, he or she is often envied by demons or monsters, which leads to extreme joy turning into sorrow, and unfortunate events occurring. Making the bridesmaid's dress similar to the bride's dress during the wedding ceremony can deceive the eyes of demons or monsters, and unfortunate events can be avoided.

### 

I recently saw in the "Pingjin Daily" a report from Nanjing that "Cao Yuanbi, an old Hanlin scholar from Suzhou, at the age of eighty-two, married an unmarried woman of fifty-six years old through a friend's introduction. The wedding ceremony took place on July 4th, with red candles illuminating the scene, becoming a celebrated story. This is believed to be an unprecedented tale, even more remarkable than the union of Xiong Xiling and Miss Mao twenty-four years ago. At that time, Xiong Xiling was sixty-six years old, and Miss Mao was thirty-three, half the age of her husband. Now, Old Man Cao is at an advanced age, surpassing the 'approaching seventy' age of Old Man Xiong back then, and this old bride is also more than twenty years older than Mrs. Xiong Mao at the time of her marriage. It can be seen that times are changing day by day, and legendary and strange news is emerging endlessly."

When Xiong and Mao married, it was widely said that the "old Hanlin scholar" was vigorous in his old age. Now, Mr. Cao is also called "old Hanlin scholar." Other elderly people with past imperial examination degrees, such as Chen Xiaoshi, who lives in Shanghai, and the late Huang Shoujing, who lived in Pingjin, are also often referred to as "old Hanlin scholars." It seems that people generally misunderstand "Hanlin" as a common term for reputable veterans of the imperial examination, but they do not know that "Hanlin" has a specific definition, just like the academic qualifications of students studying abroad, which also have varying degrees of depth. One cannot simply call everyone who returns from Europe and America a Doctor of Philosophy. Furthermore, one must know that the "Hanlin Academy" is a government office with various officials who are responsible for literary service and writing, while the "Censorate" is responsible for investigating and impeaching officials, just like the current five Yuans, each with its own responsibilities. A Jinshi (successful candidate in the highest imperial examination) who does not enter the Hanlin Academy is not a Hanlin, just as a Doctor of Law who is not elected to the Legislative Yuan cannot be considered a legislator. Once such a comparison is considered, a clear understanding of what constitutes a "Hanlin" can be obtained.

This "eighty-two" year old groom, Cao Yuanbi, was a Jinshi of the Yiwei year (Qing Guangxu 21st year, the same year as Kang Youwei), a secretary of the Grand Secretariat, known for his erudition and skill in writing, textual research, epigraphy, and bibliography, and was respected by famous officials and dignitaries of the time. However, he did not enter the Hanlin Academy, so he is not a Hanlin. Furthermore, Chen Xiaoshi was a Jinshi of the Bingxu year of Guangxu 12th year and a Juren of the Yihai year (Guangxu 1st year). In the 24th year of the Republic of China (Yihai), he celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of his provincial examination success, and the year before last (the 35th year of the Republic of China, Bingxu), he also celebrated the reunion of the palace examination results. Not only are his imperial examination achievements a topic of conversation, but he is also a person of great longevity. However, he was appointed as a principal from the Jinshi degree, and his government office was the Ministry of War, not the Hanlin. Furthermore, Tang Weizhi (Wenzhi), who once served as a Vice Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce and Acting Minister, was a Jinshi of the Renxu year, and had an excellent political and literary status, but after becoming a Jinshi, he was a Principal of the Ministry of Revenue, also not a Hanlin. Cai Yuanpei was also a Jinshi of the Renxu year (passed the provincial examination in the Gengyin year and took the palace examination in the Renxu year), and was a classmate of Tang. Cai was changed from Jinshi to Shujishi and entered the Hanlin Academy, and in the Jiawu year was appointed as an editor, which makes him an undoubtedly old Hanlin.
