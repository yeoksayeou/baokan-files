[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 18th] President Chiang Kai-shek visited Shenyang again at noon on the 18th. This is his third visit in recent days, demonstrating his deep concern for the Northeast. The President did not enter the city proper this time but summoned Wei Lihuang, Du Yuming, Zhao Jiajun, and others at the airport for a meeting, after which he flew back to Beiping.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] President Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi, inspected the western suburbs of Beiping City at 3:00 PM on the 18th and returned to his residence at 7:00 PM.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 18th] President Chiang Kai-shek celebrated his 62nd birthday yesterday, but due to the extraordinary circumstances, he instructed his family and staff to keep it secret. It is reported that many military and political leaders from Beiping visited his residence to pay their respects, but none publicly offered birthday wishes. Only at dinner did a certain leader slightly express birthday congratulations, which the President subtly brushed aside with other words. After the dinner, there was a simple program to mark the occasion, with a cream cake about 30 centimeters in size placed on the table, adorned with 62 small birthday candles.

### Weng Wenhao Attends Legislative Yuan Meeting, Frankly Explains the Financial and Economic Situation, Controls Floating Capital and Regulates the Market to Solve the Price Problem, Will Open Self-Funded Foreign Exchange for Import of Materials

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Legislative Yuan held a closed-door meeting to review prices, starting at 9:30 AM on the 18th. Over 400 members attended. President Sun Ke was absent due to other business and was replaced by Vice President Chen Lifu as chairman. Premier Weng Wenhao, Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu, Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Food Guan Jiyu, Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian, and Deputy Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan attended. Premier Weng gave a review of the financial and economic situation since the issuance of the Gold Yuan. He explained that from August 19th to the end of September, the amount of gold, silver, and foreign currency collected, export revenue, remittances from overseas Chinese, and foreign currency deposits received by the Central Bank exceeded tens of millions of yuan and are still increasing. Regarding the illegal trading by Communist bandits and unscrupulous speculators in various places in North and South China, which has created a black market for gold banknotes, the government is closely monitoring the situation and will take strong measures to combat it. Interest rates and exchange rates in the financial market have been effectively suppressed. This success has increased the deposits received by state-owned banks by three times and the deposits received by commercial banks by seven times, totaling over 180 million Gold Yuan more than before August 19th. Regarding the price problem, Weng frankly admitted that the government did not take into account the fact that the black market rates in the Southwest were far lower than in Nanjing and Shanghai when formulating the exchange rate between the Gold Yuan and the US dollar. The sudden increase in the exchange rate affected prices, and the nickel coin craze in Chengdu and Kunming also destabilized the people and caused prices to soar. Furthermore, since August 19th, the collection of gold, silver, and foreign currency accounted for two-thirds of the amount of Gold Yuan issued. This large amount of floating capital has flooded the market, creating a buying spree and causing prices to rise sharply. Weng also stated that the failure to thoroughly freeze prices was a major mistake. As for the situation of productive enterprises, the reality today is unfortunately the opposite of the original estimates, and the reasons for this are even more complex. When prices were frozen on August 19th, raw material prices had already risen, but the prices of finished products had not been adjusted. After manufacturers produced finished products, the selling price was less than the cost, and production was suspended. In addition, frozen freight rates and rising fuel costs hindered the transportation of goods. State-owned banks and private banks did not provide many loans, resulting in insufficient working capital for productive enterprises. The influence of the military situation also caused productive enterprises to shrink. During his report, Weng spoke sincerely. After frankly explaining the current financial and economic situation, he proposed that the government would solve the current price problem by controlling floating capital and regulating the market. The measures taken by the government to control floating capital have gradually shown results. For example, the issuance of short-term treasury bills has reached 100 million Gold Yuan, the sale of shares in state-owned enterprises has reached 6 million Gold Yuan, and the encouragement of commercial banks to increase capital can reach 100 million Gold Yuan. In the future, it is planned to accelerate the sale of enemy and puppet property and gradually prepare to issue company bonds for legitimate productive enterprises, and open up the use of foreign exchange deposits. The shares of state-owned enterprises will be guaranteed interest, and credit will be enhanced by reorganizing the board of directors and inviting new shareholders to visit. In addition, the flow of funds and the transportation of raw materials and finished products for productive enterprises will be facilitated as much as possible. Regarding the regulation of the cloth market, the government is determined to do everything possible to crack down on hoarding, channel the sources of materials, and promote commercial stability by setting reasonable price limits based on fair principles.

### The Center of Fighting in the Suburbs of Taiyuan Shifts to the Mountainous Area, Cannon Fire All Night Along the Line from the Southeast to the Northeast of the City

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 18th] The fighting on the outskirts of Taiyuan is quite fierce, with the bandits constantly sending reinforcements and launching several fierce attacks. The fighting was particularly intense last night in Pingtou, Shizui, and Qianhou Licun in the suburbs of Taiyuan. A bandit column and artillery regiment that fled west from Shizhuang have now crossed Yuchi and headed north.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 18th] The focus of the fighting in the suburbs of Taiyuan has recently shifted to the mountainous area from the southeast to the northeast of the city. The strongholds of Heituo Zaoyuan, Madigou, Gaoyadi, and Jiehua, about 20 li southeast of the city, and Guadigou, 15 li northeast of the city, and Yulinping, over 20 li from the city, were the scenes of fierce fighting all night on the 17th, with loud cannon fire clearly audible in the city. The 44th and 38th Brigades of bandits attacking Heituo Zaoyuan suffered heavy casualties after being severely beaten by the National Army. By 10:00 AM, the offensive had stalled. The 4th and Ye 3 Brigades of bandits attacking Yulinping repeatedly charged the National Army positions under the cover of artillery fire but were all repelled. The National Army is still engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits in Guadigou and Madigou. Furthermore, in the afternoon, the National Army, in close cooperation with the infantry and artillery, launched a sweep against the bandits near Nanpingtou, about 20 li south of the city. The bandits stubbornly resisted, but were fiercely attacked by the strong firepower of the regiment, and the air force also provided air support. Most of the bandits' fortifications were destroyed, and over 600 were killed or wounded.

### Song Ziwen Returns to Guangzhou From Hong Kong

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 18th] Chairman Song Ziwen returned to Guangzhou by special plane from Hong Kong at 2:00 PM on the 18th. He was accompanied by Ding Shiqi, Manager of the Central Bank, Huang Guang, Manager of the Bank of Communications, and others.

### Wang Yunwu's Report

After Premier Weng's report, Minister of Finance Wang made supplementary explanations. Based on statistical data, he analyzed the price changes before and after 1949, and cited the price examples of rice, coal, and cotton cloth to point out that price increases and decreases varied from place to place after the currency reform. The recent fluctuations were actually due to the disturbances by the Communist bandits, the changes in the military situation, the obstruction of material transportation, and the instability of social psychology. He stated that the government is actively carrying out measures to stabilize prices, which are divided into five items: (1) Increasing production: 20 million US dollars of industrial raw materials will be imported, and efforts will be made to eliminate manufacturers' concerns and actively increase production. (2) Saving consumption: resolute measures will be taken to thoroughly implement savings. (3) Clearing materials: self-funded foreign exchange will be opened for the import of materials, and local governments and troops will be strictly ordered not to hinder the flow of materials. (4) Controlling floating capital. (5) Reasonable price limits: hoarding will be absolutely prohibited. From 11:00 AM, members began to question. Six people spoke and submitted written questions in the morning, mostly hoping that the government would implement laws and regulations to gain the trust of the people, and strictly and earnestly crack down on various black markets to prevent the Communist bandits from taking the opportunity to cause trouble. The meeting adjourned at noon. The meeting continued at around 3:00 PM in the afternoon. More than ten people continued to speak and submit written questions, all advocating that the government should stabilize the currency system, crack down on the gold banknote black market, step up mass production, and implement comprehensive distribution. At 5:40 PM, more than 20 people had not had time to speak or read their written opinions, but due to the urgency of time, with the approval of the chairman and the members, the speech was stopped, and Premier Weng and Minister Wang were asked to answer. Mr. Weng gave a brief reply to several questions and reiterated the government's determination to maintain the Gold Yuan, asking the members to inform all sectors of society not to lightly believe rumors and shake confidence, and hoping that the members would supervise the responsible executors of various departments at any time. The government is willing to humbly accept the valuable opinions of the members. Minister of Finance Wang first stated: "The reserve of gold bonds is increasing day by day, and its issuance is made public on a monthly basis. The current amount of issuance is far from the maximum amount of issuance and cannot be said to have reached the point of expansion." Mr. Wang explained the reason why tax revenues were low in July, August, and September, saying that the taxes collected in July and August were calculated in legal tender and levied at the old tax rate, so the amount in July, August, and September was very small, but the number of collections in the next three months will inevitably increase, and revenue and expenditure will gradually tend to balance. The registration of foreign assets abroad is being promoted in various places, and powerful overseas Chinese businessmen are determined to take the lead, so the future is optimistic. Regarding the capital increase of banks, it will never be extended. Regarding the issue of price adjustment, Mr. Wang said: "When is the most appropriate time for price adjustment, the government still needs to consider carefully, and the time for decision has not yet arrived." The meeting was adjourned at 6:15 PM.

### ECA and the US Aid Utilization Committee Announce Continued Allocation of Construction Parts Fund, A Total of 37.75 Million US Dollars Allocated, Shanghai Electric Power Company Receives Construction Loan of 5 Million US Dollars

[ECA, This City] The fund for the ECA's Construction and Parts Replenishment Program for China, with an approved fund of 70 million US dollars, was jointly announced by the ECA and the US Aid Utilization Committee on the 18th that it would allocate another 37.75 million US dollars from this fund.

The newly approved amount for parts is 12.75 million US dollars, which, together with the previously announced 22.25 million US dollars, brings the total approved amount for the parts program to 35 million US dollars. This fund is a form of grant to assist the Chinese government.

Regarding the construction plan portion, the approved amount is stipulated to be 35 million US dollars, and the total amount announced today is 25 million US dollars, which is the first announced allocation under the construction plan. This aid will be in the form of loans to China. Among the ECA's 275 million US dollar economic aid plan to China, the above-mentioned aid is the only one intended to be in the form of loans.

This announcement was made by Yan Jiagan, a member of the US Aid Utilization Committee, and Stuart Lipton, head of the ECA China Technical Investigation Team.

The allocation of new parts plan funds is as follows: New approved amount of 6 million US dollars for the transportation and traffic parts replenishment plan. Parts plan for coal mines across the country, 1 million US dollars. Parts plan for tin, antimony, and tungsten mines in Central China, South China, and Southwest China, 500,000 US dollars. Other parts plans, 5.25 million US dollars (public utilities power plants that failed to obtain the foreign exchange needed for the required parts plan from the Export Council in the past can obtain some assistance under this item).

The factories and mines that have received recovery loans are as follows:

Coal mines: Huainan Coal Mine in the Yangtze River Basin, 3.5 million US dollars, Nanshu Coal Mine in South China, 750,000 US dollars, coal mines in Central China, South China, and Taiwan, 750,000 US dollars, Gaokuang Coal Mine in Central China and South China, 400 US dollars.

Electricity, Shanghai Electric Power Company 5 million US dollars, Taiwan Electric Power Company 3.5 million US dollars (including 1.5 million US dollars for the proposed Taiwan General Fertilizer Company).

Fertilizer plants: Taiwan Yimin Fertilizer Company (jointly operated by the Resources Committee, the Bank of China, and Shenchang Yihang) 4 million US dollars, Hekowan Keelung Hsinchu—Fertilizer Plant of the Resources Committee, 1 million US dollars, Nanjing Yongli Chemical Company 500,000 US dollars.

Tin and antimony mines: Southwestern Central China and South China 2 million US dollars.

It is generally expected that various coal mines that are eligible for assistance will now submit their plan proposals to the Joint Committee on Parts Recovery of the US Aid Utilization Committee and the Economic Cooperation Administration.

The above-mentioned beneficiaries can now select design engineers to submit suggestions to the Joint Committee.

These engineering firms will be responsible for implementing these plans at the lowest cost and in the shortest time.

The engineering firm must submit a pledge representing its plan, which is countersigned by the technician executing the plan. This pledge will prove that based on appropriate technical surveys, the plan can be expected to produce the highest degree of efficiency at the lowest possible cost.

The pledge will be submitted to a review agency, namely the special engineering firm hired by the Chinese government, which serves as the consultant and supervising engineer for the Joint Committee.

[US News Agency, This City] The bulletin issued by the US Aid Utilization Committee and the Economic Cooperation Longitudinal Office on the 18th regarding industrial parts and recovery plans raised the different issues of donations and loans.

All parts plans are funded under the grant item. In fact, what is called a grant is a kind of US dollar loan that the Chinese government does not need to repay.

The recovery plan is funded under the loan item. A loan is also a kind of foreign exchange loan to the Chinese government, but the Chinese government is responsible for repayment to the United States.

Of the 275 million US dollars allocated under the name of economic aid to China, only 35 million US dollars are included under the loan item.

Regardless of whether the aid is granted or loaned, the foreign exchange provided by the United States to China will enable China to import materials and equipment that are necessary for domestic recovery and cannot be obtained without US aid.

### Hope for Increased US Aid, Aid to China to Double

Truman, Hoffman, Lapham Meeting

[United Press International, Washington, 17th] President Truman held an unusual Sunday meeting on the 17th with Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) Director Hoffman and ECA China Mission Chief Lapham. It is said that Truman was very pleased with the outcome. White House Press Secretary Ross stated that the two presented the President with a "progress report" on the $275 million economic aid plan for China. They stated that $70 million has been allocated for special reconstruction projects so far. Lapham told the President that the plan is "helping" to stop the spread of communism in the East.

White House Press Secretary Ross stated that Truman was "pleased" with the results of the plan to date and was happy to learn that the funds were also being used for the ECA program in North China. Assistance to China has become a major issue in the election campaign. Republicans argue that more economic aid should be given to this wartime ally as part of a global effort to contain communism. Dewey said last week that a Republican government would end "our neglect of old allies and friends."

Hoffman and Lapham declined to discuss the China aid plan with reporters beyond general principles. It is rumored that the ECA hopes to double the $275 million economic aid plan for China and allocate an additional $125 million to the current $125 million in military aid. Lapham spent four months in the Far East and recently returned to the United States. He plans to return to China in two weeks.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 17th] The ECA reported on the 17th that the total approved amount of ECA grants to China has reached $97,023,722 as of October 15.

Editorial

### Examining the Essence of the Yoshida Cabinet

Japanese politics have returned to calm after a storm. The Yoshida Cabinet, succeeding Ashida, will complete the appointment of its cabinet members today. Shigeru Yoshida leads a group of "newcomers" onto the stage, starting their journey under the attention of the Allied forces. Judging by the cabinet lineup, it seems like a single-party cabinet; looking at Yoshida's weight in the cabinet, he resembles a party dictator; considering his reserved attitude, stubborn words, and even the policies of the Democratic Liberal Party, we unreservedly believe that the Yoshida Cabinet is an extremely conservative cabinet, and the one with the most pronounced conservative character among the six post-war cabinets.

The Japanese media predict that the Yoshida Cabinet will be short-lived, and critics call Yoshida an extremely conservative and right-leaning figure whose political life will be brief. According to this view, the storm in Japanese politics has not truly passed; it will return intermittently and eventually topple Yoshida. In fact, this observation is not entirely accurate; the Yoshida Cabinet may stand firm and linger for a considerable time.

Judging the life of a political party and the life of a government cannot be evaluated solely by their conservative or progressive nature, nor can it be measured solely by the duration of time. One should assess them from the perspective of international politics and background relations to be more accurate. In today's Japanese politics, the left-wing path is impassable, and left-leaning parties lack strength. Therefore, the strength of right-leaning conservatives arises accordingly. The left and right cannot be equal, and the width of the middle road is too large, so the "middle politics" cannot stand between the left and right, which is an inevitable situation. The fall of the Ashida Cabinet illustrates the fall of Japan's centrist politics, and also shows that the background of Japanese political parties lacks the existence of this "middle" class. The Yoshida's Democratic Liberal Party and its current cabinet have relatively prominent political character and class background:

First, the Democratic Liberal Party advocates absolute free capitalism, opposes socialism and so-called revisionist capitalism, and is deeply supported by Japanese capitalists and zaibatsu. After the news of the House of Representatives' vote on the 14th to elect Yoshida as Prime Minister spread, the Tokyo stock market rose uniformly, indicating that the financial market welcomes the Yoshida Cabinet.

Second, Yoshida represents an old Japanese system. He relies on the court nobility and landlords as his pillars. The core figures of the Democratic Liberal Party mostly come from zaibatsu and landlords, or people who depend on capitalism for survival. Although Yoshida himself is a bureaucrat, he does not like bureaucrats or professional politicians. The Democratic Liberal Party's election expenses do not require extortion or corruption. It has the expenses of zaibatsu and landlords. The source of wealth for zaibatsu and landlords relies on exploitation and profits. The government only protects its exploitation and profits, so it does not rely on the government for corruption. Yoshida's cabinet has selected a group of newcomers, that is, seeking a group of capitalists and landlord representatives to take the stage, so he can boldly and confidently say: The evaluation of cabinet personnel is based on competence and integrity as conditions. This is the difference in political character and class background between the Yoshida Cabinet and the Ashida Cabinet. As for whether the Yoshida Cabinet is a short-lived cabinet, it depends on the cabinet's measures in the future.

Yoshida emerged representing the old Japanese model. He governs as the protector of the interests of zaibatsu and landlords. Its policies are biased towards the revival of old Japan, and there is no doubt that it will protect the interests of zaibatsu and landlords. The special parliament is currently underway. The biggest measure of the Yoshida Cabinet is to find a way to pass the amendment to the "National Public Service Law," and may use the pressure of the Allied Headquarters to suppress the Socialist Party's "labor offensive." Whether it is necessary to dissolve and conduct a general election after the parliamentary mission is completed is not important in Yoshida's view. In today's Japan, the power of conservative right-wing forces is generally rising. The victory of the general election may belong to the Democratic Liberal Party, which Yoshida is quite confident in. If he politically leans towards conservatism, deifies the emperor, economically suppresses labor unrest internally, and carries out East Asian economic co-prosperity externally, and focuses on the victory of the peace conference, he may gain considerable support. Although Yoshida is more stubborn than Katayama and Ashida, he is better at governing than Katayama and Ashida, thereby winning the hearts of the old Japanese people. When Yoshida was ordered to form a cabinet this time, he visited MacArthur twice, requesting that the Allied Headquarters personnel not interfere in Japanese politics and personnel; this shows that Yoshida has full confidence in the revival of old Japan. The Yoshida Cabinet lacks democracy and progress, which is inevitable. Its emergence is to lead Japanese politics towards a conservative path, and everything will gradually return to its former state!

### UN Tariff and Trade General Agreement Has Been Amended, New Member States Are Negotiating with Member States

Zhu Returns to Talk About Geneva

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Zhu Xie, the representative of our country attending the United Nations Tariff and Trade Conference in Geneva, returned to China a few days ago. According to Zhu's remarks on the 18th, this conference was divided into two sessions, one for the contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and one for the second session of the Interim Committee of the International Trade Organization. Regarding the former, two important cases were passed: (1) Thirteen countries, including Norway, Denmark, and Pakistan, which newly joined the agreement, should conduct tariff negotiations with each member state in accordance with the provisions of the General Agreement, mutually reduce tariffs, and establish a bilateral agreement, and it is scheduled to hold tariff negotiations in Geneva on April 1 next year; (2) Amend the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and replace Articles 3, 6, 13, 15, and 26 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with the relevant provisions in the International Trade Charter; (3) Allow the West German and American occupation zones to apply the General Agreement. The original intention of the United States was to propose West Germany and Japan at the same time, and request unconditional enjoyment of tariff reduction treatment by various countries. However, after China, the United Kingdom, India, the Netherlands and other countries objected, Japan was not proposed, but the West General Agreement is a separate agreement and has nothing to do with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. However, our country's representative did not sign to avoid Japan citing precedents in the future. As for the second session of the Provisional Executive Committee of the International Trade Organization, most of the resolutions passed were internal regulations and organizational matters of international trade. The two conferences lasted for six weeks. A few days ago, the countries that newly joined the General Agreement have begun to conduct tariff negotiations with various members.

### Truman Elaborates on U.S. Foreign Policy: Persevering in the Pursuit of Peace, Hoping for Soviet Understanding and Cooperation

[News Agency Report] Washington, 18th Broadcast: President Truman delivered a speech today elaborating on the United States' foreign policy, stating, "I have consistently used every opportunity to strive for peace, and this determination has never wavered. Whenever an appropriate opportunity arises, I will unite with allies within the framework of the United Nations to promote the cause of peace." Truman stated that the United States will dedicate its full strength to the cause of peace, upon which the fate of humanity rests. U.S. policy is not aimed at the Soviet Union; "On the contrary, we recognize that world peace depends on mutual understanding and friendly relations between the Soviet Union and democratic nations." Truman continued, "The firm stance taken by the United States should not be misunderstood as militarism. A firm stance based on reasonable grounds can give us hope for peace." Truman reviewed the U.S. foreign policy of the past two years, the main measures of which were three: (1) Providing military assistance to Greece and Turkey; (2) The European Economic Recovery Program; (3) Establishing a Western German economic organization in conjunction with the United Kingdom and France. He stated, "World peace and economic recovery cannot be achieved in a state of political instability, so we believe it is necessary to help stabilize countries with democratic traditions and aspirations." He stated that there is no hope for an early resolution of international disputes, but the United States absolutely does not want to use war as a method to resolve world disputes. "In international politics, new and serious difficulties are constantly arising, and the time when the great powers can form a world family is still far off." Truman called on the world to be patient, urging that international hatreds become a thing of the past. History shows us that "enemy countries can coexist peacefully in the world. When the entire fate of humanity faces a critical juncture, we must exercise the greatest patience. We should use every opportunity to strengthen the United Nations organization in order to undertake the arduous tasks at hand." President Truman's above speech was delivered at the annual meeting of the American Legion in Florida.

[Our Report] Paris, 18th Broadcast: The Security Council convened its member states on the 18th to hold a meeting at 10:30 AM on the 19th to discuss the new situation in Palestine.

### U.S. Will Not Destroy Atomic Bombs Until Effective International Controls Are Established: Austin Responds to Soviet Proposal

[Our Report] Paris, 18th Broadcast: U.S. representative Austin, speaking on atomic energy in the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on the 18th, warned the Soviet Union that as long as the communist countries remain closed off in a secret world behind the Iron Curtain, the United States will not be willing to give up atomic bombs, and the entire Western world will continue to rearm. Austin accused the Soviet Union of proposing the simultaneous destruction of U.S. atomic bomb stockpiles and the establishment of an international atomic energy control agency as merely a "tactic."

The intention is nothing more than to destroy U.S. atomic bombs before the world knows for sure whether the Soviet Union possesses such weapons. Austin stated that the United States has no intention of giving up its atomic weapons unless a fully effective control mechanism is established to guarantee that other countries do not and cannot acquire such weapons. Soviet representative Malik responded to Austin by repeatedly reiterating the old claim that the Soviet Union had made significant concessions, and condemned the fact that the United Kingdom and the United States had agreed to remain silent on the Soviet Union's atomic energy proposals. Malik concluded by saying: "Austin's talk of closed doors and iron curtains cannot explain why the Soviet Union's plan is unacceptable." He stated that the U.S. atomic plan has no intention of international control, "only for uncontrolled ownership and management, as well as U.S. monopolization of the production and development of atomic energy." Austin continued to attack the Soviet Union's secrecy, and warned that if the Soviet Union refuses to participate in world organizations and cooperate together, there can be no security. As long as this situation exists, the world will doubt the Soviet Union's motives and need to arm themselves for defense. Communist countries that want to live in a secret world are bound to prepare for war, and we do not want to live in such a world. This is the difficult situation faced by the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, he said.

[Our Report] Paris, 18th Broadcast: U.S. representative Dulles, who attended the UN General Assembly, stated at a press conference on the 18th after returning from his visit to Germany and Austria that the Soviet blockade of Berlin has caused a significant reaction favorable to the Western powers. He said that the Soviet Union's Berlin policy has produced the following five major results, all of which are beneficial to the West:

(1) The Western powers' adoption of airlift demonstrates superior capabilities and determination, making the world, including the Soviet Union, understand that the United States is capable of responding (2) The morale of the western districts of Berlin has been greatly boosted, and the German people are willing to endure the difficult winter in order to get rid of the Soviet Union's shackles. (3) Morale in West Germany is high, and residents are willing to bear new taxes to reduce the cost of airlift. (4) Information obtained by the U.S. authorities shows that morale in the Soviet occupation zone is declining. (5) The Berlin crisis has promoted increasing unity within the United States. Regarding the details of his trip to Germany and Austria, Dulles declined to answer.

### Six Preludes to the US Election: Miscellaneous Notes on US Election Regulations - Dewey's Victory is Undoubted

— Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing

[New York Airmail] The US election is just over ten days away, and the "horse racing tickets" in New York are selling at sixteen to one. These "horse racing tickets" refer to the presidential prediction lottery organized by various clubs. If you bet one dollar on Truman being elected, and Truman actually wins, you can win ten dollars. Conversely, if you bet one dollar on Dewey winning, and Dewey wins, you only win one-sixteenth of a dollar. It is said that these days, Philadelphia is only at eight to one, Chicago is probably around five to one, and the most amazing thing is that Truman's hometown—Missouri—has also reached four to one.

The overall situation of victory or defeat is probably already clear. The key question is, what will the election result look like in terms of proportions? Some say that this year, the result of the national "individual votes" will inevitably be an overwhelming advantage for Dewey, even exceeding the "sum" of all other candidates combined. Others say that Dewey's election this time will be an advantage like Roosevelt's overwhelming of Hoover in 1932. To express it with a Chinese idiom, it can be called "when water flows, a channel is formed," or it can be said to be "what the people want." Probably, Dewey's victory is no longer a question.

A few days ago, while covering the third annual meeting of the World Monetary Fund and the World Bank, I took a trip to Washington and indirectly heard secret stories from the White House, saying that Truman had already developed a nervous disorder, and his daily life, including eating and sleeping, was already different. This President Truman, who has the flavor of a Missouri farmer, probably knows seventy percent that his fate is "inevitable failure," and he is so anxiously flustered. During the campaign in the Midwest, he cursed the Republican Party, and his tone was even more outrageous than that of a "village woman." Back in Washington, he suddenly proposed sending "Vincent" as an envoy to Moscow, which made Marshall's hair stand on end with anger. The Washington newspapers are relentlessly mocking Truman. One newspaper said: "The Berlin crisis is about to fall apart, and the situation is so serious, and our President suddenly runs off to travel and campaign for such a long time. He is still leisurely kissing country children"!

However, according to people around Truman, the old man "insists" on being re-elected. Presumably, there is an addiction to being an official, and there is an unspeakable "wonderful thing" about being the president of a country. However, in another state of mind, he knows that his ability is not as good as Dewey's, his reputation is not as good as Dewey's, and his administrative experience is not as good as Dewey's. Recently, Truman went to Philadelphia, and on the guest signature book of "Independence Hall" in Philadelphia, he wrote "White House Communication Office," and then added parentheses, noting "temporary." His self-awareness and his "occupying" desire are forever at odds, which may be the real reason for his "nervous disorder."

The Democratic Party has occupied the White House for sixteen years, and Truman can be considered to have sung a closing performance. According to American political scientists, if a political party stays in power for too long, it will inevitably cause a split within the party itself. As a result, talents will cancel each other out, and eventually they will fail in the election arena. If this hypothesis is an inevitable phenomenon of democratic normalcy, then Wallace and the die-hard Southerners' departure is a prelude to the Democratic Party's defeat this November. Today, many insightful Americans believe that the Democratic Party cannot produce a decent "team." Truman's vice-presidential candidate is an old man in his seventies, and there is no other impressive figure. On the Republican side, there are plenty of talents, the lineup is neat enough, and Dewey himself is constantly talking about "unity and solidarity." The Republican Party of 1948 in the United States really has such a unified and united lineup, which is a difficult hurdle that Truman cannot overcome.

The election date is November 2nd. According to the US constitution and precedents, the quadrennial election is held on the "Tuesday" after the first "Monday" in November. The first Monday in November this year is November 1st, so the election is on the 2nd. Simultaneously elected with the President and Vice President are one-third of the Senators (i.e., Upper House members) and all members of the House of Representatives. There are ninety-six members of the Senate, and thirty-two will be re-elected this year. All four hundred and thirty-five members of the House of Representatives will be re-elected. In addition, thirty-two governors, state senators, judges, jurors, etc., will also be re-elected on the same day on one ballot. Therefore, all parties and factions are busy competing in the election, not only for the President, but also for the more important Senators and Representatives.

In the 1946 election for the Senate and House of Representatives, the Republican Party won a complete victory. The situation this year is slightly different. Generally speaking, the Republican Party has a greater chance in the House of Representatives, and the Democratic Party may turn into an advantage in the Senate. Ambassador Hurley, who lived in Chongqing for a long time during the Anti-Japanese War, is actively running for the position of federal senator (each state has only two senators) in New Mexico this year. It is said that he does not have much chance, because Hurley's opponent is former Secretary of Agriculture Anderson. Anderson is also from New Mexico and a Democratic Party member with status, while Hurley belongs to the Republican Party.

The number of members in the state Senate and House of Representatives is also related to the presidential election. This is because of the rigid provisions of the US "written constitution." The United States is a federal republic, so in theory, the citizens of each state can only elect the "presidential electors" of each state, and then the "electors" of each state elect the federal President. This system was established at the beginning of the founding of the United States—in 1787—and has not been abolished to this day.

After the rise of party politics, it seems more convenient for the people to directly elect the President than through indirect elections. Therefore, in 1808, all parties in the United States unanimously agreed that the "presidential electors" of each state should be divided into groups according to their party affiliation, and collectively elected or defeated. For example, according to the constitution, New York State has forty-seven "presidential electors." The Democratic Party nominates forty-seven names, and the Republican Party also nominates forty-seven names. If the people of New York State mostly vote for Dewey, it means that the Republican Party's forty-seven "presidential electors" have been elected by the people. Then, the "presidential electors" elected by each state vote for the federal government on a certain day in the middle of December (stipulated as the "Monday" after the second "Wednesday" in December) to formally elect the federal President and Vice President. This procedure was originally clumsy and redundant, but because it is a constitutional tradition, it has never been amended.

The number of "presidential electors" in each state is equivalent to the sum of the number of members in the state Senate and House of Representatives. For example, New York State has two senators and forty-five representatives, so it has forty-seven "presidential electors." Michigan has two senators and seventeen representatives, so it can produce nineteen "presidential electors." Nevada has two senators and one representative, so Nevada can produce three "presidential electors." There are a total of ninety-six senators and four hundred and thirty-five representatives in the United States, so there are a total of five hundred and thirty-one "presidential electors" in the United States.

To be elected President and Vice President, you must have more than half of the votes of the "presidential electors" (two hundred and sixty-six votes). Therefore, in the election arena, controlling large states and neglecting small states is a necessary strategy. In 1944, Dewey and Roosevelt competed in the election. In the sum of the popular vote, Roosevelt won fifty-five percent and Dewey forty-five percent. However, in the votes of the "presidential electors," Roosevelt alone won eighty-four percent. The former ratio only represents the degree of popular support, while the latter ratio represents the legal record. Roosevelt was the person most proficient in election thresholds. Now, Roosevelt has long been sleeping in the ground, and Roosevelt's former election rival is now standing opposite the Democratic Party. (Written on October 12 in Uptown New York)

### Heads of Counties and Cities Along the Two Railways Gather in Shanghai to Discuss the Principles of Guiding Materials, Adjusting Prices in Areas with Imbalanced Production and Sales, and Forcing Agricultural Products Exceeding Self-Use to Enter the Market

[Report from this Newspaper] In order to guide materials, the Supervision and Guidance Office specially convened a meeting of the heads of counties and cities along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways yesterday morning at 10 a.m., presided over by Chiang Ching-kuo himself. The attendees included the mayor of Hangzhou, as well as the magistrates of Wuxi, Songjiang, Taicang, Jinshan, Qianjiang, Jurong, Nanhui, Kunshan, Wujin, Jiangning, Jiading, Danyang, Fengxian, Shanghai, Changshu, Hangxian, Qingpu, Baoshan, etc. The head of the social affairs section represented counties such as Jiangdu. The important resolutions of the meeting are as follows: (1) Each county should continue to implement the "August 19" price limit, especially paying attention to agricultural products. However, in some places, if the prices between the production and sales areas are not balanced, reasonable adjustments may be made, all based on Shanghai's "August 19" price limit, and the pricing will be increased or decreased according to commercial practices in order to ensure smooth freight transportation. A plan for increasing or decreasing prices will be discussed and submitted for approval within one week. (2) In order to ensure smooth material circulation between rural and urban areas, each county should establish a material adjustment office to quickly collect statistics on the quantity of industrial products such as yarn, cloth, sugar, soap, and matches required by the county, and the types and quantities of materials that the county can supply, and report them to the supervisor's office for guidance on transactions. Farmers who sell their products at the limited price should be allowed to purchase industrial products at the limited price. (3) Each county should pay close attention to cracking down on hoarding of agricultural products in rural areas. If it is found that the quantity exceeds the quantity for self-use, it should be forced to supply the market. (4) Each province, county, city, and township is not allowed to act independently and block the flow of goods. Existing bans should be canceled immediately. (5) Counties near bandit areas should pay attention to strict blockades and not allow materials to flow into bandit areas. (6) Each county should pay attention to cracking down on black market transactions at any time, and black markets for gold and banknotes must be strictly prohibited.

### Cotton Yarn Shop Fraud Discovered; Attempting to Report More with Less; Manager Detained in Police Station

Yesterday morning at 7:00 a.m., Chen Zhenlin of Hongxing Cotton Cloth Factory at No. 92 Yaojiazhai, Hongqiao Road, went to Jinling Middle Road to line up at Yepin Cotton Yarn Shop to purchase cotton yarn, and was numbered 71. He purchased five small bundles of ten-count yarn, and the invoice was filled in as ten small bundles (that is, half a package). He instructed the factory stamp of Hongxing Cotton Cloth Factory to be stamped on the back of the invoice stub as a basis, hoping to report less with more and strive for yarn allocation from the China Textile Company in order to seek huge profits. Chen Zhenlin discovered this and seized the account book, and immediately reported to traffic policeman Zhao Haixu No. 3501. He checked the invoice stubs from No. 1 to No. 70 on the spot. Each person purchased five small bundles, and the invoice stubs were filled in as half a small package.

### Trial Begins in the Case of the Secretary-General of the Women and Children's Association Accused of False Accusation

Rescheduled to Review Counterclaim and Interrogate Again

[Report from this Newspaper] Ding Hao, the accounting director of the China Women and Children Relief Association, previously accused Zhou Naihao, the secretary-general of the association, of "forging documents" and "embezzlement" at the District Procuratorate. During the investigation at the District Procuratorate, the bureau filed a counterclaim against Ding, stating that Ding's behavior was improper and that he was suspected of drug use.

In the plea, he only stated that Ding's behavior was improper, and the mention of opium use was only for the prosecutor's reference. He also gave a statement regarding the claim of Ding's opium use. The court stated that it was necessary to review the counterclaim that Zhou filed with the District Procuratorate and adjourned the hearing.

### Reduced Portions of Meals and Dishes; Diners Mostly Unable to Eat Their Fill; Restaurant Industry Asks for Guidance on Food Supply

[Report from this Newspaper] The panic faced by restaurants in the city due to the difficulty of purchasing rice, oil, and vegetables is becoming increasingly serious. Up to now, more than 40 restaurants that are members of the Wine and Dish Industry Association have officially announced their closure. It is reported that dozens of other restaurants have requested the association for a temporary suspension of business. Because most of the small restaurants that previously specialized in lunch and dinner sets have stopped supplying them, the larger restaurants are extremely crowded during lunch and dinner hours every day, and more than 70% of their business is set meals. However, because the quantity of rice and vegetables purchased every day is limited, they have gradually shortened business hours or reduced the portions of meals. Now, ordinary lunches are all sold out at around 1:00 p.m., and dinners are all sold out at around 8:00 p.m. The portion of set meals is reduced by about one-third compared to before. Even the pork and beef steaks in Western restaurants are only the size of a handful, and there is often meat without vegetables or vegetables without soup, which diners find difficult to endure. According to the Chinese and Western Restaurant Industry Association, unless the difficulty in obtaining food ingredients can be resolved, this situation will be difficult to improve for a while. If they apply for a purchase certificate from the Social Bureau and go to the producing areas in other places to purchase large quantities, their business can barely be maintained. However, at present, various counties in other places have strict control over food materials, and it is difficult to transport large quantities out of the territory. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will find a solution as soon as possible or directly contact the producing areas to ensure an adequate supply and restore normal supply conditions.

### Authorities Discuss Price Control Issues; Unanimously Agree That Production Must Be Maintained

[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, Director Wu Kaixian, Supervisor Jiang, Xu Jiqing, and other seven people held a discussion at the Central Bank Supervisor's Office to solemnly discuss the increasingly difficult price control problem. As a result of the exchange of opinions, it was unanimously agreed that production must be maintained and that manufacturers should be able to have legal profits. The sources of grain and coal have been resolved. The rationing system for November has been decided to be implemented in order to stabilize people's livelihood, but the household registration still needs to be re-investigated. There is still a large stock of daily necessities in Shanghai, and it is believed that there will be no panic. It is hoped that the citizens will be at ease and will not disturb each other. After the meeting, according to the spokesman of the Supervisor's Office: the detailed method of rationing is still to be formulated, probably first rationing rice and coal, using household registration as the unit. There is no problem with the source of rice and coal.

### Prices of Newly Released Cigarettes and Soaps Should be Submitted to the Social Bureau for Approval

[Report from this Newspaper] The Social Bureau has strictly ordered all manufacturers that if there are newly released cigarettes, soaps, and fragrant soaps that have been released on the market after August 19, they must first send the product name, the proposed selling price, and samples to the bureau. The Social Bureau will then coordinate with the heads of the relevant trade associations to approve the price according to the competitive ratio and the same level of goods before they are allowed to be sold. Otherwise, they will be banned.

### No Cigarettes on the Market; Merchants and Factories Push Responsibility; Decision to First Implement Temporary Measures

Cheng Yikuan, the captain of the Anti-Smuggling Brigade, held a meeting of cigarette manufacturers at the General Bureau of Superintendence yesterday morning at 10:30 a.m., attended by Yao Shukun and Zhang Yuwen, the executive directors of the Cigarette Industry Association, Weng Ziyou, the chairman of the Cigarette Industry Association, Ye Jiru, the executive director, Chen Taiqiu (Yongkang Company), Lu Jialiang (Tianxing Heji), representatives of Chinese tobacco shops and retailers, and representatives of Yizhong Tobacco Company. First, Weng Ye and others from the Cigarette Industry Association reported that there were no cigarettes on the market recently, and it was not that wholesalers intentionally raised market prices, hoping to break through the limited price, but that there was no distribution of goods, and the actual responsibility should be borne by the manufacturers. Then, the manufacturers put forward various reasons to explain the lack of distribution of goods. After listening to the opinions of all parties, Captain Cheng decided that the two temporary measures stipulated last Saturday should be implemented first, and the detailed measures should be drafted and improved by the units present. According to wholesalers, Yizhong Company has decided to postpone the new distribution of goods until now.

It is now learned that the office has decided to first issue the difference money on the 19th of this month and distribute coal briquettes from the 20th. The procedures and locations for collecting the difference money and coal briquettes are the same as last month, and the deadline has been extended to the 30th of this month.

### Jewelry Lottery: Rumors of a Black Market, Sold Out Immediately After Issuance, Senior Official Requests Early Drawing

[Our Report] The jewelry lottery, just announced for sale on the 15th, has already been completely sold out by the Central Trust of China (CTC) Bureau and its various sales agencies. Although some lottery ticket shops in the city still have a small amount available, lines of eager buyers have also appeared in front of their doors. The fervor of the buyers is no different from the initial rush to buy daily necessities like rice and oil. The total number of these lottery tickets is only 600,000, and they must be distributed throughout the country, with Shanghai only receiving 200,000 to 300,000 tickets. Each ticket sells for only 50 cents, but it is said that many people are buying them in bulk, and there are even rumors of a black market where the price is at least double the face value. Officials at the CTC's Central Savings Society (CSS) have expressed surprise at the lottery's popularity. Originally scheduled to be issued every two months, the first issue was sold out in just two days, so the original drawing date of December 10th is being considered for advancement with a request to the Ministry of Finance. The prizes for the first issue are worth a total of 120,000 yuan. The CTC hired experts to estimate the reserve price of these jewelry prizes as early as February of this year. This time, for the issuance of the lottery, they hired jewelry experts in the city to re-estimate the value after the currency reform, according to the market value at the time. More than a month has passed since then, and it is generally estimated that the market value of these prizes is increasing daily, which has doubled the interest of the buyers. Yesterday, reporters inquired with the CSS about the issuance of the lottery. According to them, based on the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, the lottery sales agencies are divided into two types: special and default. Default agencies refer to national banks and bureaus. Their distribution is as follows: CSS 59,000 tickets, CTC 35,000 tickets, Bank of China 25,000 tickets, Postal Remittances Bureau 10,000 tickets, Communications Bank 5,000 tickets. Special agencies are contracted by five experienced firms to handle sales in various regions across the country. The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou region is contracted by Shile Trading Company, with a total of 240,000 tickets. The Sichuan-Guizhou-Hunan-Hubei region is contracted by Dadao Industrial Company, with a total of 65,000 tickets. The Pingjin region is contracted by Jinhua Company, with a total of 20,000 tickets. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Qinghai region is contracted by Chen Bainian, with a total of 40,000 tickets. The Anhui region is contracted by Xinye Company, with a total of 10,000 tickets. In addition, the Shanghai Jewelry Industry Association has also contracted 50,000 tickets.

### Current Residents of Enemy and Puppet Houses: Executive Yuan Approves Status

The Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Area Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office had doubts about the term "current residents" when selling enemy and puppet seized properties. The Executive Yuan has now approved the status of "current residents," and the Secretariat of the Yuan has notified the Municipal Government for public announcement: (1) The term "current resident" refers to the following situations: 1. Residents whose use has been approved by the Yuan and who have resided for eight years are considered current residents. 2. If the same house has been approved by the Yuan for use by two or more residents, and they have already moved in, they are considered current residents. 3. Current users who have moved in on their own are considered current residents. 4. Those originally approved by the Yuan for custody and use by various agencies, organizations, and schools, even if their staff members reside in them, are still considered current residents as the agencies, organizations, and schools. (2) If the same house is currently occupied by multiple residents, they should be notified to negotiate within ten days, with one of them purchasing it, or applying for purchase jointly. If they fail to purchase it within the time limit, it will be considered abandonment, and it will be publicly auctioned. (3) For those who reside in the houses of traitors, and who have paid repair costs approved on record before the promulgation of the Yuan's Measures for the Custody and Use of Houses of Traitors, they should be fairly compensated at the time of disposal, to the extent of the existing benefits due to the repairs.

### Citizens Prepare Photos Early: New Identification Cards to be Distributed Soon, Citywide Census to be Held on the 28th

[Our Report] Regarding the implementation of a comprehensive rationing system and the issuance of new national identification cards in this city, the concrete principles have been determined recently under the active preparation of the authorities. This time, the new national identification cards will be printed in conjunction with the rationing certificates. The format has been drafted by the Civil Affairs Bureau and will be submitted for approval before being delivered to the Central Printing Factory to be completed before the 28th of this month. A citywide census is scheduled to be held from the 28th to the 31st. The new national identification cards will be distributed to each household in advance by the district and bao leaders before the census. Citizens should fill them out according to the format, paste photos, and keep them themselves. At that time, census personnel will visit each household for review and collection. After compiling, verifying, and stamping them, they will be redistributed to each household by the baojia leaders for collection. The stamping and redistribution work is scheduled to be completed before November 5th. Yesterday, the Civil Affairs Bureau ordered each district and bao to inform citizens to prepare photos as soon as possible. The Social Bureau has also strictly ordered the Photographic Industry Association to inform all photo studios to abide by the "August 19th" price limit and not to raise prices opportunistically. In order to urge the swift progress of this matter, the authorities have specially formed a Preparatory Committee for Census and Issuance of Identification Cards and Rationing Certificates, comprising the Supervisory Office, the Municipal Government's Social, Civil, Police, and Education Bureaus, the Garrison Command, the Military Police Corps, and the Civil Survey Committee, to actively promote it. It has now been decided to set up temporary supervisors by district, with jia as the census unit. Each jia will have two census takers, and the city's more than 28,000 jia will require 56,000 census takers. Therefore, this census and verification work will mobilize 70,000 people, including existing baojia personnel and the Youth Service Team of the Construction Corps. At the time of the census, it is planned to implement a "static census" in the early morning. Traffic will be controlled throughout the city at the same time, with an estimated 10,000 military police mobilized for traffic control. The total budget is 500,000 Gold Yuan, which will be temporarily allocated by the Municipal Government, including about 300,000 yuan for printing the national identification cards with rationing certificates. Therefore, a processing fee will be charged for the new cards.

### Limited Gasoline Surplus: Only Enough for 600 Vehicles, Automobile Conservation Meeting to be Held Today, Re-examine Fuel Allocation Standards

The Municipal Automobile Gasoline Conservation Review Committee is scheduled to hold a review panel meeting at the Municipal Government at 3:00 PM today. It is reported that the meeting will re-examine the applications for additional gasoline allocations from those who only qualify for the basic allocation of ten gallons due to their status not meeting the regulations for private automobiles, and will determine the standards for vehicles that should be granted additional gasoline. However, according to the person in charge of the Committee, the remaining gasoline allocated to the city this month, excluding industrial and special allocations (such as for garrison vehicles, fire trucks, and ambulances), is only enough to supply 600 automobiles (calculated at the regulated amount of 50 gallons per vehicle). There are already 270 physicians who have been approved as eligible for automobile use according to central regulations, and after adding the gasoline allocated for the vehicles of heads of various agencies, the remaining amount is extremely limited. There are currently over 1,000 applicants for additional gasoline allocations, so the Municipal Government will implement absolutely strict regulations on gasoline allocation standards, and it may not be possible to grant additional gasoline allocations even for the vehicles of senators, National Assembly representatives, and Legislative Yuan members.

### Over 2,000 Tons of Copper-Nickel Coins: Hai Liao Ship Arrives from Japan, Hold Converted to Transport Returning Coins, Over 2,000 Tons of Copper-Nickel Coins

[Our Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Liao ship arrived from Osaka with over 2,000 tons of returned copper-nickel coins, including 2,144 boxes of nickel coins and 234 boxes of copper coins.

The ship arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday and berthed at the Huangpu Wharf for unloading. The ship is scheduled to continue to Kobe next Tuesday to unload bartered goods. Because the bartered goods need to be loaded with bulk tung oil, the ship plans to convert the cargo hold, and it is expected to convert three holds. Before this export, one hold was first loaded, so it can only load 120 tons of oil. When it is exported next time, all of it can be loaded, and it can hold 250 tons. The Hai Liao ship is a pioneer in transporting bulk tung oil to foreign countries. It is also learned that the copper-nickel coins to be transported back by the ship next time will be loaded in Nagoya.

### Perpetrators in Customs Bribery Case Escorted to Second Detention Center in Nanjing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Since the judgments of death sentences for Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Yuan in the Jianghai Customs bribery case were delivered, all three have separately applied for retrial according to law.

### Workers from Clothing Factory Cause Trouble on Trolley: Engage in Vicious Fight with Driver and Conductor on Changshou Road, Qiu Changjiang Injured While Mediating, Multiple Injuries, Four Suspects Arrested on the Spot

[Our Report] At around 9:15 PM last night, three workers from the Shanghai Clothing General Factory of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, numbered "10.2289" and others, took an British No. 16 trolley from Carter Road back to the factory. They got into an argument with the conductor, No. 536, for not buying tickets. When the trolley arrived at the Changshou Road Great Bell at the entrance of the Juyuan Restaurant, a fight broke out between the two sides. More and more workers from the clothing factory gathered, and the order became chaotic, causing traffic congestion. British and French trolleys No. 24 and No. 16 arrived one after another, and the drivers and conductors gradually joined the battle, making the situation serious. At that time, the authorities of the Clothing General Factory reported the incident and urgently dispatched the guard team to suppress it, but it was ineffective. Then they ordered Section Chief He and Director Zhang and others to rush to persuade the workers, but it was also ineffective. At the same time, Qiu Changjiang, the chairman of the British Trolley Workers' Union, personally rushed to the scene after hearing the report. While he was negotiating with the responsible party of the factory, he was stabbed with scissors by the opposing workers. In addition, the injured in the melee included the ticket inspector of French No. 824, the conductor of British No. 536, the driver of British No. 131, and another driver, Yan Fenghua. Two people from the clothing factory, numbered 16106 and 16474, were injured and sent to the Labor Hospital by the police. At the same time, Police Officer No. 2915 of the Putuo Road Police Station was also beaten indiscriminately while passing by, and has been sent to the Police Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, Shen Deheng, the chief of the Putuo Road Police Station in charge, rushed to the scene with Section Chief Zhu and a large number of police officers to suppress the situation after hearing the news. He arrested four workers involved in the incident on the spot, including Xie Jianqiu, Wang Yonghe, Sang Xingye, and Li Xizhong. The flying fortresses of the First Guard Team Headquarters also rushed to the scene one after another and found weapons used in the assault, such as knives, scissors, and stones, which were taken back to the police station along with the suspects. The arrested suspects are being interrogated overnight. Those with military status are planned to be transferred to the Garrison Command for investigation, while those who are confirmed to be workers will be sent to the judicial organs. After the incident, Zhou, the director of the Clothing Factory, personally went to the Putuo Police Station to express his condolences for the injury of Qiu Changjiang. Both sides expressed their willingness to settle the matter peacefully. As for the main offenders, Director Zhou will be responsible for handing them over for punishment according to law, and the medical expenses of the injured drivers and conductors will also be compensated by the factory. The two sides, together with the military and police authorities, began negotiations, which were still continuing at 1:30 AM this morning.

### National Grain Federation Calls for Exemption of Grain Business Tax

Wan Molin, Chairman of the National Grain Federation, recently sent telegrams to all national public opinion organs, asking them for support for the Federation's continued request for exemption of grain business tax, urging the Legislative Yuan to quickly review and approve it, so as to emphasize the importance of people's food. According to the telegram, the Grain Policy Committee of the Legislative Yuan has carefully studied the case of exemption of grain business tax and has already drafted a written report. It was also submitted for discussion at the tenth general meeting of the Yuan. The report listed a total of six reasons for exempting grain tax, believing that the rice tax must be paid at every level from rural areas to all cities, which has a great impact on rural areas, and may cause the phenomenon of grain being cheap and harming farmers or grain being expensive and harming the people. Moreover, the tax is a local tax with each administration acting on its own, which easily fosters the abuse of local exactions and continued collection. Finally, it proposed to change the method of grain collection to a one-time unified tax, the method being: (1) Restore the flour unified tax. (2) Levy a rice unified tax in accordance with the flour unified tax. (3) The unified tax should be limited to rice and flour. Other salt, flour, and miscellaneous grains will be exempt from tax and allowed to circulate freely when unprocessed. (4) The unified tax should be collected at rice mills, flour factories, and flour mills. (5) The unified tax can be sold back to the local government and belong to the local tax, but the tax rate and collection method should be in accordance with the central regulations.

### Old Woman and Son-in-Law Prosecuted for Blood Transfusion Fraud

According to Wen's complaint, at 11:25 AM on September 3rd, he got off the bus from the Shanhai Pass Road Station to the Xinzha Road Station. He was already ten steps away from the station when the defendant followed him, snatched his document bag, blocked his way, and said, "I know you never buy tickets when you take the bus. Even if you are the president of the court today, you must buy a ticket. The day before yesterday at 6 PM on Seymour Road, I also checked a person from the court. He had a court badge, I told him to buy a ticket, but he didn't, so I sent him to the Jing'an Temple Medical Inspection Bureau. If you don't buy a ticket today, I won't be polite to you either." He explained to the defendant that he had purchased a monthly ticket, and whether the court personnel purchased tickets or not had nothing to do with him. The defendant ignored him and still snatched his monthly ticket.

### Capital Outflow Tightens Credit, Market Interest Rates Continue to Rise, Capital Flight to the South Becomes Severe Again, Authorities Consider Curbing Measures

Yesterday, credit remained tight, and market interest rates soared to 0.9% to 1.5% per month. Long-term call loans even reached as high as 3% or more, which is unprecedented since the change of government. The cash panic is increasing daily. It is reported that before last month, the interest rate on cash call loans in the market was higher than that on promissory notes. The increased redundancy in the exchange of promissory notes in the city these days is a clear indication of this. It is also reported that large banknotes of 50 and 100 yuan are being discounted, and shipping companies are urgently seeking them. Due to the tight credit situation, banks and money houses have no overnight balances to deposit in the Central Bank. According to regulations, they cannot withdraw cash the next day, so credit within the industry has been extremely tight in recent days. Withdrawal limits for customers are extremely strict. Large banks are only allocating 1,000 or 2,000 yuan per account, and small banks are only allocating 500 yuan, or even 200 yuan.

[United Credit Reporting Agency] The outflow of capital to the south and to Hong Kong has recently become dangerously rampant again. Although the Ministry of Finance and the Guangzhou management authorities have repeatedly tried to curb it, the trend has not abated. The government will take emergency measures to severely crack down on it. Currently, funds flowing south are transferred in two ways: remittances and physical transport. Remittances are currently under control, with the total amount of remittances paid by paying banks limited to 200,000 yuan per day. Aircraft and ships are also being closely inspected for physical transport. However, the current difficulty is that some remittances are being transferred through counties near Guangzhou. Furthermore, it is not easy to thoroughly inspect the Guangdong-Hankou Railway for physical transport. Therefore, the government is now taking effective measures to address this and is determined to restrict it. It is reported that after the capital flows south, most of it is used to purchase goods, buy foreign currency and gold in Guangzhou, which greatly affects the black market for foreign exchange.

[Another Report] According to financial authorities yesterday morning, the problem of capital flight to Hong Kong has become severe again. Although the Economic Control Supervisory Office has strictly ordered investigations and interceptions, this phenomenon has not been eradicated. It is reported that the government is considering further discussions with the Hong Kong government in order to completely eradicate this situation. It is hoped that Hong Kong will assist in preventing the outflow of domestic capital to Hong Kong in the spirit of the Sino-British agreement.

### Ministry of Finance Announces Exchange Procedures for 29th and 30th Year Military Bonds

[Our Newspaper] Regarding whether the 29th and 30th year military bonds are still allowed to be exchanged and how to handle early debt repayment, the National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank has received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating: "Regarding the 29th year military bonds, if someone still wishes to exchange them, they may be allowed to do so. If it is a receipt for the military bond, it should first be verified whether there are suitable bonds in the Ministry's custodial account that can be allocated. If there are no such bonds in the custodial account, the holder of the receipt should be instructed to send the receipt directly to the Ministry for verification. As for those who previously purchased the 29th year military bonds and were issued the 30th year military bonds due to insufficient small denominations, when the bondholder applies for repayment in accordance with the procedures promulgated by the Executive Yuan, there is no need to investigate the reason for holding the bond. Repayment will be handled in accordance with the regulations and the double standard for the bond held."

The cotton cloth market is currently suspended by order, and the authorities are intensifying their crackdown on the off-market black market. Yesterday morning around 8 o'clock, brokers at the Paradise Tea House were investigated and dealt with, and the off-market shouts were immediately silenced.

It is also reported that the Cotton Cloth Business Association yesterday afternoon temporarily distributed the third phase, first batch of more than 80 types of cotton cloth from private yarn factories to dyeing and weaving industries.

It is reported that the second batch of cloth for the third phase has been decided and will consist of line tweed, velvet cloth, and quilt cloth, totaling more than 15,000 pieces.

### Sluggish Silk Market

The raw silk market remains stagnant, with no transactions in the market. The quantity distributed by the guild is still small, and applicants still feel it is insufficient. Sales at silk shops are still slow, and the trend remains firm, but due to quantity restrictions, most have no goods to sell. Raw silk transactions have not yet started, and holders are watching, with demand exceeding supply in the market.

Due to the depletion of raw materials, the supply of existing silk fabrics is also scarce. More and more customers from other regions are coming to Shanghai to add to their businesses, but factories are not opening up many goods, and most have no goods to buy, so transactions remain extremely sluggish.

### Quiet Overseas Sales of Chinese Tea

[Our Newspaper] According to authoritative sources in the Chinese tea export industry: Currently, Africa is quite fond of Tunlv and other teas, but because tea merchants there have already used up the foreign exchange recently allocated by their regulatory authorities, they must wait for the next round of allocations before they can start importing again. Therefore, overseas sales of Chinese tea have gradually declined and become quiet. However, holders are generally maintaining a steady attitude amidst the scarcity of both production and inventory, and the underlying market remains strong. As for Qimen black tea, the United Kingdom still intends to import it, but unfortunately, the prices are suppressed, so exports are also minimal. As for domestic sales tea, the Tianjin market is still lacking movement due to transportation issues. However, Taicang and the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou area each have sales, and market sentiment is generally stable.

### Rice Arrivals Become Active, More Than 3,800 Stone Arrive in the North and South Markets Yesterday

Rice purchased by traders from various regions is arriving in the city one after another. Yesterday, the South Market registered 831 stone arriving for dealers and factories, and 624 stone for rice shops. The North Market registered 1,297 stone arriving for dealers, 492 stone for rice shops, 150 stone for rice factories, and 448 stone self-managed by non-industry members (totaling 2,387 stone). The total arrival of goods in the two markets was 3,842 stone. Most of the above arrivals are directly supplied to retail outlets, so transactions in the market remain sparse. The South Market has prices for white japonica rice, thin japonica rice, Yangxian rice, Duxian rice, and Baiyuan rice.

No transactions in flour.

The grain market is dead. Soybeans, corn, Yuan wheat, etc. were not open. Only a small amount of sesame was sold. 20 bags of Poyang Snow Sesame were traded at 30 yuan, two bags per household. 300 bags of Kaifeng raw peanuts were opened by Ti Zhuang and sold to Xiaoyingfang at 32.7 yuan.

### Continued Studies and Return to Country for Self-Funded Overseas Students, Application and Repayment Methods for Loans, Ministry of Education Sends Letters to Relevant Embassies Hoping Students' Parents Prepare to Apply for Loans

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The Ministry of Education has decided to extend the loan assistance program for self-funded students studying abroad and the deadline for subsidies for return travel expenses to the end of February next year. The Ministry of Education has forwarded this program to relevant embassies in the United States, Britain, France, Switzerland, Canada, and other countries for handling, and the application and repayment methods for loans are agreed as follows: (1) Loan: A one-time loan of half the half-year living expenses, 450 US dollars, and the remaining half will be purchased at the statutory exchange rate, limited to one time. (2) A. Self-funded students who have been admitted and meet the following conditions may apply for a loan. Zi: Self-funded students who have been admitted by the Ministry of Education and have been studying at a foreign university and can complete one year of study before the end of February 38, and are willing to return to China at that time. Chou: Those who have not yet received the second installment of living expenses in foreign exchange. Yin: Those who are from poor families and are unable to purchase all foreign exchange for tuition and living expenses at the new exchange rate, and whose local embassy or consulate has verified that they are eligible to repay the entire loan within three years after returning to China. B. If any of the following two situations occur, in addition to repaying the loan and paying the interest due on the loan, the right to apply for travel expense subsidies will be cancelled. Zi: Those who are from relatively wealthy families and falsely report that they are unable to continue studying or unable to return to China, and are found to be true after investigation. Chou: Those who fail the course. (3) The repayment date is from April 38 to March 41, within a three-year period, repaid in full or in installments, converted into gold yuan at the statutory exchange rate at that time, and handed over to the Central Bank. (4) Guarantee methods: A. Store guarantee: Chinese merchants at home and abroad shall guarantee in their names. If the borrower is unable to repay, the merchant shall bear unlimited liability. B.

They must have a proper occupation and have a fixed salary income sufficient to repay the loan, and must be formally certified by the employing agency or company. If the borrower is unable to repay, the guarantor shall bear full responsibility. According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education: Because the personal store guarantee must be for Chinese citizens at home and abroad, and students are now abroad to save time, it is hoped that parents and relatives of students who are eligible to apply for loans will make the necessary preparations immediately, and hope to get in touch with the students so that the loan application can proceed quickly.

### Restoration of Original System at Beiping Normal University is Based on University Law Regulations

Spokesperson of the Ministry of Education Discusses Approval Process

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The spokesperson of the Ministry of Education said: National Beiping Normal University moved to Xi'an at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War and merged with other colleges to form Xi'an Provisional University, which was later reorganized. After the victory, due to the normal college system determined in the 28th year, it was renamed Beiping Normal College. After the change to the college, the alumni of the school repeatedly requested the restoration of the university. The Ministry has always attached great importance to its history and tradition, so in recent years, it has also repeatedly considered how to restore it in accordance with the law. If the normal school is to be renamed a university, in addition to the colleges of liberal arts and sciences related to normal education, other colleges cannot be added due to their different nature, so there cannot be three colleges in accordance with the law. (The College of Education was abolished early due to the normal school system) If it is changed to a regular university, it will not conform to the tradition of the college and lose its meaning. Recently, with the promulgation of the University Law, according to Article 4 of the new law, there are regulations that educational colleges established before the implementation of this law may continue to operate, and the Department of Education of Beiping Normal College is in fact the successor to the College of Education of the old Beiping Normal University, and may restore its original name and continue to operate in accordance with the law. The courses of the normal college are originally owned by the colleges of liberal arts and sciences of the university. If the colleges of liberal arts and sciences are set up separately, there is no inappropriateness. If the original College of Education is added, it has the scale of three colleges, which meets the provisions of the University Law that a university has three colleges, which cannot be compared with other normal colleges, and it can restore its university name. Over the past two years, the Ministry has repeatedly and carefully considered this issue, and has only recently been able to obtain this legal basis and approve the restoration, which was not easy.

### Law-Abiding People

— Thunder

I happened to see two absolutely different but somewhat similar news items in the newspaper. The incidents both took place in Japan, so they can also be regarded as a snapshot of Japanese society after the war.

The first is about a law-abiding person who starved to death:

"Tokyo District Court Judge Deguchi Yoshitada starved to death because he strictly adhered to the food control law. His will stated: Although it is a bad law, it is still a law; therefore, I dare to fight the black market and starve to death!"

The other is about a lawbreaker who was sentenced to death by the court:

"Ito Kosuke, a 17-year-old from Fukuoka Prefecture, lived a vagrant life and was recently sentenced to death by the Nagoya Court for killing two elderly women and robbing them of their gold jewelry."

"A murderer dies," the laws of ancient and modern China and foreign countries are almost the same, so Ito Kosuke's death sentence is reasonable and normal. However, the problem is that the person sentenced to death is only an underage 17-year-old child, and has always lived a vagrant life, which has led to two different opinions. Because I am not a lawyer, I can't talk about this. But what is most thought-provoking is the absolutely illogical fact that "law-abiding people die." However, this is a definite fact!

If we rashly put forward the slogan "law-abiding people die," we will inevitably be regarded as idiots or even insane, because of course there will be no such provision in the laws of ancient and modern China and foreign countries. But now there is indeed a judge who died because of "law-abiding," although the location of the incident was defeated Japan. The reason why this incident in Japan spread is probably because the dead person was not a civilian but a judge, so it attracted more attention. In fact, in the vast universe, I don't know how many people have been overlooked who "died" because of "law-abiding"!

Not long ago, we heard a new interpretation of "orderly and reasonable." This is not humor but a miserable cry. "Those with gold bars have reason." Conversely, without gold bars, there is no reason. Since the adequacy of the reason is directly proportional to the gold bars, may I ask how many truly law-abiding people have gold bars? Therefore, my first conclusion is: Law-abiding people do not have gold bars.

Also not long ago, I don't know how many people made a fortune from the victory. This includes the "confiscating" officials, the speculative merchants, and the powerful families who competed with the people for profit. They were truly in all shapes and forms, with a myriad of colors. These are all law-breakers. Law-abiding people are at the mercy of others, cut to the point where they can't breathe, and even can't maintain a living standard below the line. Public officials and salaried people all belong to this category. Therefore, my second conclusion is: Law-abiding people cannot live.

Again, not long ago, there were many people who made a fortune from the national crisis. Their roles were also of this type, both in the free zone and in the occupied zone. Law-abiding people can only be manipulated by others. Therefore, my third conclusion is similar to the second: Law-abiding people can only eke out a living.

Not having gold bars seems to be unrelated to life, but being unable to live and eking out a living are much more serious. Because the second step of being unable to live and eking out a living hides death.

How many people are currently unable to live and eke out a living? There are no statistics yet. But it is true that there are many, which cannot be denied.

Being law-abiding is such a noble behavior, but its only outcome is poverty, hunger, cold, and death. This is a terrible irony. To those who are good at exploiting loopholes, Deguchi Yoshitada's spirit of abiding by the law even if it means dying is idiotic and stupid, and it is also a major blow to law-abiding people, because the facts have clearly stated its consequences, although this is only a small incident in Japan.

Laski put it well: Before people can live comfortably, they must first live. I hope that all officials will not forget this superficial but true truth! Moreover, we are after all a victorious nation.

### A Blink of an Eye

— Lin

American scientists have attached a very small and light mirror to a person's upper eyelid. Then, using intermittent light, they illuminate the mirror once every hundredth of a second. This light reflects directly onto a photographic plate. Thus, the opening and closing of the person's upper eyelid is recorded on this photographic plate.

These scientists reached the following conclusions:

The average time taken for people to "blink" their eyes is four-tenths of a second - the upper eyelid takes five-hundredths of a second to close downwards; the upper eyelid remains down (i.e. the eye is closed) for fifteen-hundredths of a second; it takes two-tenths of a second for the upper eyelid to lift and return to its original position.

### Background

— Nanwu

When a few friends are chatting, and they happen to mention a person of some fame or status, there's often someone who puts on a mysterious smile and says, "So-and-so? Do you know what their background is?" They seem to take pride in possessing this "exclusive secret." And everyone is especially interested in things that are more private, so they keep asking. Then, that person says triumphantly, "Ah, he was originally a small carpenter!"

At this point, everyone feels deeply satisfied. Not only because they have uncovered another person's private matter, but also because they feel a sense of superiority - "Ah, my position now may not be as high as yours, my fame may not be as great, my wealth may not be as much, but my background is much better than yours." Ha, a person from a small carpenter background actually made such a fortune and had such good luck! Isn't this just a nouveau riche? What's so special about it!

And many celebrities are afraid that people will bring up their old stories. For example, in my hometown, there is an old painter who used to work as a clerk in a pawnshop when he was young. Because he had a lot of free time, he casually started to paint. Later, he actually became famous, but the first thing he did was to change his name and claim that he came from a family of scholars, never mentioning the word "pawnshop," as if it was a stain on his life. Once, a young student impudently asked him if he had any connection with a certain pawnshop, which was exactly where the old painter used to work. The old painter thought that the student was deliberately making trouble for him, and he got so angry that his beard stood on end, smoke came out of his seven orifices, and he slammed the table, knocking all the stationery and antiques on the table to the ground. In the end, he tremblingly kicked the student out, leaving the student completely baffled.

In fact, what's wrong with being a carpenter? What's so inferior about being a pawnshop clerk? Carpenters earn legitimate rewards with their own labor, and they are good men who are not ashamed before Heaven or man. And pawnshop clerks are also legitimate professions, and there is nothing shameful about them. Compared to the kind of freeloaders and secretaries who serve their masters' every whim all day long, workers and businessmen are far superior. Going from pawnshop clerk to painter is like a person who sells roasted chestnuts changing to sell roasted ginkgo nuts. They are both exchanging their services for money. What difference is there in status?

Among foreigners, the situation is exactly the opposite. We often hear that Edison came from a newspaper boy, Franklin was a poor apprentice with no place to stand when he first arrived in Philadelphia, and Lincoln's childhood poverty and diligent study are even more well-known. Those people chose a path that best suited their interests and ambitions, and they persisted through setbacks and achieved brilliant success. They never shy away from their past, and Lincoln's hard work and honesty became a major asset in his presidential campaign.

Other people's eyes look forward, and they value the "present." But we still have some people who are obsessed with the past, using every means to find an official among their ancestors as a joy. Even now, there are still people who are particularly concerned about other people's "backgrounds," and even now, there are still people who readily bring out "first ×× ancestral ×× (posthumous title) Lord," which is really sad.

### Returning Home

— Ding Daoheng

I idly calculate as I reach the autumn border, my feelings wane, disliking the peaks that are even more prominent than before. A task is still undone as I travel anxiously, several sounds call for the ferry boat at the crossing. The sorrowful weeping willows always accompany the traveler, the small birds struggle towards the sky. From here, the fishing village has pleasant breezes and sunshine, where the shade of mulberry trees provide a peaceful dwelling.

### Written Upon Arriving in Yangzhou

The wind... recognizing Yangzhou, ...car crossing Han... Han..., the people seem to have too much makeup, the mountains and rivers are worthy of imperial tours? Thousands of families blow pipes, the youth is boiling, ten miles of tea smoke at the early market. Only the remaining temple of the Southern Tang Dynasty Buddha, has seen the rise and fall, only lowering its head.

### "Undeliverable"

— Fang Bai

Persian postal regulations prohibit the mailing of razor blades to foreign countries. The British Post Office does not allow people to mail perfume to Basutoland (a British colony) in South Africa.

Lebanon refuses to mail fermented cheese or jam to foreign countries. Turkey does not allow the mailing of syrup and chalk-mixed flour. If you want to mail chalk for children to play with to Egypt, you must write the word "poisonous" on the box in Arabic or some other language.

Mexican beans cannot be mailed to India. Burma prohibits the mailing of bird skins to foreign countries, but ostrich skins for specimen making are not prohibited. Canada prohibits the mailing of live bees, and so does Bulgaria. And every year, except for the two periods from August 1 to September 1 and February 1 to March 15, mailing silkworm eggs in Bulgaria is strictly prohibited.

Guatemala in Central America refuses to mail fighting cock spurs to foreign countries. Colombia prohibits the mailing of tear gas spraying devices to foreign countries. The Dominican Republic on the island of Haiti absolutely prohibits the mailing of small daggers.

### Random Memories of the Book World

— Qian Dacheng

For the past ten years, I have visited and sought books wherever I have gone, and I have seen many fine editions. I have also paid some attention to the stories of the book world. This year, after lecturing, I have a lot of free time. Therefore, I will describe a few things to fill the "Free Talk" section. I will continue to describe them later.

I once saw two thick volumes of Qian Zunwang's handwritten and collated version of "Biography of Emperor Lie" in the home of my friend Pang Yunqi (Shilong). They were copied on ink-grid manuscript paper of "Preliminary Collection of Learning Assembled Annotations." The words "Learning Assembled" were left blank by one character. There were many corrections throughout the book, which was completely different from the current published version. I was ashamed that I could not borrow it from Yunqi to collate it. Yunqi exchanged this book with others for Bao Shenbo's couplets and other items. Zunwang's handwritten version is extremely rare. His manuscript of "Preliminary Collection of Learning Assembled Annotations" was formerly collected by Mr. Zeng Mengpu, but I heard that it has changed hands now.

My fellow townsman Yan Ruifeng, a book dealer, was a giant in the old book business. Ruifeng once purchased Zeng Wenzheng's annotated "Dan Kui Tang Poetry Collection" of Ji Xianjiu's descendants in the town. Wenzheng's handwritten notes were on the margins of the printed edition, with dense and fine characters, annotating almost everywhere. Xianjiu was Wenzheng's teacher. There was a "Preface to Master Ji Xianjiu's Fiftieth Birthday" and "Inscription on Master Ji Xianjiu's Gathering Orchids and Chrysanthemums Garden" in "Seeking Deficiency Studio Collection," one poem and one essay, showing their teacher-student relationship. However, the world did not know that Wenzheng annotated poems for Xianjiu. Even Xianjiu's descendants sold it among the chaotic books. Zhu Biezhi knew about this book. Ruifeng has been dead for several years now, and this book is very difficult to trace.

In the early years of the Republic of China, Zhao's "Old Mountain Villa" collection of books was intended to change hands. Ding Chuwo, Zhang Shuangnan, and Wang Jiyu planned to work together to negotiate and depreciate its value, but Zhao refused to sell. Mr. Jiyu and Shuangnan said that they would increase the price slightly, but Mr. Chuwo was reluctant, so they gave up. Later, it was finally purchased by Mr. Chuwo alone with his own funds. There were quite a few fine Song and Yuan editions, and the Yuan Dynasty Miscellaneous Dramas of the Yeyuan Old Profession were also among them. After Mr. Chuwo passed away, there was the Ding War of Resistance, and his collection of books was scattered. This matter was revealed to the world. Mr. Chuwo was a famous expert in the study of editions. I should write another article to praise him. (Editor's note: I once obtained Mr. Chuwo's collection of books from Suzhou Lengji, which was also an unexpected good fortune.)

### Salt Administration Expert Zhang Daishan

— Chen Zuogao

Most of the officials and celebrities of the early Republic of China have disappeared. One of them was Zhang Zhang Daishan, who was proficient in salt affairs and presided over finance twice. During the days when Xiangcheng (Yuan Shikai) seized power and the Feng Faction (Zhang Zuolin) rampaged, he once had a moment of prominence. There are some trivial things that are worth mentioning.

Zhang's original name was Mengao, his courtesy name was Daisu, and his other name was Master of Chaoguan Pavilion. He was a successful candidate in the late Qing Dynasty Renyin Imperial Examination. When taking the exam, he changed his name in his poem to Rihao, his courtesy name Daishan. When the list of successful candidates was announced, the news of his success reached his residence, but his family did not know that Mengao had changed his name, so they looked at each other in surprise. Zhang was originally from Shanyin, Zhejiang. His father, Du..., died in the official residence. When Zhang grew up, he stayed in Fujian to earn a living. His movements, habits, and language were all like those of a Fujianese. Those who met him always said, "I suspect that Zhang is not from Zhejiang." During the Xinchou year of Guangxu, my late paternal uncle Zu Xinquan served as the chief of the Nantai Copper Coin Bureau. Zhang and my father were colleagues, and they shared desks and meals. Soon, they were both transferred to the School Affairs Office. At that time, Rao Hanxiang was just a staff member of the Industrial Affairs Section. He looked at Zhang's face, and they spoke shallowly to each other and looked down on each other.

His family was always poor, and they lacked servants at home. Every morning, before going to the official residence, his wife, Madam Liang, would look in the mirror and comb her hair, while Zhang would tease his children and make them laugh, working hard like a virtuous wife. He once suffered from his wife's illness and delayed his exam for three years. Their affection was well-known in the neighborhood. After he passed the exam, he handled the documents in the Zhejiang Governor's office. He was impeached by General Chong (a Manchu), and eventually lost his official position. Through the introduction of Lv Chengting (a Fujian official), he entered the Jilin Official Transport Bureau, which was the beginning of his salt administration career. Not long after, Xiong Xiling was appointed as the commissioner of Salt Transportation for the three northeastern provinces. Hearing of his ability, he appointed him as a section chief. After the Restoration, Xiong was appointed as the Minister of Finance and Acting Premier. Recognizing Zhang's contribution to preserving the huge amount of money and seals in the Jilin treasury, he appointed him as the Salt Transport Commissioner of Changlu, and then promoted him to the Salt Transport Commissioner of Lianghuai. During this period, he planned the salt administration regulations, stipulated the detailed rules for increasing production, and adjusted the audit offices. His reputation was well-known. When the Xu Baoshan case arose, Zhang mediated and resolved it, and the matter was settled peacefully. He accumulated merit and was promoted to Vice Minister of Finance and concurrently served as the Director of the Salt Administration. At that time, Xiangcheng (Yuan Shikai) ruled autocratically. Those who were called talented among the vice ministers of the Beijing ministries were always Zi Hutong (Gong Chuo, Vice Minister of Transportation), Xu Youzheng (Xu Shuzheng, Vice Minister of the Army), and Zhang Daishan. They were called the three famous vice ministers. Xiangcheng consulted Zhang every day, and his courtesy almost exceeded that of the ministers. Later, after Xiangcheng died, Zhang Zuolin specially added Luo Zheng (a high-ranking official title) and began to belong to the Feng Faction, serving as the president of the Currency Bureau and twice as the Minister of Finance.

After becoming well-known and holding high positions, he frequently changed wives. First, he took a certain woman, who was Madam Liang's hairdressing woman. He was charmed by her, and she was favored and always accompanied him. More than two years later, he divorced the woman because she was crazy, and then married the hairdressing girl, who was very virtuous and lived with him until old age.

Some say that Zhang hid paintings, calligraphy, and editions, traveling north and south. He was usually humble and elegant, and he respected scholars very much. He admired Fang Dishan (Erqian), who was proficient in inspecting posts, and could pick up anything easily, so he appointed him as the manager of the Twelve Weir Warehouse in Yangzhou. Unfortunately, he loved gambling in his later years and eventually lost his family wealth, living in seclusion and depression. Before the Lugouqiao Incident, a certain official of the National Government's Finance Bureau wanted to promote the reorganization of the salt administration, hoping to achieve quick results. At that time, he was already critically ill and dying, and he could not be revived. He died in a narrow room in the Hutong of Suzhou, the old capital. Looking back at the past, it was like a dream. When Zhang lived in Jianyuan, he was superstitious about house physiognomy and often said to people, "A fortune teller said that my character, which is Yi Hai, Yi You, Yi Hai, Yi You, contains hidden titles. Those who are good at ending their lives are also in this character." In conclusion, he was still a salt administration expert.
