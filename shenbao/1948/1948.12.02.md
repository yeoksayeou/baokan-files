[Central News Agency, Gui Sui, 1st Dispatch] The National Army advancing towards Baotou along the western section of the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway crossed Saxian on the 27th and continued advancing rapidly westward. The Ningxia cavalry and infantry elite force in the west advanced directly towards Baotou with thunderous force. At 4 PM on the 29th, the National Army arrived on the outskirts of Baotou and immediately began the attack. The remaining bandits in the city fought desperately in the night. After a fierce attack by the National Army, they finally entered the city. The remaining bandits fled in disarray along the Yellow River to the south. Baotou City, which had fallen to the bandits on October 23rd, finally saw the light of day again. Furthermore, a dispatch from Gui Sui on the 1st reports that our troops sweeping through southern Suiyuan recovered Tuoxian county seat on the 30th, annihilating bandits retreating southward.

[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 1st Dispatch] The defensive battle on the outer periphery of Zhangjiakou, due to the successful major battles fought by the National Army at Kongjiazhuang (30 li west of Zhangjiakou) and Wanquan, had achieved a complete victory by approximately 3 PM on the 1st. The defeated bandits are splitting into groups and fleeing towards Laobeihekou (north of Wanquan), Huangjiabao (west of Wanquan), and the mountainous areas west of Huangjiabao. The fighting has now entered the mopping-up stage. This time, the Communist bandits exhausted their wounded remnants that had infiltrated Suiyuan, claiming to be the main force of the First, Second, and Sixth Columns, vainly attempting to infiltrate Zhangjiakou and isolate Beiping and Tianjin. Now, suffering this crushing defeat, their wild conspiracy has been completely shattered. According to preliminary statistics, in this battle, over 5,000 bandit officers below the rank of brigade commander were killed. The war booty is currently being tallied.

[Another Dispatch] Zhangjiakou, 1st Dispatch. The National Army annihilated bandits on the outskirts of Zhangjiakou. At around 1 AM on the 30th, a group of bandits disturbing the territory of Wanquan County launched a surprise attack on the National Army's position 5 li northwest of Pingmen outside Zhangjiakou City. After a fierce battle lasting about 2 hours, the remnant bandits, except for those who were annihilated on the spot, all fled.

[Another Dispatch] The National Army deployed on the outer periphery of Zhangjiakou recovered Guoleizhuang (60 li west of Zhangjiakou) on the afternoon of the 1st. Furthermore, the Beiping-Zhangjiakou Railway was cleared on the 30th without obstruction. Passenger and freight trains departing from Beiping on the 1st headed east and are expected to arrive here at 6 PM.

### Communist Bandits Attacking Miyun in Northern Hebei Repelled; National Army at Gubeikou Transfers to More Advantageous Defensive Position

[Our Newspaper, Tongxian, 1st Dispatch] Military News: On the 30th, the Lin Biao 11th Column, numbering over a thousand and equipped with several artillery pieces, attacked the outer periphery of Miyun. They engaged in fierce fighting with the defending troops overnight. At dawn today, they were repelled by the National Army. The remnant bandits fled in a northeast direction. The National Army is currently pursuing them. Since the strategic value of Gubeikou has become a thing of the past after the initiative withdrawal to protect Chengde, the National Army there safely transferred to a more advantageous defensive position on the 29th.

[Our Newspaper, Tongxian, 30th Dispatch] The great battle in eastern Hebei is still showing no signs of breaking out. The movements of the bandit army are still in the preparatory stage: (1) The communist bandits in the plains of Sanhe, Yutian, Fengrun, Lulong, Qian'an, etc., are using communication trenches to intensify their repairs, attempting to conceal their movements. (2) In the mountainous regions of Longmalanyu, Panshan in Zunhua, Yanshan in Jixian, and Pinggu, they are hastily digging anti-aircraft positions, making them enduring strongholds. (3) In order to inflate their strength, the bandits have greatly expanded their designations, such as county detachments being renamed guerrilla brigades and guard regiments being renamed guard brigades. According to a certain observer, the communist bandits in eastern Hebei currently claim to have eight columns, with a troop strength of approximately 100,000. This is still far behind the strength of the National Army, and they are frequently bombed and suppressed by the National Army's land and air forces, making their movements feel constantly threatened. Therefore, there are still no signs that a major battle will erupt in the short term.

### Madame Chiang Arrives in Washington; Mrs. Marshall and Others Greet Her at the Airport; H.H. Kung Visits Truman for Secret Talks

[Report from Our Newspaper] Washington, 1st Broadcast: Madame Chiang arrived here at 10 AM on the 1st from San Francisco aboard President Truman's special plane, the "Sacred Cow." Mrs. Marshall, Ambassador Wellington Koo, and other embassy personnel were at the airport to greet her. When Madame Chiang and Mrs. Marshall walked to the car, Mrs. Marshall asked, "Do you want to make a statement?" Madame Chiang replied, "No." Madame Chiang only stayed at the airport for a brief moment, waiting for news reporters to take photographs. After that, she and Mrs. Marshall drove to Marshall's private residence in Fauquier County, Virginia.

[Associated Press, Washington, 1st Dispatch] Madame Chiang is scheduled to stay in the United States for two weeks. Her itinerary has not been finalized, but she has been invited to stay at the home of Secretary of State Marshall and his wife in Leesburg, Virginia (built in the 18th century) for the first few days. Marshall himself has entered Walter Reed Hospital for a medical examination and will be hospitalized for at least a few days. As of now, Madame Chiang has not scheduled a meeting with Marshall or President Truman. American officials will naturally treat the wife of a head of state with courtesy. American officials believe that Madame Chiang's trip is not only to appeal for American government assistance but also to encourage the American people to pay more attention to China's position. At this time, Truman and Marshall seem to have agreed that it is inconvenient to involve the United States deeply in China's civil war. A cautious and limited aid plan still seems possible, but it is still undecided whether this plan will strongly aid the Chinese government. The American authorities believe that regardless of what kind of assistance Chiang receives, there is not much confidence in whether she can restore her power. The Chinese Embassy has also been unable to provide much information about Madame Chiang's itinerary. A press conference may be held once, but this is still awaiting her final decision. Madame Chiang will spend most of her time here at the Washington residence of T.V. Soong, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, as her office.

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 30th, United Press Dispatch] After an 8,000-mile flight on an American naval aircraft, Madame Chiang Kai-shek landed at the naval air station approximately 30 miles south of San Francisco at 11:16 AM on the 30th. Military representatives, Mrs. Muir, assistant to the State Department's chief of protocol, Zhang Suochang, Chinese Consul-General in San Francisco, and Admiral Kirk, former commander of the U.S. Navy in the Western Pacific, were all there to greet her. After getting off the plane, Madame Chiang remained silent to news reporters, refusing to discuss her call for the United States to provide full assistance to the Chinese government. Chinese sources said: Madame Chiang believes that her opinions are best expressed directly to Washington. Madame Chiang was then invited to lunch at the airport's senior officers' quarters, and then she drove into the city. She went to visit her sister, Madame H.H. Kung, Soong Ailing. At 8 PM that night, she transferred to President Truman's former special plane, the "Sacred Cow," and continued her flight to Washington.

[United Press, Washington, 1st Dispatch] When Madame Chiang arrived in the United States, news came from Shanghai that one of the Madame's purposes was to persuade Marshall to allow a senior American general to voluntarily come to China to command the anti-communist war. The news stated that President Chiang especially hoped that General MacArthur, General Clark, or General Wedemeyer would go to China. It was also reported that Secretary of Defense Forrestal had asked Truman to grant President Chiang's request, but Marshall did not agree.

[Our Newspaper, Washington, 30th Dispatch] Dr. H.H. Kung visited President Truman at the White House at 3 PM on the 30th for a meeting lasting approximately half an hour. After leaving the Presidential Office, he met with White House news reporters and said that his visit to the American President was a routine courtesy call. When asked if he had mentioned the issue of immediate aid to China, Kung replied that he had discussed world issues with the President in addition to extending his regards. Members of the press inferred from the duration of Kung's meeting with Truman that there must have been extremely important discussions between the two, but Kung remained silent throughout.

### Discussions on Aid to China Plan with Lapham; Hoffman Scheduled to Visit China; First Batch of U.S. Transferred Fighter Planes for Our Air Force Being Crated

[Economic Cooperation Administration, Our City Dispatch] The headquarters of the Economic Cooperation Administration in Washington recently announced that the head of the Economic Cooperation Administration, Hoffman, will arrive in Shanghai on December 11th to discuss the US aid to China plan with Lapham, head of the China branch.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 30th Dispatch] Hoffman's visit to China will particularly focus on the problem of food supply to major cities in China. Although the Economic Cooperation Administration has stopped its food supply program to Taiyuan, it still continues to supply wheat and rice to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Shantou, Qingdao, and Beiping.

[Associated Press, Washington, 30th Dispatch] Hoffman's trip to China is likely a prelude to expanding the aid to China plan. The trip is closely related to the fact that Chaer and Lai Jifu, investigators from the Congressional Supervisory Committee on the aid to China plan, returned here from China, and Hoffman followed them on the trip.

[United Press, Washington, 30th Dispatch] Hoffman's announcement to go to the Far East occurred on the eve of Madame Chiang's arrival in the United States to call for more aid to China. Hoffman will return to the United States on December 20th. Hoffman's report will guide the American administrative authorities' response to Madame Chiang. Hoffman's headquarters said that Hoffman will travel to the Far East via the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, he will have a brief meeting with officials from the European Recovery Program. Hoffman is scheduled to take a Pan American Airlines plane to the United Kingdom on December 4th, stay in the United Kingdom for four days, and arrive in Shanghai on December 11th. After that, he will have a series of meetings with Lapham, head of the China branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration. Hoffman will travel with his special assistant, Li Quesi, and will also travel to Korea before returning to San Francisco via Tokyo on December 18th.

At the same time: The US State Department said on the 30th that of the $125,000,000 in military aid to China plan approved by Congress this spring, China has already spent $113,798,326, leaving only $11,201,674.

[Associated Press, Grant Fort, Texas, 1st Dispatch] Workers at the Texas Engineering and Manufacturing Factory began crating the first batch of P-51 Mustang fighter planes to be transferred to the Chinese Air Force on the 1st. The company authorities announced that they had signed a contract with China to ship 95 planes to the Chinese government as part of the aid. The planes flew here from Rintroff Airport in San Antonio, Texas. All the planes in the company will be fitted with electrical paint, disassembled and crated. The national emblem of the Chinese government will replace the emblem of the US Air Force. According to company staff: they hope to complete the order within six weeks.

[Agence France-Presse, Vancouver, 30th Dispatch] The Canada Solar Shipyard had built several troop transport ships for the Nanjing government, which were driven to China for delivery by Canadian sailors. According to their return claims, there were major errors in the construction of these ships. When Transportation Minister Chevrier was asked about this today, he replied that this statement was absolutely incredible because all the ships had been carefully inspected before sailing to China.

### Bullitt Arrives in Hong Kong; Scheduled to Return to the United States Tomorrow

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 1st Dispatch] Mr. Bullitt arrived here from Guangzhou this morning. He refused to make a statement to the press and is scheduled to return to the United States on December 3rd.

### The Siege of Xuzhou: The Overt and the Covert Sides

— Our Reporter Ding Weidong

The great battle east of Xuzhou effectively came to an end on the 25th of last month. Huang Botao's army corps, having suffered a bitter defense at Nianzhuang, broke through and joined up with Qiu Qingquan's army corps. The main force of Chen Yi's army, having suffered losses, began a strategic retreat. From this, it can be seen that the great enemy that the National Army has to deal with today is truly a formidable opponent. Even as the Ministry of National Defense announced a great victory, Chen Yi's main force quickly moved south, coordinating with Liu Bocheng's army, which was entrenched in Suxian, threatening the gate to the capital—Bengbu. In order to cope with this new situation, the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters also made a major decision, moving the main force of the National Army and the entire Pacification Headquarters to Bengbu, with Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi stationed there to command. Xuzhou was changed to a command post, headed by General Du Yuming. From a military perspective, this was a very brave and timely action. Because when the eastern front was in fierce battle, Liu Bocheng took advantage of the situation to descend on Suxian, and Xuzhou effectively became a besieged city. Even after the victory on the eastern front, communist troops remained within dozens of miles around, and everything depended on air transport for support. Based on the experience of Changchun, it can be known that air transport is an extremely expensive endeavor, and the country's financial resources today cannot bear the long-term burden. The future and safety of Xuzhou depend entirely on whether the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway can be opened up as a means of cutting off the Communist's supply lines. Another consideration is that the National Army is at a disadvantage in terms of troop strength. What it relies on to win is its strong firepower and good training. In the decisive battle in Bengbu and Suxian, it also needs to concentrate its forces. Therefore, General Liu Zhi received an urgent summons from Nanjing at 2:30 AM one day, and the authorities personally gave him instructions. Starting from the 26th of last month, troops and supplies from Xuzhou were continuously transported south to Bengbu, and the entire situation changed. Xuzhou temporarily lost its importance in strategy. The reporter arrived in Xuzhou on the 25th of last month and left Xuzhou late at night on the 29th to return to Nanjing. Within these few days, I witnessed various changes and deeply felt the impermanence of the fate of war and the calm of the general public in coping with the dangerous situation.

In the Storm

Before the storm arrived, Xuzhou City was indeed in a state of panic for a time. The passenger cars heading south on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway were more crowded than the Beijing-Shanghai Railway during the final period of price controls. Humans have an innate instinct to survive, and those with wealth especially cherish their lives. Among these refugees, most were wealthy merchants and those who were able to move, accounting for about one-seventh of the total number of citizens. About 200,000 people remained, embracing an attitude of leaving everything to fate, and guarding the endangered city. In fact, in the three years of the suppression of the rebellion, the flames of war had approached Xuzhou more than once. The calm attitude in times of danger is partly due to the temperament of the Chinese people and partly because experience has tempered them.

When the tide of war fully attacked Xuzhou, the scene was terrifying. After Jiawang was abandoned, the power supply to Xuzhou City was cut off, and the whole city was plunged into darkness. The climax of the battle was on the 10th and 11th of last month, when Chen Yi's troops approached Xuzhou from the north, southwest, and west. The air force base 20 miles southeast was also shelled. The sound of machine guns could be heard all night, as dense as a sudden rain, and the cannon fire shook so violently that the glass windows of civilian houses were shattered. This was the most tense moment of the Xuzhou defense battle, caused by the unusual movements of some troops, which allowed the Communist troops to approach Xuzhou City. Later, the main force of the National Army moved east, and the battle gradually expanded to the outer periphery. This famous city in East China was unexpectedly spared the baptism of artillery fire. In retrospect, the fact that Xuzhou was able to escape this ordeal was certainly due to the soldiers' dedication, but the internal peace and the people's calm were also important reasons. According to General Tan Fulie, commander of the Xuzhou Garrison: In every major battle, the two things he feared most were a military mutiny and the rear area descending into chaos first, such as shooting and arson at night. The loss of Yanzhou and Jinan, in addition to external reasons, often occurred when internal disturbances broke out at the critical moment, resulting in one person shouting at night, and those in chaos followed. The morale of the troops in the front was flustered, and the defense line collapsed without being attacked. In this decisive battle in Xuzhou, all the soldiers who could fight were transferred to the outer periphery, and the interior was unusually empty, but throughout the entire operation, there were no incidents of night-time shooting or sabotage in the city. The reason for this is entirely due to the strict household registration and Baojia system on weekdays. Every family in Xuzhou had a family photo stored in the garrison headquarters, the police station, and the Baojia chief's office, which were checked at any time to prevent criminals from mixing in. Because there was this organizational foundation, it was able to stabilize the people's hearts in times of danger and help Xuzhou through this ordeal. (The text continues on page 4)

### Director Dong Declares on Behalf of the Government: No Consideration Given to Moving the Capital; Central Government Agencies Have Made No Preparations for Relocation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, Dong Xian Guang, issued the following statement on the 1st: Recently, rumors have been rife about the possibility of the government moving the capital. I hereby solemnly declare on behalf of the government that these rumors are completely unfounded. The government has never discussed the issue of moving the capital. Currently, in the ongoing battles on the front lines, our national troops have selected favorable terrain to lure and annihilate the communist bandits on a large scale. The morale of the troops is extremely high. Our loyal and brave soldiers are writing this glorious page in the war history of our nation. Both Chinese and foreign reporters who have gone to the front lines to observe the war are invigorated by this. I would like to solemnly declare that since the central government has no plans to move the capital, the central government agencies have also made no preparations for relocation. The government needs all civil servants to remain at their posts and maximize their work efficiency to achieve the task of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. There are absolutely no plans for large-scale layoffs. However, in order to reduce the expenses for food and materials in the capital and to stabilize the morale of government personnel, the government is considering providing assistance to civil servants who wish to send their families back to their hometowns.

[United Press, Nanjing, 1st] A spokesman for the U.S. Military Advisory Group told the United Press on the 1st that the head of the group, General Barr, went to Shanghai to inspect the port facilities in Shanghai, and not to discuss the withdrawal of the U.S. Joint Military Advisory Group officials from Nanjing and Shanghai.

Editorial

### Eliminate the Dregs in the Rear!

The Chinese and foreign press corps returned from visiting the Xuzhou front lines. Whether in their military reports or in the news photos they took, they all showed the strong morale of the national troops on the front lines, fighting hard to defend the country and the nation, as well as the safety of order in the Xuzhou area, and the cooperation between the military and civilians, which far exceeded the expectations of the people in the rear. This is the fundamental reason for the great victory in the Battle of Xuzhou, and also an important factor that allows us to be optimistic about the future of the military suppression of the rebellion.

However, despite the fact that the soldiers on the front lines are fighting desperately and good news is frequently reported, the people in the rear are restless and anxious, especially the people in the upper class. They have been attacked by the communist bandits and their Fifth Column's propaganda offensive. They believe that they have access to inside information and have superior insights. Holding the mentality that "a dangerous country is not to be inhabited," they have flocked to leave and fly far away. Some are preparing to flee overseas, and some want to take refuge in Hong Kong. They are also vying to spread the news, one telling ten, and ten telling a hundred. The general public is also unsettled by the calls for "evacuation." How can the "higher-class Chinese" (?) in the upper class, who are so flustered and so useless, have the right to demand that the country and society guarantee their remaining assets? We have witnessed this situation of "worried fools disturbing themselves," and then heard the unanimous reports from the Chinese and foreign press corps, and we are truly filled with mixed feelings. The soldiers on the front lines are fighting hard and regarding death as going home, while the people in the rear are fleeing in a panic, scrambling to be the first to escape. This stark contrast is truly laughable!

In reality, these "higher-class Chinese" usually live in luxury and act like they are in charge, as if the whole world belongs to them. Once the country is in danger, they are the first to run away. They neither contribute effort nor money, and they fantasize that other fools will protect their remaining property. They even dream of sending people to contact and collude with the communist bandits, and make provisions for their own safety. How absurd is their delusion!

When Jinan fell and the Northeast's important flags were abandoned one after another, the people in the rear were all heartbroken that some of the defending troops had failed to fulfill their duty to defend the country and had let down the eager expectations of the people in the rear. However, in the Battle of Xuzhou-Bengbu today, when the soldiers are fighting desperately, some people in the upper class are disregarding the nation and the country and are vying to fly far away. How can they face the soldiers who are fighting and bleeding on the front lines! This behavior not only exposes their ugly selfishness, but also disturbs the public and affects the morale on the front lines. Whether in Nanjing or Shanghai, this group of people who only want to escape and make no contribution are all dregs in the rear and moths of the country. We must point out the despicable nature of this selfish behavior, and especially encourage patriotic compatriots in the rear to arouse their conscience and emulate the loyal and brave soldiers on the front lines.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the government resolutely engaged in the war to suppress the communist bandits and quell the rebellion, which cannot be equated with ordinary civil wars in other countries or internal turmoil in history. The communist bandits' armed rebellion was indeed intended to seize power by force, but because it has an international background, it is actually part of a world revolution promoted by a certain country. Our people must not regard it as an ordinary political party in a democratic country. Its success is our nation's failure; its victory is our country's demise. At present, the communist bandits' momentum is growing, and the territory they occupy is increasing. Even their troops, running rampant, have penetrated the Honghuai River basin and are poised to attack the heartland of our government. We do not want to be alarmist, and we are absolutely not defeatists, but we must frankly point out that the major battle currently underway between Xuzhou and Bengbu has a major impact on not only the safety of the Jianghuai River basin, but also the future of the entire military suppression of the rebellion. The soldiers and people along the Nanjing-Shanghai line must rise up together, cooperate closely, contribute money if they have money, contribute effort if they have strength, and display the strong spirit of defeating Sun Chuanfang in the Battle of Longtan and resisting the Japanese army for three months in the Battle of Shanghai on August 13th, so that we can turn danger into safety and guarantee the final victory.

Re-examining the crux of past military failures, in a nutshell, it lies in the disconnect between the army and the people, and even mutual recrimination. How to reverse the military decline in the future? The first priority is to restore the spirit of unity between the military and the people during the Anti-Japanese War. This Battle of Xuzhou has restored the confidence of the army, proving that the army is definitely not unwilling to fight hard battles. Therefore, from now on, we should ask more from the people in the rear, and especially take the initiative to eliminate all corrupt dregs, so that the entire society can remain calm and composed, support the soldiers, and fight the bandits to the death. We believe that under the conditions of military-civilian cooperation, not only can the Honghuai River be defended, but the lost territories of Shandong and the Northeast can also be gradually recovered. In short, if we want to reverse the military decline, strengthen the assistance of friendly nations, strive for the final victory, and guarantee the independence and freedom of the nation and the country in the future, the responsibility lies with us, the people in the rear, to establish a firm belief in self-salvation and national salvation!

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] After the Nanjing Zijinshan Observatory recently discovered a large comet, it has attracted the attention of people across the country. According to Professor Dai Wensai of the Tsinghua University Astronomy Department, this comet is very large. It can be seen in the morning with a telescope with a diameter of 3 inches.

### Learn from the Soldiers at the Front: The Reality of "An Inch of Territory, an Inch of Blood" Reappears in the Xuzhou Campaign

Deng Wenyi Publishes Proclamation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st dispatch] Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Work Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, published an article "Learn from the Soldiers at the Front," which is recorded below:

The Xuzhou Campaign, after twenty days of fierce fighting, has reached the end of its first phase. However, the Battle of Suxian, south of Xuzhou, is still ongoing. As the National Army continues to make careful deployments, the battle may be extended to achieve even greater victories. The concern of the national military and civilians for this campaign may even exceed that of the early days of the War of Resistance, because with the fall of the Northeast again, the country has reached the final moment of crisis. If the Communist bandits were to achieve a lucky victory in the Xuzhou Campaign, then Jinghu and even the Yangtze River basin would inevitably be subjected to the disaster of war. I believe that all the people in the country will be aware of this serious fact in their hearts.

The bravery and sacrifice of the National Army soldiers in the Xuzhou Campaign are almost unbelievable to those who have not personally experienced it. I stayed in Xuzhou for half a month and visited the front-line positions several times. Here, I would like to give a faithful and accurate report to the people of the country on what I have seen with my own eyes and what I have heard from wounded soldiers and captured bandit soldiers in a simple and concise manner.

Under the direct instructions of the Communist International and the Communist Central Committee, Liu Bocheng, Chen Yi, and Chen Geng's bandit troops launched this crazy and predatory war, concentrating all the forces of the Communist bandits south of the Yellow River and north of the Yangtze River, mobilizing more than 500,000 bandit troops, including 19 columns and 4 independent brigades under Chen Yi's command, totaling about 400,000 people, and 7 columns and 3 military region brigades under Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng's command, totaling about 150,000 people. However, the National Army's morale was strong, and officers and soldiers had the conviction to win and the determination to sacrifice. In addition, with the cooperation of the Air Force, the National Army finally displayed a great revolutionary spirit and defeated the main force of the bandits in front of them.

During the campaign, all the officers and soldiers of the National Army were able to sacrifice heroically, advancing wave after wave, surpassing any campaign in the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance. The people of Xuzhou and its vicinity, inspired by the heroic National Army, automatically implemented a scorched-earth policy. The common people in the war zone, regardless of gender or age, voluntarily left the battlefield, preferring to live as refugees rather than be coerced by the Communist bandits. The cooperation between the military and the people could not be better. Forty citizens and more than 100,000 refugees in Xuzhou City contributed their greatest strength to support this campaign, because they all understood that this war was a war against aggression and enslavement, and also a war of their life and death.

I have seen and heard that the National Army on the battlefield has created thousands of heroic deeds of sacrificing themselves generously, facing death calmly, and regarding death as going home. The reality of "An inch of territory, an inch of blood" has reappeared in the Xuzhou Campaign. Their sacrifice is tragic and fierce, and its price and consequences are even more glorious and far-reaching.

The Impact and Performance of the Campaign

As for the impact and performance of this campaign, in simple terms, there are the following points:

First, due to this Xuzhou Campaign, the true meaning of the bandit suppression and pacification war has been clearly demonstrated. If the soldiers and civilians at the front did not truly understand that this war was directly related to the survival of the country and the nation, I think perhaps we would not have achieved such great results so quickly. The results of this war, exchanged for such great sacrifices, will surely awaken all the people of China, who will jointly participate in the war of the entire nation against aggression, enslavement, survival, and freedom. At the same time, it will also make the people of the world understand the conspiracy and cruelty of the Communist International and the Chinese Communist bandits. This is already a war of democratic countries, not just a domestic war in China.

Second, the direct result of this campaign is that the blood of 70,000 National Army soldiers has shattered the Communist bandits' conspiracy to capture Xuzhou in one fell swoop and defeated 12 columns and 34 divisions of the Communist bandits (of which the 7th and 10th columns have been completely defeated by us). The remaining dozen or so columns have been severely hit. According to the bandit army's column reorganization, temporary troop replenishment, and battlefield corpses, and the confessions of prisoners, the total number of bandit army casualties is at least 200,000, which is three times the number of National Army casualties and two-fifths of the total force of the Communist bandits attacking Xuzhou. This will give the Communist bandits a serious lesson, so that they know that the spirit of the Chinese nation and the National Army cannot be subdued or defeated by their means of conspiracy, instigation, deception, and incitement.

Third, this campaign has touched the hearts of all Chinese people. We have seen the fervor of celebrations in various places during the campaign, and the unprecedented scale of the consolation movement in various places when the campaign came to an end. In the two cities of Jinghu, materials worth hundreds of millions of Gold Yuan were raised within ten days as in-kind condolences. In particular, the first and second consolation groups organized by representatives from all walks of life in Jinghu quickly arrived at the front line. In addition to cigarettes, sugar, and vegetables, each officer and soldier was given two silver coins of comfort money on the spot, as well as cigarettes, sugar, vegetables, gloves, socks, and towels. All kinds of hospitality, care, condolences, and encouragement were provided to the wounded soldiers. These things were rarely seen during the War of Resistance. This is very satisfactory and gratifying to the soldiers at the front. It is hoped that such a consolation movement will be universally launched and responded to throughout the country, because the time has come for everyone to contribute money and effort.

Fourth, this campaign has stabilized the hearts of the people and the order of the rear in the whole country. The psychological attitude of panic, speculation, opportunism, standing by and watching, and gloating over misfortune of most people has changed. From this, we know that only by standing up straight, standing firm, fighting against the Communist bandits, implementing bankruptcy and protecting property, and desperately protecting life, regardless of age or gender, regardless of north, south, east, or west, can we save the country, resist communism, and save the country. From now on, this is our only way to survive.

Fifth, this campaign will soon let the world know that China's war against aggression today is a continuation of the past War of Resistance, a war to fight for China's independent survival, and also a war for world freedom and peace. The United Nations should make a choice, and the United Kingdom and the United States should take action; on the other hand, it will also let the Communist International Group know that it is not easy to invade China, communize China, and destroy China. The patience of the Chinese people is limited, and the Chinese soldiers still have strength. If the Communist International and the Communist bandits gain an inch, they will definitely encounter strong resistance and be subjected to a blow by our heroic military and civilians.

Sixth, this campaign has established the belief of the Chinese soldiers in victory. Because of this victory and such a major bloodshed sacrifice, we can definitely reverse the war situation and save the situation. The wise leadership of the Supreme Commander President Jiang is worthy of the loyal support of the people of the country. The confidence of the soldiers has been restored from now on. No matter how the Communist bandits slander and vilify our revolutionary soldiers, we have now answered them with facts and actions. The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of the soldiers. The National Army can only restore the revolutionary spirit, carry forward the glorious history, and strive for the thorough victory of this war with the attitude of inheriting the past and ushering in the future, learning from the heroic battles of the officers and soldiers of the Xuzhou campaign, advancing on the bloodstains of the martyrs, and becoming successful or benevolent. This is a good example of turning defeat into victory, turning defense into offense, suppressing banditry, saving the country and seeking survival. The Xuzhou Campaign is the best model battle in China's war of independence.

Based on the above facts and influences, we can understand the value of the Xuzhou Campaign. The blood of the soldiers has not been shed in vain. It is hoped that the soldiers of the country will strengthen their study of the lessons of the Xuzhou Campaign and create more brilliant battle achievements. The people of the country should cherish the value of the Xuzhou Campaign, mobilize to participate in the war as soon as possible, and support the bandit suppression war. The soldiers and civilians of the country should learn from the soldiers at the front and work hard to learn from them!

### The Soviet Union's Action to Split Berlin: The US, Britain, and France Will Not Sit Idly By; Reply to Neutral Countries' Mediation Plan; Declare All Rights Reserved in Berlin

[United Press, Paris, 1st dispatch] The three powers of Britain, the United States, and France declared to the Soviet Union and the world on the 1st that due to the Soviet Union's unilateral split of Berlin, the three countries reserve all rights to take any action to continue to stay in Berlin. The words of the three countries are tantamount to admitting that the Berlin issue is unsolvable. On the evening of the 30th, the three countries took advantage of the fact that the term of office of Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia as President of the Security Council had not yet expired and handed him a joint document stating the position of the three countries. This was at the time when Bramuglia advocated setting up a special technical committee to study Berlin's monetary and trade issues. The document of the three Western countries stated, "The three Western countries absolutely do not intend to submit to the Soviet Union's measures to strengthen the blockade of Berlin or interfere in municipal affairs and allow the Soviet Union to be unrestrained. Therefore, the governments of the three countries reiterate the statement of reserved rights when submitting this case to the Security Council as follows: "Will take all necessary steps to maintain the position of the three countries in Berlin under this circumstance." The three countries also pointed out that since October 25th, the Soviet Union has "constantly taken other actions to suppress the municipal government, resulting in the city's increasing division." The Western countries said that they welcome Bramuglia's delegation to "study" Berlin's monetary and trade issues, but also said that they will reserve their position when the study is completed and a resolution is submitted to the Security Council. The three countries said that they intend to "consider the resolution of the delegation based on the committee's report and the general situation at that time." The three countries reiterated their insistence on the Security Council resolution vetoed by the Soviet Union on October 25, but emphasized that any solution should recognize the Soviet Union's unilateral actions to divide Berlin. Due to this document and the verbal exchange with Western representatives, Bramuglia revised his proposal on the evening of the 30th. Bramuglia issued a document stating that the Berlin crisis is only a "simple small contact" in the world struggle and optimistically predicted that it can be resolved. "In order to resolve this matter, actions should not be reckless, and the factors of disagreement should not be overestimated, but everything should be regarded as an accidental event, full of confidence, to understand and sincerely solve this problem.

[United Press, Paris, 1st dispatch] A French official spokesman announced today that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky has submitted a reply to Bramuglia, accepting a compromise plan to mediate the Berlin dispute. Mr. Bu plans to start organizing a committee of experts to immediately find a way to draft a solution to the Berlin issue, and then submit a report to the Security Council within thirty days.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 1st dispatch] The Argentine Foreign Minister, who will end his term as President of the Security Council on December 1st, will take a train to Rome at 8:00 this morning.

### The Japanese Diet Passes the Anti-Strike Bill: MacArthur Praises It Highly and Defends Against British and Soviet Criticism

[United Press, Tokyo, 1st dispatch] MacArthur praised the Japanese Diet on the 1st for passing the bill he authorized to prohibit strikes by public officials, which is "a major victory for those who are committed to the integrity of representative government over the victims who are detached from the government and subdued by a minority." In the document, MacArthur defended his labor policy restrictions, denounced the criticisms of Soviet representatives, British Commonwealth spokesmen, and American labor groups, and declared that his efforts to establish a responsible civil service system were in accordance with the ideals of the late President Roosevelt. In a 600-word document, MacArthur stated that his plan has been misunderstood by people here and abroad as depriving the basic workers' rights in the trade union movement. He pointed out that this restriction does not apply to workers in private enterprises. He said: "The new law is a great victory for the broad and enlightened political style to conquer selfish political conspiracies. Furthermore, this is a decisive step forward for the Japanese people in seeking stable and responsible government." Regarding the limited right to collective bargaining for workers in Japanese state-run industries and companies, MacArthur stated that the freedom granted to government employees in Japan's new political system is more than that enjoyed by Americans. He said: "Due to this new law, public affairs will immediately present a new character and will become a tool for the government to protect public safety and individuals against the pressure of an indulgent minority."

[United Press, Paris, 30th dispatch] Soviet Chief Representative Vyshinsky hinted on the 30th that if the use of the veto power in the Security Council is subject to any restrictions, the Soviet Union will withdraw from the United Nations. Vyshinsky told the UN Political Committee that abolishing the veto power is tantamount to ending the United Nations on a daily basis. He said that the veto power was advocated and established by the late American President Roosevelt, who proposed this idea more than six months before the veto power was included in the UN Charter. He also said, "Without the veto power, the United Nations cannot survive for a day." The committee's representatives explained this point, that is, if the Soviet Union's use of the veto power is subject to any restrictions, the Soviet Union will completely withdraw from the United Nations.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th dispatch] Vyshinsky spoke at the Political Committee, refuting the British representative's accusations of the Soviet Union's abuse of the veto power, and rejecting the joint proposal of China, France, Britain, and the United States to prohibit the use of the veto power when discussing certain special events.

### The Fourth Japanese Diet Opens and Will Discuss Additional Budget

Yoshida Re-Advocates Arresting Ashida

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 1st dispatch] In accordance with the Constitution and the resolutions of the previous Diet, the Japanese government ordered the convocation of the fourth ordinary Diet today. However, this ordinary Diet will continue the struggle situation of the previous Diet. The crisis of dissolution has not only not passed, but will definitely be realized. Political observers generally speculate that the Diet will definitely be dissolved after the additional budget案 is passed, at the latest on the 15th of this month.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 1st dispatch] In accordance with Article 50 of the Japanese Constitution, members of both houses shall not be arrested during the Diet session, except as provided by law. If an arrest is made before the opening of the session, it shall also be released at the opening of the session. When the previous request to arrest former Prime Minister Shida and other three Diet members, the House of Representatives' Diet Steering Committee based on this article to study whether to allow the arrest, but no result was obtained, the session ended. The new fourth ordinary Diet was convened today, but the formal opening still has to wait until tomorrow. Therefore, Prime Minister Yoshida took advantage of this day's gap to once again request House Speaker Matsuoka to allow the arrest of Ashida and others. In Yoshida's opinion, even if the House of Representatives requests the release after the formal opening tomorrow, the arrest has already been made. Therefore, this kind of request for arrest is purely a political means. How Speaker Matsuoka will respond is currently unknown.

Can the United Nations shoulder this heavy burden?

### Tea Party Welcomes Tang Enbo and Chen Daqing; New and Old Garrison Commanders Hold Turnover Ceremony; Tang Expresses Four Opinions on the Current Situation

[Reported by This Newspaper] Mayor Wu held a tea party in the city government conference room yesterday afternoon at 5:00 p.m. to welcome Tang Enbo, Commander-in-Chief of the Beijing-Shanghai Garrison, and Chen Daqing, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, to their new posts. Over dozens of figures from various sectors attended including Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Zha Liangjian, Liu Hongsheng, Mei Lanfang, Yu Shuping, Zhang Xiaosong, Yan Huiqing, Zhao Zengjue, Tian Yong, Shen Zonglian, Shui Xiangyun, Lu Jingshi, Zhou Xuexiang, Yu Bingjian, Min Xiangfan, Xiang Changquan, Tao Baichuan, Tao Yishan, Cheng Cangbo, and Feng Youzhen. Mayor Wu first introduced Commander-in-Chief Tang and Commander Chen to the attendees, followed by Commander-in-Chief Tang's address, which included the following four points: (1) Public sentiment in Beijing and Shanghai is currently extremely volatile, and there is widespread pessimism about the war situation. In fact, the Chinese problem is a world problem, and a solution must be sought by analyzing and examining the entire world problem. Therefore, today's crisis is by no means a purely Chinese problem, and its success or failure must be judged in the overall reckoning of the world. (2) It has been three years since the victory of the War of Resistance. While the government certainly has shortcomings in politics, economy, and military affairs, the current difficult situation is due to the damage to vitality caused by the eight-year War of Resistance. Just when the people were yearning for stability after the victory of the War of Resistance, the communist bandits rose up and caused chaos, making it impossible to advance construction work. Therefore, the current shortcomings are purely caused by the environment. If there had been no communist bandits fighting after the victory of the War of Resistance, the situation would definitely not have reached this point. Therefore, to build the country, we must first quell the rebellion. (3) How to unleash strength, concentrate will, and complete the task. Shanghai is the largest city in the country, with abundant human and material resources. If we can pool our wisdom and efforts and fully unleash Shanghai's strength, not only can Shanghai be kept safe and peaceful, but the entire country can also be kept safe and peaceful. (4) I have heard recently that those with financial resources in Shanghai are fleeing in droves, and factories are also moving south. While there are many reasons for this phenomenon, I hope that it can be studied and stopped, because if financial resources and productive enterprises escape, it will definitely not be a blessing for Shanghai, let alone for the country. I hope that the municipal authorities will find ways to stabilize public sentiment and continue production.

Hope Citizens Do Not Believe Rumors

Commander Chen then gave a brief speech, stating: I am a soldier, and I have been appointed to Shanghai to obey the orders of the Central Government. I am not familiar with the situation in Shanghai and have no opinions to contribute to all of you. I only know that the responsibility of the Garrison Headquarters is to maintain law and order and ensure the safety of Shanghai. My colleagues and I must take responsibility and work hard with all our strength. However, psychological construction and spiritual armament are also important. I hope that the people of Shanghai will not listen to rumors and act rashly. In order to ensure law and order, the Garrison Headquarters will not only severely punish bandits but also correct all illegal actions that disrupt law and order. During the August 13th Incident, Shanghai had a glorious history. For example, the Four Lines Warehouse Defense inspired people at the time. I hope we can continue to use this spirit to defend Shanghai. Finally, I am willing to serve Shanghai to the best of my ability under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Tang and with the assistance of all sectors.

Committee Chairman Fang of the Kuomintang then reported on his visit to Xuzhou to comfort the troops. Commander Chen reported on the situation after Jinan fell into communist hands. Finally, Cheng Cangbo suggested that the authorities must quickly find ways to stabilize public sentiment in order to save the overall situation. The tea party adjourned at 6:30 p.m.

### Wounded Soldiers Transported to Shanghai for Medical Treatment Face Two Major Problems: Insufficient Medical Staff and Inadequate Non-Staple Food Expenses

[Reported by This Newspaper] Since the start of the Xuzhou campaign, wounded soldiers from the front line have been transported daily by air to the rear for treatment. There are currently nine rear hospitals on the Nanjing-Shanghai line from Zhenjiang to Shanghai receiving wounded soldiers. In this city, the Ministry of National Defense, the Supply Bureau, and the Municipal Committee for the Reception of Soldiers for Suppression and Comfort send staff to the airport to handle reception, tea, and wound care. The wounded soldiers who arrive are sent to the three rear hospitals in this city for treatment. The current capacity of the three hospitals can continue to accommodate about 500 more people, but due to the lack of medical staff, especially too few doctors to treat serious injuries and perform surgery, the relevant municipal health authorities are urgently needed to assist and mobilize surgical team members to participate in order to solve the above difficulties. According to the Supply Bureau, the authorities stipulate that each wounded soldier's monthly non-staple food expense is 300 yuan, which is considered insufficient according to the city's prices, and it has a great impact on the nutrition of the wounded soldiers. In addition, purchasing outside often leads to disputes, affecting discipline and attracting criticism. In order to improve this situation, it is urgently hoped that the municipal government will work with all parties to organize supply stations to plan and purchase on their behalf, so that the wounded soldiers can purchase reasonably priced vegetables at the prescribed cost.

Boarding students at the private Fudan Middle School on Huashan Road and Linsen Road went on a collective hunger strike last night to protest the unreasonable demands of the kitchen contractor. The school's student meals have always been contracted out to outsiders. At the beginning of this semester, each student paid enough food expenses equivalent to two dan of rice at once. Unexpectedly, the kitchen has recently requested a price increase on the pretext of rising prices, which was rejected by the school authorities and students. The kitchen then gradually reduced the amount of food, which the students could still tolerate. Unexpectedly, starting yesterday, the five dishes per meal were suddenly changed to one dish. The students felt that the food expenses had been paid in advance, and the food was so poor that they could not swallow it, so they started a hunger strike last night to show their protest. The school authorities are currently mediating.

### Besieged Xuzhou: Two Sides, Light and Dark

Continued from Page 1

Recovery Status: Starting from the 25th of last month, everything in Xuzhou gradually returned to normal. The sun shone, the cold gradually subsided, and most of the shops opened for business. The vegetable market stalls were crowded with people, and the streets were bustling, which slightly diluted the wartime atmosphere. However, things were very different in the evening. The martial law officer started at 6:00 p.m., and there were no pedestrians on the road. At the same time, since Xuzhou's electricity was supplied by the Jiawang Power Plant, before Jiawang was recovered, Xuzhou was still a dark world at night, except for the Suppression Headquarters' own power generation. The streets were heavily guarded, and everything made people from the rear cities feel that the lifestyle in Jiangnan could not withstand the harsh test of this era.

Because Xuzhou is a besieged city, the supply of materials is difficult, so prices are higher than in the rear. On the eve of the reporter's departure from Xuzhou, the price of white rice was about 500 yuan per dan, flour 200 yuan per bag, vegetables 4 yuan per catty, pork 14 yuan per catty, eggs 3 yuan each, and local Dangshan pears were also sold for 16 yuan per catty. Industrial products, because they come from distant cities, are even more expensive. A pack of Baisi brand cigarettes sells for 20 yuan, matches are 60-70 cents per box, and a second-class bar of soap costs 4 yuan. The Shanghai Comfort Group and the reporter group also contributed a little to suppressing prices in Xuzhou, because they brought a lot of newspapers, confirming that Shanghai and other places were exchanging gold and silver yuan without restrictions. Everyone's confidence in the gold yuan rose sharply, and prices generally fell by 30%. According to the survey, the price of gold and silver in Xuzhou is far higher than in Beijing and Shanghai. For example, on the 20th of last month, the old price of gold in Xuzhou was as high as 6,000 yuan per tael, but the black market price in Shanghai was only 1,800 yuan, a difference of more than three times. The highest price of silver dollars was 60 yuan, and once the news of Shanghai's exchange was confirmed, it once fell to 35 yuan, but within a day or two, it rose back to more than 40 yuan. Chinese people have a commercial mind, and there are special people doing this good business!

As of the end of last month, in addition to the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, which have resumed business, other commercial banks in Xuzhou were still in a state of rest. There are 18 banks in the party, and 6 credit cooperatives. According to people who know the inside story, all commercial banks have backstage support, and they have official funds to lend at high interest rates on the black market. The deposits nominally pay 5% interest, but in fact they have to pay 15%. After the banks take in these funds, they have to lend them to merchants at an interest rate of at least 30%, and merchants have to raise the price of goods by at least 5% per month in order not to lose money. Thus, interest rates and prices chase each other. The impact is that official funds are used to generate interest, and the lives of soldiers are greatly affected. Secondly, the local prices of local products affect the general people's livelihood. If they do not return to regroup, the lives of ordinary people may be more comfortable.

Besieged City Fate: After the victory on the eastern front, the heads of various agencies in Xuzhou held a joint meeting to discuss how to restore the local situation to normal. As a result, several measures were decided, such as asking the airline to resume flights to Xuzhou to stabilize public sentiment; asking local national banks to resume business and allow remittances of less than 1,000 yuan to stabilize the lives of family members of staff working in Xuzhou. At the same time, theaters were ordered to resume business so that the general public could have entertainment in their spare time, and the wartime tension could be unconsciously eliminated, which could also indirectly stabilize public sentiment. These measures were quite effective at the time, but now they have become bygones. Because after the battle shifted to the south, Xuzhou became an isolated city behind the lines, and its future fate is difficult to predict, because the military itself is the most unpredictable. According to an analysis by a senior military officer, to ensure the safety of Xuzhou, it is necessary to advance to Yanzhou in the north and recapture Kaifeng in the west, and the National Army does have this plan. Of course, whether this plan can be realized depends entirely on the Bengbu-Suzhou battle. It is remembered that two years ago, when the overall suppression campaign was launched, the National Army used Xuzhou as its base and concentrated nearly one million troops to go north to Shandong and directly attack Jinan; two years later, Xuzhou has become an isolated city. Reviewing the state affairs of the past two years on the ancient battlefield of Xuzhou makes people feel a lot. However, at the same time, seeing the masses of Xuzhou are able to overcome the difficulties with a smile, as if they have completely forgotten the dangers that have just passed, it is felt that the vitality of the general people of China is particularly strong, and they can cope with any adversity. Although the country is currently in a state of darkness, there is still a way out.

### China Textile Company in a State of Anarchy; Shu Yunzhang, Yun Zhijian, and Wu Weijing Still in Hangzhou

[Reported by This Newspaper] Shu Yunzhang, general manager of the China Textile Construction Company, has repeatedly submitted his resignation to the company's board of directors and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce because the company's business is facing various difficulties that cannot be resolved, in order to avoid delaying state-owned enterprises. Finally, after being retained, he served until the end of last month, while waiting for a replacement. Now that the term has expired, Shu submitted his resignation again a few days ago, and Shu has not gone to the company since yesterday to show his firm determination to leave. In addition, Deputy General Manager Wu Weijing is also staying in Hangzhou and has not returned, and the company seems to be in a state of anarchy, waiting for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to make a final decision.

### Passengers Going to Hong Kong and Taiwan Mostly Middle Class; China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Maintains Order and Dispatches Additional Armed Escort Team

The ships of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sailing to Hong Kong and Taiwan are unprecedentedly crowded, with each ship exceeding its carrying capacity. Moreover, there are those who board without tickets, and the order is extremely chaotic. In order to maintain order on board, the Bureau has, from today onwards, dispatched additional armed escort teams and reduced the number of passengers as much as possible to avoid exceeding the carrying capacity and causing danger. It is reported that the identities of passengers on various ships have gradually declined in recent days. Most of the prominent officials and wealthy people have already left. Those who are now taking ships to Hong Kong and Taiwan are mostly middle-class people.

Moreover, in recent days, most of the passengers going to Hong Kong and Taiwan have carried a large number of boxes and luggage, so that the decks of the ships are full of luggage, causing congestion on the way. Now, in order to limit the weight of luggage carried by passengers, the shipping companies have stipulated that the total weight shall not exceed 40 cubic feet. This restriction is rarely seen in previous years.

### Xie Youmin and Xie Yaoquan Indicted for Embezzlement

Xie Youmin, standing committee member of the Shanghai County Party Department and chairman of the board of directors of the Zigang Township Cooperative of Shanghai County, and Xie Yaoquan, manager, borrowed 430 catties of bean cakes from the Shanghai Branch of the China Farmers Bank in June of this year, priced at 1.48 million yuan per catty, and distributed them to farmers and members of the cooperative. It was stipulated that the money could only be collected at the end of November, but the two Xies collected the money in advance at a price of 2.5 million yuan per catty. Later, the Agricultural Bank discovered this and reported it to the Shanghai County Government, which sent it to the local procuratorate of this city for investigation on charges of embezzlement. It is now known that the prosecutor has concluded the investigation and trial of the case and believes that the evidence of the two defendants' crimes is indeed conclusive. Therefore, yesterday, they were formally prosecuted on charges of embezzlement.

### High Cost of Living Causes Panic in the Industrial Sector; Request to Government to Open Industrial Loans

[Our newspaper dispatch] After the announcement of the lower-period cost of living index for this month, the industrial sector was greatly panicked. Some factories found it very difficult to maintain the status quo at a time when production and sales were sluggish and usury was intensifying. Now that the cost of living index has increased to 15.4 times, and wage expenditures have increased by nearly one time, they really cannot bear the burden. In recent days, they have successively expressed their grievances to the Municipal Industry Association, requesting the government to immediately open up industrial loans to alleviate the urgent needs and enable the circulation of funds. The person in charge of the Municipal Industry Association is now considering making another earnest appeal to the authorities, hoping to provide effective relief in the short term.

### Subsidized Rice Distribution for Workers, Teachers, and Journalists; Implementation Five Days After Approval at Food Conference

The Civil Food Allocation Committee, in response to requests from all parties, will launch subsidized rice distribution. The target groups for distribution are workers, school faculty and staff (originally only private schools were handled, but this time, city school faculty and staff are also included in the distribution), news reporters and their dependents. The Civil Food Allocation Committee will issue special subsidized distribution certificates separately, which are completely unrelated to the allocation markings attached to national identification cards. The price of the subsidized rice will also be cheaper than the price of rice for registered households. In recent days, the authorities have repeatedly consulted with the Shanghai Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration on handling the subsidized distribution method and technical issues related to the rice shops undertaking the distribution. The matter will be brought up for discussion at the food conference to be held in the municipal government today. If it can be successfully approved, it can be implemented starting from the 5th of this month, simultaneously with the household rice distribution in November. In addition, after the subsidized distribution is implemented, the special rice distribution certificates originally issued to workers, teachers, journalists, etc., will be discontinued.

It is also learned that the special rice distribution will be directly allocated by the Civil Food Allocation Committee. Please ask each beneficiary unit to collect the per capita distribution certificates, together with the rice money, and send them to the office on Lafayette Road to receive the allocation vouchers, which can then be used to collect rice at the designated warehouse. The Civil Food Allocation Committee solemnly stated that all those who enjoy special rice sales must not use the per capita distribution certificates casually. As for the monthly application procedures, they should still be handled before the 15th of each month as originally stipulated.

November Household Rice Price to be Discussed and Decided Today

According to information from the Civil Food Allocation Committee, the selling price of rice for household distribution in this city in November will be discussed at this meeting, as it is necessary to discuss the subsidized rice distribution for industrial and occupational workers, public school personnel, and their dependents, and full preparation is required in advance. Therefore, it has been decided to change the meeting to this afternoon (the 2nd), still at the municipal government, convened by Mayor Wu, who is also the chairman of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, and attended by relevant agencies such as the American Aid Utilization Committee of the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Food, the China Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, the Emergency Grain Purchase and Storage Committee, and the Civil Food Allocation Office, to discuss and decide the price, which can be announced in various newspapers on the 3rd. Also, the Civil Food Allocation Committee has fully prepared all the rice for household distribution in November and is only waiting for the allocation price to be approved, which may begin to be sold from the 5th.

### Enemy and Puppet Property Auction Shelved Due to Overly High Valuations and Tight Credit

According to news from the Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office, the auction of commercial enemy and puppet real estate that has been confiscated and finalized has now been announced to be shelved again. The reasons are: (1) Credit is extremely tight recently, and it is not easy to collect funds. Without a lump sum of funds, it is impossible to bid successfully. (2) All parties believe that the re-valuation by the office is too high and they are unable to purchase. Currently, the office has no one to accept the auction of enemy and puppet real estate, so it can only temporarily suspend the process, create registers separately, and submit them to the Executive Yuan for a decision on how to handle them.

### Fans Gather Beside Daji Road; After a Long Absence, Donghua Loses to Dongxing by Two Goals; Exhibition Match Results in 3-1

[Our newspaper dispatch] The Donghua and Dongxing football teams played a commemorative football exhibition match at the Nanshi Stadium yesterday to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Guoguang Society. Donghua has been out of the spotlight for a long time, and this year is its first formal public appearance. Fans crowded beside Daji Road, filling all four stands with 5,000 spectators, setting an unprecedented record for the Nanshi Stadium. Because Donghua had been away from the field for a long time, its skills were somewhat rusty. Although there were many shooting opportunities, its attack was fierce in the first half, but its luck was not good, and it only scored one goal. Dongxing went all out, with Zhang Jiliang, Jiang Kun, and Chen Qin on the front line, cooperating very well. The defense was strengthened by the famous general Wu Qixiang, making Donghua's left wing lose its activity. The first half ended 1-1. In the second half, Dongxing won two goals in a row, defeating Donghua 3-1, which can be called rare.

The Process Was Quite Exciting

The match was quite exciting, especially the first half, where the strengths were evenly matched, with each side having wonderful goals and scoring one goal each, but the shooting was extremely exciting, and the fans in the four stands cheered incessantly. Dongxing focused on defense rather than offense, so it was able to maintain its defense under Donghua's encircling attack in the first half. Wu Qixiang, Wang Baoshan, and Yan Chengkuan should all be credited. Donghua had been away from the field for a long time and failed to play to its full potential. Chen Mingzhe on the right wing showed considerable progress in his sprints, passes, attacks, and shots. Han Longhai and Li Yao repeatedly attacked, but failed, which was a pity. Zhang Lingen defended the goal and made many saves.

Each Scored Once and No Winner Was Determined

The match started at 3:30 pm, with referee Chen Fubao and linesmen Zang Wenbin and Wang Lin. As soon as the two sides made contact, Donghua's offensive was very strong. After ten minutes, Longhai's angled shot was fierce, and Yan Chengkuan jumped up, but failed to catch it. But heaven blessed Dongxing, and it hit the crossbar and bounced out. Zheng Bingyi hooked it away. After 20 minutes, Dongxing attacked, and Zhang Jiliang broke through in the middle, kicking the door open. Zhang Lingen rushed to rescue it and turned the tide. At this time, Dongxing's offensive surged like a tide. After 23 minutes, Zhang Jiliang suddenly shot from 20 yards from the difficult gate. Zhang Banglun was too late to save it and the ball went through the net. Dongxing won a goal, 1-0. After Donghua's defeat, it was unwilling to give up. Jia Youliang waved his army to attack. Chen Mingzhe went straight down the side. Longhai's header missed. Dongxing's defense blocked it, and it still fell to Longhai's feet, who recognized the door and shot fiercely, sending the ball into the net. Donghua leveled the score within three minutes. After that, both sides still had offensives, but neither made any achievements, and the first half ended with a score of 1-1.

Donghua Drank Hatred on the Field

After the break, the two sides changed positions and fought again. Donghua's lineup remained unchanged. Dongxing changed its troops, Yao Qingsheng was replaced by Xia Shufu, and Wang Burong was replaced by Zhang Jingen. The two teams circled again, and Donghua still took a fierce offensive. After four minutes, Qian Changrong passed beautifully to Li Yao, who cut in and shot, but unexpectedly hit Yan Chengkuan's body. After ten minutes, Qian Yunqing also came to knock on the door, flying into the sky. Jia Youliang's shot also missed. Donghua's repeated attacks were unsuccessful. Dongxing worked hard to attack. After 19 minutes, Wang Burong forced a corner kick, and Jiang Kun rushed and was firmly rejected, entering the net nest together. The ball was also brought in. Dongxing won another goal, 2-1. Donghua's bad luck was not over yet. Three minutes later, Wang Burong rushed in again and crossed. Chen Qin pushed the boat along the water in front of the door, 3-1. After that, Donghua tried its best to counterattack, and the bullets rained down in front of the Dongxing goal, but Yan Chengkuan was as if aided by God, saving each one. In the twilight, Donghua drank hatred and ended the game.

The organizers expressed their deep gratitude to the Nanshi Stadium, the Donghua and Dongxing football teams, and the small football referees for their assistance.

### Two Changes in Basketball Rules

The latest American basketball rules, 1949-50, have two changes, which are translated remotely by the famous basketball referee Liu Hesheng as follows:

(1) When a substitute enters the game, he only needs to report to the recorder. After the referee or inspector directs him to enter the game, he can directly substitute the player, and he does not need to report to the referee or the inspector. (2) When there is a jump ball, it must be held in the nearest circle with a radius of six and a half feet (i.e., the center circle and the two free throw areas).

### St. John's Men's and Women's Teams Win; University Basketball League Loses to Great China University Yesterday

[Our newspaper dispatch] The St. John's men's and women's teams, which won the university basketball championship, defeated Great China University twice in the third university basketball league yesterday. The score for the women's team was 45 to 15, and for the men's team it was 66 to 32. There were 500 students from both schools at the stadium.

The match was held in the St. John's University Friendship Room. The women's match started at 3:00 pm. St. John's Zhang Luoluo scored first, and Wu Hanlian followed with three consecutive goals. Zhang Luoluo scored two more goals. St. John's defense, Zhou Zhifen, Li Sen, and Zheng Jingyuan were heavily guarded, and Great China University could not break the duck egg. In the first quarter, 14-0, St. John's won by a clean sweep. In the second quarter, St. John's made a big change in personnel. Although the offensive momentum of the forwards was still strong, the defense gradually became lax. Great China's Zhai Wu scored a total of nine points with continuous shots and free throws. St. John's captain Lin Jing scored two shots and two free throws, and Wu Hanyun added three more. In the first half, 28-4, St. John's took the lead. In the third and fourth quarters, St. John's was undiminished, Zhang Luoluo scored five consecutive goals, Lin and Wu also scored. Great China University suffered a setback, allowing Xiao Jixia and Zhang Li to score one goal each, and the game ended 45-15, St. John's won by a clean 30 points.

The men's competition was on stage, with Yu Yi and Wang Weigong officiating. St. John's Sun Moses broke the basket first, and Zhuang Yirong and Wu Xinyun showed their power one after another, and in an instant took a 9-0 lead. Great China's time-out was ineffective. Sun Moses and Huang Tianlie reported that they had hit the target again. Great China University launched a full-scale counterattack, and Yu Zufufu and Yang Hongjun both scored, but the situation was still controlled by St. John's. Great China University only relied on long-range shots to score, and in the first half St. John's had 33 points and Great China University had 14. In the second half, St. John's used as many new generals as possible, and Great China University showed a slight improvement. Sun Hanxi scored six points, and the battle gradually became tense, but not long after, St. John's showed its power again. Wang Gongsen repeatedly received Sun Lixi's wonderful passes and frequently scored. Great China University called a time-out, but St. John's was still unstoppable. Wei Shangpu made three of three shots, Qian Shijun made two wonderful shots, and Hu Siqing tucked in under the basket. The silver whistle blew, and St. John's won a big victory with 66 to 32.

Regarding the deadline for accepting Legal Tender, Customs Gold Units, and Northeast Notes, which was originally scheduled to end on November 20, it has been learned that the Ministry of Finance has approved an extension due to the numerous requests from military and political authorities, people's organizations, banking associations, chambers of commerce, and organizations in various provinces and cities.

### More Locations Set up for Exchange of Gold and Silver

The situation for exchanging gold and silver yesterday was still as crowded as before. The Central Bank's decision the day before to add more exchange locations to the branches of the existing undertaking banks was not officially opened yesterday because the various banks were unable to allocate staff in time. It is learned that these newly added exchange locations can be officially opened today, but some branches may only exchange silver coins due to insufficient staff. It is expected that the total number of these newly added exchange locations will be around ten.

[Another dispatch] The Central Bank has stipulated that the amount of gold and silver that its employees can exchange for their deposits is limited to the total amount of their salary, allowances, and bonuses for this month. It is heard that the bank's regulations are mainly to prevent its employees from taking advantage of their positions and exchanging for others out of favoritism, thus losing the principle of fairness and reason.

### Credit Still Tight

In recent days, credit in the market has still been trending toward tightness. Yesterday was the first day after the November period. The shortage of cash funds was due to the withdrawal of gold and silver and the large amount of funds carried by some people leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong, which increased the demand from all parties. The actual funds were insufficient. The cash premium was as high as 15%. In addition, the interbank credit was also tight the day before, and the amount withdrawn from the Central Bank was not much. Customers were only allowed to withdraw 500 yuan in cash, and all the rest were paid with cashier's checks. The daily rate was also higher than before, between 65 and 80 yuan.

### 72 Import Applications for Foreign Orders Paid for Approved

### Statistics on Deposits and Reserves of Shanghai Banks in October

[Our newspaper dispatch] According to the comparative table of deposits and reserves of Shanghai banks in October of this year, published by the Audit Office of the Central Bank, the amount of current deposits was 130,273,220.7 yuan, the amount of fixed deposits was 17,458,496.68 yuan, the total amount of deposits was 147,731,627.05 yuan, and the paid reserve was 26,524,209.00 yuan.

### Yarn Factories Request an Increase in the Labor Cost Ratio

The original ratio for the second distribution of American aid cotton and yarn was set at 583 pounds of cotton per 20-count yarn, but according to the situation in the first half of November, the increase in labor costs was much greater than the increase in yarn prices. Therefore, whether the cotton was spun into yarn or there was excess cotton left after spinning, it was not enough to cover the cost when offsetting labor costs. According to the investigation, the total amount of wages and other temporary increased burdens in the first half of November exceeded the "819" labor cost by 23 times, while cotton only rose by more than ten times. Now, the factories hope that the ratio should be increased in the third phase of distribution to avoid excessive losses for the factories.

### Cotton Cloth Market to Resume on the 6th, Decided Yesterday by the Cloth Industry Association

The Cotton Cloth Market has recently been decided by the board of directors and supervisors that if the official document for the resumption of business is not received from the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs this week, it will decide to resume automatically on the 6th of this month. The secretary of the association is currently drafting a presentation, which can be submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs tomorrow, explaining this situation. In addition, the chairman of the association, Dong Jiufeng, resolutely resigned and representatives are being sent to persuade him to stay.

### Sugar Market Weakness

Yesterday's sugar market trend remained sluggish. The capital situation of the industry's banks has not yet eased significantly. Local merchants' buying interest was weak, and retail investors were eager to sell, causing the market to decline further.

No. 4 and 5 refined white sugar opened in the morning at 390 yuan and 385 yuan. With ample supply of inventory in the market and weakening sentiment, prices fell all the way to 365 yuan at the close due to oversupply. Medium and coarse granulated sugar each fell by about 30 yuan, while native brown sugar and other types each fell by 10%.

### Rice Market: Weak in the South, Firm in the North; Flour Slightly Rises, Edible Oil Continues to Fall

Yesterday, the rice market was weak in the south and firm in the north. In the southern market, the opening price in the morning briefly saw a bid increase of ten yuan, but due to continued tight credit and abundant arrivals, rice shops' buying interest remained sluggish, and the market trend remained weak, eventually resulting in a decline. Due to its high price, white japonica rice fell back to 360 yuan yesterday, thin indica rice fell by ten yuan, and early rice was reduced by five yuan. In the northern market, prices had fallen too much in the past two days and were lower than in the southern market, so rice shops did not buy, leading to a rebound. White japonica rice was 370 yuan, an increase of 15 yuan. Thin indica rice rose by 30 yuan, and early rice and "Yangdu Xian" rice all rose by 30 yuan. The total arrivals in the north and south markets yesterday were 8,447 shi.

Flour saw a slight rebound because the previous day's sharp decline was excessive. Purchasers saw the low prices and reduced sales, and actual sales saw buying at the bottom, and the market became active again, leading to a rebound. Old brand flour rose to 118 yuan, and "Warship" brand flour rose to a high of 116 yuan, closing at 110 yuan, an increase of four to six yuan from the previous day. Miscellaneous brand flour all rebounded by five or six yuan, and bran also rebounded, with large bags of bran at 7,000 yuan.

The decline in miscellaneous grains intensified, as tight credit continued and most merchants did not buy. Soybean prices fell sharply by 25 yuan due to the decline in oil prices. Qingdao merchants did not buy corn, leading to a significant decline. Chongming corn was 140 yuan, a decrease of about 30 yuan. Tea beans and selected green beans each fell by 10 yuan. Red sorghum was selling poorly, falling rapidly by 20 yuan, sesame seeds fell by 30 yuan, and raw peanuts plummeted by 60 to 70 yuan.

The decline in edible oil continued. Credit remained tight, and factories frequently offered sales, but local merchants' buying interest remained low. Soybean oil fell from 630 yuan to 600 yuan, a decrease of 50 yuan. Vegetable oil fell below 500 yuan, a decrease of 30 to 40 yuan. Raw oil opened at 720 yuan, and small cart sesame oil fell sharply by 80 yuan. Soybean cake fell by five yuan.

### Cotton Yarn Lingers at Low Levels; Cloth Continues to Decline

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market continued to tighten credit. Merchants rarely made purchases. Bulls continued to sell actively. Trading in warehouse receipts lacked interest. Although there were rumors of increased tariff benefits, sentiment remained sluggish. The market selling pressure was strong. New purchases were cautious. Bears were active, and bulls were unable to push up prices, so they had to lower prices to sell.

42-count "Blue Phoenix" fine yarn initially bid down to 1,700 yuan, lingering at low levels for quite some time. By the afternoon close, short covering caused the bid price to rise slightly to 10,600 yuan, a further decrease of 100 yuan from the previous day. 21-count "Double Horse" yarn also initially bid down to 800 yuan. There were many offers after the opening. At one point, it fell to a low of 6,500 to 6,600 yuan. Due to bargain hunting, retail investors pulled up the price, raising it to 7,500 yuan at the close, a decrease of 300 yuan from the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell by 200 to 300 yuan to 1,100 to 1,200 yuan.

The cotton cloth market saw more offers than bids at the opening in the morning, and bid prices continued to decline. Those with goods were idle and nervous, selling off in succession. It was only heard that northern merchants had some profit taking and short covering. Merchants in Changsha and local merchants also had some buying interest at low prices. Big firms and factories continued to sell, and prices fell all the way down.

12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth initially bid down to 15 yuan. The final bid price was slightly higher, with transactions around 375 yuan.

"Four Gentlemen" broadcloth had the same price, a further decrease of five yuan from the previous day. 190 high-end "Shilin" cloth was transacted at 750 yuan. "White Cat" printed cloth was transacted at 320 yuan. The market for other cloths was also generally sluggish.

### Sales of Rayon Temporarily Suspended

The China Trust Bureau's rayon meeting decided that rayon sales would be temporarily suspended from November 25 to December 4. Customs procedures are currently being processed, and rayon sales will be postponed until next week.

Market Price Summary

### Jiangxi People Don Military Uniforms to Support Military Supplies and Civilian Food

— Our Reporter Liu Zao

[Our Nanchang 28th Quick Report] Although the people of Jiangxi, in this time of widespread conflict, have not directly smelled the gunpowder, they have long put on military uniforms, preparing for the arrival of war. The call by Mr. Xiong Shihui in his hometown to "contribute grain if you have grain, contribute soldiers if you have soldiers" has further deepened Jiangxi's wartime atmosphere today.

"Jiangxi Grain" has now become an important military supply supporting the front lines in suppressing the rebellion. The source areas even have to supply civilian food to neighboring provinces and even North China. The provincial government authorities have made grain requisitioning a major part of Jiangxi's governance today. Not only has the Field Tax Administration Office taken on the entire "requisition and procurement" task, but the heads of other departments and the Provincial Committee are also constantly sitting in outer counties urging the requisition.

However, Jiangxi's burden of supplying grain to the central government this year has increased considerably. Jiangxi's field tax quota this year is 3 dou for actual collection, 2 dou 2.5 sheng for requisition, 1 dou 5 for public grain, 1 sheng for preferential grain, and 9 sheng for autonomous donation grain, each yuan equivalent to 7 dou 7.5 sheng. Except for the requisition, which is entirely for the central government, 50% of the actual collection remains in the county, 30% belongs to the central government, and 30% belongs to the province. The public grain portion is half provincial and half county. Currently, except for counties with inconvenient transportation such as Xiushui Tongpeng in the Mufu Mountain area and Dingnan in the Meiling Mountain area, which are converted to national currency, other counties have already begun the requisition. The total amount of actual collection and requisition in the province, according to the central government's regulations, is: 2.7 million shi for actual collection, 2.03 million yuan for requisition, and 30% of the total amount of requisition and actual collection for public grain, totaling 1.42 million shi. In addition, there are autonomous donation grain, preferential grain, and school grain donations from various counties.

The central government's purchase of military grain in Jiangxi has further increased the burden on the people. Although military grain is purchased at a prepared price, in order to complete the task quickly, the purchasing agencies do not allow buying one or two zu at a time according to the market price. Therefore, the Provincial Military Grain Procurement Office still distributes this year's quota of one million large bags according to

Grain-Producing Counties

to be handled by the county governments. Currently, the central government is urgently urging the Provincial Field Grain Office to purchase and transport military grain. Recently, the Central Grain Conference decided that this year, an additional 400,000 large bags would be added in Jiangxi, totaling 1.4 million large bags of rice, equivalent to 3.733 million shi. Excluding the original quota of one million large bags, equivalent to 2.667 million shi, it has been decided to purchase 400,000 shi of provincial-level public grain and 800,000 shi of county-level public grain, and purchase 1.467 million shi from the market. As for the newly allocated 400,000 large bags, it has also been decided to purchase another 100,000 shi of provincial grain. The Finance Department and the Military Grain Procurement Office will discuss with convenient counties and order the counties to allocate this year's tax grain evenly in six months from November this year to the end of June next year, and purchase 200,000 shi of county grain, also allocated evenly from November this year to June next year. The remaining 766,000 shi will be purchased in the market, and military grain procurement sub-offices will be set up in grain-producing counties to be responsible for handling the purchase.

Currently, the central government has strictly ordered the Provincial Field Grain Office to deliver 70% of the field tax and purchased military grain due this year by the end of November this year, and to fully deliver the full amount by the end of December.

Under the premise of military first during the suppression of the rebellion, the supply of military grain is the duty of every grain-producing citizen in the rear. At the same time, Jiangxi has been designated by the central government as a grain production increase county this year. Central personnel and resources have been concentrated in Jiangxi, designating more than ten counties such as Ji'an, Nanchang, and Linchuan as grain production increase areas. According to a person in charge of agricultural affairs: this year's

Grain Production Increase Work

was delayed due to the late arrival of funds and the slow progress of staff, which delayed the timing. In particular, the funds could not be allocated in one lump sum. After the farmers received them, they could not be used for a specific purpose, and the timing was lost. Therefore, wasteland could not be reclaimed, and land could not be cultivated, only alleviating part of the green seedling money and the exploitation of usury in rural areas.

Therefore, although Jiangxi's grain production received some subsidies from the central government this year, it did not produce real results and suffered from floods in various places, resulting in a sharp decrease in the harvest. If the early rice harvest is counted as 80%, it may still be less than last year's 75.718 million shi. If calculated at 80%, it is only 60.375045 million shi. Based on the province's

People's Consumption

last year's total consumption was 80.1288983 million shi. This year, the following estimates are 66.808649 million shi. (1) Civilian food: Last year, civilian food was calculated based on a population of 12.505808 people, with each person consuming 6 shi of rice per year, requiring approximately 75.134848 million shi. This year's population, according to the Civil Affairs Department's statistics in June 1948, is 12.455013 people. According to the Food Department's regulations, each person consumes 5 shi of rice per year, requiring 62.275 million shi. (2) Seed retention: Last year's seed retention was 306,584 shi. The same this year. (3) Outward military grain transportation: Last year it was 1.710551 million shi, this year's outward military grain transportation (30% of the central government's field tax collection, all requisitioned) is 1.6 million shi. (4) Military grain purchase: Last year's total military grain purchase was 3.167 million shi, this year the provincial government's order to purchase military grain is 2.667 million shi. Therefore, Jiangxi's grain production and sales, after deducting military grain, civilian food, and next year's seed total, are still short of 6.273604 million shi. Fortunately, the autumn harvest this year, such as late rice and miscellaneous grains, has been quite abundant. It is estimated that the total output of the province is 15.785669 million shi. Some of the civilian food in rural Jiangxi needs to be supplemented by miscellaneous grains.

### Communism in China (Part 2)

Prior to 1945, contact between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Moscow was severely hindered by transportation difficulties. However, the CCP consistently maintained close ties with communist parties around the world. Hundreds of CCP leaders traveled to Moscow, where most received advanced training. At the Seventh World Congress of the Communist International in 1935, three of the forty-seven elected executive committee members were Chinese communists. This committee was of great importance, so Stalin himself, along with Zhdanov, were also executive members. In addition, one of the twenty members of the International Control Commission was a Chinese communist. The presidium of the executive committee, consisting of nineteen members, also included a CCP representative. Stalin himself was also a member of the presidium. The CCP, like any other communist party in the world, was a branch of the global communist movement. This is documented in the history of the CCP and the Communist International, in terms of doctrine, policy, organization, personnel, and action. The latter half of this study will show that this record has not been broken by any changes. The strange thing is not: Are they truly communists? But: Why would well-informed and sincere people raise this question? The Communist Party has never raised this question.

In any country, ideology, prophecies, and commands must suit local conditions. The CCP behaves only as the CCP, not as the French Communist Party. However, what seems complex to some observers, the localized differences do not contradict the overall consistency.

B. China in the Eyes of the Communists

Lenin wrote an interesting short essay in 1913 discussing the importance of China and the possible development of the Asian revolutionary movement following the Soviet revolution, but in the years after the 1917 Soviet revolution, Lenin's comrades had no time to consider the China problem. The Russian Civil War, foreign intervention, and the hope of extending revolutionary power to Europe left them no time for other concerns. But when the situation in the West stabilized, they turned their attention to China. A revolution occurred in China in 1911, but it was clear that this revolution was not complete. Lenin seized the opportunity to transform a middle-class revolution in a backward country into a "proletarian dictatorship" in just one year. This achievement encouraged people to entertain all sorts of empty dreams about the possibility of similar revolutions in other backward countries or colonial regions. China seemed to be one of the Communist Party's initial opportunities.

The importance of China to world communism is not difficult to estimate. First, the Communist Party attached extraordinary importance to China. When world communism encountered an unprecedented internal crisis in 1927—the split between Stalin and Trotsky—China became a major issue. Second, China was the only country with a vast territory and strong communist forces. Therefore, the Communist Party did not need a national government. It only needed its own organized army to maintain long-term control over a vast area. Third, in relatively backward countries, the opportunities for communism are getting better day by day, while in advanced industrial countries, the opportunities are decreasing day by day. China is the only large country that is industrially backward and politically independent. For the Communist Party, it is precisely the experimental factory and proving ground for testing the development of communist theory, strategy, and tactics to all industrially backward countries around the world. These countries happen to account for three-quarters of the world's population. For the sake of thorough understanding, we must make a brief analysis of the characteristics of China.

C. An Analysis of China

China is a large country with great rivers and advanced agriculture, with hundreds of millions of farmers. China has many traditions, carefully preserved by scholars and artists of past generations. It is a country where the old is disintegrating and the new is crystallizing simultaneously. However, the China that concerns us at this moment is a country that is closely linked to the survival of world problems.

First, China is one of the three major centers of human culture and civilization, with a history of three thousand years. The other two centers are India and Europe. Before this century, the changes in Chinese culture were relatively slow. Second, China has a vast territory. China's higher cultural standards supported its strength, enabling it to maintain its vast territory. Even in times of national weakness, it was once conquered by foreign tribes, but it was eventually able to assimilate its conquerors. Third, China did not begin to apply technology and industrial power until the nineteenth century—about four hundred years later than the European Renaissance—with the scale of production and organization. That is to say, Western countries went through centuries to develop a political system adapted to change or progress, but China, in accepting the new industry of the West, had to accept the products that had been developed over centuries, without sufficient time to adapt to the political environment. Europe used sixteenth-century politics to cope with sixteenth-century progress, and eighteenth-century politics to cope with eighteenth-century progress. But China had to use fifteenth-century politics to cope with nineteenth-century progress.

The development of constitutional government, modern legislation, political parties, majority rule, and national unity in the West underwent a three-century evolution before the rise of democratic forces in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In China, these early tasks were not ready, and had to be carried out simultaneously with our later work.

At the same time, Chinese society remains at a stage where the influence of popular thought is stronger than in the West and the organization of government is weaker than in the West. This situation is precisely favorable to communism, whose painstaking and ambitious doctrine is prepared to be sold to anyone seeking new doctrines to replace the old.

The fourth important fact about China is that China has not been submerged by Western civilization. In the past four centuries, only a very few small countries have been able to remain independent politically and legally without European influence. China is the only large country capable of maintaining cultural independence. It cannot be conquered by any foreign tribe, nor can it be divided. No expatriates can establish themselves in China, multiply, and displace the natives, as the British did in the Americas.

In short, China is undergoing a transformation, which would have taken more than five times as long in Europe. A society accustomed to traditional government is now struggling to organize creative institutions. A society ignorant of early science is forced to swallow late science whole. The long-term experimental process that produced modern Western government is too slow to be directly copied or shortened. China must abandon the forces of tradition, even abandon its faith in tradition.

The above is all about China itself. But what applies to China must also apply to the Chinese people. The character of an individual is not entirely similar to the character of his country. People still love peace when their country is at war. Most Chinese farmers are illiterate. He knows that any dynasty must eventually fall. He knows from legends that historical heroes are not all good, nor are they all bad. He opposes anything that is annoying and malicious, and foreigners bear the brunt. Take, for example, the Chinese petty bourgeois, rickshaw puller, shopkeeper, or machine craftsman. He knows dozens or hundreds of characters. He attributes his profession, his status, and his stable life to his family, his guild, or his fellow villagers. He feels the oppression of inflation and price controls, and can cope with it with ease. He has no rational trust in the political future.

He is down-to-earth. National unity is just an abstract concept to him. He feels that China has not yet reached the level of Western countries. He believes that China is not yet suitable for free elections and majority rule. He does not understand that law can be based on legislative decisions. He can be incited by guerrilla riots, and can abandon farming to join the army when necessary. When he discovers that the old beliefs cannot protect him, he will throw himself into new beliefs.

II. The Birth and Growth of Chinese Communism A. The Origin of Chinese Communism

When communism was first introduced to China, China had already overthrown the Manchu Qing Empire (1911). This revolution suffered the same fate as most democratic revolutions. It failed to transform the Chinese people into a modern political society. At that time, China was divided by warlords, and the power of the Beijing government could not reach most areas.

Sun Yat-sen led the Kuomintang (KMT) to promote the reform movement. The Three Principles of the People were the central idea of ​​his doctrine. He clearly rejected Marxist communism, believing that Marx's "dialectical materialism" was a flawed view of history. Apart from this, the Three Principles of the People were easily misinterpreted by the Communist Party, which claimed to be loyal to this doctrine.

In early 1920, seven people claiming to be communists joined Professor Chen Duxiu to publish a proletarian newspaper in Shanghai and began to organize trade unions. Subsequently, similar organizations were found in Beijing, Hankou, and other cities.

In July 1921, Chinese Marxists held their first congress in Shanghai, formally establishing the Communist Party. This new political party grew quickly. Within a year, it had established its identity and was able to join the Communist International. The Bolshevik government of Soviet Russia immediately sent special agents to China. In September 1923, Moscow sent Borodin to Guangzhou. He told Moscow that the Kuomintang led by Sun Yat-sen was the most promising promoter of the Chinese revolutionary forces. Therefore, Moscow decided to support this political party. The CCP followed this resolution, and under the guidance and assistance of the Communist International, adopted the political line of a united front with the Kuomintang.

B. The First United Front—1924 to 1927

In 1924, the Kuomintang was reorganized and cooperated with the Communist Party, allowing Communist Party members to join the Kuomintang in their individual capacities. Thus, the national united front became a reality under the planning of Borodin and Sun Yat-sen. This was an alliance for the purpose of achieving national unity, a necessary first step to promote the future goals of the two parties.

In his book "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," Lenin stipulated that the Communist Party should not be isolated from reform movements. It must participate in these movements, but must not abandon its ultimate goals. Therefore, the style of the Communist Party stipulated by Lenin is between "reformism" and "left-wingism." This is the basis of the Communist Party's united front strategy.

The cooperative partners chosen by the Communist Party are socialist parties in industrial countries and nationalist movements in non-industrial countries. In China, the overriding issues were anti-imperialism and the development of the national government. China became the laboratory for the Communist Party's strategy towards non-industrial countries.

Initially, the CCP and Soviet advisors who cooperated with the Kuomintang were indeed of great value to the National Revolutionary Movement, but after Sun Yat-sen's death on March 12, 1925, the united front began to show cracks. Mr. Sun's "old comrades" were dissatisfied with the expansion of the power of the young generation in the revolutionary movement. In December, they convened the Xishan Conference, demanding the expulsion of Communist Party members from the Kuomintang, the dismissal of Borodin and other Soviet advisors, and the relocation of the Kuomintang Executive Committee headquarters from Guangzhou to Shanghai. The highest authorities of the Kuomintang condemned this independent action of the right wing. Under the urging of Chiang Kai-shek, the authorities took steps to prevent possible strikes by the left wing. At that time, the Kuomintang was planning to launch a large-scale crusade against the northern warlords and could not immediately break with the Communist Party.

The first KMT-CPC united front lasted only three years, from 1924 to the summer of 1927, after which it split again.

C. The Soviet Union and China

In the years after World War I, the Soviet Union wanted to take advantage of the chaos in China to gain benefits, and did its best to show its anti-imperialist theories and practical actions in China. This seemed like a complex policy in a divided China, and sometimes even a contradictory policy.

On January 26, 1923, Joffe, the representative of the Communist International in China, and Sun Yat-sen issued a joint statement in Shanghai, saying that communism or the Soviet system was not suitable for China's national conditions, and that the most urgent problem in China was to seek national unification and independence. Therefore, Joffe guaranteed that China would receive the sympathy of the Soviet people and the support of the Soviet government. In addition, the Soviet Union was willing to abandon the Tsarist era's demands on Manchuria and declared that the Soviet Union had no intention of dividing Outer Mongolia from China. These two interests of the Soviet Union were reaffirmed at the Yalta Conference in 1945 and recognized by the United States.

Sixteen months after the conclusion of this agreement, that is, on May 31, 1924, the Soviet Union and the Beiping government signed a treaty, mutually guaranteeing that there would be no groups opposing the other government within their respective national borders, and that neither government would engage in propaganda against the other's political or social system. This treaty also declared the abandonment of the interests of annexing Mongolia, and guaranteed the return of leased territories. Therefore, the Soviet Union was bound by the treaty and had to maintain a friendly and faithful attitude towards both sides of the Chinese civil war.

In 1927, the Nanjing National Government under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek did not restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Although the Communist Party established a weak and independent government in Central China in 1931 under the command and sponsorship of the Communist International, it did not receive diplomatic recognition from the Soviet Union. On the contrary, while the CCP openly condemned Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang, the Soviet Union restored diplomatic relations with the National Government on December 12, 1932. Moreover, when Chiang led China's war of resistance against Japan, the Soviet Union provided material assistance to the National Government rather than the Communist government.

D. The First Anti-Communist Civil War

After the Kuomintang army began the Northern Expedition in July 1926, it won successive victories. In the spring of 1927, it reached the Yangtze River and successively recovered Nanjing and Shanghai. At that time, the discipline of the national army was very good, but some Communist-dominated divisions violated discipline in Nanjing, carrying out large-scale looting and committing atrocities against foreigners and bourgeois people. This was the first incident since the establishment of the united front, clearly exposing the goals and methods of the Communist Party. The united front was declared dissolved at this time.

The Guangzhou government, dominated by the Communist Party, moved to Wuhan. Chiang Kai-shek, who commanded the troops in the north, set up independent headquarters in Nanchang and Nanjing. In April, Chiang launched a fierce crackdown on the Communist Party in Shanghai and other controlled areas, acting quickly and brutally.

The power of the Wuhan government declined day by day. In July, Communist Party members defected from Wuhan and joined forces with Communist Party members who had fled south from the Yangtze River and the north. They controlled a small area, organized an army, and established a Soviet government, implementing radical policies. The Communist army had only 10,000 men, but by 1930 it had increased to 62,000. In 1931, they convened a Communist Party congress and formulated the Constitution of Soviet China. (To be continued)
