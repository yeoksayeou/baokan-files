The other is to restore the credit of the legal tender, and announce the amount of legal tender issued on a regular basis. In fact, the amount of legal tender issued is less than what is speculated outside, but because the figures have not been announced for a long time, it has caused a lot of speculation. The general public has some doubts about the credit of the legal tender. After the government replenishes the legal tender fund, the amount issued can be announced truthfully, so that the credit of the legal tender can be quickly restored and people's hearts can be stabilized.

### US House Foreign Affairs Committee Drafts Comprehensive Bill Including Economic and Military Aid to China

[Our Newspaper News] New York, 15th (Broadcast): Washington News: The House Foreign Affairs Committee has begun drafting a comprehensive foreign aid bill, based on a blueprint by Republican leaders. They hope the bill can pass in the House by April 10th, allowing sufficient time to reach a compromise with the Senate and place the bill on President Truman's desk before the Italian elections on April 18th. The bill will include the European Recovery Program passed by the Senate, as well as economic aid to China and military aid to Greece and Turkey, with provisions for military aid to China.

[United Press, Augusta, Maine, 15th] Republican Senator Robert Taft, during a presidential campaign speech here on the 15th, said that the spread of communism in China is as dangerous as in Western Europe. Communism also poses a threat to Korea and Japan. Secretary of State Marshall, while acknowledging the danger of the Chinese Communists occupying North China and the Northeast, opposes military aid to the Nanjing government, which is contradictory. If North China and the Northeast are occupied by the Chinese Communists, the US position in Korea will be precarious, and soon Japan may be forced to fall into communism. The shores of the Pacific will then be filled with communist forces, which may be more dangerous than the situation in Eastern Europe.

### Adjustments to Income Tax Thresholds and Rates: Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee Slightly Reduces Them, Can Be Announced and Implemented After Completing Procedures

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] In order to increase national revenue, balance income and expenditure, and stabilize the economy, the Ministry of Finance has recently readjusted the income tax thresholds and rates for various items for the 37th year, and has obtained approval from the State Council. Before completing the legislative procedures, it will be implemented first. The adjusted table of income tax thresholds and rates for various categories has been sent to the Legislative Yuan for review.

### A New Page in International Cultural Cooperation

—From the UNESCO's Funding of Chinese Delegations to Eliminating Obstacles to Cultural Cooperation—

Recently, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) decided to use surplus funds from last year to grant six Chinese experts to study abroad. The Chinese Committee has nominated candidates, and their departure should not be far off. This is a meaningful new event in international cultural exchange work, and it may also provide a new hope for China's cultural education to further contribute to world peace.

UNESCO has only been in existence for a little over two years since its establishment in the UK in November 1945. Two conferences have already been held in Paris and Mexico. The meticulousness of the cultural charter's formulation, the large number of participating countries, and the broad scope of the undertaken projects can be said to have already achieved more than the "International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation" after World War I. It first launched basic education conferences for countries in the Far East, and it has given deep attention and assistance to China's cultural and educational sectors, which have suffered the most from the war. This passion and goodwill are truly what peace-loving Chinese people should be grateful for and cherish.

The six areas designated for this study tour are science and social development, audio-visual education, children's education, library science, educational administration, and art and music. I recall that one of the tasks set at the establishment of UNESCO was to "promote the free exchange of ideas among mankind through various educational organizations or methods (such as libraries, radio, exchange of teachers and students, etc.)". The aforementioned categories aim to assist China in fulfilling this task through these avenues. Therefore, although the scope of investigation and research varies, they should all have the common goal of promoting the exchange of ideas and cultural cooperation to contribute to world peace. Such a focused study, combined with the careful selection process, is clearly different from the general study or research abroad in the past. Its purpose is more serious, and its mission is even more significant.

From the long-term perspective of national and human culture, we are willing to place deep hope in the future trend of international cultural cooperation. For those who are sponsored by this international organization to study, we cannot help but expect them to achieve outstanding results. What we expect from them is, first, to have self-esteem and self-confidence. Although China is currently backward in science and its educational undertakings are underdeveloped, we must not be discouraged or belittle ourselves because of the current reality. We certainly have many things to learn from others. However, UNESCO's ideal is mutual assistance and cooperation, so we must not just unilaterally accept, but also emphasize fully exchanging opinions with people from other countries regarding general concepts and methods. China has an outstanding position in world culture and made great contributions and sacrifices to this World War, so we are confident that China should and will be able to make significant contributions to UNESCO's mission. The second is to have preparation and patience. Before departure, they must fully consider the specific issues that need attention. During the limited time of the study, they should carefully seek out information and make full use of it, striving to make a positive impact on the aforementioned various undertakings after returning to China.

Because of the general ignorance of European and American intellectuals about China, "many erroneous understandings and bizarre opinions have been formed". Therefore, a prerequisite for China's future international cultural cooperation is to have UN personnel more clearly understand the strengths and weaknesses of China's cultural traditions and the current general situation. This depends on our educators and specialists to speak out more abroad, and the study participants this time have an inescapable duty. The crux of China's current turmoil lies in the construction forces encountering destructive forces, the stabilizing forces frequently being disturbed, and good people being threatened and abused. China's cultural evolution is facing the most serious attack of new barbarism. Unless this violence is eradicated, China will not be able to contribute significantly to the great cause of cultural cooperation.

Moreover, the major premise of future world cultural cooperation is to guarantee international peace, and international peace must first have peace and progress within each country. However, today's world, although allied and looking at each other, maintains harmony on the surface, while international confrontation is forming and suspicions are deepening. Some economically and culturally backward countries in the East and West are filled with gunpowder and anxiety due to the Communist Party's constant disturbances, and education and culture are suffering severe damage. The goals set by UNESCO and the work it is striving for are precisely what the Communist Party wants to destroy. On the one hand, it seeks the development of science and society in various countries, while on the other hand, it destroys social stability and prosperity everywhere; on the one hand, it is enthusiastically planning the education of children after the war, while on the other hand, it is constantly creating (blank) and (blank) children and (blank) (blank). UNESCO wants to (blank) to various countries, (blank) books and cultural relics, stifle knowledge, and (blank), with (blank) and purposes, is to (blank) promote human cooperation and world peace through scientific, educational, and cultural cooperation; another international violence is destroying education and culture without (blank), destroying peace, in order to control mankind, and lead towards the end of culture.

China is an ancient civilization and is also an important (blank) in world peace today. Today's China is in a (blank) in which the people's livelihood is being threatened and culture (blank) is being devastated. With the rampant destruction of the Communist bandits' violence, China's education (blank) progress and cultural revival cannot be seen. With the existence of the Communist bandits, China cannot fulfill its mission for international educational and cultural cooperation.

The greatest enemy of China's cultural evolution is also the basic obstacle to world cultural cooperation. In the late Middle Ages in Europe, the destruction by (blank) was cursed as the enemy of civilization. Unexpectedly, in the evolution of culture to today, there is this new barbarism and new aggression being rampant, and it is the enemy of the UN's sacred cultural activities. Personnel from various countries participating in UNESCO should have a painful realization of this and develop effective international righteous public opinion and sanctions. Only in this way can the freedom of mankind from fear and lack be guaranteed, and only in this way can we fulfill our mission of guiding peace through culture, education, and science.

### Regarding This Year's Agricultural Loans

Whenever large quantities of agricultural products come on the market, various wholesalers find that their limited capital is insufficient for operation. Also, due to time constraints, they cannot afford to delay. Therefore, beforehand, they have to contact various associated firms and banks to secure funds for remittance. When the amount is large, exceeding what one or two firms or banks can handle, they often form a banking syndicate to jointly manage it. Cotton, wheat, silkworm cocoons, tea, etc. are examples of this.

After the war, due to various reasons, the production of various agricultural products has greatly decreased. However, the actual strength of merchants, who are nominally profitable but actually losing money, is also much less than before. The various firms and banks also have drastically reduced deposits and do not have large amounts of available funds to utilize. On the other hand, prices are surprisingly high, and the base prices are too high, so the need for working capital has greatly increased. Therefore, the financial responsibility that various firms and banks could previously shoulder has today inevitably shifted to national banks, as the only reliable backing.

The loan policy of national banks shifts with the country's economic policy. Whether or not to grant loans, the terms of the loan, and the target of the loan are not ultimately decided by the bank itself. At the same time, in order to (blank) the funds, and to turnover capital, they also have to request re-(blank) or re-(blank) from the central bank. Therefore, this type of funding for agricultural product purchases is in reality a (blank) government (blank) loan, and merchants requesting financing from banks are no different from seeking aid from the government. For this (blank) type of loan, it is often necessary to apply to the central government in advance. After approval, it is approved and handed over to a certain bank for handling, before all procedures can be carried out. This is an example.

However, the country's loan policy is not immutable. Sometimes it is looser, sometimes very strict, and sometimes it is directly rejected. Even during the periods when it is open, the focus and methods are often changing. If merchants cannot keep up, they can easily miss the opportunity. Therefore, in terms of procedures, they should strive to simplify and expedite the process.

Regarding the agricultural and land finance loan plan for the 37th year, totaling 15 trillion yuan, it was formally passed by the four-bank consortium on the 11th of this month. In addition to various other agricultural loans, tea loans amount to 80 billion yuan and sericulture loans amount to 150 billion yuan. Now that the specified amounts have been prepared for disbursement, it is expected that this year's tea and cocoon loans will not be delayed, unable to be processed, or hurriedly dealt with when things are critical. However, planning is one thing, and implementation is another. For example, when the loans are disbursed in the future, what method will be used? How will the interest rate be determined? Will the source of funds be entirely managed by the bank's own treasury? Regarding tea and cocoons, most are for export, but some are for domestic sales. Can this loan be uniformly included under the item of export trade enterprises? All these kinds of matters require supplementary adjustments or mutual consultations. In order to avoid the (blank) of handling too late, and to (blank) achieve the "greatest possible effect in accordance with the planned plans" as originally stipulated, we believe that all relevant parties should seize the opportunity and prepare quickly, in order to achieve a satisfactory solution. Everyone knows that agricultural loans should not only be a matter of facilitating merchants, but actually a matter of helping farmers, and not only a matter of helping farmers, but also a matter of maintaining production and increasing exports. If we really want to solve the current economic problems, then all the technical aspects of agricultural loans should not be taken lightly.

### Opening of the Beiping Municipal Assembly

The Chairman Sends a Telegram to Encourage the Implementation of the National Policy of Suppressing Rebellion

[Reported by our newspaper from Beiping on the 15th] The first session of the second assembly of the Beiping Municipal Assembly, with the first participation of the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party, opened at 8:00 AM today in Zhongnanhai. 121 councilors attended. Speaker Xu Huidong presided. Senior officials such as Fu Zuoyi and He Siyuan attended. Li Zongren was in Chengde to lead an oath-taking, and was represented by Feng Qinzai. In his speech, Fu emphasized two points: (1) The Chinese Communists have no basis for success, as long as the government is willing to change its working methods to meet actual needs. (2) Strengthen internal anti-espionage work. No matter what battlefield victories are gained outside, if internal spies are not eliminated, the purpose of suppressing the rebellion cannot be achieved. He Siyuan said in his speech: The participation of members of the Democratic Socialist Party and the China Youth Party this time can be a sign of the government expanding its base. Xu Huidong said: This session of the assembly will be devoted to stabilizing people's livelihoods and establishing military plans.

[Reported by our newspaper from Beiping on the 15th] The Beiping Municipal Assembly held its first session of the second assembly. Chairman Chiang sent a special telegram to encourage and commend, the original telegram is as follows: To all councilors of the Beiping Municipal Assembly: I have received your telegram of the 7th. Beiping is a military town in North China. Given the current military tensions, the city's position is even more important. I hope that all of you in this assembly will uphold your long-cherished desire to love your hometown and serve the nation and its people, lead the people, assist the government, earnestly maintain law and order, promote the national policy of suppressing rebellion, broadly expand your great plans, and benefit the local community. I hope we can all encourage each other. Chiang Kai-shek.

### Beijing-Shanghai Reporter Group Visits the First Tank Regiment in Xuzhou

Chiang Wei-kuo Personally Drives a Tank for Exercises

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 15th] The Beijing-Shanghai reporter group visited the First Tank Regiment and the Armored Forces School stationed in Xuzhou on the 15th. Regiment Commander Chiang Wei-kuo and School Principal Hu Xianqun received them separately, and guided them to visit the interior. Regiment Commander Chiang specially introduced the officers and soldiers of the regiment at all levels who had made contributions in the anti-Japanese war in Waluban, Burma, and who had recently returned from the front line of bandit suppression in western Shandong, to meet with the reporter group. Regiment Commander Chiang personally drove a tank, invited the reporter group to ride in it, and drove outside the regiment for an attack exercise.

### Shenyang Remittances Flourish

[Reported by our newspaper from Shenyang on the 15th] After the announcement of the method for the circulation of legal tender outside the customs and the revision of the exchange rate with circulating notes, the 14th was a Sunday. On the 15th, remittances at the banks and bureaus here were flourishing. More than 800 remittances were made abroad. Because official orders have not yet been received, the exchange rate is still calculated at 1 to 11.5. However, the Agricultural Bank has changed the exchange rate to 1 to 10. The exchange rate can be uniformly revised starting from the 16th.

[Reported by our newspaper from Shenyang on the 15th] Commodity prices in the Northeast will be slightly volatile due to the stimulus of the circulation of legal tender outside the customs. The signs are not yet obvious. Commodity prices in Shenyang rose on the 15th. Rice was 7,000, sorghum was 6,000, which was caused by the influence of Jilin and Siping. On the 14th, prices once fell due to the lower prices in Tianjin and Shanghai. How to transport a large amount of legal tender out of the customs is a problem.

### Wuxi's Credit Tightens, Jinan's Funds Flow South

[Reported by our newspaper from Wuxi on the 15th] Credit is tightening. National banks have entered more than 8 billion.

[Reported by our newspaper from Suzhou on the 15th] The weakness of the Suzhou rice market was only a flash in the pan. Today, grain merchants used the excuse of continuous rain and insufficient supply to raise prices again. Retail price of top-grade white rice is 3,600,000 yuan, an increase of 100,000 yuan from the previous day.

[Reported by our newspaper from Wuhu on the 15th] Machine rice is slightly lower, priced at 3,000,000 yuan, coarse xian rice at 2,550,000 yuan. With continuous overcast and rainy weather, the rape in the countryside around Wuhu is about to bloom. The harvest of yellow flowers is only 60 days away, and wheat is also showing its ears, which can predict a bountiful harvest.

[Reported by our newspaper from Jinan on the 15th] Commodity prices here have plummeted across the board due to the southward flow of funds. On the 14th, first-class flour had fallen to 1,900,000 yuan per bag, 20-count spider yarn was 84,000,000 yuan per piece, and black market gold was 31,000,000 yuan per tael.

Decided to Maintain Long-Term Plan Funding

[Reported by our newspaper] The Custody Committee of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission held its third general meeting in Nanjing on the 13th of this month to discuss the Yellow River Flood Area problem and the future plans of affiliated institutions. The committee decided that the funding for the long-term plan for the Yellow River Flood Area will still be maintained by the Custody Committee.

### British Foreign Secretary Bevin Formally Announces West Germany's Participation in European Recovery. Sixteen-Nation Conference Opened in Paris Yesterday. Spain Gains Support from Several Countries and May Also Participate.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 15th (broadcast): Paris report, the Sixteen-Nation European Conference opened at 14:04 standard time today in the "Clock Room" of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Except for Switzerland and Iceland, all foreign ministers attended in person. British Foreign Secretary Bevin announced that Britain and France would jointly propose including the British, American, and French occupied zones of Germany in the European Recovery Program, believing this to be the only way to ensure the participation of the defeated countries in the European Recovery.

[Reuters Paris, 15th] The Sixteen-Nation European Recovery Conference opened this afternoon in the Clock Room of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, chaired by French Foreign Minister Bidault. The first to arrive was British Foreign Secretary Bevin, followed by Italian Foreign Minister Sforza. After Bidault's welcoming speech, the chief representatives of each country spoke in succession. Bevin's important speech will be delivered at 4 pm this afternoon (midnight Shanghai time). Then, the sixteen nations' experts will meet at the luxurious Royal Monceau Hotel near the Arc de Triomphe.

[United Press Paris, 15th] It is expected here that British Foreign Secretary Bevin will deliver a historic declaration, outlining the new British continental policy. It is expected that Britain will, for the first time in history, express its willingness to ally with 270 million people in Western Europe to prevent the threat of communism. This alliance of sixteen European countries may grow into the United States of Europe, stretching from the Arctic in the north to the African continent in the south. However, this outcome depends on the new British foreign policy and the expression of widespread assistance from the United States. Subsequently, Britain and France will jointly take surprising actions, breaking away from their original policies, and propose granting Germany a voice in the committee working on the European aid plan.

[Reuters Paris, 15th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin arrived in Paris by train from London this morning. Staff from the British Embassy and French officials welcomed him at the station. Bevin went straight to the British Embassy to rest after getting off the train, and then went to the French Foreign Ministry to visit Bidault to discuss the details of West Germany's participation in the current conference. The principle of West Germany's participation in the conference was decided last night in a phone consultation between Paris, London, and Washington. Bevin is scheduled to leave Paris for Brussels tomorrow afternoon to sign the Five-Nation Western European Union Treaty on Wednesday.

[Agence France-Presse London, 15th] The Portuguese government notified the British Foreign Office on the 15th that Portugal had decided to recommend to the Sixteen-Nation Conference that Spain be included among the countries participating in the Marshall Plan.

[Reuters Paris, 15th] People here are making various speculations about the gains of this conference. The news that the US Senate approved the European Recovery Plan has shattered the politically oppressive atmosphere in Europe since the Czech coup. Parisians are most interested in the hope of Spain and Germany participating in the Marshall Plan. Italian Foreign Minister Sforza told reporters on the express train to Paris, "We must recognize that the time for organizing Europe is now. I have come to Paris with full confidence, because recent developments have made our countries have to reach an agreement."

[United Press Frankfurt, 15th] British officials announced today that German representatives will participate in the Paris conference as economic experts, along with representatives from the British and American military governments, to jointly discuss the Marshall Plan. This is an initiative for German representatives to participate in international conferences after the war. The German representatives will depart for Paris within days.

### Western European Foreign Ministers Gather in Paris; Conference Agenda Divided into Four Major Items

[Reuters Paris, 15th] Representatives of Western European countries attending the Marshall Plan conference will all deliver major policy speeches. Most participating countries will be personally represented by their foreign ministers. Those who have already arrived in Paris include British Foreign Secretary Bevin, Belgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Spaak, Dutch Foreign Minister Oostehof, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Beck, Swedish Foreign Minister Unden, Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange, Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen, Italian Foreign Minister Sforza, and Greek Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsaldaris. The first two days of the conference will consist of three plenary sessions, held on the afternoon of the 15th, and the morning and afternoon of the 16th, giving the sixteen national leaders a total of about eight hours (excluding translation time) to deliver their policy speeches.

The conference agenda is divided into four main categories: (1) Accepting reports on the decisions, actions and achievements of the sixteen countries since the Economic Cooperation Conference held last summer regarding self-help plans. (2) Accepting (perhaps without discussion) the investigation reports of the US Government Special Committee, each of which is a "national" and "item" report. (3) Establishing a working committee to draft the charter of a permanent institution of the sixteen countries, and to draft a multilateral agreement stipulating continued economic cooperation among them. Discussing the method and scope for German participation in future meetings of the Economic Cooperation Committee.

The main tasks of the conference can be summarized as follows: In the political sphere, it will demonstrate that the countries outside the Soviet sphere of influence in Europe have decided to unite and work together to achieve political stability through planned economic recovery. In the economic sphere, it is currently the last opportunity before the US Congress reaches a decision on the European Recovery Plan to prepare a balance sheet of Europe's self-help plans and achievements, and to establish the necessary working institutions to handle US aid with the highest degree of efficiency.

The plenary session of the conference is expected to be completed within this week. The plenary sessions of the first two days will consist of policy speeches by the chief representatives of each country. The plenary sessions of the next two or three days will consist of discussions by senior representatives of each delegation, after which the working committee formed by the experts' committee will begin the detailed task of establishing a permanent institution. The task of the working committee will take approximately three to five weeks to complete, with the hope that it can be completed around the time the US Congress passes the European Recovery Plan, so that a third plenary session of the Sixteen-Nation Economic Cooperation Committee can be convened after the European Recovery Plan becomes law.

### International Chamber of Commerce Has Drafted Action Plan for European Recovery

Prepared to Submit to Paris Conference

[Reuters Paris, 15th] An action plan for European recovery, jointly drafted by industrial and commercial leaders and experts from ten countries, will be submitted to the Sixteen-Nation Marshall Plan Conference today by the President of the International Chamber of Commerce, Keynes. The plan believes that any country has the moral right to request assistance only after it has fully and effectively utilized its existing resources and equipment. Temporarily reversing the trend of shortening working hours, and abolishing restrictions imposed by both labor and capital, can reduce the amount of assistance needed and help Europe become self-reliant. The plan also states that the most important responsibility of European governments is to prevent post-war inflation by balancing income and expenditure and not over-extracting national resources. State-owned enterprises should at least break even, and the number of civil servants should be reduced to serve productive enterprises. Income from assistance should not be used for unnecessary expenses, but should be used to combat inflationary trends, to achieve "deflation without tears." Participants in the International Chamber of Commerce's plan include experts from Britain, the United States, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

### Taft Believes Situation Not Serious

Does Not Agree with Byrnes's Remarks

[Reuters, Massachusetts, Quinton, 14th] Republican Senator Taft stated today that he could not agree with former Secretary of State Byrnes's statement yesterday that the United States would face a crisis with the Soviet Union within four to five weeks. He felt that until recently, the Soviet Union had only consolidated its position within the Soviet sphere of influence confirmed by the Yalta Agreement. As far as Czechoslovakia is concerned, the country was already under Soviet control before the Communist coup, and this event was merely a means of consolidating its position. He also said that the current world situation is still a war of influence, not a military war. If the Communist Party wins the general election in Italy, it is not a military action, and there is nothing the United States can do about it. The Marshall Plan will not produce results until at least six months later. Finally, he said that if the United States thinks that the actions of the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia and Italy are a war, it is inevitably making trouble for itself.

### Marshall Testifies Before Senate Foreign Relations Committee Requesting Aid for Greece and Turkey; Italy's Inclination to Communism Will Result in Loss of US Aid

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 15th (broadcast): Washington report, Secretary of State Marshall, in order to support the new military aid of 275 million US dollars to Greece and Turkey, appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today and stated that our country must avoid fear that would cause action to come to a standstill, and cannot act hastily, resulting in wasted resources. He said that due to the Communist Party's means of terror and fraud, the situation in Europe is more serious than it was a year ago.

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 15th (broadcast): Washington report, the State Department stated frankly today. If the Italian Communist Party wins the election on April 18, Italy will no longer receive US aid.

[United Press Washington, 15th] Marshall may advise the US Congress within this week that steps other than the European Recovery Plan are needed to prevent Soviet expansion. In Marshall's plan to cope with what he calls the "extraordinarily serious" world crisis, increasing military strength may be included. Marshall will hold several closed-door meetings with Congress this week. The meeting with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 15th was his first. Congress is now gradually increasing pressure, demanding that Marshall frankly explain the current world situation.

Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, demanded that the government explain the severity of the current threat of war. He said: "We want to know in detail how we will deal with this." It is believed that the government's plan to deal with the world crisis has not yet been formulated. It is still under discussion, and when this plan is formulated, Truman may issue a stern statement. This development would be tantamount to informing the Soviet Union that continued expansion to the West would be regarded as a threat to world peace and American security. Marshall will request support for his 275 million US dollar military aid proposal to Greece and Turkey at the Appropriations Committee today. When Marshall attends the Senate Armed Services Committee on the 16th, Chairman Gainey will ask Marshall about his needs and reasons. Many senators believe that the European Recovery Plan alone is not enough to stop communism in Europe. For months, Marshall has believed that the Recovery Plan is the best way to stop communism, but may eventually agree with the senators' opinions. The problem lies in how to prevent the indirect infiltration of the Communist Party. President Truman called on the United States to recognize that this "indirect action" against free people is a threat to the world and the United States. The most important situation currently is the situation in Italy.

### Hungarian Independence Anniversary

Representatives from Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Other Countries Participate

[Agence France-Presse Budapest, 14th] The centenary of Hungarian independence will be celebrated with a grand ceremony tomorrow. Government delegations from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia, and private delegations from France, Italy, and Austria, were all received by the President today.

### Western European Defense Treaty May Expand in Scope; US to Be Asked to Guarantee Military Assistance

[Agence France-Presse Ankara, 14th] Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris issued a statement saying that he would study the possibility of concluding a treaty between Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Greece, and Turkey in Paris. The Turkish political community was greatly excited by this news, as this treaty had long been hoped for by Turkey. It is now believed that if this treaty is sponsored by the United States, it can be discussed outside of the Sixteen-Nation Conference in Paris.

[United Press London, 14th] Responsible diplomatic officials declared today: The five-nation treaty between Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg will be signed this Wednesday. The second step will be to seek a firm guarantee from the United States that it will send troops to help when necessary. The representatives of the five countries at the Brussels conference had already unanimously agreed that the US foreign policy, regardless of which party is in power, must now actively participate in the European situation, and what needs to be obtained thereafter is a formal guarantee of full-scale participation in the war immediately in the event of an emergency. If this guarantee can be clearly announced, it will be enough to deter any aggressor. If the United States takes this action, its current foreign policy must be greatly expanded.

### US Administration Plans to Request Congress to Take Military Measures Against Soviet Union; National Defense Conference of Army, Navy, and Air Force Has Adjourned

[United Press Washington, 14th] The US administration plans to request Congress to take military preparation measures to back up the US's strong statement to the Soviet Union. The gist of the statement is that any further Soviet aggression against Europe would be a dangerous move. According to senior sources: This motion is currently under active consideration by the US Cabinet and members of the Senate and House of Representatives. The purpose of this motion is to give the Soviet Union a clear warning, indicating that the United States considers future Communist expansion, especially the Communist Party seizing power in Italy, to be a threat to US security. However, well-informed sources insist that due to the broad and complex implications of this motion, it is currently under discussion and no decision has been made.

[United Press Washington, 14th] The Army announced on the night of the 14th that the conference convened by Secretary of Defense Forrestal and his chiefs of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in Key West, Florida, had adjourned. Forrestal convened the weekend "countryside conference" to resolve broad disputes between the three services regarding the military strategic plans adopted in the national defense plan. He also stated that the conference would determine who would assume what tasks with what weapons, according to the Armed Forces Merger Act. Forrestal in Florida will now inspect several military bases in the state. A report on this conference may be issued after Forrestal returns here.

### Soviet-Finnish Treaty Negotiations to Begin on 22nd

Stalin Notifies Finnish Government

[Report from this newspaper] London, 15th (broadcast): Moscow report, Stalin has notified the Finnish government that the Soviet Union is prepared to begin negotiations with Finland on a mutual assistance treaty on March 22nd. The Finnish President had previously announced that the Finnish delegation could depart for Moscow at any time after March 20th.

### US Prime Minister Vigorously Condemns the Communists; 30,000 Women in Rome Hold Anti-War Demonstration; National Situation Tense as General Election Approaches

[Associated Press Rome, 14th] Prime Minister De Gasperi today delivered an election campaign speech, vehemently denouncing the Communist Party. It is said that the Communist Party is plotting illegal actions in Italy. The Italian Communist Party has long been part of an international movement and cannot be cooperated with. The people once lost their freedom due to the dictatorship of the Italians, and should be careful not to lose it again in the future. The next time it will not be a dictatorship of the Italians, but a dictatorship from another country.

[Reuters Rome, 14th] Thirty thousand Italian women held an anti-war march in the streets of Rome today, shouting slogans such as "Down with the atomic bomb." They came from all over the country and were representatives of women's groups affiliated with the "Peace Tribunal" (the name of the Italian peace movement). Before the march, a conference was held, where several representatives, including Irene Curie, a famous scientist and daughter of radium discoverers Pierre and Marie Curie, delivered anti-war speeches, demanding universal disarmament and the destruction of atomic bombs. Afterwards, a delegation met with President Einaudi, presenting a "Peace Declaration" signed by two million women. The march dissolved in front of the Italian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

[United Press Rome, 14th] According to a survey conducted on the 14th in five major Italian cities, it has been proven that wealthy Italian families are preparing to flee the country quickly if the Communist Party wins the Italian general election on April 18th. This survey, conducted in Turin, Milan, Genoa, Mima, and Naples, has proven that passport applications in Milan are thirteen times higher than usual, ten times higher in Rome, and slightly lower in other cities. Requests for new investment in industrial production and commercial activities have now completely ceased. In short, the upcoming Italian general election is a total duel between the Communist Party and non-Communist parties for control of Congress and the government. World opinion is also focused on this election, which may determine who controls the Mediterranean, the success or failure of the Marshall Plan, and the fate of the global Catholic center in Rome. Current opinion believes that the Communist front will gain 35% to 40% of the vote, and may even have 45% to 50% of the votes. Communist leader Togliatti gave two speeches in Turin, attacking the Marshall Plan's attempt to use Italy as a base for an anti-Soviet atomic war, and called for the left wing to win in the April election to "save peace."

### The Soviet Union Requests Trade Agreement Negotiations with Italy

To Proceed Simultaneously with Reparations Issues

[Central News Agency London, 14th, United Press] TASS Moscow reports that the Soviet Union has notified the Italian government, requesting reparations payments and proposing that negotiations on a treaty of commerce and navigation between the two countries proceed simultaneously. The Soviet note to Italy on March 9 stated that if an agreement on reparations is reached, then all economic and trade relations between the two countries can be determined. The Soviet Union also stated that the treaty of commerce and navigation between the two countries should be based on the principle of most-favored-nation status.

### The British Government Decides to Purge Extremists from Government Agencies

[Our Report] London, 15th Broadcast: British Prime Minister Attlee told the House of Commons that the British government will purge Communist Party members and similar elements from government agencies that handle national secrets and security secrets.

The United States' attitude was decided after Chief Representative Austin consulted with the State Department.

### Four-Power Talks on Palestine Issue Fail; Arab Foreign Ministers Meet Today

[Reuters Lake Success, 15th] The office of Austin, the US representative to the United Nations, announced that the four powers, China, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, discussed the situation in Palestine, but failed to formulate a common plan and will report to the Security Council when it meets today. It is said that China, the United States, and France agree to amend the UN General Assembly's partition resolution as another attempt to find a peaceful solution, but the Soviet Union insists that the UN General Assembly resolution cannot be changed and should be implemented as originally stipulated. Since an agreement was not reached, the four powers will submit individual reports to the Security Council. The issue of international troops was not specifically discussed in the four-power talks. The four powers will hold a final meeting at the Chinese delegation's office this afternoon to listen to the opinions of Nakleh, the representative of the Palestinian Arab Higher Committee.

### Former Annamese Prime Minister Writes to Bao Dai; Urges Cooperation with Ho Chi Minh; France Adopts a Policy of Division in Vietnam

[Reuters Saigon, 15th] Former Annamese Emperor Prime Minister, Phung Quoc Huy, wrote a letter to Annamese Emperor Bao Dai, stating that attempts to cooperate with the French to resist the Viet Minh government will indefinitely prolong the Vietnamese resistance movement. Phung is currently in the Viet Minh-controlled area. He said that 99% of the military and political news released by the French regarding Vietnam is untrue. What the French have adopted is a policy of dividing Vietnam in order to carry out their dark plan of conquest. Phung said that the French have launched offensives in southern Tokyo for two years and in northern Tokyo for one year. Except for some major cities, the entire territory is under the control of the Viet Minh. Even in the cities occupied by the French army, most residents are still openly or secretly fighting for their country. 90% of the people have always supported the Viet Minh government. People have absolute trust in President Ho Chi Minh of the Viet Minh government. This is because the Viet Minh prioritizes national interests. The Viet Minh army is sufficient to engage in a war of independence. We have seen our arsenals manufacturing weapons and ammunition day and night, and we have also seen French planes and warships shot down or sunk. In the French autumn offensive last year, the enemy deployed more than 10,000 troops from the army, navy, and air force in an attempt to eliminate the Viet Minh government and army. However, from October 7 to December 17, the French army lost more than 3,000 officers and soldiers, 11 ships, and 4 landing ships. At the beginning of the offensive, the French claimed to have occupied three-quarters of Tokyo. Now, the French army has withdrawn from the seven major cities of Tokyo. Phung's letter continued: I recently heard that Your Excellency intends to organize a government that opposes the Viet Minh regime. President Ho Chi Minh and the people of the Viet Minh know that Your Excellency is unwilling to be used by the French. Most Vietnamese will regard the government manufactured by France as the enemy's government. Your Excellency's reputation will be damaged, and the war of resistance in Vietnam will be prolonged indefinitely. The people in the country hope that Your Excellency will cooperate with President Ho Chi Minh to seek the independence and unity of the motherland.

Students from various universities, upon hearing the news, gathered more than 1,000 people and lined up at the entrance of the District Court, requesting to enter and listen in. The District Court issued more than 60 hearing passes yesterday, and those without passes were not allowed to enter. The iron gate was tightly closed, and the situation was tense. Deputy Police Chief Wang Yongchang and Pan Yuyi, along with 40 bailiffs, went to guard the premises. Lu Dagong, Chief of the Police Guard Division of the Police Department, also rushed to the scene with a large number of police officers. The students were still orderly. The presidium was temporarily set up on the upper floor of the Tongfang Teahouse across from the District Court. Amplifiers were placed, and orders were issued, singing and shouting slogans. The sound shook the universe. Fortunately, the District Court had taken precautions in advance, and the trial proceeded as usual.

The trial began at 9:00 a.m. The eleven defendants stood in the defendant's column. Prosecutor Huang Daping of the District Prosecutor's Office ascended the seat and stated the main points of the indictment, saying that the defendants were all young students who had violated the law due to temporary impulsiveness and had been prosecuted according to the law. However, considering that the defendants did not have general criminal malice, it was requested that they be treated leniently. Then, Presiding Judge Hu interrogated each of them individually. The eleven defendants, including Huang Kelu, unanimously denied assaulting Mayor Wu, claiming that the police cavalry charged in, and at that time, many students were surrounding Mayor Wu for negotiations. It was too late to dodge, causing some to fall, which caused Mayor Wu to be pushed down. Regarding who threw stones at the cavalry, they all claimed they did not see it.

### Huangpu Deputy Chief Testifies, Personally Saw Sun Kezai Make a Move

At this time, someone suddenly shouted to hit him, and Sun immediately moved to hit the mayor. Pan Chengbang hugged his waist from behind and tripped the mayor. I saw these two people with my own eyes. Wang Gongwei was not at the scene. I did not see clearly whether Qu Yuping made a move. I heard Feng Liwen shout, "Don't hit the mayor."" Then, witnesses Zhou Zhiyu, Shen Zuxuan, Liu Zhilu, Rong Lifang, Wu Hong, Lin Jiamei, Du Chengliang, and Ji Dabin were called to hear their testimonies. Temporarily, the defendants proposed witnesses Deng XianZhao, Fei Bingyin, and Cao Shishen, who gave their testimonies.

Before Presiding Judge Hu left the court, two female students suddenly stood on top of the gallery and raised two red silk flags that had been hidden in advance, one with the words "Heroic Struggle, Strong Will" and the other with the words "Steel Is Forged That Way." Another female student held a bunch of flowers and presented them to the arrested students. The eleven defendants saw this and applauded enthusiastically. They were stopped by the bailiffs and returned to custody. After the defendants' lawyers left the court, the students in the gallery also presented them with a bunch of flowers and a white cloth square, with the words "The law is the purest, whoever pollutes it is our enemy" printed in red. The court was adjourned at 12:00 noon.

The students outside the door, upon hearing that the trial inside the court had been completed, issued an order from the upper floor of the Tongfang Teahouse, four people in a row, to return to school in formation, shouting slogans along the way, and distributing leaflets "Our Accusations" before dispersing.

The rice ration for police officers in this city was originally five dou, but police officers were treated the same as ordinary civil servants.

The Municipal Government now believes that police officers are also responsible for maintaining law and order, and their rice ration should not be less than that of the police. Therefore, it has been increased to five dou. In addition, technicians, drivers, and foremen in the Health and Public Works Bureaus were originally paid wages according to the rate for laborers, but their in-kind rations were the same as those of the staff. Since the reduction in rice rations, it has become increasingly difficult for them to make ends meet. The Municipal Government is currently considering providing them with rice at parity prices.

### The Case of Bao Chief Xue Being Killed for Rescuing Allied Soldiers; Two Japanese War Criminals Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday; Kuboe Yasuharu and Noma Teiji Executed Simultaneously; Request to Bathe and Change Clothes and Write Wills Before Execution

[Report from our newspaper] Two Japanese war criminals, Kuboe Yasuharu and Noma Teiji, were sentenced to death by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense and recently approved for execution by a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. At 11:00 AM yesterday, prosecutor Xu Naikun, accompanied by interpreter Wang Renming, clerk Wang Chenghua, and a squad of military police, went to the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison to temporarily set up a public case, sign and bring the criminals, verify their identities, and ask their names, ages, and origins. They were then informed that they had been approved for execution today, and if they had any last words. The two criminals turned pale upon hearing this. They then requested to bathe and change their clothes and wrote seven wills in front of the public case. While writing, they frequently asked for cigarettes and drinking water, as if they could not bear the irritability. It took an hour to finish. The military police then escorted the two criminals to the prison execution ground, where squad leader Deng Dechang and military police Ren Kunxiang executed them with wooden shell guns, each hitting one bullet and ending their lives. The time was 12:45 PM. Kuboe Yasuharu, 35 years old, from Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, served as a warrant officer squad leader in the Special Higher Police Section of the Japanese Shanghai Gendarmerie Pudong Branch during the war. Noma Teiji, 30 years old, from Hiroshima Prefecture, served as a sergeant in the Special Higher Police Section of the branch. On January 20, 1945, U.S. Fourteenth Air Force pilot Tollett was piloting a bomber that attacked Longhua Airport and was hit by Japanese anti-aircraft artillery. Tollett parachuted and landed in Xuejia Hamang South First, Sanlin Town, Pudong. He was spotted by Xue Heshang, the Bao Chief of the local Fourth Bao, who rescued him and handed him over to the guerrillas to escort him to a safe area. After learning of the information, Kuboe Yasuharu personally led the gendarmerie to Xuejia Hamang to guard and search. Because they found nothing, they surrounded the Xuejia Zhai village and, together with Noma Teiji, arrested the residents of the area and interrogated them with torture. They then went to the Xuejia Zhai and arrested Xue Heshang. After tying him up, they hung him up and brutally beat him all over his body with door bolts and bamboo poles, causing his head to be broken and his right arm to be broken. He died of serious injuries. After the victory, the local residents and victims identified and detained them. After several court hearings by Shi Meiyu, the presiding judge of the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals, they were found to have irrefutable evidence and were each sentenced to death.

[Report from our newspaper] After Sun Xiaojun, the chief secretary of Bachuan Bank, committed suicide by lying on the tracks in Wuxi, the coffin has been transported from Wuxi to Nanjing.

There was no car in the house, only a tricycle for transportation.

### Two Railway Bureaus Strengthen Driving Safety; Double-Line Signals Installed at Wuxi Station

[Report from our newspaper] In order to strengthen driving safety, facilitate vehicle dispatching, and improve driving efficiency, the Two Railway Bureaus decided to install CTC central control driving signals throughout the line. However, due to economic limitations, it is difficult to achieve in a short period of time. During this transition period, the railway bureau plans to install an additional "outer entry signal" at each station with particularly busy vehicle allocation and bay access, in addition to the original entry signal. The signal is one kilometer away from the station and cannot be controlled by the original single-line signal. The Works Department decided to use a double-line signal. This type of signal is used for the first time in domestic railways. Its advantages are that it can automatically adjust the line, is flexible, and is not affected by climate change. In particular, the control distance is long, and it has a safety device. If any accident causes the line to be interrupted, it can immediately show a dangerous image. The bureau has now selected the two ends of Wuxi Station for trial installation. These two new signals have been installed yesterday and are now in use.

### The Murderer in the Shandong Road Case Was Arrested Yesterday; He Suddenly Had the Intention to Kill After Failing to Borrow Money; He Was Finally Caught While Visiting His Mistress

[Report from our newspaper] On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, a murder case for money occurred on the overpass of Chaozongfang on Shandong Road and Hankou Road. Fang Wu, the wife of a News Newspaper worker, was strangled to death. The previous report has been published. The murderer, Zhang Xiaoshan (21 years old) from Pudong, was arrested by the Huangpu Police Branch after two days of strict investigation, at 1:00 PM yesterday, in the Wanli Socks Factory at No. 22 Qing'anli, Tangjiawan Road. At that time, the criminal still tried to deny it, but after being taken to the bureau for interrogation and finding a paper for a pawnshop that was from the golden ring that was stolen from the dead Fang Wu, he confessed without hesitation. After the case occurred, Zhang Renyou, the director of the Huangpu Police Branch, ordered Li Yinmin, the head of the second unit, to solve the case within a time limit. Li personally led unit members Ren Fengwu, Gan Guiliang, Yang Weizhou, etc., to Pudong Nanshi and other places to investigate in the rain that night. They then learned that the murderer had a mistress named Wang Wenxian, also known as Li Guifang, who often worked in a sock factory near Xieqiao in Nanshi. They sent personnel to investigate, but the results were fruitless. However, they only knew that Wang often went to the Wanli Socks Factory to work temporarily, so they left police officers to wait. Until 1:00 PM yesterday, the murderer Zhang Xiaoshan went to the factory to visit his mistress and was arrested by the police officers who were waiting. According to Zhang, he originally intended to borrow a gold ring from Fang Wu, but was refused and insulted. He then took out a pre-prepared rope, put it around her neck. At that time, Fang Wu struggled hard, causing Zhang's cheeks to be covered with claw marks, which had not yet faded. After Zhang escaped, he took the gold ring to Lihe Pawnshop at No. 115 South Zhengzheng Road, pawned it for 4.5 million yuan in legal currency, bought a new set of clothes (the clothes he was wearing in the bureau), and rented Room 21 of the Gaosheng Hotel in Caojiadu. He only watched movies for entertainment every day. However, the good times did not last long. He only had 186,000 yuan left in legal currency, and he felt financially strapped. Therefore, he specifically visited Wang Wenxian yesterday afternoon, intending to borrow money from Wang to make a living, and was arrested.

### Representatives of the Relief Association for the Shin Hsin Incident Visit the Families of the Dead, Injured, and Arrested Workers

[Report from our newspaper] Workers in various industries in this city expressed their sympathy for the workers who died tragically in the Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory incident. They formed the "Shanghai Trade Unions Relief Association for the Shin Hsin Incident." In addition to asking the authorities to severely punish the perpetrators who violated the law, they also requested that the innocent be released as soon as possible. The association sent representatives Xu Zhouliang, Wang Guorong, Shao Yuben, Yang Jingen, Le Xiuzhang, Zhang Rulin, Wan Baoying, Tan Zaixi, etc., to visit the families of the dead, injured, and detained. One of the three female workers who died tragically was Jiang Zhenxin, 17 years old, who lived at No. 8, Lane 454, Jianguo East Road. Each Zhuyunxian, 24 years old, lived at No. 216 Wuchang Road. Each of their families was sent a condolence money of 20 million yuan. Another female worker who died tragically was named Wang Mumei, 23 years old. Because her family was in Hangzhou, the condolence money of 20 million yuan was received on her behalf by her relative, Sun Jingwen, from the Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory. The visiting representatives also went to Hongren Hospital to visit the two injured workers, each sending a condolence money of 2.5 million yuan and condolences such as milk, flowers, fruit, and biscuits. Each of the families of the 38 arrested workers was also sent 2.5 million yuan. For those without family members, the representatives went directly to the police station to visit the detainees and sent bread, Chinese cabbage, and other items.

Innocent Dismissals - Confirmed and Approved for Reinstatement

According to Zhao Banfu, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, he told reporters: After the Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory incident occurred, various parties expressed their sympathy for the workers who died. However, a small number of people have ulterior motives and contain political effects, stirring up trouble everywhere, fabricating facts, which is not allowed by law. The government considers good-faith sympathy and relief to be reasonable, so the Social Affairs Bureau does not stop the "Shanghai Trade Unions Relief Association for the Shin Hsin Incident" from providing assistance to the distressed workers. After the Shin Hsin No. 9 Factory incident occurred, 340 workers who were considered to have participated in the sabotage were dismissed. Among them, it is inevitable that there are innocent victims, so the Public Security Bureau is investigating from all aspects. So far, nearly 100 workers have been found to be innocent after interrogation and have been ordered by the factory to be reinstated.

### Observing the War Situation in Xuzhou

[Report from our newspaper, Xuzhou, 12th] Arriving in Xuzhou during the New Year, it is a relatively tense period militarily. The bandit troops in northern Jiangsu are stirring in various areas, and the National Army is also actively operating in areas such as Dangshan Huangkou and Donghai. At this time, the highest authorities personally came to Xuzhou on the 9th to inspect special forces and preside over important meetings, staying for three days. These objective situations make people somewhat tense. However, most of the residents here are accustomed to living in a wartime atmosphere. Some have experience with besieged city life, so they are naturally more firm and calm. Soldiers are everywhere on the streets of Xuzhou. Most of the important buildings are used by military agencies. The vehicles speeding by on the roads are not comfortable sedans but heavy military vehicles. Especially at major intersections, strong steel and concrete bunkers are built, which can be immediately turned into strongholds when necessary. Traffic is directed not by traffic police but by soldiers. On Zhongzheng Road in Xuzhou, there are several large buildings such as the telecommunications bureau, built by the Japanese during the enemy and puppet period. The construction is extremely solid. At that time, the Japanese prepared them as the final strongholds for street fighting in case of emergency. Last winter, when the bandit troops once approached Xuzhou, the artillery on Jiuli Mountain in the north began firing. The National Army authorities here also made preparations for emergencies. The surroundings of several large buildings were equipped with electric fences and communication trenches. Now, the threat to Xuzhou has long been lifted, but traces of the defense remain. Therefore, although military operations are taking place 200 li outside of Xuzhou, the city is still a wartime scene.

Bandit Troop Actions Are Evasive

The day after the reporters arrived in Xuzhou (the 11th) happened to be when the Chairman was stationed there, and the Army Headquarters was extremely busy. It was not until 3:00 PM yesterday, after the Chairman returned to Nanjing, that the headquarters resumed normal activities. Today, our group visited Guo Rugui, Chief of Staff of the Army Headquarters. He previously served in the Ministry of National Defense and has only been working at the headquarters for a year, but his understanding of the enemy situation and his views on the suppression of the rebellion are exceptionally profound. He believes that the strength of the bandit troops is that their actions are evasive and unpredictable. The situation outside the customs is complex, and other factors besides military ones are involved, so he did not want to discuss it. Regarding the suppression of the rebellion within the customs, he believes that the most important thing is to not allow the communists to establish a base. Those that have already been established must be driven out, and then they must be pushed to the point of no return and finally eliminated.

Pursuit Methods Are Effective

This naturally includes a long-term, continuous pursuit process. This method has proven effective. For example, during the Shandong campaign last year, Chen Yi's Tenth Column was eventually forced to the dead end of the Yellow River Delta after being constantly pursued. More than 4,000 of them were eliminated in one fell swoop. This was the only true instance of annihilation. Because of the continuous pursuit, the bandit troops are bound to abandon a lot of equipment and will not be able to obtain replenishment afterwards. At the same time, the cadres of their troops, under extreme hardship, may defect and surrender. During the Battle of Central Shandong last year, many of the remnants of Chen Yi's First and Fourth Columns surrendered under the aforementioned difficult circumstances. Some bandit soldiers were probably coerced, ignorant people, and during the pursuit of the large army, they even hid in military vehicles on the Jinpu Railway. It was not until the train arrived in Jiangsu that they were discovered, and more than 100 people were captured! Guo believes that when the cadres of the bandit troops can no longer mentally endure the pursuit of the large army, that will be the time to achieve complete success in suppressing the rebellion. Secretary of State Marshall once said during the military mediation that "the communist army has hundreds of thousands of cadres who are willing to sacrifice for their cause, so they should not be underestimated." Now, many have already sacrificed, and there is a deep sense of a lack of capable cadres.

An Example from the Late Qing Dynasty of Suppressing the Nian Rebellion

To make it easier to understand, Guo compared the military situation to the suppression of the Nian rebellion during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods of the Qing Dynasty. He believes that the communist army's current strategy of looting and fleeing is quite similar to that of the Taiping Army and the Nian bandits in those days. The bandits are most afraid of natural obstacles, especially large rivers. Shi Dakai, the Wing King of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, was very talented, but on the route of the Western Expedition, he was always restricted by the Yangtze River and finally failed at the Dadu River. When he first crossed Guizhou, he recruited 200,000 soldiers locally. When he left Yunnan, the crowd had grown to 500,000. This situation is very similar to the communist army's "join the army" method today. But these are all coerced, and they will collapse once they reach a dead end. Numbers are useless. When Zeng Guofan was suppressing the Nian rebellion, he also used rivers to shrink the activities of the Nian bandits. These historical lessons are still valuable for reference in today's military suppression. As for the combat power of the bandit troops, he does not estimate it too highly. He said: "Statistics show that in recent years, 80% of the losses suffered by the National Army in various places are due to the negligence of the generals, who do not carefully study the terrain through which they are marching. Therefore, they fall into the ambush of the bandits. The recent small setback in Yichuan is also this situation. The communist army within the customs is not qualified to attack fortified positions. Judging from the past records in Shandong, attacking fortified positions is when they suffer great defeats.

Using Civilian Labor Situation

One thing worth noting is that the bandit troops are currently supplying and expanding locally. Under this method, it is easier for their generals to develop their talents. For example, Chen Yi did not have a high reputation among the bandit army generals in the past, but in the group of three, when discussing the candidates for the commander of the two communist army corps, they nominated Peng Dehuai, which was natural, but instead of recommending Lin Biao or others, they nominated Chen Yi, which was quite surprising. And the basis for their nomination was focused on the replenishment and expansion of troops."

"The bandit troops now have no base and no supply organization. Not only do they take everything from the people for food, but they also use civilian labor entirely for carrying stretchers. Because their control is strict, the people cannot escape corvée labor. My personal estimate is that the civilian labor force in the bandit army is at least eight to ten times larger than that of the National Army. The people are really overwhelmed. Recently, the Shandong bandit army has even put forward the slogan of 'saving manpower,' which can also prove the extent to which the bandit army is harassing the people. Because they rely on local supplies for everything, they have many civilian cadres stationed to strengthen their control. This is also the main reason why the National Army often falls into ambushes when entering bandit areas.

How to Deal with Rural Cadres

The most effective way to deal with this group of "rural cadres" is to eliminate them, otherwise the bandit army cannot be eliminated for a day if the "rural cadres" exist. For example, the triangular area of Shanxian, Chengwu, and Dangshan counties and the old Kaocheng area of Henan are generally referred to as bandit areas. But the common people have never been bandits; it's just that the communist cadres control them strictly. In these two areas, tunnels are built everywhere and connected to each other, so they can repeatedly evade the National Army's offensives. In the future, the elimination of these areas will still depend on the continuous pursuit of the National Army, but establishing local armed forces is the fundamental solution. The correct use of local armed forces should not be for frontal offense and defense, but to eliminate the civilian cadres left behind by the bandit army."

The Possibility of Crossing the River

People from the Nanjing-Shanghai area are very concerned about the communist bandits' slogan of "crossing the Yangtze River in May." The reporter asked Chief of Staff Guo to make a judgment on the possibility of this happening. His views are very correct and worth special introduction. He said: "This is possible. In the future, cadres and small groups of bandit troops will definitely cross the river in succession and slowly establish their strength. Their current strategy is to make 'your cadres also my cadres,' that is, to create some 'double-faced Baojia chiefs,' using threats and inducements to turn the good people on the south bank into their tools. Before their strength is established, they will not have a large-scale crossing of the river, but when the local communists have considerable momentum, they will choose an inconspicuous location to sneak across. Although the Dabie Mountain area is currently controlled by the National Army, the local communists have not been completely eliminated and deserve close attention." How to mobilize civilian power and eliminate "rural cadres" is not a purely military issue, but a reform that needs to be combined with politics and economics. The reporter arrived in Xuzhou a few days ago and contacted various parties. I deeply feel that the military and political personnel here have a new understanding of "knowing the enemy and knowing yourself." This is what the environment has forged in the past two years. Based on this understanding, coupled with vigorous implementation, I believe it will surely bring a new look to the war situation. (Our reporter Ding Weidong)

Military, political, and civil servants should especially take on the responsibility of self-governance and self-defense, lead the people, and fight against the bandits. Anyone who is perfunctory or fearful will be punished according to military law. I hope that local people will call on the masses to participate in practical work. The military and political authorities will give their full support. Wealthy merchants should also donate generously, and those found to be aiding the bandits for profit will be treated as one with the bandits. The education sector should work hard in their positions to create a good academic atmosphere, and the cultural sector should uphold justice and promote righteousness, so that we can work together to complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion."

### Fellow Pixian Natives Living Abroad Appeal for Disaster Relief

[Report from our newspaper, Xuzhou, 13th] Pixian is the ancient site of "Xia Pi." Pi is the name of a river, with "Shang Pi" and "Xia Pi." Shang Pi is located in the southwest of Tengxian County and is also a lowland, while Xia Pi is the lowest of the lowlands. Currently, the water south of Mount Tai in Shandong Province all converges in Pi. The water in eastern Shandong flows from the Dayi River southward and enters the Grand Canal at Quewan in Pixian. The water in western Shandong flows southeastward through the Grand Canal, the Bulao River, and the Fangting River and joins in the "Three-Forked River" area of Pixian before flowing east. Therefore, every time the water rises during the rainy season, the Grand Canal cannot accommodate the large amount of water, and it inevitably overflows, causing disaster nine years out of ten. The autumn flood last year was the most severe. The entire territory has become a marsh. In addition, the communist bandits have rebelled, harassed, and destroyed. Food and grass have reached their end. The young and strong of the poor flee to beg for food, while the old and weak rely on tree bark and grass roots to survive at home, their skin yellow and thin, waiting for death. Although there are measures such as emergency relief and work relief, they are a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. The Pixian natives living abroad have organized a disaster relief association, with the general association located in Xuzhou. Branches have been established in Nanjing, Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Beiping to seek assistance widely in order to provide universal relief.

### Taking off his Military Uniform to Start a Business, Weng Zhaoyuan Investigates Timber and Tea in Shenzhou

[Report from our newspaper, Fuzhou, 9th] Weng Zhaoyuan, the famous anti-Japanese general who once distinguished himself in the "Xifengkou" battles of January 28th, removed himself from military duties after the victory and retreated to the countryside, living in seclusion in the Shantou area of Guangdong Province, where he started a business. In the middle of last month, he flew from Shantou to Taiwan and traveled to various parts of Taiwan to inspect transportation, water conservancy, factories, and power departments, using them as a reference for starting a business in Guangdong Province. Along the way, he met with Chairman Wei of Taiwan Province, Vice Chairman Sun of the National Government, and others, and had a cordial conversation. On the 2nd of this month, he flew from Taiwan to Fuzhou with Yang Lianggong, the supervising commissioner of Fujian and Taiwan, and stayed at the Zhongnan Hotel. That evening, the reporter called on him at the hotel. Weng was no longer wearing a military uniform and was dressed in casual Western clothing, and his overcoat was slightly wrinkled. His entire luggage consisted of only two thin quilts and a suitcase. He expressed his delight at the reporter's visit, but first denied that he would be taking on an important position in South China. He said that he had already decided to retire to serve his hometown and did not intend to get involved in politics and the military. In Shantou, he only manages a relief home and receives a small salary. Otherwise, he manages several farms, mines, and paper mills. He intends to expand his plans in the future. This trip to Taiwan was purely for investigation purposes, and his visit to Fujian was to investigate the production and sales of timber and tea in Fuzhou. He said that the Chao-Shan area of eastern Guangdong and the Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen areas of southern Fujian are awash with overseas Chinese capital and should be guided to useful purposes. If the government can provide more effective guarantees, the future is promising. Otherwise, if they are used for extravagance and waste, it will not only be a waste of wealth but also harm the customs and security of the overseas Chinese hometowns. Therefore, he plans to return to Shantou via Fujian and then go to Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and various parts of Southeast Asia to collect some overseas Chinese capital for the needs of returning home for construction.

Weng is now sixty years old, but his spirit is unusually vibrant. He said that fighting is no longer possible, but he still has the energy to engage in business. When the reporter asked about the recent situation of General Cai Tingkai, he replied: They have lost contact with each other for a long time. He only knows that he is also engaged in business in Hong Kong. (Our reporter Huang Chuqing)

### A Cruel Mother-in-Law Kills Her Weak Daughter-in-Law by Strangulation with a Hemp Rope

[Report from Wujin, 14th] A strange death case involving Chu Fengdi once caused a sensation in Nanjing and Shanghai, and the Changzhou Court was destroyed because of it. Unexpectedly, a year later, a similar case of a cruel mother-in-law abusing and killing her weak daughter-in-law occurred in Dongyao Village, Hekou Township, Qishu Yan District. It is truly a coincidence. Sheng Rong-sheng, a resident of Majia Village, Wugang Township, Old Fifth District, is a farmer by trade. He has a daughter named Mei-zhen. The farmer's daughter is quiet by nature, generous and poised, and has the demeanor of a lady from a good family. Several years ago, she married Lu Wen-yu, the Baochang of Dongyao Village, through a matchmaker. The relationship between the young couple was initially harmonious, but there was a mother-in-law and a sister-in-law in the family who were always instigating discord, spreading rumors, and frequently abusing her, resulting in disagreements and quarrels. The family has been troubled ever since. On the morning of the ninth of this month, the young couple quarreled again over some matter. Then, they began struggling with each other. After the neighbors persuaded them to stop, Mei-zhen's husband went to work in the fields after the quarrel. The cruel sister-in-law and fierce mother-in-law suddenly grabbed Mei-zhen and beat her mercilessly, until she was covered in bruises and begged for mercy before they finally spared her. When Mei-zhen's parents learned about this, they felt sorry for their daughter and rushed to the Lu family to take their daughter home to recover. At that time, Lu Wen-yu was in the city on business and did not know about this. When he returned home on the tenth and learned about it, he went to Majia Village in person on the afternoon of the eleventh to take Mei-zhen home. At that time, Mei-zhen insisted on not returning because she could not bear the abuse. After the repeated persuasion of relatives and neighbors, she reluctantly followed her father-in-law home in tears. After arriving home, Wen-yu went out again. Not long after he left, the cruel mother-in-law and fierce sister-in-law once again attacked Mei-zhen and strangled her to death with a hemp rope. After causing the trouble, the sister-in-law immediately fled without a trace, and the mother-in-law also hesitated and disappeared. When Mei-zhen's parents heard the news and rushed to visit, they saw Mei-zhen's body lying supine on the bed, and her death was extremely tragic, with rope marks visible on her neck. After negotiations, they finally placed the body on the bed. Lu Baochang relied on his power to prevent the matter from being expanded. Mei-zhen's parents were also poor and unable to report the matter to the city. The nearby locals were very indignant and were about to raise funds to help the deceased seek justice.

### A Headless Female Corpse; Two Maidservants in Kunming Murdered; The Master is Under Strong Suspicion

[Report from Kunming, 15th] Strange cases have been occurring frequently in Kunming recently. Following the major bloodshed cases of a wife killing her husband, a son killing his father, and a brother killing his sister in the eastern suburbs, a bizarre double-corpse murder case has now occurred in the bustling Xiangyun Street, number 188. Sun Shouren, who recently purchased the land for the house, planned to hire workers to build a large building. While digging ditches and turning over the soil, two headless female corpses were suddenly discovered. After the police bureau was notified, they immediately launched an investigation and examined the corpses. It was determined that they were murdered before death. The former homeowner, Liu Huicang, and the Liu Rongguang couple who rented the house were summoned for questioning. It was learned that one of the female corpses was Xiaoguniang, 13 years old, and the other was Huanzhen, 11 years old, both from Guiyang. The Liu Rongguang couple purchased them last year to work as maidservants. On August 27th of last year, they returned home after watching a play, but there was no response when they called at the door. They broke down the door and entered, and saw the two maidservants lying on the floor, having apparently died from poisoning. At that time, the Liu Rongguang couple claimed that they were too panicked and feared causing trouble, so they hired workers to bury them in the room. The police bureau believed that their confession was evasive and there were too many doubts. Moreover, the Liu couple's behavior was improper and they both had addictions. There must be something hidden in the story. They are intensifying their investigation, and the truth will be revealed soon.

### Hubei Cotton Merchants Petitioning Group Demands the Signing of Cotton Purchase Contracts; Will Remain in Shanghai Long-Term Until Purpose is Achieved

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Hubei Cotton Merchants Petitioning Group, consisting of seven people including Cheng Ziju and Li Yingting, previously requested Chairman Yuan of the Yarn Control Committee in Shanghai to treat them equally, following the example of Shanghai cotton merchants, and requested the government to sign entrusted purchase contracts with Hubei cotton merchants, but to no avail. Therefore, on the 8th of this month, they went to Nanjing to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. They returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday and specially hosted the city's press yesterday to explain that the motivation for the petition was not for their own business and interests, but to support the national policy of unified purchase. While in Nanjing, they voluntarily provided the Ministry of Economic Affairs with a draft of twelve articles on methods for entrusted purchase of cotton, which had four characteristics: (1) All working capital received is guaranteed by cotton of equal value, without using real estate or securities, and without depositing money or drafts. (2) An initial 300,000 dan will be purchased, with 150,000 dan delivered every 45 days. If the full amount is not delivered by the deadline, the cotton merchants are willing to be punished by the government for the shortfall. (3) If the working capital received or the cotton purchased is lost, the cotton merchants will bear all the responsibility themselves. (4) Purchases are limited to production areas, and there will be no competitive bidding or price increases. The Ministry of Economic Affairs forwarded these methods to the Yarn Control Committee for review and ordered the representatives to contact the Yarn Control Committee for handling. After the representatives returned to Shanghai, they contacted the Yarn Control Committee twice, but were unable to meet Chairman Yuan and were instead met by Deputy Director Wang Lan of the Production Committee. It is reported that Wang stated that the committee is drafting comprehensive cotton purchase regulations, so that anyone who complies with the regulations can request the government to entrust them with purchases. He also indicated two methods: (1) The Hubei cotton merchants should directly contact the Shanghai Cotton Merchants Association and transfer a portion of their established entrusted purchase quota to the Hubei cotton merchants. (2) The comprehensive purchase regulations will be released within three days. However, the representatives believed that the first point had technical difficulties and would be impossible to implement. At the same time, they still hoped that Chairman Yuan would provide a written reply to the Hubei cotton merchants' request. Before obtaining a definite solution, the representatives will remain in Shanghai for a long time and strive to the end.

### Tight Credit Conditions, Weak Door Sales, Rice Prices Generally Fall; Flour and Cooking Oil Turn Firm and Rising

[Report from Our Newspaper] Rice prices generally fell yesterday. High-quality goods fell by about 150,000 per dan, while inferior goods fell by 200,000. According to analysis, the main reason for the decline was tight credit conditions, and buyers were unable to take delivery of goods. Door sales were also very weak, so there was a general cry for sale in the market. Yesterday's registered arrivals were 2859 shi in the South City and 7354 shi 5 dou in the North City. The trading price of white geng rice was 3.5 million in the South City and 3.54 million in the North City. The trading price of special geng rice was 3.6 million in the South City and 3.7 million in the North City. The trading price of thin indica rice was 3.45 million in the South City and 3.4 million in the North City. The trading price of early indica rice was 3.3 million in the South City and 3.25 million in the North City.

Another News: The work of coordinating the people's food supply in this city has been actively carried out in recent days. As of the 14th, the People's Coordination Committee had allocated 300,000 shi of rice. The rice shops in the city were generally understanding of the government's policy and cooperated with the People's Coordination Committee. The rice purchased by the citizens was of good quality. All citizens who purchased more than 5 dou of rice were provided with free delivery. Citizens generally praised the convenience.

Flour slightly rose. The market was no longer declining and turned firm and hard because merchants from North China took in low prices. Bingchuan flour opened at 1.44 million, once slightly lower at 1.435 million. In the middle, there was Qingdao gang suction of more than 1,000 bags, and then rose. Finally was 1.445 million.

Miscellaneous grains rose and fell. Soybeans were sold at a tight price because the prices in the production areas such as Hankou were not cheap. Corn prices in Qingdao were fatigued. The market was flat because of the customers' inaction. The market for picked-up Qing was flat and weak. Tianjin gang stopped paying, fell 100,000 yuan, and peanuts also turned tired because Guangdong had no inquiry, and slightly fell 100,000 yuan.

Cooking oil rose slightly, with the most rise for raw oil, because the arrival was long and desolate, the reserve was less rich in bean oil, and the supply quantity was also small. Qingdao Jiyong raw oil opened at 8.2 million, and later rose to 8.3 million. The opening price of Dayou bean oil was 7.1 million, and the closing price was 7.05 million. Rape and sesame oil rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan each. Jiyong small car sesame oil was traded at 8 million yuan. Bean cake initially rose, but later Shantou did not move, so it still fell, and finally rose slightly by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan.

Soap Rises Again

In the daily necessities soap market, the owners of Huangxiangmao set the plate to increase to 4.2 million, the transaction was very smooth. As a result, Guben soap also increased by 200,000, closing at 6 million, Arrow Knife rose by 100,000, Xiangmao rose by 190,000, and Mei Li also rose by 100,000. The others were all tired.

Match trading has become scarce, and the market has seen a slight decline. The kerosene candles market is stable.

### The Atomic Energy Problem and Everyone's Responsibility

— Original by Li Lian Tai Er, Translated by Chen Zhuo Ru

It is a fallacious and entrenched opinion to believe that the atomic energy problem is irrelevant to the general public. Some people say that the problem is too specialized and that laymen cannot understand it; others say that the problem is related to national defense and is dangerous to discuss. Still others say that the problem is simply a mental exercise that is of no practical use, and therefore advocate ignoring it. Furthermore, they argue, since this method of silence was very successful during the war, why should we change course today?

But I believe that this is not correct and that it is dangerous to the ideals cherished by the Chinese people, and therefore harmful to national security.

Atomic energy has not changed the fundamental principles of democracy—which are based on the belief in the wisdom of the people, as long as everyone knows the main facts. This principle and this belief are the legal basis for the creation of the Atomic Energy Commission. If the people want this principle and policy to be effective—that is, if the people themselves want to decide the policies that determine their own future destiny—then this policy must be able to be implemented. The glory of democracy lies in the fact that the common sense judgment of the entire people can determine the course of the nation. Therefore, atomic energy is everyone's business.

What do you think of when you talk about atomic energy? Nine times out of ten, you only think of the atomic bomb. This is natural. This atomic weapon is a reality. I live with it day and night, and although this is unbelievable, it is actually the case. Simply frightening people and making them anxious day and night, suffering from neurosis—this is also not a solution and will ultimately be of no help.

It is a fact that atomic energy produces a weapon of unimaginable destruction. The Atomic Energy Commission is still designing, developing, and manufacturing such a weapon, and we are determined to maintain America's superiority in this area until effective international management can be implemented. This is the basic policy of the Atomic Energy Act passed in 1946—the McMahon Act.

At present, our monopoly on the manufacture of such weapons will not last forever; other countries will also be able to manufacture atomic bombs. Once a war with a large number of atomic bombs occurs, civilization will undoubtedly suffer a great disaster. This is why, in the United Nations, various countries are trying and continue to try to put atomic weapons under effective international control—but these efforts have not yet been successful.

No one—least of all I—underestimates the importance of atomic energy as a weapon. It has fundamentally shaken past political and diplomatic views. These facts are important to every citizen who lives in peace and prosperity, whether he lives in Washington, London, Moscow, or Paris.

But equally important is that atomic energy and the atomic bomb are not synonymous. If the public continues to think so confusedly, it will be difficult to prevent atomic energy from being used as a weapon, and it will be even more difficult for us to obtain the benefits of this great invention.

The atomic bomb is only the first performance of atomic energy, and although these performances are very dramatic, in fact, what we have obtained is not just a weapon. We have also gained a new knowledge of a very great and very universal force, comparable to gravity and electromagnetism.

I believe that no physical thing is more important to human well-being than the sun. We get all our power from the sun—chemical power, the power to create and sustain life, the power to build skyscrapers and temples, and the power to write poems and songs. The light of the sun is the very stuff of life itself.

This seems like a platitude, but it is very relevant to the problem of atomic energy, because the sun, the source of life, is also a huge atomic energy factory. The power emitted by the sun comes from a very common element in the sun.

So the power hidden in the atom is not a rare thing, not new at all. What is new is that today, in our generation, knowledge has increased to such an extent that we are finally close to understanding atomic energy and are about to make it available for human use.

Atomic power is not fully understood even by the greatest scientists today. But there are two very important facts that everyone alive should know.

(1) Humanity knows more about atomic energy in the past thirty years than it did in the previous thousands of years.

(2) In a few more years—perhaps ten years—we will be able to answer so many mysteries of life and matter that it will give us a new concept of life.

We are fortunate to be born in this fragment of history, because the basic knowledge of life is about to be understood by mankind.

New knowledge naturally brings about change. Atomic weapons have changed the relationship between countries, and the problem of how to maintain peace has also changed. Atomic energy has changed the way we treat diseases. At present, radioactive materials—isotopes—are adding to our methods of treating cancer, heart disease, and other diseases (Translator's note: For example, radioactive iodine compounds are used to treat cancer of the thyroid gland, because the thyroid gland absorbs iodine, and the cancer in that area is exposed to radiation, which cures the patient).

These radioactive isotopes, like the first atomic bomb, are produced in large quantities in the same important experimental factory, in the same atomic reactor. The material that is put into the reactor becomes radioactive when it comes out of the reactor, and is similar to radium in some ways, but differs in its quantity and variety.

These radioactive isotopes are now used in medicine. At Vanderbilt University, a certain type of chronic anemia (leukemia) is treated with gold that has been irradiated in the atomic reactor that was originally used for national defense. Memorial Cancer Hospital in New York and other institutions also use radioactive isotopes to treat certain special types of cancer.

It is too early to say that these treatments have some kind of miraculous effect. But in medical and biological research, there is a great deal of well-founded hope in this area in the future. The knowledge gained from this method of the internal workings of the human body and the general biological processes, and the influence of external objects or diseases on the organic tissues of the human body or animals, is all just beginning. This new knowledge will fundamentally affect our future.

The radioactive materials produced at the Oak Ridge atomic energy plant of the Department of Defense are now giving us some clues to the age-old mysteries of life. For example, how does a cornstalk use sunlight to produce food that provides energy? How does a plant absorb fertilizer from the soil, and what kind of process is actually taking place in the plant?

The prospects for new knowledge in agriculture are virtually endless. No area of research holds more hope for human understanding of the basic secrets of nature than the radioactive carbon research currently underway—that is, the secret of photosynthesis. People have never known how plants use carbon dioxide and water to form carbohydrates. There is a mystery here.

(Translator's note: Extremely small amounts of radioactive atoms constitute ordinary compounds, which are ingested by organisms. Because of the presence of radioactivity, we can use a Geiger counter to measure the process of these substances, and thus we can see the entire process of these substances in the organism. This use of radioactive materials is being applied in many ways.)

Some answers may not be so fundamental, but they are still generally hoped for, such as: how to prevent insect pests, protect fruits with insecticides, determine how plants actually use fertilizers, and some related questions, which are all solved by using radioactive isotopes. These issues can greatly affect the world's food supply, and are therefore an important step towards world peace.

It is no exaggeration to say that the entire cost of research on atomic energy—which has cost $250 billion to date—can be compensated for and more than compensated for by the benefits it has brought in agriculture and human nutrition.

This radiation process will have many uses in the future. Ordinary and little-known atoms, after being struck, will open up new worlds in industry. We are now using radioactive steel to study why anti-friction bearings wear out, because we can use radioactive steel to measure the specks of metal that fall off the friction surfaces, as small as one ten-millionth of an ounce. The steelmaking industry can also control the process of sulfur exchange between iron and slag in the steelmaking furnace with great precision, because we are now using radioactive iron and sulfur tracer research.

At the University of Wisconsin, they are using radioactive isotopes produced in the Oak Ridge chain reaction machine to study the surface phenomena of glass and metal. Scientists are beginning to realize that there is a thin, insignificant layer of foreign molecules and ions deposited on the surface of glass and metal. This knowledge enables us to know how to make better mirrors, improve electroplating, and may have great developments for the manufacture of detergents.

Radioactive isotopes are produced in the nuclear reactor, which ordinary people call a pile. (The so-called pile is made of a large pile of graphite—used for pencils—and a layer of uranium. (This pile, from the outside, looks like a warehouse without windows. Inside, if the reaction is taking place, the extremely strong radiation is like several tons of radium radiating. (But in the entire United States, there are only about twenty-five ounces of uranium available). This spontaneous nuclear chain reaction machine does three things here:

(1) It produces plutonium, a new element that can be used for other reactors or weapons.

(2) It produces heat, which one day can be used for motive power.

(3) It produces neutron radiation, an invisible and extremely fast-moving molecule. (To be continued)

### Religious Disputes in India

— Li Ren

Gandhi's death was due to political reasons, but also to religious reasons. The political struggle in India is essentially a religious struggle. In the history of religious struggles, there have been countless bloody events. If Gandhi's death is seen as the death of a martyr, it still cannot express Gandhi's greatness. Gandhi's greatness lies in his ability to go beyond religious disputes and seek to resolve them.

However, Gandhi ultimately failed to resolve the religious disputes in India. What is the reason for this? This is what the author wants to briefly explain here. From a historical point of view, religious disputes are a type of dispute that cannot be resolved. The reasons why they cannot be resolved are twofold: first, the nature of religion in general, and second, the characteristics of religion in India. By briefly explaining these two points, we can have a clearer understanding of religious disputes in India.

Religion is based on emotion, and its goal is to seek comfort for human emotions. The reason why humans need religion, or the reason why religion arises, is because human emotions are uneasy, especially when it comes to matters of life and death, they feel confused. Because of this unease, humans have a need for religion. In a state of everything going well, and the will and emotions being pleased, religion seems unnecessary. When humans need religion, there must be a problem with their emotions. Therefore, they either do not believe in religion, or if they do believe, their emotions are particularly strong. All the rituals of religion are mostly designed to arouse human emotions, and its doctrines are mostly designed to satisfy human emotions. Ordinary emotions tend to arise and disappear quickly, lacking continuity, but religious emotions are often continuous and not easily disappear. At the same time, religious emotions are also stronger than any other emotion. Therefore, the struggle between religions is a struggle between emotions. This kind of struggle is often not something that reason can resolve. This is because only reason can obey reason, but emotions are not easy to obey reason. This kind of struggle is also often not something that another emotion can resolve. Emotions may obey the same emotion, but they are not easy to obey different emotions. This can be said to be one reason why Gandhi was unable to resolve the religious disputes in India.

Secondly, the religious disputes in India are disputes between Islam and Hinduism and Buddhism. According to Northrop, human religions can be divided into two major categories: one category is theistic religions, and the other category is non-theistic religions. Christianity, Islam, etc. belong to the former category, while Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism belong to the latter category. The former category of religions, that is, theistic religions, are characterized by: all being aggressive, all having a missionary zeal, and all regarding other religions as heretical, wrong, and inferior. They all regard their doctrines as absolutely perfect, and their followers are divinely mandated to replace other religions with the "only perfect religion." Therefore, this type of religion is narrow-minded, intolerant, and extremely difficult to cooperate with other religions. Conversely, the latter category of religions, that is, non-theistic religions, do not have aggressiveness, lack missionary zeal, and are more able to respect other religions. This type of religion is open-minded, broad-minded, and easier to cooperate with other religions. The fact that Buddhism and Christianity did not cause serious disputes when they came to China is because China's own religions are non-theistic. However, the religions of India itself, such as Islam, are theistic, and their followers have a considerable number and a considerable strength, so it is extremely difficult to get them to cooperate with India and other religions. In this way, the partition of India and Pakistan was inevitable, and Gandhi's failure was also inevitable.

### The Union of Aesthetic Objects and Emotions

— Han Yuwen

Aesthetic emotion is emotion towards an object, and at the same time, an aesthetic object is the concrete expression of aesthetic emotion. Therefore, aesthetic emotion and aesthetic objects have a unified relationship.

According to common sense, emotion is subjective and the object is objective, so how can the two be united? Some people think that the emotions of the aesthete arise from changes in the muscles of the aesthete, and that the emotion in the object is transferred from the emotion of the aesthete to the object. For example, Vernon Lee said, when you see a mountain on the horizon, you feel that the mountain is rising from the ground. This concept of rising is full of associations of life, energy, and courage. So when you see that mountain, you have emotion for it and think it has a certain character. The reason why you think this way is because when you look up at that high mountain, you have a rising emotion due to your looking up and other muscle movements, so you unconsciously use this emotion and the meaning you imagine in this situation to describe that mountain, so you feel that the mountain has emotion. This is the case for mountains and other objects as well. When you quietly observe an object, especially when you quietly observe a system of lines and patterns, you always have corresponding tension or movement in your body for the form of that object: rising or falling, advancing or intersecting, or obstructing each other. These situations are the materials you use to construct your object and its emotions.

Vernon Lee also has a similar example. He said, here is an ordinary ceramic vase. When you see it, you have a special overall feeling for it. First, your feet are on the ground and your eyes are fixed on the bottom of the vase. Then you pick up the vase, while straightening your body, and the symmetrical sides of the vase make both your left and right lungs move together with them. As your eyes move from the bottom of the vase along the curve of the vase's outline to the mouth of the vase, you will have to inhale into your stomach. This situation is as if we were going to make a vase ourselves in order to immerse ourselves in it and unite with it.

This explanation of the union of emotion and object is indeed very vivid and moving, but Bosanquet believes that, first, this theory places too much emphasis on the status of lines and patterns. Although patterns are a preliminary symbol for us to recognize forms, it is a big misunderstanding to think that spatial patterns are aesthetic forms. What's more, lines and patterns are no more able to express aesthetic forms than colors and tones. The depth and contrast of colors and the harmony of tones are just as much aesthetic forms as the patterns in space and the rhythm in time; the latter is no more superior to the former. Second, the tension and movement in our bodies caused by lines and patterns are not the same for everyone. And our actual imagination or perception does not need the help of these details. In fact, these details hinder our imagination and perception.

Mitchell also has an example. He said that when we enjoy an elegant curve, our eyes move along that curve. Our pleasure is felt in this movement of the eyes, and at the same time we transfer our pleasure to the nature of our object in this situation. But Bosanquet believes that things are not that simple. When we appreciate a curve, our eyes do move along that curve, but the muscles of the eyes are only a sensory moving machine, and that curve is not only a sensory object, but also a perceptual object; the character that our imagination gives to that curve undoubtedly comes from our entire experience, and we have no reason to say that it comes from the movement of the eyes. In order for our pleasant emotion to become a characteristic of the object, we must of course live in the details of that object, but to reach this point, we must have a complete imagination. That is to say, the union of emotion and object is the result of the entire aesthetic imagination, not the result of muscle activity. The emotion in the object certainly has its subjectivity, but it also has its objectivity. In fact, we see interest in the object in the same way that we see colors and patterns in the object and hear sounds in the same way. Therefore, how we attribute emotion to the object is the same as how we attribute colors, sounds, and patterns to the object, and there is no need for two different theories to explain.

### On Learning and Skill

— Shao Xiong

The meaning of the two words "learning" and "skill" indicates a major truth, that is, equal emphasis on theory and practice, or equal emphasis on knowledge and action. "Learning" is to clarify the principles, which is a matter of theory, that is, a matter of knowledge. "Skill" is to realize the principles, or apply the principles, which is a matter of practice, that is, a matter of action. It is not acceptable to have learning without skill, and it is even more unacceptable to have skill without learning. Learning and skill cannot be separated; separation will lead to mutual harm and nothing will be accomplished.

The difference between Chinese and Western cultures can be seen from the separation or non-separation of learning and skill. Generally speaking, Western culture is a culture that does not separate learning and skill, and places equal emphasis on learning and skill. The Greeks had brilliant achievements in the area of learning. The Greeks emphasized investigating principles and seeking knowledge for the sake of knowledge, so they created many intellectual systems in the theoretical aspect. The contributions of the Greeks cannot be ignored for the Western culture of today. However, the contributions of the Greeks seem to be limited to learning and have not yet reached the level of skill. The Greeks did not fully link learning and skill. Their learning still relied on speculation and lacked experimentation, and as a result, their learning was limited and could not make long-term progress. Therefore, although the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle controlled the entire Middle Ages, the Middle Ages still made very few contributions in the area of learning. It was not until the Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution that Westerners realized the connection between learning and skill, and realized that they should closely link learning and skill. On the one hand, they emphasized learning, emphasizing the exploration of pure theory; on the other hand, they also emphasized skill, emphasizing practical application. When there were new discoveries in the theoretical aspect, there were immediately new applications in the practical aspect. Learning inspires skill, enabling skill to gain new ways of application from the inspiration of theory. Skill verifies or negates learning, enabling learning to gain ways of progress from the success or difficulty in practice. Therefore, if there is skill without learning, skill will be limited to a mere craft and cannot have new discoveries. If there is learning without skill, learning will be limited to empty theory and cannot have new progress. To promote the common progress of learning and skill, skill must be supplemented by learning, and learning must also be supplemented by skill. The main secret of the progress of Western culture in the past century lies in this.

Conversely, the main reason why Chinese culture has stagnated and cannot progress is because Chinese culture is a culture in which learning and skill are separated. On the one hand, Chinese culture seems to emphasize learning, and on the other hand, it seems to emphasize skill. It is naturally not very accurate to say that Chinese culture emphasizes learning. But it is also not very accurate to say that Chinese culture emphasizes skill. In fact, Chinese culture has learning, but learning cannot be supplemented by skill, and it has skill, but skill cannot be supplemented by learning. People who talk about learning still engage in empty talk, emphasizing speculation, and their speculation is like a horse without reins, uncontrolled by methods, unconstrained by facts, and as a result, they are mostly mired in fantasy. Therefore, even in the area of learning, China cannot surpass the West. This is the drawback of having learning without skill. In the area of skill, China has indeed made amazing contributions in the past. For example, the three major inventions of the compass, gunpowder, and printing are things that the Chinese can be proud of. However, they stopped there, and now the progress of these inventions is in the West and not in China. The reason is that Chinese skill is mostly not supplemented by learning. Although there is such and such a skill, there is no such and such a learning. Skill does not advance to learning, so skill is stagnant and never progresses. This is the drawback of having skill without learning. Therefore, Chinese culture has become a culture that either has learning without skill, or has skill without learning, and learning and skill are always separated. When learning and skill are separated, learning does not progress, and skill also stops at what it already has.

From this, one way out for Chinese culture is to closely link learning and skill. We cannot emphasize learning without emphasizing skill, and even more so, we cannot emphasize skill without emphasizing learning. Only when learning and skill are united can we produce true "learning and skill."

### Scholarly Jottings (Thirteen)

— Zhang Qiyun

Contemporary European and American Thought (Part 1)

Professor R. M. Roxby of England once stated that the Three Principles of the People is a synthesis of Eastern and Western thought, integrating China's inherent traditions with the thoughts and experiences of Europe and America from the 19th to the early 20th centuries. This is a very fair observation. To fully understand the Three Principles of the People, we should consider the entire world of scholarship and culture as its background. This article, based on Bertrand Russell's new book, "A History of Western Philosophy" (published in October 1944), categorizes modern European and American thought into eight major schools, providing a brief introduction as a reference for comparison. This may lead to a deeper understanding of the ideals of the Three Principles of the People.

(1) Liberalism: Liberalism and the British Empiricist school share a common origin. John Locke (1632-1704) was the pioneer of Empiricism in epistemology and the forerunner of Liberalism in political philosophy. Anyone in modern Western society who discusses democratic politics invariably admires Locke. His theories laid the foundation for British democracy and sparked the American and French Revolutions, with profound and far-reaching influence. Locke's method of thinking was experimental and tentative, accumulating knowledge bit by bit, like scientific work. He believed that politics should be governed by reason, emphasizing evidence and discussion, not respecting authority, not being dogmatic, and believing in gradual reform. The English Revolution of 1688 (the 27th year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty) was the most moderate and successful revolution, largely due to Locke's advocacy. In his book "Two Treatises of Government" (published in two volumes in 1689 and 1690), he fully elaborated on the spirit of the English Revolution. It attacked the monarchy,贬斥hereditary power, advocated freedom of speech, and holds an extremely important position in political thought. During the period of civil strife in England, the conflict between the royal family and the parliament was evenly matched, fostering a mentality of reconciliation and compromise, avoiding extremes. This national character has persisted to this day. Locke believed that to change another person's beliefs, one must patiently persuade and gently guide, not immediately denounce others as stubborn or even oppress them. Anyone with a humble desire to learn will not want to force others to agree with them. He also said that in believing in truth, we cannot help but have some skepticism. This sentiment is related to religious tolerance and is the essence of British parliamentary politics. The liberal approach laid the foundation for long-term peace and stability in Britain. The principle of separation of powers and checks and balances created by Locke in "Two Treatises of Government" is the mainstream of modern democratic thought, especially in the United States, where it has been most fully implemented. The American president, Congress, and Supreme Court have established the dignity of the separation of powers. When conflicts arise between the powers of the president and Congress, Locke's theories are often adopted as a guideline. There has only been one instance of armed conflict in American history. Russell is most enthusiastic about Locke's theories, believing that to hope for world peace, totalitarian thinking must be abandoned. If a world government is established in the future, the system of separation of powers can still be applied. However, Liberalism is not without flaws. The early liberals, represented by English Protestants, were rich in common people's colors, but the concept of property often occupied an important position. Locke's theory of democracy was based on private property. The English Revolution of 1688 was originally a triangular relationship between the British aristocracy and the middle class (great merchants and wealthy businessmen) united against the monarch. After Locke, liberals represented the emerging industrial and commercial sectors in England. They opposed the monarch and the aristocracy, but not landlords and capitalists, so Liberalism had a relationship with capitalism. Russell criticized capitalism, saying: "Political power cannot be hereditary, so why can economic power be hereditary? The principle of inheritance has been abolished in the political sphere, but it is still regarded as natural in the economic sphere. Political dynasties have passed, but economic dynasties still exist." This is an extremely insightful argument, pointing out the shortcomings of Liberalism.

(2) Romanticism: Romanticism opposes Liberalism. The theories of the Frenchman Rousseau (1712-1778) appealed to emotions, directly addressing people's hearts, and were the pioneers of the Romantic movement. This school disliked early industrial civilization, containing anti-scientific and anti-rational colors. The Englishman Byron (1788-1824) was a romantic poet, and Carlyle (1795-1881) advocated the worship of heroes. Due to the promotion of writing, its momentum gradually increased. In the early 19th century, Germany was not yet unified. German historiography, centered on Prussia, advocated nationalism. Fichte (1762-1814) and Hegel (1770-1831) sang praises to the national soul and were spokespersons for Prussia. Bismarck completed the great cause of German unification. When nationalism becomes extreme, it becomes national supremacy, which is ideologically in tune with hero worship. As for the establishment of the academic foundation of Romanticism, it relies on the Germans Schopenhauer (1762-1814) and Nietzsche (1844-1900). This school of philosophy emphasizes will, worships power, is emotionally impulsive, and reaches a state of fanaticism. It is also influenced by Darwin's theory, advocating unrestricted competition, regarding war as heroic, and considering the idea of peace as unworthy of respect. From the second half of the 18th century to the present, literature, art, philosophy, and even politics have directly accepted the influence of the Romantic movement. Its momentum is unstoppable. The ultimate problem is Nazism and Fascism, which advocate totalitarian politics domestically and an aggressive policy externally. Because the Romantic school regards national interests as the highest law, dictators can use it to attach themselves to representing public opinion. The Romantic school entrusts power to a few individuals in a few ethnic groups, not hesitating to use violence to achieve this goal. Therefore, all power struggles and hegemony, and aggressive wars are inevitable. The biggest difference between Romanticism and Liberalism is its emphasis on emotion and tendency towards extremes. Russell believes that emotions are superficial and easily aroused, while reason is profound and difficult to achieve. Emotions are independent, while reason must be shared with others. Emotions only care about the present, while reason must consider the future. Humans cannot live in isolation from the world. If they want to be good to others, they cannot focus solely on emotions. Rousseau is the father of the Romantic movement. From today's perspective, Rousseau's theory seems to advocate democracy, but in reality, it is often enough to support totalitarian states. Russell particularly criticized Nietzsche and his ilk, saying that in Nietzsche's view, Lincoln was humble and Napoleon was great. In their minds, there is only universal hatred and fear, without universal sympathy and love. They only think about pain, wanting to put others to death, despising the virtue of benevolence, and not believing in this real world that is the foundation. Nietzsche's theory can be said to be a dead end, and the downfall of Nazi Germany is clear evidence of this. Russell considers Hitler to be a descendant of Rousseau, and Roosevelt and Churchill to be successors of Locke. The Locke school is accustomed to human relationships and worldly affairs, with many fair and sensible people, valuing reason, valuing experimentation, and valuing discussion. They have made more efforts to improve human welfare. The Romantic school only values the country, not the people, praising heroes and shouting for sacrifice, gradually becoming the culprit of world wars. The ideological differences between these two schools are clear and cannot be equated.

### Rickshaw Drivers Demand Customs Gold, Don't Be Fooled When Taking a Ride

A Reader Urges the Bureau to Prohibit It

Recently, it has been reported that rickshaw drivers and tricycle drivers at the city's ferry terminals have been demanding prices from passengers based on the face value of customs gold notes. This has also been heard of in the city in recent days. Passengers who are greedy for petty gains and those who do not often come to Shanghai often argue upon arrival at their destination, each insisting on their own version. Yesterday afternoon around 6 p.m., I personally witnessed a tricycle driver demanding 8,000 yuan from a passenger (who seemed to be a villager) on Yunnan Road and Guangdong Road (without specifying customs gold). The destination was Xiaobeimen. Such a journey, calculated at 8,000 yuan in customs gold, feels unacceptably expensive, because 8,000 yuan in customs gold is equivalent to 160,000 yuan in legal tender. However, such behavior borders on deception and should be prohibited by the authorities. Your newspaper is the mouthpiece of the people. Could you spare a corner to expose it! Pan Junshan, December.

### Production Justice

— Wu Yong

If a person takes something from another person, they must pay a corresponding price. If we need to enjoy ourselves, we should naturally exchange it for work. This is a truth as immutable as the heavens and the earth. Because taking things from others without paying a price, or only knowing how to enjoy and not knowing how to work, indicates an uneven distribution of happiness and suffering in society. On the one hand, there is too much enjoyment, and on the other hand, the burden is too heavy. We must know that what I gain is what others lose.

As the saying goes: "No merit, no reward." But if we just close our eyes and think, we can know that there are many people in society who receive too many rewards, and the merit they contribute is disproportionate to the rewards they receive. But if we think about what we eat, wear, and live in, which one is not taken from others? However, what exactly have we contributed to the society from which we take? Thinking about it this way, some people in society really should be ashamed to death.

Some may say that what one eats, wears, and lives in is naturally obtained by paying the price of money. People are not willing to let you eat, wear, and live for free, are they? However, we have to ask further: How did you get your money? If it is obtained through cunning or plunder, such as using hoarding methods or speculative means, then such an acquisition can only be called "unearned income." Such a price is not what I call a contribution to society. Because hoarding goods and speculation can indeed be profitable, or even obtain great profits. It may even be the only way to obtain great profits under the current circumstances. However, the profits they obtain are ultimately exploited from people who do not hoard or speculate.

We should know that the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the houses we live in are not dropped from the sky, but are produced and manufactured by people. Therefore, we must also engage in production and manufacturing, and then we can repay the price of what we eat, wear, and live in. Zhu Zi's Family Instructions: "Every thread and every strand should know that material resources are difficult to obtain. Every porridge and every meal should think that the source is not easy to come by." This teaches people to be frugal. Most people in society take more from society than they contribute to it. How can we waste it again? However, this point only focuses on the negative aspect of saving materials. From a positive perspective, we really should engage in production. The amount of production should at least be enough to offset our own consumption. The so-called "rice bug" and "clothes rack" in common sayings, as I see it, refer to those who only know how to consume and do not engage in production.

But what is production? How can we truly contribute to society? It is not easy to define this point. Farmers work hard to produce grains for us, which is of course real production. Merchants transport goods from one place with surplus to another place with shortage, so that the economy can be adjusted, which can also be regarded as a contribution to society. As for factory employees turning raw materials into finished products, turning things that originally did not have a clear effect into goods that can have an effect, this is of course also a form of production.

Accordingly, although it is not easy to define "production" and "contribution," it is not impossible to find a standard for "production" and "non-production" or "contribution" and "non-contribution." In my opinion, anything that is beneficial to living beings, we make it from "nothing" to "something." This is production. Anything that is truly beneficial to the public, we can call it a "contribution." For example, building a house is making something beneficial to living beings from "nothing" to "something," which is truly beneficial to people. This is "production." If we destroy an original good house, regardless of the purpose, to put it mildly, the crime of not being frugal is always difficult to escape, right?

According to this standard, to be honest, many of today's so-called employed people are not worthy of being called "producers." Checking today's environment, it is really not conducive to production. So many people go to engage in hoarding and speculation. There are many companies and firms that, in reality, are just hoarding and speculation agencies. These types of companies and firms hire managers and partners. They naturally work every day and receive salaries every month. But how can they be called "producers"?

The true so-called production does not refer to "usury" accumulating private wealth. We must know that "making money" and "production" are not necessarily the same thing, just as frugality does not refer to saving money but saving materials. Production should be the production of materials, not the production of money.

### Mickey Mouse Birthday Celebration

—

Since Walt Disney created "Mickey Mouse," it has become a household name. People all over the world know Mickey Mouse.

Last October was Mickey Mouse's double tenth anniversary. More than a thousand people celebrated in a hotel in New York to celebrate Mickey Mouse's birthday. Moreover, congratulatory letters and telegrams poured in from celebrities all over the world to celebrate Mickey Mouse's birthday.

American old statesman Bernard Baruch wrote a letter saying: "Every time I see a Mickey Mouse movie, I feel great relaxation and laughter."

Canadian Prime Minister King wrote: "I am extremely willing to participate in this celebration, because Mickey Mouse gives great joy to men, women, old, and young all over the world."

South African Union Prime Minister General Smuts congratulated him and said: "Regardless of age, we all congratulate Walt Disney. May this father of Mickey Mouse continue to give joy to hundreds of millions of children in various countries."

British Deputy Prime Minister Morrison said: "Walt Disney has given me true happiness."

This banquet celebrating Mickey Mouse's 20th anniversary was hosted by a press club. They also awarded the first "Best Illustration or Work in a Newspaper Award" to Walt Disney.

### "Legend"

— Nian Hong

Our country has always believed in the philosophy of "softness overcomes hardness" for thousands of years. It is important not to be too ostentatious in everything. It is best to be smooth in dealing with the world. This is how things should be done, and so should speaking. As the saying goes: "Gossip only comes from too much talking." Disaster comes from the mouth. So in any case, it is best to say as little as possible. Even when it is absolutely necessary to speak, it is important to say things that are flattering to both sides, irrelevant, and ambiguous. This is the art of speaking. As for authenticity and whether words match actions, these are secondary conditions, optional, and do not need to be paid close attention to.

According to the principles of physics, smooth things have the least friction. The same is true for things in general. Being able to be round means there is no danger of hitting a wall. Especially on a path full of thorns, being square-headed is inevitable to break the skin and wash with blood. After being rounded, it can be smooth all the way. It is said that when a fire breaks out, the safest way for people trapped in fur coats is to roll out. Only being round can roll, so they can enter and exit danger without losing a hair. To make speaking achieve a round level, based on my experience, I think the most convenient and simple way is to prefix it with the words "legend."

Among the tens of millions of words, the words "legend" are the most wonderful. A sentence with "legend" added is transformed into three parts mystery, three parts doubt, three parts truth, and one part temptation. If what is said is correct, it is a great way to boast about oneself. If there is a mistake, it doesn't matter. "Gossip heard on the road is not credible." It will never bring disaster to oneself or have any danger of "losing the country."

What's more, the power of "legend" is extremely great. Even if a few "legends" are completely groundless, the listeners cannot help but believe half of it. Therefore, the trend of "legend" is very popular, and over time, it has become a fashion habit. Of course, "legend" also has many aliases and nicknames, such as "it seems," "maybe," "I'm afraid," "big," "possible," "as if," "good to do," "almost," and the like, all of which are two in one and one in two.

Unfortunately, this set of magic weapons has been overused, which inevitably reduces its effectiveness. Just like round wheels, they inevitably become rough after being used for a long time. Although words are all wearing the hat of "legend," unfortunately people's ability to distinguish has increased relatively. So in the end, the real is real, and the fake is fake, and they still reveal their true colors, making it difficult to pass off fish eyes as pearls.

### Shrimp

— Chen Xiang

Don't underestimate the shrimp that bends its waist. It causes US$60 million in commercial transactions for mankind every year! Moreover, his family is still one of the most prosperous in the ocean world.

A shrimp's life from birth to death is only one year, but a female shrimp can lay 500,000 eggs in her lifetime. However, on average, 499,998 of them will die young, and only two will be able to enjoy their natural life span. Even so, shrimp are still a large group in the sea and also breed in fresh water, which is much stronger than most saltwater animals in adapting to the environment.

There are many types of shrimp, small ones as thin as a hair, and large ones weighing a pound. Saltwater shrimp in the embryonic stage can even survive in liquid air with a temperature as low as minus 190 degrees Celsius. One species can even climb trees.

A few years ago, families in the suburbs of New Orleans, USA, suffered from a large number of unknown small creatures. They made crackling sounds on the floor, and housewives thought fleas had come. Later, after analysis by biologists, they realized that these jumping and bouncing small animals were originally a kind of shrimp.

The oceans all over the world are full of leisure. This phenomenon was of great value to General Adolphus Greely's Arctic expedition in 1880. The expedition prepared enough food for two years. Unfortunately, they were trapped in the icy Arctic for three years due to getting lost. During the period of food shortage, they maintained their lives by catching small shrimp. After eating small shrimp for a year, Winfield, who later won fame in the Spanish-American War. Schley commanded the expedition out of the predicament, but eighteen of the twenty-five members had starved to death; the remaining seven people would probably have turned into frozen bones long ago if they had not been saved by small shrimp.

### Books

— Jin Lin

A room without books is like a body deprived of its spirit. - Cicero.

A book often contains many errors, but it is still a very interesting book; a book sometimes cannot find a single fallacy, but it is still a dull and meaningless book. - Goldsmith

There must first be good readers, then there can be good books. - Emerson

A book that is read carelessly will not give you any benefit. - Ancient Roman proverb

Among the many things created by mankind, the most important, the most precious, and the most valuable are books. - Gorky

A good book is a treasure house of a great soul's precious heart and blood; its purpose is to leave it to posterity. - Milton

A family without books is like a room without windows. - Johnson

### Records of Pingshui

— Shi Shufan

Pingshui is located at the foot of Mount Xianglu. It is surrounded by lush forests, with three-tenths of level land. It is close to the Mingdong Cave and remotely connected to the Six Mausoleums of the Song Dynasty. The clouds and water are clear and rich, and it is truly the crown of the seven counties of Shaoxing. It also produces a lot of tea, cultivating water and picking smoke, and the people's strength is also abundant. In the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic of China, I spent three nights there, mourning the former residence of the poet Jin Hushu Liu Dabai, cherishing incense and fire, and lingering endlessly. Dabai had no descendants. [Editor's note: Dabai's son, Bingzhen, was my Qinghua classmate, and was especially close to my younger brother. Unexpectedly, he committed suicide on the Ping-Sui Railway around the 25th and 26th years of the Republic of China, and his death was very tragic. On the eve of his death, he visited his friends to bid farewell. Many of them did not know that he had already conceived the will to die. Now I see Mr. Shi's four words, and I can't help but feel sad!] His nephew, Yipo, inherited the sacrifice, and recounted the stories of his ancestors in great detail. Moreover, it is said that the ancestors' original surname was Jin, and Liu was his mother's family. Then the guide led me to what was called the White House, a building facing the stream, where the spirit of poetry seemed to be present. In Kuncun, there are the Shousheng Temple, the Yunmen Temple, and the Pingyang Temple. Some of them have secluded structures, hidden deep in the pine trees, or have clear Dharma drums, and store many treasures from previous generations. At that time, talking about the moon on the futon was a joyful experience that made me forget to return. After the war, I went to the White House again, but the owner could no longer be seen. As for the Shousheng Temple Yile, they have changed their clothes and gone to famous places. Others, such as the ancient temple of Pingyang, have also had its halls collapsed and Buddhas destroyed, with green grass growing wildly. Looking for Qian Muzhai's inscription on the pagoda and Li Chunke's couplets, they are all blurred and broken, and there is no way to identify them. Only the dragon inscription of the Thousand Buddhas Nayi, which was bestowed by Emperor Shizu of the Qing Dynasty, is still stored as before. One catastrophe of war dust has changed the world. How can we be happy!

Mourning the Poetry House of the White House

I used to mourn in Zhu Lane, Dabai and Hu'an, Clear tears melt into ink, Dry frost has not risen on the beard, Even now the mountain is also sick, What can I bear when facing this? A stream of water suspects a poetic dream, Still called White House South.

Shousheng Zen Temple

Three autumn yellow leaves road, A cup of purple lotus lamp, The shadow of us ends, The soldiers tear the ancient rope, The barren fields are full of lying tigers, Wild temples do not return monks, I regret the thick flying ashes, The bright moon decreases and increases by itself.

Elegy to Pingyang Temple

The lamp of fireless temple gate is cold, The Buddha turns into spring mud and the waste altar is green, After the chaos, the double eyes are tenderly opened and closed, Peach blossoms, red beans, ink are all gone.

Planting tea when rice leaves are sparse? The stone is thin like a monk, and the grass becomes fat. The ancient embroidery in the deep palace is three hundred years old, Come and put on the residual photo and reflect the moss clothes.

Staying at Xikeng

The mountain shop in the evening cuts off the lights, Pear blossoms beside the water replace the moonlight, How many times can such a soul be sold? The wind and beard fall more on the traveler's frost.

Viewing Yao Futang's Ink Plum Blossoms

Two or three hat shadows fell into the yellow water, The evening wind blows into the ancient ancestral hall, The old plum blossoms come from the hands of the spirit, The paper can bloom a zhang long.

### Flying Hospital

— Mao Yi

In the sawtooth foothills of the Black Hills in South Dakota, USA, lies a bustling, modern little city called Rapid City, with a population of 14,000. Among them is the renowned Dr. Flad Minty—the "Badlands" flying doctor in American anecdotal history. In 1907, when Minty began his medical practice, even the name "telephone" had not been heard of in the mountain areas. Sometimes, suburban residents had to travel a hundred miles to ask for a doctor, a round trip of two hundred miles, requiring a full day of urging the horse onward. If the illness wasn't too severe, there might still be hope, otherwise, the doctor's return trip would inevitably be in vain. Transporting the patient by train for treatment, not to mention the delay, the jolting along the way would be enough to shorten the patient's life.

Witnessing this situation, Minty resolved to bring blessings to the sick. In 1913, he bought his first airplane, simply hiring a pilot to transport it from the airfield to his hometown, which cost him $2,500. However, this early-stage aircraft, before being formally used, was destroyed in its first landing.

By 1927, Minty recognized that the efficiency of airplanes had improved, so he bought a small plane. At that time, he couldn't fly himself, so he hired a pilot. With the plane, he could reach the homes of patients furthest from the hospital within an hour.

However, the small plane had many shortcomings. First, because the entire fuselage was open-air, it was not suitable for South Dakota's severe winter climate. Second, the load capacity was too small. Once, he wanted to load a fat patient weighing two hundred pounds onto the plane, but the small plane built for two people was too heavy to fly. After this lesson, Minty decided to learn to fly. He truly became a pilot.

Now, Minty has three planes. The newest one is a four-seater, equipped like a flying ambulance, with a stretcher and emergency hospital equipment. He brings medical skills and comfort to families living hundreds of miles from the nearest hospital.

An eighteen-month-old child accidentally swallowed a nail, and his parents urgently telegraphed Dr. Minty for help. Minty flew in, took the sick child and his father back to the hospital. Meanwhile, the worried mother drove to the hospital to find out what was happening. When she arrived at the hospital, Minty had already performed the emergency procedure, and the little patient was resting.

No patient has ever refused to fly, and there has never been a plane crash, although there have been many flights with narrow escapes.

Once, Dr. Minty received an urgent telegram from a family living on top of a steep plateau a hundred miles away. The wind was fierce on the plateau, and they hung a white sheet on the clothesline to indicate the wind direction, allowing the doctor to land safely.

After the patient was examined and loaded onto the plane, the wind became stronger, and the plane had to take off within five hundred feet, otherwise, there would be a danger of crashing into the rocks. Several young, strong shepherds held onto the tail of the plane until the engine reached its maximum speed before letting go.

The plane roared across the field, coming to the edge of the towering cliff. But the engine had not yet reached take-off speed, and it was too late to stop. Minty calmly crossed the edge of the cliff, making the plane plunge down the steep slope close to the ground. When the fuselage seemed only an inch away from the sharp rocks below, the engine finally reached its maximum power, and the plane turned and ascended. In this critical moment, the patient prayed incessantly, and once out of danger, he sighed and said, "Okay, God, I don't need you anymore."

### The Vast World

— Le

The country with the most telephones in the world is the United States, with an average of one telephone for every five people. Next is the United Kingdom, with one telephone for every twelve people. Telephones are also common in Sweden, with one telephone for every six people, but the total number is less than in the United Kingdom.

In the state of Utah in the United States, prisoners sentenced to death can choose their own method of death—hanging or shooting.

### The Tramp's Post Office

— Lei Hong

There is a Raymer's Bookshop on Third Street in Washington that also operates a mailbox business. Strange geographical names and special requests are very common at Raymer's Bookshop. For example, a customer of Raymer's Bookshop moved from Long Meadow, Massachusetts, to Coquilhatville, Congo, which is not surprising to them. One customer may go away for a period of time, and upon returning to Raymer's Bookshop to collect the accumulated mail, may need a car to carry it back. Another customer has been coming to the bookstore for twenty-five years, but has never received a letter addressed to Raymer's Bookshop.

The original owner of the bookstore was named Raymer, who first started the mailbox service and passed away several years ago. The successor is Mr. Cherson, who continues to run the mail collection service as before. Today, the business has expanded to 600 customers, who pay three dollars a year, leave a permanent address, and pick up their mail at the store themselves. However, requests for the bookstore to deliver mail to their homes can also be accommodated. Some people often change their addresses, making it difficult for regular mail to be delivered, so they have to use a bookstore mailbox. Some people do not have a fixed household, or do not want to give their real address to friends or enemies, so they use a bookstore mailbox. Cherson has a contract with the post office to be responsible for the mail, but keeps the address absolutely confidential, only revealing it when federal detectives occasionally come to inquire.

Mr. Raymer started this service in 1909, entirely by chance. At that time, a tramp asked Raymer if he could use the bookstore as a mailing address. Raymer agreed, and that was the beginning of the mailbox service. Later, the number of people requesting the bookstore as a mailbox continued to increase, so fees were charged as a restriction, with an annual fee of two US dollars. Currently, there are 600 mailboxes rented in the bookstore, with 400 empty boxes waiting for new customers to rent. Mail can be collected directly by customers, but it can also be forwarded to any location in the world where the customer is located.

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Fleeting Romance (99)

Generally speaking, when a woman is under great stress, if someone can express sympathy and console her emotional pain, it's easy to regard that person as a confidant. In the hospital, surrounded by boredom, loneliness, and depression, Island Cloud took advantage of the situation and captured Qi Wan's heart. At this moment, she only felt that Island Cloud was handsome, gentle, affectionate, enthusiastic, and a promising young man. Moreover, their professions were on the same path. Marrying him, she could either become a celebrity or remain a wealthy merchant's young wife. The future was bright, especially for her current situation, which was very beneficial. At this time, Qi Wan only thought about the positive aspects and did not consider anything else. She was pondering in her heart, and before long, Island Cloud pushed the door open and entered. This time, he had taken off his pajamas and put on a neat suit. His hair was also combed very smoothly. He walked to the bedside and said, "Please forgive me, my heart is like fire. This half hour seems like half a year. I couldn't resist and came in again. I hope Miss Gu will give me a very satisfactory answer." As he spoke, he lowered his head and looked at Qi Wan's face on the bed. She closed her eyes briefly, then opened them again, glanced at Island Cloud, smiled slightly, and closed them again. Island Cloud knew that she had agreed. He was very experienced in this, so without hesitation, he leaned down, put his hands on Qi Wan's shoulders, and kissed her on the face. Qi Wan opened her eyes and said, "You're so clingy, you've made my heart very confused!" Island Cloud saw that the great task had been accomplished, and smiled slightly with great satisfaction: "Now we need to discuss the wedding. Should we get married in Beiping or go to Shanghai?" Qi Wan moved her eyes, concentrated for a moment, and said, "I think it would be best to go to Hong Kong." Island Cloud looked hesitant, touched his head with one hand, and said, "Hong Kong is also good, but not as convenient as Shanghai." Qi Wan said, "I think it's convenient for me in Hong Kong, because my mother is now in Shanghai. I plan to get married in Hong Kong and then go to Shanghai to see my mother. When my mother sees that I am already married, even if she has any objections, she won't object because it's already a done deal." Island Cloud's expression changed slightly when he heard this, and he said, "That makes sense." Qi Wan said, "Do you think there's anything inconvenient about getting married in Hong Kong?" Island Cloud said, "I...I also have my parents in Hong Kong, and I also plan to inform my parents after the marriage." Qi Wan felt embarrassed when she heard this and said, "You think it's convenient in Shanghai, but I don't think it's convenient; I think it's convenient in Hong Kong, but you don't think it's convenient. This is difficult!"
