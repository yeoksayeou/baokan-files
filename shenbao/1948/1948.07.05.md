The air force's Yellow Sea, East Sea, Bohai Sea, and heavy bomber squadrons, in order to eliminate the main bandit force of Chen and Liu in the Yellow River flooded area, deployed in large formations over the Sui and Qi battlefields all day long. Rain of bullets wove across the sky, and the entire battlefield was suppressed under the iron wings. The National Army's Huang Baitao's troops, centered on Tiefosi and Diqiudian, conducted a radial sweep of the bandits in all directions. Under the suppression of heavy bombers and the fierce attack of the army, the bandit army began to retreat to the rear on the afternoon of the 4th, and the entire war situation took a sharp turn for the worse.

[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 4th] The great battle in eastern Henan is still fiercely ongoing in the east and west areas of Suixian. Yesterday, the National Army's westward advancing corps engaged in a fierce battle with the bandit's 1st and 11th Columns in the Diqiudian area east of Suixian, with a great number of enemy killed.

[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 4th] Du Yuming flew over the Yellow River flooded area battlefield at 11 a.m. on the 3rd to supervise the battle, and then flew to Zhengzhou. According to reports, Du has accepted the invitation of Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi to serve as Deputy Commander of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters. The presidential order arrived in Xuzhou at noon on the 3rd.

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, 4th] Military News: Chen Geng's bandit troops, the 4th and 6th Columns, have fled from Wuyang to the vicinity of Xiping, attempting to prevent the National Army on the Pinghan Railway from joining forces.

[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 4th] Fierce fighting continued in Yanzhou yesterday. The bandit's 7th Column launched a full-scale attack on the southwestern suburbs. The struggle for Qianyao, Zhao Village, and Shuangfang was fierce. The National Army, in coordination with the air force, counterattacked the bandits, annihilating many bandits. The battle is still fiercely ongoing in the southwestern suburbs.

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 4th] In order to relieve the siege of Yanzhou, crack troops of the National Army from Jinan moved south. The western route recovered Pingyin and, starting on the 2nd, the main force continued to advance eastward, now reaching the outskirts of Feicheng. The eastern route of the National Army moving south along the railway crossed Jieshou, Daxiaoxinzhuang, and Erzhonglipu on the 3rd, and also reached the suburbs of Tai'an in the afternoon. The bandit Tai'an Independent Regiment and the Taining Independent Regiment in the city were greatly panicked.

[Special Dispatch from Jinan, 4th] The National Army advancing towards Tai'an captured the key point of Majialing near Tai'an in one fell swoop on the morning of the 4th, killing more than a thousand bandits. By 3 p.m. on the 4th, the National Army's outposts had reached the outskirts of Tai'an.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 4th] Our southern advancing troops in Jinan frequently report victories, and the recovery of Tai'an is within reach. This reporter accompanied our mechanized troops to the front line for an inspection at 1 p.m. on the 4th. The weather was gloomy today, with drizzling rain. The car passed Wande and met General Wu Huawen at a dilapidated village shop. He said in a firm tone, "I will wrestle with the bandit's 13th Column" to comfort the people. Afterwards, the reporter drove south and arrived at the 4280 Highland of Majialing, ten kilometers northwest of Tai'an, which had just been recovered ten hours ago, at 4 p.m. This place is an important outer stronghold of the bandits in Tai'an. At 6 a.m. on the 4th, our army defeated and occupied the 114th Regiment of the 38th Division of the bandit's 13th Column in one fell swoop, killing more than 500 bandits. The reporter inspected back and forth, and the bandit corpses were lying all over the place, in a very embarrassing state, and the stench was suffocating. Because the bandits stubbornly defended the Xiaochuan stronghold north of the mountain, more than 80 bodies were accumulated. Our army has now completed the encirclement of Tai'an, and the vanguard has crossed Zhouzhuang, eight kilometers west of Tai'an. The reporter returned to Jinan along the railway line at 6 p.m., and refugees returning to their hometowns were constantly on the way, all showing joyful expressions.

The National Army is dividing its forces to suppress and annihilate them.

### Bandits Seize a Large Amount of New Wheat in the Battle of Changli

Secretary's Wife Was Actually a Spy

[Special Dispatch from Qinhuangdao, 4th] It is reported that when the bandits captured Changli on the 25th, Tang Yisheng, commander of the traffic police detachment, and the commanders of the 5th and 8th Regiments were captured. Deputy Commander Nie committed suicide after killing his wife because she was injured. The bandits seized 1.5 million catties of new wheat concentrated in the city, 4,000 large bags of flour, and 1 million catties of grain. It was learned after the fact that the wife of a secretary of the traffic police headquarters and two middle school teachers were all working personnel sent by the bandits. In a tense moment, the secretary's wife told the secretary, "Don't be afraid! I'll protect you!" Also, the National Army that recovered Changli was the 8th Army, which treated wounded and sick people and cleaned up the battlefield. Their strict military discipline was extremely moving. When the National Army entered the city, the bandits had already fled far away after destroying fortifications. Many bandit cadres were captured, because the bandits were planning to hold a "Poor Peasants Struggle Conference" of 4,000 people. The plan had just been made when the National Army entered the city. Now, the wheat harvest in Changli and Luan counties has been robbed, and the people's food has become a major problem.

### Adhering to Consistent Position on the Peace Treaty with Japan; China Completes Preliminary Draft; Ye Gongchao Discusses the Negotiation and Convening Process of the Peace Conference with Japan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Vice Minister Ye Gongchao of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today to inquire about the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. Ye gave the following detailed account of the negotiations between our government and the relevant countries regarding the convening of the peace conference with Japan:

The world situation is becoming increasingly serious, and the differences of opinion among the Allies on various issues are still deepening and expanding. Therefore, a comprehensive peace after the war has not yet been restored. The failure to complete the peace treaties with Germany and Japan has also strained the relations between the Allies.

Over the past two years, our government has made many efforts to sign peace treaties with Germany and Japan. However, due to disagreements among the countries on the organization and procedures of the peace conference, mutual discussions have become deadlocked.

In July of the thirty-sixth year, the United States proposed convening a preparatory meeting for the peace conference with Japan, advocating that eleven countries that fought against Japan should jointly draft the peace treaty with equal qualifications, and the resolution should be established by a two-thirds vote. Although our government was not satisfied with the method proposed by the United States at the time, in order to promote the early opening of the peace conference with Japan and the early conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan, it did not immediately give a positive or negative answer at the time. However, it declared that if any country refused to accept the conference proposed by the United States, China would reconsider its position on this matter and proposed that the final conference of the peace treaty with Japan could be held in China. Later, because the Soviet Union insisted that the preparatory meeting for the peace conference with Japan should only be composed of the four countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, the US proposal was fruitless. In September of the thirty-sixth year, Minister Wang went to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly. His main purpose was to take this opportunity to discuss the issue of convening a peace conference with Japan with representatives from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union outside the meeting. Minister Wang repeatedly consulted with the US Secretary of State and the British and Soviet representatives on this matter and strongly urged them to accept a compromise plan proposed by China. However, the general deterioration of relations among the Allies made Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union unwilling to give a definite answer to our proposal. In November of the thirty-sixth year, China, in view of the early restoration of peace and normalcy in the Far East, formally sent notes to the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, proposing to convene a preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible. It also formally proposed a compromise proposal in order to quickly break the deadlock. This proposal was that the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty should be attended by eleven countries, not limited to the four countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Motions in the meeting could be decided by a majority vote, but this majority must include the four countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. In other words, these four countries should each retain veto power. Our country's plan respects the interests of the eleven countries that actually participated in the war against Japan on the one hand; on the other hand, it can enable China to obtain special guarantees in the peace conference, so that it will not be forced to accept a draft peace treaty that China opposes. Moreover, since the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union also enjoy this kind of guarantee, they have no reason to oppose this plan. Unexpectedly, the Soviet Union's reply still insisted on its four-country meeting proposal. After we repeatedly urged agreement, it still only allowed the other seven countries to participate in the small group committee of the preparatory meeting for the peace treaty with Japan, but did not allow them to attend the preparatory meeting to participate in the vote. Australia strongly opposed the Soviet Union's proposal and believed that it could not agree to our compromise plan. The US government has so far remained silent on the compromise plan proposed by our side. As a result, the issue of the peace conference with Japan has been shelved again. As for the draft peace treaty with Japan, our government has been continuously preparing since Japan surrendered. In August of the thirty-sixth year, a special agency was set up to divide the main clauses of the peace treaty into special topics for in-depth research. At the same time, opinions from all parties were solicited, and relevant government departments also sent representatives to participate in providing opinions. The preliminary draft of the peace treaty has been completed. Currently, the research work is still in progress. From the above facts, it can be seen that our government has fulfilled its due responsibilities for the issue of convening a peace conference with Japan. The reason why the peace conference with Japan has not been convened so far is not because the Chinese government has failed to fulfill its responsibilities. The government will naturally continue to seek the early conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan in the future, in order to meet the expectations of the people of the whole country. At the same time, our government will maintain its consistent position so that China can maintain a special position in the peace conference. Only in this way can we hope to realize a peace treaty that we believe can guarantee China's interests and world peace.

### Xiao Zheng Scheduled to Submit the Draft Farmland Reform Law to the Legislative Yuan for Discussion Today

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] In order to solve China's land problem, the China Land Reform Association, after gathering land reform experts for many days of research, has drafted a "Draft Farmland Reform Law," which will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan by Xiao Zheng, chairman of the association, in his capacity as a legislator. At 4 p.m. on the 4th, Xiao specially invited legislators, land administration experts, and news reporters who were enthusiastic about land reform to publish the content of the draft and to exchange opinions extensively with various legislators, supplementing and revising the original draft. The draft was drafted based on Article 143 of the Constitution, and its purpose is to implement "land to the tillers." According to the provisions of the past "Draft Farmland Reform Law," all farmland in the country shall be owned by farmers who cultivate it themselves from the date of implementation of the law. The area of farmland owned by a self-cultivating farmer's household shall not exceed the scope necessary to maintain the livelihood of a family of eight. However, the farmland recipient shall compensate the original owner for the land price, and the land price shall not exceed seven times the agreed rent amount, and the total amount shall be calculated based on the main agricultural products of the local area and shall be paid off in fourteen years.

### Using Aid-to-China Funds to Order Surplus Military Supplies; US Army Department Agrees to Provide Maximum Assistance

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The Aid-to-China plan has a bright future due to the signing of the US-China bilateral agreement. At the same time, secret steps are being accelerated regarding China's use of the $125 million military Aid-to-China fund.

China may obtain more war material. Although military aid is included in the Congressional appropriation bill, it is not implemented by the Economic Cooperation Administration. The United States has also agreed to "no conditions," but this reason has made it difficult for the Chinese government to obtain war material. Officials from both the United States and China cannot predict when the first batch of ordnance and equipment will arrive on the Chinese coast. However, sources say that two positive steps have been taken: First, the State Department has given China the details of accounting and how to prepare consumption reports; second, the US government is prepared for China to begin actual orders. China has previously complained that it could not find officials to help them place orders. Now, the Army Department has designated a group of "order" contacts, led by Lieutenant Colonel Kilkrest, who accompanied the Wedemeyer mission to China and recently returned to the United States. According to the Foreign Aid Act, China was originally free to use it, but China believed that without the advice of the United States, they would not be able to obtain the best deal. Especially important, China notified the State Department that they needed to order surplus military supplies because they were cheaper and delivered quickly, and they were unwilling to order newly manufactured equipment and ordnance. The Army Department has agreed to assist China in ordering surplus military supplies as much as possible, including those stored on Pacific islands. In addition, China also hopes to be able to order US ordnance stocks when the surplus military supplies are exhausted, but the latter has not yet been decided because it will be considered whether it is legal.

[Special Dispatch from Guangzhou, 4th] After Colonel Baolin of the US Military Advisory Group and others arrived in Guangzhou, they visited Song Ziwen on the 2nd to discuss new military training matters.

### Supervisory Yuan Symposium Discusses Issues Such as Consent Rights

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] The Control Yuan held a plenary committee symposium at 9:50 a.m. on the 4th, attended by more than 100 committee members, with President Yu presiding. After the meeting began, President Lu said: "Regarding the legal bill issue of this Yuan, according to Article 44 of the Constitution, the President will convene relevant Yuan presidents for consultation. I would like to ask you all to provide your opinions. Also, the President's request for consent of the Grand Justices and Examination Committee members has been sent to this Yuan, and there is another meeting resolution to appoint committee members to investigate prices. How to appoint personnel also needs to be discussed." Afterwards, the Secretary-General reported on the Legislative Yuan's dispute record regarding the discussion process of the legal bills submitted by the Control Yuan. Yuan Qinghui, Cao Dexuan, Ni Bi, Liu Pingjiang, and other committee members spoke successively, all believing that the legal bill issue of this Yuan should be resolved through legal channels and has nothing to do with the adjournment of this Yuan. They advocated resuming the meeting immediately. Others believed that before the legal bills of this Yuan have completed the legislative process, even if the meeting is resumed immediately, there is no basis for discussion, and since it has been decided by the meeting of this Yuan, the meeting cannot be resumed rashly. Tian Tongjin and Chen Darong, the two committee members, both believed that the Control Yuan had the right to submit legal bills in the past, and they hoped that it still has this right now, and they hoped that the relevant Yuan presidents could decide this during their consultation. Committee member Hu Wenhui strongly emphasized that the Control Yuan's exercise of supervisory power is not purely for meetings, but can also be carried out separately. Now that the request for consent for the Grand Justices and Examination Committee members has been sent, the consent rights should be exercised immediately according to the consent rights exercise method to complete the government organization, so that the country and the people can be accommodated. Committee member Gu Fengxiang also proposed that the appointment of committee members to participate in the price investigation team is not urgently needed, and the Shanghai Control Envoy's special commissioner can be ordered to investigate, and the method will be decided after deliberation by the general assembly. Finally, the chairman announced: "Your opinions are invaluable and will be brought up when participating in consultations with the relevant Yuan presidents." The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.

### Bandit Supply Line Inside and Outside the Pass Destroyed and Cut Off by the Navy; Gui Yongqing Discusses Maritime Operations

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] Military News Agency News: Navy Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing personally led the fleet in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea at the beginning of last month to intercept bandit ships in order to cut off the transport and supply of bandit troops inside and outside the pass. He has now returned to Nanjing. The reporter visited Gui yesterday, and he gave a very detailed account of the operations in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea and the situation of the operations on the Yangtze River. Gui first pointed out that the current maritime transport of bandit troops in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea is the main transportation supply line for bandit troops inside and outside the pass. During this cruise in the Shandong sea area and the Bohai Bay for more than 20 days, almost every day bandit ships were intercepted and destroyed by our ships. In the Shandong Peninsula's marine areas, Shidao, Wanzhou Bay, Hutouya, Sanshan Bay, Guajiao, Yuanqikou, and the Liaodong Peninsula's Yingkou, Gaiping, and the Daqing River and Yanghekou areas, more than 100 bandit supply ships were destroyed and captured by our ships. Our ships also shelled the bandit positions in Shidao, Rongcheng Bay, Weihaiwei, and Lejiakou. Commander-in-Chief Gui personally commanded the fleet and went deep into Yingkou Inner Harbor, bombing the West Fort and the bandit power plant in Yingshi. All the bandit fortifications and positions in these ports were destroyed by us. The bandit troops originally defended various ports as bases for transshipment and supply. After this destruction, they have now lost their function, which has a significant impact on the overall war situation. Gui then described the Yangtze River defense operations, constantly pointing to the map hanging on the wall to explain. In total, in March and April of this year, our Yangtze River defense fleet engaged in more than 50 battles of all sizes with bandit troops, killing 673 bandits, capturing 40 bandits, sinking 160 bandit ships, seizing more than 200 dan of bandit grain, and rescuing 20 merchant ships from distress. After May of this year, the battles became more intense. As a result of our navy's fleet's suppression along the river, a total of more than 3,000 bandit troops were killed and 40 bandit ships were sunk in May and June. The bandit troops' dream of crossing the river was completely shattered. Gui also stated at the end that he will soon return to the sea to command operations.

### Youth Party Issues Statement: Decides to Join the Executive Yuan, Two Political Affairs Committee Members to Be Nominated Separately

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Youth Party held a Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday (the 4th) at 3 PM to discuss the issue of joining the government, which lasted until 9 PM. At 10 PM, Li Huang immediately notified Lei Zhen, declaring that the party had decided to join the government and requesting him to pass on the message. Zuo Shunsheng and Chen Qitian, the two ministers of Agriculture and Forestry, and Industry and Commerce, respectively, will proceed to the capital to assume their posts. It is now heard that the party intends to nominate other individuals for the positions of political affairs committee members, which were originally intended for Zheng Zhenwen and Yang Yongjun, and is currently seeking government approval. The party has also decided to participate in the Legislative Yuan, but the number of seats has not yet been announced.

Furthermore, Wang Shizeng, the spokesperson for the Youth Party, issued the following written statement on the 4th: Our party, from participating in the Constitutional National Assembly to the Implementing Constitutional National Assembly, has consistently adhered to the principle of promoting the implementation of democratic constitutionalism and completing the construction of a modern nation. We have cooperated sincerely with the Kuomintang and the Democratic Socialist Party to share the responsibility of implementing the constitution and building the nation. Previously, due to the long-standing unresolved issue of legislators, our party repeatedly stated that it could not participate in the Executive Yuan until the issue of legislators was resolved, as it believed that democratic politics required seats in parliament before it could be involved in government. For over a month, we have been continuously negotiating with responsible figures of the Kuomintang to resolve the issue of legislators. In the spirit of mutual understanding and compromise, we have gradually achieved a principle agreement, but due to practical difficulties, it will still take a considerable amount of time to fully realize. During this period of back-and-forth negotiation, we have received repeated encouragements from Mr. Zhang Yuejun, Mr. Wu Tiecheng, Mr. Chen Bulei, and Mr. Lei Jingshi, conveying the intentions of the responsible authorities of the Kuomintang, earnestly urging us to carry out the cooperation between the three parties, continue to participate in the government, and jointly overcome the difficulties of the times. Mr. Wu Tiecheng and Mr. Chen Bulei, in their capacities as responsible figures of the Kuomintang, have successively issued statements, reiterating the purpose and desire for cooperation between the three parties, with exceptionally sincere language. Based on our sense of responsibility to the nation and our acceptance of the sincerity of cooperation from friendly parties, our party has decided, following our participation in the Control Yuan and the nomination of Grand Justices of the Judicial Yuan and Examination Committee Members of the Examination Yuan, to propose candidates to participate in the Executive Yuan and continue to participate in the Executive Yuan, to share a portion of the responsibilities of governance, with the hope of making some contributions to national affairs.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] Following the publication of the written statements by Chen Bulei and Wu Tiecheng, urging the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party to continue the spirit of unity among the three parties, participate in the Executive Yuan, and jointly promote government affairs, it is heard that the Youth Party has agreed to this. Zuo Shunsheng and Chen Qitian, the Youth Party members in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, have scheduled to arrive in the capital from Shanghai on the night train of the 5th to attend the political affairs meeting held on Wednesday. As for the political affairs committee members appointed before the president, it is said that Zheng Zhenwen and Yang Yongjun, members of the party, will resign. Under the extension of the Executive Yuan President Yun Wenhao, the party has proposed Lin Keji and Liu Jingyuan to serve as political affairs committee members. It is also understood that the President is aware of the Youth Party's separate appointment of political affairs committee members, so the appointment order is expected to be issued soon. Furthermore, the Democratic Socialist Party has not yet expressed its position on this matter. Xu Chuanlin stated that he would not participate in the Executive Yuan. As for the legislators, if the Kuomintang can make further concessions by five seats, the Democratic Socialist Party will collectively attend the Legislative Yuan meeting.

### More Than Two Hundred Legislators Form Innovation Club

Its Spokesperson Discusses the Purpose of Its Establishment

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The Innovation Club, initiated by more than two hundred legislators, was established last month. Its spokesperson recently stated: The purpose of the Innovation Club is to connect emotionally, exchange opinions, unite progressive elements, and jointly promote political innovation. As our country embarks on constitutionalism, it is essential for the people to learn democratic practices and cultivate democratic habits. Since parliamentary politics is the implementation of a democratic way of life, colleagues in the Legislative Yuan should take the lead in advocating and utilizing it properly to lay the foundation for democratic politics. Now, during the period of suppressing the rebellion, society is turbulent and uneasy, and the people eagerly yearn for governance. The expectations for the Legislative Yuan are particularly keen. On one hand, we must form a stable force, and on the other hand, we must seek progress through innovation and stability through progress. Therefore, after the establishment of the Innovation Club, while paying close attention to the emotional connection of members and the improvement of their living interests, research on political innovation is also actively underway. It has now been divided into seven groups: Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Economy, Finance, Education, Culture, and Legal System. Members participate freely, and experts from outside the Legislative Yuan are invited to participate in discussions from time to time to gather ideas and broaden perspectives. The spokesperson also stated that the Innovation Club is not only of political significance but also fully expresses the spirit of democracy and freedom. It is firmly believed that it can promote the innovation of Chinese politics and the realization of democratic constitutionalism.

### Editorial: Review of the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement

The bilateral agreement regarding American aid has attracted attention both domestically and internationally and was signed in the capital at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. The key points and full text were detailed in yesterday's newspaper. Among them, the necessity of stabilizing our country's economy is emphasized. It agrees to freeze part of the legal tender to reduce currency in circulation and specifies that the Chinese government can effectively use the assets of Chinese citizens in the United States to improve the domestic economic situation. However, there is no provision requiring our country to grant Japan and South Korea most-favored-nation treatment in trade. These points should be what our people are most excited about.

There are varying estimates regarding the amount of Chinese citizens' deposits in the United States, ranging from as high as four to five billion to as low as three to four hundred million, differing by more than tenfold. However, if all of it could flow back into the country, regardless of the amount, its contribution to finance and the economy would be substantial. We will not discuss coercive methods such as requisition or taxation for now. Simply utilizing them through borrowing, remittances, purchasing goods, or transferring them to domestic banks would greatly facilitate the adjustment of foreign exchange funds and the promotion of foreign trade, far exceeding what American aid could achieve. Unfortunately, the United States does not assist in the execution of handling these assets but only allows our country to independently investigate and identify them and take measures within a feasible range to ensure their proper use. We do not know to what extent this will actually be achieved in the future, or whether it will remain a pie in the sky, desirable but unattainable. This is difficult to predict.

Creating a more stable monetary situation is stipulated in Article 2, Item C of the agreement. The method involves freezing a portion of the legal tender obtained from the sale of American aid materials after it is deposited into a special account at the Central Bank. This principle has long been advocated by the financial authorities and supported by general public opinion. Because to seek economic stability, currency and price stability must be sought first, and to demand currency and price stability, one must start from balancing income and expenditure and reducing issuance. Therefore, how to fully and effectively utilize these funds is a major key to the current financial and economic situation. Although the agreement adopts a freezing method to reduce currency in circulation and tighten credit, which is an effective measure for treating the symptoms, if income and expenditure cannot be balanced, increased issuance will still be inevitable. If old banknotes are frozen on one hand while new banknotes are issued as usual on the other, what benefit will this have for stabilizing the economy? It will only allow Chinese and foreign banknote merchants to continue making a fortune from printing money and increase a large expense for the national treasury.

The scope of the so-called legal tender freeze is not the entire proceeds from the sale of materials, but only a part, or even a small part. Because according to the items listed in Article 5 of the agreement, the following must be deducted: (1) All administrative expenses of American institutions in China; (2) Expenditures for developing production and exploiting resources; (3) Expenditures for implementing relevant construction plans or projects; (4) Expenses for continuing relief or work relief projects that have not been completed under the relief agreement; (5) Expenses for promoting rationing in major cities. Moreover, after the total amount of American aid is reduced to 400 million US dollars, the economic aid portion is only 275 million, and according to Section 407 (B) of the Aid to China Act, one percent of rural reconstruction expenses must also be deducted. Calculated in this way, how much legal tender remains that can be frozen, and whether it can still achieve the purpose of contracting currency and stabilizing the economy, is difficult to predict.

During the discussion of this case in the US Congress, many people pointed out the danger of inflation in our country and fervently demanded that it be stopped first. There were many people in our country who sympathized with this claim. As a result, the legal tender from the sale of materials is still so fragmented and cannot be concentrated on the most urgent needs. Undoubtedly, this will make efforts to balance finance and stabilize our economy much more difficult. Some people believe that since the assets of Chinese citizens in the United States are permitted to be fully and effectively utilized, the problem of inflation may be solved from this aspect. We deeply hope that this speculation is not purely ideal.

American aid is divided into two major parts: economic aid and special aid. Except for a small part of the economic aid that will be used for special construction, which may require separate negotiations for repayment in the future, the rest is a gift. We naturally express our deep gratitude for the generosity and enthusiasm of the United States. But at the same time, we should also understand that there will be many major responsibilities and arduous tasks that come with it. We must fulfill them in practice to fulfill the promise of self-help. Foreign Minister Wang has generally pointed out that China must take possible measures to utilize its own resources and national financial resources to develop industry and agriculture, improve the financial and monetary system, reduce trade barriers, and increase foreign commercial relations. These are all long-term tasks that cannot be accomplished overnight. It is hoped that everyone will do their best in their respective positions to jointly shoulder this major mission.

### Opening Luan Coal Mine Timber Shortage: Negotiations with the Allied Headquarters for Purchasing Japanese-Produced Timber Yield No Results, Failure to Negotiate Will Affect Production

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] According to Cheng Yifa, Secretary-General of the Kailuan Mining Bureau: If the negotiations between the Luan Mine representatives and the Allied Headquarters regarding the purchase of Japanese-produced timber fail, it will affect the entire industry along the railway line from Zhangjiakou to Jinzhou and Kailuan, as well as 70% of Shanghai's industry. The current negotiations are fraught with difficulties, and the entire issue must be handled by Chief of Staff Mueller at headquarters. It is reported that General Shang Zhen has already written to Mueller about this matter. According to Cheng, Kailuan Coal Mine only has enough timber reserves to last for two months. After the timber supply from Jilin, North Korea, and Sakhalin Island was cut off, Luan Mine has relied entirely on Japanese timber since the end of the war. Last year, Luan Mine obtained a total of three million timbers. Five months ago, Luan Mine, through the Central Trust Bureau, negotiated the purchase of 43 million timbers in exchange for 200,000 tons of coking coal, which Japan urgently needed, but the negotiations failed. Therefore, Cheng and Faulkner, a British senior staff member of Luan Mine, came to Japan and visited Ma Guide, Director of the Bureau of Economic Science, Mr. Clark, Chief of the Foreign Trade Section, and other relevant authorities. However, all parties showed no interest in Kailuan's proposal, stating that Japan also needs to increase timber production in order to achieve its goal of producing 36 million tons of coal this year. Forestry department personnel stated that Japan must preserve its forests as much as possible to prevent floods. Cheng stated that Kailuan Mine currently produces 15,000 tons of coal per day, but if the mine has sufficient materials, increasing it to over 18,000 tons would not be difficult. Kailuan Mine currently has 400,000 tons of coal in storage, which will reach 800,000 tons by the end of the year. When asked by reporters what would happen if the negotiations failed, Cheng stated that either production would be suspended, or timber would be imported from the United States and Canada. If so, the consumption of time and money would also increase.

He told the press that the US$400 million in US aid to China would allow China to maintain the status quo, but would not be enough for us to move forward. Chen optimistically said that China has experienced difficulties many times in history and has always been able to overcome them. He believed that although the current problems are serious, they can still be resolved in the same way as in the past. He said: "I have met with Vandenberg and was deeply impressed by the democratic steps taken by the United States. The purpose of my visit to the United States is to study the democratic system and report to President Chiang. Therefore, I am particularly impressed with the process of this Republican National Convention. For example, the modesty of Stassen and Taft to Dewey, so that Dewey won the unanimous nomination of all Republicans, is a great demonstration of democracy in action. President Chiang wrote a letter to introduce me to several congressmen and Mr. Dewey, but I have not yet visited them, because they are busy due to the Congressional recess and the Republican National Convention." Chen is now planning to visit his alma mater, the University of Pittsburgh, whose president has sent a telegram to Chen urging him to return to his alma mater. On this trip, he also wants to visit John L. Lewis, the president of the Mining Union. When he was studying mining in the United States, he joined the Mining Union in Scranton as an intern. Chen accused the Chinese Communist Party of being extremely inhumane when fighting the government army. He said: "The Communist Party always uses the old and weak as vanguards, so that the government army cannot shoot. The Communist Party also trains the old and weak to fight at night, so it is difficult to identify them. Sometimes we open fire and find that the innocent victims are all civilians. Sometimes we do not open fire, but the people who charge are Communist troops. When the Communist Party fights, it does not try to occupy cities, but seeks to destroy cities. Therefore, the government must find ways to provide relief, and more troops are constrained. The psychological effect of these strategies is actually one of the reasons for inflation. After all, modern warfare is not a matter of calculation, it is an economic and political nature." Chen added: "China urgently needs land and banking reform." He admitted that the treatment of Chinese government troops is very poor, so they often harass villagers to obtain food. He compared China to a patient who not only needs blood transfusions and foreign aid, but also needs to clean up the interior and help themselves. He also cited the fact that general banks are unwilling to make long-term land mortgages due to our unstable situation, so long-term planning work cannot be carried out, as an example of how the war hinders stability.

### The Soviet Union Refuses to Guarantee the Cancellation of the Blockade: The Situation in Berlin Deteriorates: Sokolovsky Bitterly Criticizes the Three Powers' Measures Against Germany

[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky invited British Commander-in-Chief Robertson, US Commander-in-Chief Clay, and French Commander-in-Chief Noiret to his headquarters for a meeting last night. He refused to guarantee the cancellation of the blockade of West Berlin and bitterly criticized the measures of the Western countries. His attitude was rare in diplomatic history. According to the German News Agency registered with the Soviet authorities, Sokolovsky made the following remarks to the four commanders at the meeting: "The unilateral separatist measures taken by the British, American, and French authorities have created the difficulties they are currently facing. Didn't those who participated in the London Conference to decide on the division of Germany know the consequences that their decisions would cause and the Berlin issue? Now that the Western powers have decided to divide Germany, why are they only thinking about Berlin now? Berlin is in the Soviet zone and is economically a part of the Soviet zone. The representatives of the three Western countries freely made decisions about Germany without the participation of the Soviet Union, and even without notifying the Soviet Union. This is acting without regard for the interests of the German people. The attempt of the four countries to destroy the German economic system forced the Soviet authorities to take measures to protect the 20 million Germans in the Soviet zone. This is one of the important tasks of the Soviet occupation of Germany." A related source said that Sokolovsky spoke through an interpreter. He entered the room after the three Western commanders entered the meeting room, and only slightly bowed and sat down, without shaking hands with the three commanders present. During the half-hour meeting, he always stared at the documents on the table and did not look at the three commanders present. After bitterly criticizing the various measures of the Western countries, he also said, "My friends, we don't need these anymore." General Clay said afterwards that his stay in the meeting room for 30 minutes was only to observe diplomatic etiquette. French Commander-in-Chief Noiret also frankly admitted that the situation has deteriorated even further than before.

[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] The half-hour meeting of the four commanders here tonight was fruitless, but made the situation in Berlin even more serious than before. It is generally believed that the solution to the Berlin crisis can only be hoped for if the highest authorities of the four countries jointly discuss effective action. It is reported that the three powers of Britain, the United States, and France have drafted a joint protest to Moscow, intending to submit the entire issue to a higher authority. British observers believe that once the Berlin dispute is officially handed over to the government authorities, due to the reputation involved, it will inevitably make it more difficult for the Soviet government to meet the minimum requirements put forward by the Western powers in order to continue the four-power co-governance in Berlin. British Foreign Secretary Henderson met with officials from various Western allies in Berlin today to hear reports on the recent situation in Berlin. He is scheduled to return to London on the 4th. In addition, the London Committee, composed of US Ambassador to the UK Douglas, French Ambassador to the UK Massigli, and British Foreign Office German Division Director Strang, will remain open on the weekend to await the latest intelligence from Berlin.

[United Press, Berlin, 3rd] US Commander-in-Chief Clay declared after the fruitless meeting that the airlift will continue and increase more than before. We will maintain it for a long time according to the wishes of the American people. In the past, it took a year to airlift supplies to China over the Hump. He believes that France will also participate in the emergency airlift to supply the people of West Berlin.

### Albania Unilaterally Abrogates Economic Agreement: South Criticizes as Violating International Law: Declares that Albania Must Be Responsible for the Consequences of this Move

[Reuters, Belgrade, 3rd] The Yugoslav official news agency said that the Yugoslav government today sent a note to the Albanian government, replying to the Albanian government's unilateral revocation of the economic agreement and attachments between the two countries. The note explained that under the economic cooperation plan between the two countries, Albania, whose economy was backward and whose war wounds had not yet recovered, had benefited greatly. Albania's claim that the South had failed to faithfully fulfill its treaty obligations was obviously inaccurate and ridiculous.

Moreover, the South-Albanian economic agreement expressly stipulated that in the event of any problems arising from the implementation of the economic cooperation plan, both parties should seek a solution in a friendly and sincere manner. Albania has obviously failed to comply with this provision, and its unilateral breach of contract violates the basic principles of international law. Therefore, the Albanian government must be responsible for the consequences arising therefrom. According to reports, Albania's decision to sever economic relations with the South was notified to the South Korean Embassy in Tirana on July 1 in a note, and on the previous day, June 30, the Albanian government had notified the South Korean government to recall all technical personnel, professors, and other South Korean citizens sent to Albania to "help its revitalization with fraternal feelings." According to reports, the South and Albania signed an economic agreement at the end of 1946, which was equivalent to establishing an economic alliance, stipulating the abolition of tariffs between the two countries, establishing free business relations, and Yugoslavia assisting Albania's industrial recovery.

### Albanian Economy Depends on Others: Daring to Provoke the Tiger

[United Press, London, 4th, One Telegram] The precise system of military alliances and economic agreements between the Eastern European satellite countries under the backing of the Soviet Union has begun to collapse on the 4th. Albania announced the abolition of the 30-year customs and currency alliance with Yugoslavia, as a strong consequence of Marshal Tito's expulsion from the Communist family. Yugoslavia's resistance to the Kremlin is astonishing, but Albania's provocation of the tiger is even more astonishing. Albania is separated from the Soviet Union by Yugoslavia and its economy depends on the South. Therefore, it was unexpected that it would do this without the Soviet Union's guarantee. Now that the South and Albania have turned against each other, it has overshadowed the rift between Stalin and Tito, because the latter is still awaiting the final decision of the Kremlin.

### South-Albania Breakup Case: May Be Submitted to the Hague Court

[United Press, Belgrade, 4th] Authoritative sources said on the 4th that Yugoslavia may submit the case of the breakup with Albania to the United Nations or the Hague International Court of Justice. The international law experts of this person said that judging from the last few paragraphs of the protest sent by Yugoslavia to Albania, filing a petition seems to be the second inevitable step. There is no sign that the official has adopted this step or not, but observers believe that if Albania is still determined not to compromise, then South Korea's request for international arbitration may occur.

### Soviet and Dutch Trade Agreement

[Reuters, The Hague, 4th] The Kingdom of the Netherlands signed a business agreement with the Soviet Union today, stipulating that Soviet raw materials will be exchanged for Dutch machinery and manufactured goods.

### One Quarter of Wages in West Berlin: Issued in New Currency

[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] The authorities in West Berlin recently issued an order concerning the currency system, announcing that only one-quarter of the wages of workers in West Berlin will be paid in Deutsche Marks. Business people believe that this move by the Western allies is equivalent to recognizing the East German Mark issued by the Soviet Union. The West Berlin authorities' announcement also clarified that the Western authorities never intended to base the West Berlin economy entirely on the Deutsche Mark. Therefore, it was previously stipulated that East German Marks could also be used to pay rent, rationed food, and transportation expenses in West Berlin. The amount of Deutsche Marks issued by the authorities in West Berlin is only sufficient to maintain Berlin's economic relations with West Germany and participate in international trade.

### The Highest Goal of the United States: Establishing Ten Chapters of Peace

President Truman's Speech

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] President Truman said today at the centennial commemoration ceremony of the laying of the cornerstone of the Washington Monument that the goal of the United States is only to bring peace based on public reason to the world. The United States participated in two world wars to fight for world freedom. The United States has no territorial ambitions and does not demand compensation. He hopes that the great politician Marshall can make the United States an active caregiver for peace.

### Bernadotte's Peace Plan Announced: Advocating the Formation of a Federation Between Arabs and Jews: Suggests that the Security Council Will Be Reported If Rejected

[Reuters, Success Lake, 4th] Officials here revealed that the permanent peace negotiations in Palestine by UN Mediator Bernadotte stipulated the organization of a federation of Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem划into the Arab state. This proposal was submitted to both the Arabs and Jews on June 28. Bernadotte's proposed Jewish-Arab Federation stipulated that it should be built on the original Palestinian mandated territory, including parts of what is now the Kingdom of Outer Jordan. All or part of the Negev Desert area in southern Palestine should be划into the Arab state, and all or part of the Galilee province in the north should be划into the Jewish state. Although Jerusalem is划into the Arab state, Jewish residents should enjoy municipal autonomy. Haifa Port and Lydda should be opened as free seaports and free airports respectively.

In addition, Bernadotte's proposal also advocated the following: (1) The borders between the Jewish and Arab states should be negotiated first with Bernadotte's assistance, and then affirmed and surveyed by the border committee. (2) The Palestinian Federation should promote common economic interests, maintain common undertakings such as tariffs and other treasury taxes, implement construction and development plans, and contact diplomatic defense policies. (3) These powers are exercised by a central committee. (3) The entry and immigration within the national borders of the Jewish and Arab states shall be handled by the Jewish and Arab states, but two years after the establishment of the federation, any one of the Jewish and Arab states may request the federal committee to review the immigration issues within the other country. The minor points in Bernadotte's proposal include protecting the rights of religions and minorities, protecting holy sites and religious facilities, and allowing residents who have been displaced by the conflict to return to their homes. Bernadotte also stated that if the above and other subsequent suggestions can be used as a basis for discussion, he will continue his mediation mission. If rejected, he will promptly report to the Security Council.

### Bernadotte Leaves Cairo, Quickly Returns to Rhodes

The Arab League Presents Counter-Proposals to Bernadotte

[Reuters, Cairo, 4th] Before departing Cairo for Rhodes today, Bernadotte had a long meeting with Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy, during which Nokrashy presented Bernadotte with the Arab nations' official response to Bernadotte's proposals, which included counter-proposals. Bernadotte stated afterward that he expects to receive the Jewish side's response to his proposals tomorrow and will spend several days studying them. Bernadotte secretly conferred with the Arab League's key committee last night. Afterward, Lebanese Prime Minister Solh, who attended the meeting, stated that the Arab side had informed Bernadotte that it could not accept his proposals as a basis for negotiation, as the Arab side remains steadfast in its demand to establish an Arab state in Palestine. Furthermore, Arab sources in Cairo anticipate that the Jewish side will also reject Bernadotte's proposals, as the inclusion of the Negev region in an Arab state would force the Jewish side to halt immigration and cut off the Jewish state's connection to the Dead Sea potash industry, which is one of its primary sources of income. Additionally, the Jewish state advocates for Jerusalem to be placed under United Nations trusteeship and opposes placing it under Arab jurisdiction.

### Rumor: Ho Chi Minh Travels to Soviet Capital

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 4th] According to sources on the communist side, Ho Chi Minh recently traveled to Moscow. This news has been confirmed by a recent commentary in the Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" regarding the Vietnam Agreement.

### Republican Party Likely to Win Next U.S. Presidential Election

Opinions of Top American Journalists

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] According to Newsweek, leading American political writers unanimously predict that the Republican Party will win the presidential election this year. Newsweek surveyed fifty top political journalists in Washington, asking which party, Democratic or Republican, was likely to win the next presidential election and what the most important factors influencing the election were. They unanimously predicted a Republican victory, citing the Democratic Party's long tenure in power, a lack of faith in Truman and his administration, internal divisions within the Democratic Party, and Wallace's organization of a third party.

### U.S. to Discuss Military Alliance with Five Western European Nations; Alliance Possible with Greece and Turkey

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Authoritative sources indicated on the 3rd that the United States may immediately consult with the five nations of the Brussels Treaty to establish a military defense alliance against aggression. These five nations include the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.

[United Press, Athens, 3rd] Military and diplomatic sources here predict that Turkish Chief of Staff Omurtag may conclude a military alliance with Greece during his current visit, as he is currently holding secret talks with senior political and military leaders of the government. The United States believes that Turkey's previous concerns about increased Soviet pressure following the Berlin crisis have now been eliminated or resolved, and it has therefore decided to seek active support as a response.

### America Celebrates Independence Day: Nation Engages in Day-Long Revelry and Unrestrained Fun

[Central News Agency, New York, 4th] The American people today celebrate the 172nd anniversary of Independence Day. It is reminiscent of this day in 1776 when the founding fathers, guided by Jefferson's principle of the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, declared American independence. Since then, patriotic speeches and fireworks displays across America have become customary. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are taking advantage of this holiday to visit beaches and other recreational areas. Approximately three million New Yorkers are leaving the city for leisure, while tens of thousands are entering the city for sightseeing. Today's travel will fill highways with an estimated thirty million cars. This year's Fourth of July arrives during a heated national election season, but Americans today will set aside politics and enjoy a day of unrestrained joy.

Over a Hundred Dead

[United Press, Chicago, 3rd] Due to Independence Day revelry, the number of accidental deaths in the United States had already exceeded one hundred by the evening of the 3rd, and this is only the beginning. Millions of Americans are leaving cities for the countryside and beaches for the weekend, creating unprecedented travel congestion. The death toll is rising sharply with the holiday; at least 122 people have already died. Vehicle accidents caused 65 deaths, drownings 20, explosions 1, plane crashes 2, and other causes 34. Among the states, New York and Pennsylvania each recorded the highest number of deaths at nine.

### The Turbulent Latin America

—America's Underside—

Colombia: Population of 10 million, struggling due to inflation.

Economically, its main industries are oil and precious metal production. Factories producing consumer goods have increased. Coffee exports are second only to Brazil.

The government led by President Ospina Pérez is a democratic institution. There are approximately 10,000 communists. A major bloody rebellion occurred this April. Currently, unless communist leader Ospina can control the opposition parties to prevent a revolution, small-scale riots are possible.

Six Central American Nations: Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, with a combined population of 9 million. The region's exports include fruit, coffee, cocoa, cotton, sugar, gold, livestock, and fibers. The state of inflation is milder than in South America. Except for Panama and Costa Rica, revolutions and dictatorships occur constantly. Except for Costa Rica, communist forces are weak.

Sent by Weng Shaoqiu from New York

The current political trends in each country are as follows:

Revolution feared in Guatemala.

The government structure in El Salvador is unsound.

Costa Rica is teetering on the brink after the first revolution in twenty years.

Panama recently experienced turmoil due to elections.

Cuba: Population of 5 million. Its economic lifeline is sugar production, with Cuba's sugar output ranking first in the world.

The Cuban government is a democratic institution. There are approximately 150,000 communists, but the communist policy is more focused on expanding its power through political means, with fewer riots.

The last revolution occurred in 1933. There is no current revolutionary trend, but the government fears that a riot will erupt.

Mexico: Previously prone to revolutions, but since a small-scale rebellion in 1938, there has been no political turmoil.

Mexico has a population of 23 million. Industry is gradually increasing, expanding from iron and oil production to pharmaceutical production.

The government led by President Alemán is a democratic government. The Communist Party claims 20,000 members, but it lacks power and there is no imminent serious unrest.

Dominican Republic: Under the rule of Generalissimo Trujillo since 1930.

The national population is 2 million, and the standard of living has gradually improved.

Politically, the government practices a dictatorship. The scale of industry is small. In 1947, rebels attempted to invade from Cuba, but failed.

Generalissimo Trujillo has a secret police force, and as long as the secret police remain loyal to him, there will be no coup.

Haiti: Neighboring the Dominican Republic, with a population of 3 million. Most of the people still live as primitive farmers.

The Haitian government is a democratic organization. Communist forces are weak. A revolution occurred in 1945. There will be no revolution at present.

Venezuela: The main industry is oil, and oil accounts for the majority of exports. The exported unrefined oil ranks first in the world.

Venezuela has a population of 4 million. The government led by President Gallegos is a democratic organization. There are approximately 20,000 communist party members, but they cannot cooperate closely. A revolution occurred in 1946, which failed. The former president attempted to regain power, but there is no current revolutionary trend.

Uruguay: The most democratic country in Latin America, with a population of 2.2 million. The people live better than in other Latin American countries.

The main industries are meat production, flaxseed, and other agricultural products.

A revolution occurred in 1935. The current political situation is stable.

Argentina: Population of 16 million. Generally, the people live better, and industry is more advanced than in other South American countries. Most of the products are consumer goods, but heavy industry has begun to operate.

The Argentine Communist Party claims to have 30,000 members, but its power is not great. A revolution occurred in 1943. The current political situation is stable.

In summary, it can be seen that most Latin American countries have the possibility of maintaining peace, but some countries may experience disasters within a few months, although large-scale revolutions are unlikely. The politics of Latin American countries are generally led by powerful figures, leading governments to stability. However, progress is slow, and the people hope to improve their lives, and some people have taken action to realize their ideals. (To be continued)

### Prominent Democrats Support Eisenhower for President; Roosevelt Jr. and Others Oppose Truman's Nomination

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 3rd] Well-informed sources claim that the movement to support Eisenhower as the Democratic presidential candidate is growing, and many prominent Democrats agree with yesterday's resolution of the Georgia Democratic Convention to invite Eisenhower to participate in the presidential election. Pivon, a member of the National Democratic Committee of Delaware, stated that the 67 Michigan delegates attending the Philadelphia convention may unanimously nominate Eisenhower. New York Mayor O'Dwyer, Roosevelt Jr. in California, and Averell in Chicago all advocate preventing Truman from participating in the election at the Democratic convention. Roosevelt Jr. telegraphed 1,234 Democratic delegates, stating, "In the current world crisis, the Democratic Party urgently needs to nominate a strong and qualified figure as leader."

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] The movement to nominate Eisenhower as the Democratic presidential candidate, bypassing Truman, has increasingly attracted the attention of the American political world today. The 28 delegates from Georgia to the Democratic National Convention have been instructed to vote in favor of Eisenhower, greatly boosting the momentum of the movement to draft Eisenhower. This was decided at the Georgia Democratic Convention, where the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The Georgia delegation is the first to be instructed to vote in favor of Eisenhower at the Democratic National Convention to be held in Philadelphia in mid-July. The Virginia Democratic Party also instructed its National Convention delegates today to support Eisenhower's nomination and oppose anyone who supports Truman's civil rights plan. However, supporters of Truman are eager for Eisenhower to issue a statement to end this nomination movement once and for all.

### Britain Tests High-Energy Atomic Particle Accelerator

[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd] Officials here announced that Britain's most powerful Harwell atomic particle accelerator has now begun operation. The Harwell atomic machine has 6,000 kilowatts of energy per hour and can produce various radioactive elements needed for medical research. The atomic machine is made of lead with a barrier several meters thick to protect workers from attacks by radioactive elements.

### Wind, Rain, and Hail Destroyed Many Houses; Over a Hundred Casualties at Jingjiang Public Hall; Shanghai Bureau and Subei Native Association to Meet Today to Discuss Aftermath

[Reported by this newspaper] Around 2:00 AM yesterday, the weather suddenly changed, with fierce winds and torrential rain descending like an avalanche. Added to this were thunder and lightning. Hail, unseen for over a decade, fell amidst the heavy rain. The entire city of Shanghai was engulfed in this terrifying atmosphere for as long as forty minutes. During this time, due to the excessive force of the wind and rain, many utility poles, fences, billboards, and simple structures were attacked and collapsed. The most tragic incident occurred at the Jingjiang Coffin Storage Hall at No. 2, Lane 306, Dapu Road, where eighty flat houses collapsed, trapping over four hundred refugees under the rubble. As of yesterday afternoon, twenty-seven deaths and eighty-nine injuries had been confirmed.

Before the war, the Jingjiang Public Hall was originally a place for the Jingjiang Native Association to store coffins. Since last October, large numbers of refugees from northern Jiangsu have successively occupied the premises, stacking the stored coffins in one room, with some even abandoned outside. The residents were organized into seventy-four households, some living in the eastern houses, and the rest living in eighty newly built tile houses on the western side, totaling over four hundred people. The area was crowded, noisy, and filthy. Last night, due to the hot weather, everyone was cooling off outside. They only returned to their houses to sleep late at night. Unexpectedly, around 2:00 AM, as they were sound asleep, fierce winds suddenly rose, followed by a barrage of hail, and then torrential rain like a rushing torrent. The houses there, due to their simple construction, could not withstand the attack, and with a loud crash at 2:58 AM, they all collapsed, catching the refugees completely off guard, and everyone was trapped under the rubble. Chaos erupted instantly, with cries shaking the heavens. Upon receiving the report, the police and fire departments immediately notified ambulances from various districts to rush to the rescue. Police Chief Yu Shuping and Fire Chief Zhou Zhaoxiang also led Song Tingjun, head of the Lujiawan Police Substation, Section Chief Zhong He, Wang Lixian, Section Member Dong Yixiang, Police Captain Feng Bojun, Police Officers Zhang Hanqing, Zhao Hengqing, Liu Xianglin, and more than ten others, personally braving the rain to rush to the scene to direct the rescue. After more than ten hours of excavation by the police officers, twenty-four bodies were unearthed at the scene. Three people died after being sent to the hospital. Other injured people were sent to Guangci, Zhongshan, Red Cross, Nanyang, and Municipal Eighth Hospital for treatment. Eighty-nine people were recorded, but those who were temporarily bandaged and discharged were not included. Guangci Hospital received the most injured, and Dr. Fu Peibin even voluntarily drew 300 cc of blood to treat a seriously injured refugee, a spirit particularly commendable.

The reporter arrived at the scene at 3:00 PM. Ambulances were still there loading the injured. Only a pile of rubble remained where the houses had collapsed. The lucky survivors sat on top of it, some sighing deeply, some wailing in sorrow over the loss of their parents, children, and siblings, which was heartbreaking to hear.

List of Deaths

The names of the deceased are listed below: Those who died at the scene of the collapse: Gu Kanghe, 60 years old. Wu Youdi, 3 years old. Huang Zhangshi, 40 years old. Feng Didi, 3 years old.

Shen Liushi, 35 years old. Ma Weiqing, 60 years old. All are from Yancheng.

Director of Social Affairs Inquired and Offered Condolences

Wu Kaixian, Director of Social Affairs, rushed to offer condolences yesterday morning after hearing the news and presented 10 million yuan in condolences. In the afternoon, Yuan, the director of the Fourth Bureau, and Sun, the section chief, also went to assist in handling the aftermath and transported some of the injured to the Caohejing Municipal Sixth Hospital for treatment. Regarding future relief measures, the bureau will discuss them today. Gu Zhuxuan and Jin Jiulin, public-spirited gentry from northern Jiangsu in Shanghai, have also scheduled a meeting of the native association today to discuss the aftermath, it is said.

### Adjustment of Public Utility Prices: Bureau of Public Utilities Explains Two Points

The Bureau of Public Utilities is explaining two points for citizens to understand the nature of public utility prices and the difficulties in maintaining the supply of various public utilities, as follows:

(1) Public utility prices are far behind other prices;

The adjustment of public utility prices is calculated based on the index released last month and known prices, so it always lags behind prices. Each time a price is calculated, it is always attempted to be lowered. By lowering prices month after month, it has now fallen far behind general prices. Consider the wholesale price index for the week of June 20-26 compiled by the China General Chamber of Commerce:

Food category: 1,380,174 times

Textiles category: 1,978,946 times

Fuel category: 1,513,975 times

Metals category: 1,964,835 times

Building materials category: 1,845,987 times

Chemicals category: 2,698,621 times

Miscellaneous category: 1,706,206 times

Total index: 1,708,481 times. In the most recent week, each rose by several percent, and the total index should be around 2 million times. The following are the multiples of the new water, electricity, and gas prices for July compared to before the war, as announced yesterday:

Tap Water

Retail: 300,000 times, Ordinary: 825,000 times

Electricity Below 10 degrees: 347,000 times

11 degrees to 30 degrees: 463,000 times

Above 31 degrees: 578,000 times

Users who actually use 20 degrees of electricity only pay 405,000 times, and users who use 30 degrees of electricity only pay 424,000 times.

Gas: 1,000,000 times

Compared to 2 million times for the price of rice, approximately 3 million times for the price of coal, and approximately 2.3 million times for the price of cloth, the smallest is only one-seventh, and the largest is less than one-half.

(2) Public utilities are only allowed to adjust prices once a month, seeking only to barely maintain supply so as not to affect other prices:

The government is very aware of the low purchasing power of ordinary people, so it always tries to reduce the public utility burden on ordinary people as much as possible. The free supply of tap water this time, or the low-priced retail water, and the tiered electricity system are all characteristics of this month's pricing. Each 10 degrees of electricity can power a 25-watt light bulb for 400 hours. Assuming that an ordinary small family uses three 25-watt light bulbs and lights them for 4 hours every day, it only needs 9 degrees a month. That's why we set 10 degrees as the minimum standard. The public utility price standards set last month (June) were based on the assumption that prices would remain stable last month, allowing companies to balance their income and expenses. However, unexpectedly, general prices rose sharply, causing companies to tighten their belts again and again, almost exhausting their resources, and they were still unable to pay the salary increases after the release of the cost-of-living index at the end of the month. They had to be assisted by the government with loans to cope. The prices set this month are based on the same standards as last month, so that they can barely maintain supply and avoid shutdowns. However, since the prices are far below other prices, they cannot be used as an excuse to raise prices. We hope that citizens will understand.

### Zhapu Seaside Bathing Beach Still Retains Primitive Charm: A Weekend Resort for Morning Departure and Evening Return

The Evening Drum and Morning Bell Echo from Xiaoputuo Island; The Paved Roads Offer Magnificent Views

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The Zhapu Seaside Bathing Beach, located ninety kilometers south of Shanghai, has become the only summer resort for Shanghai ladies and gentlemen during weekends. The transportation is convenient, and one can depart in the morning and return in the evening by car.

The seaside bathing area is actually located at the foot of Huangshan Mountain in Huanggu Town, a must-pass on the way to Zhapu. The sandy beach is fine and naturally divided into three parts: west, middle, and east. Its area is larger than that of Repulse Bay in Hong Kong. The only difference is that Repulse Bay has been artificially polished and has modern facilities, while Huangshan Bathing Beach still retains its primitive charm. However, the nearby calm waters and the distant small islands with sailing boats offer the same charm. The beautiful scenery can be called a wonder of Jiangnan. Just as Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Wuxi are suitable for spring and autumn travel, Huangshan Bathing Beach will be the first choice for summer recreation.

Currently, most of those who come to Huangshan Seaside for summer vacation are Russian expatriates. The locals have temporarily built hundreds of thatched huts at the foot of the mountain, renting them out to people who take long-term summer vacations. The price per room ranges from sixty to seventy million to one hundred million yuan. However, the buildings are simple and can only shelter from the wind and rain, but they are interesting enough to broaden the minds of tourists.

The bathing area faces the sacred island of Xiaoputuo, which houses the magnificent Guanyin Temple, hidden in the green trees. Every time the evening drum and morning bell echo with the sound of the blue sea, the mood is clear and the interest is endless.

Yesterday was a weekend holiday, and many people from Shanghai went there for sightseeing. The Russian Expatriate Association prepared four or five large trucks for all-day excursions. Most of the sheds in the bathing area were occupied by Russian expatriates. Being among them is like being in a "Little Russian Village."

Yesterday, our reporter traveled along the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Highway. After traveling 21 kilometers to Minhang, the river ferry has been changed to a flat-decked large iron barge since last year, which can load five or six large trucks or more than ten small cars. A diesel engine is installed on it, making the crossing very convenient. The ferry fee has been adjusted due to the recent soaring prices. It costs 940,000 yuan per trip for trucks and large trucks, 700,000 yuan for small passenger cars with seven seats or less, and 240,000 yuan for motorcycles. After crossing the river, travel another 21 kilometers to Tuolin, 7 kilometers to Caojing, 14 kilometers to Jinshanwei, and 6 kilometers to the Jin Sinang Bridge at the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. After entering Zhejiang, travel 19 kilometers to Huangshan Seaside and 2 kilometers to Zhapu Town. The entire journey takes about three and a half hours by car. The road is very flat, especially the section in Jiangsu Province, which is wider. Two-thirds of the roadbed between Shanghai and Zhapu runs on the seawall, with fields connected on one side and the sound of waves and the shadows of boats on the other, offering beautiful scenery. There are regular long-distance buses from Minhang to Zhapu, running once a day. The buses from Zhapu to Hangzhou depart once a day at 8:30 every morning in both directions. There is another shortcut to Huangshan Bathing Beach from Shanghai: take a train to Jiading, then transfer to a bus via Pinghu to Zhapu.

If Huangshan Bathing Beach can be equipped with modern facilities, it will undoubtedly be the only excellent seawater bathing beach in Jiangnan, comparable to Hong Kong Island in Lingnan and Qingdao in North China.

### The General Labor Union Convenes a Symposium to Review the Direction of the Labor Movement: Labor-Management Cooperation Can Overcome Difficulties

More than 200 people attended, including Shui Xiangyun, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, Fang Rusheng, and Zhang Zhusan, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. Shui Xiangyun and others reported on the details of the negotiations on the cost of living index and the new union fund, and the meeting adjourned at 2:00 pm. The important reports made at yesterday's symposium included: (1) The course of the negotiations on workers' contributions to the new recruits' settlement allowance. The minimum standard remains at five dou of polished rice for able-bodied men and 200,000 yuan for families of soldiers who have not yet been conscripted (reported by Fang Rusheng). (2) The content of the proposals submitted by the labor representatives in the six general meetings of the Senate (reported by Zhou Xuexiang). (3) The course of the request to the municipal authorities to change the cost of living index (reported by Zhang Zhusan). (4) The collection work of the new union fund (reported by Ye Xianggao and Zhou Yunjiang). Finally, the heads of various labor unions enthusiastically reviewed the future direction of the labor movement and unanimously agreed that class confrontation would lead to destruction, and only labor-management cooperation could overcome difficulties.

### Aircraft Fuel is in Short Supply, Vehicle Fueling Volume is Reduced, Gasoline Panic Should Not Reoccur

[Report from Our Newspaper] The gasoline panic in this city last month has become a serious social problem. Now that July has begun, citizens are very concerned about whether the supply and demand of gasoline can be balanced. When interviewed by a reporter yesterday, a person in charge of a gasoline company believed that a panic should not occur this month. The gasoline import quota for this month is still 1.5 million gallons, the same as last month. However, in terms of distribution, the authorities will reduce unnecessary consumption. For example, the allowable refueling volume for small cars has been reduced by 20%, and the allowable refueling volume for large trucks has been reduced by 30%. Therefore, although the supply volume for this month is the same as last month, the demand volume has relatively decreased. Rationally speaking, the situation of last month should not occur again. As for aviation gasoline, although the current selling price is as high as 1,587,000 yuan per gallon, recently, companies such as China National Aviation Corporation have reduced the number of domestic flights, and the demand has decreased. A monthly supply of 3.78 million gallons is sufficient to meet the needs of the three institutions: the Central Government of China, the Civil Aviation Administration, and the Air Force. Although a portion of this amount was withdrawn last month, the current inventory can at least last for two weeks. At the same time, the Import and Export Committee has approved an additional import of aviation gasoline, so the Civil Aviation Administration can definitely maintain its operations without worry.

### Suspicious Case of Ren Gui'e's Sudden Death; Her Brother Sends a Letter Certifying That It Was Not Suicide; Claims That There Was No Ghostly Haunting or Mental Disorder

[Report from Our Newspaper] In the case of the tragic death of Yu Hang woman Ren Gui'e after her marriage, the District Prosecutor's Office has filed a public prosecution against Ren's husband, Ruan Bingfa, and others on suspicion of aiding and abetting suicide. Now, according to a letter from Ren's brother, Benyuan, from Yu Hang: "My sister, Ren Gui'e, married Ruan Bingfa in Hangzhou on April 11. On the 14th, I accompanied her to Shanghai. I stayed at Ruan's house for six days and only returned home on the 19th. On the night of the 21st, she swallowed a gold ring. Calculating the days, my sister was alone in Shanghai for only two days after her marriage. The so-called ghostly haunting and mental disorder, I accompanied her for six days, and there was no such thing. Swallowing a gold ring, according to a letter from Ruan Bingfa, was forced by a woman to swallow (the original letter was submitted to the District Prosecutor's Office), so it was not suicide. Moreover, suicide must have a reason. My sister's engagement and marriage were both voluntary. She had been newly married for half a month and had no stimulation. Since the swallowing of gold was forced, fortunately, she did not die. Why would she cut her throat with scissors again? In addition, there was a cloth strap around her neck, and her clothes were neat. Moreover, Ruan and others confessed to the police station that my sister requested to call the police after swallowing gold but was prevented from doing so, and other suspicious points, there are many other reasons why it was not suicide, which are all detailed in the complaint," and so on.

### July Coal Price Approved and Announced Yesterday; Average Increase of 160%

[Report from Our Newspaper] The new coal price for July, which has been brewing for many days, was finally officially announced by the government yesterday. The new price is an average increase of 160% compared to the coal price in June. According to Mr. Zhang Xiwei, chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, in an interview with a reporter from this newspaper, the price increase was unavoidable. He had been running around and negotiating for many days for this matter before making the final decision to increase the price. He only returned to Shanghai from Nanjing today (the 4th). The new price is still half the price of coal on the black market. It has been learned that the new price of various grades of coal in July is as follows: (The following prices are per ton, in thousands of yuan)

(A) Public utilities, delivery at the dock: 31,784 yuan. Delivery by the entire ship: 31,184 yuan.

(B) Railways, military transport, navy, dredging wharf delivery: 32,984 yuan.

(C) Power plants, ships, and traffic structures under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Public Works Bureau in other ports: 32,784 yuan. No. 2 slack: 32,984 yuan. Mixed: 33,184 yuan. No. 1 slack: 33,384 yuan. No. 2 lump: 33,684 yuan. Mixed lump: 33,984 yuan. Train lump: 34,284 yuan. No. 21 screened lump: 34,584 yuan. Mixed screened lump: 34,884 yuan.

(D) Factories and military and government agencies: Jilong slack: 36,384 yuan. No. 2 slack: 36,584 yuan. Mixed slack: 36,784 yuan. No. 1 slack: 36,984 yuan. No. 2 lump: 37,284 yuan. Mixed lump: 37,584 yuan. Train lump: 37,884 yuan. No. 2 screened lump: 38,184 yuan. Mixed screened lump: 38,484 yuan.

(F) White coal: Great Wall slack: 16,692 yuan. Great Wall block: 23,218 yuan. Other coal slack: 26,0116 yuan. Other small pieces: 30,602 yuan. Other screened block: 46,150 yuan. The prices of coal in groups C, D, E, and F are all for delivery at the Pudong wharf. Delivery at the Mai Gen Road warehouse is subject to an additional 2.4 million yuan per ton.

Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee Explains the Reasons for the Unavoidable Adjustment

Mr. Zhang Xiwei also issued a written explanation of the new prices for the amount of coal in July, as follows: "The coal price has been maintained for one month since June 1 and has not been adjusted. However, since mid-June, various commodity prices and the cost of living index have all risen sharply. If the coal price is not adjusted again, not only will the mines be unable to produce, but also the work of transportation and shipping will be suspended. For example, the delivery price of coal in Qinhuangdao in June was 6,778,000 yuan per ton. After deducting the railway freight from the mining area to the port of 1,220,000 yuan (using coal to pay for transportation), calculated at the current exchange rate, it is only equivalent to more than 2 US dollars per ton. Calculated at the black market US dollar, it is only worth more than 1 US dollar. Even calculated at the flour price at the end of June, one ton of coal can only be exchanged for more than one bag of flour. It is difficult to continue production without adjustment. Furthermore, in terms of the allocation price of our association in June, the allocation price for public utilities was 12,255,000 yuan. In addition to the mine price of 6,778,000 yuan, the remaining expenses such as shipping fees, insurance fees, and loading and unloading labor must also be adjusted in order to be handled. After the mine price is adjusted, the North China Self-Defense Special Donation and stamp duty will also increase accordingly. The general freight rate from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai has risen to more than 7.3 million yuan per ton, so the fuel transportation cost cannot but be increased to 5 million yuan per ton. The dock workers, due to the sharp increase in prices, have demanded a salary increase and have repeatedly threatened to strike, all of which have been prevented through various means. However, since the cost of living index for workers has increased, wages cannot but be increased. Therefore, the fuel allocation price cannot but be raised. However, if the price after adjustment is compared to the price of one ton of fuel oil to two tons of coal, the coal price is still much lower than the oil price. If compared to foreign coal, it is even lower. Because the import of foreign coal, plus tariffs, requires a price of more than 30 US dollars, or more than 70 million legal tender per ton. Therefore, it is hoped that all departments under control can increase production, the Beijing-Hankou Railway can be repaired as soon as possible, and Kai Luan coal can be shipped south in a continuous stream to supply the needs of the Beijing-Shanghai area."

More Than 8,000 Tons of Taiwanese Coal Shipped to Shanghai

Amid increasing shipments of Taiwanese coal to Shanghai, another 8,500 tons arrived in Shanghai yesterday to supply the market. The Fuel Management Committee has dispatched personnel to receive and unload the goods. It is said that more than 100,000 tons can still be shipped in this month.

Assisting Coal Mines to Increase Production, Loans of 800 Billion Yuan to be Approved

The Four Joint Offices has approved loans totaling 817 billion yuan to the five coal mines of Central China, East China, Huainan, Zhongxing, Jiangnan, and Hunan, including 600 billion yuan for construction loans, 105 billion yuan for coal purchase loans, and 112 billion yuan for working capital loans. Among them, East China Coal Mine accounts for 70 billion yuan, Huainan Coal Mine accounts for 600 billion yuan, Zhongxing Coal Mine accounts for 100 billion yuan, Jiangnan Coal Mine accounts for 115 billion yuan, and Hunan Coal Mine accounts for 22 billion yuan, which will be lent by China Communications Bank.

### Young General Ma Jiyuan

— Our Reporter Zhang Xianzhou

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 1st dispatch] Wherever our reporter went in eastern Gansu, the people, upon hearing the name of the 82nd Division, would almost immediately show friendliness and joy. When Ma Jiyuan was mentioned, they would unanimously recommend him to you, recounting the merits of Commander Ma. They said that the people and the military were truly cooperative. When the discipline of the troops was mentioned, they all said: "This army is good. They buy and sell fairly, don't live in civilian houses, and don't disturb the people." Ma Jiyuan is not a legendary hero. He is a twenty-eight-year-old young general. He is the only son of Qinghai Chairman Ma Bufang. From the first page of his life story until now, everything has gone smoothly. In China's Northwest, many people knew him as early as ten years ago, but it was only after the great victory in eastern Gansu this time that his fame spread throughout the country, and he gained attention.

1944 was a major turning point in his life. A young gentleman who had lived in the Northwest for a long time graduated for the first time from the first class of the Senior Officer Class of the Army University in Chongqing. This was a period of gestation for his future career and a new starting point for his later path. His classmates at the time included Song Xilian, Fan Hanjie, Huang Zhao, and Zhao Shoushan, the current "Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Northwest People's Liberation Army" of the Communist bandits. According to himself, he was the worst student in that class. After graduating from the Army University, he returned to his troops and began to reform the small matters in the army.

On May 23rd, when the reporter visited his headquarters for the first time, he greeted everyone and led them to his office to sit down. It was a large room, with military maps and banners of Yu Ranweng hanging on the four walls, creating an elegant atmosphere. Among them were interspersed several small pieces of paper, written in Song-style type with Western maxims, such as "Genius never despises labor! - Stevens." There were several reports on the desk, along with two or three copies of Silren Screen, all of which fully demonstrated the owner's deep love for Western flavor. In that courtesy visit, although it only lasted a few tens of minutes, everyone talked very harmoniously. He was wearing a yellow wool military uniform and spoke with a strong Gansu accent.

The next afternoon, he chatted with everyone. According to himself, he liked riding horses and hunting. In the past, he was very fond of reading Turgenev's novels, but now his interest has shifted to the nation! He is a movie enthusiast. He said that he hadn't seen a movie for a long time. When he was in Chongqing, he could watch three movies a day. At the same time, he loves to sing, and every night after planning operations, he and his senior subordinates would sing loudly. He can sing Western songs and loves to dance local dances. What makes him love these things? It should be the aristocratic life of his childhood and the ethnicity of the Hui people. When talking about his family life, he laughed. His wives currently live in Xining. The first wife is his cousin, the direct younger sister of Commander Ma of a certain cavalry unit stationed in Xinjiang. They were engaged as children, arranged by their parents. She cannot read. Ma Jiyuan said with a smile: "Once, I sent her a letter asking why she didn't write back. As a result, the reply came with writing on the envelope and the stationery blank, with only a stamp on the lower left corner." When he was in Chongqing, he fell in love with Zhang Xunfen, a female staff member of the Foreign Exchange Management Committee, and later married her. Mrs. Zhang is from Nanjing and graduated from Huiwen Girls' High School. She also lives in Xining now. The reporter asked him which one he loved. He said, "I love them both." Another reporter probed from the side, asking him which boudoir he would go to first when he went home. He cleverly said: "I go to my mother first, because they are both there." This made everyone laugh. "Nine out of ten officials are afraid of their wives," he continued. "I also listen to my wife. For example, a month ago, I suddenly thought I should grow a mustache, so I grew a small 'eight' character mustache. I wrote a letter to Mrs. Zhang, with a small photo attached as proof. My wife immediately issued a 'decree', disagreeing with this matter, so I obeyed and shaved it off, and became younger again."

He said that he liked the United States, supported the People's Livelihood, hated the Soviet Union, and believed that one day the Soviet Union would fight with the United States. He agreed with a foreign colleague's question that "as long as there are humans, there will be war."

The victory in eastern Gansu was because the Communist bandits, after their defeat in Lingshan, wanted to return north and defeat Ma's troops to cover up their defeat. Ma Jiyuan could not deny that if it were not for General Hu Zongnan's troops pursuing north, he would have suffered even greater losses, but if eastern Gansu had not been blocked by them, the Communist bandits would have escaped even more.

The 82nd Division of the National Army was trained and cultivated by Ma Bufang. For more than ten years, it has been famous in the Northwest. In 1935, it eliminated more than 40,000 Communist bandits and shattered Xu Xiangqian's "international line" breakthrough. When Ma Jiyuan was 21 years old, he took over his father's mantle as commander of the army. After the victory, he was ordered to reorganize, and he was changed from army commander to division commander. Other than the name change, the original people and horses remained the same. Not only was the medicine not changed, but even the soup probably wasn't changed either.

### Funds for the Third Phase of the Shanghai-Suzhou Seawall Project Have Been Allocated

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 3rd dispatch] The Shanghai-Suzhou Seawall Project should proceed with the third phase of its plan this year, totaling 706 meters in length. According to news from Su Jianying: After the first batch of 30 billion yuan was allocated in May, a contract was signed with the Fuji Construction Company to purchase materials. The second batch of 70 billion yuan was allocated to Shanghai by US Aid to China in June, and the Songjiang and Taicang sections of the project are currently being planned. The third batch of 130 billion yuan is currently being negotiated. Dong Zanyao, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, went to Baoshan and other sections to inspect and returned to Zhenjiang on the 2nd. According to him, "The progress of the project is difficult to control due to price fluctuations. We are currently trying to use the estimated number of workdays as a standard and allocate funds according to actual needs."

### Iron-Fisted Politics in Zhejiang: From Shen Cheng-zhang to Chen Gong-qia

— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 3rd dispatch] In May in Jiangnan, pomegranate flowers are like fire, and as we move towards the height of summer, the resignation of Zhejiang Provincial Government Chairman Shen Cheng-zhang and the appointment of Chen Gong-qia have brought a sense of seeing off the old and welcoming the new.

Recalling Mr. Shen's words to reporters on the eve of his assumption of office: "Zhejiang is a healthy province, and everything is on track, so it is relatively easy to govern." However, after more than two years in Zhejiang, Mr. Shen developed the intention to resign. He once told reporters: "I used to like to drink wine, but now I don't drink it. I used to like to smoke, but now I don't smoke it. Lately, I haven't even been able to sleep well, and I know that my humble body is declining." When Mr. Shen took office, he also told reporters: "I am already over sixty years old, and President Chiang has asked me to govern his hometown. I can only do my best to repay his kindness."

During his time in Zhejiang, Mr. Shen himself could truly be described as "diligent in government." Immediately after arriving, he went to inspect the seawall, and afterwards, he kept running around in various counties, leaving his footprints in almost every county. Even though the roads were dilapidated, he still bumped along in a ten-wheeled truck. Upon arriving in each county, he inspected various agencies, held symposiums, and only went to sleep at 2 a.m., and then got up again at 7 a.m. to work. Such spirit, at his current age of sixty-six, is truly commendable.

Mr. Shen's work focus seemed to be to give universal attention to every cause. For example, in terms of governance, he advocated abolishing harsh taxes and levies and not entertaining superiors and foreign guests. Even when he himself inspected a county, he would pay for his own meals. As for construction, the seawall was repaired, farmland irrigation was carried out, and afforestation and production were all proceeding steadily. As for security, the defense zones of the provincial security teams were stipulated, and Siming and other places were designated as pacification zones. The county magistrates of the pacification zones were convened to plan security work. As for personnel, talent was trained by the provincial cadre training corps, and county magistrates were examined and registered. Regarding finance and land tax, he requested the central government to reduce the tax rate and strove to increase funding. He also paid attention to education, preventing student unrest, and giving speeches to students everywhere. As for the treatment of county-level public education personnel, he raised it to the level of issuing supplies and stipulating basic salaries for civil servants. During his tenure, his

most notable achievement was in farmland irrigation in the construction field. At that time, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration happened to have a branch office in Zhejiang, and Mr. Shen traveled everywhere, inspecting counties that needed irrigation construction. The two sides cooperated, using flour as work relief, and indeed did a lot of work. As for the criticisms that Mr. Shen received, they mainly concerned the issue of security. Because when Mr. Shen took office, the security situation did not feel serious, but today, many threats are felt. Therefore, it is said that Mr. Shen was questioned by many fellow villagers when he was in Nanjing.

In fact, the issue of security is related to the entire political issue. Because the entire political system has not come up with a way to cut through the Gordian knot, and coupled with rising prices and the difficulty of people's livelihoods, even a small spark will inevitably start a prairie fire if it is slightly incited. Therefore, if people in these relatively difficult and insecure places can be given a stable livelihood, their hearts will naturally be disgusted by chaos. I feel that it is somewhat unfair to criticize Mr. Shen for not putting in enough effort to maintain security. I believe that Mr. Shen's failure lies in giving universal attention to every cause and doing everything himself. Because he paid attention to every cause, he lacked a special solution to a specific problem. Because he did everything himself, his energy was limited, which made him feel tired and exhausted, and when a person is tired and exhausted, he only has the power to drag on. Some people say that Mr. Shen appointed many private individuals when he came to Zhejiang. I feel that this statement is also an exaggeration. After Mr. Shen took office, several provincial committee members did not cooperate and rushed to Nanjing to lobby, which eventually formed the provincial government. At the same time, among the county magistrates in the province, there were really only a small number of Mr. Shen's private individuals. Mr. Shen wanted to make a difference in Zhejiang and wanted to do things in a good direction, so he did not want to offend anyone and always tried to make everyone happy. The problem also lies in this point, because in trying not to offend anyone, he ended up offending people. Many people felt that during Mr. Shen's two years of governing Zhejiang, they did not feel his good points, nor did they feel his bad points.

Now, Mr. Chen Gongxia has come. After taking office, Mr. Chen told reporters that he would pay special attention to security and production. Among security and production, he seemed particularly interested in the latter and had a

beautiful vision, that is, the success of the hydropower station at the street entrance, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway running from Jinhua to Wenzhou, and the formal navigation of the Qiantang River, which would definitely change the economic situation. Indeed, today when we talk about security, if we just rely on military force to win, it is really passive. We should develop economic undertakings and enrich people's livelihoods, so that everyone has food to eat and clothes to wear, which is considered active security work. Now, the hydropower generation, the opening of the Qiantang River, and the connection of the Jin-Wen Railway listed by Mr. Chen all have concrete prototypes. As long as we persevere and work hard, we can certainly succeed. However, to succeed in the above-mentioned undertakings, a large amount of money and manpower are needed. Mr. Chen once stated that after arriving in Zhejiang, he would requisition idle labor and idle capital, which is certainly welcomed by the general public, because reducing idle labor reduces consumption, and reducing idle capital indirectly suppresses prices. However, today, most of the people with idle labor and idle capital are wealthy and powerful, and the real ordinary people, such as the farmers in rural areas, have already reached the point of contributing money and labor. If Mr. Chen wants to requisition idle labor and idle capital, will it cause resentment among some wealthy and powerful people? We have always admired Mr. Chen's iron-fisted politics, and once he has made a decision, he will implement it earnestly, regardless of all difficulties, and must carry it through to the end. We eagerly look forward to the new chairman using the means of cutting through the Gordian knot to do something practical, so that Zhejiang can truly achieve a day of "peace and order."

### The Level of Domestic Films Has Improved, and They May Compete for Overseas Markets

[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong, 2nd Dispatch] King's Theater in Hong Kong, which specializes in premiering first-run films, has since yesterday hung a 24-inch large color photo of the domestic costume film "National Soul" in a location that dwarfs the display of foreign film stills, in its most eye-catching corridor, with a notice that it will soon be shown at the theater, which has aroused the interest of Chinese and Western people here. According to observations by people in the film industry: It is believed that Chinese films may soon rise in the international market. The question is whether the technical level of domestic films can rival Hollywood productions, and the Yonghua Film Company, which produced "National Soul," seems to have the above basic conditions.

Unable to catch up, they fired warning shots, hitting vital points and killing them on the spot.

### Bloodshed in Shenyang: Unexpected Disaster at an Engagement Feast, Suspicions of Revenge Killing and Love Killing

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 30th Dispatch] There have been many murders in Panyang recently, which indicates that the psychology of young men and women is developing in a distorted direction. At about 2:00 p.m. today, a confusing murder case occurred at the Taifeng Restaurant in the northern city. The female protagonist was Qiu Xiqing, a nineteen-year-old village girl with a lovely appearance. A grenade exploded at her engagement feast. She was originally scheduled to get married this Sunday. This was a nightmare she had never dreamed of. At a table of banquets, life developed to the extreme highs of comedy and tragedy.

The murderer was a soldier in his twenties, with long hair and a pale face. After killing the people, he committed suicide with a grenade, his lungs spilling out, blood and flesh flying everywhere. He died in this heroic manner. They all died blindly. When the reporter squeezed into the crowd to watch this tragedy, he only saw the four corpses covered in blood and flesh. The expressions of the people in the front row were very solemn. This is the symbol of humanity. After the so-called "life" storm, everything returns to stillness and silence.

This bizarre story took place on a rainy noon. A soldier customer came to Taifeng Restaurant, went upstairs and entered seat number four, ordered a plate of cold dishes and a doubt of white wine, and drank alone. Then he asked for fine wine and dishes, as if to relieve his sorrow. At about 1:00 p.m., he called the waiter and said that he was going to catch the 3:00 train and was going elsewhere. He was taking a nap now and asked the waiter to wake him up when the time came. Then he seemed to fall asleep.

Originally, in seats number two and three of the restaurant, Liu Hanwen (27 years old, from Jinzhou), a major director of the health team of the Second Regiment of the Northeast Garrison Command stationed in Fushun, and Qiu Xiqing (19 years old), a woman from Wujiabao Village, Shahe Township, were holding an engagement ceremony. More than a dozen relatives from both sides were present. Unexpectedly, after the banquet had just begun, a sudden disaster occurred. The soldier in the next seat threw a grenade in from the door with a loud bang, and gunpowder smoke flew everywhere. The soldier returned to his seat and blew himself up.

After the incident, the owner of the restaurant rushed to report to the police. After the police arrived, they immediately handled the aftermath and began to investigate the land court inspection office, which also sent prosecutors and forensic doctors to investigate. It was determined that the deceased were Qiu Xiqing (female), Wang Fugui (the woman's sister's husband), Tian Ziwen, Liu Hanwen's orderly, and the murderer. The injured included the matchmaker Wu Wang Rulan (female), Liu Hanwen, and Xu Encai (waiter at Taifeng Restaurant), all of whom were injured in their arms and legs. They were slightly injured and have been sent to the hospital.

The circumstances of this case seem to be a case of jealousy or revenge killing. It is said that there was another engagement banquet at Taifeng Restaurant that day, and the murderer was intoxicated and confused, and it is also possible that he killed the wrong people. However, the murdering soldier was not wearing any insignia, so there is no way to know which unit he belonged to and his name, making it difficult to find clues. It is said that when the woman was in her hometown, troops were stationed in her home, revealing a clue, which seems to be a love affair.

The woman's father, Qiu Wenhan, is an honest villager. After this tragedy, he has lost his mind, but he repeatedly said that his daughter was very well-behaved and had no improper affairs before her death. When the forensic doctor determined that the girl was no longer a virgin, the old man from the countryside firmly denied it, but in his distraught eyes, he revealed a grief more shameful than the death of his daughter.

### Soldiers in Shangrao Steal Guns, and the Entire Case Is Transferred to the Security Department for Interrogation

[Our Newspaper, Shangrao, 2nd Dispatch] A case of soldiers stealing guns from our army to aid bandits occurred in this county in the middle of last month.

On the 18th, Wu Guangmei, the transport platoon leader of the division, discovered the theft and reported it to the Shangrao Military Police. Later, when Platoon Leader Wu counted the number of people, he found that squad foot Liu Guihua was out and had not returned, so he was highly suspected. After interrogation, Liu confessed that he was used by the bandit Zhou Yishui and successively stole and sold guns and magazines, hiding them at Ying Zuguo's place. Personnel were dispatched to search Ying's home, and the entire case has been sent to the Security Command for handling.

### Changzhou Grain Administration: A Complete Mess, Many Loopholes

[Our Correspondent in Wujin, 2nd] In the past, the collection of land taxes in kind was like a "riddle" to the general public. Warehouse losses, storage losses, transportation losses, leakage losses, boat losses... countless unclear "losses," long-distance freight, short-distance freight, processing rates, leftover rice from processing, concentrated warehouse varieties of japonica, indica, and inferior rice, red-spotted rice, moldy grains, upper and lower grades, sacks, grain strings, settlement slips, so much trouble that it made everyone's head spin!

Changzhou, after suffering painful lessons, was unwilling to leave this "riddle" unsolved. Therefore, public opinion took notice, and the assembly specially organized an investigation committee. After three or four months of extensive inquiry, they finally cut open this mysterious tumor. Upon inspection, to everyone's surprise, it was full of rotten things—truly a complete mess!

First Investigation: Seeking Pearls in the Abyss. First, it was discovered that Lu Pinjin, secretary of the County Land and Grain Office and chief of the Third Section, had taken advantage of his position and his personal relationship with County Magistrate Weng Cheng to secretly instruct warehouse managers to transport over 4,400 *shi* of grain to the Taiheng Grain Store in Wuxi for processing. It was stipulated that each *shi* of 108 *jin* would yield 82 *jin* of rice, equivalent to 5 *dou* 4 *sheng* and 7 *he*. Ostensibly, the Changzhou Revitalization Association would handle the accounting. When the case was uncovered, 200 packages of brown japonica rice and over 930 packages of white japonica rice had already been shipped out, reportedly to be sold on the market for profit. This was completely illegal. After being reported, the Provincial Land and Grain Office also sent personnel to investigate and confirm the facts. Lu Pinjin and some transport staff were subsequently imprisoned. The main culprit, Lu Pinjin, relied on former County Magistrate Weng Cheng's intercession, falsely claiming he was released on bail to handle the handover. After being released, he fled without a trace, now implicating his guarantors. The case is still awaiting trial by the court. The general public believes that China's legal system is not strong enough and that "officials protect each other," so there will be no result. The matter had just begun, and the public already sensed a feeling of disappointment that it would be "much ado about nothing." However, this Lu Pinjin had followed Weng Cheng for eight or nine years, specializing in grain administration and understanding its intricacies, mastering all the ins and outs. This time in Changzhou, he intended to "deceive the heavens and cross the sea," but unexpectedly failed halfway. Once the matter was discovered, he cleverly shifted the responsibility to the clerks to evade punishment. Weng Cheng even spoke up for him, claiming he was wronged, but with incriminating evidence in hand, the facts were clear, and there was no room for sophistry. He had no choice but to take "the thirty-sixth stratagem: running is the best option." The assembly decided to conduct further investigation. Unfortunately for Lu Pinjin, he failed this time.

Secondly, Shou Xuefan, an employee of the Caoqiao Office, also brought in by County Magistrate Weng, transported grain to the city and delivered it to the Jinfeng Rice Mill, totaling over 1,400 *shi*.

The grain delivered by the villagers was all japonica rice, but when recorded at the mill, it was all changed to indica rice. At that time, the market price of japonica rice was higher, and indica rice was cheaper, with a difference of over 100,000 yuan per *shi*. It was easy to embezzle hundreds of millions of yuan. At the same time, Shou, a young man, was extravagant and wasteful. Taking advantage of his position, he also misappropriated over 200 *shi* of grain. After the incident, Shou was once detained but subsequently escaped while being transferred to the court. This case also awaits court trial. This explains many things: (1) The Land and Grain Office and its offices insisted that the villagers deliver as much japonica rice as possible, and the exchange of japonica and indica rice resulted in a significant amount, considering the total of hundreds of thousands of *shi* in the county. (2) Regardless of whether it was japonica or indica, the quality required from the villagers was uniformly high. Furthermore, superior quality grain was transformed into inferior broken rice with red spots, with a price difference of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan per *shi*. This manipulation was also a major source of profit. But in the end, rice was still rice, and the number of *dan* was still the number of *dan*, so there was no problem in official records. The unlucky one was Shou Xuefan, who was reported.

The problems with processing factories and designated warehouses were also serious. There were over twenty designated warehouses in Changzhou, including Tongren, Yuanfeng, Dafeng, Tianfeng, Hengfeng, Yang Dasheng, Yuyuan Cheng, and the Revitalization Association. Recently, it was discovered that Tianfeng and Hengfeng factories had misappropriated a total of 4,600 to 4,700 *shi* of grain. Dai Xueyu, the manager of Tianfeng, engaged in purely empty buying and selling, colluding with

grain official Lu Pinjin to use grain to establish Tianfeng Factory, to operate Yunfei Transportation Company, and to open Tianfengxiang Grain Store in Wuxi. After all this, he ran into bad luck, losing over 2,500 *shi* of grain. He is now imprisoned and has agreed to declare bankruptcy and compensate. This matter is certainly extensive, and the military law office is still continuing its investigation. Similarly, Hengfeng Factory misappropriated 1,200 *shi*, which has been confirmed. Jin Zhenyi, the person in charge, has been released on bail pending trial. He claims to have made up for the losses. Whether or not he has actually made up for them remains to be seen after the factory is audited. Whether other factories have misappropriated grain has not been investigated in detail, but at the very least, they have likely used it.

Secondly, the processing rate and leftover rice were also shrouded in darkness. According to regulations, each *shi* of 108 *jin* of grain should yield at least 5 *dou* and 2 *sheng* of rice. Using rice husks and broken rice as processing costs and short-distance transportation fees, according to general practice, 108 *jin* of grain should yield 5 *dou* and 4 or 5 *sheng* of rice. Apart from the regulated 5 *dou* and 2 *sheng*, at least 2 or 3 *sheng* of leftover rice could be obtained from each *shi* of grain. For the processing of hundreds of thousands of *shi*, this leftover rice would amount to thousands of *shi*, which is not a small amount. However, with officials, clerks, merchants, and evil people colluding with each other, they publicly declared that only 5 *dou* and 2 *sheng* were obtained. According to statistics, the leftover rice from processing in Changzhou in the 35th and 36th years was at least 10,000 *shi*. At a value of 15 million yuan per *shi*, the amount would be 150 billion yuan. This was the hard-earned money of countless people, all of which was embezzled. Who embezzled it? Of course, it involved a wide range of people, and everyone involved in grain administration was inevitably implicated in the corruption.

The people suffered greatly when paying land taxes in kind. The tax collectors were as urgent as fire, and when necessary, certain teams would be dispatched to assist.

The grain delivered had to be dry, full, and of good quality. If there was even a little sand, mud, or empty shells, there was no room for leniency. When weighing, the steelyard beam had to be lifted like a dragonfly's tail, with a floating weight of one or two *jin*, which was difficult to detect. In addition, there was an open increase of seven or eight *jin* or five or six *jin* per *shi*. If paying in cash, in addition to the market price of good grain, one had to add the equivalent of five or six *jin* or seven or eight *jin* of grain. And one had to deliver it to the designated concentration warehouse, where they would be harshly exploited, demanding endlessly, engaging in the most greedy corruption. Last winter, a villager in Changzhou encountered

the most tragic experience. He carried a *shi* of grain from Benniu to the city, but the office was closed, and they refused to accept it. The villager, having no relatives in the city and no money on him, had no choice but to guard his load of grain at the warehouse door, enduring hunger and cold, and freezing through the harsh winter night. Returning home the next day, he eventually succumbed to his injuries and died, leaving behind his wife and daughter! Can you not feel anything? In addition, there are countless other stories of blood and tears, all produced by this flawed policy of collecting taxes in kind, which cannot all be enumerated. Selling land to pay grain taxes is heard everywhere, which is truly unbearable to listen to.

The current grain administration has too many loopholes! For example, local county-level grain taxes are purchased at low prices, without any regard for fairness, with prices less than one-fifth of the market price. County-level grain taxes are bought up cheaply, disregarding the county's finances. In general, county expenses in southern Jiangsu are empty in June, July, August, and September. The people are impoverished, and the county is broke, but the suppression of rebellion and nation-building must be done. However, because there is no money, everything is deflated. Regarding the collection of land taxes in kind, the regulations for transportation fees are unreasonable. For example, in the 36th year, the transportation fee was only a few thousand yuan per *shi*. How could anyone be asked to transport grain for that amount? Storage losses, warehouse losses, transportation losses—everything should have an accurate statistical accounting to allow for reasonable, legal, and fair scientific management. Unfortunately, the grain administration authorities have no correct instructions, relying only on orders to do this and that. In many places, it is impossible for lower-level staff not to engage in corruption! How can this be?

The collection of taxes in kind for the 37th year is about to begin. If the system is not thoroughly reformed and innovation is not vigorously pursued, and everything remains the same as before, then, of course, many grain officials and tax clerks will be smirking, welcoming this opportunity to get rich, and many grain merchants will be laughing, brandishing their claws and teeth, taking the opportunity to collude and profit from this money-making business. The poor people will tremble again! In our opinion, generally speaking, today's grain administration is too difficult, with corruption at every level and problems at every stage. The corruption and problems are linked together. The current stage of grain administration is simply a large-scale experimental ground for corruption and bribery. How many people today can withstand the test? If the government does not actively correct this, it will be no different from driving countless officials, clerks, merchants, and people into the deep pit of corruption and bribery! The result will not only be that the future of grain administration is unthinkable, but also that the urgent tasks of suppressing rebellion and nation-building, and democratic constitutionalism, may not have anything worth writing about.

### General Prices: Deepening Economic Crisis; Authorities Striving to Salvage

The great price surge of June was like a storm, continuing for four weeks. As of last week, it seemed to have temporarily paused. According to analysis, this was due to the following factors: (1) After the continuous sharp rise in prices, speculative funds were frozen in goods, and holders were unwilling to sell, preventing speculative funds from moving; (2) Prices in other cities also rose too sharply, speculative funds were absorbed by goods, and the source was reduced; (3) North China restricted the exchange of circulating certificates, reducing the flow of funds to the south.

Last week, as it was the end of June, and July 1st and 2nd were the periods for the semi-annual final settlement of accounts for all banks and firms, funds had to be balanced. Most major commodities lacked a market, so the entire market, except for the stock market which opened on the 3rd with "a sea of red," was relatively quiet and not much to mention. However, with the continuous inflation of currency and the deepening economic crisis, everyone was worried about the price trends after the "red opening" at the end of the week.

The authorities were alarmed by this round of price frenzy. The important measures that can be mentioned are as follows:

First, the Control Yuan, feeling that the rising prices needed to be stopped urgently, submitted a price correction proposal to the Executive Yuan on June 16th. By last week, the Executive Yuan responded, listing stabilization measures:

(1) Strengthening financial controls to prevent the indiscriminate issuance of promissory notes, so as to avoid credit expansion and stimulate prices.

(2) Promoting the sale of treasury bonds to tighten credit.

(3) Dispatching responsible personnel to North China to improve exchange methods, and selling materials in North China. Also, the Ministry of Food was ordered to issue emergency measures for adjusting food supplies, ordering foreign rice, and continuing to hold urban food rationing to stabilize public sentiment.

These few measures are just rehashes of old ideas, and do not offer any new solutions to the current price problem.

Second, on Tuesday, Deputy Executive Yuan President Zhang said: "The government's price controls are currently managed separately by relevant ministries based on their respective responsibilities, such as the Flower Control Committee and the Financial Control Bureau. Now, the government, in view of the severe price fluctuations, has ordered all relevant departments to strengthen the implementation of the original methods of control, and to submit detailed opinions, so that the Executive Yuan can coordinate and implement comprehensive controls at any time." Later, it was reported that President Weng had drafted concrete measures to stabilize prices and would present a report at a secret meeting of the Legislative Yuan at the end of the week. How the price problem, which seems to have reached a dead end, will be resolved remains to be seen with the implementation of the new measures! Third, the Shanghai authorities, in response to the rising prices, convened a meeting at the municipal government on the 26th and announced four emergency measures to be implemented immediately: (1) The trade associations for daily necessities such as food, cotton, yarn, edible oil, fuel, paper, and sugar in the city were ordered to report to the Social Affairs Bureau within three days on the transaction situation of their member merchants from the 15th of this month to the date of the report, including the quantity traded, the names of the buyers or merchants, and the prices, for verification.

(2) The trade association for warehouse and godown businesses in the city was ordered to report the names of the owners, quantities, and storage dates of the grain warehouses storing daily necessities. The municipal government will conduct thorough investigations, and those who operate outside the industry and store goods beyond the government's prescribed time will be severely punished.

(3) The Financial Management Bureau was ordered to convene the municipal government, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Police Bureau, the Audit Office of the Central Bank, etc., to thoroughly investigate the origins and destinations of bills and notes at the clearing house and various banks and firms. Those who use funds to hoard, speculate, or manipulate the market, or misappropriate public funds, will be severely punished.

(4) The city has a cotton reserve of 150,000 bales, including 57,000 bales held by the Textile Export Committee and 90,000 bales of US aid materials. The city is currently consulting with the Export Committee and plans to allocate this batch of cotton. Efforts are also being made to use the US aid portion, so the current cotton panic can be alleviated. After this decision, it has been gradually implemented. What the results will be remains to be proven by the facts.

Fourth, the authorities' policy of selling materials in the past has mostly been concentrated in Shanghai. Starting last week, the authorities sold over 1,800 bags of flour for the first time in Tianjin, priced at 6.5 million to 9.4 million yuan per bag, and sold over 2,000 *jin* of Hankou rice. They continued to sell afterwards. It is said that by the end of the week, a total of 7,000 bags of flour had been sold. Selling materials naturally has a decisive effect on stabilizing prices, but based on the experience of selling in Shanghai, if one cannot control sufficient quantities of goods, set stable prices, and furthermore, if the techniques used are improper, it may instead induce speculators and contribute to rising prices. This is something that should be considered when selling materials in other cities.

Fifth, in order to prevent prices from rising again after the "red opening" on the 3rd, the Shanghai authorities convened a meeting on Friday by the commander of the garrison department, inviting the heads of the municipal government, military, police, and financial institutions, to discuss and decide on five emergency measures:

(1) Controlling currency and tightening credit, the main points of which are to limit the amount of cash each person can bring to Shanghai to no more than 200 million yuan, and to suggest that the Central Bank restrict withdrawals and deposits.

(2) Controlling prices and searching for hoarded goods, setting a deadline for registering inventory and inspecting warehouses.

(3) Public sale of food to stabilize rice prices, accelerating preparations for public food expenses and implementing comprehensive rationing.

(4) Banning over-the-counter securities trading to maintain normal exchange within the stock exchange.

(5) Secretly investigating speculative manipulators in various industries, and after investigating and finding them, in addition to specially important cases where other punishment measures are determined, general offenders will also be sent to special criminal courts for handling. Resorting to the police and military to stabilize prices is a sign of an emergency situation, and may be effective for a time, but the crisis cannot be fundamentally resolved. Therefore, how to properly guide and rescue the situation is the urgent responsibility of the central authorities, and also the key to the success or failure of the cabinet.

(Note: The grain market last week was temporarily closed due to orders and the semi-annual interest payment period for banks, resulting in a three-day closure, so the market situation is incomplete. This association's wholesale price index for food last week generally used over-the-counter bids.)

### Currency and Finance

(1) Bank Dark Interest Rates

Wednesday of last week was the last day of June, and Thursday and Friday were public holidays following the semi-annual closing of accounts for banks, so the information on currency and finance in this period only covers up to Wednesday.

Last week was the end of June, and not only did banks in the city face a major closing of accounts, but banks in other cities also had to make this semi-annual settlement. Therefore, while there was an urgent need to collect funds in this city, there were also few speculative funds arriving from other cities. The tight credit in the city last week was mainly due to this reason.

First, regarding dark interest rates, on Monday of last week, they were between 3.3% and 3.45%. On Tuesday, they rose to 3.6%, and on Wednesday, they were as high as 4.5%, which shows the popularity of funds. As for over-the-counter interest rates in the securities market, they were also about 5%.

The total difference between deposits and withdrawals of national banks from Monday to Wednesday was 2314.6 billion. If we deduct the approximately 900 billion in fixed deposits of commercial banks at the Central Bank during the same period, the actual net inflow of national banks was over 1400 billion.

Foreign banks maintained a high amount of net deposits throughout the week. From Monday to Wednesday, in just three days, the net deposits were 2262.6 billion. The destination of these funds is noteworthy.

(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates

Last week, in the foreign exchange market, the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to shrink. 100,000 yuan in legal tender was equivalent to 0.14 Hong Kong dollars. The market price of US dollars in Hong Kong was between 5.44 and 5.45 yuan. The exchange certificate continued to rise. At the end of the previous week, it was only 1.46 million yuan, but by Monday of last week, it had reached 1.85 million yuan, and by Tuesday and Wednesday, it had risen above the 2 million mark.

The domestic exchange rates of banks in the city saw the Guangzhou exchange rate rise because of rumors that the authorities would open up exchange in South China. The exchange premium rose from 250 yuan at the end of the previous week to 400 yuan at the beginning of last week. Although it fell back to 350 yuan on Tuesday, it rose again to 400 yuan on Wednesday, which shows a clear trend of funds transferring to other cities.

The Xiamen exchange premium was 80 yuan on Monday and Tuesday, and also rose to 100 yuan on Wednesday. The Yujiang exchange rate was at par on Monday, 20 yuan on Tuesday, and rose to 30 yuan on Wednesday. The Hankou exchange premium rose from 180 yuan on Monday to 200 yuan on Wednesday. Due to the rumor that Northeast circulating certificates were no longer exchangeable and the opening of Shanghai exchange in North China, the Tianjin exchange premium decreased from 100 yuan on Monday to 20 yuan. However, on Wednesday, the Tianjin exchange premium rose back to 50 yuan, which also indicates the large number of funds coming south.

Commercial banks generally lacked funds, interbank lending was frequent, and there was even a shortage of cash. The clearing results for banks after number 60 also showed a deficit of over 426 billion in three days, which further proves the tight credit situation.

(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

At the beginning of the week, due to rumors of tight credit and the authorities' four new measures to suppress prices, people were worried. Yong Yarn initially opened and fell sharply to 4,950 yuan, and after several rounds of rising, finally closed at 5,240 yuan. Meiya opened trading on new shares for the first day, rising by 185 yuan. Lian was also newly listed and reached the price limit of 17 yuan. The rest were lower than the previous week.

On Tuesday, as the end of June approached and the stock exchange was closed for three days, there were too many floating shares to bear the interest burden, and many people sold at highs. The market showed a trend of being unable to rise. Yong Yarn lingered at a low level throughout the day, falling to close at 5,230 yuan. Among the unpopular stocks, Zhongyi, Lian, Huaxin, and Xinhua all reached the price limit.

Wednesday was the end of June, and according to regulations, the Shanghai Stock Exchange was closed for the first half of the accounting year. July 1st and 2nd were the closing days for various industries, and the banks were closed, so there were no transactions.

The "red opening" at the end of the week had many pieces of positive news, and people were exceptionally excited. All stocks rose to the price limit, resulting in a "sea of red."

The foreign stock market opened at the beginning of the week, and because it was near the end of the month, credit was gradually tightening, and the Hong Kong exchange rate was also flat, foreign stocks unanimously retreated slightly. Jardine Yarn fell to 11 million yuan, and Hutchison Whampoa reached the 30 million mark. Union Insurance was 1.9 million yuan lower than last week, and Ye Guang was flat.

On Tuesday, because reports said that the authorities were banning foreign stock trading, people generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Trading was delayed until 11 a.m. The market uniformly tended to be sluggish. Jardine Yarn fell back to 10.6 million yuan. Union Insurance was quoted at 11.5 million yuan, and Hutchison Whampoa fell below the 30 million mark, with transactions at 29 million.

Wednesday was the end of June, and was a holiday, similar to the Chinese stock market. July 1st and 2nd were the days for the semi-annual final settlement, and there was no trading.

### Dramatic Increase in Tung Oil Production in the United States

[New York Shipping News] Tung oil production has gradually become one of the important industries in the United States. In the past, the tung trees planted in the United States were mostly concentrated in the southeastern states. Now, all the tung trees in these areas have grown strong and provide ample shade, and the total annual production of tung fruit is in the tens of thousands of tons. This is vastly different from the situation thirty or forty years ago when seedlings, barely a foot tall, were first transplanted from China to the United States.

At that time, the relevant American companies eagerly bought land and transplanted these tung tree seedlings from China. They also encouraged investors to provide financial support. However, the experimental results were poor and ultimately failed. The planted tung trees did not grow significantly, while surrounding weeds flourished. As a result, many operators abandoned their original plans, unwilling to cultivate and fertilize, and left them to grow or die on their own.

Nevertheless, a small number of investors with faith in emerging industries, in order to compensate for their financial losses, began to cultivate them using more scientific methods. Thanks to their redoubled efforts, tung forests providing ample shade have now emerged on the dry soils of the southwestern Mississippi River basin.

Recently, tung oil merchants held a meeting of the Tung Oil Association in the Mississippi Gulf port in the United States. Chairman Gai Aide presented a report stating:

This year's tung oil production has increased by 22% compared to last year. Although various aspects still need assistance, the tung oil industry is moving forward.

Tung oil has many uses in industry, including paints, enamels, varnishes, electrical insulation, waterproofing, automobiles, brake bands, and soaps, all of which can use it as a raw material. It can also be used to fill gaps in the lead-coated wings of airplanes due to its strong drying properties, which are unmatched by other drying oils.

The tung planting area in the United States now extends to six states, from Georgia and West Virginia to Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and eastern Texas.

One of the difficulties encountered by the American tung oil industry last year was the large-scale import of Chinese goods without tariff restrictions. The American Oil Merchants Association has repeatedly requested assistance from the US government to impose an import tax of 2.5 US cents per pound on tung oil imported from China, in order to restrict the sales of Chinese tung oil in the United States. The tung oil tax bill has now been rejected by the US government, and the previous customs practice of requiring guarantee money for our tung oil imports has been abolished.

The US tung fruit harvest in 1948 is estimated to be about 90,000 tons.

### Silk Production Has Increased Annually for Three Years

According to the Silk Guidance Association: Since the victory, the China Silk Company and the Silk Association have successively guided the promotion of the silk industry, which has been going on for three years. Through the joint efforts of various provinces, silk production has increased annually. In the 35th year, the amount of raw silk reeled with government loans was 6,345 dan for spring silk, 667 dan for dried cocoon silk, and 325 dan for autumn silk, totaling 7,337 dan. The output of local silk in other places was about 12,000 dan, totaling about 20,000 dan.

In the 36th year, the spring silk reeled with government loans was 9,174 dan, the autumn silk was 49 dan, the raw silk reeled with self-raised funds was about 500 dan, the local silk was about 9,000 dan, and the dried cocoon silk was about 2,000 dan, totaling about 21,000 dan.

This year’s spring loans, together with the silk reeled by cooperatives, are estimated at about 21,000 dan, local silk is about 15,000 dan, and dried cocoon silk is about 4,000 dan, which is estimated to produce about 31,000 dan. The autumn cocoons of this year are not yet included. It is rumored that this year's silk production is 420,000 dan, which is untrue. Even in Japan, the most abundant silk-producing country, the annual output is only about 200,000 dan.

Shanghai Conservatory of Music

The National Shanghai Conservatory of Music will enroll 40 freshmen in the five-year specialist program and 20 freshmen in the five-year normal specialist program this year. Applicants must have graduated from junior high school, and the age must be under 18 to be eligible.

Merchant Marine School

The National Wusong Merchant Marine School will enroll 30 new students in each of the two departments this year, which is less than in previous years. In the past, each enrollment attracted about 2,000 applicants, and only more than 100 were admitted. The school must first check the eyesight of the candidates and whether they have close relatives, color blindness, disabilities, nerve, heart weakness, or infectious diseases before registration. If they fail the physical examination, they will not be allowed to participate in the written examination. Although the school has dormitories on East Changzhi Road, new students will not be able to live there this year, so applicants will probably be limited to those from this city. After enrollment, students who fail one-third of their subjects will be asked to withdraw from the school. Because each graduate of the school is in high demand by various shipping companies, the demand exceeds the supply, so the employment problem is relatively easy to solve.

Taxation Academy

In the past, the Ministry of Finance Taxation Academy was responsible for its own enrollment. However, since the spring of last year, it has been changed to be handled by the Examination Committee for Senior and Junior Taxation Personnel of the Ministry of Finance. The committee recruits four types of taxation personnel: business, direct, goods, and customs. If they pass the examination, the new students of customs will be assigned to the school by the Ministry of Finance for training.

### Public Exhibition Cup Basketball Finals: Xinjian Wins Championship; Defeats John 42-29; Awards Ceremony Held on the Morning of the 7th

The Municipal Stadium organized the Public Exhibition Cup Secondary School Basketball League to promote secondary school basketball and encourage competition. Since it was unveiled in late April, group matches have been held first. There were 11 groups in the men's division and two groups in the women's division. Most groups had five teams, for a total of 68 teams. After two months of competition, all group champions were gradually produced. The finals have been held for the past three weeks. The men's division adopted an elimination system, and the women's division adopted a three-game two-win system. The women's division champion has been won by Minli Girls' Middle School. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m., the men's teams Xinjian and John competed. More than a thousand people watched the game. Some of the audience broke into the basketball court, affecting the game. After persuasion, they withdrew, and the game started at 2:45 p.m. The cheerleading teams of the two schools cheered each other on, and the atmosphere was very tense. As a result, Xinjian defeated John 42-29 to win the championship. The cup competition ended completely. The awards ceremony is scheduled to be held at 9:00 a.m. on the 7th at the Municipal Middle School Joint Graduation Ceremony. Speaker Pan will be invited to present the awards. In addition to the two large silver cups, the prizes also include two large pennants donated by the National Sports Goods Store. The Municipal Stadium will return the deposits of the participating teams starting from the 6th and distribute commemorative badges for the cup competition.

Xinjian Leads All the Way

Hu Huichong of John missed the penalty. Wu Hanwen of Xinjian scored. Ma Jinsheng returned the favor. Xinjian led 4-2 and was smooth sailing all the way. At 9-4, John called a timeout and replaced Bai Xianheng with Ding Tie, but it was ineffective. Hanwen scored. Zhang Naihao made all his free throws, and John trailed further behind at 13-4. The generals quickly cheered up. As expected, Jun Bing and Huichong scored one after another, closing the gap to 15-10. At this time, Xin also would not allow them to be unrestrained. Hanwen made a free throw, and the champion probed in, making it 18-10. John replaced Ding Tie with Bai Xianheng again due to injury. Xinjian also replaced Xu Shuyuan with Ji Qiwu. John took the opportunity to rise quickly. Wan Xinghai and Ma Jinsheng scored one after another. The first half ended with Xinjian leading 18-14 by two goals.

John's Effort to Catch Up Proves Ineffective

Switching sides to fight again, Zhang Naihao of Xinjian retired, and Xu Shuyuan drove into the court. Not long after the start of the game, Ma Jinsheng of John had leg cramps twice and called a timeout. Fortunately, he recovered quickly, and the team made the first contribution, but Xinjian's offensive remained undiminished. Xu Shuyuan and Liang Xiongxiao frequently scored. John replaced his generals many times, but it was ineffective. The battle situation has reached its peak. After 27-18, Wang Junbing of John scored consecutively, and Ma Jinsheng shot long and broke the basket, making it 27-24, closing the gap again. Xu Shuyuan of Xinjian made two free throws, and Ma Jinsheng made a free throw to pull back three points. At this point, John gradually showed fatigue. The generals of Xinjian were still fierce, and the overall situation fell into the hands of Xinjian. When the statutory time was up, Xinjian defeated John 42-29 to win the Public Exhibition Cup Men's Division Championship, and John retreated to the runner-up.

The battle with Bai Lu today lasted for an hour and a half. Both sides hit the ball extremely hard. Bai Lu's ability to control the ball was the decisive factor in her victory, but Hurd had to fight to the end for every point.

Women's Doubles Women's doubles finals, Miss Bai Lu and Mrs. DuPont defeated Miss Hurd and Mrs. Dutter 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. The former was the women's doubles champion in 1946, and the latter was the women's doubles champion in the previous session.

Men's Doubles Men's doubles Brounwich and Segman defeated American Tang Bulang and Moloe 5-7, 7-5, 7-5, 9-7 to win the championship. Tang Bulang's performance was abnormal, with many mistakes. Not only did he not help Moloe, but Moloe was controlled by him. If Tang Bulang's performance was normal, they could have won. In addition to winning the first set 7-5, they also took the lead 5-3 in the third and fourth sets.

Mixed Doubles The mixed doubles competition was fierce. Although Brounwich and Bai Lu defeated Segman and Miss Hurd 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, the situation was dangerous and the victory was not easy.

### Wrestling Demonstration Conference: Wang Wending Overwhelms Zhou Songyou

The first Shanghai Wrestling Demonstration Conference was held at the Yokohama Bridge Jingwu General Association at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. More than 500 spectators filled the Jingwu Fitness Room, and the scene was unprecedented. First, the chairman delivered an opening speech, and then the competition began. The referee was Song Zhenfu. The first pair was Zhang Yongfa vs. Zhang Caiming in the Light C grade. Caiming was short and small and could not withstand Yongfa's bravery. The battle situation was one-sided. Zhang Yongfa's victory was not difficult. Yu Hongbiao, one of the five tigers who represented this city in the National Wrestling Competition in the Light B grade, actually forfeited to Zhang Qiao. It is said that Hongbiao was discouraged after failing to score in the National Games. This time, he signed up but did not appear on the court, probably because he was intensifying his practice and secretly hiding his skills in preparation for the Shanghai Wrestling Championship in mid-October to show off his skills. In another pair, Sheng Dahong vs. Tong Yongfu, Dahong kicked his feet quickly and moved quickly. Yongfu lost to the kicking feet three times in a row, and became a failure gene. In the Light A grade, Quan Guoliang, the third runner-up in the National Games, also forfeited to Zhang Guiping. In another pair, the battle between Wang Wending and Songyou was wonderful. Wending's technique was sophisticated, and his feints were especially brilliant. Ju Songyou was able to support without defeat in the first and second rounds, but in the end, Wang Wending's wit was extraordinary, and Zhou Songyou lost by one fall.

### Tennis A League: Green Light Wins Enpai

In the tennis league A group, yesterday was the third match. Green Light defeated Enpai 13-2 at its own field. Green Light lost two points only in the sixth pair, and the rest won by straight sets. The match between Lianmei and Youlian was postponed due to wet ground. The result of Jinlan vs. Zhonghua will be reported tomorrow. In the second match of the B group, Guangming defeated Lianmei 8-7, and Green Light also defeated Meiting by one point, and the situation was very even. Jinkuan defeated Bixun 9-6, which was also quite tense. The rest were one-sided. The results are recorded below:

Central Wins Zhangyuan 13-2

Guangming Wins Lianmei 8-7

Jinlan Wins Bixun 9-6

Tiyun Wins Railway 12-3

Green Light Wins Meiting 8-7

Shanghai Wins Zhonghua 13-2

In addition, in the first replay, Shanghai defeated Tiyun 9-6. There are still four groups that need to be completed within the day. According to Green Light, it is hoped that the Chinese B team will go to the association at 4:00 p.m. today for the replay.

### Baseball Exhibition Game, Part Three: Red Sox Play US Military League Today; Yesterday's Game Postponed Due to Rain, Replay Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper] Part two of the baseball exhibition game between the Manila Red Sox and the All-Star Team could not be held due to the torrential rain yesterday morning. The organizer has decided to postpone it to tomorrow (6th) and hold it at the same time and place. The lineup of the All-Star Team has been announced by the leader Tang Jing. Yu Changluan, the Chinese pitcher who performed well in the first game, was still not listed as a candidate, which is puzzling. The team will play with a lineup that is just a cosmetic change. The Philippine team can hardly be threatened and will sweep Shanghai.

This afternoon at 3:00, the Red Sox will still meet with the Military League at the racecourse according to the original order. In another scene, the traditional Independence Day commemorative match will be played by the Amateur Baseball Association at the US Military Academy against the US Navy, starting at 3:00 p.m.

### World Games Rowing Pre-Selection: University of California Wins

### Reader's Opinion: Suggesting Improvements to Passenger Vehicle Services by Two Railway Bureaus

Mr. Editor: The long lines of cars refueling a few days ago, though temporarily gone, remind us that gasoline is obtained with foreign exchange and is still very valuable. Those in charge of vehicles should consider how to use them more effectively for the benefit of the country and its people. However, there are many strange things in the world that are beyond our expectations. The passenger pick-up vehicles of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway are one example. These vehicles are often seen going back and forth in the city, but they are sparsely populated with few passengers. Sometimes there are no passengers at all except for the ticket seller. A few days ago, the reader encountered one of these vehicles on Xizang Road. Several people got off with luggage because the trams and buses were too crowded at the time, so they took the vehicle to Jing'an Temple Road. At the same time, several people wanted to get on the vehicle, but the ticket seller refused to let them on. The passenger pick-up vehicle refuses to pick up passengers, but insists on driving around in the busy streets, wasting every drop of sweat and every drop of gasoline. This is truly unfathomable. I imagine it is not to show off wealth and deliberately make fun of the citizens of Shanghai! The reader is not clever enough to figure out the reason, so I kindly request your newspaper to uncover the truth and hope the Beijing-Shanghai Railway will give me a satisfactory answer. Sincerely, I wish you good health. Reader Song Botong, July 3rd.

### Argentina's "Peron Dynasty"

— Lei Ying

An American tourist was eating in a restaurant in the capital of Argentina. He saw that there were as many as twenty-eight kinds of ribs on the menu, so he casually ordered a "small rib." A few minutes later, the "small" rib came, a full two inches thick and fourteen inches long! It was also thickly coated with white lard, weighing at least four ounces.

He was very satisfied with the meal, and even more pleasantly surprised when he paid the bill. The prices here were several times cheaper than in the United States!

The whole world is suffering from famine, but Argentina has plenty of food. Rice, wheat, and meat can be exported in large quantities, making it the envy of people all over the world. Argentina itself is well aware of this, and Argentine President Peron is making full use of this weapon, moving step by step towards becoming a Latin American dictator.

Indeed, Peron is already the dictator of Argentina, but the methods he employs are much more sophisticated than those of Hitler and his ilk.

What enables him to control Argentina's wealth is the "Argentine Trade Bureau," abbreviated as I.A.P.I., which has enormous power.

A farmer is happily watching his abundant fields when a civil servant comes over and pats him on the arm:

"Congratulations, congratulations, this year's harvest is really good."

The farmer happily thanks him for his concern. The civil servant says with a smile:

"The government has decided to buy all your harvest for one dollar and thirty-five cents per bushel. If you don't have time to harvest, can we help you? Sir, this is entirely to help you!"

When the old farmer hears that he can only sell at such a low price, he can't help but get anxious. But what's the use? They are I.A.P.I.!

The general prices of goods in Argentina are indeed very low, but when exported to foreign countries, the prices are shockingly high. All transactions are controlled by the Trade Bureau. One-third of the meat currently needed by the United Kingdom is shipped from Argentina, and Argentina supplies more than one-half of the grains. In addition, Italy, France, Greece, and other Latin American countries have to reluctantly allow themselves to be exploited in order to get help from Argentina. A large portion of the loans given to various countries in the Marshall Plan ended up in Peron's pocket. Not only that, Peron also demands various political concessions from his customers. Recently, Bolivia rejected his demands, and as a result, ships carrying food to Bolivia suddenly mysteriously "ran aground" for several months; as soon as Bolivia conceded, the grain ships immediately "escaped danger." Uruguay also resisted once, and suffered the same fate.

Argentina's newspapers are all under government control. One newspaper refused to give in and criticized the government's policies. As a result, the finance department of the Trade Bureau suddenly sent people to the newspaper to check the accounts, saying that the accounting methods were incorrect and fined them a three-day suspension of publication. Then, the electrical business department of the Trade Bureau came and said that the electrical wires in the newspaper office were not installed correctly and the newspaper had to suspend publication for seven days. Then, the workers' welfare department of the Trade Bureau sent people to investigate, saying that the ventilation equipment in the typesetting room was not correct and the publication had to be suspended for a month... After half a year of this, the newspaper authorities had no choice but to change their attitude.

Peron also kept a close eye on the education sector. Professor Hu Yang was anti-government, so Peron suddenly announced that professors who were fifty-five years old this year had to retire. The fifty-five-year-old Hu Sai had no choice but to obey the order and resign. But the following week, the person who replaced Hu Sai was an old professor who was sixty-two years old and was "Peron's man."

But the people of Argentina do not hate Peron. They say in private: "Peron himself is not bad, but the people around him are really bad—especially 'she.'"

"She" is Mrs. Peron. She is noble and beautiful, with a head of golden blonde hair. She was originally a not-so-famous actress, but was suddenly appreciated by Peron and became Peron's mistress, and then officially married Peron in 1945. In fact, Mrs. Peron does not interfere with Peron's policies. Originally, she herself also had a "small court." The high officials of the Peron government not only had to be loyal to Peron, but also frequently came and went between this "small court," competing to gain favor. She also ran a newspaper that praised her every day.

But she is also somewhat uneasy. She knows that all good things must come to an end. However, she said: "If I fall, no one else can stand up. You just wait and see!"

### The Beautiful Mrs. Peron

### Medicine

— Qian Wen

The so-called Shen Nong's Herbal Classic consists of three volumes, with 365 types of medicine. Liang Tao Hongjing doubled it, Tang added 114 more, Song added again, and by the Ming dynasty, this old version had 1,518 types of medicine. Li Shizhen compiled the Compendium of Materia Medica, adding 374 types, combining with the old ones to make 1,892 types, which is enough. Qing Zhao Xuemin compiled a supplement, adding 884 types. Chinese medicine is not like Han Xin's command of troops. These 2,776 flavors are specially prepared for selection. A prescription may only match four or five flavors. Medicine shops also do not have all of them, so patients often have to seek medicine from many places.

The old version has 2,935 attached prescriptions, increased by 8,161, for a total of 11,096 prescriptions. Attached prescriptions are used for reference, but Zhang Shaotang's preface to the revised version says, "It can be used for checking medicine, but it cannot be said that the contained prescriptions are sufficient to cure diseases." Since not all prescriptions are usable, why add them indiscriminately? Just talking about medicine, how many of these 2,700+ things are truly capable of curing diseases? In the future, I think there will be no more additions. If there are, it will only be waiting for the discovery of special new drugs. If additions continue endlessly, even if Shen Nong were to be reborn, he would not be able to identify them all.

The world says that medicine is about intention. The use of medicine means that rotten and stinky things can be transformed into magic. If you are competing for magic, then nothing cannot be used as medicine. Bedbugs, human lice, broken pens, waste paper, or they may indeed be useful; there are those who capture white clouds in the mountains and put them in a secret room, breathing them in. This is just a game, but this method is also good when the air is too dry. Burning filial sons' shirts to ashes and applying them to the face can treat facial [conditions]. Taking from the fact that it is made of ramie cloth, or it is also reasonable, but the dust from a widow's bedside mixed with oil is effective in treating ear sores. Why must the dust be sought from a widow's bed? Burning the ashes of a rope used for suicide and mixing it with medicinal water to treat sudden madness, its effect is in the medicine. If it is said that rope ash is usable, why must it be a rope used for suicide? Burning the ashes of a rope used to tie pigs in the twelfth lunar month and mixing it with water to treat children's crying from fright, it is difficult to explain the reason. Mixing mud from the soles of shoes with water to treat not being accustomed to the water and soil is very dangerous and must not be tried. As for saying that during a popular epidemic, taking the clothes of the first patient and steaming them on a steamer will prevent the whole family from being infected, this is nothing more than a method of disinfection to prevent infection. Placenta, the umbilical cord has become waste, it is usable, if you say human bones, skulls, mummies, human monsters (teratomas) are usable, then it is a big problem. Even saying that human genitals, human testicles, human blood, human flesh can be used as medicine, I don't know where to get it?

Zhao Xuemin said that Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, in the human section, "is not said to help the world, but to incite evil," so he deleted this section from his book. However, Zhao's book still lists human aphids. Human aphids are maggots from dead people. They are found in coffins in corpse-raising fields, so they are considered usable, and it is also noted that they must be obtained from undertakers in corpse-raising fields to show that it is legal. But he also said, "Then there are unscrupulous people who sneak into the coffin storage place and steal coffins," because if you ask the undertaker and can't get them, there will inevitably be those who are greedy for heavy profit and steal coffins. This thing is said to be able to treat leprosy, which is still based on the idea of "using humans to treat humans." Leprosy cannot be cured, people know it, but human nature loves life. After hearing this saying, patients will definitely seek a trial in the hope of a miracle effect. Guangzhou once had a case of cooking and eating infant corpses. Although the perpetrators did not kill for profit, destroying the corpse is also not allowed by law. The people are poor and suffer from this evil disease, recognizing this as a ray of hope, which is truly pitiful. The downfall of heresy to this point, Zhao did not think about it. The entry of human into the record is also enough to inspire good. The saying that human blood can cure consumption is still very popular among the people, and Lu Xun took it as a theme, which became a moving novel.

### The Tempering of Works

— Lianhu

Writing is not an easy task, although writing can be helped by inspiration, but inspiration is nothing more than a flash of wisdom that the author occasionally has in a certain environment and is fleeting. It is not something that can be obtained at any time and in any place. Even if you have inspiration, except for a very few exceptions, it is still difficult to obtain the highest results. The author must be penetrating and insightful, throw themselves into the depths to sift through the mud and pick up pearls, and put in a lot of hard work before they can obtain "the most exquisite image" and achieve the realm of perfection. The following are stories of several great writers struggling to write:

Flaubert often described the hardships of "Madame Bovary" in his letters:

"I don't know why I'm angry today, maybe it's because of my novel. This book always can't be written, I feel more tired than moving mountains, sometimes I really want to cry. Writing a book requires superhuman willpower, but I am just a person." He also said:

"I'm dizzy and discouraged today. I worked for four hours and couldn't produce a single sentence. I didn't write a line all day today, although I crossed out a hundred lines. This kind of work is really difficult. Art! Art! What kind of demon are you, to chew on our blood and sweat? For what?"

Every time Ouyang Xiu wrote an article, he would paste it on the wall and revise it again and again. When it was finalized, there was often not a single word left from the original text. Zhu Hui'an once saw the original manuscript of his "Drunken Pavilion Record." The beginning was three or four lines, and all were crossed out and replaced with the five words "Around Chu are all mountains."

Wang Jinggong's quatrain "Spring breeze turns the south bank green again" originally had "green" as "to," circled it, and noted "not good," changed it to "pass," circled it again, changed it to "enter," and then changed it to "full." After about ten such changes, it was finally decided as "green." (From Hong Jinglu's "Rong Zhai Continued Notes")

From this, it can be seen that the completion of genius requires human effort. It is especially easy to see in the tempering of works. The works published by writers and artists are all the final revised versions. In these mature works, we often only see the harvest, but not the difficult and arduous cultivation that the harvest has gone through. If we can pay attention to the author's writing stories, it is not difficult to find the importance of "tempering" in the process of completing the work.

### Lines Near Clouds

— Bai Jiao

Writing orchids for Jing'an Clinic, for Abbot Ben Guang

Putting down the pen, I always see a pure heart, searching for Xie Ting for thousands of years. Wanting to return to the mountain to break the black basin, re-muttering straight until today.

The thick ink seems cluttered but the faint ink is real, the brushwork is a new and unique rendering. The mountain range emits fragrance deep within the clouds, who comes to quietly admire this lonely shore?

Also seeing Yang Zhi in a clean vase, looking at the Buddha's disciple with anxious expression. Coming out of the mountain to write a thousand orchids, people return to the Xiao Temple with stars at night.

### A Washbasin

— Yanfan

Like the storm surge last week, I was really worried that after I sent out my manuscript and received the manuscript fee, I wouldn't be able to buy back a piece of manuscript paper and an envelope. It was so terrible, so crazy, really like the collapse of the earth and the tsunami, making people feel cold!

Last Friday, the maid at home wanted to buy a washbasin. She took 400,000 yuan to the department store to take a look. The price of the washbasin was 950,000 yuan each. She asked to pay 400,000 yuan first and wait until she got home to take the remaining 550,000 to pick up the goods, but the store refused. So she hurried back to get 1 million yuan, but the department store was closed when she got there. It was 3:30 pm at that time. The next morning, the price of the washbasin was 1.2 million yuan. The maid's money was not enough again. She came back to get twice as much money and finally bought it back for 1.45 million yuan. In the afternoon, she went to other places to take a look. The same size and quality of washbasin cost 1.6 million or 1.7 million. Finally, when she went back to the place where she bought it, the value of the washbasin had increased to 1.8 million yuan. This is real. The price doubled in a day and a half. This terrible record is unprecedented. One, two, three, four times, people generally feel a kind of low air pressure, like a dense cloud that won't rain, pressing tightly on the chest.

I heard that the price of soap last month increased four times, and the price of cigarettes also increased two or three times. Which daily necessities only increased by one time? When prices had just stopped for a few days, the price of bus and tram tickets doubled (200%), and ships were about to increase again, and public utilities were about to increase again. The storm surge, like the collapse of the earth and the tsunami, seems to be brewing again. Is there no end to these terrible days?

### 

The new mayor of Beiping has been announced but has not yet taken office, so the city council still needs Mayor He to take the brunt of the questions and answers. Then there was Councilor Liu, who spoke first, hoping that he "become a perfect person." This is also a moralistic term, but it is one step further than Mr. Fan of Shanghai's "be a person." The ancients often said, "There is no perfect person after the Three Dynasties," which shows how difficult and precious a "perfect person" is. Even above the Three Dynasties, there may not be a truly perfect person. A "perfect person" is more difficult than a sage or hero. There must be no misconduct and no dissenting opinions. Therefore, even with Confucius's sagehood, the "Nanzi" aspect made his disciples unhappy and became the ammunition for modern "Down with the Confucian Shop" advocates. Even with Guan Gong's cultivation, the Jingzhou affair still led to failure due to his strictness, leaving a stain in history. Even heroes with great achievements are difficult to guarantee against all mistakes. One mistake means that they cannot be a "perfect person." Therefore, Buddhism emphasizes asceticism through countless tribulations, unstained by any dust, to cultivate a perfect golden body! Councilor Liu used this to expect Mayor He, which can be said to be particularly caring, but if the words stop here, it is still a personal relationship, a practice problem, and has little to do with the duties of the council. Therefore, Mr. Liu continued to question "the two iron beds at the Beijing Hotel?" This is related to the mayor's "perfect person" and also conforms to the original intention of the councilor's speech.

Therefore, Mayor He also solemnly explained that his wife had borrowed two beds from Tianjin when she returned to Ping and placed them in the dormitory. They would be moved back soon. He also said, "If I wanted to be corrupt, I would never be greedy for a few chairs, tables, or a few beds." This answer is quite reasonable. Mrs. He is a European woman, and the Beijing Hotel is purely European-style. It is common to borrow and use them because they are accustomed to and similar. No problem arises for the “perfect person.” In addition, there was Councilor Wang's question about the trees in Wansheng Garden, and Councilor Fei's question about the property rights of the Beijing Hotel, which Mr. He answered one by one. Those listening in the audience could not easily criticize, and "perfect people" are not easy to obtain and cannot be asked for perfection.

Mr. He is about to leave office, so although he was present, his words and deeds were full of emotions of departure. Although the councilors questioned him, their wording was relatively tactful. Finally, they jointly resolved to praise the mayor's efforts and dedication during his tenure and telegraphed the central government to assign him a new position to express their thoughts of departure. Then, at this meeting, Mr. He had gained great sympathy and comfort. The ancients said, "Those whose souls are dimmed and dissipated are separated." Once a person arrives on stage and it's time to leave, the masses will often forgive them. Humans are emotional. Isn't that true?
