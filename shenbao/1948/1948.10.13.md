### Legislative Yuan Temporarily Convenes a Closed-Door Meeting: Hearing a Report on the Use of US Aid; Two Proposals to Increase Currency and Stop Robbery Prevention Are Submitted for Review

[Report from our Nanjing Bureau, 12th] The Legislative Yuan held its tenth meeting of the second session on the 12th. However, before the meeting began, reporters who had arrived to observe were abruptly refused entry by the constables guarding the venue. The reporters argued that the agenda and meeting notice did not state that it was a closed-door meeting, and contacted the press room. It was stated that due to considerations by the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee, there were many unresolved issues in the use and allocation of US aid, and if they were made public, it might affect loans. Therefore, it was decided to hold a closed-door meeting. Once the US aid issue's report, questions, and answers were completed, the public meeting would begin. The reporters were helpless and could only gather in the lounge waiting. When the recess arrived at around 11:00 AM, the members who went upstairs to rest met the reporters and asked why they had not gone to the venue to report. When they heard that it was a closed-door meeting, they were all surprised and unaware. According to the members, government personnel attending the meeting included Executive Yuan President and US Aid Application Committee Chairman Weng Wenhao, Committee member and Liaison Specialist Yan Jiagan, Secretary-General Shen Xirui, and Foreign Deputy Minister Liu Shishun. First, Weng reported on the evolution of US aid, followed by Yan listing numbers to report on the detailed situation of the use and allocation of US aid since April of this year. Ninety percent of it was old news that had already been published in the newspapers. People became tired of listening. At the end of the report, the venue was already buzzing with chatter. At this point, the reporters felt that the content of the meeting was not at all necessary to be kept secret, and that changing the agenda and holding a closed-door meeting in a regular meeting was not legally compliant because it had not been initiated by a member or proposed by the president for consultation and consent. They directly visited Secretary-General Zhang Zhaoyuan and questioned the reason and expressed their protest. Zhang initially told them that the reporting content had been agreed upon by President Weng to be published in full. As for the closed-door meeting, it was the opinion of the Executive Yuan and a decision agreed upon with the Legislative Yuan. The reporters still argued that since the report could be fully disclosed, why change to a closed-door meeting and requested Zhang to inquire with President Weng for an answer. After President Weng and President Sun consulted, it was decided to resume the public meeting. Zhang also said when answering the reporters that he himself was most opposed to closed-door meetings. President Sun also surprisingly asked why change to a closed-door meeting during the meeting, and his words were quite apologetic, and he repeatedly apologized to the reporters. The reporters, having achieved their goal, said goodbye to Zhang and entered the venue to work. From 11:30 AM to 12:10 PM, approximately a dozen people raised written or oral questions, mostly focusing on the fairness of the allocation in various regions and the efficiency of seasonal use. After a measurement, President Weng requested that they be answered in writing and the meeting was adjourned. The regular meeting continued at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, with President Sun still presiding. The reporting items listed on the agenda had already been completed in the morning's closed-door meeting, so the discussion items began. The first proposal was the proposal by Shen   Yu and others to supplement the method of stabilizing the value of gold yuan currency "to enhance the credibility of the currency system and benefit implementation" (see this newspaper on August 8 for the main points of the content). More than a dozen members spoke, all expressing their agreement in principle to the proposal, but some held amendment and reservation opinions on certain details. The main points were approximately: (1) Item (b) "Increasing Production" in the proposed method was too brief and should be supplemented and emphasized. (2) To stabilize prices and maintain currency credibility, we should "fight tigers" and "borrow heads". (3) There is no need to expand the Gold Yuan Currency Issuance Supervision Committee. (4) All finances should be made public, and a method of issuing public bonds and compelling wealthy households to subscribe should be determined to make up for the deficit budget, avoid inflation, and reassure people. (5) The Gold Yuan Currency is a management standard and adopts a 100% reserve system, so the issuance reserve fund should not be used. (6) The exchange price of silver subsidiary coins must be far lower than the metal price of the pure silver they contain, so there is no need to stop their issuance. The discussion of this proposal lasted for two hours. Finally, it was passed without objection and submitted to the Financial and Economic Committee and the Economic Resources Committee for joint review. The second proposal was the proposal by Liu Shidu and others to prevent panic buying, encourage production, divert surplus funds, promote national employment, enrich products, stabilize prices, and achieve the actual results of economic reform. After the proposer explained, several members jointly submitted a written opinion, believing that the scope involved in the proposal was too broad and the proposed methods were only empty principles, and advocating that it be reserved. However, after the proposer explained again, the voting result was still to submit it to the Financial and Economic Committee and the Economic Resources Committee for joint review. The meeting adjourned at 6:15 PM in the afternoon. The economic rationalization bill and other proposals that were not discussed were put on the agenda for the next regular meeting.

### U.S. State Department Releases Figures on Military Aid to China: Nearly 90 Million U.S. Dollars Already Transferred to Our Government; Economic Aid Approximately 100 Million U.S. Dollars

[United Press International, Washington, 11th] The State Department announced on the 11th that since April, military aid funds totaling $88,275,170 have been transferred to the Chinese government. This amount represents 75% of the $125,000,000 in military aid to China approved by the 80th Congress. The State Department's estimated figures were revealed in a report to President Truman on aid to China. According to the report, these funds have been used by the Chinese government to purchase guns, ammunition, aircraft, engines, tires, radios, and more.

Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman announced that in the past six months, food and other economic aid worth $97,908,000 has been shipped to China or is en route, representing a portion of the $275,000,000 in economic aid to China. Goods approved or already shipped to China include wheat, rice, and flour worth $20,028,000; petroleum worth $22,000,000; cotton worth $5,700,000; and fertilizer worth $1,180,000.

The State Department stated that the Chinese government had tentatively designated $87,500,000 for its army, $9,000,000 for its navy, and $28,000,000 for its air force.

The department added that the food shipped to China covers half of the food rations for six major cities, with the other half sourced domestically. The report stated that shortly after the start of the military aid program, China experienced difficulties in obtaining military supplies and requested U.S. assistance. The U.S. is using its own military inventory to supply China, which will be replenished later.

Of the $87,500,000 in aid allocated to the Chinese army, $68,000,000 is for purchasing ammunition, $25,000,000 for purchasing engines, vehicle tires, and explosives, and $4,000,000 for purchasing petroleum. The report also stated that approximately $3,603,000 has been designated by the Chinese Navy Department for purchasing parts, ammunition, and renovating ships transferred to China. The Chinese Air Force has designated half of its $28,000,000 budget for purchasing petroleum, parts, surplus U.S. bombs, and ammunition from the U.S. forces in the Pacific.

Hoffman stated that $203,300,000 of the economic aid to China will be used to purchase essential commodities such as food, fertilizer, petroleum, and cotton. An additional $70,000,000 will be used for production equipment and technical services, with the remaining funds allocated for administrative expenses. The U.S. survey team led by Stuart, requested that a portion of the $70 million be used to supplement the needs of seventeen major railroads, power companies, and other factories. Stuart is still in China to determine how to use the remaining funds for construction aid to China. At the same time, the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction is drafting a long-term plan to improve China's rural economy. The committee will have a fund of $27,500,000 jointly donated by the Economic Cooperation Administration and the Chinese government. Although Hoffman did not list the committee's plans, the projects will include flood control, irrigation, public health, and research to improve seeds and seedlings.

Hoffman concluded that the cotton given to Chinese yarn factories by the Economic Cooperation Administration will be exchanged for yarn and textiles, but only if the yarn factories are allowed to obtain legitimate profits and are prohibited from speculative hoarding. Half of this yarn and textiles will be sold on the market to recover currency and curb currency flooding or bartered for domestic crops, while the other half will be sold abroad to earn foreign exchange.

### Chinese Scientists and National Construction – Wishing Success to the Joint Annual Meeting of Ten Scientific Organizations –

Ten scientific organizations, including the Science Society of China, held a three-day joint annual meeting in the capital and Beiping, which successfully concluded the day before yesterday. Branch annual meetings will follow in Guangzhou and Chengdu. This, along with the Academia Sinica convocation of academicians held half a month ago, is a grand academic event for the nation. Amidst the current turbulent world and unstable national affairs, gathering the wisdom of national experts to engage in scientific nation-building research demonstrates the scientists' dedication to learning, patriotism, and calm, genuine spirit, which is truly admirable. While happily reading the news of the meeting, we would like to wish the joint annual meeting success and look forward to greater progress in the future where Chinese science is more closely coordinated with the cause of national construction.

Modern scientific research in China actually began after the founding of the Republic of China. The Science Society of China was founded in 1914. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's grand plan to build China through science, the "Industrial Plan," was first established between 1920 and 1921. The exhortation to "catch up" and the advocacy of scholars joining forces can be said to be aimed at a common and consistent goal. Unfortunately, due to social inertia and the obstruction of foreign invasions, scientific progress was greatly hindered in the past two decades, leading to heavy sacrifices during the War of Resistance. Post-war chaos has continued to impede the long-awaited recovery of science and industry. This realistic lesson is too serious. The mission of Chinese scientists in the future should undoubtedly be to contribute more and more effectively to the cause of national construction.

The inherent nature of natural science is international, so we often hear talk of "science knows no borders." However, from the perspective of the actual research and effectiveness of modern science, science definitely possesses a national character. Science must first contribute to national construction and the welfare of the people, and then advance to contribute to the happiness of all mankind. China is a great country, but it is also a weak country with backward science. Today, we must not only learn from the pain of the past and realize the absolute necessity of national defense science for the self-defense of modern independent countries, but also draw lessons from the close cooperation between science and politics in various countries of the world, and mobilize the limited number of scientists nationwide to strive towards the grand goal of national construction.

On the opening day of this year's annual meeting of scientific organizations, Honorary President Weng Wenhao, in his speech, called on scientists across the country to cooperate with the government to promote social progress. President Chiang Kai-shek, at the Academia Sinica convocation of academicians, solemnly expressed his expectation that scientists across the country "devote their efforts to national construction." He believes that to build a modernized China "is to build a scientific China." This statement has in fact pointed out the true path of close cooperation between politics and science in the future. The government must make the greatest effort to promote scientific research in the future, and what we earnestly expect from scientists across the country to dedicate themselves to national construction is threefold:

First, scientific specialized research must be coordinated with national construction plans. Scientific research should naturally be comprehensive, and applied science research should not be neglected at the expense of pure science research. However, on the other hand, scholars must pay attention to the current needs of the country, consider the country's construction plans, determine their urgency and importance, and engage in specialized research in various fields to prepare for national use. For example, for the economic construction plan prepared to realize the industrial plan, the technical construction closely related to science that needs to be realized in the plan requires scientific experts from various departments, and they must be entrusted with planning and training, cadres or technicians, to work together to avoid empty talk. Important state-owned industries, as well as convenient civilian industries, all require countless scientists and engineers to study and design. As for the construction of national defense projects, even more highly developed research is needed, and we expect a high degree of contribution from scientists in countless departments. The call that President Chiang made during the war that "national construction must achieve absolute national defense security" and the warning that "without science, there is no national defense; without national defense, there is no nation" are even more worthy of deep understanding and vigorous action by our scientists in today's tense international situation.

### Trial Opens at Nanjing District Court for Case of Leaking Currency Reform Secrets; Defendants Xu and Tao Both Shirk Responsibility

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The case of Tao Qiming and Xu Baiqi leaking currency reform secrets was tried on the 12th by Xu Bangzhi, chief judge of the criminal division of the Nanjing District Court, with lamps lit in the dark grand courtroom. Supervisors Zhao Xi and Chen Qinghua, and Secretary Zhu Binglin all attended the hearing. Wang Zhaopeng, president of the District Court, and Chief Prosecutor Chen Xianyu also personally attended as observers. Defense attorneys Deng Zijun, Jiang Hairong, Ji Su, and Wang Jian, representing defendants Xu Baiqi and Tao Qiming, were summoned to court. The trial opened at 9:05 a.m. and defendant Tao Qiming was questioned until 11:10 a.m., when the court adjourned. The trial resumed at 2:00 p.m. and defendant Xu Baiqi was questioned until 3:45 p.m. The focus of the questioning was on how Xu Baiqi provided confidential information to Tao Qiming, and how Tao flew to Shanghai to instruct his wife, Li Guolan, to sell Yongsha stock. The two defendants mutually, in a way, both coincided and did not coincide in shrugging off responsiblity. Xu Baiqi denied intentionally leaking information to Tao Qiming or conspiring to profit. Tao Qiming pushed the responsibility on his wife, claiming that trading stocks was a regular occurrence for her and not something he had instructed her to do. Tao further claimed that he himself was completely unaware of the currency reform news. Tao, when questioned, wore a silk-lined robe and single trousers, deliberately maintaining a calm demeanor and feigning recollection and contemplation. The judge asked in detail about his family situation and his history of entering school and taking on jobs. Tao replied that although he worked in the Ministry of Finance, he had no relationship with Finance Minister Wang Yunwu. The judge asked Tao when Xu Baiqi revealed the news. Tao stated that after he found Xu to ask for leave, Xu immediately said, "You can go." Xu then said that he had been ordered to draft a document suspending operations for banks and money shops nationwide, but only had the month, not the date. "At the time, we were very curious about what this meant, and what the consequences would be. Later, he said that you could go to Shanghai and ask Yuan Yang'an." The judge pressed, "Since Xu Baiqi did not know what it meant and felt curious, why did he ask you to go to Shanghai to ask Yuan Yang'an, an irrelevant person? Isn't that strange? Did Xu Baiqi really have no intention?" Tao said that Xu had no intention, and he denied that Xu had discussed doing stock trading with him. Regarding why he flew to Shanghai at the time, Tao stated that it was to save money. After arriving in Shanghai, he immediately visited Yuan Yang'an and informed Yuan about the suspension of operations for banks and money shops nationwide. Tao claimed that Yuan said that this was highly unlikely, and asked, "What does Xu Baiqi want you and me to do?" Tao responded to Yuan, "He didn't say he wanted us to do anything." After about ten minutes of conversation, he returned. The next morning, Tao had not yet gotten out of bed when his wife went out to trade stocks. Tao claimed that he did not order his wife to trade stocks, nor did he himself trade stocks. Trading stocks was a regular occurrence for his wife, and he did not know Li Boqin and others. The judge then rebuked him with Tao's confession at the Criminal Police Team, to which Tao replied, "I hadn't rested for several days at that time, and was really exhausted. I myself didn't know what I was saying." Finally, Tao requested the court to investigate four points: (1) He first met with Xu Baiqi on August 18 to ask for leave, and only then did they talk about the proposed order to suspend operations for banks and money shops nationwide, and that Xu learned of it before Tao. (2) He never ordered his wife to trade stocks or inform her of the news. (3) He never discussed speculation/trading with Yuan Yang'an. He did not know about the currency reform news at all. The court then asked when Tao learned of the currency reform news. Tao replied that it was at 11 p.m. on the 19th when he was returning to Shanghai. He heard about it at a cigarette shop at the train station. Then, the Court stated that the claim that Xu Baiqi did not inform him about the news and that he then went to consult Yuan Yang’an to confirm that he had no knowledge of the news seemed unlikely. At this point, it was 11:20 a.m., and the judge announced an adjournment.

The questioning of Xu Baiqi resumed at 2:00 p.m. Xu looked quite nervous and shrunk back due to the cold. After asking about his age and background, the judge immediately asked about his family situation and his acquaintance with Wang Yunwu. Xu stated, "I became acquainted with Wang Yunwu at the Academia Sinica, and then worked with him at the Commercial Press for about twenty years. I followed Minister Wang to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance." Xu admitted to introducing Tao Qiming to work at the Ministry of Finance, but they did not have a close relationship. At about 12:30 p.m. on August 18, Vice Minister Xu ordered the drafting of three telegrams, one of which was for the suspension of operations for banks and money shops nationwide for three days. At that time, he did not know about the currency reform news. After drafting the document, he encountered Tao Qiming downstairs, who was planning to go to Shanghai, so he told him that he had been ordered to draft a telegram for the suspension of operations for banks and money shops nationwide for three days. He did not know why, so he told Tao to ask Yuan Yang'an after arriving in Shanghai because Yuan was quite knowledgeable and had no other intention. He only later realized that he was wrong. The judge immediately questioned, "Why would you claim that you didn't know the confidential order of the Ministry of Finance and ask Tao to ask Yuan Yang'an, an irrelevant person? That's strange, really strange." Xu claimed, "I was too busy at the time and didn't have time to talk with Tao in detail, so I asked him to go. But I don't know when Tao went to Shanghai, whether by train or plane." Xu added, "The confession at the Criminal Police Team failed to record my meaning, and I was in a state of nervous disorder after being interrogated under fatigue. Those who have not experienced it firsthand cannot know that kind of pain. I am indeed a good person, and I ask the court to consider my situation. If I wanted to profit, why would I ask Tao Qiming to go? I have many acquaintances in Shanghai. Why would I definitely tell him? I hope the court will listen to me. My words are sincere." The judge asked Xu if he knew that Tao was trading stocks. Xu said, "I casually mentioned to Tao in a conversation that I read the anonymous news in the newspapers that someone sold it, saying you went to Shanghai as well, Tao said I did not do stock trading, but my wife had sold two million shares. At that moment, my impression of him was not good. Until he was arrested, the Criminal Police Team asked me to admit that I had discussed doing stock trading with Tao Qiming, and that I told Yuan Yang'an the news in Shanghai. That record is incorrect." At this point, both defendants completely shirked responsibility for the leaking of information. At 3:45 p.m., the investigative court declared the session closed and announced that a date would be set for a further hearing. After the adjournment, Xu Baiqi's daughter handed Xu a velvet coat and said to Xu, "Take care of your health," and left in tears.

### Ministry of Finance Clarifies Questions on Regulations Regarding Adjustment of Capital for Commercial Banks

[Our Nanjing, 12th dispatch] After the promulgation of the regulations on the adjustment of capital for commercial banks, banks and firms repeatedly inquired the Ministry of Finance about the interpretation of the articles. In order to clarify some questions in the articles, the Ministry of Finance has recently drafted an "Interpretation of the Regulations on the Adjustment of Capital for Commercial Banks," which was promulgated on the 12th. (The original articles were published in the first edition of this newspaper on September 5th, please refer to them.) The full text is as follows: Interpretations of Articles 1 and 2 of the Regulations on the Adjustment of Capital for Commercial Banks are omitted.

Interpretation of Article 3: (1) The minimum capital amount for banks and firms in various regions should be applied uniformly within the same county (regardless of whether their address is located in the county seat or in a township). (2) For trust companies with attached banking departments, the capital amount should be handled in accordance with banking departments with attached trust departments. (3) If more than one branch is established in the same city or county, the additional branches do not need to increase capital in accordance with the one-tenth regulation. (4) If the operating funds of the trust or savings department attached to a bank's branch are allocated by the headquarters trust or savings department, no additional capital is required.

Interpretation of Article 4: (1) If the expenses incurred in increasing the original value or utility of assets due to processing, improvement, or renovation have already been included in asset items such as operating equipment or operating real estate, the prices may be revalued and included in the asset appreciation items for calculation. If they have been included in profit and loss items, they may not be included. (2) If there is a surplus after the asset appreciation, the portion exceeding half of the capital to be increased may be used to supplement the public reserve fund, but it may not be distributed.

Interpretation of Article 5: (1) The "total amount of capital to be increased" referred to in this article refers to the new capital amount proposed by the shareholders' meeting. This new capital amount may exceed but must not be less than the minimum prescribed standard. If the resolution of the shareholders' meeting only increases to the minimum standard, then this "total amount of capital to be increased" refers to the minimum capital amount to be increased. If the resolution of the shareholders' meeting increases capital beyond the prescribed standard, it refers to the amount that the shareholders resolved to increase to. For example: The shareholders resolved to increase the capital to two million gold yuan. 1. If the original asset appreciates to one million gold yuan, then shareholders should still contribute one million gold yuan in cash. 2. If the original asset appreciates to 300,000 gold yuan, then shareholders should still contribute 1.7 million gold yuan in cash. 3. If the original asset appreciates to 1.2 million gold yuan, then shareholders should still contribute one million gold yuan in cash. The surplus of 200,000 gold yuan may be transferred to the public reserve fund, but it may not be distributed. (2) Shareholders may not use property to offset cash payments for increased shares. (3) The newly increased cash capital will be returned three months after each bank or firm deposits it with the Central Bank. The deposit of funds in places where there is no Central Bank will be handled separately by the Ministry in consultation with the Central Bank. (4) If the asset appreciation is still less than half of the capital amount to be increased, the portion of the cash increase to make up half should also be deposited in the Central Bank. (5) If the assets of a bank or firm are adjusted to exceed the standard capital amount, the surplus can be combined with the capital to be increased for setting up branches. In the future, if branches are added within this scope after approval in accordance with regulations, no additional capital is required. (Continued on page 4)

### Three Powers Accuse Soviet Union of Threatening Peace, Will Urge Security Council to Take Action, Mediation Efforts by Neutral Nations Ultimately Fail

[Our dispatch] Paris, 16th broadcast: U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, along with the Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration Hoffman, and Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith, arrived in Paris this morning aboard the presidential plane from New York.

[Our dispatch] Paris, 12th broadcast: The United States, Britain, and France have abandoned all attempts to seek compromise with the Soviet Union on lifting the Berlin blockade and have begun to urge the Security Council to take action on the Berlin issue. This coincides with U.S. Secretary of State Marshall's return to Paris after talking with President Truman in Washington. The Western powers have been disappointed with the mediation efforts of neutral nations and are now drafting a resolution to lift the Berlin blockade with decisive action. Marshall has just arrived in Paris and has not yet appeared at the United Nations General Assembly, and seems to remain the behind-the-scenes strategist of American policy. The President of the Security Council, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, has also given up all hope of seeking compromise and has begun to look for a solution to the Berlin crisis. After a week-long recess, the Security Council is expected to hold a formal meeting on the 13th, at which time the Western powers will accuse the Soviet Union on three points: (1) In the Security Council, accusing the blockade of Berlin as threatening world peace. Although it is clear that the Soviet Union will use its veto power, it will still insist on accusing the Soviet Union in the Security Council. (2) In the General Assembly, Britain has taken the lead in accusing the Soviet Union of making the world uneasy and the Soviet Union's proposal to reduce armaments by one-third within three years is insincere. (3) In the General Assembly, the West is trying to pass the American atomic energy control plan by an overwhelming majority, thereby accusing the Soviet Union of being the only obstacle to the establishment of a control agency.

[Our dispatch] Paris, 12th broadcast: U.S. Representative Austin delivered a speech in the Political Committee of the General Assembly on the 12th, accusing the Soviet Union of obstructing lasting peace, threatening world peace, refusing to cooperate with the United Nations, and undermining the solution to the Berlin crisis. Austin's speech was delivered hours after Marshall returned to Paris from the United States. Well-informed sources said that Austin's fierce attack on the Soviet Union indicated that the Western powers had begun to abandon all attempts at compromise and instead demanded that the Soviet Union be condemned as a threat to world peace. Austin said that Soviet leaders have a major misunderstanding, and they insist that different economic and political systems can coexist, and he called on the United Nations to find ways to eliminate the Soviet Union's misunderstanding. Austin reviewed the United States' military buildup plans, acknowledging that the United States had "reduced its armaments too much and too quickly" after the war. Austin vehemently denounced Vyshinsky's accusation that the United States was "manufacturing war" as a propaganda tactic, and specifically attacked the Soviet Union's proposal for the five major powers of China, the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to reduce their military spending by one-third in 1949, calling it malicious. Austin asserted that there could be no talk of disarmament until peace treaties were concluded with Japan and Germany, as these armaments were necessary conditions for safeguarding world peace. Austin then mentioned that the Soviet Union, in the dispute over atomic energy and disarmament, refused to open its territory for the United Nations to investigate whether it was fulfilling its treaties. He said that the Soviet Union had not yet provided assurances that the country was willing to participate in world organizations.

### Soviet Representative Vyshinsky States Willingness to Disclose Military Strength Details, But Requires West to Provide Same Information, Denounces Warmongers in Red-Faced Speech

[United Press, Paris, 12th] Soviet Representative Vyshinsky stated that he is willing to publish the details of his military strength, but the West should also provide the same report at the same time, including weapons such as atomic bombs and germ warfare. The Soviet Union refused to report its three-armed forces to the world before the United States released the truth about its atomic bomb storage "on the table."

[United Press, Paris, 12th] During the afternoon meeting of the Political Committee of the General Assembly on the 12th, Soviet chief representative Vyshinsky delivered a passionate and powerful speech, criticizing that when Western representatives attacked the Soviet Union, "it was like a horse off the reins, breaking all limits." He criticized the "poisonous" remarks of British, American, and French representatives, slandering the Soviet Union and resorting to any means. The West is trying to "sabotage behind the scenes" the Soviet Union's proposal for the five major powers to reduce their troops by one-third within a year. He claimed that there was sufficient evidence to prove that "there are a large number of people in the world who instigate war." Vyshinsky angrily said that Western countries tried to induce Hitler to attack the Soviet Union in 1939. "If you ask me to put my cards on the table," he claimed that he could prove it. Vyshinsky reviewed the disarmament speeches of Western representatives one by one and reprimanded British representative Shawcross for "completely losing his mental balance and his moral concepts are also gone." He scolded the West for trying to obstruct all progress with atomic bombs and refusing to disarm. Vyshinsky spoke for more than an hour, and his wording was unprecedentedly fierce, no less than that of U.S. representative Austin's speech. Vyshinsky still delivered his speech in the style of a prosecutor, his face flushed, jumping non-stop in his chair, waving his hands wildly from side to side, pointing his finger directly at representatives of other countries, and shouting loudly by hitting the table. He often turned around and pointed directly at British representative McNeil behind him. The audience laughed from time to time because of his intense attitude, especially when Vyshinsky mentioned that the Soviet Union did not require Luxembourg to disarm. He spoke for one hour and twenty minutes, and continued to scold endlessly.

[United Press, Washington, 11th] U.S. defense officials recently estimated that once a war breaks out, U.S. industry can be converted to munitions production within 18 months. They said that the new plan to convert to military industry has improved the methods of World War II a lot, greatly shortening the period of production change. The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff estimate that the preparation time for future national "overall" operations will be extremely short. In order to cope with threats, the department has requested the National Security Resources Board and the Munitions Board to plan a plan to accelerate national production. The Munitions Bureau has already planned to accumulate strategic materials worth 2 billion yuan and store a large number of production tools in underground warehouses. In addition, it is also planned: (1) Standardization of materials purchased by the Army, Navy, and Air Force; (2) Research and control of transportation, manpower, electricity, and other services; (3) Decentralization of industry so that the national industrial potential will not be damaged when bombed.

### French Government Drafts Plan to Prevent Communist Rebellion, 100,000 Elite Troops Wait for Orders on the Outskirts of Paris

[United Press, Paris, 12th] A confidential report on the 11th stated: The French government has drafted a detailed plan to automatically control Paris as a whole within an hour in the event of an armed rebellion to prevent the rebels from seizing the capital. A special police team of 100,000 people has been specially trained to deal with the Communist Party. The person in charge is Minister of the Interior Moch, who deeply hates both the Communist Party and the de Gaulle faction. The report said that if the French government is threatened, regardless of whether it comes from the far left or the far right, the plan will be implemented. It is reported that the plan has been changed since the Communist Party presided over the big strike in November last year. It is confident in the current labor unrest initiated by 315,000 miners and has countermeasures to deal with it. According to the traditional location of rebellions in France, Paris is the center, so the purpose of the plan is that in addition to the rebels occupying the strategic military points of the capital, the government forces will take the initiative to occupy them. During the crisis before the rebellion, the troops temporarily registered in the suburbs of Paris, and this method was used in November last year. The troops are highly motorized and can drive into the capital from Versailles, Saint-Germain, and other garrison towns in half an hour in the event of an emergency. The police in the city are on standby. According to the above-mentioned report, the military and police can control the following strategic military points: the Police Headquarters, the President's residence, the Ministry of the Interior, the City Hall, the General Radio Station, the Ministry of the Army, the railway station, and the electrical union. The government believes that once the above-mentioned nerve center is in hand, it can quickly quell the rebellion. If the rebels are lightly armed, they can be captured in one fell swoop. The elite troops ordered to suppress the rebellion are said to be the battle-hardened Second Armored Division and the rifle teams of North Africa and Senegal. In the past two years, several underground military arsenals have been uncovered and a large number of heavy weapons have been obtained, and it is believed that the rebels can only fight with rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades at most. As for heavy weapons and aircraft, they are all under the control of the government. If the rebels unexpectedly launch a riot, the government forces only need to be able to control the initial situation to break all armed revolutions of the puppet regime.

### With Yoshida Shigeru Organizing a New Cabinet, Japanese Political Parties Have Different Opinions, The Liberal Party is Still Not Sure of Nominating the Prime Minister Today

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] The Japanese House of Representatives convened a House Steering Committee at 5:00 pm on the 12th to discuss matters concerning the nomination and election of the Prime Minister. During the session, the Democratic Party first stated: "If the Liberal Party organizes a national unity cabinet, then we will cooperate. Our party's decision in this direction has already been notified to the party, and after receiving a reply, the highest-level cadres' meeting will decide on the attitude. Therefore, we hope that the nomination election will be postponed until tomorrow." Then the representative of the Liberal Party said: "The Democratic Party's proposal has some points that need to be reviewed, so our party also hopes to postpone the nomination election for one day." As a result, the nomination election will be changed to the afternoon of the 13th.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] The changes in the Japanese political situation have now entered a chaotic stage. In addition to the Liberal Party actively preparing for the upcoming Prime Minister nomination election, most other political parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The Liberal Party still has difficulties in the future Prime Minister nomination and cabinet formation work. As of now, the attitudes of various political parties are as follows:

(1) The Democratic Party is now exchanging the issue of a national unity cabinet with the nomination of Yoshida. Otherwise, the party will cast blank votes in the Prime Minister nomination election. The party is roughly divided into three factions: one faction advocates immediate resignation, one faction advocates resigning after Yoshida is elected, and the other faction advocates cooperating with Yoshida if Yoshida agrees to form a national unity cabinet; otherwise, resigning.

(2) Because the Socialist Party once advocated a united conservative front excluding the Socialist Party, there is still no possibility of compromise between the Socialist Party and the Liberal Party. Therefore, the party has decided to nominate Katayama as a candidate for the next Prime Minister.

(3) The National Cooperative Party now separates the Prime Minister's nomination from joining the new cabinet as two distinct matters. It is rumored that this is the result of MacArthur's hint. The party will still consider the policies proposed by the Liberal Party before deciding whether to join the new cabinet. In addition, the Social Reform Party, the Farmers' Party, and the First Members' Club have decided to support Yoshida, while the Communist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party have decided to nominate Kuroda Hisao as a candidate for the next Prime Minister.

### Lai Yi Expresses Opinion: War Will Not Occur

[US News Agency, Paris, 11th] UN Secretary-General Lai Yi stated today that war will not occur in the "foreseeable future." He made this statement in response to an inquiry from a newly published newspaper in the United States, which had also sought opinions from other world figures on this issue. Mr. Lai's optimism is based on the belief that "today, no responsible politician needs war, and those in responsible positions will do their utmost to avoid it." He continued, "In principle, major powers may often have conflicts that lead to a third world war, but if the nations of the world possess even a little common sense and exercise the most basic instinct of self-preservation, war will definitely not occur."

### Commodity Supply Can Return to Normal: Industrial and Commercial Representatives Plead Difficulties; Jiang Jingguo Instructs Strict Adherence to Price Limits; Supply of Production Raw Materials Can Be Considered Worry-Free

[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to further understand the actual situation of industry and commerce in Taipei City, Jiang Jingguo held an enlarged discussion meeting yesterday, separately talking with representatives of retail stores, manufacturers, and the City Chamber of Commerce. The first discussion meeting was held at 4 p.m., and those invited to attend were responsible persons and representatives of major stores and companies in Taipei City, including Guo Linshuang (Wing On Company), Sun Yu (Wing Loong Company), Zhang Fuzhong (Five Continents Pharmacy), Yang Xuanqing (Lao Jiu He), Fu Liangjun (New Light Underwear), Gu Jun (Yi Chang Woolen Fabrics and Department Store), Zhang Yiping (Heng Yuan Xiang), Zhang Changhong (Warrior Rubber Company), Zhang Deqian (Mao Chang Glasses Company), Cen Zong (Xu Chongdao Pharmacy), Zhou Huaikong (De Tu Gu Company), Mo Gaoming (Ting Dali), and more than a dozen others. The representatives expressed their difficulties with one voice, stating that the amount of goods allocated by manufacturers was scarce, and after the rush buying spree, the stock of materials was reduced, making it difficult to meet market needs. Rationed shopping is theoretically feasible, but technically very difficult. After listening to the representatives' opinions, Mr. Jiang stated that the fundamental solution is to increase production. The supply of raw materials can now be considered worry-free, and it is expected that the supply of goods in stores can return to normal in one and a half months. He also instructed the representatives to strictly adhere to the price limits, assist the government in implementing policies, and stabilize prices. At 6 p.m., Mr. Jiang invited representatives of manufacturers to talk. Representatives from various industries, including Du Yuesheng, Chen Qicai, Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, Hong Nianzu, He Liren, Cheng Nianpeng, and more than a dozen others, attended. The central topic of discussion was still the issue of raw materials. The difficulties stated by the representatives were largely the same as those reported in the past. There was also an exchange of views on the industrial raw material supply measures passed by the Materials Adjustment Committee. The discussion lasted for more than an hour. At 7:30 p.m., Chamber of Commerce representatives Xu Jiyi, Du Yuesheng, Ge Jechen, Jin Runxiang, and Yan Esheng visited Border Affairs Supervisor Jiang to offer several opinions on the general commercial situation in the city. The representatives pointed out that there are currently several abnormal phenomena, such as the difficulty in buying vegetables, the lack of coal and paper, and the reappearance of the black market for gold notes, and requested that the authorities pay attention to them so that they can be remedied as soon as possible. Mr. Jiang stated that the shortage of materials has already been noted, and efforts are being made to alleviate it. The rush buying spree was caused by the temporary psychological panic of the citizens and is now subsiding. Management work is being gradually strengthened, and in time, it will be effective. Finally, he hoped that the representatives would assist the government and strive to maintain the "August 19" price limits. The discussion meeting ended at around 8 p.m.

### Resolutions of the Materials Adjustment Committee: Total Monthly Allocation of Yarn for Replication Industry Limited to 30,000 Pieces; Adjustment Committee Decides to Establish Three Subgroups: Industrial Raw Materials, etc.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai District Materials Adjustment Committee held its seventh meeting at the Central Bank conference room yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m., chaired by Liu Gongyun. The supply of industrial raw materials and the adjustment of daily necessities were discussed in detail, and the following important resolutions were made: (1) The industrial raw material supply measures submitted by the Industrial Raw Materials Subgroup Review Committee were revised and approved. (2) The total amount of yarn allocated to the replication industry in this district shall be limited to 24,000 to 30,000 pieces per month. Before a unified yarn purchase and allocation method is determined, the Textile Construction Company and private yarn factories will continue to allocate yarn. (3) To facilitate the work, the Adjustment Committee decided to establish three subgroups: industrial raw materials, daily necessities, and fuel, to be responsible for handling review, allocation, and adjustment matters. (4) The Shanghai District Grain Exchange and Storage Method drafted by the Grain Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee was approved in principle and allowed to be implemented on a trial basis.

### Supply of Industrial Raw Materials

1.  Industrial raw materials should be divided into the following categories according to the source of supply: (A) all supplied domestically, (B) all supplied from abroad, and (C) part supplied domestically, but the insufficient part still needs to be supplied from abroad, in order to facilitate the planning of supply and allocation. 2. For raw materials supplied domestically, (A) those with special management agencies shall be managed by the special management agencies; (B) those without special management agencies shall be supplied by the trade associations; and (C) those without special management agencies and trade associations shall be purchased by the Central Trust Bureau through consultation.
2.  Raw materials supplied from abroad. The principle should be to minimize the increase in government foreign exchange expenditure, and the Import and Export Management Committee should complete the allocation procedures for the fifth and sixth seasons as soon as possible to facilitate import.
3.  Regarding the allocation issue, except for cotton, fuel, and imported raw materials, which all have special management agencies, the remaining raw materials that do not have allocation agencies are proposed to be collected by the Industrial Association, which will formulate allocation methods and submit them to the Materials Adjustment Committee for approval by the Economic Control Supervisor.
4.  Although each allocation agency has its own affiliation, for the sake of unified adjustment, it is necessary to report the production, sales, and inventory numbers of each material to the Materials Adjustment Committee on a regular basis so as to understand the overall situation. The forms for this regular filling and reporting are proposed to be negotiated by the secretary of this committee and the relevant agencies.
5.  The amount of raw materials currently held by each manufacturer should be clarified, and the registration should be handled by the Social Affairs Bureau.

### Knitting Small Factories Request Allocation of Raw Materials

The small knitting factories in this city are subject to the government's rationing system, and all yarn is allocated by the government. However, these small factories are limited by the articles of association of the trade association and are not entitled to allocation rights. Therefore, more than 300 small manufacturers have jointly submitted a document to the Supervisory Office, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the China Textile Corporation, requesting that small factories be allowed to apply for registration and allocation of raw materials.

### Personnel of the Fuel Management Committee Accused of Corruption: Sun Jice et al. to Be Publicly Tried Today; More Than Forty Witnesses Summoned

[Report from Our Newspaper] Sun Jice, former director of the Distribution Department of the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee (later transferred to director of the Coal Adjustment and Supply Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce), and Lin Keying, chief of the Business Section of the department, are jointly accused of extorting bribes from merchants and engaging in corrupt practices by taking advantage of their positions. The municipal government has previously transferred the defendants and all case files to the District Court for detention. Judge Xie Zhiying is scheduled to conduct the initial trial in the Eighth Criminal Division of the court at 9 a.m. today, and more than 40 relevant witnesses have been summoned to appear in court. It is reported that Sun et al. are accused of deliberately suppressing applications from merchants to purchase coal and unreasonably reducing their allocations while serving in the department.

They would solicit bribes from merchants before agreeing to increase their allocations, or resell the surplus coal on the black market and share the profits. It is also known that the allocated coal was mostly handed over to Han Chengpu, the owner of Jianhua Coal Company at No. 20, Lane 850, Beijing Road, in this city, for resale on the black market. Han Chengpu was previously questioned in the corruption case of Yang Yunfu, director of the Transportation Department of the Fuel Management Committee. After the Municipal Police Bureau summoned Sun Jice, Lin Keying, and the persons in charge of Huaguang Coal Company, Shenhu United Business Office, Songjiang Electric Company, and various shipping companies, it was discovered that the Distribution Department and the Transportation Department had engaged in

very detailed corrupt practices. The Fuel Management Committee has regulations on the allocation of coal to various shipping companies and factories in the city that need coal. Applicants for coal allocation must fill out a coal consumption form, which must be certified by the trade association and submitted to the committee for investigation and verification. The allocation work is handled by the Distribution Department of the committee. After Xu Letian, the former chairman of the committee, left his post and Zhang Xiwei was appointed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to take over (Zhang took office in June of the sixth year), Sun Jice also followed Zhang to serve as the director of the Distribution Department of the committee. Sun and Lin Keying, chief of the section, saw that the allocated coal price of the committee was very different from the market price, and the allocated price was much lower than the black market price. Therefore, they solicited bribes from shipping companies and factories applying for coal allocation. Merchants who colluded with the department had their coal allocation increased, even exceeding their actual consumption by more than one time. Even business firms that had already ceased operations could still be allocated a large amount of coal every month without the certification of the trade association and the investigation of the committee. The recipients of the allocation directly sold the warehouse warrants issued by the committee on the black market,

and the profits obtained (i.e., the difference between the allocated price and the black market price) were divided, with 40% going to the Distribution Department and 60% to the allocating merchants. Some of them jointly sent representatives to contact the Distribution Department, and some individually contacted the Distribution Department. After the District Court opens the trial today, the full details of the case will be known.

### One Underground Bank Investigated and Ordered to Close: Xincheng Commercial Firm Also Fined 5,000 Gold Yuan

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Gold Control Bureau announced yesterday that it had cracked down on an underground bank. It is reported that Xincheng Commercial Firm, located at No. 19, Dexin Lane, Lane 324, Nanjing East Road, originally engaged in the grain business. After the bureau conducted two investigations on the 17th of last month and the 1st of this month, it was found that the commercial firm had more than 120 customers and frequently received and paid cash. The account books and telegrams also stated the collection and payment of remittance fees and interest, as well as the collection of commissions for out-of-town customers' foreign exchange transactions. After investigation, most of the funds in the loan items were not necessary for the business, and a "cart force" item was established to replace the commission, conceal income, and evade taxes. In addition to the tax evasion part, which has been referred to the Direct Tax Bureau for investigation, the commercial firm's operation of an underground bank is proven to be true. The bureau has reported it to the Supervisor's Office for approval and ordered the commercial firm to cease operations in accordance with Article 15 of the Banking Law and imposed a fine of 5,000 yuan.

### Control Prices in Production Areas: Formulate Concrete Plans; Strive to Restore Standards Before August 19

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the rush buying spree in this city gradually subsided, it was learned from relevant sources that some merchants are still breaking through the August 19 price limit and using various illegal acts to deal with the government's control policies with the black market and underground warehouses. The current management authorities have seen through their tricks and decided to use the most severe means to punish illegal merchants. After inspecting the economic situation in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, Jiang Jingguo has formulated a concrete plan to effectively and quickly control prices in various production areas so as to restore them to the standards before August 19. At the same time, he will implement material adjustment measures within the area to improve the supply of materials in various places. He has also prepared for the stabilization of the lives of public educators and workers in the city, the long-term stabilization of prices, and the solution of the difficulties in factory raw materials and the increase in production, and all of them will be implemented. In addition, the Fourth Task Force of the Suppression and Construction Brigade has been transferred to Shanghai to strengthen economic inspection forces. According to a spokesman for the economic management authorities yesterday, the biggest problem at present is not the shortage of goods, but the panic. If merchants do not make good choices for themselves, the example of Wang Chunzhe and others is not far away.

### Fish Market Dispute: Meeting to Be Held Today to Discuss

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, disputes have arisen between the brokers and fish vendors in the fish market in this city over the allocation system. The two sides have published advertisements in the newspapers attacking each other. The Yufan Tongren Lianyihui (Fish Vendor Association) requested that each vegetable market in the city be assigned three representatives by the association to allocate fish to the three representatives on a daily basis when the fish arrive, and then re-allocate them to the fish vendors. The brokers insisted that each fish vendor must individually go to the market to purchase the fish. The fish vendors then exposed the black market insiders, such as brokers exploiting illegal profits in the middle, colluding with scalpers to manipulate fish prices and monopolize the market. In order to resolve this dispute, the general manager of the fish market will convene a joint meeting of the Yufan Tongren Lianyihui, the Fish Wheel Industry Association, the Seafood Sales Association, and the Broker Association this afternoon to discuss the matter.

### Shanbaohui's Top House Case: Wasted More Than 10 Billion Public Funds; Investigation by the Supervisory Committee and Administrative Office Completed; Involving Multiple Senior Officials

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Supervisory Committee and Administrative Office of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Districts received a secret report in mid-month accusing the Custody Committee of the Post-War Rehabilitation Enterprise of collective corruption. The Supervisory Office immediately sent personnel to investigate. Over the past three weeks, the investigation has come to a close, and it is heard that considerable gains have been made, and all kinds of evidence have been collected. The personnel in charge of the investigation are now drafting a report and submitting it to the Control Yuan. According to the reporter's investigation from various relevant parties, the content of this case is very broad. The main points are that a large number of senior officials of the committee have privately used public funds to buy houses as private residences. The purchase fees are all valued in gold bars, ranging from twenty to thirty bars for those with higher positions and more than ten bars for those with lower positions, depending on the position and size of the residence. At the same time, after buying the house, they are allowed to reimburse the repair costs, which is also a big deal. It is also learned that the total public funds spent on buying houses is about 200 gold bars, or more than 150 billion legal currency. The source of this fund is the sale of 160,000 bales of cotton yarn held in custody by the committee (one saying it is only a part, because the committee controls a huge amount of materials, including 160,000 bales of cotton yarn and 5 million US dollars, which can be freely disposed of). The personnel involved in this case include Xiang Jingyun, director of the Secretariat of the Committee, Li Ming, the person in charge of the Finance Committee, and employees Chen Hongduo, Gao Qingshou, and others.

Wu Baoliang, Chen Qingquan, Zhang Fuda, Wang Jinsheng, Huang Huailian, Xie Shengbao, Yin Weijun, Xu Quanfu, and Ding Huiquan are acquitted."

Facts of the Crime

According to the facts of the crime stated in the judgment against Yang Guangming and others: "Yang Guangming, a coppersmith at Shenxin No. 9 Factory, joined the Communist Party in Chongqing in the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945] through the introduction of Guo Chuhuai. In June of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1946], he started working at the Shenxin Factory and was under the command of Communist Party member Wang Yiming. On January 30th of the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948], at 12:30 PM, under the guise of requesting coal briquettes and advance salary, he shut down the power supply and implemented a factory-wide strike. On the same day, he organized pickets and propaganda teams, assigned duties, and dispatched people to guard the four factory gates, prohibiting all workers, staff, and the factory manager from entering or leaving. The general representative then presented nine demands to the factory. The factory deemed the demands excessive and no agreement was reached. The defendant gathered all the workers to report on the negotiation situation, and at the same time, the defendant Wu Shizhen was assigned to supervise workers moving stones and iron bars to the third floor. When the military police broke the locks and entered to persuade them to stop, the workers threw the stones and iron bars down, causing great disorder and injuries and deaths to police and workers. After the strike, the defendant Yang Changmin served as the chief of the picket team and general commander, posting notices prohibiting anyone from leaving, issuing armbands for the pickets to wear, and monitoring the actions of important personnel. All notices and armbands were stamped with Yang's personal seal to be effective. The defendants Miao Xinggen and others served as squad leaders, using megaphones to prevent workers from entering or leaving. Fan Jinnan managed the opening and closing of the iron gates. Wu Shizhen shouted unity slogans and supervised the moving of stones and iron bars to the third floor. Leng Tonggen and others, under the instructions of the fugitive Jie Huaiqiong, dressed up and performed plays, satirizing capitalists and inciting struggle. The remaining 21 defendants, including Ma Lianzhong, either participated in the riot or assisted in the situation, which they all confessed to. Wu Baoliang and the other nine were acquitted due to insufficient evidence."

### Inspection of Man Kam To Customs Post After Signing of Sino-Hong Kong Customs Agreement

— Special correspondent of this newspaper

[Dispatch by air from Hong Kong on the 9th from our newspaper] The day after signing the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Agreement, the reporter made a special trip to the Man Kam To Customs Post on the Sino-British border to inspect it. I took a train from Kowloon to Sheung Shui station, and then transferred to a public bus, which took about ten minutes to reach Man Kam To. It takes about half an hour to walk through the Man Kam To Customs Post to reach Shenzhen Market. Although the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway has a Shenzhen station, it is quite far from the market town, so most of the "single carriers" traveling between Shenzhen and Kowloon pass through Man Kam To. When the East River Communists captured Shatoujiao in Paya Bay a month ago, Man Kam To was the only customs post that stood alone on the Sino-British border, which shows its importance.

Inspection of Travelers and Vehicles

After getting off the bus at Man Kam To station, turn a small corner to reach the Man Kam To Bridge. There is a British police station on the bridge, with police officers guarding it with guns. Travelers and vehicles must be inspected here before passing through. After crossing the bridge and walking about a hundred steps, you arrive at Man Kam To. The customs post is on the Chinese side of the bridge embankment, with two Chinese military police guarding it, behaving calmly, unlike the British police's "air of importance." According to Man Kam To customs officials, villagers in the nearby area carry small amounts of grain to the British side, making multiple trips back and forth every day. However, once his or her true identity is recognized, he or she is no longer allowed to leave the customs post. Large-scale smuggling only takes place at night, passing through the mountain paths, and never through the main road of the customs post. The reporter stayed at the customs post for half an hour and witnessed dozens of villagers being inspected, as well as seven trucks. Customs officers were lenient in dealing with villagers who transported small amounts of grain to make a living. Therefore, the bus station in British Man Kam To was piled high with bags of rice and other grains. It is said that the rice and grain can be sold for double the price in Hong Kong.

The Hong Kong Import and Export Department also set up an anti-smuggling station half a mile outside of Sheung Shui. The target of Hong Kong's anti-smuggling efforts is mainly tobacco and alcohol.

Jeeps of the Chinese Customs are frequently speeding on the road from Sheung Shui to Man Kam To. This "freedom" is said to be a gift of the Sino-Hong Kong Customs Agreement.

### Unsmooth Supply of Goods in Various Places; Appeal to Dredge Materials

The county government has telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Shanghai Economic Supervision Office to request solutions to improve the supply of goods.

[Report from Fengxian on the 11th from our newspaper] The county chamber of commerce reported that the retail goods sold by merchants in this county are purchased from Shanghai. However, since Shanghai restricted the movement of goods, the source of all goods has suddenly become a problem, and the balance between supply and demand has been lost. The county chamber of commerce held a meeting of directors and supervisors on the 10th and decided to request the county government to seek ways to dredge the supply of goods.

### Chinese Scientists and National Construction Continued from page two

The second is to improve scientific knowledge through science center education: In scientifically backward countries, scientists, while engaged in specialized research, must also take on the dual responsibilities of popularizing science and cultivating future generations. These two aspects must be equally emphasized in China today. Today, most of China's scientists, except for a few who are engaged in research in research institutions, also bear the responsibility of teaching in secondary schools and above. The discussions at this joint annual meeting placed great emphasis on the popularization and improvement of science education, and paid attention to the science equipment and teaching materials in primary and secondary schools, which is reasonable and gratifying. Due to the destruction of eight years of war, the scientific equipment or factories of universities and vocational schools that meet standards are already rare. Even fewer secondary schools have a set of physics and chemistry instruments, let alone primary schools. In the expenses of schools at all levels, 80 to 90 percent are used for salaries, and equipment fees are extremely limited. In the future, the government should earnestly correct this mistake, and science teachers in schools must base themselves on this goal and provide multi-faceted supervision and assistance. Social education is not an isolated undertaking, but can make up for the inadequacy of equipment in primary and secondary schools. For example, a more complete collection of biological specimens in a museum, and a rich collection of science books in a large library are both sharp weapons of science education. As for the student movements that hinder research and stability and manifest themselves in coercion or strikes, the realistic lessons of the past year in destroying education and science are serious enough! Even if professors and scholars cannot see through their internal conspiracies, they should earnestly prevent and stop them for the sake of the future of science and their own responsibilities, not to mention

Third, transform academic and social customs with scientific and rational thinking: The cause of national construction has countless aspects. Scientists dedicate themselves to national construction through specialized research, and cultivate future generations and improve general scientific knowledge through science education, but his most universal and most fundamental contribution to national construction can be said to be another big one: that is, the transformation of anti-scientific thinking and the construction of a scientific psychology, thereby leading the academic atmosphere and social customs. Mr. Lu Yu Dao wrote a paper for the joint annual meeting, saying that the greatest characteristic of science is "continuous progress" in thought, rejecting old traditions and emphasizing "seeking the truth," and organization and cooperation in realization, rejecting chaos and emphasizing planning. We are very sympathetic. However, what Mr. Lu denounces seems to be more of the conservative old forces, while what we do not understand and are heartbroken about today is the vast number of intellectuals, especially the wandering youth, because unfortunately, their psychological and behavioral manifestations are often anti-scientific. The value of science lies in seeking the truth and advocating reason,——anti-dogmatism, anti-doctrine, anti-blind following. However, in terms of the atmosphere of universities in recent years, some are young people who practice doctrine, some are young people who are indecisive and echo blindly, and there are also many students whose minds are disturbed, whose wills are threatened, and who cannot say anything. Scientific thought trains individuals to distinguish right from wrong, but many universities have coercive student groups that force people to follow blindly, and even resort to violence. Science is achieved through the accumulation of bits and pieces, requiring patience and perseverance, but they only praise the atmosphere of superficial sampling and simulation, despise research and mechanics, and even use strikes to coerce as a means at any time. This kind of atmosphere and propaganda affects people's hearts, making the education field and the general society filled with a kind of empty, shallow, gullible, and blind-following custom. And the most unfortunate thing is that the professors with specialized attainments "can be deceived by their methods" are very indifferent to this situation, and do not come out to speak and correct it with the basic principles of science (seeking progress, anti-chaos). Scholars were initially deceived into thinking that they should be detached and self-sustaining, and finally succumbed to the anti-scientific atmosphere under the coercion of students, not to mention that their research work and teaching were severely frustrated. Here, we are not discussing the current situation from a political standpoint, but only analyzing the pros and cons from the standpoint of education or science. We deeply feel that the recent questioning of suspected students by the authorities must be prudent and legal. However, judging from the actions of destroying academic research caused by indulgence in some universities in the past one or two years, its impact on the atmosphere of primary and secondary schools and society is so bad that it is enough to "arrive at the same destination by different routes" as the stubborn feudal old forces to hinder the growth and progress of the tender seedlings of science!

In short, once this anti-scientific psychology and atmosphere are not eliminated, it will make the efforts of specialized research and science education futile, not to mention establishing a "national construction atmosphere." Therefore, today's scientists can ignore politics, but they cannot ignore the destruction of science by anti-scientific forces. We love the truth and love the country. The fundamental plan is to boldly expose the conspiracies against science and against the country, and strive to build a scientific psychology that loves the truth and loves people. By shifting social customs in this way, specialized research can dedicate itself to construction, and science education can cultivate future generations, so that they can have the progress of catching up. This should be the sacred mission of Chinese scientists to national construction today.

### Fifth Meeting of the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office Decides on the Start Date for Purchases Personnel Organization of Branches and Stations Determined

[Our Newspaper] The fifth meeting of the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Committee was held at the National Bank at 4:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Liu Gongyun presided over the meeting. As a result of the discussion, the following key issues were resolved: (1) The personnel organization of the branches, sub-branches, and stations affiliated with the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office has been determined. Each branch will have one manager, two deputy managers, one business director, and two secretaries. The position of manager will be held by personnel from private factories, while the deputy managers and those below will be filled by personnel from the Textile Construction Company. (2) The joint purchasing funds were originally scheduled to be paid two-thirds by the 10th of this month. Now, private factories have stated that their capital turnover is insufficient, so they are allowed to pay one-half first, and the date for paying the remaining one-half will be determined when cotton purchases are needed. (3) The joint purchasing funds currently received include 50 million yuan from the National Bank, 8.8 million yuan from the Textile Construction Company, and 9.4 million yuan from private factories. Foreign factories remitting funds to Shanghai are specifically exempted from collection fees by the National Bank. After consolidating all funds, they will be distributed to various locations in Shanghai for use. Partial remittances have already started yesterday, and purchases will begin on the 16th. (4) The total amount of national cotton to be jointly purchased is set at 3 million dan, and the allocated amounts are roughly as follows: Hankou 900,000 dan, Xi'an 600,000 dan, Shanghai suburbs 400,000 dan, Nantong 350,000 dan, Shashi 250,000 dan, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other places 200,000 dan, Tianjin 100,000 dan, Nanjing and Zhengzhou 80,000 dan each, Anqing 40,000 dan. (5) The request from private yarn factories with less than 3,000 spindles to be allowed to make free purchases was not approved. However, if small factories have insufficient funds and are unable to pay the joint purchasing funds, it was decided to allow them to exchange yarn for cotton purchased with the National Bank's funds to maintain the continued production of small factories.

### Textile Construction Distribution

Textile Construction distributed goods yesterday as usual, but the types were fewer than before. Distribution was mostly limited to dyeing factories, retail stores, underwear businesses, parasol businesses, and awning businesses. Wholesale merchants were not allocated this period. The allocated goods and prices are listed below: 3B Dragon Head Fine Cloth, 36-inch width, narrow, limited to retail stores at 18.6 yuan. Secondary Brand 29.5-yard Serge Grey Fabric, limited to dyeing factories at 23.3 yuan. B 30-yard 200-count Yarn Serge Grey Fabric, limited to dyeing factories at 19 yuan. Special 39.5-narrow 12-pound Fine Cloth, limited to dyeing factories at 24.5 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge, limited to retail stores at 28.3 yuan.

Jumping Carp Original Color Electric Light Twill, limited to parasol businesses at 16 yuan. Lion Furnace 30-pound 50-yard Canvas, limited to awning businesses at 54 yuan.

In addition, American colored cloth 02-K13 colored coarse cloth was distributed at 0.74 yuan per meter, and 016 colored cloth at 0.8 yuan per meter.

### Brisk Sales of Cotton Cloth

Since the secret dealings of cotton cloth brokers in Qingyun Pavilion were investigated and prosecuted, retail cloth stores have continued to see very brisk sales. Therefore, with supply scarce and demand high, many are replenishing their stock from cotton cloth wholesalers, leading to prosperous business for major piece goods wholesalers such as Yongxin Company. Retail merchants are lining up with membership cards and store seals to purchase goods continuously, and the market trend is exceptionally firm.

### Yarn Merchants Discuss Disposal of Stock Yarn

After trading in the cotton yarn market was suspended, yarn businesses repeatedly requested the authorities to approve the business scope as soon as possible, but no approval has been obtained to date. The industry association held another board of directors meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss (1) urging the Supervisory Office to approve the distribution quota and operating standards for transportation and sales merchants as soon as possible; and (2) the disposal of the cotton yarn in stock after the inventory of yarn stores.

### Silk and Satin Both Selling Well

Since the distribution of rayon, trading has become increasingly quiet. Silk weavers are very disinterested, reproduction businesses are still eager to purchase, and silk stores have also seen sluggish retail sales in recent days, with sales becoming stagnant. The association's distribution quota was not even sold out yesterday.

In the raw silk market, foreign firms have seen quiet trading due to the difficulty in purchasing goods for export. Under the price limit, few transactions have been completed. There have been slight transactions in small lots on the local street, with extremely scattered numbers.

Previously, the retail sales of silk and satin on the local street were booming, and goods such as quilt covers were sold out. Recently, foreign firms, lacking raw silk to offer, have switched to handling silk and satin sales, leading to more demand than supply in the market, and the market atmosphere is strong. Due to purchase restrictions in recent days, sales of domestic goods in retail stores have softened slightly. The association is about to start distribution, and factory supplies have decreased.

### American Cotton Retained in Shanghai No Longer Transported to Other Ports

According to cotton spinning industry sources, many of the inland yarn factories applying for the allocation of American cotton are unable to transport it to their factory locations on time due to transportation issues. Furthermore, after inland manufacturers receive the American cotton, they must hand over the spun cotton yarn to the Shanghai American Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Joint Operating Office. The round-trip transportation is inconvenient and costly. Relevant parties are considering using cotton purchased by the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office in inland areas to offset the American cotton and allocate it to inland manufacturers to save on freight costs. The American cotton retained in Shanghai will be allocated to manufacturers in the Shanghai area as much as possible, spun into cotton yarn locally, and handed over to the American Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Joint Operating Office for unified sales.

### Coal Supply Drastically Reduced

As winter approaches, coal sales are increasing, but arrivals are becoming scarcer, resulting in very weak inventories among industry members who are unwilling to sell, making purchases extremely difficult. In the past, the local market relied on Kailuan for its coal supply (reaching a maximum of 150,000 tons, just enough for local needs). However, since the Beijing-Ningbo Railway was damaged by bandits, the supply has been drastically reduced. Last month, it was only half the previous amount, and this month it has deteriorated further, with only over 2,000 tons arriving to date. Other ports are also experiencing traffic disruptions due to busy military transport, affecting coal transport, and the coal shortage is becoming increasingly severe. Furthermore, the Smoky Coal Adjustment Supply Office has suddenly been ordered to be abolished, and its affairs will be handled by the National Night Merchants Association, which is currently under preparation. The government will establish a Smoky Sample Adjustment Committee to supervise and review the allocation prices, hoping that the association will be established quickly to avoid interruptions in the future.

### Import and Export Management Committee Submits a Request to the Executive Yuan for a Decision on Measures for Overseas Chinese Capital Imports

Since the announcement of the measures for overseas Chinese assets and overseas Chinese capital to import production equipment, they have not been formally implemented due to the implementation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures Order and slight conflicts between some of the detailed rules. The Import and Export Management Committee has drafted revised measures, including the measures for handling imported goods purchased with self-provided foreign exchange that has already been paid, and the measures for using foreign currency deposit receipts, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review. To date, no instructions have been received. The Import and Export Management Committee, the Supervisory Office, and the Central Bank believe that the daily implementation of these measures would help increase production and stabilize prices, so it has been decided that the Import and Export Management Committee will submit a request to the Executive Yuan for an early decision. It is also heard that Central Bank Vice President Liu Gongyun has sent a special telegram to Deputy Minister of Finance Xu Boyuan, requesting that he intercede on the matter.

### Tea for Export Will Likely Be Less

Yesterday, trading in the foreign firm tea market was still sluggish. Because exporters are eager for tea in Europe and Africa, buying interest is still strong, but because production and inventory are both depleted, holders are hesitant, and the trend continues to be one of too many monks and not enough porridge, making it difficult to expand business extensively, and the situation is precarious.

According to industry insiders, a certain trading company in the local market is also planning to add a tea export department soon, and it is expected to be formally established soon. However, given the current scarcity of goods, the company is gradually showing signs of activity in hoarding green tea and other teas in order to plan ahead. If this continues, the future will be even more chaotic. As for domestic tea, there are still more arrivals than sales, and the process is quiet but firm.

### Industrial Association Investigates Raw Materials Needed by Various Industries

According to the person in charge of the Technical Committee of the Industrial Association, the association is instructing the authorities to investigate the past production quantities and raw material needs of 81 industries in the city to solve the current difficulties. Recently, they have been separately convening industry representatives to conduct intensive research, and it is expected that all materials will be submitted to the Supervisory Office for reference this month.

### Raw Materials for Electroplating Industry Members Purchase Goods with Certificates

Due to the limited supply of raw materials for the electroplating industry in the city recently, there has been a frenzy of purchasing. To limit purchases, the industry association has entrusted Rissho Changhao and other companies to stipulate that each member can purchase goods with a certificate each time, limited to one dozen of yellow grease, one dozen of white grease, one bag of sand powder, one pound of Kevan, one pound of Van, one pound of rawhide glue, and one piece of leather board every five days (about six to seven pounds). Purchasers are quite enthusiastic.

### Secondary Grade Xian Rice Slightly Active Food Rice Likely to Be Slightly Finer Flour and Edible Oil Both Suspended Yesterday

Rice trading was quiet yesterday, and the market in the south of the city was practically closed. White japonica rice was said to be out of stock. Secondary grade Xian rice saw a small amount of trading within limits. Rice stores in the market in the north of the city transported and sold their own rice, selling 607 shi. Rice mills purchased, transported, and sold 250 shi. Arrivals in both markets increased slightly, totaling 1,399 shi. Flour was not opened.

Yesterday, there was very little trading in coarse grains. Soybeans are about to be re-registered, and it is said that full-scale rationing will be implemented, following the example of edible oil, but this has not yet been confirmed. Yesterday, the market saw scarce arrivals and depleted inventories, with no transactions. There was no trading in red sorghum, corn, mung beans, or peanuts. Only sesame saw some trading on Zhizhi Road. Nanjing white sesame opened at 30 yuan, and Poyang black sesame opened at 28 yuan, with a total of 70 to 80 packages traded. Edible oil was suspended yesterday.

### Large Quantities of Rice Will Soon Arrive in Shanghai

Another report states that rice arrivals have been scarce, the balance between supply and demand has been lost, and the market is showing signs of having prices but no actual sales. The Economic Supervisory Office summoned the persons in charge of the rice market and the rice industry association, ordering them to be responsible for supplying 250,000 dan of rice to the local market each month. The rice industry association decided that rice merchants would purchase rice from producing areas to meet market needs. It is now learned that since the start, the total amount purchased by rice merchants from various places as of October 8 has reached over 10,000 dan, all of which have been issued purchase permits by the Bureau of Social Affairs, and they will be arriving in the city one after another soon.

### Sluggish Sugar Market

Trading in the sugar market was sluggish yesterday, with few chips in the market. Each stall had buyers but no sellers. The local street was extremely interested, but industry members offered very little supply. The trend was firm, but because prices had reached their limits, it was impossible to raise them further. However, there was a lot of speculation, resulting in sluggish trading and scattered transactions.

### Last Week's Retail Price Index Clothing and Other Categories Rise

According to the Oriental Economic Research Institute, the retail price index of essential daily necessities in the city for the past week (October 4 to 9) is as follows:

(1) The food category was 2.11 times, with no increase or decrease compared to the previous week;

(2) The clothing category was 2.49 times, an increase of 2.89% compared to the previous week;

(3) The fuel category was 2.28 times, an increase of 0.89% compared to the previous week;

(4) The miscellaneous category was 3.76 times, an increase of 1.35% compared to the previous week;

(5) The overall index was 2.59 times, an increase of 1.17% compared to the previous week.

Last week's prices rose due to the stimulation of panic buying. The clothing category saw the largest increase, followed by the miscellaneous category. However, general prices were still below the price limits.

### Business Briefs

Jianghai Customs announced yesterday that, in accordance with government orders, effective immediately, merchants requesting the reissuance of consularly certified freight cars should pay 60 gold yuan per certificate, and those holding duplicates should pay 20 gold yuan.

Tai Kee Company, whose main business is the operation of raw silk transportation and sales in the Myanmar area, has switched to operating raw silk processed textiles due to the sluggishness of raw silk exports. The company is currently negotiating with China Company to order several hundred pieces of silk textiles for its first trial sale.

Cigarette trading still has not returned to normal. Various goods remain firm. Sales in various regions are increasingly strong, and industry members are very eager to purchase. Although factories continue to ship goods, retail sales are overwhelmed. Sales on the local street are smooth, and asking prices remain high.

The government still needs to consider adjusting kerosene prices, and the final decision will be made after evaluation by the Commodity Price Review Committee of the Bureau of Social Affairs. A reporter inquired at a kerosene retail store, which stated that the current selling price is 15.33 yuan per liter for bulk and 16.5 yuan per can. As of yesterday afternoon, they had not received a notice from the association to suspend sales.

Since the shortage of wood and building materials has become increasingly serious, carpenters and construction workers feel that they cannot work smoothly. Some contract workers have had to temporarily suspend their work, while workers are facing the prospect of having no rice to cook. With no way to petition, they are feeling anxious.

The industry association has published notices acknowledging the shortage and black market for bricks, tiles, and cement. It is now learned that lime, which was originally unloaded at the docks near the Old Garbage Bridge on the Suzhou River, has recently been diverted by lime vendors to unloading at Caojiadu and Beixinjing, where the selling price is more than double the limit price, causing panic among industry members. It was heard that no lime boats arrived at Caojiadu and other places yesterday morning.

Due to the oil price adjustments of companies such as American Hand, the asking prices for building materials such as cow hair felt and asphalt have also risen. It is heard that American goods, cow hair felt, is difficult to buy even at 50 yuan, and asphalt cannot be bought even at double the price (i.e., one yuan).

### Starting Next Year, Students Must Use National Identity Cards for Rice Rationing

Private College and Above Presidents Hold a Forum Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] A forum for presidents of private colleges and universities in Shanghai was held at the Tsinghua Alumni Association at 4:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Liu Haisu, president of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts. First, Wang Yukai reported that President Fu Qizhang had contacted the Civil Food Allocation Association regarding students receiving rice rations with certificates. The Civil Food Allocation Association has agreed to postpone the requirement that students must use their national identity cards to receive rice rations until January 1, 1949. Currently, they are still allowed to use the rosters created by the schools to receive rice rations. Subsequently, Ling Xianyong reported that the Sports Committees of public and private colleges and universities have decided to establish six groups for football, basketball, table tennis, track and field, softball, and volleyball, and will first hold competitions this year and plan subsidy methods. For the sake of providing subsidies, all 268 private primary schools with salaries below 40 yuan per month are now planning to hold college and university football, basketball, and table tennis championships at the Fifth District One Center on Friday, the 22nd of this month, at 2:00 PM. The remaining events will be held in the first half of next year. The matters resolved: (1) Recommend Zhu Jingnong and Wang Yukai as representatives to urge the Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee on the 15th to decide the allocation quotas for each school and issue the scholarships as soon as possible. (2) Some faculty and students have applied for their national identity cards more than half a year ago and have not yet received them. Now, purchasing daily necessities such as cotton cloth requires a certificate, which is very inconvenient. It was decided that the association will send an official letter to the Civil Affairs Bureau, requesting that it notify its subordinate district offices to issue the national identity cards of the faculty and students of each school as soon as possible. (3) Currently, the Material Supply Bureau and the China Textile Company have special distribution to public school teachers and other personnel. Purchasers line up to buy goods from morning to night, creating great crowding. If the professors of each school must line up to buy goods, they must sacrifice class time, which greatly affects the students' studies. It was decided that the association would submit a request to the Executive Yuan and send a letter to the Material Supply Bureau, requesting that they consider the time difficulties of the professors and allow each school to create a roster, list the goods they need to purchase, prepare funds, and send a staff member from the school to the bureau to purchase the goods at one time to save time.

### World Baseball Championship The Indian Team Wins the Championship Six Games, Four Wins, Two Losses, Bearden's Reputation Soars

[United Press, Boston, 11th] The Cleveland Indians defeated the Boston Braves 4-3 in the sixth game of the World Baseball Championship on the 11th, winning this year's World Championship. The Cleveland team and the Boston team have played a total of six games, with the Cleveland team winning four games and the Boston team winning two games. According to the World Baseball Championship system, the best of seven games is adopted, and the Cleveland team has won four games. The scoring for the sixth game is as follows:

Indians 001002010 4 0

Inning 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Total Runs Hits Errors

Braves 000100020 3 9 0

Indians: Pitchers Lemon and Bearden, catcher Hegan.

Braves: Pitchers Fosse and Sain, catcher Salkeld and Marche.

[Another dispatch] The Cleveland Indians defeated the Boston Braves 4-3 again on the 11th, completing the great achievement of four wins and two losses in six games, and winning the 1948 World Baseball Championship. This may bring the most prosperous game in baseball history to a climax. After six major battles, Cleveland's left-handed pitcher, Bearden, leaped to become a baseball hero. On Monday of last week, the Indians and the Boston Red Sox had equal points. Bearden pitched countless wonderful balls in the rematch for the American League championship, defeating the Red Sox and winning the qualification for his team to compete in the World Championship finals. In the third game between the Indians and the Braves, Bearden's left hand once again made the Braves unable to fight back and handed in a blank sheet. In today's game, the Indians' pitcher Lemon was showing signs of decline in the eighth inning. The Indian manager Munder made a desperate bet and transferred Bearden into the game to replace Elmon. Sure enough, the morale of the Braves was taken away, and they could not reverse the defeat.

Although the Braves were defeated, they had the momentum to reverse the situation in the eighth inning. The Braves initially used veteran pitcher Fosse, but the Indians demanded everything, so they transferred left-handed spin shooter Spahn, who won yesterday, to the field. The tired soldiers fought again, and it was really powerful. However, too many points were lost, and they could not recover the situation, and let the Indians fulfill their 28-year-old wish and carry the championship away.

Social Services Reader Consultation Legal Explanation

### Reconciliation Agreement Stipulates No Prosecution

[Shen Zhang asks:] Some time ago, I had a conflict with a colleague at work due to a misunderstanding. I accidentally injured his face in three places. After mediation by colleagues, I paid for all medical expenses and other losses, and we signed a reconciliation agreement as evidence. Recently, after he recovered and was discharged from the hospital, he suddenly went back on the agreement, claiming that he would sue me. I am not familiar with the law and do not know how to deal with this. I would be grateful if your lawyer could provide some guidance.

[Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin answers:] In cases of mutual assault resulting in injury, if a reconciliation agreement has been signed and the person has affixed their fingerprint, it indicates that they have waived the right to initiate criminal proceedings. If they renege on the agreement and pursue legal action, the prosecutor may invoke Article 232 of the Criminal Procedure Law to issue a decision not to prosecute.

### What is the Most Expensive?

— Bai Shui

Since the price controls of August 19, what do you say has risen the most?

Almost everything still has some limit; even if it rises a bit, it won't be too much. But there is one thing that is truly "like a prince doing a somersault—out of control!" That is used books.

The used book business has had a few years of bad luck. Since the victory, with a discount of 200%, the price suffered a big setback. Afterwards, because new publications and new works accompanied "new people" and sprung up like mushrooms after rain, old things began to mold. The old antiques on the bookshelves often couldn't recover for two or three years, and no one even asked about them. Moreover, new books were being added at an ever-increasing rate, multiplying by tens or hundreds of thousands of times, making extravagant claims and brooking no argument. Used books had no customers, so how could they do that? Watching the stores selling new books making a lot of money and then also engaging in speculative stocks, some even making a fortune from it, the used bookstore owners still sat on their cold benches every day. How could they not be moved? Therefore, most used bookstores quickly cleared out their inventory and switched to selling new books. Seeing the old tomes and fragrant herbs on the shelves being replaced by newspapers and notebooks, from Feng Yuqi to Mao Dun and Ba Jin, they sold everything, and their cold faces turned into smiling ones. As for how they cleared out their inventory, it was truly miserable. Most were sold by the catty as waste paper. After some sorting, they were resurrected! For a while, even the "Summary of the Complete Books of the Four Treasuries" engraved in Guangdong was weighed by the catty, because selling by weight could earn twice as much as selling by volume! Some stores that were more concerned with culture refused to let the sacred scriptures be destroyed forever and revised their prices. The standard for the revision was also calculated by weight, but in the end, it was not as good as simply weighing them, as they still couldn't be sold. Last winter, because there were too many books being treated this way in Beiping, someone finally spoke up, advocating that the government should invest 10 billion to buy them up to rescue the used book industry. After much clamoring, the Ministry of Education allocated 1 billion, entrusting Peking University with full responsibility for the purchase. Insiders said that this small amount of money could only rescue a drop in the bucket, and the number of used books that were destroyed from then on was simply countless.

No one would have thought that in addition to the five calamities of Niu Hong, there would be this calamity—the resurrection calamity! And this calamity was even more terrible than water, fire, swords, and soldiers. Water, fire, swords, soldiers, insects, and rats are partial and localized, but this was comprehensive and complete. If it continued to develop, all used books might face the fate of destruction. Fortunately, a savior came—the "Gold Yuan Immortal"! From then on, the sea turned into fields again, and used books were resurrected. But this time, the resurrection was too violent. Before, people rejected them from a thousand miles away, but now they reject people from a thousand miles away.

Before August 19, the most expensive used book was no more than 500,000 yuan per volume, and most were around 100,000 yuan, which was equivalent to between 3 cents and 2 jiao in gold yuan. Now, the cheapest book costs at least 5 jiao, and popular ones with good editions cost more than 1 yuan! Before August 19, I went to a used bookstore to buy "Annotations to the History of the Han Dynasty." Eighty books cost only 5 million to 6 million yuan; now, they cost at least 15 yuan! Some ask for as much as 20 yuan. Think about it, hasn't the price increased tenfold? It is said that this is still being polite, and some have increased the price by 20 times at once. Buy it or not! There is no copyright page in old books, so there is no way to talk about fixed prices. If you report them for raising prices, what evidence do you have? So customers can only laugh or cry and are helpless.

According to insiders, this price surge is not entirely due to gouging. Everyone values goods over currency, which is also a reflection of the situation, because recently their colleagues' "auction" prices have also been unreasonably high. (When the book industry buys a batch of used books or a store is willing to sell its inventory, they publicly choose a location for colleagues to bid and trade, which is called auctioning. In the past, they would write the price on a sealed envelope, but now they shout prices like at an auction.) For example, "Yue Mantang's Diary" without supplements has been auctioned for as much as 200 yuan! "Weng Wengong's Diary" also costs about 150 yuan. According to the original price of the books, this is several times higher. (Both books are reproduced by the Commercial Press, with prices between 50 and 40 yuan.) Isn't this too ridiculous? In fact, colleagues are bidding against each other, and they don't necessarily pay immediately. If a customer is willing to pay a reasonable cash price, even if it is slightly lower than the auction price, they can still buy the goods. Isn't this a morbid situation? If it's like this among colleagues, you can imagine what it's like for outsiders.

There are very few used bookstores left in the country now. Outside of the major cities of Beiping, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Nanjing, they have almost disappeared. We who deal with old things often have a fear of extinction. The publishing industry in Masha and Jianyang during the Song Dynasty was also very prosperous, but now there is not even a shadow left! The Ming and Qing editions of today are the "rare books" of hundreds of years later, just like how we view the "Song and Yuan" editions today. But booksellers prioritize profit, not culture. The former's weighing and pricing by the catty and the latter's profiteering and exploitation are all acts of destruction! We hope that the authorities will have reasonable measures and management. Otherwise, the future of culture will be somewhat frightening, because the resources of culture will be monopolized!

### Price Increase

— Suo Bei

I don't know if my thinking is too superficial: Chinese people are extremely talented in economics. Although literacy education still needs to be actively promoted, since the birth of the legal tender, there have been very few people who cannot recognize banknotes. Despite the complex patterns and many types of banknotes, vendors, maids, and young ladies can all understand them at a glance. As for converting customs gold to legal tender or legal tender to gold yuan, they are extremely skilled at calculating.

Furthermore, although there are countless people in our society who have not attended school, from wealthy families to small vendors and rickshaw pullers, everyone can recite the law of cost and the law of supply and demand. The conclusion is that price increases are natural and justified, and even though prices have increased, they are still losing money. If we take it a step further, it would be "we will have to close down and worry about unemployment." When big bosses talk about this great principle, they sit upright and look worried. When small vendors complain about how difficult business is, they are serious and concerned. Their expressions and arguments rarely fail to deeply move people.

Not long after the victory, the market was flooded with American goods, and merchants all lamented the sad future of national industry and commerce. Later, imports of American goods were restricted, and domestic goods rose, and factories, stores, wholesalers, and retailers all greatly increased their prices. Let's put the price increase aside for now; they then proceeded to vigorously promote their "selling it means it can't be replenished" law. At first, I was very sympathetic to this statement, but after careful consideration, I felt it was completely wrong. The price at which it was sold this time is the sum of the cost and profit of the last time it was replenished. The next time it is replenished, the selling price will be the same. Moreover, many goods were replenished long ago and sold late, so the profit is known. How can they say that selling it means it can't be replenished? This is as illogical as reversing the cause and effect of prices and indexes.

Therefore, price increases are a common principle in economics, but once human manipulation is skillfully applied, it is difficult to believe that it is justified.

For example: After August 19, many wholesale prices were limited, the prices of firewood, rice, oil, and salt did not move, and the salaries of public utilities and employees were also frozen, but retail stores still thought the price limits were a bit "that way"; for example, pork, not only did the wholesale price not exceed the limit, but the number of pigs slaughtered in September was 10,000 more than in August, but there were still black markets and shortages. In fact, it is because they were used to being left alone. I dare not deny that prices are alive, but it is indeed a fact that the price increases of many things are baseless and without standards. Furthermore, retailers are insiders, and they will never let wholesalers exceed the price limits, but ordinary consumers do not ask for receipts for every item they buy, so although the price limits are said to be strictly enforced, in reality, the retail prices of many things have already changed numbers several times after August 19. In the past few days, authorities have been focusing on the supply of materials, and many bosses are closing their doors with a smile, and "free trade" in the back door, with black prices and white prices, is all up to your discretion. Is business really that difficult?

Let's talk about rickshaws and maids: the former's rental fee is still 1.5 million legal tender per day, but the price of rickshaws has skyrocketed, so rickshaw pullers can now earn 10 yuan in gold certificates per day (many times higher than salaried workers); maids used to be paid with three or four dou of rice, which was very reasonable, but now that the price of rice is not moving, they no longer mention rice, but say that the market price is now 10 yuan or 15 yuan. I have no intention of criticizing the working class, but this situation and this mentality are enough to prove the general situation.

Price increases should not be illegal, but after careful study, they mostly belong to insatiable greed. If this continues, we who have frozen salaries will have to be slaughtered! What to do?

### Amazing Skill

— Yi Jun

A woman received her salary and was walking home, passing Jiangwan Road, when an elegant man in a Western suit took out a ten-yuan gold certificate and politely asked her, "Do you have two five-yuan bills? Please exchange them for me." The woman was kind-hearted and took out her salary to exchange for him. Unexpectedly, the man took the salary bag and said, "Let me see if there are any one-yuan bills." As he spoke, he flipped through the bills. After counting them one by one, he returned the salary bag to the woman, saying, "Never mind the exchange." With that, he strode away. When the woman got close to home, she felt that something was strange about what had just happened, so she took out the salary bag to check. To her surprise, four five-yuan bills were missing.

She told everyone in the office about this, and everyone who heard it was shocked. At this time, another man told an even more mysterious and astonishing story, which was also his own experience: One afternoon in a certain month last year, he carried two pockets full of banknotes, he didn't remember how much, but it was a large sum of money, enough to buy several stone of white rice. He was passing Nanjing Road, he didn't take the tram, and he didn't bump into anyone, but he didn't know when he was ambushed by criminals, and both pockets were empty. In Shanghai, no one knows how many people are living by this kind of amazing skill (1).

### Luxurious Deception

— Shi Wen

The greatest skill of power ministers has always been to deceive the ruler, keeping the person above in the dark so that they can boldly do evil.

Even the shrewd Empress Catherine of Russia was deceived.

In 1787, Marshal Potemkin of Russia reported to Empress Catherine that the newly conquered Crimea was already densely populated and prosperous. The empress was also very sharp. She knew that Crimea was originally a desolate place, and she became suspicious when Potemkin described it so well, so she insisted on seeing it for herself.

A few months later, Potemkin actually invited her to visit Crimea. She gladly accepted and boarded a ship to sail down the Dnieper River for 1,200 miles. Along the way, Potemkin kept pointing things out to her on the deck. She saw crisscrossing fields everywhere, and thriving farmland. The villages were also bustling with happy farmers.

Empress Catherine was very satisfied and did not go ashore. She ordered the anchor to be raised and returned to the Russian capital.

In fact, all of this was fake. The villages and towns were all built with scenery from the theater, and all the farmers were actors hired at a high price. At night, the scenery was immediately dismantled, and the actors rushed to the next section of the road overnight. When the ship arrived the next morning, the banks were bustling again, with a scene of peace and prosperity. The scenery was also set up, and the actors were wandering around again.

The shrewd and capable Catherine did not see through this deception. However, the ambitious Marshal Potemkin also spent a lot of money. At the exchange rate at the time, he spent 4 billion US dollars to rehearse this "play."

### Time Bomb

— Le

During the intense fighting of World War II, the US intelligence agents did their utmost to protect President Roosevelt's safety. Any gift sent to him had to undergo rigorous inspection before being given to the president. The leader of a South American country had a good relationship with Roosevelt and sent him a lot of food, but the sender was indeed well-intentioned, but German spies poisoned the food halfway through. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and everything was fine. Once, a postal worker suddenly called the police station to report that there was a package addressed to the president with a pendulum sound inside, which was quite suspicious and he wondered if it was a time bomb. Intelligence agents rushed to open it and found that it was indeed a time bomb. Everyone greatly rewarded the postal worker. Unexpectedly, after a few days, the postal worker was sent to a mental hospital by the authorities—

It turned out that after careful investigation by intelligence agents, they discovered that the person who sent the time bomb was actually the postal worker himself! In order to show off, he did not hesitate to violate the law and recklessly take risks. He was originally going to be sentenced, but later it was discovered that he had a mental illness, so he was sent to the hospital to take care of things.

### Random Notes from a Mouse Coming to the Study

Killing Ministers in Ancient Times

The corruption of rituals lies in teaching people to pretend, from which the idea of pretending as the center produces many rituals in history, which still make us laugh after thousands of years.

For example, in ancient times, killing ministers was considered an unfortunate event. If they had to use criminal punishment, they had to go through many dramatic rituals to imply the class nature of the law, and on the surface, they covered it up with the term "ritual."

In the Han Dynasty: if the prime minister was guilty, the emperor would send someone to hold a scepter and ride a white horse-drawn carriage, bestow cattle and wine, and a basin of water. The envoy would announce the disaster. When the envoy was about to leave, the prime minister would report that he was ill. Halfway through, the Shangshu would report that the prime minister was critically ill. The emperor would hold a funeral for him and stop the court for three days.

The pretense is already extremely ridiculous, and if we trace back to ancient times, it would be even uglier. The Book of Rites: "If a member of the royal family is guilty, the Dianren will report to the king, and the king will say, 'Pardon him.' The Shishi will say, 'No.' The king will say again, 'Pardon him.' The Shishi will say, 'No.' The king will say a third time, 'Pardon him.' The Shishi will not listen and run away. The king will send someone to force him, saying, 'Don't let it go too far!'"

All these ugly behaviors are enough to prove that the so-called ritual system in ancient times is not worth a penny after tearing off the mask. However, the bestowal of cattle and wine and the call for three pardons at least show that it was a common occurrence in ancient times for ministers and relatives to be guilty and to plead guilty. Today, when "punishments do not reach the noblemen" has almost become an absolute truth, it makes people deeply feel the distance of history from people!

### Autumn Insect Song

— He Tianjian

The moon throws a jade plate, and flying dew captures its special light. On a clear night in the second nine, I wander alone deep into the night. Across the garden, the grasses and trees grow thickly, and the sounds of countless insects are the same. Each sound is difficult to understand, and one cries endlessly in the night. The wind is like sorrow, but why sorrow when there is no wind? The rain is like weeping, but why weep when there is no rain tonight? The vast sky is clear and bright like a painting, O insects, O insects, how can you not know? The sky is clearer, the moon is brighter, and although the insects feel nothing, I am stirred by something. Sometimes the wind is rustling, and hearing it makes my sorrow disappear. Sometimes the rain is lonely, and hearing it does not invite hatred. I am not a person of separation, so how can I have the distant and eternal mountains of longing? I have no heart for being downcast, so how can I have the feelings of leaves falling and trees shaking? Why does the feeling of namelessness suddenly come tonight? It is not hate, nor is it sorrow; it is not joy, nor is it worry. Thoughts are lingering, and feelings are dense, but they are shaken and stirred endlessly! The insects are themselves, and I am myself; thoughts are thoughts, and calls are calls. The moon is bright south and north of the street, and the sky is clear east and west of the building!
