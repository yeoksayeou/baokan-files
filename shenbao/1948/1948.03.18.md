### Truman Explains the World Situation: Points Out Soviet Obstruction of Peace; Demands the United States Implement Universal Military Training

[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 17th (Broadcast), Washington Dispatch: President Truman attended a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives on the 17th, reporting on the serious situation in the world and making important statements on foreign policy. He pointed out that the emergency situation in Europe was caused by the cruel and ruthless actions of the Soviet Union. He urged Congress to pass the Universal Military Training Act and expedite the passage of the Marshall Plan for European Aid. In addition, he also requested Congress to fully support the newly formed alliance treaty of the five Western European nations to prevent any attack. He said: "The situation in the world today is not primarily due to the consequences of war. The main reason is that one country not only refuses to cooperate in creating a just and honorable peace, but also tries to obstruct it, brewing unrest." Regarding the five-nation alliance in Western Europe, the President stated: "I firmly believe that the United States will support free nations in an appropriate manner, depending on the needs of the situation. I am confident that since the free nations of Europe are determined to ensure their freedom, the United States will not lag behind and will fully support them to achieve this goal." The President further stated: "The latest developments in Europe have presented the United States with a problem of fundamental importance. At this time, action is of utmost importance and should not be hesitated, even though action inevitably involves risk." He emphasized that the United States will continue to support the United Nations organization and will try every method to achieve international coordination. He said: "In recent years, conferences held by various countries have drafted various agreements, based on which a just peace could have been achieved, but these agreements have been ignored and violated by one country. That country not only constantly obstructs the work of the United Nations, frequently using its veto power, but also uses various means to undermine the independence and democratic character of many countries in Eastern and Central Europe. However, not satisfied with this, it obviously intends to apply these methods to the currently free countries of Europe. The seriousness of the situation in Europe lies here. The tragic death of Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk has shocked the civilized world. At present, Finland is under pressure, and the future of the entire Scandinavian Peninsula is uncertain. Greece is under direct military attack by rebels. In Italy, a Communist minority is seeking to control the country. The United States should implement universal military training to maintain peace with strength. This action will be a great encouragement to other governments that are working to prevent communism." He believes that the Senate's passage of the European Recovery Program is a clear example of the effectiveness of democratic politics. Although the President strongly criticized the Soviet Union, he emphasized that the United States is willing to cooperate with all countries to achieve international understanding. The United States welcomes any country, whether it be the Soviet Union or other governments, that is willing to sincerely cooperate to maintain peace, and the door to cooperation remains open.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] President Truman reported to Congress on the progress of the U.S. Lend-Lease program (from its beginning until June 30th of last year), stating: "The United States provided Lend-Lease aid worth $48,395 million to 38 countries, of which China received $1,627 million, less than 5 percent."

[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] President Truman summoned Secretary of State Marshall, Secretary of Defense Forrestal, Secretary of Commerce Harriman, and State Department Soviet expert Bohlen, among other key figures, on the 16th to discuss everything. The meeting originally scheduled for the morning of the 17th with four congressional leaders has been cancelled.

### Soviet Aircraft Invades Bohai Territorial Airspace; Exceeds the Scope of the Sino-Soviet Agreement; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Will Lodge Another Serious Protest with the Soviet Union

[Our Newspaper Dispatch, Nanjing, 17th] Regarding the incident of the Sun Namin Civil Aviation Transport Brigade's aircraft being attacked by Soviet aircraft in the Bohai Sea, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs will lodge another serious protest against the Soviet side's response of the 13th. This note will be submitted to the Soviet side within days, reiterating that civil aviation enterprises' aircraft permitted by the Chinese government in China's territorial airspace should be safe and free. According to the agreement on Lushunkou in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, although it is stipulated that the Soviet Union has the right to station land, sea, and air forces in the naval base area, its task is only to protect the base and strengthen the security of China and the Soviet Union to prevent Japan from invading again. Therefore, the Soviet aircraft in Lushun invading the Bohai territorial airspace and harming passing aircraft has obviously exceeded the scope allowed by the agreement. Our side will demand that the Soviet side guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. At the same time,

Once decided, it will not be easily changed. (3) After the conclusion of the Sino-Australian and Sino-Hong Kong agreements, smuggling in southern China will definitely be reduced. (4) The Executive Yuan has not yet decided on the method of purchasing Annex 1 items with self-provided foreign exchange.

### Levying Special Relief Donations is a Semi-Compulsory Method

Xian Guang Talks to Reporters

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Director Dong Xianguang answered reporters' questions at a press conference on the 17th as follows;

Question: Is the decree on special relief donations implemented uniformly for both Chinese and foreigners?

Answer: Special relief donation is a temporary donation, not a tax, and only applies to Chinese people (including overseas Chinese) and does not apply to foreigners in China.

Question: What standards will be used when estimating the property value of special donation objects?

Answer: Since special relief donation is not a tax, the estimation of the property of the donor and the determination of the amount of the donation cannot be calculated according to the method of collecting taxes based on accurate investigations and legal standards, but the fundraising committee in each district will use their knowledge and local recognized wealth to persuade them to recognize the amount of the donation. The amount to be donated is equal to one-tenth of the family property for natural persons and one-twentieth of the assets for legal persons.

Question: What are the donation standards for legal persons and individuals who own real estate (factories, real estate, land, raw materials, production finished products, etc.)?

Answer: The regulations for the payment and disposal of in-kind special relief donations stipulate that the price of various in-kind items (real estate and movable property) should be evaluated based on the average price within one month from the date of notification of the approved donation amount. This evaluation work is composed of representatives from public opinion organs, courts, and land administration agencies.

Question: When implementing fundraising, what will happen if those who are indeed capable of donating delay or refuse to donate? How will the refusal to pay the donation be dealt with? Is the donation based on a voluntary or semi-voluntary method?

### The People's Political Council Passes a Resolution: Requesting the Capital Be Established in Beiping

North China National Assembly Representatives Urged to Strive

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 17th Dispatch] "Establishing the capital in Beiping, and renaming Beiping to Beijing," is a fervent hope of the people of North China. The Beiping People's Political Council, during its general meeting on the 17th, after a proposal by more than half of the councilors, enthusiastically passed the resolution and telegraphed the North China National Assembly representatives, urging them to unanimously strive for this during the National Assembly meeting. [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th Dispatch] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance stated: This year's profit-seeking enterprise income tax is being implemented using the estimated payment method. Previously, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce forwarded a request from various trade associations to be exempt from estimated payments. The Ministry of Finance has responded with the following: (1) This year's profit-seeking enterprise income tax is calculated based on six times the total income tax payable by each taxpayer in the previous year for estimated payment. The original amount was a temporary measure, and the tax amount will still need to be assessed according to the law, with refunds or additional payments as needed. Various tax revenues in the 37th year's budget have increased significantly. The profit-seeking enterprise income tax has increased approximately twenty times compared to the 36th year. The estimate of six times is still a low estimate. Considering commodity prices, the price index in the 36th year increased approximately fifteen times compared to the 35th year. Estimating payment at six times is actually only a portion of the tax payable. For businesses with no income or income less than six times the previous year, tax refunds will still be available according to the law, with interest added for the refund, so there is no impact on their burden. (2) The adoption of the estimated payment method for profit-seeking enterprise income tax was approved by the State Council as an emergency measure to strengthen tax collection and avoid delays. Subsequently, the income amount should still be investigated and the tax amount assessed according to the law, and the law has not been changed by order. (3) The business of the banking industry comes from the difference between deposit and loan interest and income from remittance and trust services. Although it does not involve the exchange of physical goods like other industries, the difference and income are calculated in currency, and it is undoubtedly affected by rising commodity prices. Therefore, even if the difference in interest rates between deposits and loans does not rise in proportion to commodity prices, the amount of deposits and loans and the surplus are closely related to the rise and fall of commodity prices. The banking industry has always been highly profitable, and its tax-bearing capacity is often above that of other industries. It should work together to overcome difficulties and promptly pay taxes according to the law. The above reply has been telegraphed to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and forwarded to the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau.

### Opening of the Central China Pacification Conference: Chairman's Instructions to Raise Vigilance, Group Discussions to Strengthen Military, Political, and Economic Coordination

The opinions of the speakers were synthesized, and it was generally believed that to strengthen the coordination of military, political, and economic affairs during the rebellion suppression period, certain provisions of past laws should be revised. The commander of the pacification area should be subject to the control of the provincial chairman in politics, and the politics and economy of the pacification area should be subject to the command and supervision of the commander of the pacification area, so as to achieve unified command. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM and was divided into group meetings: military, political, and economic.

More than 200 people from various parties attended. Fu Zuoyi and Chu Xichun personally presided over the meeting. Li Zongren, Wang Bingjun, and Liu Yao also attended and delivered speeches. Li Zongren hoped that the conference would discuss in detail the strengths and weaknesses of itself and the Chinese Communists, and regretted that many people today not only do not know the enemy, but also do not know themselves. Fu Zuoyi emphasized that suppressing bandits is only a matter of method. If psychological and methodological changes can be thoroughly made, victory is assured. He believes that the military must change its psychology from defending against bandits to fighting bandits, and the people must change from fearing bandits to helping the national army suppress bandits. In tactics, it is necessary to break the regularity and use flexibility to avoid being exploited by the bandit army. Finally, he proposed the goal of cultivating new cadres for suppressing bandits: to be able to write when picking up a pen, to be able to speak when opening their mouths, to be able to fight when picking up a gun, to be able to run when pulling their legs, to be able to think when encountering things, to not love mirrors, to be able to endure hardship and suffering, and to not be willing to be in the rear but willing to be on the front line. Subsequently, Chairman Chu Xichun briefly reported on the significance of the meeting, which aims to stabilize the local area and improve people's livelihood. The ceremony was completed at 10:30 AM. The meeting continued in the afternoon, with commissioners and county magistrates from various places reporting separately.

### How to Properly Handle Military Service in Shanghai

The Shanghai military service work for this year is scheduled to begin on April 1st. The Military Service Association is actively carrying out military service propaganda to assist civil affairs agencies and military service agencies in promoting military administration, calling on aspiring young men to enthusiastically enlist in the military. On the other hand, a lottery committee has been established to handle the lottery matters of eligible men, according to this year's method of complementing lottery and volunteering. Military service is a regular administrative matter for every family. Whether in peacetime or wartime, it is necessary to teach the people to fight and cultivate the power to defend the country and protect their homes. Shanghai's legal handling of military service began last year. Because of the difficulty in establishing a foundation in peacetime and the failure to implement mobilization during the Anti-Japanese War, Shanghai's military administration is more difficult than anywhere else. Now, young men all over the country are rising up to defend the country and protect their homes. Only Shanghai's mood is low, retreating step by step, without thinking of recovering, which is a disgrace to the citizens of Shanghai. The annual conscription is about to begin this year. It is hoped that Shanghai will have a good start and a good harvest this year, so that the spirit can be transferred and become a model for the whole country.

Military service is an essential element for the survival of an independent country. A country established with sovereignty has independent national defense, and therefore has its military service. In a country that is ruled and enslaved, the constitution does not stipulate that the people have the obligation to serve as soldiers, and state affairs do not allow for military administrative affairs, so there is no such thing as independent "national defense." On the contrary, a country with independent sovereignty depends on national defense to protect its territory and sovereignty and its people, and it depends on the army to defend it. Therefore, the constitution stipulates that the people have the obligation to serve as soldiers. The Soviet military service law stipulates that serving as a soldier is not only an obligation for the people, but also a right, and conscription is an honor. The Constitution of our country stipulates that all people have the obligation to perform military service. As for how to perform military service? It is specifically stipulated by the Military Service Law. During the eight years of our country's Anti-Japanese War, the soldiers on the front line were able to advance wave after wave, and the replenishment was not lacking, thanks to the implementation of the Military Service Law. After the victory and demobilization, the national military service was postponed for one year, and the Military Service Law was also partially revised at this time. The National Government promulgated and implemented it on October 10, 35th year, and issued a notice to the people of the country saying: "From October 10, 35th year, follow the revised military service laws and regulations and continue to implement them. All our citizens must know that military service is the natural duty of everyone, and must encourage each other to enthusiastically enlist, so that the foundation of military construction can be laid and the strength of national defense can be enriched." To assist in the implementation of the Military Service Law, the National Government promulgated and implemented the Military Service Law Implementation Law on February 19, 36th year, stipulating that the Ministry of National Defense is the competent authority for national military service. In recent years, the Ministry of National Defense has formulated many implementation guidelines for conscription in order to make military service cooperate with the suppression of the rebellion and military affairs, calling on aspiring young men to bravely join the army, so as to enrich the source of soldiers. In the past year, although the performance of military service in various places has not yet reached an ideal state, everyone knows that serving as a soldier is a duty.

Shanghai's handling of military service began last year. Because there was never a military service foundation established in the past, and most people did not have enough understanding of the Military Service Law, the trial conscription of volunteers was carried out first. After there were results and scale, according to the provisions of the Military Service Law, 2,943 people were conscripted by lottery, completing this experiment. This year, Shanghai's quota of soldiers is 6,000, which is double that of last year. In terms of Shanghai's population ratio, this number of soldiers is a good policy, and everyone should like it; if it is not handled well, everyone will hate it, and military service will become an oppressive government, which is extremely inappropriate.

How to handle military service properly? The first is to act according to the law, without favoritism or negligence; the second is to strive for three fairnesses: equality, fairness, and reasonableness. The above is the spirit of handling military affairs; as for the handling steps and the matters that should be paid attention to at present, there are the following points:

(1) Regarding the lottery, according to the decision of the Shanghai Military Service Conference on the 29th of last month, this year's military service will be carried out by combining lottery conscription and volunteer soldiers. That is to say, first carry out lottery conscription according to the Military Service Law, and then supplement it with volunteer soldiers. The lottery is a procedure of conscription. It is used to determine whether eligible men serve in the military and the order of entry. This is a very fair method. According to the provisions of the Military Service Law, the lottery must be carried out after background investigation, exemption investigation, and physical examination, so that there will be no confusion. It is heard that the conscription date of this city is scheduled for the 25th of this month, and now there is a saying that it will be changed to the 23rd. If the above conscription processing is not completed, and the conscription lottery is carried out in a hurry, there will inevitably be many technical problems to be remedied, which should be paid special attention to.

(2) Regarding conscription, conscription under the Military Service Law is handled by year of birth. This assumes that the household registration is correct and the population census is completed; if the household registration is not clear and the birth registration is not clear, it is extremely difficult to meet the actual situation to conscript by year of birth. It is heard that the implementation method of this year's conscription stipulates that in the first phase of conscription, one year of birth who are fully 20 years old (those born in the 16th year of the Republic of China) will be conscripted in order, and if the quota is insufficient, the year of birth will gradually be extended until the quota is met. Now the so-called lottery is to draw whether there are enough men who are fully 20 years old to meet the quota, which is not without doubt. Whether the men of Taian's age are evading, and whether the conscription is smooth, is even more doubtful. Shanghai has been promoting military administration for two years, and legal lottery is still a new initiative. In order to make the implementation effective and not empty words, the scope of the conscription year can be relaxed, which can reduce the situation of selecting labor and achieve the effect of conscription.

(3) Regarding preferential treatment, the so-called preferential treatment refers to the settlement expenses for men who join the army and the subsequent support for the family members. In the past, the funds for settlement expenses for new recruits were mostly taken from households without men going to war, or donated by wealthy families, which were not normal ways. It is heard that Shanghai is requesting the municipal government to allocate 5% of the income from public utilities and the banquet donation and entertainment items to raise funds for the settlement expenses of new recruits, which is undoubtedly a reasonable way to solve the source of funds for preferential treatment. However, settlement expenses are a one-time relief preferential treatment, and the government should be responsible for various rights and interests that the families of soldiers going to war should have in the future.

(4) Regarding volunteer soldiers, according to the research of military scientists and the experience of the United Kingdom and the United States in handling volunteer soldiers, volunteer soldiers are often troops with higher quality. Now our country's youth army is serving as volunteer soldiers. The current military service law of our country contains the spirit of volunteer soldiers, and volunteer soldiers should be promoted. Shanghai has a large number of educated youths. If they can be called to love the country and love their hometown, I believe that outstanding young men with professional duties will rise up and join the army. "A righteous man does not forget to be in a ditch, and a brave man does not forget to lose his head." The decisiveness of Nie Zheng in killing thieves is waiting to be recruited. We believe in the importance of educated youths volunteering to join the army. We hope that the military service authorities will seize the opportunity, call out loudly, and righteous people will follow one after another, which can be asserted.

In short, military service is an important policy of the country, and everyone has the obligation to perform military service according to the law. It cannot be avoided or borrowed. Today's country has entered an extraordinary period, and everyone must serve the country. Aspiring young men should especially make up their minds, rise up together, and participate in the movement to defend the country and protect their hometown, in order to fight for the survival of the country and the peace of the local area. Shanghai has superior conditions for promoting military administration. It is hoped that institutions at all levels will be determined to handle military service well, and the government should be integrated with the people. Soldiers come from the people, and the people are soldiers. Let us work together to defend the country and protect our hometown!

### International Children's Emergency Fund Allocates Funds to Relieve Chinese Child Refugees

$5.5 Million USD Already Paid

[Central News Agency, New York, 16th] The International Children's Emergency Fund has recently allocated $5.5 million USD to help impoverished children in China. The plan drafted by the Fund's delegation to China has been approved by the Fund's Planning Committee and will be used to purchase relief supplies for shipment to China. A Fund spokesperson said that the delegation to China, led by Junod, is expected to submit a report within the month. The $5.5 million USD will be used for ten months of refugee relief in China. The Executive Board of the International Children's Emergency Fund had previously allocated $3.5 million USD last year, and another $2 million USD was allocated last week. However, due to the United Nations' appeal for refugees, even more donations are pouring in, so China will receive even more funds in the future. The Fund has sent hundreds of shipments of relief supplies to Europe, but it has not yet provided any relief in China. Although the Chinese side has repeatedly protested to no avail, Fund officials stated that there are many reasons for the delay, the main one being that there is no finalized plan for China. The Executive Board, which has the final authority to approve work plans, has authorized the Planning Committee to draft a plan for China to save time.

### Looted Cultural Relics: Apply for Restitution Promptly

Ministry of Foreign Affairs Notifies the Nation

[This City Dispatch] During the War of Resistance, many valuable cultural relics of China and allied countries were destroyed or looted by the Japanese, and their whereabouts are unknown.

### Tainan Develops Agricultural Irrigation: Construction of the Touliu Canal Project; Land Improvement Project Undertaken Simultaneously

[Central News Agency, Tainan, 17th] Tainan County, which relies on irrigation to be Taiwan's granary, is proceeding with the construction of the Touliu Canal project in addition to the existing Jianan Canal. At the same time, a land improvement project is being undertaken to increase agricultural production. The planned main line of the Touliu Canal is 32 kilometers long, and the branch lines, large and small drainage canals, etc., will total 2,414 kilometers. If they were connected into one long waterway, it would be five times the length of the longitudinal railway from Keelung to Linbian plus 1417 kilometers, and it could also circle the entire island of Taiwan nearly three times. This project started on November 12th last year, and 2,800 workers are currently working on it every day. It is expected to take five years to complete, and the project cost is NT$1.445 billion, which is truly a major construction project after the war. Half of all costs are subsidized by the government, and the other half is shared by the beneficiary fields based on their benefit situation. The funds required during the construction period are advanced by the government, and the people's share is borrowed from local banks in the province. When the land yields increase, the people will repay in installments. After the entire project is completed in the future, the cultivated area can be increased by more than 24,000 mu, and the annual increase in production value is estimated to be over NT$3.65 billion. The increased value of the land itself is not included in this calculation. Tainan has a total area of 4,884 square kilometers, accounting for one-seventh of the province's area, and the annual output of the county's three major agricultural products – rice, sugarcane, and lotus root – often accounts for one-quarter to one-third of the entire province. In the future, after the completion of this nationally innovative Touliu land improvement project and the largest-scale Touliu Canal irrigation project in Taiwan since its retrocession, the development of Tainan County's agricultural economy is immeasurable.

### One Week War Situation Analysis Published by the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 17th] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released an analysis of the war situation from the 10th to the 16th on the 17th. The full text is as follows: Since the launch of the army expansion movement and the expanded military training movement last winter, followed by the "Three Examinations" movement of examining thought, class, and bloodline to consolidate the interior, the Communists have been preparing to launch a full-scale insurgency. In the past week, Communist troops have been active in various battlefields. The National Army, in response to the Communist actions, is concentrating its forces in the Northeast to respond to the overall strategy, and on the evening of the 9th, proactively withdrew from Yongji. Out of consideration for the lives and property of the people, no damage was done to the Xiaoti Man Power Plant, or even the ammunition depot in the urban area. The people of Yongji, knowing the cruelty and viciousness of the Communists, voluntarily endured the cold and long trek, bringing the old and young with them, preferring to leave their homes and follow the National Army in sharing hardships. This spirit of not wanting to be slaves and striving for freedom is truly earth-shattering. When the National Army was covering the retreat of the people and government agencies, it encountered the Communist Independent 9th Division, which attempted to obstruct them. Under the great joint attack of the military and the people, the Communists were defeated, and 914 prisoners were captured. By 10:00 AM on the 12th, all had safely arrived in Changchun, creating a miracle of retreat on the land of the Far East like Dunkirk.

As for the Communist forces in the Siping area, they used seven times the strength of the National Army. Since the 4th, it has been two weeks, and the Communist forces have suffered more than 20,000 casualties under the so-called "human wave" and "human bomb" tactics. The National Army achieved such a great price, and only withdrew from the urban area on the afternoon of the 15th, and is still scattered in the nearby suburban areas fighting the Communists. In North China, the National Army has been reporting frequent victories in the sweeping campaign in eastern Hebei for a week, achieving many results. The Communist forces in western Hebei, in order to support the disastrous defeat in eastern Hebei, have collected the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 5th Columns and repeatedly claimed that they would attack Baoding again, but after a tentative disturbance between Xushui and Baoding, they were defeated and retreated by the National Army. These days, they have disappeared again.

In Central China, Chen Yi, in order to reverse the disastrous defeat of his 11th and 12th Columns in Dongtai, northern Jiangsu, hurriedly transferred the 2nd Column from central Shandong and hurriedly fled south across the southern road, attempting to reinforce northern Jiangsu, but was attacked by the National Army along the way, and was unable to struggle in the area south of Xiaopu and north of Lianshui. At the same time, in order to contain northern Jiangsu, Chen Yi sent the 9th and 13th Columns, plus a new 8th Column and four guard regiments, a total of more than 40,000 troops, to launch a containment attack in Zhoucun, Huantai, Zichuan, and other places on the Jiaoji Railway, but so far, in addition to paying the price of more than 10,000 casualties, they still cannot shake Huantai and Zichuan. The main force of Chen Yi, the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns, have not been fully replenished, and were beaten by the National Army from western Shandong to eastern Henan, and then chased from eastern Henan to western Shandong. In the vicinity of Dancheng, they were fiercely attacked by the National Army. As of yesterday, there was almost no place for them to stand in western Shandong, and except for the two Guangdong columns, most of them had to sneak across the Yellow River and flee north.

In the Luoyang area, Chen Geng's 4th and 9th Columns and the 38th Army, as well as part of the 38th and 2 Columns of Chen Yi's forces that had fled from eastern Henan, a total of about 70,000 people, began to attack Luoyang from the 8th of the previous week. Our defending army, with less than a division of troops, resisted six times the number of Communist troops. On the 11th, the Communists also transferred the 8th Column from Shanxi to cross the river at Kuangkou and join the attack. Our heroic National Army fought bravely, one after another, killing more than 10,000 Communist troops. The Communists suffered heavy casualties, and part of them entered the urban area three days ago, but the National Army was still able to hold the core and the northwest corner of the position and continue to attack the Communists. Currently, the National Army reinforcements have arrived in the suburbs and are deploying to severely attack the Communists.

In the Northwest, the Communists began attacking Yichuan on the 8th, attempting to control Luochuan, but were attacked by the National Army and had to stop. On the 14th, Communist leader Peng Dehuai personally led the Independent Workers Brigade and the 2nd Column, more than 10,000 people, intending to bypass Pucheng. The National Army gave the Communists another heavy blow in the area north of Pucheng, forcing the Communists to turn north and retreat. Currently, most of the large Communist forces are heading west, and some have the appearance of going up Huanglong Mountain to become bandits. The National Army is advancing north from Tongchuan and Pucheng in separate directions.

The 3rd and 6th Columns of Liu's Communist forces in the Dabie Mountain area are still being annihilated by the National Army separately in the areas west of Yuexi, east of Jingfu, and north of Luotian and Macheng. More than 1,000 Communist troops have been killed or wounded in the past week. The 1st and 2nd Columns are still south of Shenqiu, northeast of Xincai, and near Linquan, attempting to flee north, joining forces with the 10th and 11th Columns, and continuing to harass the Yellow River Pan District. The National Army is attacking from the north and south. The recent suppression in this area has proven the strength of the people united with the National Army.

France's change of attitude has made the United Nations' plan for Palestine uncertain. The reason for France's change is unknown.

During yesterday's discussion, the four powers agreed in principle that a threat to peace did exist, but the United States, France, and the Soviet Union believed that this threat was caused only by the infiltration of armed personnel, while China believed that the infiltration of weapons, in addition to armed personnel, was also a cause.

### Municipal Council Holds Tea Party to Welcome Representatives Petitioning from Northeast - Decides to Allocate Winter Relief Funds to Aid Compatriots from Beyond the Pass - Mayor Wu Delivers Speech Expressing Deep Concern

[Our Newspaper Report] The joint tea party held by the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council to welcome the Northeast Petition Delegation was held at 3:00 PM yesterday in the Municipal Government Auditorium. It was hosted by Mayor Wu, and attended by Northeast Petition Delegation representatives Wang Huayi, Tian Yushi, Zhang Baozi, and former Chairman of Rehe Province Mi Chunlin, former Chairman of Hebei Province Wang Shuchang, Standing Supervisor of the Central Supervisory Committee Liu Zanzhou, Northeast Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association Shi Bingyan, and others. Speaker Pan was in Hangzhou and had not yet returned to Shanghai, so Vice-Speaker Xu Jiting attended. First, Mayor Wu expressed his welcome and delivered a speech stating: "The Northeast is China's veritable treasure land and the lifeline of China. Today, it is mired in war, and everyone from the central government to the people feels the deepest concern. Our emotions are heavy and cannot be expressed, but there is one thing I can say, which is 'Though our bodies are in the Southeast, our hearts are in the Northeast.'"

Then, Vice-Speaker Xu, representing the Municipal Council, reported that a decision had been made to request the government to strengthen the defense of the Northeast. Next, Northeast Petition Delegation representative Wang Huayi reported on the delegation's motives and experiences in petitioning, stating: "This time, representing the people of the Northeast to petition in Beijing, we know that its significance and mission are extremely important. The so-called Northeast problem is actually a national problem, which has a great impact on the entire China. The Northeast has great value in terms of national defense and economy. Its tangible wealth can be demonstrated with one example, namely, the Northeast's three-year soybean trade, which can recover the total amount of legal tender circulating in the country. The Northeast produces 5 million tons of soybeans annually, with each ton worth US$180. The amount accumulated over three years is staggering. Therefore, if China wants to stand tall as a nation, it cannot do without the Northeast. Today, the situation in the Northeast is deteriorating day by day. If the Communist bandits occupy the entire Northeast, the Communist government will be established immediately, and a large army can invade North China and even the entire China. At that time, what will the situation be? The Northeast is in danger, and we hope that the people of the country will provide assistance in a timely manner!"

Reporting the Results of the Petition

Wang continued to report on the results of the petition to Chairman Chiang, stating: "Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about the people of the Northeast. After the petition delegation met with him, the Chairman agreed to fully support them in terms of military affairs, food, and economy: (1) Military affairs: The central government will never change its overall plan for the Northeast, and the Northeast must be defended to the death. Those past strategies that should be revised will be revised immediately. In future strategies, in addition to focusing on military affairs, equal importance will be attached to the use of civilian power. (2) Food: The Food Department has decided to fully supply the people of the Northeast with food seeds. The food for March and April has been prepared. The only concern is the transportation issue, which is currently being actively addressed. The air route from Beiping to Shenyang has been shortened so that it can operate three times a day. (3) Economy: The government's original intention in issuing Northeast circulating coupons was good, but because the situation in the Northeast today is very different from the past, the total number of residents in the Northeast used to be 47 million, but now it is only 7 million, resulting in inflation and the people being oppressed and unable to breathe. Former Northeast elder Zhang Zuoxiang also suggested that the central government find ways to coordinate the Northeast monetary system with the rest of the country and control the currency value with the exchange rate. After consulting with the Food Department, there are concrete solutions."

Request to Fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty

Wang continued, "We also visited Foreign Minister Wang Shijie and Ambassador Stuart, requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty. Ambassador Stuart attached great importance to the trend of public opinion in the Northeast when he met with the petition delegation, and inquired in detail whether the people still maintained their consistent confidence in the central government. Wang concluded by appealing to all sectors with a full heart of sorrow, stating that the situation in the Northeast cannot be allowed to deteriorate further and that rescuing the Northeast is now extremely urgent."

Subsequently, Mayor of Shenyang Zhang Shici delivered a speech stating: "The solution to the Northeast problem depends on military success. The Northeast is the military center for suppressing bandits, Shanghai is the economic center for suppressing bandits, and Nanjing is the diplomatic center for suppressing bandits. How to coordinate the three to ensure the early success of bandit suppression?"

提出三點呼籲

Tian Yushi then made three appeals: (1) The Northeast issue is an integral whole, and it is hoped that the country will unify its will to save the Northeast. (2) Concentrate manpower and material resources to strengthen the central government's strength in suppressing bandits, and hope that Shanghai will set an example in suppressing bandits. (3) After the fall of Yongji, more than 300,000 righteous people retreated to Changchun with the national army, and they must be rescued immediately.

After the representatives from the Northeast finished speaking, Mayor Wu stood up and gave a concluding speech: (1) Saving the Northeast is saving ourselves. (2) For bandit suppression to succeed, the people of the whole country must wake up in time and unify their will. (3) To aid the refugees from the Northeast, the city's winter relief fund will allocate a portion to purchase food and supplies to aid the refugees from the Northeast. The transportation method will be discussed later. After hearing this, the Northeast Petition Delegation applauded to express their gratitude. Finally, Miss Song Guorui, on behalf of the Northeast Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association, presented flowers to Wang Huayi, a representative of the petition delegation. The tea party ended at 5:00 PM.

### Wage Issuance Based on Last Month's Index - Labor-Management Appraisal Committee Establishes Study Group

[Our Newspaper Report] The Shanghai Industrial Association has formally submitted a document to the Bureau of Social Affairs requesting a uniform regulation that the wages of workers in all factories be settled according to the cost of living index for the previous month. At the same time, the Stack-Manufactured National Goods Factory Federation also submitted a document to the Bureau of Social Affairs, stating that they cannot bear the burden due to the high cost of living index and requesting the formulation of fundamental solutions. The Bureau of Social Affairs has forwarded the two documents to the Labor-Management Appraisal Committee, which has decided to establish a group with the Industrial Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, and the Labor Association to convene a meeting at a later date for detailed study.

A spokesperson for the Industrial Association issued a statement yesterday stating: "Recently, newspapers have often published reports stating that the Industrial Association has requested the freezing of workers' cost of living index, etc. This is not in accordance with the facts. The board of directors and supervisors of the Industrial Association only made a resolution to the effect that 'in order to enable factories to predict costs and avoid closing due to losses, the government should rigidly stipulate that the wages for this month be issued according to the cost of living index for the previous month.' They never requested the freezing of the index."

### American-owned Electricity Company - Hosts Reporters for Visit

[Our Newspaper Report] The American-owned Shanghai Electric Power Company at Yangshupu provides 80% of the city's total electricity. The Shanghai Electric Power Company first generated electricity in 1913, and has a history of 35 years to date. In the former concession era, it was originally the Electrical Department of the Municipal Council. In 1929, it was sold to Americans at the same time as the telephone company and became an American-operated enterprise. However, all organizations comply with Chinese company law and are subject to the Public Utilities Bureau of the Municipal Government. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the company specially invited the press to visit. The company's President and Vice President, TC Pleace (American) and Kaec (Czech), received the reporters in the reception room. First, they used simple and clear slides to explain the steps of power generation, which included the following parts: (1) 18 different generators in the factory, (2) Coal is transported by barge (3) Coal crane—lifting coal from the ground to a high place and then into the furnace, (4) Coal mill—large pieces of coal need to be ground into coal dust before they can be used for combustion, (5) Pump—the water of the Huangpu River is pumped into use, (6) Oil pump—diesel oil is also one of the main fuels, and diesel oil also needs a pump to transport it, (7) Coal dust furnace—some furnaces use coal dust as fuel, (8) Coal dust is transported by spiral conveyor. After viewing the slides, the reporters were then guided to various departments for a practical visit. Thanks to the guidance of the slides, the reporters were very clear about the initiation of electricity. The original power for electricity generation is water and fuel. The pumping station of the electric power company is built at the bottom of the Huangpu River so that the water of the Huangpu River can be fully utilized and circulated continuously. The main fuels are coal dust and diesel oil, which turn water into steam to drive the generator to generate electricity. The variety of mechanical equipment in the electric power company and the effectiveness of its coordination are quite amazing to laymen. Although the company consumes a large amount of coal and diesel oil every day, the company currently has a sufficient supply of coal, which can last for about one month. Even if the coal supply is cut off, it can still generate electricity with diesel oil, so the people of Shanghai do not need to worry about the supply of electricity.

The quota number and method, it is learned: the bureau allocated the quota in accordance with the central government's regulations, dividing the total number of active-duty and eligible men in the city by the number obtained, and then multiplying the number of active-duty and eligible men in each district by the quotient, which is the number allocated to each of the above districts. On average, one out of every thirty-eight eligible young men is drafted. A person in charge of the bureau said yesterday that the twenty-six extra people drafted for the first time this year can offset the quota for next year (or the next time). As for the fifty-seven people who have not yet been drafted last year, they will be separately investigated and supplemented by the districts with shortages during this conscription and will not be added to the quota for this time.

### Households Without Conscripted Men - Collect Preferential Fees in Four Grades - Receipts Not in Compliance Can Be Reported to the Military Association

[Our Newspaper Report] The Shanghai Military Service Association has set a standard for preferential fees for households without conscripted men, divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. Grade A is 300,000 yuan per household, Grade B is 100,000 yuan per household, Grade C is 50,000 yuan per household, and Grade D is 30,000 yuan per household. The association prints receipts and distributes them to the district Bao for collection. In order to distinguish the receipts, Grade A is printed on red paper, Grade B is printed on green paper, Grade C is printed on yellow paper, and Grade D is printed on white paper, with the words "Grade A, Grade B, Grade C, Grade D" printed on the top of the receipts. The association is now dispatching personnel with the Bureau of Civil Affairs to supervise the collection. If the amount paid by a household without a conscripted man last year does not match the color of the receipt or if there is no receipt for the collection, it can be reported directly to the Military Service Association to prevent abuses.

### The Middle Class Should Quickly Unite - Urge the Government to Complete the Suppression of Rebellion - Hope that Chinese and Foreign People Will Pay Attention to the Overall Situation and Strive to Save the Situation - Speaker Pan Publishes Important Speech

In the past half month, prices have soared, the cost of living index will inevitably rise, and industry and commerce are feeling difficult. The fact that American aid has not yet been seen is causing increasing unease among the people. The reporter specially visited Speaker Pan Gongzhan to inquire about his opinions. Pan replied: "The Municipal Council had a serious discussion on this issue during the meeting and made suggestions that the foreign exchange rate should not be raised at any time, that a linked import and export system should be adopted, that exports should be encouraged, that overseas remittances should be subsidized, that the prices of public utilities should be stabilized, etc. I believe that if drastic measures are taken and there is a determination to do it, it will be possible to save the situation, or at least stop the rising trend. Unfortunately, the authorities have not yet paid attention to public opinion and are still following the old ways, resulting in (1) foreign exchange, (2) prices, and (3) wages rising in a cycle without any improvement. From March of last year to February of this year, prices have risen at least twenty times in one year, which is far more than the five times or so in the previous year. We really don't know what the responsible authorities have been doing in this year to cause this."

Human Factors Need to Be Reviewed - In the current overall situation, we must, on the one hand, appeal to the United States that military and economic aid to China should go hand in hand and that time is of the essence. On the other hand, we should strive to reform all facilities in politics, economy, and military affairs. Otherwise, like a patient who refuses to see a doctor, what good will foreign aid do even if it is obtained? Doesn't the recent rise in grain prices despite the arrival of American grain and the rise in cotton prices despite the arrival of American cotton show this? The human factors in this need to be reviewed by ourselves. The Municipal Council sent a memorandum to the United States on March 6, appealing for aid to China. The memorandum suggested that the military budget for our country's suppression of communists, including ammunition, grain, and clothing, should be separated from the ordinary budget and that the aid should be used to support the military budget. In this way, the ordinary budget will definitely be balanced with a surplus, and there will be no need to issue more currency. With a stable currency value, people will be at ease, and everything can gradually get on track. At this time, we should also exert public opinion and supervise the central and local governments to promote political and economic reforms.

Thorough Reform Coupled with American Aid - As for the military supply system, it should be strictly independent to ensure that there are no abuses and that military expenses do not flow into the market and become speculative capital. In short, we must have thorough reforms that are coupled with the actions of American aid. After the adjournment of the fifth meeting of the Municipal Council, I invited people from the education, culture, industry, commerce, and finance sectors of this city to conduct detailed discussions based on this direction. The discussions are still ongoing, and suggestions will be made soon. Because the current situation is so serious, intellectuals, those who live on salaries, and the middle class, who have always been the security force of society, must quickly unite and contribute their opinions and abilities to urge the government to complete the mission of suppressing the rebellion. Otherwise, after being destroyed by the communists, China will inevitably become a vassal of a totalitarian communist country, and the maintenance of world peace will also be in danger. I hope that Chinese and foreign people will pay attention to the overall situation and strive to save the situation.

### Insatiable Greed for Stolen Goods: Uncle Participates in Robbery; A Group of Robbers from Sheng County Arrested After Thorough Investigation; Confessed to Participating in the Robbery of a Foreign Woman's Home

[Our Report] At approximately 10:00 AM on the 8th of this month, the Hongkou Police Station received a phone call from Gongji Hospital reporting that Chen Shouqi, at No. 4, Lane 159, Jiulong Road, was injured after jumping from a back building's window during a robbery and was seeking treatment at the hospital. The Deputy and Assistant Directors of the station, Li Zhizhang and Yin Zhenming, along with Criminal Division Chief Xu Shibin, officers Wang Songyue, Gan Zhang Yongchang, and Zhang Yonglai, rushed to the scene to apprehend the bandits, but they had already fled. After investigation, it was learned that the residence at No. 4, Lane 159, Jiulong Road, belonged to Zhou Dejun. At around 10:30 AM that morning, four robbers entered through the back door, brandishing firearms, warning against making any noise, and forcing all residents into a back room, tying them up with ropes. One robber guarded them with a gun while the others ransacked the house for half an hour before fleeing. Chen Shouqi, one of the residents, struggled free from his restraints and jumped from an upstairs window, resulting in a foot injury. He then took a taxi to Gongji Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the victim, Zhou Dejun, discovered that five gold bars, two diamond rings, 550 US dollars, four gold rings, and watches and legal tender, all hidden in the cupboard, had been stolen. Chief Xu and Officer Wang interrogated Zhou Dejun and learned that Zhou had an uncle, Zhou Lansheng, who had worked as a tailor in Zhou's home last winter. He left after completing his work at the end of the year. On the 4th of this month, Lansheng returned to Zhou's house to borrow one million legal tender, but only borrowed 500,000, expressing dissatisfaction and leaving disgruntled. Furthermore, it was learned that the robbers all spoke with a Sheng County accent, which was the same as the victim's hometown, leading them to believe that Lansheng was involved in the case. Chief Xu planned to conduct a discreet investigation among the people of Sheng County and dispatched officers Wang Songyue, Ye Zhengxing, and Zhang Yongchang to investigate various Yue Opera venues. Sure enough, at around 10:00 AM on the 9th, a man named Li Liangchen from Sheng County was apprehended backstage at the Baxianqiao Empire Yue Opera Theater and taken to the station for questioning, where he confessed to participating in the robbery. The case officers then took him to the home of Qiu Chunfu at No. 3, Lane 25, Wangting Street, where they found two large gold bars, 40 US dollars, a handgun, and other stolen goods such as gold rings and cash. Further thorough investigation revealed that an accomplice, Yin Xitang, was planning to flee to Sheng County. At around 11:00 PM on the 11th, officers followed him by car to Xiaoshan County, where they spotted Yin waiting for a bus at the Xiaoshan bus station and immediately arrested him. They found 140 US dollars, two gold bracelets, and twelve gold rings in his suitcase and brought him back to Shanghai, where he also confessed to participating in the robbery. According to their confessions, an accomplice, Shen Jifa, had relatives living at No. 52 Qing'an New Village, Jumen Road. Officers were dispatched to arrest Shen's aunt, Gu Yazhen, and seized a Mauser pistol used in the robbery and a gold ring at her home. She confessed that her brother-in-law, Shen Jifa, had likely fled to his father-in-law's home in Shigaotang Village, Zhenhai. Consequently, disguised officers, along with Gu, traveled to Zhenhai by the Jiangjing Ferry at 5:00 PM on the 13th, arriving at 6:00 AM the next morning.

### Riot Case at Shenxin No. 9 Factory: Case File Transferred to Special Criminal Court Yesterday

[Our Report] The case of the worker riot at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory has been investigated by the Shanghai Police Department.

### Trial Opens in Lawmaker Election Case: Wang Jian'e and Cao Jun Deny Illegal Activities

[Our Report] Elected Shanghai legislator Wang Jian'e and first runner-up Cao Jun were recently sued by Huang Minhou, Zhang Qingshan, Dai Yun (female), and others, accusing them of election fraud and requesting confirmation that the election was invalid. Yesterday, President Zhang Qinglan of the High Court opened a second civil court for a public hearing. The plaintiffs' grounds for the complaint were: Wang Jian'e is a member of the Kuomintang, but he was not nominated by the Shanghai Party Headquarters, and he is currently the district chief of Xincheng District, which makes him ineligible to run for election according to law. Cao Jun had more votes than voters in the Zhenru area, and it should be ruled invalid. Yesterday, the defendants hired lawyers Jiang Pingfan and Huang Jiyuan to defend them in court. They presented documents proving that "Although the number of votes in Zhenru election was more than the number of issued votes, the total number of votes in the city was still consistent. It was obviously caused by the misplacement of votes from other polling stations, and should not be considered invalid votes." Regarding Wang, they argued that the elected district chief is eligible to run for election according to the regulations of the Ministry of Interior. The plaintiffs requested that the High Court send a letter to the Control Yuan to review the report of the Control Committee members He Hanwen and Fan Zhengbo, who investigated election fraud in the city, as a reference for the trial of the case. The court announced that the case would be continued on the 25th.

[Our Report] The British Tram Workers' Union held a member representative meeting on the 12th of this month to discuss how to negotiate with the company to resolve the outstanding issues related to employee benefits over the past two years. It was decided to put forward four specific demands: (1) Employees who were forced to leave during the enemy and puppet period should have their treatment, seniority, and pension restored after repatriation. (2) Employees should be granted special leave: 7 days for one year of service, 10 days for five years, and 14 days for ten years or more, with wages paid as usual and calculated according to the January cost of living index. (3) Semi-skilled workers in the mechanical department who pass the assessment and become technicians should also have their wages adjusted. (4) The year-end salary increase for staff last year was two yuan less than the base salary of the previous year, and should be compensated. They also set a deadline of 6:00 PM yesterday for a response, stating that they would take action immediately if the deadline was exceeded. The company felt that it was difficult to meet these demands, so it appealed to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. Yesterday morning, Zhao Banfu, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, summoned four representatives of the union, Chou Changjiang, Que Yangtian, Xu Shijian, and Chen Chunshi, to the bureau for mediation and offered sincere guidance. The four representatives stated that the four demands were the decision of the representative meeting and they had no right to change them, and their attitude was very firm.

### Hangzhou! Where to Go?

[This Newspaper's Hangzhou Fifteenth Dispatch] "Three winter months rely on one spring," once spring arrives in Hangzhou, the people living by the West Lake happily welcome the season for making money. Even the municipal government's major income relies on things like spring banquet donations to make up for the city treasury for the year. On the surface, this bright spring seems to be beneficial to Hangzhou, but in reality, upon careful consideration, it cannot avoid being a kind of humiliation. It seems that Hangzhou has no other way but to rely on spring tourists for its prosperity.

When we study history, Hangzhou's rise as a capital city was not necessarily due to the scenic West Lake.

Looking at the situation during the Tang and Song Dynasties: "Houses and mansions are magnificent, numbering over one hundred thousand," Marco Polo even said there were 1.6 million households. The population was especially flourishing, and the city's waterways were clear and unobstructed, with large ships able to pass through without hindrance. From the North Gate, one could go deep into the city center, and there were thousands of warehouses along the river specifically for storing goods. Products from all directions gathered here, and business on the main streets continued day and night. Only in the third or fourth watch of the night did the number of tourists begin to dwindle, and at the rooster's crow in the fifth watch of the morning, the market sellers were already opening their stalls. It can be said that Hangzhou's rise as a major city was due to the gathering of merchants. At the same time, Hangzhou's handicraft industry was also exceptionally developed. During the Song and Yuan Dynasties, it was the center of the nation's handicraft industry, and the "Record of Youmei Hall" contains phrases such as "their customs are skilled and ingenious." Therefore, Hangzhou at that time was the leading province in the southeast, as well as the leading province in the entire country. In the twelfth century, the Southern Song Dynasty was the most prosperous in the world, making it the world's largest metropolis. Marco Polo, after the fall of the Southern Song Dynasty, still steadfastly regarded it as "the most beautiful and magnificent city in the world" - "the Great City." In the Tang, Song, and Yuan eras, it can be said that Hangzhou did not rely on nurturing from foreign tourists. Instead, it possessed its own manufacturing handicraft industry and flourishing commercial conditions.

From the Ming and Qing Dynasties onwards, the handicraft industry was defeated by the mechanical industry, and the metropolis of Shanghai, closer to foreign lands, was established. Hangzhou's position was no longer as important as before. By the Republican era, Shanghai's developed industry and commerce caused Hangzhou to become

a dependency of Shanghai, relying on Shanghai for everything. Clever people in Hangzhou used the scenery to attract tourists to pass these peaceful years.

Judging from the current trend of Hangzhou, it certainly will not have an industrial future. Similarly, its commercial future will not surpass Shanghai for some time. And some of the so-called Hangzhou local products are not actually produced by Hangzhou itself. For example, walnuts are produced in Changhua, Chinese torreya nuts are produced in Xiaoshan, bamboo baskets are produced in Yuhang and Lin'an, and bamboo shoots are produced in Lin'an and Yuhang. So Hangzhou itself has very few specialty products. Even the so-called tea leaves are supplied by Hangxian, Yuhang, Shaoxing, and other counties. As for factories, if compared with Shanghai, they are far behind. Some people believe that the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the upcoming navigation of the Qiantang River can help

Hangzhou's development. However, if Hangzhou itself does not have industrial construction, then Hangzhou's prosperity will only be a commercial transit point, and its economic value will not be significant. If we want industrial construction, then things like coal, electricity, and raw materials cannot immediately

be connected. It's truly easier said than done. Its innate conditions are really felt to be insufficient.

Not long ago, the Hangzhou City Council and the Zhejiang Provincial Government repeatedly requested the central government to make Hangzhou

a municipality directly under the central government. Their reasons were: "Hangzhou is close to Nanjing and Shanghai, and far from Anhui and Jiangxi. Wheels and rails converge, and transportation is convenient. Since the completion of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge, it has indeed controlled the key hub of water and land transportation in the southeast. Products from all regions gather here, so it economically forms a link in the national center region. As for scenic spots and scenery, they are especially known throughout the world." This means that Hangzhou does not have its unique personality. Let's look at Nanjing: it is a political city. Shanghai is an economic city. Beijing is a cultural city. They all have their unique personalities. We also revealed the current state statistics of Hangzhou above. In these statistics, there is nothing that is particularly emphasized. Therefore, we can know that Hangzhou is still extremely ordinary. Some people say that Hangzhou can become

a garden city, a place for Chinese and foreign people to visit. However, if it is only trees, flowers, pavilions, and buildings, without enriching its spirit and content, then tourists will also find it extremely ordinary. We know that the garden city of Geneva in Switzerland has put a lot of effort into its cultural cultivation. They have many prestigious academies established there. But in our Hangzhou, there are two universities, the highest institutions of learning, and two specialized schools, while cultural activities are unusually desolate.

Hangzhou's innate conditions are not suitable for being a commercial and industrial metropolis. On the contrary, Hangzhou's naturally quiet environment is suitable for research, cultivation, and writing. Therefore, we believe that it should be built into an ideal cultural city. The reporter had a long conversation with Professor Zhang Qiyun of Zhejiang University about the Hangzhou cultural city

ideal construction. He believes that houses can be built on the mountain peaks surrounding West Lake and along the Qiantang River for cultural workers to live and research, which will be cool even in the summer. I believe that research institutions should be established in Hangzhou. At the same time, cultural workers should be welcomed to live here. People in Hangzhou should not only cater to high officials and wealthy merchants but should especially respect cultural workers, and cultural activities should also be particularly strengthened. If Hangzhou really becomes an ideal cultural city, then the name of a municipality directly under the central government does not only need to be sought in political advancement, but its actual spirit will be incomparably sublime.

### The Sheng Meizhen Case Causes Additional Problems; The Lu Family is Destroyed; The Corpse Awaits Re-examination

### Xinjiang and Taiwan; Kanbara Khan Visits Caoshan

Saying "Willing to Live Here"

[This Newspaper's Taipei Sixteenth Air Dispatch] The Xinjiang dance troupe's journey east, from the northwest corner of China to the southeast corner of China, traversing the mainland hinterland and the Taiwan Strait, is magnificent.

After the Retrocession, the earliest relationship between Taiwan and Xinjiang was with General Zhang Zhizhong, who said that the construction of Taiwan should be moved to the Great Northwest. The second was Commissioner Boerhan, who was working on the construction of Taiwan and women, considering it the best phenomenon. The next would be the thirty-eight members of the Xinjiang Dance Troupe, the "Cultural Envoys." The Uyghurs, who grow up at the foot of

the Tianshan Mountains in the desert region, have a great dream of the sea. But when they crossed the treacherous strait, they were conquered by the sea. Not one of them was not seasick, and they collapsed as soon as they landed. There is a distance from the desert to the sea. In this long distance, the historical handshake between the people of the two poles is meaningful.

In the island province, they are exposed to the rare and novel

tropical scenery. Everyone is holding . The warmth of the climate, the lush green color, and the flowers that bloom in all seasons will make them forget their desert hometown. After visiting Caoshan, Kanbara Khan even said: "Willing to live here!"

People from the mainland and local Taiwanese people are watching this group of tourists with surprised eyes. But the language, clothing, and appearance make the ethnic groups maintain a considerable degree of estrangement, unable to be immediately close. But in dance performance and the promotion of art, they gradually from understanding, resonate. Taiwanese people have a higher level of artistic cultivation.

They spent five days accepting welcomes from the Provincial Information Office, the Symphony Orchestra, the Senate, and others. On the fourteenth and fifteenth, they met with the Taiwanese people at Jiashantang with dance. On the sixteenth, they went to Taijia and Tainan to visit Sun Moon Lake and Chihkan Tower. They are also preparing to perform two more performances in the south. Receiving a grand welcome from all walks of life in the provincial capital is unprecedented.

The provincial government did not make a large-scale reception for this trip. They almost completely

relied on ticket sales to maintain their travel life. They can be called a touring performance dance troupe from the frontier.

Taiwanese people are estranged from the mainland. The arrival of the Xinjiang Dance Troupe will give the island new stimulation and influence in the recognition and cultural communication between ethnic groups. I believe that they will have a better stable impression of Taiwan's construction and take it to the Great Northwest. These two east-west sea and land gateways, these two edge ties, are linked together and closely connected! (This Newspaper's Special Correspondent Ding Mu Yun)

### From the "Locust Policy" to the Xuzhou Refugees

[This Newspaper's Xuzhou Fourteenth Dispatch] Due to its location and transportation, Xuzhou has become a city of refugees in name and reality. Righteous people exiled from Southern Shandong, Western Shandong, Eastern Henan, and Northern Jiangsu are all gathering in this big city, hoping to use the convenient and economical railway transportation to seek a livelihood in other safe cities. The highest recorded number of refugees concentrated in Xuzhou last year was as high as 220,000! The creation of artificial refugees is one of the strategies of the bandit army, which they call the "Locust Policy." Their intention is to deceive hundreds of thousands of women and children refugees into the government area, making them responsible for all the food and clothing expenses of these hungry people and unable to use their manpower. The astonishing consumption of food and other things, continuing for a long time, will greatly weaken the government's material strength, and its harm is like that of locusts to crops."

Transforming Refugees into Citizens

In theory, there are no refugees in Xuzhou today. Because starting last spring, the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Jiangsu Provincial Government jointly decided to encourage righteous people to organize armed returning home teams to follow the government army into the recovered areas of Southern Shandong and Northern Jiangsu to rebuild their destroyed homes. For those who did not want to return home and wanted to stay in Xuzhou for a long time, the municipal government set out a method of "transforming refugees into citizens." After compiling temporary Baojia, the central and local governments are no longer responsible for relief. This policy has been implemented for a year, so when Mayor Luo of Xuzhou answered the questions of the press corps, he said that the refugees who had gathered in the city in the past had all become citizens, which is completely correct in theory. But has the refugee problem really been solved in fact? This can be seen from two aspects: First, the armed returning home teams had high expectations at the beginning of their organization, but after implementation, there were many problems. First of all, the self-defense ability of the returning home teams themselves is weak, completely relying on the protection of the army. But the army is often mobilized, and many counties in the war zone have been captured and overcome, which can be repeated three or four or even seven or eight times. In this case, the armed righteous people who returned home became the target of revenge by the bandit army, and their tragic experiences are unbearable to describe. Many righteous people who had already returned home, therefore, traveled long distances and returned to Xuzhou. This is the first situation.

Visiting the Righteous People's Area

Those righteous people who are willing to live in Xuzhou for a long time, they have become "citizens" in name, but what is their daily life like? In the five old refugee-concentrated areas in Xuzhou, the reporter also chose the largest one near the old airfield, with the gracious assistance of Lu Zong and the municipal government, to conduct a field investigation. My suspicion was confirmed.

This area has now been compiled into thirty-four and thirty-five Baos, with a total of 13,867 residents. They are all from Shandong and Northern Jiangsu, and in the past, it can be said that they all had meager assets. They began to be exiled in Xuzhou in the spring of thirty-five. After arriving, they built some houses on the site of the airfield with their own financial and human resources as shelters. The local Su Ning Relief Branch had allocated 100,000 yuan per household as subsidies. Due to the inequality of wealth, these righteous people's buildings are either more habitable adobe houses or thatched huts that are only one or even half a person tall, and the former only accounts for one-fifth of the total. One year later today, their living conditions have become unbearable. The light and air of the adobe houses are no longer discussed, but they are still suitable for human survival. As for the thatched hut area, one immediately feels like they are in hell as soon as they enter. The thatched hut is about three or four feet high, and the building materials are thatch and mud. Because the door is low, people have to crawl in and out. Some firewood and grass are spread on the ground, which is considered a bed. A thatched hut may house six or seven adults and children. This is already struggling on the edge of the human survival line. There is no hygiene to talk about, let alone decency. The thatched hut cannot cover the wind and rain. In these four days, Xuzhou's wind and rain are bitter and cold, and the women and children in the thatched hut are crying. I witnessed two dead bodies being buried in the midst of their families' crying. The living are also disheveled and unrecognizable.

Tragic Daily Life

Their food is bean cake mixed with sweet potato slices, which is the best, but it is not easy to obtain. After three days of rain, many people went hungry. After the arrival of American relief supplies in China, the Ministry of Social Affairs allocated twelve tons of wheat to the charitable organizations here to provide relief to the refugees here in the form of porridge. It is stipulated that each person can receive twelve taels per day, barely maintaining their lives. But the problem is that there is little porridge and many monks. In the area I visited, the population is 13,867, of which only fifty have received porridge relief!

The reporter only visited one area, but the situation in other areas can also be imagined. When the sweltering day comes, these thatched hut areas will inevitably become the source of the epidemic. Any conscientious person who witnesses the inhuman lives of these compatriots will sympathize with them and worry about them. The handling of refugees is an extremely serious issue. These are the refugees who have already settled down, and their lives are so hard, it is really unimaginable for those who are in exile. Recently, the bandit army in Northern Jiangsu has again moved. After Shuyang and other places were captured, 150,000 refugees were displaced and fled to the government military area to seek relief and protection. It is now reported that 110,000 people have arrived in Suqian. The local government troops, witnessing the suffering of their compatriots, out of human sympathy, automatically reduced their diet by one day to provide relief. Now, most of these refugees are heading towards Xuzhou. How to resettle and relieve them has become a major problem for the military and political organs here. Because the counties under Xuzhou already deeply feel the severity of the food shortage, they are now trying various ways to ask the Four Joint Offices for funds to purchase food. If they are unprepared and allow a large number of difficulties to enter, serious incidents will occur.

New Refugee Problems

The Xuzhou military and political authorities have been resettling the righteous people based on a principle instructed by the central government, which is that the righteous people can be dispersed to the east, west, and north, but they cannot take Jinbei cars to the south. Now, Xuzhou has five or six hundred new refugees arriving every day. The Ministry of Social Affairs has now allocated 1 billion yuan and 23 tons of flour to carry out relief and diversion work. There are two diversion stations here. When the righteous people arrive, they are responsible for their food and lodging, and they are given 30,000 to 50,000 yuan for travel expenses to send them back to their hometowns by free car. If they are homeless, they will be sent to live temporarily in the homes of relatives. According to the staff, most of the refugees hope to go to the Beijing-Shanghai area, where it is easier to make a living, but this is not possible now. Under the current situation, everything is a temporary measure, and a fundamental solution is really out of the question.

The central government's reluctance to allow refugees to go south has its own difficulties because the political and economic heartland south of the Yangtze River today cannot tolerate any disturbance. In fact, in terms of employment opportunities, righteous people who are unfamiliar with the people and places in Jiangnan may not be comforted either. The righteous people in the thirty-four Baos here have now proposed a self-help method, including the establishment of refugee schools, refugee markets, small loan cooperatives, job placement agencies, hospitals, and household registration statistics, and have submitted them to the Xuzhou military and political organs for approval. This is worthy of sympathy from the social community. At the same time, on the other hand, powerful people in safe areas today should also bravely help others. If they have the opportunity to see the suffering of the righteous people here and think about the overall situation today, it will not be difficult to realize that leveling the distance between people's lives is the fundamental way to maintain this social system.

### Tourists Flock to the Taihu Lake Scenic Area

[This Newspaper's Wuxi Sixteenth Dispatch] Wuxi is a scenic city with developed industry and commerce, bordering the 36,000-hectare Taihu Lake. The lake water is vast and clear as a mirror, and there are seventy-two small islands dotting it, so it is called a blessed land. Famous scenic spots such as Yuantouzhu, Xiaojishan, Liyuan, Meiyuan, Yuzhuang, Shijie Bridge, Huiquan Mountain, Xishan, Xuelang Mountain, and Jiangshan have picturesque scenery that can attract tourists to linger. Moreover, transportation is convenient, with roads reaching all directions. During this spring season, tourist groups from all over the world travel to the Taihu Lake scenic area in groups, one after another, and many have the feeling of being happy and forgetting to return. Taihu Lake has abundant products, such as water chestnuts, lotus roots, fish, and shrimp, all of which have delicious and palatable flavors. Recently, tourists from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line have been arriving in an endless stream. Note: There are more than 100 inns in Xiyi, most of which are near the railway station along Tongyun Road. The largest range is the Taishan Hotel (near the Gongyun Bridge), the China Hotel (Tongyun Road), and the Jinghu Hotel (Tongyun Road). The next are Zhongnan, Huizhong, Xinhua, Garden, Nanyang, Park, and more than ten others. The highest daily room rate is around 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, and the lowest is around 200,000 yuan. The oldest brand of restaurants is Jufengyuan. The store is located outside the north city wall and is a must-pass for tourists. It is reported that the highest price for a set of dishes is 3.5 million yuan, and the lowest is 1 million yuan. In addition, fresh and live large carp and large shrimp are more than 200,000 yuan. The next is Yingbin Building in the city. The store was particularly prosperous during the war. Unfortunately, the major shareholder is the well-known traitor Li Zongtang, and the court is still investigating. The most luxurious restaurant is the Taihu Restaurant in the Taishan Hotel, which offers both Chinese and Western dishes. Other restaurants such as Yingchunyuan, Wanli, Yanbinlou, and Yang Tianxing are slightly inferior to the above-mentioned restaurants in terms of the whole table, and the "snack bar" business is the most prosperous. Xifuli on Dashi Bridge is also often full of guests. (This Newspaper's Reporter Shi Wuwei)

### Most Educational Organizations in Shanghai Not Approved; Li Ximou Presents Report at Yesterday's Reception for Reporters

During the luncheon, Acting Director Li stated that the social and economic conditions are currently poor, and the number of out-of-school children is increasing daily. The Bureau of Education should take responsibility for resolving this issue. Regarding other issues related to education, he expressed the hope that all sectors would contact the Bureau at any time, and they would be willing to do their best to resolve them. As for needy students in primary and secondary schools in the city who require free admission, Li solemnly stated that he would be very willing to help verify and grant them free admission with the schools.

There are over 240,000 students in private primary schools, of whom 25% are on free admission. In total, the city has approximately 200,000 places for tuition-free students.

The initial site cleanup work after the explosion at the Jiangwan Ammunition Depot began on February 1st and has now been completed, costing 1.15 billion yuan.

The Bureau has divided the entire repair project into four phases: (1) The bombed-out east and west grandstands and bleachers, totaling 320 feet, started construction on February 26th and are scheduled to be completed on April 20th, with a repair cost of 11 billion yuan, contracted by Chengtai Construction Company.

Of the 20 billion yuan in repair funds, 5 billion yuan was allocated by the municipal government, 5 billion yuan was raised by Hao Gengsheng of the Ministry of Education, and 5 billion yuan was compensated by the United Aid Headquarters because the sports venue was heavily damaged during the ammunition depot explosion. The remaining 5 billion yuan came from the sale of salvaged old steel bars from the sports venue.

Part of the funds are being raised, and part is a loan, which will be repaid from ticket sales in the future.

When asked whether the establishment of the Sino-Australian Agreement and the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement could effectively prevent smuggling, Mr. Zhang said: After the establishment of the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement, smuggled goods from Hong Kong have been greatly reduced.

### Rice Prices Continue to Fall: Flour and Cooking Oil Rise

Yesterday, tight credit continued, and the rice market struggled to recover. Although the foreign exchange rate had been increased to 250,000 yuan, a rise of over 30%, the positive news did not stimulate sentiment. The price decline in the northern market was more severe than in the southern market, with a difference of 100,000 yuan between the two markets.

The total arrivals in the two markets were 8,417 shi.

Flour

In the early market, prices were unstable due to tight credit and were similar to the previous market. When news of the foreign exchange loosening spread to the market, more buyers appeared, and the northern merchants chose to bring in the old transport ship flour and the market improved. As a result, transport ship flour rose by 20,000 yuan, old army flour was 10,000 yuan higher, and other miscellaneous brands of flour were 10,000 to 20,000 yuan higher. Wheat bran rose by 10,000 yuan in the early market, and remained at 800,000 yuan in the later market.

Miscellaneous Grains

Declines outnumbered gains. Soybean oil factories bought slightly, white soybeans were flat, and vehicle soybeans rose by 50,000 yuan. Picked green soybeans rose by 20,000 yuan, and sandy red soybeans fell sharply by 200,000 yuan. Corn cargo owners were unwilling to sell cheaply due to the high cost of arrivals from the producing areas.

### National Cement Association: Urges Allocation of Foreign Exchange

[Our Newspaper News] The National Cement Association, in view of the increasing domestic cement production and the urgent need to expand foreign sales, yesterday submitted separate requests to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Export Management Committee, requesting that all foreign exchange earned from foreign sales be allocated to exporting manufacturers for the purchase of equipment and raw materials. The association also scheduled to appoint representatives this morning to visit Chairman Huo of the Export Management Committee and Director Chen Junren to personally present all the details.

The association's original report stated: The national cement production has now reached 115,900 metric tons per month, and will continue to increase sharply thereafter. However, domestic sales are currently sluggish, and the Southeast Asia, Philippines, Middle East, and Africa regions are eagerly awaiting our exports due to restrictions on British and American cement exports. The main bottleneck preventing foreign sales at present is the excessive difference in the current exchange rate. The foreign sales price, when converted to legal tender, is not even half of the cost. Therefore, it is hoped that all foreign exchange obtained from foreign sales can be allocated to exporting manufacturers for the purchase of equipment and the import of gypsum paper bags and other raw materials. In this way, the production needs of each factory can be fully supplied, and the manufacturing cost can be greatly reduced, thereby competing with other countries' products in the international market.

### Cotton Yarn Rebounds on Increased Buying: Off-Market Sentiment for Piece Goods is Buoyant

Yesterday's cotton yarn market initially saw weak sentiment, with prices hovering at low levels. Later, upon hearing that the foreign exchange rate had suddenly increased again by about 30%, and the previous day's decline was too large, buying interest slightly stirred. Merchants from Tianjin, Hankou, Guangdong, and other places started buying, and both industry insiders and outsiders came to buy as soon as they saw sellers. There was a clamor of buying in the market, and the market became more in demand than supply, with prices showing strength again.

Forty-two count Allied Phoenix fine yarn, initially priced at 160 million, rose steadily to close at 177 million yuan, a rebound of 19 million yuan compared to the previous day. Twenty-one count Shuangma single yarn, with strong short covering and the stabilizing forces taking the opportunity to push up prices, soared to a new high of 105 million yuan, a surge of 16 million. Present-day horse yarn also jumped 17 million to close at 108 million. In addition, 40-count and 32-count yarns all rose by 5-6 million to 10 million, and 20-count, 16-count, and 10-count coarse yarns all rebounded by about 10%.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market was flat at the opening, and with tight credit in the market, selling pressure was still high. Northern merchants and Shanxi merchants sold heavily, and prices generally declined. Nengtou fine cloth initially priced at 3.55 million yuan, fell straight to 510,000 with sellers, and then Hankou merchants took the opportunity to buy at low prices, and prices rebounded to 580,000. Later, at around 10 o'clock, there was a brief commotion due to the higher foreign exchange rate, but with credit still tight, industry insiders took advantage of the high prices to sell heavily, and scattered investors also competed to sell, and the market saw a decline again.

By noon closing, 12-pound Longtou fine cloth closed at a low price of 3.52 million, a further decline of 60,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, Yanghe, Caiqiu, Wufu, and other fine cloths also gradually declined by 40,000, 50,000, and 70,000 yuan. Pique, due to reduced sales, saw even more sellers, falling by about 100,000, while the rest of the cloth market trended stable.

It was also reported that after the close of the second cloth market, off-market news of the sharp rise in cotton banknotes and securities spread, and sentiment suddenly became buoyant. Buyers from all sides rushed to buy, with Longtou fine cloth gradually rising to 3.6 million yuan for spot goods, and 3.65 million yuan for tomorrow's delivery with eager buyers. Hankou merchants bought a lot of pique, and Four Gentlemen also rose to about 3.5 million.

In the foreword, it is stated: "The compiler, after studying the structure of modern Chinese characters, believes that all strokes can be classified into four categories. Therefore, this dictionary is compiled based on the principle of these four categories of strokes. First, the characters are classified according to the four categories of strokes, then divided into sections according to the four categories of strokes; then arranged in order according to the four categories of strokes; and finally, characters are searched according to the sequence of the four categories of strokes, hence the name 'Four-Four Dictionary'." These words explain the origin of its name.

In the compilation instructions, the opening sentence states: "The compilation of this dictionary is based on the following four objectives: First, the strokes of modern characters should be the standard for division. Second, the radicals should have a fixed position. Third, the number of radicals should be simplified. Fourth, the number of strokes for character searching should be simplified." Now, let's discuss these four points first.

Regarding the first point, the so-called "modern character form" does not refer to regular script, but rather to Song typeface. If Song typeface is considered a modern character form, then what is regular script? This statement seems to have a linguistic flaw and should be corrected first.

It is correct that the strokes of modern character forms (whether Song typeface or regular script) can be classified into four categories. The so-called four categories are dot (·), horizontal (一), vertical (｜), and left-falling stroke (丿). These are not Yao's inventions. According to the old indexing methods in our country, some people had already used "Jiang Shan Qian Gu" (江山千古, meaning —丿一) and "Yuan Heng Li Zhen" (元亨利貞, meaning 一｜丿一) and others. Among the new methods, taking "Han Lai Shu Wang" (寒來署往, meaning 丶一—丿) as the beginning as the scope of strokes is not uncommon.

In reality, the actual types of strokes are not just four: dot, horizontal, vertical, and left-falling stroke. Yao's method of classification follows the principle of considering variant forms, separated forms, and disregarding hooks. For example, ㇆ in 趣 is considered a variant of horizontal (一), and 捺 (㇏) is considered a variant of dot (·). Classifying 捺 into the dot category and ㇆ into the horizontal category adopts the first principle of classification. Also, in the character "一乃," which is usually written with three strokes, it is treated as 一 vertical, horizontal, vertical, left-falling stroke, adopting the second principle of classification. Hooks, such as the hook in the second stroke of characters like 丁, are not considered strokes, adopting the third principle of classification. Looking at the stroke classification table in this dictionary, it becomes clearer. However, classifying the short horizontal stroke in the second stroke of the characters "上" (up) and "止" (stop) into the dot category feels inconsistent with reality. Separating the joined stroke in "一灣" (a bay) is very consistent with scientific principles, but it is somewhat unaccustomed in practice. Yao states that "hooks are not considered strokes because they are irrelevant to indexing." If "干" (dry) and "于" (at/in/to) are encountered, they differ only by a hook. Is it truly irrelevant to indexing? If the principle of disregarding hooks is accepted, then vertical hooks and horizontal hooks should be treated equally. However, the horizontal hook in 一宀一 and the horizontal hook in "疋" are both classified as left-falling strokes. Isn't this self-contradictory? Therefore, the classification and selection of strokes are still open for discussion.

Regarding the second point, in the old radical system, the position of the radicals was not fixed, sometimes on the left, sometimes on the right, sometimes above, sometimes below, sometimes in the middle, sometimes on the outside, making it difficult to grasp and causing aversion, which was inevitable. Here, except for "乏" (lack), "冂" (enclosure), "鬥" (fight), "門" (gate), and "勹" (embrace) as exceptions, all use the three positions of "above," "left," and "upper left corner" as radicals. This kind of regulation is agreed upon by everyone.

However, specifying the position of radicals does not solve all problems within the radicals. Because radicals, in addition to their position in a character, also have characteristics of organization and structure. To clarify this issue, it is necessary to address the third point mentioned above. For the sake of convenience, it will be incorporated into the discussion in the next section.

Regarding the third point, the simplification of the number of radicals has reduced them from 214 to 90. What methods did Yao use to simplify them? It was simplified by adopting the methods of merging old radicals and adding new radicals. The so-called "adopting" refers to adopting old radicals, such as "氵" (water), "雨" (rain), "門" (gate), "竹" (bamboo), etc. The so-called "merging" refers to merging old radicals, for example, merging "立" (stand) into "亠" (lid), merging "走" (walk) into "土" (earth), merging "曰" (say) into "日" (sun), merging "月" (moon) into "月" (moon), etc. The so-called "adding new radicals" refers to the new additions of 一, "主" (master), "业" (industry), "×" (cross), etc. Statistically, out of the 90 radicals, 75 are old and 15 are new. From this perspective, this dictionary can be said to be a dictionary that improves the radical system.

One of the advantages of radicals is the clarity of their names and the clarity of their relationship with their radical tails. For example, it is universally known that the Li (李) character is separated into "木" (wood) and "子" (child), and the Chen (陳) character is separated into "阝" (mound) and "東" (east). The Kangxi Dictionary has 214 radicals, each with its own sound and meaning. But in this dictionary, many new radicals are named arbitrarily. For example, 一, 一丨, 一, "人" (person), "亻" (person), "鳥" (bird), 一, etc. are named arbitrarily, and the relationship between the radical and the radical tail in the characters contained in these radicals does not have a clear boundary. For example, we say "弓長" (bow long) is Zhang (張), which is very clear. But now the Zhang character is classified under the "㇟" radical. What are the remaining radical tail "張"?

Also, how many characters should a radical ideally contain? This cannot be determined by subjective preferences, but should be balanced by objective needs. Statistically speaking, these 90 radicals here contain a total of 9,690 characters, with an average of about 176 characters per radical. But the actual distribution is:

Number of Characters Number of Radicals

1-50 33

51-100 22

101-150 20

151-200 5

201-250 2

251-300 2

301-350 1

351-400 1

401-450 1

451-500 1

Among them, the smallest is the "鬥" (fight) radical, with only seven characters; the largest is the "氵" (water) radical, with 553. If seven characters can establish a radical, then why not establish radicals for those that contain more than seven characters and whose radicals and radical tails do have distinct forms, such as "方" (square), "豕" (pig), "卄" (twenty), "廴" (long stride), "虍" (tiger), "缶" (earthenware), "矢" (arrow), "角" (horn), "身" (body), "鬼" (ghost), etc.?

In addition, for entire characters that cannot be separated and whose strokes are intertwined or connected, such as the character "事" (matter), which used to be in the "亅" (hook) radical, is now in the "十" (ten) radical; the character "果" (fruit), which used to be in the "木" (wood) radical, is now in the "田" (field) radical; the character "年" (year), which used to be in the "千" (thousand) radical, is now in the "人" (person) radical; and "甘" (sweet), which used to be a radical, is now in the "卄" (twenty) radical. Comparatively, except for the improvement in the radical classification of the character "年" (year), isn't the rest just the pot calling the kettle black?

Regarding the fourth point of simplifying the strokes for character searching, Yao only divides them into dot, horizontal, vertical, and left-falling stroke and does not arrange the other strokes that are classified into these four categories in order, which is not strict enough. Furthermore, in the same category or the same radical, the order only considers the first four strokes and not the strokes after the fourth stroke, which feels too bound by the word "four." For example, in the dot category radicals, the "冫" (ice) radical is placed before the "㇟" radical, which is the former example. Also, the order of the seven radicals "門口足日目貝口" (gate mouth foot sun eye shell mouth) in the vertical category radicals only considers the first four strokes, resulting in a chaotic phenomenon, which is the latter example.

There is also one more point that needs to be mentioned, which is the issue of stroke order. According to ordinary rules, the principle is from top to bottom and from left to right. The character "竹" (bamboo) in this dictionary is classified under the "" radical. Then the stroke order of the character "竹" (bamboo) is 丿一丨一一, without any doubt. By analogy, the stroke order of the "竹" (bamboo) radical should of course be 丿一丨一. However, in the left-falling stroke category radicals, "竹" (bamboo) is placed after "人" (person). What is the reason for this? As for the example of using the principle of duplication when the first stroke of other characters has two branches, that is very correct. Yao said:

However, the quality of a dictionary is not determined solely by the convenience of searching. In addition, the richness of the vocabulary and the timeliness of the explanations must also be considered. Regarding the vocabulary of this dictionary, excluding the 37 characters that are used only as radicals, a total of 9,653 characters are recorded. Yao did not specify the basis for these characters, but judging from the use of telegrams, it is probably based on the telegram number book. Commonly used characters are likely included.

In conclusion, the strengths of this dictionary are that the vocabulary is fairly rich and the explanations are timely. However, in terms of indexing, it has not reached the level of "easy to search." It is hoped that Yao will make further corrections and improvements, and there may be a way out in the future.

### Western Trends

— Rong Juzhen

Recently, I saw an article in a magazine reviewing Mr. Jiang Menglin's recent book "Western Trends." The book was originally titled "Tides from the West" and published by Yale University. Here is an introduction to the main points of the review:

It is difficult to tell whether Dr. Jiang Menglin wrote this book with the attitude of an educator or that of a politician. This is an autobiography written in fluent and fresh English. He appropriately calls it "Western Trends." He was born in 1884 in a village not far from Ningbo, where transportation was convenient and there were many opportunities to come into contact with Shanghai, the cultural center of the West at that time. In his childhood, he saw houses destroyed by the Taiping Army, heard about the Wuxu Coup in Beijing, and heard the call for "new people."

At that time, the traditional lessons for scholars were the Four Books and Five Classics. Mr. Jiang also received this education. Later, he entered a new-style school, learned English, and accepted Western culture. He graduated from Columbia University in the United States and received a Ph.D. in philosophy. At that time, the heroes of China were Sun Yat-sen, Liang Qichao, and Cai Yuanpei. Mr. Jiang finally joined the Kuomintang and pledged allegiance to the party leader, President Chiang. The Chinese Communist Party considered him a reactionary, so he was very resentful of communism. He criticized the communist land reform policy, believing it was merely a deformed version of President Sun's Principle of People's Livelihood.

He spared no effort in attacking the Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai. He believed that Shanghai was extremely depraved, only cared about money, exploited and extorted, and was an abyss of sin. He compared Beijing and Shanghai. In Beijing, he served as the president of a national university for fifteen years. He believed that Beijing was the true paradise for artists, philosophers, and scholars. He described this world-famous ancient capital in great detail. Readers will surely find great pleasure in this chapter. This is Mr. Jiang's most proud place.

It seems inappropriate to criticize this book for those who do not fully understand the ideological revolution and social development of this extraordinary era. But we always want to see the truth of the Chinese situation at that time. This kind of demand will definitely be disappointed, because Jiang Guangzeng really wrote too briefly.

### An Overview of Xinjiang

— Zhenda

— Written by Su, Published by Independent Publishing House

The area of Xinjiang Province is 1,711,931 square kilometers, making it the largest province in the country, almost four times the size of Sichuan, sixteen times the size of Zhejiang, and fifty times the size of Taiwan. As for its population, according to the figures released by the Population Bureau of the Ministry of the Interior in July 1947, it is 4,012,330 people, accounting for only 0.7% of the national population. However, in fertile areas, the population density can reach more than 300 people per square kilometer. Since the resources of the entire province have not been fully developed, the future construction prospects of Xinjiang should not be ignored. However, construction must understand the geographical environment, otherwise it will be counterproductive and incompatible. Professor Ding Xiao's book "An Overview of Xinjiang" can be used as an excellent reference book. Therefore, despite my ignorance, I will introduce it.

This book is based on the author's travel and investigation in Xinjiang from May to October 1943. The journey covered both the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, passing through 42 counties. All important places in Xinjiang are included in the book, so the name "An Overview of Xinjiang" is fitting.

This book has a total of 94 pages divided into 12 chapters. The first chapter is on administrative divisions, describing the administrative regions of Dihua, Yili, Tacheng, Ashan, Hami, Yanqi, Kashgar, Aksu, Shache, and Hiemin separately.

The second chapter describes the area and population of Xinjiang. Xinjiang's area accounts for about one-seventh of the country's area, but its population is very small, with an average population density of only three people per square kilometer. However, in fertile arable areas, the density can reach 358 people per square kilometer. In terms of occupational distribution, farmers account for about 35% to 40%, and herders account for about 20%. The population distribution is denser in the south and sparser in the north.

The third chapter is on natural divisions. People usually divide Xinjiang's natural areas into Northern Xinjiang and Southern Xinjiang, but this division ignores the Tianshan Mountains, the Altai Mountains, and the Kunlun Mountains. The author divides Xinjiang's natural areas into six regions and twenty sub-regions based on topography and geological structure.

1. Northern Mountain Plateau Region - A. Altai Mountains B. Bulgen Plateau C. Buruzin Plain D. Tacheng Plateau.

2. Northern Xinjiang Basin - A. Suilai Basin B. Ebi Lake Plain.

3. Tianshan Mountain Region - A. Tianshan Mountains B. Yili Plain C. Zhenxi Basin D. Turpan Basin E. Baicheng Basin F. Ushi Plain.

4. Southern Xinjiang Basin - Tarim Basin.

5. Northern Mountain Region - A. Xingxingxia Plateau B. Bainendui Plateau C. Kuruktag D. Maqi Basin.

6. Kunlun Mountain Region - A. Kunlun Mountains B. Pamir Plateau C. Northern Tibetan Plateau.

The fourth chapter is on climate. Xinjiang is located in the Central Asian continent, with a continental climate. The north is slightly humid, while the southern desert is extremely dry. This chapter is further divided into sections on temperature, precipitation, humidity, cloud cover, wind and sand, and solar radiation.

The fifth chapter is on geology and minerals. The two basins of Xinjiang are ancient land. In the early Paleozoic era, the Tianshan, Altai, and Kunlun Mountains were all oceans. During the later Caledonian orogeny, the Altai Mountains rose in the north. At the end of the Paleozoic era, the Kunlun and Tianshan Mountains rose again. The Tianshan, Kunlun, and Altai Mountains were all formed by the influence of the orogenic movement and became compressed fault mountains. Later, due to the influence of the Himalayan movement, the entire Xinjiang Province became a basin shape, and the climate became dry due to the surrounding high mountains.

Xinjiang's minerals include iron, coal, and oil. At the end of this chapter, the author also discusses industrial construction, saying that Xinjiang's minerals are very dispersed. However, the area covered by Jinghe, Gongha, Yanqi, and Kuqa is relatively rich and concentrated in minerals. All iron, oil, zinc, lead, and other minerals have mining value. Although lacking coal, Gongha has 260,000 horsepower of hydropower, and Yanqi has 160,000 horsepower of hydropower that can be used. Moreover, the Yanqi and Gongha grasslands are vast, agriculture and animal husbandry are prosperous, and the three agricultural areas of Dihua, Yili, and Aksu are very close. Therefore, the future development of industry should belong to this area. These opinions can be used as a reference for the construction of Xinjiang.

The sixth chapter is on agriculture. Due to the climate in Xinjiang, the rainfall in Northern Xinjiang is slightly abundant, suitable for both farming and animal husbandry. However, the climate is cold and the growing season is short, so animal husbandry is more important than agriculture. The rainfall in Southern Xinjiang is scarce, but the climate is relatively mild and the growing season is longer. Agriculture is concentrated in fertile fields, using snowmelt for irrigation. The main crops are wheat, rice, corn, cotton, silk, and fruits.

The eighth chapter is on handicrafts, with Hotan as the main area. The main industries are silk weaving, Luopu carpets, jade, etc. The Yili area has the most modern industries.

Chapters nine to eleven are on residents, describing the evolution of residents, the Uyghurs, the Kyrgyz, and the Kazakhs separately.

The twelfth chapter discusses the possibility of immigration to Xinjiang. Xinjiang is vast and sparsely populated. Therefore, future construction lacks people, making construction difficult to promote. For the sake of construction, immigration is necessary. But what is the possibility of immigration? Based on water sources and farmland, the author estimates that 14 million people can be immigrated, and states that the construction of water conservancy and transportation is absolutely important in the future. This immigration issue is of great importance to the construction of Xinjiang and deserves our attention.

At the end of this book, there are three appendices: one is the Keru tribe, one is the three parts of the Kazakhs, and one is the railway plan. In the railway plan, the author plans to build three main lines - Lanzhou-Yining Line, Baotou-Hami Line, Lanzhou-Shufu Line, and thirteen branch lines - (1) Anxi-Ruoqiang Line, (2) Anxi-Korla Line, (3) Hami-Korla Line, (4) Dihua-Korla Line, (5) Dihua-Tacheng Line, (6) Dihua-Ashan Line, (7) Zhenxi-Hami Line, (8) Zhenxi-Dihua Line, (9) Korla-Shufu Line, (10) Aksu-Heqiao Line, (11) Korla-Ruoqiang Line, (12) Aksu-Yarkand Line, (13) Zhenxi-Ashan Line.

This book has 27 tables and two maps - an administrative regional map and a natural regional map. However, it seems that there are too few maps. Books on geography should emphasize both pictures and texts. Otherwise, too few maps can make readers feel inconvenient. It is hoped that the author can remedy this.

### Introducing Two Collections of Paintings

— Chen Congzhou

(The First Collection of Recent Works by Layman Daqian, Collection of Paintings by Xie Zhiliu, Glass Plate Edition, Sold by China Painting Garden on Chengdu Road)

Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, although the publishing industry has not recovered to the state before the war in terms of literary collections, the quality and quantity have reached a considerable level, and we cannot but congratulate the art world. However, what about painting collections? They are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. As far as I know, in the part of special collections, only three or five kinds were published last year. In addition to Zhang Daqian's Linfu Dunhuang First Collection, Wang Geyi's Collection, and Huang Junbi's Collection, there are only Zhang Shidaqian's Recent Works First Collection and Xie Zhiliu's Painting Collection, which have been published recently. Because the styles of the two are similar, I will introduce them together:

Zhang Daqian is known to the world for being able to imitate Shi Tao so realistically that he became famous at home and abroad. Since going to Dunhuang, he has gone from imitating the brushstrokes of the Yuan and Ming dynasties to regulating Song Dynasty painting and tracing back to the Six Dynasties. Several collections were published before the war, and the style was square and natural, different from today. The paintings he imitated were limited to figure paintings. Now this collection of twelve paintings includes landscapes, flowers and birds, figures, and walking animals. From the collection, we can see the path of research and the subject matter in painting in recent years. In addition to going to Dunhuang, he also recently examined the old collections of the Forbidden City, such as Bei Yuan's Xiao Xiang Map, Song Dynasty's Endless Rivers and Mountains Map, and Gu Hongzhong's Night Banquet Map. These famous works of the Tang and Song dynasties are all major ends in the records of ancient books. Not only are the original books unavailable, but now Zhang Shi's imitations have become the most truthful things in the world! In the collection, we can see such as Imitating Tang Painting Scattered Flowers, Bei Yuan Spring City叠嶂 (overlapping peaks), Han Gan Night Illumination White Picture, which are like facing the ancient books, and none of them is easily and hastily copied from. All the works have ancient people's brushstrokes and everywhere has a source. The printing is also very exquisite, and connoisseurs can use it for collection, and art school students can use it for copying. Although the true copy of Lanting is not visible, Chu Suiliang's silk copy is enough to be valued by the world!

Professor Zhiliu from Zhongda has deep attainments in Chinese painting, half of which is due to talent and half to academic strength. The Wang family of Wujin has always been famous for its literature. His brother Wang Cen's poetry and his sister Yue Mei's freehand flower and bird paintings are all known to the world. Therefore, only in such a good environment can such talents be produced. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he roamed the Northwest and went to Dunhuang with Zhang Shi to observe the murals of the Six Dynasties, Sui and Tang Dynasties. He returned to teach at the Imperial Academy of Bai Xia, and in art education, he did use the right track to enlighten future generations, without being affected by the pre- and post-Hai schools and Western paintings. He learned from the ancients. His flower and bird painting method is admired by people, and the fineness of outlining and coloring is rare today. The landscapes are majestic, quiet, and far-reaching, and the figures follow Lao Lian and enter the room of the Tang Dynasty. It is indeed rare to be a teacher with such skill. Unfortunately, he left Zhongda last autumn in response to Mr. Cheng Cangbo's invitation. This collection of books can be regarded as a souvenir for leaving Zhongda with his classmates! The collection includes twelve landscapes, figures, flowers and birds, all-encompassing. I love the Autumn Pond Picture, Red Tree Bamboo Birds, Moss Branches Adorned with Jade, and Pinggang Aishuang.

### Principles of Chemistry

— Wang Qiande

(Principles of Chemistry by J.H. Hildebrand, Translated and compiled by Cao Huiqun, One of the Yi You Academy Series, Published by Zhonghua Book Company)

China has always been a country with backward science, so there are very few works on science, and even translations are not very many. In this way, most of the science textbooks used by general high schools or above are original Western texts. As a result, Chinese young students suffer a lot and suffer a lot, because they have to spend half of their time studying linguistics, so the effect they get is certainly not 100%. Under such conditions, translated books are indeed closely related to the future of China.

Principles of Chemistry, except for some parts about naming that were adapted by the translator, the rest are taken from J.H. Hildbrand's Principles of Chemistry.

This book is divided into twenty chapters, and each chapter talks about different topics. In terms of content, there is no doubt that it focuses on theoretical things, and what is said are some of the most basic laws of general chemistry. These laws are also the most headache for students, but why do students have headaches? Although the law itself is a major reason, the writing style of the book author also has a considerable relationship.

Principles of Chemistry is completely different from ordinary chemistry books. For example, the third child talks about "Kinetic Theory of Gases". It not only explains all the general properties of gases clearly, but also uses diagrams to express many laws related to gases completely, and reveals them without leaving any trace, so that readers do not feel a bit of difficulty and dryness; such as Boyle's Law, there are two simple diagrams in this chapter to show the relationship between pressure and volume, because the entire Boyle's Law is just saying that "when the temperature is constant, the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure," that is (PV=p.v. or V=Con.tant). There are also other theoretical points such as "when the temperature is constant, the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its concentration", which is rarely found in ordinary chemistry books. What's better is to use the phenomenon of collision of various mixed gases with the wall to illustrate Dalton's Law of Partial pressure.

In Chapter 5, "The Relationship between Chemical Properties and Physical Properties and Atomic Structure", the reason why metals are easy to transmit electricity is explained by "because elements with few electrons in the outermost layer are extremely relaxed in absorbing electrons in the solid state", and the so-called transmitting electricity is the mutual transmission of electrons. Moreover, the three effects of the electric field on molecules are shown very clearly in a picture, plus some explanation, which is even clearer. In addition, the different properties of acids, salts, and hydroxides are explained by using the structure of atoms.

In Chapter 15, "Chlorination and Reduction", in order to make readers thoroughly understand the difference between reducing agents and oxidizing agents, many chemical reaction formulas are cited to illustrate this point. This spirit of not being afraid of trouble and thinking for the readers is the biggest feature of this book.

In addition, there are also many invaluable materials in "The Organization of Atoms", "Molecular Structure", "The Periodic System of Elements" and "Types of Equilibrium".

In short, if you are interested in chemistry, then you must read this book.

The above are all the advantages of this book, but unfortunately, Principles of Chemistry also has a small shortcoming, that is, the language used in the translation still contains some classical Chinese. Although classical Chinese sentences are relatively short, it is best to use vernacular Chinese for scientific translations. This is also a small criticism of Principles of Chemistry.

Finally, let me briefly introduce the history of Yi You Academy, because Principles of Chemistry is a member of the Yi You Academy series. Yi You Academy was established in the early 34th year of the Republic of China. It was organized by a group of famous scientists, because at that time they were unwilling to submit to the enemy and were unwilling to waste their precious time in vain. So they compiled and translated many famous Western scientific textbooks in order to lay the foundation for the revival of education in the future. Now the first collection is probably already complete. This collection has a total of more than ten volumes in three types: physics, chemistry, and mathematics. If you need to know more or more details, you can refer to Mr. Yuan Liang's "A Record of Cold-Weather Translation" published in the Dagong Daily on the 4th of this month.

### Reading "The Lily of the Valley"

— Lu Feiqiong

Authored by Balzac, translated by Gao Mingkai, published by Haiyan Bookstore

You asked me to write a book review for "The Lily of the Valley," and you also stipulated that "the form and content of a book review should be harmonious, just like creative writing." I can't do that. When I read a good book, I can't help but want to introduce it to others, but I often can't write anything. Although I think a lot, I write very little. Although I am fascinated by the author's wisdom, I can only repay it with a large, empty praise, such as "delicate," "profound," "beautifully worded," etc. Even at this moment, I dare not say that I am writing a book review; I just want to tell you softly, "I want to accuse Mrs. de Mortsauf!" Perhaps people will accept my accusation because I still deeply believe that the female gender can connect hearts and shorten the distance between people, don't you think?

From childhood, Balzac rarely received affection from others. His father and mother were always cold and stern towards him. Moreover, in appearance, he was not pleasing. His height and breadth, his lavish and repulsive clothes, and his rude and vulgar behavior at banquets were all unappealing. He was lonely, but he was unwilling to be alone. He held a lifelong desire—"to be loved."

The desire "to be loved" dominated his life. He needed a comforter, a guardian angel, a mother, a lover.

Thus, he found his ideal in Mrs. Berny.

Mrs. Berny was the first woman to truly recognize his genius, the first person to truly cultivate and encourage him. But when Balzac reached the pinnacle of the literary world, she was already a decrepit old woman. On her deathbed, she gave him a touching short letter: "I can die now. I can be sure that the crown I hoped you would wear is already on your head!" Balzac responded to the angel who had guarded him for fourteen years, "She was a solitary flower that the world did not notice. She was once my guiding star."

This solitary flower is "The Lily of the Valley."

When Mrs. de Mortsauf was withered and confined to her valley mansion, managing her children and her mentally ill husband, she suddenly received an unexpected ray of light, which was her reception of a child, a seventeen-year-old boy who gravitated towards her out of a need for maternal love. At the same time, for similar reasons, she accepted the outstretched hand.

"Only a woman's final love can satisfy a man's initial love." The depth of this kind of love is unfathomable. "This woman will never think of herself, only of you. She will not argue with you. She will not ask about her own interests. She will perceive dangers for you that you yourself do not see, yet she will forget her own dangers. Finally, if she suffers, she will not complain. She will not flatter you in the slightest, but she will have a respectful attitude towards what you love in her." (Balzac's words)

An understanding of the world and a mature state of mind made Mrs. de Mortsauf's love increasingly "divine." The love of young women is selfish. They only love themselves (even their own fantasies). They want you to dedicate your entire life to them. They want to possess you, follow you, as if you were their own shadow. However, the love of a middle-aged woman is unconditional. They only ask for a moment of your time, a word, a glance, a tone, a seemingly minor act of attention. They do not want to possess you physically; they only wish to slumber deep within your soul.

"To be loved and understood is the greatest happiness." Unfortunately, this happiness is not lasting. When youth grows wings, it flies away, tempted by another kind of caress. Thus, this solitary lily begins to wither in "excessive affection."

A woman who is accustomed to suppressing emotions must find it easier to overcome pain than to serve virtue. She can hold her head high in great suffering, but she cannot allow love to bow before law and virtue. Mrs. de Mortsauf was the same. She was a mother and the legal wife of Count de Mortsauf. For moral reasons, she had an obligation to remain chaste. She had to swallow her own pain and be a "good wife and mother." However, "thoughts cannot be controlled," and the thirst for love burned her body and mind. When she was dying, she regretted it: "One should live in truth, not in deception. My whole life has been a deception. In these past few days, I have counted the number of these deceptions. I, who have never truly lived, I, who have never gone to the wilderness to find someone, can I die like this?"

"Can I die like this?" Alas, this wild lily in the valley, her life's fate was restricted by the "heavy chains" placed on women by gold rings.

Growing quietly, silently budding in the valley, spending her abundant youth in loneliness, she had a brilliant summer. However, because she still longed for the desolation of the valley in the past, she dared not wantonly accept passionate caresses in the sunlight. She preferred to be a twinkling rooftop star in the evening. No one knew her, no one fully understood the greatness of this woman's life, and no one dared to traverse the entire realm of her soul.

Before all those who "bury orchids and irrigate roses," I want to accuse on behalf of Mrs. de Mortsauf.

### Great Emptiness

— Bai Yong

Mr. _____'s continuous long novel "Mr. Mosuyou After Taking an Airplane" published in a literary magazine is an autobiography of his life during the Anti-Japanese War. Because his articles have always been known for their obscurity, and recently they are full of Buddhist overtones, they are naturally not favored by the general youth of today. Therefore, I am afraid that not many people will read this text. In fact, the style of this novel is very different from the previous ones. Difficult-to-understand artistic conceptions and sentences like "Date," "Bridge," and "The Biography of Mr. Mosuyou" are rarely seen. On the one hand, it may be a change in the author's own style, and on the other hand, it is also because the life the author describes is all about teaching elementary or middle school days, and there is no way to be profound.

What attracts our attention most here is his view on Chinese literature and writing attitudes and techniques. The author has always belonged to the "expressing aspirations" camp, advocating self-expression and not falling into the empty shouts of formalism. This article seems to continue this attitude. For example:

"...Whether it is Shakespeare in England or Yu Zishan in China, the poet himself is like spring or autumn, so the world is the subject matter, like all kinds of flowers and trees, they bloom when they meet spring, the so-called myriad purples and reds are always spring, or one leaf falls and the world knows autumn. When I read Shakespeare and Yu Zishan, I only recognize one poet, who expresses himself everywhere. However, Shakespeare expresses himself through stories and characters, and Chinese poets express themselves through diction and allusions. One expresses himself in life, and the other expresses himself in artistic conception..."

If you hold this attitude to measure works, naturally there will be many mistakes. For example, Han Yu's articles are chanted three times in ancient prose, but the author criticizes his "Sending Dong Shaonan to Travel in Hebei Preface" as empty, without emotion, without meaning, that is, without any material. Wang Anshi's "Reading the Biography of Lord Mengchang" is also like this. Moreover, aren't the scholars raised by ancient princes just crowing chickens and stealing dogs? Why say such nonsensical words as "The reason why crowing chickens and stealing dogs come out of his door is that scholars do not come?" Originally, this is the old tune of the school of expressing aspirations, but if you think about the past discussions of Chinese literati, they are probably like this, sitting at home and talking nonsense about world affairs, right or wrong is completely irrelevant. Or they specialize in saying nonsense, such as gift prefaces or epitaphs, which are not only flattering, but also simply scribbling on paper. It's just that this Qiu Ju's "Sending Dong Shaonan Preface" is not very appropriate. The emptiness and emptiness of Han's articles are definitely not this one. If you talk about the popular gift prefaces, I think articles such as "Sending Gao Xian, a Buddhist Monk Preface" are much more empty than this one. Since the Anshi Rebellion in the Tang Dynasty, the towns in Hebei have superficially surrendered to the central government, but in fact they are independent, and it can be said that An Lushan's system has always existed. Therefore, Han satirizes Dong Jun because he cannot forget those who are there, and "depressedly suitable for this land," that is, the meaning of "Zhi Hu Zhi Yue," which is quite implicit, how can it be said that it is meaningless? (In recent years, Chen Yinque discussed the political situation in the middle and late Tang Dynasty, and also cited this as evidence.) As for Han's "flattering tomb articles," which have been criticized since ancient times, that is really a representative of emptiness. What should be paid attention to here is that, whether it is empty or true, the big problem of Chinese literati is that they try their best to demand "greatness in writing," not only are they unwilling to do small topics, but even if they are small, they have to "make a big fuss about a small thing" to be considered the essence of writing. The so-called greatness is nothing more than the society, rulers, and kings, forcibly pulling and dragging. Put your own hat on someone else's head, for example, things that violate human relationships, such as "Wu Zixu is not a loyal minister, and filial son is not a filial son," and formulaic words such as "One mountain is watched, and its tightness is greater than the rise and fall of the country," are enough to make people headache or nauseous. It seems that one must fill one's mind with these problems all day long, as for food, drink, men and women, sleeping and getting married, which are inseparable from human beings every day, but no one talks about them, even if they read them, they will definitely be scolded by others, such as Li Liweng and Jin Shengtan. Of course, we don't have to advocate that everyone write Yuan Zhonglang's essays, but there is no need to recite the original Tao every day, which is very obvious. The popularity of this tradition has not been cut off until now. If we look at today's students' essays, eighty or ninety percent of them are "Time passes so quickly, spring has come to the world again," "How can China be strong like this," etc. This is a continuation of the "Between heaven and earth," which Wu Shichang scolded in his observations last year, but the reason why it cannot be improved is still due to what is heard and seen, all are rushing to the west, or are full of certain tones. So that young people lose the courage and motivation to express themselves. They have never thought about how to say what they want to say, but no matter what the topic is, there is already a formula waiting in front, no matter how similar they are, even if they do it year after year and day after day, they are all the same. Fei Ming called this the spirit of Bagu in his article. He once gave the students the title "Maple Tree," and all his life he wrote "There are two trees in front of my window, one is a maple tree, and the other is also a maple tree." At first glance, I thought this student was extraordinary, but later I saw another student, whose beginning was the same, and so on until the third and fourth, all were the same, and then I suddenly realized that they had learned from Fa Xunqiu Night; "There are two trees in my backyard, one is a date tree, and the other is also a date tree." He was immediately so angry that his face turned red, and he scolded the students: "Why don't you say your own words, but copy other people's?" This is probably the experience that any Chinese teacher in secondary schools has had. In fact, it is good to be able to imitate this kind of sentence making, most of them still can't do it. All they know is a set of empty and empty traditions, no matter what topic you give, they will put it on, every head seems to have no shadow of life experience - even if it is very simple - what they say on paper is completely different from what they really want to say. Suppose the new literature continues like this, even if there are one or two famous writers and dozens of famous works, what's the use?

Great emptiness, no truth can fill it!

### The Greatness of the World

— Le

After an unknown amount of lip service, the US Senate finally passed the amount needed for the first year of the European aid plan, totaling $5.3 billion. However, the total amount of alcohol taxes (including central and local taxes) collected by the US government in 1947 alone exceeded $4 billion. In other words, the average American family paid $115 in alcohol taxes last year.

In the 159-year history of the United States, a total of 27 special congressional sessions have been convened, averaging one every six years.

### Miscellaneous Discussions of Right and Wrong

— Nian Hong

A person must have a belief that there must be truth in the world. It is easy to fill the sea, but to bury the truth is a difficult thing that can never be found in history. No matter what "This is right and wrong, that is also right and wrong," "Right and wrong are relative," "There is no right and no wrong" this set of mysterious "philosophy," it can never deny the existence of right and wrong.

Anyone who does anything should do it for the sake of seeking truth. What is right is right, and what is wrong is wrong. There is absolutely no reason for being both right and wrong. Confucius said that it is okay to die in the evening after hearing the Tao in the morning, which means that after understanding right and wrong, even if you sacrifice for the sake of seeking truth, there is nothing to fear. This kind of clear observation and speech, even if there are thousands of years apart, its value remains unchanged because the meaning it contains is precisely the truth. On the contrary, things or words that generally intend to confuse right and wrong and invert black and white, even if they are heard for a while, will soon disappear without a trace.

It is not enough to understand right and wrong, you should go to the right and save the right, dare to fight with "wrong," so that the light of "right" is not obscured by the cloudy fog, passively removing the bad is equal to actively building the good, "Destruction is construction." Mr. Sun Yat-sen said this. Because if the old is not removed, the new cannot be built, and if the "wrong" is not removed, the "right" will also be obscured by it. For example, if a person has the bad habit of wasting money, if he does not remove this bad habit, he will only try to let him earn more money, but even if he earns a lot of money, there is no limit to waste, this person will never be able to accumulate a small amount of money, only by correcting the bad habit of waste can we talk about increasing production.

I think that the reason why this world is so indifferent is perhaps because of the lack of enthusiasm for loving what is right and hating what is wrong. People should have something to love and something to hate. If there is no hate, there is no use for love. The more a great person has the spirit of loving people, the more he hates the few who do evil. Chinese people unfortunately have been poisoned by "Right and wrong are only for opening their mouths," and they lack the courage to be right and wrong, so especially in China, right and wrong are almost difficult to identify, and therefore some people doubt the existence of right and wrong.

There is absolutely no so-called superman among human beings, so it is impossible for one person's words and deeds to be all right, and another person's words and deeds to be all wrong, but this does not mean that there is no right and wrong in the world. The existence of right and wrong is for things, not for people. Often what is right for you is wrong for me, and what is right for me is wrong for you. If people can not think that they are all truth, treat each other frankly, and complement each other's shortcomings, the truth will not be difficult to be clear. If you avoid medical treatment and are afraid of people criticizing your mistakes, it violates the truth, and you are willing to do evil without hesitation.

### Liang Rengong's First Visit to Kang Nanhai

— Wei Zhi

Liang Rengong was active in the Chinese literary world for a full 30 years, greatly influencing later generations. Mr. Zheng Zhenduo has repeatedly praised him in "Collected Essays on Chinese Literature." As a prose writer, he swept away the so-called lifeless and lifeless prose at that time; as a politician, after the political change of 1898, he also created a trend, leading a large group of people to follow the same path; as a journalist, he was a very successful commentator and writer, and his academic achievements were not in having profound research, but in popularizing his knowledge and showing it to the public.

Rengong's knowledge was undoubtedly greatly influenced by Kang Youwei (Nanhai) at first. Although since the Xinhai Revolution, the paths of the two have been quite different, in the beginning, Rengong benefited a lot from Nanhai, and Nanhai was no different from his mentor. In Rengong's "Autobiography at Thirty," there is a passage mentioning the situation when he first visited Nanhai, which is very moving, and from this, we can also imagine Nanhai's influence on Rengong, which is extremely profound and great.

Rengong's original text is as follows:

"...Therefore, I followed Tongfu (Chen Qianqiu) to observe the etiquette of a disciple and served Mr. Nanhai. At that time, I was young and had a successful career, and I was quite knowledgeable about the phonology and etymology that were valued by the current trends, and I was often complacent and happy. Mr. then made a lion's roar with the sound of the ocean tide, taking the useless old learning that he had held for hundreds of years, and refuting and refuting it, completely overthrowing and clearing it. I entered to see him at Chen Shi and retired at Xu Shi. Cold water was poured on my back, and I was hit on the head. Once I lost all my old fortresses, I was at a loss and didn't know what to do. I was both surprised and happy, both complaining and regretting, both suspicious and fearful. I lay on the same bed with Tongfu and couldn't sleep all night. The next day I visited again and asked for learning guidelines. Mr. then taught me the Lu-Wang school of mind and also the outlines of history and Western studies. From then on, I resolutely gave up the old learning, withdrew from the Xuehai Hall, and asked Nanhai for advice every other day. I knew that I had learned from this moment."

This passage is written very vividly and sincerely, with overflowing emotions, and it is also a typical chapter of Rengong's memoirs.

### The Enormous Capacity of a Drunkard

— Wang Baili

I say that drunkards have different spleens and stomachs. Those who are good at drinking enjoy it endlessly, and those who cannot drink will turn red in the face and pant even if they only drink a drop. I drink wine like medicine. Whenever I have social gatherings with friends, I am often ashamed. Therefore, when I see someone who is good at drinking, I am always envious in my heart.

Before the war, there was a new shop next to the Great World, which was promoted by a beer-drinking competition. At that time, there was a person who drank twenty-four bottles without getting drunk, but his stomach was so full that he could not drink anymore. Although it was beer, the amount was also visible. I heard my late father say that a certain person in the county (the name has been forgotten) was good at drinking. He always ate and drank wine and sweat (the most violent in Wenzhou wine, boiling yellow wine in a pot to take its steam, the steam is like sweat, so it is named). It doesn't matter how much he drinks, he doesn't care. If he is invited to drink by a friend, he must first cook half a bowl of alcohol and drink it hot, and then go. Generally, yellow wine is used in banquets. Even if yellow wine is drunk frequently throughout the banquet, he can't get drunk. The size of his alcohol capacity can be known. I once met Zhu Jiuxian in Ningbo. Zhu can usually drink seven or eight catties. If he plays guessing games, he can drink more than ten catties. Zhu is good at hand-to-hand combat, so he is rampant in Ningbo and is known as invincible. Anyone who can drink in Yongshang knows it. However, compared to those who could drink in ancient times, it is still far from enough. Ruan Wushan's Tea Yu Kehua records: "Among the drinkers in Jiangzuo, Gu Xiajun (Sil) is the first. He lives in Xiuye Garden and forms a community. There are three wine vessels in his house. The larger one can hold thirty catties. They kill each other in turn. All those who enter the community must first finish three vessels before taking their seats. Therefore, the door is signed: 'Wine guests pass the door, invite them in and give them three elegant drinks. See each other in the morning and decide the winner. Those who are not, do not associate with each other.' The drinkers were frightened and left when they saw it. Occasionally there were those who mustered up the courage, but after three elegant drinks, they could do nothing. When he was in the capital, he gathered drinkers at the same time and competed in groups, and he was also invincible. At that time, Fang Jinwen (Qin), Zhuang Shutian (Kai), Miao Xiangzhi (Yuan), and Li Ningxian (Zhiyuan) were all enemies of thousands of people." If this is the case, then the words in the Biography of Chunyu Kun, a jester, are not entirely unfounded.

### Books

— Jin Lin

Except for a living person, there is nothing more amazing than books, because the knowledge we get from books may be obtained from people thousands of miles away or people who have been dead for many years, and a thin piece of paper can talk to us, excite us, educate us, comfort us, and talk to us as frankly as a brother. -- Kingsley

The books that can help us the most are those that can make us think the most. A book written by a great thinker is full of truth and beauty. - Sivatu Parker

The place where I put my best companion - books - I regard it as a shining palace. -- Flilique

### From Hangzhou to She County

— Shi Shufan

What is the name of Wan Cunhe? The angry hair hangs alone, and the meaning turns flat. It is better than the lake and mountains, which are not my home. The road is not dry, carrying the spring to travel. Leaving home, the moon rises, worrying about danger and heaviness. In the wild, the wind rises, and the beans and wheat are clear. Corrupt and shallow thoughts are always for the world. It is not because of being awake or drunk that the eyes are especially bright.

The waist and shoulders are strong and thin, and the ink is thick and fat. I once forgot about food and clothing because of the changes in the world. Saying goodbye to the weeping willows, which are five feet in circumference. I can't bear to sigh that life is not the same for ten years! The lamp is bright and the village wine knows the cold and warmth. The stone is wrinkled and the Wan Mountain distinguishes the details. It is strange that the original essence cannot be hidden. The car leaps forward, and the trees can fly.

Staying in Yuqian

The feeling of loss in the streets and buildings, carrying the wind hat, the night is dusty. Rui frost lightly beats the West Bodhi Temple, and the yellow moon is as quiet as a drunken person.

Out of Yuling Pass

I allow myself to store sorrows, full of burdens and deep, and the hot air of sweat comes out of the pine forest. How does the sentry tower plan to reduce the king's tax? The slanting sun is red and connected to the burden.

The setting sun flies sand on the roadside, and the crows settle down, how busy the trees are! Ask who's heart is more chaotic than the spring mountains? Silently layer by layer, but blindly blue.

### Two Modern Composers of Melodies

— Old Man Half-Dream

Poems of the Tang, lyrics of the Song, and melodies of the Yuan are era-defining literary products. When it comes to literature and art, they are not inherently divided by eras. So why are eras delineated? It is because during those times, numerous talented individuals emerged, delving deeply into these fields. Everyone placed great importance on these areas, and their works became popular for a time, widely circulated, and became major authoritative works that continue to be recited even after thousands of years. Moreover, even though these are just brief passages of words, they can not only express the worldview of that time but also subtly reveal the state of society and the current situation of the country. Often, what history cannot record, they can record with "songs of lament" and "melodic chants" in a roundabout way. Bai Xiangshan's "Song of Everlasting Regret" from the Tang Dynasty is one example.

However, after the Yuan Dynasty, during the Ming and Qing dynasties, there were no more so-called representative literary works, because their literature and art came from the three dynasties of Tang, Song, and Yuan. Although there were many poets, most of the highest achievements could be traced back to the High Tang, such as Li Kongtong and He Dafu of the Ming Dynasty, and Wang Yuyang and Wu Meicun of the Qing Dynasty. There were very few lyricists that could be mentioned, and even fewer musical compositions. For example, Gao Ming's *Pipa* and Tang Xianzu's *Peony Pavilion* can be considered outstanding works of their time. During the late Qing Dynasty, there were many talented composers, and besides You Hui'an's *Lisao*, Hong Biancun's *The Palace of Eternal Life* was the most famous. At that time, there was a saying: "Pity one melody of *The Palace of Eternal Life*, ruining one's career until old age."

After the reform, although several musical scores were published, such as *Cang Sang Yan*, there were still not many who continued to compose. In my humble opinion, there are a few Sanqu (a type of Chinese song) that are worth reciting. During the Republic of China's sixteenth year (1927), when Yang Yunshi was popular, he wrote "Such a Distant Land", subtitled "A journey ten years later, a farewell ten years ago." Now I will write his lyrics below:

(Lonely Ancient Road in the Setting Sun) A bag of books is packed and carried on a pole. I remember the year he saw me off at the long pavilion, and we held hands to disperse the loneliness on the Wanli Bridge. Bitter farewell, thousands of golden willow branches in the cold, a gust of west wind blows fallen leaves against the battle robe. Saying goodbye, the cartwheels shake, the horsewhips crack, and at that moment, the soul is shocked into the clouds. (One) Wildflowers along the way are like faces, distant mountains are like eyebrows, you can't help but shed tears. In between, countless thoughts churn in the gut, endless drafts of sadness. Turning around suddenly, the journey is ten miles away, unable to see the figure waving goodbye by the willows, only seeing the cold stream and small solitary city. (Two) Crossing the river bridge, staying overnight in a desolate village, last night it was the voices of people in a high building and the laughter of red lanterns, tonight it is a wild inn, mountain passes, stars and moon high. Not knowing the hardships of saddles and horses, only the sorrow of separation stabs the heart like scissors, alas! This taste of sorrow cannot be dispelled. Bring a pot of turbid wine, and slowly drench the intestines. (Three) Asking the hundred-foot Yuntai pavilion, how many of you still have youthful faces? Regretting back then throwing down the pen to join the army, full of heroic spirit, saying that military service and books will bring good achievements, never seeing a young woman in her boudoir whose husband has been ennobled, only seeing the bones of war high on the banks of the Wuding River. Now, the iron halberd sinks in the sand and the achievements are gone, only winning the abandonment of a fragrant quilt and an aging person, moreover, the deep jade bones are buried under flowers and grass, already a secluded tomb, the soul returns at dusk, how can this long-lasting hatred be endured! (Four) Originally surrounded by brocade, flowers, seclusion, pearls and emeralds, I abandoned the tender land and comfortable nest, and exchanged it for this broken land, the backs of horses and the bows of boats. Saying what is the quiet poetic sentiment of the dawn wind and the waning moon, it is nothing more than ancient ramparts, cold clouds, and withered vegetation. Asking how much is an inch of good time worth? For whom is it wasted, not worth half a cent! Regretting the initial ambition and heroic spirit, mistakenly entered the Handan Temple, this betraying others and oneself, this life and death separation is endless, who knows of the tears on the pillow soaking the silk handkerchief! (Five) All year round, it's a difficult time. Managing things alone, no one to see me off on the journey, feeling lonely and desolate, no one to talk to, for a long time not hearing words of concern about food and clothing, who asks if I am cold, warm, hungry, or full. In the past, my spirit was as good as Zhang Xu under the willow breeze, but now I have wasted myself and become as thin as Pan An. (Six) What is most unbearable is the wind and frost all the way, the water villages and mountain shops close early, the quilt still has lingering fragrance, helplessly slightly drunk and idly sleeping, haphazardly falling asleep in clothes, sighing long and short, gritting my teeth and enduring this remaining night. The heartbroken man has never slept soundly night after night, only opening his eyes to dawn every day. Alas! It's reached the thousands of mountains, the setting sun, and the rooster's crowing. (Seven)

His tone of "deep and unending affection" is enough to make those who appreciate it feel their spirits soar. There is also Chen Diexian from Hangzhou, nicknamed "Natural Student," who, when he encountered the war with Japan, fled from Hangzhou to Yunnan and wrote a *Meng Jiangnan* melody. I will also write down his lyrics:

(New Water Order) Flying over the mountains of Sichuan, I come to be a hermit in the south, fleeing the three caves of Qin, baggage all discarded, what is the reason, crossing the world still walking in circles. (Lazy Ditty) Recalling the building by the West Lake, the wind curtain is rolled up every day, the two peaks of the distant hills always contain shyness, the hidden smiles are behind the screen, the mirrored silk reflects the light of the waves, like jade. (Mountain Slope Sheep) Only being happily drunk with wine on the Six Bridges, drunkenly seeking seclusion in the Three Temples, gently rowing in the middle of the lake, loving the moonlight of the tranquil lake as if it were always a painting, spring returns to autumn, the planet Jupiter cycles three to five times, planting willows in front of the door, greening the window of the building. All are old houses, Qingzhao's dressing room, leisurely, all day long with poems and wine, tender, everywhere are flowers and willows. (Wild Goose Falling and Winning Song) Who would have thought last autumn, that the flames of war would suddenly fade, the air raid sirens would roar like cattle, suddenly the spirit chariot flies, ah, how many phoenixes and luan couples are there in this chaotic separation, all becoming laboring swallows flying away. Unexpectedly, Heaven protects us, our family, scattered everywhere, gather in the south behind the screen, retire, preparing for a boat on the Five Lakes, lingering, treating Hangzhou as Bianzhou. (Lucky Order) The whole family bravely dies for the country, the whole house is without sorrow, instead the lake village has an additional air-raid shelter, reviewing the pavilion and lying down together on the mound. (Selling Wine and Praising Peace) Who is worried about the sky falling? Who is worried about the sky falling? In a hurry, urging people to leave, changing the stars and shifting the grains, planning for oneself. Seeing that it is quiet, the fleeting clouds quickly emerge from the cave, the flowing water is divided in confusion, the dog from Huainan ascends to heaven, the monkeys from Huaguoshan are sent away, I, ah, like someone borrowing, leaving alone, ah, fearing that the puppet strings will not last long. (Spoke of Sichuan) Seeing through the barrier of life and death, the dissected Buddha can be endured. Let them go, why not I stubbornly defend, moreover, the peach blossom spring tomb has already been built. (Mandarin Duck Ending) Who knows that after the water runs out and the mountains are exhausted, a thunderous chariot unexpectedly waits at the door, as if waking from a dream, entering meditation, reincarnation, just counting on the remaining years, enjoying the late scenery, acting naturally. In the past six months, turning back to my hometown, fortune and misfortune come from seeking, let the magnificent building become a barren mound, I had already said that the four elements are empty and nothing remains.

The works of both of them contain a kind of true emotion, excellent tone, and beautiful structure, and they can indeed follow in the footsteps of the Yuan people. It is a pity that not much has been passed down, and they have not yet been able to satisfy the appreciation of those who came later. I remember thirty years ago, I once proofread and printed a collection of musical scores for the owner of Songfen Hall, which was a collection from Qian Mutang's library, and there was a new tune of Shuangtiao Water Order: "For twenty years, I have seen through the barrier of life and death, I have been removed from the register of the Black Court, the ghost gods call the Dragon to return to the Lu Sea, riding the tiger down the green mountain, jumping out of the mortal world, from now on there will be no more loyalty." There was also a Resident Horse Listening tune that said: "Thousand-year-old face, jade liquid, yellow bud, nine-turn elixir, half a lifetime of illusion, wind lamp, flint, ten thousand-fold beach, the door of right and wrong is as wide as the sea, the battlefield of fame and gain is as dangerous as a mountain range, from now on, don't interfere, often deep at midnight, facing the Dipper stars, shifting incense burner." It is truly singing into the clouds, and can be called the most perfect tune. I hope that composers will study it in depth, create more excellent musical scores, and not let the Yuan people monopolize the glory of unprecedented achievement.

### The Carefree Flower

— Chen Shengyan

Chapter Twelve: Chance Encounter Marriage (101)

Although Qiwan was not happy in her heart, she hid it for a while and did not say it. Because since she had arrived in Shanghai, she had to go to see her mother, so she invited Daoyun to go with her. Daoyun, however, declined, saying that he was busy with things and needed to arrange everything before he could go and pay his respects to his mother-in-law. Qiwan saw that what he said was beyond reason, and she wanted to refute him and pull him along. Later, she thought that it would be better for her to go and pay her respects to her mother first and explain the situation, so as to avoid the matter coming suddenly and startling the old woman. So, while Daoyun was out, she hired a car and rushed to Mingde Lane. Her mother, Gu Liuru, was overjoyed to see Qiwan suddenly come to Shanghai, as if a bright moon had fallen from the sky into her arms. She held Qiwan and asked about everything, saying, "Seeing the newspaper reports about your suicide by poison, I was very worried. I wrote you two letters, but there was no reply. I wrote to your brother, but there was no reply either. Later, a friend told me that these were all rumors. I also thought that if there was really bad news, there would definitely be a letter from home. Today you came, and I am really happy beyond words." Qiwan heard this and knew that the news of her suicide by poison had already spread to Shanghai. The news had traveled really fast. So she briefly recounted the past events. Liuru was shocked to hear that Qiwan and Daoyun had married and asked, "How did you marry Daoyun? I know this person." Qiwan said, "He also said that he knew my mother. I thought he had considerable property, and he was gentle and amiable, and all his temperaments were very compatible." Liuru shook her head and said, "This person looks good on the outside, and all his social interactions are also very good, but his temperament is unreliable. As for saying that he has considerable property, I have never heard of it. You have handled this matter too rashly." Qiwan was stunned when she heard this. Liuru said, "Although I say this, things have already come to this point, so you don't have to regret it. He says that he has property in Shanghai and Hong Kong, which cannot be concealed. As long as we investigate, we will know. Moreover, you can try to gauge him in various ways." Qiwan said, "As soon as he arrived in Shanghai, he had me stay at the Middle East Hotel, which made me suspicious. He has a home in Shanghai, why doesn't he go home directly? Even if he has to stay at a hotel, he should stay at a decent, big hotel. Just this point alone makes me very unhappy." Liuru said, "You can invite him to come tomorrow. He said that he is looking for actors and producers, etc. As long as I talk to him, I will know his true character. You don't need to be anxious. Fortunately, you have already come to Shanghai. I am here, and I have my own ways." Saying this, she comforted her again, kept Qiwan for dinner, and then told her to go back.

### List of Approved Recipients of the China Report Readers' Scholarship (1)

The application forms for the Spring Semester of the 37th Year (1948) "Readers' Scholarship," organized by this newspaper for universities, colleges, high schools, and junior high schools, have already been preliminarily reviewed by the scholarship committee of this newspaper. They were then submitted to the Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee for a second review. The university and college group was sent back yesterday, with a total of eighty-four qualified applicants. There were thirty-eight applicants who failed to pass due to duplicate applications or other reasons. This newspaper immediately issued scholarship checks and sent approval notices to various schools, hoping that the students who received the aid would stamp them with the original seal and present the notices to the hall to receive the scholarship. As for the students applying from junior and senior high schools, they are still under review by the Unified Review Committee, and the results should be announced next week. The list of approved recipients from the university group is published as follows:
