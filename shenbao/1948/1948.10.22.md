### Northeastern Strategic Showdown Begins: National Army Advances According to Plan; Bandits Concentrate Five Columns to Attack Jinxi

[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 21st] The National Army and the bandits in the Northeast have begun a strategic showdown, with the National Army advancing according to plan. The bandits have also decided to continue attacking and harassing Jinxi and Huludao. The National Army's westward advance contingent from Shenyang is pressing toward Heishan and Fuxin from Xinlidan. The southward contingent appears to be taking action again, with battles expected in Haicheng and Yingkou, which may soon fall into the National Army's grasp. As for the bandit attacks and harassment against Jinxi, it has been demonstrated that a portion of the bandit's 11th Column began attacking National Army strongholds in the northwest of Jinxi on the evening of the 19th. The bandit 4th Column launched a counterattack from Tashan against the National Army attacking Tashan, with extremely fierce fighting. Furthermore, the bandit 3rd Column, after fleeing from Jinzhou, has moved to the area west of Tashan, and the 7th Column is also at Tashan. Additionally, the 9th Column has detoured west to the area around the Da Xiao Ying River mouth north of Xingcheng. Currently, east of Jinxi, there are parts of the bandit 3rd, 4th, 7th, and 11th Columns, while west of Jinxi, the 9th Column has moved from Jinzhou. The bandits have concentrated five columns of troops around Jinxi, demonstrating considerable ambition. Jinxi is defended by newly arrived elite National Army troops, who will engage in a tough battle with the bandits, which may become the decisive battleground. The sound of gunfire is becoming increasingly intense, and the air force is constantly flying over to conduct reconnaissance and bombing. The scale of the battle will surpass that of Jinzhou.

### Zheng Dongguo Cables President, Resolves to Preserve National Integrity

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 21st] The Northeast Bandit Suppression Headquarters released a Changchun battle report: The Bandit Suppression Headquarters recently received a cable from General Zheng Dongguo, commander of the Changchun garrison, to the President at 11:00 PM on the 20th, the original text of which is as follows: "At 7:00 PM on October 19th, I personally cabled to report that I, leading Deputy Chief of Staff Yang Youmei, the headquarters, and the entire officer corps of the special service regiment (two battalions), along with Provincial Government Secretary Cui Chuiyan, totaling about one thousand people, firmly defended the Central Bank. On October 19th, in a day of fierce fighting, we killed or wounded 300 bandits, while we suffered over a hundred casualties. The night became quiet, but small groups of bandits continued to approach, attempting a surprise attack, all of which were repelled. From this morning until 5:00 PM, there were only sporadic battles. After dusk, the bandits suddenly launched a fierce attack, taking advantage of their superior artillery fire to seize field fortifications within dozens of steps of our Central Bank building. The soldiers defending the outer perimeter all heroically sacrificed themselves. We are now only defending the interior of the building, with dwindling troops and ammunition. The overall situation cannot be salvaged, resulting in the loss of the revolution, which I deeply regret. I will abide by your teachings, fulfill my military duty, preserve national integrity, and not disgrace your mandate. However, the country is in great difficulty, and I deeply regret that I cannot continue to follow you and share your burdens in completing the revolutionary cause. Time is pressing. I respectfully report this by cable, Zheng Dongguo, personally sealed at 11:00 PM on the night of October 20th."

### Executive Yuan Information Bureau Hosts Reporters: Director Dong Answers Questions; Lai Parkhan's Aid-to-China Talk Has Encouraging Implications; Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Exceeded US$130 Million

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] Dong Xianguang, Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau, answered the following questions at a press conference on the 21st:

Mr. Lai advocated that aid to China should be long-term, just as the Marshall Plan for Europe should be implemented for a full four years. If this recommendation can be realized, it will further enable us to overcome the current difficulties. China's suppression of the rebellion is not only for its own benefit, but also for maintaining the democratic status of the entire Asia. Then, as a result of its struggle, the United States will continue to aid China, coupled with China's own efforts, which will be sufficient to determine the inevitable end of the communist bandits.

(2) As of September 20th, the total value of gold, silver, and foreign currency exchanged by the government was US$131,333,279.

(3) According to news from the National Treasury Bureau and the Central Bank, as of October 18th, the five major state-owned enterprises sold shares in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Taiwan, totaling 4,419,700 gold yuan.

### "United Nations Day": We Celebrate Together

During the press conference, Director Dong also stated that the 24th is the third anniversary of the implementation of the United Nations Charter. Countries around the world have designated this day as "United Nations Day" to commemorate it, and our country also intends to celebrate it together. In today's turbulent world situation, the United Nations is undoubtedly a sign of a bright future for the world. We must understand this meaning when commemorating United Nations Day.

Since the establishment of the United Nations, China has fully supported this organization and all its constructive affiliated institutions, and will continue to support it. China will unconditionally support all perfect plans that can promote and strengthen the purposes of this great organization.

### Premier Weng Convenes Meeting: Comprehensive Review of Economic Situation; Remedial Measures Have Been Decided; Price Limits Deemed Unreasonable Will Be Adjusted; Daily Necessities Will Be Rationed With Coupons on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] Executive Yuan Premier Weng Wenhao convened a meeting at the Premier's Residence No. 1 on the morning of the 21st, bringing together Wang Yunwu, Guan Jiyu, Li Weiguo, Xu Baoguo, Shen Yi, and Liu Gongyun and Jiang Jingguo, who had just arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai. The economic situation since the currency reform and other issues were all discussed thoroughly, and a number of measures to remedy past shortcomings have been decided and will be implemented soon. During the discussion, it was generally agreed that the current phenomenon of panic buying was not due to a lack of supplies, but rather to merchants challenging price limits. To remedy this, reasonable adjustments will be proactively made to those price limits that were unreasonable in the past to give producers legitimate profits. However, after reasonable adjustments, merchants must not use this as an excuse to evade supplies. At the same time, the principle of freezing should still be maintained. Regarding the increase in production, in addition to partially opening up the use of self-provided foreign exchange to allow the import of production equipment, the government will also provide various assistance to production enterprises as much as possible. In addition, Liu Gongyun and Jiang Jingguo reported on the measures for adjusting the supply of materials for daily necessities in Nanjing and Shanghai, which were jointly formulated by merchants in Shanghai. Liu and Jiang returned to Shanghai by plane in the afternoon after attending the meeting. (Please see the news "Comprehensive Plan to Improve the Economy" on page 2)

### National Assembly to Review Current Situation Tomorrow Morning: Plenary Session of All Members to Be Held; Thirteenth Meeting Today to Continue Processing Backlogged Cases

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 21st] The National Assembly is scheduled to hold a plenary session of all members on the morning of the 23rd to review the current situation. A United Nations Day celebration will be held on the morning of the 24th, and Mr. Chen Lifu will be invited to deliver a speech.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 21st] The thirteenth meeting of the second session of the National Assembly is scheduled to be held on the 22nd. The discussion items listed on the agenda are all backlogged cases that have not been processed in previous meetings. There is also only one report item, namely the report from the Financial, Economic Resources, and Civil Law Committees on the joint review and amendment of the draft inheritance tax law. Because various tax rates have changed after the promulgation of the Financial and Economic Emergency Decree, it is proposed that the government's written replies to the inquiries related to the first and second secret meetings of the National Assembly be awaited. The proposal made by Cheng Tianfang and others to request the government to promptly submit various changed tax rates to the Assembly for review in order to complete the legislative process will be considered after the results are obtained so that there can be a basis for review.

Wang Fuzhou Attends Financial Committee to Report on Northeast Financial Problems

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 21st] The National Assembly's Financial Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 21st. Wang Fuzhou, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, attended to report on the Northeast financial problems and answer inquiries. According to Wang, the Central Bank branches had no choice but to issue a large number of promissory notes. The quantity and rate of expansion made it impossible for the government to allow the gold yuan to circulate in Changchun after the currency reform. If the circulating certificates were exchanged for gold yuan, the entire amount of gold yuan issued would be exhausted in a few months. Therefore, after careful consideration, the government decided to issue military grain coupons. Although there were also military grain coupons in Shenyang, they were debt instruments and could not be circulated, so there would be no adverse consequences. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has sent a telegram to stop the establishment of official silver houses in various parts of the Northeast. After answering questions, Wang left, and the meeting proceeded to discuss the draft National Treasury Law. It was amended and passed according to the preliminary review opinions and will be submitted to the Assembly for a final decision.

Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Met Yesterday; Minister Wang and Others Did Not Attend

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 21st] The National Assembly's Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission was originally scheduled to meet on the afternoon of the 21st to hear reports from Minister Wang of the Ministry of Finance and President Yu on overseas remittances and the collection and sale of foreign currency from overseas Chinese. When the convening committee met, fearing that too few members would attend in the afternoon, it was decided to notify Minister Wang and President Yu that they did not need to attend. To the surprise of the committee, the number of committee members attending in the afternoon was unexpectedly large, and as many as seventeen or eighteen reporters rushed to listen in. The chairman of the meeting, Huang Zhezhen, repeatedly sent the secretary to find and invite Wang and Yu, but the members waited for a long time and still could not find them. For a time, there was quite a bit of complaining, and some angrily accused Minister Wang and President Yu of looking down on the National Assembly. After Huang repeatedly explained and took the blame as the convener, the matter was dropped, and the grand meeting was declared a failure.

Editorial

### From Monetary Tightness to Floating Capital and Prices

The money supply in this city was once so loose that it was difficult to lend out even at interest rates of two or three percent. Recently, however, it has suddenly tightened, and the monthly interest rate has risen to nine or fifteen percent. For long-term lending, it has even exceeded thirty percent. According to those in the industry, it is unlikely that the situation will ease in the very short term. There are many reasons for this, but the main reason is the outflow of floating capital.

We have pointed out that the abundance of floating capital necessitates urgent guidance. Otherwise, it will pose a significant threat to general prices. Although price controls in this city have been effective and have largely maintained the "August 19" level, the lack of proper outlets has ultimately forced the outflow of large amounts of capital, leading to monetary tightening and soaring black market interest rates. This is not unexpected.

To stabilize the market, it is up to the national banks to manage the current issue of capital, adjusting surpluses and deficits to facilitate the turnover of legitimate industries and businesses. This should not be difficult to resolve. The real problem is how to absorb the surplus capital. Accumulating it in this city or diverting it to other places is merely a regional transfer and does not substantively solve the problem. Recently, prices in Guangzhou and the Southwest have soared, and materials on the inland railway lines are being hidden, preventing exchange between urban and rural areas, and farmers are unwilling to bring agricultural products to market. This illustrates the severity of the problem!

The central authorities have announced that they have developed a comprehensive plan to guide floating capital. The specific measures include the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks, the sale of enemy, puppet, and surplus properties, the issuance of gold yuan treasury bills and jewelry lottery tickets, and the increase in capital of banks and firms. In addition, there are proposals to issue corporate bonds, gold yuan government bonds, and allow state-owned enterprise stocks to be guaranteed interest. We believe that any measure, if it is to be attractive and encourage the investment of floating capital, must grasp two key points: (1) preferential returns; (2) ease of resale. The recent large outflow of floating capital proves the validity of the first point, while the sales or disposals of other items, except for jewelry lottery tickets, have not been as successful as desired, which also shows that the second point is indeed worthy of attention.

Market interest rates have been limited by the government and should be gradually reduced. Financial authorities in various regions are also paying close attention to this and working hard to suppress them. The amount of inward remittances and cash carried has been restricted and strictly inspected, but the outflow of capital has not been completely curbed. This also reflects that where the profit is, water flows downward, and relying solely on laws may not be effective.

Finance is like blood, running through the entire body of economic life. It is especially sensitive and stimulating, and its fluctuations and flows greatly affect the general economy. In the early days of the new currency, the government's biggest goals are to consolidate the currency value and strictly enforce price controls. Stabilizing the currency value and prices cannot be achieved without stabilizing finance at the same time. Therefore, the high lending rates reflect the urgency of the floating capital problem.

Premier Weng recently declared in the Legislative Yuan that he would reorganize the market, and his method is to do everything possible to crack down on hoarding and profiteering, dredge up the source of materials, and impose reasonable price limits according to the principles of fairness. Minister Wang also listed five measures to stabilize prices, which is naturally what everyone is eagerly looking forward to. However, price changes, the rise and fall of hoarding, and whether price limits can be maintained are closely related to the amount of floating capital. This can be proven by the hoarding situation in the legal tender era and the recent price surge in Guangzhou. Even the recent buying frenzy in various places, although extremely scattered, does not seem to be hoarding, but it may not be a method of breaking it up into smaller parts. Also, the rush to buy has increased the demand for funds, which has strengthened the tightening of monetary policy and the rise of dark interest. Therefore, interest rates and floating capital, floating capital and hoarding, and hoarding and prices form a chain relationship. If any link is improperly adjusted and an abnormal phenomenon occurs, it will affect the other parts. We hope that the authorities' plan to guide floating capital can be released as soon as possible and work in conjunction with price stabilization measures to achieve a mutually beneficial effect.

### The Executive Yuan Has Prepared Methods for Overall Economic Improvement; Secretary-General of the Huazhong Bandit Suppression Headquarters Political Affairs Committee Announces

[Our Hankou Correspondent, 21st] Yuan Shouyi, Secretary-General of the Political Affairs Committee of the Huazhong Bandit Suppression Headquarters, invited the press on the morning of the 21st to hold a forum to solicit management opinions.

### Taiwan Prices Rise Madly; Taipei Business Community Asks to Restore Flexible Adjustment of Taiwan Currency; Measures for Rationing Daily Necessities Decided

Taipei [Our Correspondent, 21st] Following the buying frenzy, prices in Taipei are rising madly. Today, the price of rice is 420 yuan per Taiwan catty. Sugar and oil are not available for purchase. Other items such as cigarettes and cloth have risen by an average of 80 percent. Illegal black markets for gold and U.S. dollars have reached alarming levels. General opinion is that the convening of the Exposition and the Engineers' Association has aggravated the sensitive psychology of merchants regarding the disparity in the supply of materials. Official opinion is that it is affected by the mainland, and is currently considering making household rations more widespread to ease people's minds. The Taipei business community held an emergency meeting today and telegraphed Chairman Wei, requesting the central government to restore the flexible adjustment of the Taiwan currency.

Zhenjiang [Our Correspondent, 21st] The overall rationing of daily necessities in Zhenjiang has been decided by the various trade associations today, and will be implemented starting on the first of next month. The quantities are three dou of rice per month for each large household, one liang of oil per day, half a jin of sugar per month, one zhi five chi of cloth every three months (military and public personnel have separate supply offices), six bars of soap per month, ten small packs of matches per month, and four liang of kerosene per day. Except for sugar, soap, and kerosene, where there is no distinction between large and small households, and matches, which small children are not entitled to, the rest are halved for small households.

Wuxi [Our Correspondent, 21st] Oil factories have only 2,000 dan of oil in stock, which is not enough to supply military and civilian use. Today, in response to the request of more than 300 wineries and sauce shops in the city, they were allowed to allocate more than 100 dan at a time. In addition, before August 19, there were 900,000 dan of wheat and 800,000 dan of rice, grains, and miscellaneous grains stored in Wuxi. Now there are only 300,000 dan in total, a huge difference. Now another 20% of rice and grains, about 20,000 shi, is being extracted to supply for sale at flat prices, temporarily maintaining food for the people. In addition, 15 industries, including rice, wheat, flour, sugar, oil, cigarettes, paper, and yarn, have prepared to form a joint distribution agency, which will soon purchase and distribute.

Suzhou [Our Correspondent, 21st] A panic suddenly broke out in Suzhou over the past few days, with rice shops having no goods to supply the market. In rural areas, the strong would rob the rice being transported to the city halfway. Flour is also in short supply. Although there are 18 groups of food supply offices, the quantity is small and the rice is of poor quality, and the crowding of buyers prevents it from being widespread. The competent authorities have now decided to implement comprehensive rationing, starting with major daily necessities such as rice, flour, oil, and cloth.

Changshu [Our Correspondent, 21st] Materials are extremely scarce in the urban area here, and the black market in various villages is extremely rampant. Some unscrupulous merchants are taking the opportunity to refuse to sell, and secretly transport them to the villages at night in order to seek high prices. In view of this, the county authorities have set up checkpoints at important water and land transportation routes, and have successively seized a large number of materials, including cotton yarn, flour, peanuts, yellow wine, and white candle oil, and handed them over to the police for handling. In addition, it is stipulated that people must not buy more than two days' worth of daily necessities to show restrictions.

Nantong [Our Correspondent, 21st] The Suppression and Construction Team is stepping up its economic inspection work. It has investigated and found many cases of scalpers and black market traders in the past few days, and imposed penalties of detention and parading through the streets. A trial sale of fresh meat by public auction was launched on the 21st. The stock of sugar is low, and it will be suspended for one day on the 22nd. Distribution will begin on the 23rd, limited to new mothers and patients.

Jiangyin [Our Correspondent, 21st] Merchants from Nantong often purchase large quantities of rice and grains from Wuxi at Huangtiangang, and ship them out in a steady stream. The inspection office did not intercept them because the documents were complete. Now Fortress Commander Dai has ordered that rice ships be temporarily banned from exporting until they are investigated and unbanned. In addition, the inspection office found that Ji Guangming, a native of Jingjiang, was smuggling a large number of silver ornaments out of the country, and handed them over to the Fortress Headquarters for interrogation.

Xiamen [Our Correspondent, 21st] Recently, many soldiers without badges have been found in the market, buying items by force and not paying. Three cases occurred yesterday alone.

The material shortage in Hangzhou is still severe, and the buying frenzy has spread to all industries. The sale of rice is still scarce, and the store windows are empty. However, Mayor Zhou said that the panic over rice can be eliminated, and Jiangxi rice will continue to come to Hangzhou. The police will send personnel to supervise the sale of rice, and material inspections will continue to be carried out strictly.

### Central Bank of Guizhou Again Commits Fraud in Gold Redemption; Manager Colludes with Appraisers in Cahoots; Underreporting Purchases and Overreporting Sales Found to Be True

[Our Guilin Correspondent, 21st] The Guizhou Central Bank's currency case is not yet over, and now there is a gold case. Wu Guangming, the bank's manager, colluded with appraisers to commit fraud. When redeeming gold, they lowered the fineness and then raised the fineness when transferring accounts. It was reported secretly, and the supervisor Liao Heming went to the bank to investigate. The investigation found that three gold bars received by the bank on the 12th of this month were received at 82 percent fineness and transferred at 93 percent fineness, proving that they were undoubtedly committing fraud. More than 9,000 taels of gold received by the bank have been sealed by Supervisor Liao. Appraiser Luo Jitai and the owner of the gold shop, Ming Qi, fled upon hearing the news. His brothers Luo Xingyuan and Luo Zhaolin have been detained by the District Procuratorate. This case will be revealed soon.

[Another dispatch] The currency case that caused a sensation here seems to be coming to an end. Li Mo, the auditor sent by the head office to investigate the case, said that (1) there was no evidence of corruption in the accounts of the Central Bank; (2) The head office's telegram on August 21 did not specify whether it should be announced, so Wu Guangming is not legally responsible for whether or not it is announced. (3) It is rumored that the Central Bank went to other ports to collect nickel coins, but the transportation cost was too expensive, so it was not possible. The problem of purchasing and profiting locally is not serious. (3) The Central Bank originally had more than 19,000 yuan in nickel coins, which was verified by the District Procuratorate to have been stored in Guiyang before Guizhou fell, and returned after the recovery, and was reported to the head office before the currency change.

### Hu Shi Sends Letter to All National Assembly Members, Suggesting the Formulation of Municipal Autonomy Law Procedures

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Hu Shi, Chairman of the Beiping and Tianjin Civic Autonomy Promotion Association, specially sent a letter to all National Assembly members today regarding the formulation of the Municipal Autonomy Law. The original letter reads: The Beiping and Tianjin Civic Autonomy Promotion Association passed a resolution at its annual meeting on the 3rd of this month, "Please the Legislative Yuan to formulate municipal or directly-administered municipal autonomy regulations as soon as possible." Because we feel that cities (especially directly-administered municipalities) are the centers of modern culture in our country, the most densely populated areas, with highly developed industry and commerce, and a higher level of public knowledge, it seems easier to start democratic politics in cities. Article 28 of the Constitution stipulates that "the autonomy of directly-administered municipalities shall be determined by law," and specifies that directly-administered municipalities may formulate autonomy laws based on the autonomy regulations. The status of directly-administered municipalities should be comparable to that of provinces. Articles 64 and 91 of the Constitution also mention provinces and directly-administered municipalities together. Some provincial capitals have smaller populations and lower cultures than directly-administered municipalities, so we advocate that the autonomy of directly-administered municipalities should at least be equal to the autonomy of provinces. Therefore, from the standpoint of promoting civic autonomy, this association makes the following suggestions to your esteemed hospital regarding the formulation of the Municipal Autonomy Law: The Legislative Yuan formulates municipal or directly-administered municipal autonomy regulations in accordance with Articles 28 and 128 of the Constitution. Municipalities or directly-administered municipalities may convene a citizens' representative assembly to formulate municipal autonomy laws in accordance with municipal or directly-administered municipal autonomy regulations. After the municipal or directly-administered municipal autonomy law is formulated, it will be submitted to the Judicial Yuan. If the Judicial Yuan believes that there is no violation of the Constitution, the autonomy law will be effective. The above is our humble opinion, respectfully offered to your colleagues in the hospital.

### Mr. Hu's Lecture at Zhejiang University: Liberalism and China

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 21st] Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, arrived in Hangzhou on the 18th. On the 20th, at the invitation of Zhu Kezhen, the president of Zhejiang University, he gave a lecture at the Zhejiang University gymnasium on the topic of "Liberalism and China." Mr. Hu first explained that liberalism is one of the greatest movements in the world today. He then elaborated on the liberalist thought of ancient Chinese Confucian scholars. From Confucius and Mencius downwards, such wise men as Wang Chong, Wang Anshi, Zhu Shunshui, and Huang Lizhou all had liberalist thoughts in their works. Therefore, what is called "liberalism" today is actually a "domestic product and not an imported product" of China. However, if there is only "liberalist thought" or "liberalist philosophy" without freedom in the political environment, then society still has no freedom to speak of, and China lacks this kind of political freedom. However, to obtain political freedom, there must be a spirit of tolerance to match it, and then liberalism can be perfectly realized. Therefore, the main demand for the victory of liberalism in China today lies in striving for political freedom and cultivating a general spirit of tolerance in society.

### Three Powers Accept Neutral Nations' Compromise Proposal - Turning Point in Berlin Problem - Vyshinsky Cables Kremlin for Instructions, Awaiting Reply - Security Council to Resume Discussion Today

[United Press, Paris, 21st] The three Western powers decided on the 21st to accept the so-called mediation plan of neutral nations, celebrating the lifting of the Berlin blockade and the West giving up its accusations against the Soviet Union of threatening peace. Thus, a turning point in the Berlin crisis suddenly opened up a bright future. The compromise plan proposed by the neutral nations advocates that the Soviet Union first lift the Berlin blockade, and then the four powers will once again discuss the Berlin currency and the German peace treaty. According to reports, after several consultations between Argentine representative Bramuglia, chairman of the Security Council, and Soviet representative Vyshinsky, the compromise was drafted and submitted to Vyshinsky and Western countries this morning. Vyshinsky immediately forwarded it to Moscow so that the Kremlin's reply could be received before the Security Council resumes its discussion on the Berlin crisis tomorrow. Western representatives believe that they are very willing for the Soviet Union to recognize the plan as a "promising basis" to resolve the East-West crisis. Rumors of the West's reluctance to urgently accuse the Soviet Union have been circulating for many days, but the blockade of Berlin must be lifted. Therefore, when Vyshinsky stood up in the Security Council to request access to the compromise proposal, the hope of peacefully resolving the crisis suddenly increased. The compromise plan has not yet been finalized. According to information, there are the following three methods: (1) unconditionally lift the Berlin blockade; (2) the four powers will re-discuss the Berlin currency system, or it will be held at the same time as the lifting of the blockade; (3) after the blockade is lifted and before the currency system problem is resolved, the four foreign ministers will hold another meeting to discuss the German problem. Because Bramuglia had several meetings with Vyshinsky, it is generally believed that breaking the deadlock is still possible. Based on this, the West no longer insists that the United Nations declare to the world that the Soviet Union is a threat to peace. A Western diplomat said, "We hope to lift the Berlin blockade. Now that the method of lifting the blockade has been found, we are also unwilling to argue too much with the Soviet Union, because the blockade is a threat to peace." As both sides have adopted new positions, the wording of the neutral nations' plan is also becoming more active rather than passive. In short, the current focus is on lifting the blockade rather than condemning the Soviet Union.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 20th] Rumors are rife that Molotov will come to Paris within twelve days, and these rumors may become a reality.

[United Press, Moscow, 20th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with British Ambassador Peterson on the 20th for a 45-minute meeting.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 20th] Representatives of various countries at the United Nations today received a white paper on the German issue issued by the Polish Embassy in London. The introduction to the book stated that the German issue can only be resolved through the agreement of the four powers and by respecting the reasonable demands of Germany's neighboring countries issued by the German Embassy. Poland opposes the policy of dividing Europe and dividing spheres of influence. Poland insists that European countries should cooperate equally and reciprocally in the United Nations organization.

### Political Committee Passes Mexican Proposal - Draft Declaration of Friendship and Understanding - Dulles Guarantees Willingness to Seek Cooperation with the Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st] When the UN General Assembly Political Committee met today, the Mexican representative proposed that major powers should strive to resolve differences between countries in order to achieve lasting peace. This motion was unanimously passed by the committee, creating an unprecedented atmosphere of harmony. The first to express support for this motion was US representative Dulles (Republican foreign policy advisor). He said that the US representatives welcome the Mexican representative's proposal and accept the basic principles in the bill.

We are deeply aware that countries that have made great contributions to the victory of the war should have the right to make active and constructive contributions. If this right is not used, all member states of the United Nations will be concerned about the consequences. In other words, major powers not only have the right, but also have the obligation. If major powers do not properly fulfill this obligation, other countries should pay attention to this matter. He also said that the reason for the breakdown of the first foreign ministers' meeting was that "one of the three participating countries hoped to prevent the other two countries among the five from participating in the drafting of the treaty." The implication is that the Soviet Union attempted to prevent China and France from participating in the discussion of the treaties with Germany's satellite states. He finally guaranteed that the United States will strive to seek cooperation with the Soviet Union. Representatives of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union suggested that a subcommittee including the five powers and Mexico should be established to draft a declaration of friendship and understanding. Therefore, the subcommittee was immediately established and authorized to draft a bill of friendship and understanding to be submitted to the Political Committee.

### West Berlin Prepares for General Election

[This newspaper's dispatch] London, 21st broadcast, Berlin dispatch: Regardless of Soviet opposition, Western and German authorities began to implement plans to hold elections in Berlin on the 21st. Officials said that even if the Soviet occupation zone prevents the election, Germans in the western occupied zones will vote on December 5 to elect a new municipal government. Although Berlin city officials and Western Allied commanders are worried that the election will result in two municipal governments, they are still determined to proceed. Soviet commander of Berlin, Kotikov, informed acting Mayor Friedensburg that unless West Berlin restores democracy and reunites, he will not allow elections to be held. US Commander of Berlin, Colonel Holay, criticized Kotikov's remarks as nonsense, saying, "I am used to listening to Soviet arguments. I dare say Kotikov has rejected the election." He pointed out that the Soviet Union does not hold elections because it fears that Germans will thus have the opportunity to announce their views to the world.

### White House Holds National Defense Conference - Clay Invited to Attend

Clay told reporters that his return visit did not involve "urgent matters." He said that he hopes to meet with Secretary of the Army Royall and Acting Secretary of State Lovett, but said that such meetings are only routine.

He said: "Archbishop Spellman invited me to speak at the Smith dinner, which is the only reason I returned home."

### South Korean Rebel Police Brigade Retreating South Toward Gurye - South Gwangju Government Defeats Motley Rebel Army

[United Press, Seoul, 21st] Korean troops and police loyal to the government defeated a motley rebel army led by communists south of Suncheon on the 21st. The main force of the rebel army, about 3,800 people, is said to have fled into the mountains.

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 21st] The US military headquarters announced at noon today that the rebel guard unit is retreating south toward Gurye. The US military headquarters abruptly broke its 36-hour silence and issued a brief statement stating that no other guard units have been reported to have taken disloyal actions.

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 21st] 2,500 rebellious Korean police have completely occupied Yeosu, and have also partially occupied Suncheon, 20 miles north of Yeosu. It is said that they were blocked between Suncheon and Gurye (40 miles by air north of Yeosu) this morning. Therefore, the rumors that spread last night that the rebel army had entered 75 miles inland from the coastal city at the southwestern tip of South Korea (i.e. Yeosu) have been clarified. According to Korean Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Lee Beom-seok, two brigades of regular troops are being dispatched from Jeonju to suppress the rebellion. Senior Korean military officers, including Commander-in-Chief Song Ho, and several staff members are believed to have flown to Gwangju this morning to deal with the situation.

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 21st] South Korean Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Lee Beom-seok declared at a press conference at noon today that government forces have taken the initiative in the operations in the southernmost part of Korea. Three companies of the army were transferred from Gwangju to the area on the 20th, and officials from the South Korean General Staff also flew from Seoul to Gwangju. According to Lee, the rebels have now fled to Chilisan (transliteration) and will adopt guerrilla tactics against the government forces. Lee criticized far-right politicians who returned from China for also participating in the rebellion. This statement was obviously referring to Kim Gu, a 73-year-old exile in China for many years and a mortal enemy of the Lee Seung-man regime. He also said that the rebel army, assisted by communist farmers, has hung the North Korean red star flag on public buildings in Yeosu.

[United Press, Seoul, 21st] Amid the communist uprising in Korea, the Korean Minister of the Interior has declared martial law throughout South Korea as a precautionary measure. According to the latest news, the rebellious police force has crossed Goheung, 50 miles north of Yeosu, and is attacking Gwangju. It is generally believed that the communist fifth column in Gwangju city is waiting to join the rebel army. The Minister of the Interior declared that the leading units loyal to the government are on their way to Gwangju, and a decisive battle may occur between the government forces and the rebel army in the city. He refused to say how many reinforcements were on their way to Gwangju and predicted that the rebel army could be wiped out within two weeks.

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 21st] A communiqué issued today by the US military headquarters in South Korea confirmed that the entire 2,500-member 14th Regiment of the 5th Division of the South Korean New Army in Yeosu rebelled in protest against the government's order to transfer them to Jeju Island to suppress the farmers and police on the island. The rebel army took a northbound train to occupy Songju and reached Namwon (transliteration) south of Yeosu, where they were resolutely resisted by the government's regular army and retreated back to Songju.

[United Press, Seoul, 21st] Local Korean military sources said on the morning of the 21st: "The rebel army is currently scattered in the area near Gwangju in southern Jeolla Province."

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 21st] The South Korean national police have been on alert since the night of the 20th and have received a large number of rifles and machine guns. The government authorities held several meetings in Seoul that night, but the situation in Seoul is still calm. According to general observers, the rebellion was caused by the South Korean people's dissatisfaction with the Lee Seung-man regime. The government may be able to quell the rebellion, but it cannot quell the growing dissatisfaction of the South Korean people forever.

### US State Department and Army Department Watching South Korean Rebellion - US Military Avoiding Taking Actual Action

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] US Acting Secretary of State Lovett said today that the State Department has not received any official reports on the rebellion in South Korea and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea. Another official said that the State Department and the Army Department are closely monitoring the development of the situation in Korea. He also said that if the situation there deteriorates, the commander of the US Army in South Korea can take action immediately. Diplomatic sources here said that it is difficult to believe the withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea. According to sources in Washington, the masters of the Kremlin may use the instability in South Korea as an excuse to delay the withdrawal of troops.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th, United Press] Government officials here, including army officers, believe that there is no reason to use the US military in the event of a rebellion in Korea, but it may also depend on the wishes of the Korean government. Therefore, US commanders should avoid actual action unless requested by the South Korean government led by Lee Seung-man.

### Soviet Newspaper Criticizes US - Undermining Agreement on Korea

Korea Becomes US Military Base

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 21st] New Times Weekly commented on the issue of "restoring diplomatic relations with the North Korean People's Government," attacking Washington politicians for undermining the Moscow agreement on Korea, saying: The United States intends to make Korea a colony of the United States for US economic expansion and as an important military strategic base in the Far East.

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 20th] Authoritative sources said on the 20th that the Israeli government has ordered the Jewish army in the Negev region to cease fire in order to comply with the Security Council's order. The source claimed that the ceasefire decision was decided at an emergency cabinet meeting attended for the first time by Israeli Acting President Weizmann.

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 21st] Unruly elements of the Israeli army occupied Beersheba, Egypt's main base in the Holy Land, on the 21st, minutes before the Israeli government accepted the United Nations' order to cease fire in the Negev region. The United Nations Truce Supervision Organization here has telegraphed this matter to Paris. An Israeli military spokesman announced that the Israeli government has ordered the commanders of the Jewish army in the Negev region of southern Palestine to "cease fire as soon as there is no war in the Negev or elsewhere." The cabinet met to draft a document accepting the Security Council's ceasefire order. He said that the acceptance statement may be telegraphed to the UN General Assembly in Paris on the 21st. The Israeli army has occupied several places in the Negev battle and is now determined to hold on to them in order to play a role when the United Nations decides how the area should be assigned. Reliable sources said that residents of several Arab villages along the Medar and Bethlehem highways have fled, so most of them have fallen into the hands of the Jewish army.

### After Allied Powers Sign Peace Treaty with Japan - Occupying Forces Should Still Remain - Shigeru Yoshida Announces at Foreign Press Conference

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Prime Minister Yoshida believes that if the international situation is still as chaotic as it is now when the peace treaty with Japan is signed, then even after the peace treaty is signed, the occupying forces should still remain in Japan. Yoshida said at a foreign press conference this morning that Japan does not want to be invaded by foreign forces. If the occupying forces withdraw, Japan's domestic security will be threatened. Yoshida pointed out that Japan currently only has 125,000 policemen, whose equipment is poor and weapons are insufficient. The riot by Koreans in Kobe in March this year, which kidnapped the county magistrate, proves the weakness of the Japanese police force. However, he refused to comment on what strength the Japanese police should have. Regarding the economy, Yoshida said that he will make every effort to restore Japan's free economic system. He believes that it may be very difficult to implement a completely free economic system under the current circumstances, but he guarantees that government controls will be kept to a minimum. Yoshida also said that he will strive to restore international confidence in Japan and find ways to make the Japanese economy self-sufficient. Regarding Japanese political issues, Yoshida said: I want to dissolve the parliament. He also admitted that he has not been able to obtain a majority of votes in the parliament, so he will find it difficult to control this legislative body.

[This newspaper's dispatch] There should be no problem with the supply of rice in the city in the short term. Yang Chuo'an, chairman of the Grain Purchase and Storage Committee, went to the supervisor's office yesterday morning to negotiate and guaranteed to supply two-thirds of the city's food. As for the remaining one-third of the rice, which is within the scope of free purchase, rice merchants are also actively purchasing from various other ports. 4,000 tons of Nanchang rice have begun to be shipped to Shanghai. The supervisor's office has telegraphed the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau to allocate two trains per day to transport it. Wan Molin also went to the Central Bank yesterday to contact them, requesting the operating authorities to approve 20,000 bolts of cloth foreign exchange to exchange for rice and grain from other ports. As for the supply of flour, there are still problems with raw materials.

After the distribution of rice for October in the city began on the 16th, citizens rushed to buy it, causing the distributed rice that was in transit to be unable to connect. Mayor Wu specially invited Speaker Pan, Commander Xuan, Chairman Fang, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, Chairman Yang of the Grain Storage and Purchase Committee, and Director Lu of the Civil Food Allocation Office to a temporary meeting in the city government reception room at 4 pm yesterday to discuss issues such as accelerating the transportation to Shanghai and the distribution of rice.

Mayor Wu also told reporters after the meeting that 100,000 piculs of rice will be shipped to Shanghai one after another within a week. The authorities are now making every effort to dredge rice sources, so there is no fear of food panic among the people. The original dates for the sale of rice to the public in the city were from the 5th to the end of the month. Because the distribution of rice for this month began on the 16th, those with ID cards can purchase household rice until the extended deadline.

The authorities have also made the greatest efforts to maintain power. Although the coal shortage is still severe, coal is being actively transported from Taiwan and Huainan, supplemented by a portion of foreign coal, so there should be no concern about coal for industrial use in the next month. As for the coal dross distributed to the public, it has long been resolved.

### Public Utilities Subsidized a Total of Eight Million Yuan in September

Whether or Not to Subsidize this Month is Under Review

The various public utility companies in this city were approved by the central government in September to receive a total of eight million gold yuan in subsidies. The funds have already been advanced by the national bank and have been claimed by the respective companies. However, whether to continue the subsidies after October or whether to approve adjustments is currently being requested from the central government by the Public Utilities Bureau, and they are awaiting orders.

### Shipping Industry Faces Serious Danger, Joint Meeting of Shipping Association Directors and Supervisors Decides to Send Representatives to Nanjing to Appeal

〔Our Report〕Standing directors and supervisors of the Shipping Association and directors and supervisors of the Shanghai Association held a joint meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday to review the difficulties in the shipping industry. All directors and supervisors agreed that the shipping industry is facing a serious crisis and that ways must be found to rescue it. (1) As of August 19th, freight rates were 87% below cost, and the increase in fuel prices on October 1st made the gap even wider, increasing to 114%. In terms of the difference in fuel prices alone, the shipping companies in Shanghai must lose more than six million gold yuan per month, but freight rates have not been adjusted to date. (2) The fuel quota has always been insufficient for actual needs, but the fuel price has been adjusted and the quota has been sharply reduced. The October allocation is only 37.5% of the original quota, which is even more insufficient. (3) Food rice and cooking oil are scarce in Shanghai and cannot be purchased. It is difficult for the ships to supply food to the crew and passengers. This panic phenomenon is increasing. Repeated appeals have been made to the government to make reasonable adjustments to freight rates, or to cancel the increase in fuel prices, or to subsidize the difference in fuel prices, and to fully supply fuel oil and food rice and cooking oil for ships, but none of these have been done. The shipping industry is trying to maintain transportation and sacrificing itself with pain, but it is now exhausted and cannot maintain it. Therefore, it was decided to send representatives to Nanjing to appeal to the government to quickly resolve the above problems. Under the current difficult situation, in addition to making efforts to operate on the main routes, the shipping companies will consider reducing the number of voyages. If the ships are unable to purchase food, the passengers will have to bring their own dry food, and the ships will not provide meals.

Except for Luo Fuzhang and Chen Jinchu, who did not appear in court, all the other defendants appeared in court to answer questions. The testimonies of Xu Rongsheng and the other seven people were almost identical, all claiming that the broken rice distributed to the rice stores they opened by the Civil Mediation Committee was not purchased by anyone, so they sold their own good rice, and the remaining broken rice belonged to them and could be used to offset the liquor payment. The court stated that the testimonies of the defendants still need to be investigated by the Yangjing Sub-bureau and the Civil Mediation Committee, and ordered a change of date for another trial.

### Although Market Interest Rates are High, Credit Shows Slight Easing

〔Commodity Investigation News〕The tight credit situation continued yesterday. The turnover in the market seemed to be slightly easier than before. Because the panic buying of goods has reached its climax, most merchants are now holding goods and not selling them, and those who own funds have to offer them. Market interest rates are still between 6 and 7 yuan per day, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of more than 1.8%. The phenomenon of a shortage of orders in silver and money houses is still common. It is reported that the main reasons for this credit crunch are (1) the reduction in the source of funds, (2) the public's rush to withdraw cash, and (3) the outflow of hot money.

The Banking Association recently issued a circular to all banks and money houses in the city stating that if a customer's check is returned due to insufficient funds or overdraft, they should immediately report it to the Financial Management Bureau for punishment and not tolerate it in any way.

### Silk is Stable

People's silk stabilized after the China Trust Bureau explained yesterday that the silk weaving industry on this street would continue to be distributed as usual.

Silk shops have slightly sold some retail goods, and the trend is stable. There is still no supply of raw silk on the market, and no transactions have been heard.

The second phase of silk distribution is about to begin. The factory still has to return the finished product to the raw materials it receives, so there is not much stock left. Recently, raw materials are priced but there is no goods, and the output has been greatly reduced, so there is no spot supply in the market. Most of the stocks held by wholesalers are waiting and not selling, and transactions in the market are deserted. Because door-to-door merchants on this street cannot purchase after coming, retail sales are also limited, and popular goods are not displayed. Cold goods or colors that do not match the season are still available.
