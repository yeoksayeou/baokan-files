### "Peace is More Difficult Than War"

Hu Shih Discusses His Views on the Current Situation

[Central News Agency, This City] Dr. Hu Shih, President of Peking University, spoke to reporters yesterday about his views on the current situation. His view is: "Peace is more difficult than war." He elaborated, saying: "Peace requires all kinds of determination, requiring both wisdom, benevolence, and courage, especially requiring mutual tolerance and sacrifice from all sides, so peace is very difficult, while war is easy. Carelessness can lead to war. The large and small wars in history all prove that "peace is more difficult than war," with very few exceptions. General Marshall, as one of the supreme commanders of the Allied forces, defeated Germany and Japan, and can be called a victorious general. He came to China to preside over peace talks, but failed, as expected. This is the best example. Many people do not understand this, and often ask why there is no peace. This is because they do not understand the difficulty of peace."

### The Moral Foundation of Freedom of the Press: Opening of the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information

The United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information opened today in Geneva, the "World Country." Five or six hundred famous reporters, political commentators, and government representatives from all over the world gathered together to discuss the theory and practice of freedom of the press at length, and will formulate an international charter of freedom of the press, a code for the press in all countries to follow. This conference is an unprecedented international conference in the history of the world's press, and it is also related to the well-being and continued benefits of our own journalists, so it is naturally worthy of our attention. As it opens, we, standing in the position of the newspaper industry, cannot but express our views slightly for the reference of the representatives of various countries.

The international freedom of the press movement emerged during the Second World War. When the war was in full swing, people all over the world suffered the cruel lessons of the war, and they all hoped that this war would be the last war of mankind, but to achieve this goal, domestic democracy and international understanding in all countries are indispensable, so the international freedom of the press movement was advocated. The so-called "freedom of the press" includes freedom of speech and freedom of news gathering, transmission, and publication. Therefore, this movement has a dual meaning, internal and external. In other words, internally, it requires the government not to interfere with freedom of speech and news gathering, transmission, and publication, so that public opinion can be fully expressed directly, and indirectly so that all government policies are based on public opinion, so as to promote the realization of domestic peace and democracy. As for the external aspect, it is to strive for international freedom of the press. As long as they are current journalists, they can go to any country to engage in news gathering without being interfered with by the government of the host country, and the transmission of the news they gather is also not subject to the inspection of the government of the host country. This will eliminate international misunderstandings, enhance understanding between countries, and prevent any form of secret diplomacy from being carried out in secret, resulting in international wars. Therefore, the international freedom of the press movement after the war is actually a movement to end war through ideas. The late US President Roosevelt attached importance to "freedom of speech and expression" and listed it as the first of the "Four Freedoms" he advocated, and this is also the reason for it.

The convocation of this United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information dates back to December 14, 1946, when the United Nations General Assembly had already passed a resolution declaring freedom of the press as one of the basic human rights and a touchstone for all freedoms. Later, on August 15, 1947, the fifth meeting of the Economic and Social Council made more concrete decisions and designated the Freedom of Information Subcommittee of the Human Rights Commission to be responsible for studying the concept of freedom of the press. In December of this year, all parties actively proceeded to discuss the agenda and declaration outline that the Conference on Freedom of Information should adopt. Although the opinions of all parties were not consistent, they decided on four main points in principle: (1) Freedom of the press includes the right to freedom of thought and speech without interference, and to seek, accept, and transmit news by all means and without boundaries. (2) It is very important to maintain, enhance, and distribute scientific and intellectual knowledge, and to promote public education and cultural dissemination. (3) Journalists have the right to go to the source of news by all possible means, and shall not be obstructed in any way during travel. (4) Freedom of the press and freedom of publication are also attached with obligations and responsibilities.

From this, it can be seen that the so-called freedom of the press is not complete freedom, without limitations. As the Chinese saying goes, "Two words can build a nation, one word can destroy a nation." A reporter's pen, whether recording news or writing articles, expressing opinions, must be cautious. According to the resolution of the Freedom of Information Subcommittee, the following events will be treated as exceptions to freedom of the press: (1) Events that must be kept secret for national security; (2) Speech that incites others to change the government system by violence; (3) Speech that directly incites others to commit crimes; (4) Obscene speech; (5) Speech that is harmful to fair legal proceedings; (6) Speech that infringes on literary and artistic property rights; (7) Speech that damages the reputation of others or is harmful to others and not beneficial to the public. The Chinese delegation attached particular importance to this issue and repeatedly called the attention of the delegates of various countries. Because individual freedom cannot harm the freedom of others, let alone harm the interests of the entire society, country, and nation. This principle has become a common principle observed by all countries, and freedom of the press is no exception. The subcommittee also drafted four basic principles that journalists should abide by: (1) Report based on facts, without prejudice; disseminate what is known, without malice. (2) Freely exchange news about world economic, social, and humanitarian issues to facilitate the solution of these issues. (3) Respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, regardless of race, gender, language, or religion, and should try to eliminate any harm to this, and should fight against any ideology that endangers such freedom and rights. (4) Seek mutual understanding and cooperation among all nations to maintain world peace, and at the same time eradicate all war-mongering and potential forces that incite war.

These four basic principles, in theory, are extremely perfect, but in practice, it is not easy to find a reporter who has these four conditions. Taking the current situation in China as an example, foreign journalists who come to China to gather news are given a high degree of freedom and convenience, whether in gathering or transmitting news, which is no less than any country in the world. Moreover, there are also newspapers and news agencies run by foreign journalists, newspapers have absolute freedom of speech, and news agencies have no restrictions on sending telegrams and manuscripts. The ideal of freedom of the press

### Shanghai Conscription Lottery to be Held Today

The annual conscription is about to begin in Shanghai, and the city is actively preparing for it. At 3:00 PM today, the city's military service administrative agencies and various public organizations will hold this year's indirect conscription lottery ceremony at the City Council. Regarding the method of drawing lots, it is said that the total number of conscripts assigned will be drawn from all eligible young men. Those who are drawn will not be immediately conscripted. When there are vacancies in the voluntary soldier registration, the drawn young men will be conscripted into the camp according to the order of the lottery numbers. This method is fair and reasonable, and it complies with the spirit of the Military Service Law, and it also facilitates the environment of Shanghai's first conscription lottery. We hope that the citizens of Shanghai will recognize the importance of military service and that the lottery is a necessary step for conscription, and that there will be no slightest illusion in their minds.

Serving in the military is a duty that citizens should fulfill, and it is also a right that citizens should enjoy. People with a sense of responsibility should have the concept of defending the country and protecting their hometown. Not only should they take the lead in serving in the military, but they should also persuade their children and neighbors to serve in the military, in order to fulfill their responsibilities as citizens. Now the entire world has entered an extraordinary period. European and American countries are actively preparing for military mobilization and universal military training for the people. The northern provinces of China are feeling the cruel destruction of the Communist bandits, the peaceful environment has been destroyed, local security and order are threatened, and the people's happiness and the cultivation of the land have lost good protection. At this critical juncture, in order to defend the country and protect our hometown, military mobilization is indeed very necessary and cannot be delayed. If there is no military mobilization, the national defense force cannot be established, and the local armed forces cannot be established. Therefore, citizens with a sense of responsibility understand the significance of military mobilization, and citizens who love their hometown and local area must be enthusiastic about serving the country or supporting the implementation of military service. Shanghai has only been handling military service for one year, and most people do not have enough understanding of the Military Service Law. Most people, especially, do not understand the relationship between military mobilization and national security and local security. It can be said that it has been fully realized in China. But experience tells us that the newspapers run by foreign journalists—even the Chinese-language newspapers they run—often publish words that violate the interests of our nation and country. Foreign news agencies also often distort facts and publish inaccurate news when reporting news, which has an adverse impact on China's international reputation, or deliberately provokes the feelings between China and friendly countries. We have to lodge a complaint with the Freedom of the Press Conference? Ask the delegates of all countries to fully understand the position of our delegation that the international freedom of the press system must be based on the foundation of national press ethics.

Therefore, we want to call on the citizens to pay fresh and strong attention and high vigilance to this important matter of government on the day of the conscription lottery.

The total quota for this year's conscription in Shanghai is 6,000, which is only slightly more than one-thousandth of the total population of 5 million. The conscription of these 6,000 soldiers will be carried out in combination with voluntary soldiers and conscription, which is not something that can be done in one go. The formal conscription fully takes into account the local environment of Shanghai. Voluntary soldiers are those who voluntarily serve in the military according to their own wishes and do not need to be forced; conscripts are those who are conscripted and serve in the military according to the provisions of the Military Service Law. The so-called eligible men refer to men who are 20 years old or older. All men who are fully 20 years old or men who are 21 to 25 years old have the obligation to be conscripted for military service according to the law. The lottery presided over by the military service agency today uses the roster of eligible men compiled based on the household survey and exemption applications handled last year, and under the supervision of various public organizations and public opinion, uses indirect methods to draw out who will serve in the military and the order in which they will serve, in order to be conscripted into the camp when the number of voluntary soldiers is insufficient. This method is fair and reasonable, and it is not favoritism or perfunctory. It is very much in line with the three principles of equality, fairness, and average. If the handling of the results is good, it will definitely establish a good atmosphere.

In addition, regarding the allocation of Shanghai's 6,000 military quotas after conscription, the City Council suggested that the principle of local training to protect Shanghai's security should be followed, and at the same time, it passed a resolution to establish the Songhu Garrison Brigade, and has already jointly sent a telegram to the Central Government with the local community to allocate the 6,000 military quotas to the brigade for service. This suggestion is based on the concept of protecting the local area, based on protecting the safety of the majority, and even more based on protecting the metropolis that is the source of national wealth. Calling on ambitious youths, talented people, and people with lofty ideals to bravely join the army and participate in this movement to defend the country and protect their hometown, we cannot express our good suggestions and hope that the central government will adopt them.

### Press Conference Aboard the Xing'an Ship; Gui Yongqing Reports on the Acquisition Process, Xu Shifu, Ship Captain

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] Gui Yongqing, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, held a press conference at 2:00 PM on the 22nd on the Xing'an, a repair ship recently returned from the United States. Gui and ship captain Xu Shifu successively reported on the acquisition process of the ship. Briefly stated: The transfer of the ship was based on the agreement between the Chinese and American governments in Nanjing on December 8 of last year in accordance with the United States 79th Congress No. 511 Act and the Executive Order No. 9842 issued by President Truman on April 25, 1947 (agreement on the transfer of ships). Ninety-nine officers and soldiers (sixteen officers and eighty-three soldiers) were assigned to the ship. Captain Xu Shifu took the U.S. Navy transport ship "General Breckenridge" from Qingdao to the United States on June 19 of last year, and handled the acquisition matters at the Port of New Orleans. The ship was originally named "Achilles" (repair ship), and began service in the Pacific in January 1943. During the island battles, it was seriously damaged twice during the landings on Buna Island in New Guinea and Leyte Island in the Philippines. After all the difficulties faced by our ship officers and soldiers, it was repaired after four months. During the voyage back home, it was repaired twice in San Francisco and Pearl Harbor, and arrived in the capital on the 19th of this month. According to reports: The Xing'an ship is 328 feet long, 50 feet wide, has a full load displacement of 3,319 tons, a draft of 13 feet, and a speed of 10 knots. It was originally a tank landing craft and was later converted into a repair ship for repairing infantry landing ships. Gui also expressed his admiration to the soldiers for their perseverance in overcoming difficulties, turning decay into magic, and completing the mission of acquiring the ship. Captain Xu expressed his deep indignation at the fact that unscrupulous people repeatedly slandered China's new navy and affected the reputation of the group. According to reports: When the ship arrived in the capital, officers and soldiers were only allowed to leave the ship after being observed by the acting commander-in-chief. However, rumors claimed that it carried a large number of private goods, which was a complete fabrication. Xu strongly appealed to the media to report fairly and clear up the matter. The first task of the ship after returning home is to be sent to the Philippines to repair the American ships moored there waiting to be received, and will be dismantled and utilized, or towed to the Kaohsiung shipyard for repairs. Once the passport procedures are completed, it will set off.

According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing: On its way back to China, the "Xing'an" received a warm welcome from overseas Chinese in various places, and when passing through Japan, it brought back 477 boxes of zinc plates of Chinese military maps made by the Japanese during the war, which were very valuable.

### New York Times Publishes: Zhang Junmai Explains the Status of Minority Parties

[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] The New York Times today published a long letter from Zhang Junmai, leader of China's National Socialist Party, clarifying the status of minority parties in China's government. He appealed to the American people for sympathetic understanding of China's situation in a moving tone. Zhang emphasized the following points: (1) Transforming a country with a population of 450 million and a long history of political habits into a modern democratic country is indeed an extraordinarily difficult task. (2) The Kuomintang's voluntary abandonment of one-party dictatorship is an extremely important and novel development. No modern dictatorial regime has ever taken this step. (3) The Communist Party should be responsible for the early breakdown of peace talks and the current civil unrest. (4) The reason why minority parties cooperate with the Kuomintang to produce the National Assembly and establish democracy is that although China cannot have peace due to the Communist Party, there is no reason to abandon democracy at the same time. (5) The people responsible for the Nanjing government are no less than their counterparts anywhere in the world in terms of honesty and integrity. (6) As far as the National Socialist Party is concerned (and I believe the Youth Party is the same), we will continue to work hard until the foundations of China's modern democracy are firmly established. (7) The results of this election are gratifying. Many non-party and non-factional people were elected. What is gratifying is that although they belong to the Kuomintang, they were freely elected by the people and not elected under the coercion of organized groups. According to reports, the New York Times published a report by its correspondent in China, Sai Dianan, on March 7, which criticized the minority party members in the Chinese government. Zhang wrote this letter to respond to it.

### Two Thousand Unemployed Overseas Chinese to be Repatriated from Japan

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] The Overseas Chinese Affairs Group of our mission in Japan plans to repatriate 2,000 unemployed overseas Chinese residents to the country within this year, most of whom are Taiwanese compatriots who were conscripted by the Japanese military during the war to work as laborers. After Japan's surrender, they engaged in the restaurant business. However, due to the food shortage in Japan, all overseas Chinese restaurants were closed down, and they became unemployed. Our mission in Japan originally planned to use ships coming to Japan to transport reparations materials to repatriate them, but the Chinese shipping companies insisted that their ships were for cargo transportation and not for passengers, so this plan could not be implemented. Lin Dingping, the head of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Group, told the Central News Agency reporter today that the mission has submitted a request to the domestic government to send a ship here within this year to undertake the repatriation work. He estimates that in addition to the ship's transportation costs, at least 3 billion legal tender will still be needed as living subsidies for this group of repatriated overseas Chinese.

### The Yellow River's Flow Is Abusing Downstream; The Collapse of Jia Village is Severe

Shandong River Defense Department Prepares for Emergency Repairs

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 22nd] According to a telegram from Heze: The flow of the Yellow River is abusing downstream, heading straight from Houji on the north bank to Jia Village and Lei Village on the south bank, and the collapse is severe, which is quite dangerous. It is found that Jia Village belongs to Heze County and is located eight li downstream from the border of Hebei and Shandong.

### Li Zongren Answers Reporters' Questions

(Continued from page one) Mr. Li continued to answer several questions from reporters, with the following main points: (1) Regarding expanding the foundation of the government, he advocated that in the future, whether it is the central government or local governments, they should recruit talents regardless of party affiliation and implement the Three Principles of the People. (2) Regarding his own nomination for the vice-presidential election, it is not yet known whether it will be nominated by the National Assembly delegates or by the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, but he does not mind if he cannot obtain the nomination. (3) Regarding American aid to China, he agreed with MacArthur's view that military aid is more urgently needed than economic aid. As for how much American aid is needed to improve the current situation, he could not give a specific answer. The main thing is still our own self-reliance. (4) It is rumored that Ambassador Stuart supports his candidacy for vice president, but because he has not met with the ambassador recently, he does not know. However, the ambassador and he have a very close personal relationship.

At this point, Mr. Li had to visit his friends in the city, and the reception ended. He then distributed enlarged photographs of himself to the reporters present. At 8:00 PM, local associations and other groups in the city held a banquet at 1105 Linsen Middle Road. Mr. Li is scheduled to hold a banquet at the International Hotel at noon today to thank all sectors of society, and will fly to Nanjing in the afternoon.

Written Statement Mr. Li's written statement on his feelings about the election is as follows: "The National Assembly of this session will soon open in the capital, and the president and vice president will be elected by the assembly. The popularly elected legislators will also convene on their own, and the new government established in accordance with the Constitution will be established at that time. This is truly a new era in the history of our country. However, the effectiveness of constitutional implementation does not lie in the clauses and forms of the Constitution, but in possessing the spirit of constitutionalism. The spirit of constitutionalism is the soul of constitutional government. If we do not have the sincerity to create a truly constitutional government for the country, then all measures will inevitably become a formality, wasting public funds in vain. The National Assembly of this session should make the election of the president and vice president its primary task. President Chiang is widely expected and supported by the entire country, so there is no doubt about his election. As for my motivation for participating in the vice-presidential election, it is based on promoting a democratic atmosphere and a sense of responsibility to both families. Because in the past, the general public was mostly uninterested in politics, and even virtuous and capable people often prided themselves on being aloof and disdained to participate in actual politics. Therefore, political reform was difficult to achieve and also went against the spirit of democratic politics. The purpose of my participation in this election is to promote a democratic atmosphere and encourage everyone to participate in politics with enthusiasm. Personal gains and losses are insignificant. However, if elected, I will use my decades of experience in military and political work to assist the head of state, promote political reform, strengthen military forces, and especially implement economic policies based on the Principle of People's Livelihood to stabilize society and win people's hearts. This is the only way to resolve the national crisis today and has been my consistent proposition for many years. Even if the election fails, I will continue to work for the realization of this proposition. Recently, the international situation has become increasingly critical. At this critical juncture, we must strengthen ties with friendly countries and strive for foreign aid. However, people must help themselves before others will help them. Therefore, we must work hard to govern the country, strive for self-improvement, and only then can we talk about striving for foreign aid."

### The US Will Take Action in the Security Council to Allow Italy to Join the United Nations; Italy Has Become a Political Battlefield Between East and West on the Eve of the Election; Italian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Meet for Three Hours

[This newspaper] London 22nd Broadcast: Rome News, Italian Prime Minister Gasperi met with French Foreign Minister Bidault for three hours today and announced afterwards: [I believe we are moving towards a European Federation].

[Reuters Washington 22nd] Confirmed news, the US government is considering having the US support the handing over of former Italian Somaliland and Eritrea to Italian trusteeship. Two other measures are also under consideration by the US government, one being a suggestion to Greece, in exchange for financial assistance from Western countries, that Greece also give up its claims for compensation from Italy in the event that the Soviet Union and countries within the Soviet sphere of influence give up their claims for compensation from Italy. The other is to promote the Soviet Union to withdraw its veto of Italy's application to join the United Nations in exchange for Western countries not opposing Romania and Bulgaria joining the United Nations.

[Associated Press Rome 22nd] World attention is now focused on the parliamentary elections on April 18th. In other words, Italy has become a major battlefield in the Cold War between American capitalist democracy and Soviet communism. If the Communist Party wins the election, the Soviet Iron Curtain will be pushed to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean.

[United Press Washington 21st] With Italy holding general elections next month, the battle between the US and the Soviet Union for Italian votes may intensify next week. Informed sources said on the 21st that it is expected that the US will take action in the United Nations Security Council after the Western countries announced the return of the Port of Trieste, so that the matter of allowing Italy to join the United Nations will be voted on immediately. The Soviet Union has so far vetoed Italy's participation because the US refuses to allow the former Balkan enemy countries to join the United Nations. If the Soviet Union uses its veto again before the April elections, the Italian Communist Party will suffer a serious blow. The office of Secretary of State Marshall said "no comment" on this rumor. However, no one denies that the US and France may raise the matter again. At the same time, diplomatic experts agree that in modern world history, there has never been such a fierce competition between two major countries caused by an internal election in one country as this time. Therefore, when the Italians vote, they are choosing the US or the Soviet Union. The acuteness of the issue has evolved to such an extent. The US and its Western European allies wrested the initiative in the "Cold War" from the Soviet Union on Saturday and announced their support for the return of the port of Trieste and its hinterland to Italy. In terms of the disposal of Italian colonies, the Soviet Union has already defeated the West. Several weeks ago, the Soviet Union expressed its willingness to support Italy in obtaining trusteeship of its former colonies. France agreed to the Soviet proposal, while the UK did not dare to agree due to its wartime promises to Arab countries. The US still believes that its European Recovery Program is the best trump card. Marshall has warned the Italians twice that if the Communist Party is strong, it will not be able to benefit from the program. The return of the port of Trieste is clearly another card in the current high-stakes poker game, as no one in the three Western countries believes that Italy has a reason to obtain the entire Trieste. It is reported that the Western countries acted quickly this time in order to buy time to prevent similar actions by the Soviet Union, as secret reports from Moscow indicate that the Soviet Union had planned similar tactical compromise solutions.

### Port of Trieste Returns to Italy; Full Text of Declaration by Britain, America, and France; US Asks Security Council to Approve

[US News Service Washington 21st] The US, Britain, and France yesterday proposed that the Free Territory of Trieste, which was created by the Italian Peace Treaty, be returned to Italy. The three governments issued a joint statement requesting the Soviet Union, in its capacity as a signatory to the Italian Peace Treaty, to agree to add a draft treaty to the treaty authorizing the return of this territory. The joint statement stated: The three countries are taking this action because the United Nations Security Council, which was entrusted with selecting the Governor of the Free Territory of Trieste, has failed to complete this selection, and because Yugoslavia has taken "various measures hindering the operation of this decree" in the Trieste region it occupies. A copy of this statement has been submitted to the embassies of Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and Italy here. The statement said that in view of these circumstances, returning Trieste to Italy would be "the best solution to satisfy the democratic aspirations of the people and make it possible for the region to rebuild peace and stability." Shortly after the announcement was made, the US Representative to the United Nations, Austin, submitted this proposal to Secretary-General Lai at the United Nations Headquarters at Lake Success in New York, requesting the Security Council to approve it. The joint proposal of Britain, America, and France to return the port of Trieste to Italy, the original text of the joint declaration issued by the State Department is as follows: The governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France have suggested to the governments of the Soviet Union and Italy that the above-mentioned three governments have agreed on an agreement, advocating that a protocol be attached to the Treaty of Peace with Italy, so that the Free Territory of Trieste will once again be placed under Italian sovereignty. The governments of Britain, America, and France made this decision because discussions in the Security Council have shown that it is impossible to reach an agreement to select a governor, and they have obtained sufficient evidence that Yugoslavia has completely changed its nature and has largely been incorporated into Yugoslavia, and the procedures it has gone through do not respect the wishes of the great powers to grant the region independent and democratic status. When the Council of Foreign Ministers discussed the Italian Peace Treaty, the representatives of the US, Britain, and France insisted on the original position that Trieste, which has a clear majority of Italian population, must continue to be an Italian city. Since the three governments know that it is impossible to realize this decision, they have agreed to establish the city and a small inland area as a free zone. And they hope that the district is placed in such a situation, that through the cooperation of the parties concerned, to ensure the independence of the people of the district (including the city of Italian Trieste). Before the governor took office, the free zone was administered by the commanders of the British and American troops in the north, and by the commanders of the Yugoslav troops in the south. In the British-American zone, the British and American military authorities will appoint the appointed governor and representatives of democratic institutions. At the same time, Yugoslavia, under its supervision in the southern district, took steps to hinder the possibility of implementing the status of the district. Under these circumstances, the three governments have reached a conclusion that the current solution cannot guarantee the maintenance of the basic rights and interests of the people of the Free Territory of Trieste. Therefore, the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France have decided to recommend the return of the sovereignty of the Free Territory of Trieste to Italy, and regard it as the best solution to satisfy the democratic aspirations of the people and make it possible for the region to rebuild peace and stability. Since the Security Council is responsible for the independence and territorial integrity of the Free Territory of Trieste, the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France will submit the joint plan to the Security Council and request it to approve it.

### America to Soon Release Anti-Totalitarian Manifesto, Possible Troop Deployment to Europe

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] The State Department or the White House is about to release a manifesto based on Secretary of State Marshall's proposed plan to support anti-totalitarian resistance movements. One point to be mentioned will be the issue of returning former Italian colonies to Italy. Marshall seems to be concentrating his efforts on assisting Italians who wish to prevent the Communists from winning the general election on April 18th. Truman and Marshall have both made it clear that this strategy will be part of a larger strategy to prevent the Soviet Union from controlling all of Europe. Analyzing Marshall's speeches over the past ten days, four basic principles can be derived: (1) The United States cannot agree to changes in the state of Europe through force or threats, rather than reasonable democratic processes; (2) The United States will automatically cease all economic aid to any government that falls under Communist control; (3) Although the United States recognizes the development of Europe as part of a global struggle between freedom and tyrannical forces, it will currently focus its efforts on Europe; (4) The United States is determined to support its foreign policy with all its resources. The United States will strengthen its military position and provide greater support to free countries resisting oppression. Although there has been no explicit statement regarding the military responsibilities of the United States in Europe, leading American diplomatic journalists have stated that the United States is prepared to deploy troops to Europe if necessary.

### Soviet Radio Commentary: Criticism of Proposal to Return Trieste Intensified Against the United States

[United Press, London, 21st] The Soviet Union today condemned the return of Trieste to Italy as a measure by Western allies, especially the United States, to interfere in the Italian elections. The Moscow Radio broadcast first expressed its opposition to the three countries' revision of the Italian peace treaty, saying that the British, American, and French countries were "plotting behind the Soviet Union's back." However, the broadcast strongly avoided the question of whether the Soviet Union would accept or reject it. The broadcast stated that the proposals of Britain, the United States, and France had not received the heartfelt welcome of the Italian people. The broadcast directly pointed out that the main purpose of the proposals of Britain, the United States, and France was to induce Italian voters to vote for reactionary parties that are agents of the United States, rather than truly considering the interests of the Italian people. After the above commentary, Moscow Radio broadcast a lengthy speech by the leader of the Italian Communist Party in Rome, Togliatti, denouncing Marshall's plan.

### Soviet Union Asks Berlin Control Authority to Stop Allied Control Council Activities, General Clay Says Americans Will Never Leave Berlin

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] The Soviet control authorities in Berlin have notified Allied representatives today that meetings of the Allied Control Council's subcommittees will be postponed indefinitely. This act is tantamount to declaring the cessation of the Allied Control Council's activities.

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] General Clay, Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces, commented on the events in Berlin, saying: "We came to Berlin based on our rights, and we are determined to stay in Berlin. The intentions of the Soviet Union are currently unknown. We must wait a few days to grasp the true meaning of the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the Allied Control Council. If the Soviet Union continues to refuse to participate in the activities of the Four Powers, I do not believe that world history will undergo a very adverse change. The Berlin Allied Control Council has not achieved much in the past year. I do not understand how the Soviet Union's postponement of meetings can be more effective in preventing affairs than participating in meetings. In any case, the Americans will not withdraw from Berlin before the signing of a peace treaty with Germany. We came here by right, and the entire strength of the United States will be our backing."

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] Lieutenant General Robertson, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces, recently issued a written statement to the Germans, instructing them not to believe rumors, pointing out that rumors such as the Soviet Union demanding that the Western Allies withdraw from Berlin within two weeks are only intended to disrupt the Germans' nerves. Lieutenant General Robertson solemnly assured the Germans that, regardless of any propaganda techniques, Berlin will continue to be a city under the joint administration of the Four Powers.

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] The highest authorities here believe that the Soviet Union is preparing official documents to be submitted to the British and American representatives, demanding that Britain and the United States withdraw from Berlin immediately. The documents will likely state that "since the Allied Control Council has indefinitely postponed meetings, British and American representatives no longer need to reside in Berlin." (Editor's note: When rumors of the Soviet Union demanding the withdrawal of the Allied forces from Berlin first emerged a month ago, General Clay, Commander-in-Chief of the US Forces, stated at a press conference, "We have no intention of leaving Berlin. We will continue to stay in Berlin for as long as we deem necessary.") Observers believe that if the Soviet Union continues to implement the policies pursued by Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces, when he withdrew from the Allied Control Council meetings, a new and dangerous crisis will occur in Anglo-American-Soviet relations.

### Finnish Delegation Arrives in Soviet Capital, Both Sides May Conclude Military Alliance

[Reuters, Moscow, 22nd] The Finnish delegation that came to the Soviet Union to negotiate a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance arrived in Moscow on the 22nd. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky personally welcomed them at the station.

[United Press, Moscow, 21st] Observers here on the night of the 21st believed that there was little doubt that the Finnish delegation, which arrived in Moscow on the 22nd, would conclude a military assistance pact proposed by Premier Stalin. These observers include several people who have close ties to the Finnish government. The notification they received from the Finnish government before departing on the night of the 20th indicated that the Finnish negotiators had been ordered to sign a treaty identical to those recently signed by the Soviet Union with Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria. It is understood that the delegation was only ordered to request clarification of the content and explanation of the meaning of certain clauses before signing the treaty. However, they believe that this will not become a serious obstacle. Finnish President Paasikivi and Prime Minister Pekkala did not attend the negotiations due to poor health. It is expected that the negotiations on the 21st will not involve serious discussions. The Finnish representatives are expected to stay here for a week.

### Czechoslovakia Willing to Sign Tariff Agreement with the United States, US Government Reviewing Implications of This Move

[US Information Service, Washington, 22nd] In light of recent developments in Czechoslovakia, the United States is currently reviewing the "implications and responsibilities" of Czechoslovakia's willingness to sign a tariff and trade agreement with the US government. The State Department announced earlier last week that Czechoslovakia had notified the United States that it was willing to sign the agreement negotiated by 23 countries in Geneva last October. The United States has already signed this agreement with several other countries. In another statement issued by the State Department yesterday, it was stated: "The Czech government has notified this government that it intends to sign the Protocol on Provisional Application of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on March 20, 1948, so that the agreement will provisionally come into effect on April 20, 1948." "The United States is currently reviewing the implications and responsibilities of this agreement in light of recent developments in Czechoslovakia."

### Regarding the Issue of Returning Trieste to Italy, Yugoslavia Lodges Strong Protest, Blaming Britain, the United States, and France for Not Consulting Yugoslav Public Opinion in Advance

[Reuters, Belgrade, 22nd] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Simic recently presented notes to the British, American, and French ambassadors in Belgrade, expressing the strongest protest against the manner in which the governments of Britain, the United States, and France proposed to amend the part of the Italian peace treaty concerning Trieste.

The notes stated: "The Yugoslav government solemnly protests the fact that the governments of Britain, the United States, and France deem it necessary to seek the consent of Italy, but do not deem it necessary to obtain the consent of Yugoslavia, the most concerned allied country. Due to this manner, it can be presumed that the purpose of the proposals put forward by Britain, the United States, and France is not to seek the best solution to the Trieste issue and to revive the people of Southern Europe, but to have a propaganda effect and does not contribute to the consolidation of peace. Under these circumstances, the Yugoslav government cannot accept the completeness of this proposal."

[French News Agency, Washington, 21st] People close to the Soviet and Yugoslav authorities here stated that if the Italian Communist Party can win in the upcoming elections, the Yugoslav government would be willing to return Trieste to Italy. The Communist Party has made similar statements in its election speeches, stating that if the Communist Party can occupy a dominant position in parliament, Marshal Tito would be willing to return Trieste.

### Unified Foreign Aid Bill of 6.2 Billion Dollars, US House of Representatives Begins Debate, House and Senate Differ on Foreign Aid

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The Republicans in the US House of Representatives disregarded the protests of the Senate leaders on the 22nd and independently promoted their all-encompassing foreign aid bill of $6.25 billion. Congressman Vorys listened to opinions at the House Rules Committee. Several committee members opposed the bill, but there is no doubt that it will be submitted to the House for debate starting on the 23rd. Senior House Republicans are confident that the House will pass the bill in its original form and it will become law. However, Senate leaders stand firm and will oppose the military part of it. The Senate's plan is to handle the government's foreign aid requests one by one.

[United Press, Washington, 21st] House Republican leaders are confident that the House can pass the unified foreign aid bill of $6.25 billion without modification. However, Senate leaders continue to insist on opposing the combination of military aid to Greece, Turkey, and China with the European recovery plan. The foreign aid plan passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee includes: (1) $5.3 billion for European recovery; (2) $570 million for economic and military aid to China; (3) $275 million for military aid to Greece and Turkey; (4) $60 million for the International Children's Welfare Fund. This bill will be discussed in the House on the 22nd. House Republican leaders have allowed efforts to be made to pass the bill before April 1st, but because it is of a unified nature, it will still cause disputes with the Senate. Senate leaders hope that the two houses can reach an agreement before April 10th, eight days before the Italian election.

### Turko-Bulgarian Relations Turn Sour, Both Sides Expel Military Attaches

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 21st] Official news, Turkey. Because Bulgaria requested that Turkey withdraw its civilian official stationed in Sofia, it has expelled the Bulgarian military attaché stationed in Turkey and his entire staff. Sofia has officially announced that the Turkish military attaché stationed there is no longer welcome because his activities are detrimental to Bulgaria's security. The Turkish military attaché left the Bulgarian capital on the 18th, so Turkey has also requested that the Bulgarian military attaché immediately withdraw from the Turkish capital. The Bulgarian military attaché stationed in Turkey left Ankara last night.

### Czechoslovakia Once Requested to Purchase American Aircraft, Has Been Rejected by the United States

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Senior government officials here revealed on the 22nd that Czechoslovakia had attempted to order four-engine jumbo transport planes from the United States, presumably for flights across the Atlantic to Europe, both before and after the Communist coup, but was unsuccessful. American aircraft manufacturers have no indication of selling this type of aircraft, and the government opposes exporting aircraft or parts to countries within the Soviet bloc. Informed sources said: "For months, the United States has been constantly reviewing exports to the Soviet Union and its satellite countries to see if they contribute to their war potential. Transport planes can be included in the above item." There is also a strong indication here that the United States may refuse to implement the tariff and trade agreement signed by 23 countries in Geneva last October with Czechoslovakia. Since the Communist coup, the United States has abandoned plans to negotiate a friendly commercial navigation treaty with Czechoslovakia.

### Taylor Asks US President to Immediately Dismiss Forrestal

[United Press, Washington, 21st] US Senator Taylor on the night of the 21st requested that President Truman dismiss Secretary of Defense Forrestal, who opposed the partition of Palestine in order to protect American oil interests in Arab countries. At the same time, Senator Lodge accused third-party presidential candidate Wallace of advocating a policy of appeasement towards the Soviet Union, causing division across the United States. Taylor, formerly a Democrat and now the third-party vice-presidential candidate, stated in a letter to President Truman that Forrestal is now taking the offensive, attempting to tailor American diplomatic and military policies solely for the benefit of American oil imperialism. The Department of Defense stated that Forrestal would not express any opinion on this until President Truman received the letter.

### US Senator Advocates Building Strong Air Force

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Senator Brewster, Chairman of the Joint Aviation Authority of the US Congress, stated on the 22nd that the agency hopes that the United States can have an air force that the Soviet Union is in awe of, and at the same time, he believes that there is a danger of war occurring. He also said: "But we are not prepared to say that we will not fight. I believe that the only things that the Soviet Union is in awe of are the air force and the power of the atomic bomb."

A spokesperson for the Greek embassy declared that this news is not worth our denial, as everyone knows that Greece does not have chemical weapons manufacturing plants. The spokesperson also strongly stated that Americans have no reason to be attacked, as they have not used chemical weapons either. The spokesperson concluded that the guerrilla broadcast is a propaganda campaign based on fabricated news.

[United Press, Athens, 22nd] According to press reports, the Greek government army has surrounded 8,000 guerrillas. The guerrillas are planning to escape from the Bira Snow Mountain area. The Greek government air force is strafing and bombing the guerrillas. 160 guerrillas were killed and 150 were captured. In other news, a United Nations Balkan Committee observer team was attacked by guerrilla machine guns and mortars near the Gasteno border near Baguna. There were no casualties in the team. After returning to Chenna, the team returned to the border to investigate reports of trucks from Albania carrying military supplies to the Greek guerrillas.

### Allegation of Greek Government Forces Using Poison Gas, Greek Authorities Have Denied It, 8,000 Greek Guerrillas Surrounded

[Reuters, Belgrade, 21st] Radio Free Greece broadcast that Greek government forces used poison gas against guerrillas in the Nestorji area on March 15th.

[French News Agency, Paris, 22nd] The Greek Embassy in Paris categorically denied the broadcast by Radio Free Greece that the Greek government forces used poison gas in the Kastoria and Nisdori areas on March 15th.

### Marshall Attends Senate Military Affairs Committee, Presents US Military Plans, Taft Agrees to Reinstate Conscription

[French News Agency, Washington, 22nd] Secretary of State Marshall returned here on the night of the 21st from Los Angeles and attended the Senate Military Affairs Committee on the afternoon of the 22nd to present his views on the international situation and US military plans.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st United Press] Marshall stated tonight: "I have made as frank a statement as possible in Congress." When he returned here from the West Coast, he stated to reporters: "The current situation in Europe is very similar to the situation before the Nazi regime moved towards war with Poland." Marshall also stated that the three powers' proposal to return Trieste to Italy was unanimously decided by the United States, Britain, and France, and this decision was reached before he left Washington for the West Coast last week. Marshall's statement that he has reported to Congress as fully as possible on US policy towards the Soviet Union is a rejection of members demanding fuller information.

[Reuters, Springfield, Ohio, 21st] Senator Taft, commenting on President Truman's recommendation to reinstate conscription, stated that conscription cannot be avoided if there is no other way to obtain the manpower needed for national defense.

### Demolition of Remaining Japanese Warships Nears Completion

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] The Allied Headquarters announced today that the work of demolishing 750,000 tons of Japanese naval vessels remaining after the war is now nearing completion. Most of these vessels were battleships, aircraft carriers, and cruisers. One escort carrier has not yet been demolished, and the demolition of submarines has already been completed. A total of 600,000 tons of vessels have been demolished, and 174,000 tons of scrap steel and other metal pieces have been obtained after demolition for non-war use.

### Takao Saito Demands Dissolution of Parliament, Japanese Political Situation Unstable, Ashida Declares Cabinet Formed According to Constitution

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] Ashida told the parliament this morning that the government has no intention of dissolving the parliament. The dissolution of the parliament was requested by Takao Saito of the Democratic Liberal Party, who condemned Ashida's cabinet in a straightforward manner for violating the constitution and being a false cabinet based on false delegation. Ashida replied that his cabinet was formed in strict accordance with the constitution. According to the new constitution, there should be a majority or the most votes in parliament supporting the government, and the government he leads has the most votes. Although Ashida announced the government's determination to maintain the current parliament, he also said that if public opinion clearly opposes this cabinet, the three parliaments should be dissolved.

### Large Quantities of Japanese Cotton Textiles Stockpiled, No Sales

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] According to senior officials of the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the current lack of US dollars in the sterling area and the limited trading market have caused a large accumulation of Japanese cotton textiles after the war. Since August last year, the cloth stored by Japanese textile trading companies has reached 11 million yards. The government official expressed his fear that unless the Japanese government takes steps in the near future to distribute this inventory, this large amount of cotton textiles may rot and be unable to be sold. In view of the lack of US dollars in the sterling area, the official specifically suggested that the government use this batch of surplus cotton textiles as barter to exchange for raw materials from the sterling area, instead of insisting that they purchase goods with US dollars. At the same time, Vice Minister of Commerce and Industry Kiyota Fumin hinted that a portion of this accumulated cotton textile may be used as domestic consumer goods to alleviate Japan's severe shortage of clothing. He also pointed out that 70% of the cotton textiles produced in the country must be withdrawn abroad in order to earn US dollars to purchase the various raw materials needed.

### US Government in South Korea Implements Land Reform

[Reuters, Seoul, 22nd] The commander of the US military government in South Korea, Dean, today signed an order with the South Korean administrative chief, Ahn Chi-hong (transliteration), establishing the National Land Bureau to sell farmland owned by the Japanese to Korean tenant farmers. Fifteen percent of the best farmland owned by the new Korean company will be transferred to the Land Bureau. The land price will be estimated at three times the value of the annual harvest. Buyers can pay off the land price within ten or fifteen years. The purpose of this move is to distribute the farmland of large landlords to owner-farmers, and also to make South Korea have a more attractive land reform plan than North Korea.

### American Far East Broadcast Suddenly Interfered With, US Asks Soviet Union to Take Remedial Action

[US Information Service, Washington, 21st] State Department spokesman McDermott told reporters yesterday that the State Department has instructed Ambassador Smith in the Soviet Union to request the Soviet Union to take "effective remedial action" against the interference with the Far East broadcast of "Voice of America". According to reports from Manila, American broadcasts relayed from there have been "blurred" in recent weeks, possibly due to the influence of atmospheric radio transmitters.

### Pan-American Conference to Open at End of This Month, Marshall Will Attend in Person

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] With the increasing tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, responsible authorities even said that they dare not predict how the crisis will end. The Pan-American Conference is scheduled to be held in the capital of Colombia at the end of this month, lasting for six weeks.

### US Economic Survey Mission Holds Meeting, Considers Revising Compensation Claims Against Japan

[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] Senior US economic experts held their first meeting with officials of the Allied occupation authorities on the 22nd. At this meeting, MacArthur's views on Japanese compensation were conveyed to the economic survey mission. Reliable sources told the Associated Press that Assistant Secretary of the Army Royall and his team held a meeting on the 22nd with representatives of the Allied Headquarters Compensation Department and officials of the Economic and Scientific Department who directly handle Japanese industry. The meeting began at 9:30 in the morning and was still in a closed-door session in the afternoon. It is recalled that MacArthur expressed his support for a more lenient transfer of compensation from Japan. This view has been specifically expressed in the recently published report of the Strack Committee on Japan, which is even more lenient than MacArthur's view. Reliable sources pointed out that, in view of the US Army Department's statement by Royall advocating "Japanese self-sufficiency," the US economic survey mission may stipulate that the 30% temporary compensation decided by the Far Eastern Commission is the final compensation. The source said that if Japan is to become a communist fortress in the Far East supported by gold, no one can better understand the danger of weakening Japanese industry and its economy than the US economic survey mission. It is noted that the Strack Committee came to Japan on the orders of the Army Department. The committee recommended that everything except major industries should not be moved from Japan as compensation. It is reported that the US economic survey mission came to Japan to collect more local data. The mission intends to conduct a "final review" before submitting a change in Japan's compensation policy to the Far Eastern Commission. It is certain that a formal change in the US's compensation policy towards Japan will encounter opposition in the Far Eastern Commission.

### New York Toy Factory Records Record Sales, 800 Exhibitors Make Huge Profits

[Associated Press, New York, 21st] The US toy industry is booming. During the last few days of the annual New York Toy Fair, 800 exhibitors made huge profits. The only concern is that if war breaks out again and the United States begins to restrict the use of war materials, toy merchants will be hit. Fallon, chairman of the Toy Manufacturers Association, said that toy sales this year are better than last year, and the shipments of some factories this year have been fully ordered. Steel toys have the best sales. Lionel Corporation, which manufactures electric toy trains, said that its shipments for 1948 have been sold out, setting a record for sales.

### Comparing the Strengths of the US and the Soviet Union

— Special Translation by This Newspaper's Translation Office

Currently, the Soviet Union is not industrially strong enough to support an offensive war. Even by 1960, the Soviet Union's industrial strength will likely not exceed two-fifths of that of the United States, although it will then be much greater than it is now and far surpass that of the British Empire.

According to materials collected by the British and American governments, the Soviet Union's current strength lies in its large population and its almost impenetrable geographical position. Its future hopes rest on this large population and the abundant resources that can be continuously developed in the coming years. As for the Soviet Union's weaknesses, in addition to the losses it suffered during the war, they are a poor transportation system, relatively low levels of public skills, and agriculture that has consistently failed to meet needs.

A comparison of the Soviet Union's level of development with that of the United States in the past and present provides the clearest understanding.

In overall capacity, the Soviet Union is approximately 45 years behind the United States. In 1940, before the start of the war against Germany, its economic strength was roughly equivalent to that of the United States in 1902. By 1950, at the end of the current Five-Year Plan, its strength is expected to be equivalent to that of the United States in 1904. By 1960, if current trends continue, its economic position will be roughly similar to that of the United States in 1915.

In terms of worker productivity, the Soviet Union will not be able to reach the level of the United States in 1915 by 1960. According to available data, in 1960, the Soviet Union's per capita productivity will be about half that of the United States in 1915.

In terms of railway length, the Soviet Union is far behind the United States. In 1940, its railway length was approximately equal to that of the United States in 1872, or 57,323 miles. Currently, the United States has more than 226,000 miles of railway.

The Soviet Union's development from 1928, when it began to emphasize industrial construction, to 1940, is quite similar to the industrial growth that occurred in the United States after the Civil War. Before 1940, the speed of industrial progress in the Soviet Union was approximately one and a quarter times the speed of industrial progress in the United States before 1902. However, whether it can maintain the same rate of industrial growth as the United States in the future remains to be seen.

A major setback to the Soviet Union's industrial plan was caused by the war. During this war, it lost 58 percent of its vehicles, 45 percent of its steel production, 44 percent of its electricity, and 58 percent of its coal production. In addition, it lost a quarter of its livestock and millions of homes, farm buildings, churches, schools, bridges, and various commercial buildings. Its economic strength fell from 42 percent of that of the United States to only 25 percent. A major goal of the current Five-Year Plan is to make up for wartime losses and restore the stockpiles of materials and food. This explains why the Soviet Union is expected to reach only the level of the United States in 1904 by 1950. (Translated from "World Report" Weekly)

### Recommendation for UN Trusteeship of the Holy Land: Countries Await US Clarification of Measures; Security Council Scheduled to Hold Debate Tomorrow

[United States Information Service, Lake Success, 21st] The United Nations Security Council will resume discussion of the Palestine issue on Wednesday, debating the United States' proposal for temporary UN trusteeship over Palestine.

[United Press, Lake Success, 21st] Small countries in the United Nations may not immediately support the United States' new plan for trusteeship over Palestine, and will wait for the US authorities to clearly indicate that they have a plan to implement it. It is said that more than ten small countries want to obtain the approval of the major powers first. Last November, these countries voted in favor of the partition plan, because at that time the United States insisted that partition was the only way to resolve the Palestine dispute. According to informed sources in the United Nations, if the small countries are to support the United States' new plan, the State Department must first clearly explain how the trusteeship plan under construction can be implemented. The Jewish people have vowed to oppose the new plan with all their might. The Arab people have welcomed the United States' abandonment of the partition plan, but they are also skeptical of the trusteeship plan. Some in the United Nations believe that the implementation of the trusteeship plan is as difficult as implementing the partition plan, or even more so.

Currently, after the United States announced its new proposal in Austin, the Soviet Union is the only major power insisting that the partition plan should be implemented.

### Approved by the Municipal Council Upon Proposal by the Public Works Bureau: Decision to Build a Tunnel for the Cross-River Project; Location Selected Along the Riverfront on Zhongzheng East Road; Land in Two Districts Reserved for Expropriation to Prevent Rapid Increase in Land Prices

[Report from this Newspaper] In order to promote the prosperity of Shanghai, the municipal government has designed a cross-river project, planning to develop Pudong in order to alleviate congestion in the city. A Cross-River Project Committee was established last spring to conduct in-depth research, which found that the main options for crossing the river were a viaduct, a low-level movable bridge, and a tunnel. However, a decision on the most rational method had not been made for a year. According to information obtained by this reporter yesterday from relevant sources, the Cross-River Project Committee recently decided that building a tunnel is the most appropriate method for the cross-river project, and the Public Works Bureau submitted it to the municipal government's municipal council last week, where it was approved in principle. The location of the cross-river tunnel has been decided to be on the Huangpu River bank on Zhongzheng East Road. To avoid congestion at the entrances and exits, the tunnel will have two entrances on the Puxi side: one on Zhongzheng East Road and one on Zhongshan East Road (the Bund).

### Source of Project Funding

After detailed discussions by the relevant authorities, it is believed that it would be more reasonable to obtain the construction funds for this project from the increased land value tax revenue and the collection of tolls. If the tunnel location is decided immediately, the Pudong land will be reorganized and replanned at the same time, which can both achieve the effect of development and solve a portion of the funding source. In order to prevent rapid increases in land prices and hinder the progress of land reorganization, it is proposed to request, in accordance with the provisions of the Land Law, that approximately 30 square kilometers of land in the Yangjing and Tangqiao districts of Pudong be first announced by the municipal government as reserved for expropriation, to prevent transfer.

It is also confirmed that when the former American public works experts Dr. Conway and Dr. Hall visited Shanghai to investigate, Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang discussed the issue of borrowing funds for the cross-river project with them, and they indicated that it could be discussed. If the funding problem is resolved, this great project, unprecedented in Shanghai's history, can be expected to be built smoothly.

Reasons for Building a Tunnel

The following is an excerpt from the Cross-River Project Committee's resolution on why building a tunnel is the most appropriate method for the cross-river project: A. Regarding national defense: (1) Avoid air raids and reduce threats. (2) Unrestricted navigation for warships. B. Regarding port development: (1) Bridges restrict port development. (2) Preserve the Shanghai-Zhapu-Hangzhou Bay port plan. C. Regarding water transportation: (1) Movable bridges narrow the waterway. (2) Bridge opening times must coincide with tides. (3) Bridge piers obstruct tides. D. Regarding land transportation: (1) Long approach bridges detract from the city's appearance. (2) Movable bridges have limited capacity. (3) Bridge opening times cause traffic congestion. E. Regarding engineering facilities: Bridge pier foundations are prone to subsidence. F. Regarding construction costs: In terms of construction costs, movable bridges are the cheapest, followed by tunnels, and then viaducts. In terms of capacity, viaducts have the highest capacity, followed by tunnels, and then movable bridges. Therefore, although movable bridges have the lowest construction costs, they have the smallest capacity, while viaducts have the highest capacity but the highest construction costs. Therefore, tunnels are more suitable.

### High Prosecutor's Office to Conclude Investigation of Traitor Cases in the Short Term

The High Prosecutor's Office yesterday received a national government gazette reprinting a national government order stating that reports of traitor cases would be closed from January 1, 1947. It has been found that in recent years, there have been many cases of people filing lawsuits under false pretenses, causing many abuses. In the future, cases that have not been investigated by a prosecutor will not be accepted, unless they are filed by the victims themselves. Cases that are under investigation or on trial should also be handled expeditiously in accordance with various laws and regulations, based on definitive evidence, in order to bring them to a close. After receiving this gazette, the office has separately instructed all prosecutors to comply. It is reported that the investigation of traitor cases in this city can be completed in the short term.

Han Shuzhi, a judge, has been appointed to fill the vacancy of chief clerk.

### Social Bureau to Shorten the Term of the Sugar Price Evaluation Council; Abuse Can Be Eliminated When the Ration Price Approaches the Market Price

[Report from this Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Bureau and Chairman of the Municipal Price Evaluation Council, again gave a speech yesterday on the issue of external accusations of corruption in the distribution of sugar by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, explaining the following points:

(1) Regarding the sugar price review issue: In accordance with the provisions of the "Measures for Implementing Price Evaluation," the city has organized a Price Evaluation Committee, under which there is a Sugar Group. The Sugar Group consists of one representative each from the Social Bureau, the Municipal Council, the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the Sugar Business Association, and the South Goods Business Association, and the Civil Affairs Bureau is invited to send a representative to participate. The Sugar Group holds a review meeting every two weeks to specifically review the allocation prices and wholesale prices of Taiwan Sugar. All pricing standards take into account not only the cost of production and the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar, but also the local market price and other commodity prices. Recently, general commodity prices have fluctuated too drastically, and sugar prices are no exception. Therefore, it seems that holding the Sugar Group review meeting every two weeks is too infrequent, because there are many changes in two weeks. Merchants often take advantage of the opportunity of fixed sugar prices to compete to buy, resulting in a gap between the evaluated price and the market price that is too large. In the future, the Sugar Group review meeting will be shortened to once a week, depending on the development of the situation, to prevent the occurrence of the aforementioned situation.

(2) Regarding the registration of sugar merchants: The Social Bureau, in view of the fact that allocated materials are often contested by general merchants and civilians, has drafted "Guidelines for Preventing Merchants and Civilians from Speculating and Profiteering," which has been submitted to the 99th Municipal Council meeting for approval and implementation. Only sugar merchants who have been in business for more than two years and have obtained proof from two fellow merchants and the association are allowed to register. After registration, they must apply to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation for allocation, and only after investigation and review can they obtain the allocation. The aforementioned measures apply not only to sugar allocation, but also to the allocation of yarn, cloth, and coal. In order to prevent profiteers from infiltrating, the Social Bureau will not only make every effort to manage registration, but also cooperate with relevant agencies to strictly crack down on them.

Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration Division of the Social Bureau, told reporters that regarding the accusation of falsely established firms, if citizens report them, the authorities are prepared to conduct spot checks. The authorities also believe that the reason why sugar merchants compete to set up commercial firms to obtain sugar allocation is because the allocation price is too far from the market price. Therefore, they are considering raising the allocation price so that it is not much different from the market price. If merchants see no profit to be made, the situation of abuse can be eliminated.

### A Sugar Merchant on Guangdong Road Has Suspicious Sugar Allocation Quantity

[East China News Agency] After the Police Bureau received a tip-off reporting corruption in the distribution of sugar by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the Economic Division of the bureau began an investigation yesterday. It was discovered that He Xing Lu Sugar Merchant, located in Freedom Lane on Guangdong Road, receives a very large quantity of allocated sugar each month, and there is a strong suspicion of collusion and corruption. The bureau has sent personnel to investigate and has taken all of its account books to the bureau for review.

### Witnesses Summoned Yesterday in the Tongji University Student Unrest Case

[Report from this Newspaper] In the case of the Tongji University student unrest, in which Mayor Wu was assaulted, 11 students, including Huang Kelu, have been prosecuted by the District Prosecutor's Office. Judge Hu Zhichao of the District Court held the first public trial on the 15th of this month, but because important witnesses, such as Zhang Jugong, did not appear in court, the hearing was rescheduled. Yesterday, Mayor Wu's adjutant Zhang Jugong, Tongji University's Dean of Students Jiang Hong, Hu Liping, a female student from Xia Guang Middle School, Zhang Lianyun, a police officer from the security police team, and Song Shiyuan were summoned to testify. However, only Zhang appeared in court. According to Zhang's testimony, when the students were assaulting the mayor, he only saw the defendant Qu Yuping at the scene. He could not remember the other people because it had been too long. If he saw them, he might be able to identify them. He could not identify the person who threw stones at the cavalry because there were too many people at the time. As for someone saying that he saw Wang Gongwei assaulting the mayor, that was not true. However, there was a person with a surgical scar on his nose who did assault the mayor. The court ordered Zhang to appear in court again at the next hearing to identify the person. Judge Hu Zhichao, who was handling the case, has been transferred to the Civil Division of the High Court, and the District Court will appoint another judge to handle the case.

### First Meeting of the Human Rights Protection Committee; Scope of Cases to be Handled Determined

[Report from this Newspaper] The Human Rights Protection Committee, which was established by a resolution of the Fifth General Assembly of the Municipal Council, held its first meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Council's offices on Tanggu Road. Chairman Pan presided over the meeting. As a result of the discussions, the following decisions were made: (1) The committee will be named the "Shanghai Municipal Council Human Rights Protection Committee." (2) Senators Tao Baichuan, Li Wenjie, Jiang Pingfan, and Qu Cheng will be assigned to draft the committee's organization and the scope and procedures for handling human rights protection cases. The scope will be limited to the legal framework, with the principle of protecting cases involving personal freedom, because if all the human rights protection clauses stipulated in the Constitution are accepted, the scope will be too large and impossible to handle thoroughly. At the same time, it would not be appropriate for the committee to exceed its legal authority. (3) The case submitted by the families of the dancers, musicians, and other employees detained from the dance halls, and the families of the workers detained in the Shenxin Textile Factory strike case, who have been detained for many days for allegedly destroying the Social Bureau and Shenxin No. 9 Factory, requesting the committee to uphold justice and protect human rights, was proposed for discussion. Resolution: Regarding the long detention of the personnel involved in the two cases, the municipal government should be requested to transfer them to the court for investigation in accordance with the law as soon as possible.

### Conscription Lottery to be Held Today; Propaganda Rally Held at the Queen's Theater Yesterday; Heads of Various Departments Gave Speeches Hoping for Enthusiastic Military Enlistment

[Report from this Newspaper] The city's first conscription lottery will be held at 2:00 PM today at the Municipal Council. The Conscription Association, because this is the first time that the city is implementing conscription by lottery and simultaneously implementing the voluntary military service system, and because the general public may not fully understand the significance of this and the methods involved, held a conscription propaganda rally at the Queen's Theater at 9:00 AM yesterday. More than 2,000 people attended, making it a very grand event.

"Troops Can Be Unused for a Hundred Days, But Must Be Prepared for Every Single Day."

Chairman Fang Zhi gave an opening speech, explaining the tyranny of the communists, who are attempting to control all of China and bring it under the control of the Communist International. Once the communists arrive, our lives and property will be destroyed. He called on all eligible young men in the city to rise up and join the military, defend their local areas, serve the national army, shoulder the responsibility of suppressing the rebellion, and complete the mission of national reconstruction. Fang ended his speech with the resounding call, "Troops can be unused for a hundred days, but must be prepared for every single day. This is true in peacetime, and even more so during the suppression of the rebellion."

"Will Certainly Enthusiastically Enlist, Maintain the Traditional Spirit"

Pan Gongzhan followed with a speech, reporting on the Conscription Association's assistance to the government in carrying out the voluntary military recruitment last year, and gave a brief report on this year's conscription methods: (1) The city will conscript 6,000 people this year. Because the central government knows that the city is a commercial and industrial area, the proportion is smaller than that of other provinces and cities. (2) The previous conscription meeting decided, and the Municipal Council approved, that in addition to implementing regular conscription by lottery in accordance with the law, the voluntary military service method will also be implemented. (3) The 6,000 new recruits conscripted this year are planned to be assigned to the newly established garrison brigade in the city, to be trained locally, and to be used to strengthen the military force protecting Shanghai. This method has been recommended to the central government, but a reply has not yet been received. Shanghai is the largest city in China, paying half of the country's taxes to the national treasury. We have reason to ask the central government to assign these 6,000 new recruits to the garrison brigade to protect the local area. Pan also mentioned that the Shanghai merchant regiment organization at the end of the Qing Dynasty laid the foundation for the success of the Xinhai Revolution, and that the "August 13th" Shanghai War of Resistance made glorious contributions to the country. Now that conscription is for the suppression of the rebellion and national reconstruction, the citizens of Shanghai will certainly enthusiastically enlist to maintain this glorious traditional spirit. Pan finally called on those who have the ability to contribute their efforts, and those who have money should also have a conscience and contribute more money for the special relief donation. The Chinese nation is facing a serious crisis, so this move is a good test for the future of the nation.

"World Crisis is Deepening, Closely Related to Our Own Interests"

Mayor Wu also elaborated on "those with money should contribute money" and "those with ability should contribute their efforts." He pointed out that the world crisis is deepening and the European situation is turbulent. Today's China is not just a struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but is closely related to the interests of the nation. He hopes that those who have the ability will enthusiastically serve in the military, and those who have money must be made to contribute money. The Shanghai Garrison District Commander Zheng Mo and the Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau Zhang Song also gave speeches in succession. Finally, the meeting was adjourned with loud slogans. After the meeting, there were also wonderful entertainment performances, such as the "Sending My Husband to Join the Army" opera by singers Li Jingjie, Li Rong, Liu Ying, and Jing Jing, "Military Music" by Xiao Kuaile, magic by Mo Feixian, and the "Kill the Enemy and Join the Army" drama by the Anti-Rebellion Drama Troupe.

### Unsealing Conscription Tickets

[Report from this Newspaper] After the conscription lottery is held in the city today, the conscription tickets will be unsealed and handed over to the district offices for separate processing. The Civil Affairs Bureau yesterday issued the following instructions to the district offices regarding the unsealing of conscription tickets: (1) After the district offices receive the notice from the Civil Affairs Bureau to collect the tickets, they will send the person in charge to collect them with the receipt. (2) After the conscription tickets are collected, the district offices will immediately convene the precinct chiefs and invite representatives from the Municipal Council, district residents, and district party headquarters to unseal them publicly in the district office, and then distribute them to the precinct chiefs on the spot for collection. (3) The precinct chiefs will immediately bring the collected conscription tickets back and quickly forward them to the selected eligible men or their families for inspection and acceptance, without delay. (4) When the precinct chiefs are forwarding the conscription tickets, if they find that the name on the conscription ticket does not match anyone in the precinct, or if the person had previously registered for removal from the household, had been selected for another service, or had returned to their original home to serve in the military, and the conscription ticket cannot be forwarded, they will report to the district office and forward it to the Civil Affairs Bureau for verification. After verification and confirmation, the original conscription ticket will be cancelled and invalidated, and a replacement will be issued in the order of succession.

### Finance Bureau Decides to Collect Housing Tax Based on Actual Rent Starting This Summer

[Report from this Newspaper] The city's housing tax was originally collected based on the standard of 180 times the rental value in 1937, with a tax rate of 5% for residential households and 10% for commercial households. The Finance Bureau believed that the above standard was no longer in line with the actual situation and proposed it to the municipal council for discussion, and a discretionary adjustment was made. The last general meeting of the Municipal Council discussed and resolved that, starting from March of this year, the housing tax would be changed to be collected based on the actual rent, but the tax rate would remain the same. According to Finance Bureau Director Tian Yongqian, the total number of households in the city is 250,000, and the total amount of housing tax collected last year was 2.7 billion yuan. It is estimated that the amount can be increased by about ten times after collecting based on the actual rent. The new method will be implemented starting this summer. The bureau is currently conducting a survey of the actual rental amount. The survey form has been distributed together with the spring housing tax ticket, asking each household to fill it out truthfully and return it. In order to prevent false reports, a random inspection method will be adopted. If false reports are found, they will be punished. The spring housing tax for this year will still be collected according to the old standard.

### More Silver Shops Approved for Licenses After Review

[Report from this Newspaper] The city's Silver Shop License Review Committee held its fourth meeting yesterday at the Social Bureau. After review, it was decided that Fa Qiangxiang and Lao Baotian Yuji would not be issued licenses because their capital did not meet the requirements, and they would have to be issued after corrections were made. Lao Wanhua's application procedures did not comply with the regulations, and a license will not be issued. Bao Kang had been penalized for a gold and currency case, and will be reviewed again after the penalty decision is made. Zhang Jingyun must renovate the storefront before a license can be issued. Lao Eryun, Lao Tianhexingji, Zhu Tianbao, Yongxing Faji, Lao Qingbaorenji, and Tianbao Xingongji will be reviewed again after the Social Bureau sends personnel to investigate. Lao Yonghe Ji, Baocheng Gongji, and Xiang Taihe Ji are approved for the issuance of licenses. In addition, Lao Yunxiang Gu is approved for a provisional license.

### March Rice Purchase Certificates Expire in Five More Days

[Report from this Newspaper] According to the Public Opinion Survey Committee, as of the 22nd, 3,046,412 people in the city have purchased rice. The validity period of the March rice purchase certificate is until the 27th, which is five days from now.

The Yangshupu Police Sub-bureau sent personnel to retrieve the body from the river. His lower body had already decomposed. The investigation is currently underway.

### Contraband Seized from Jiang River Steamer; Worth Over 300 Million; Three Suspects Interrogated

[Report from this Newspaper] Since Zhang Renyou took office as the chief of the Water Police Sub-bureau, he has ordered his subordinates to strictly investigate and crack down on waterway smuggling. The other day, Xu Pixian and Wang Ruren, inspectors of the sub-bureau's inspection team, led police officers along the river to the Dadawu Pier and the No. 1 Pier on the Huangpu River, where they saw three vessels arriving from Hankou: the Hongda Wheel, the Puan Wheel, and the Hongxiang Wheel, which were unloading cargo. The police officers stepped forward to inspect and seized two large boxes of smuggled Western medicine, penicillin, and forty-eight tins of White Pagoda Oil. The officers then took the shipping agent Zhang Yongliang back to the bureau for questioning. Zhang confessed that he had transported the goods from Hankou via Aohan Road, intending to sell them in Qingdao. He had done this several times before, and they were all profitable. Continuing on to the No. 1 Pier of Dadawu, they seized more than 200 catties of smuggled sea cucumbers transported on the Longan Wheel, and 480 injections of Western medicine transported on the Hongxiang Wheel. The officers also apprehended two guards named Lu Yuande and Li Deyu. They took the smuggled goods and suspects back to the bureau, where they confessed to smuggling. The smuggled goods were transferred to customs for confiscation, and the suspects will be sent to court for interrogation.

### Retired Soldiers Implicated in Smuggling Case; Detained at Military Police Barracks for Review

According to news from the Jianghai Customs, on the 20th of this month, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Peide Wheel, arriving in Shanghai from Guangzhou via Hong Kong, was carrying a large amount of contraband. The Jianghai Customs investigation department had received a tip-off in advance and dispatched officers, together with personnel from the Military Police Headquarters' 9th Regiment and Independent 3rd Battalion, to board and search the vessel upon its arrival. They found eight unclaimed pieces of luggage in the vessel's second hold, containing a large quantity of saccharin and Western medicines. They also found a large quantity of Western medicines and clothing in the luggage of passengers Guan Mengju and Deng Chunliu. The smuggled goods were worth approximately 4 billion yuan. The Jianghai Customs will handle the case in accordance with regulations. The passengers are retired soldiers and have been detained by the Military Police Independent 3rd Battalion for review.

### Representatives from Nine Regions Gathered: The Flour Industry Federation Opens its Second Congress; Amendments to the Constitution and Group Reviews of Proposals

[Our Newspaper's Report] The second National Congress of the Flour Milling Industry Association opened yesterday morning in the grand auditorium of the City Chamber of Commerce. More than sixty representatives from 198 flour mills in nine regions across the country, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shaanxi, Pu (possibly referring to Yunnan), Yunnan, as well as Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Qingdao, Tianjin, Ba (likely Sichuan), and Lan (likely Gansu), attended, along with over a hundred guests. The congress presidium consisted of Du Yuesheng, Yang Guanbei, Li Jishan, Xi Debing, Yuan Guoliang, Hu Mingxin, Fang Gang, Li Wenshan, Han Juchuan, Tian Juyi, Hua Erying, and ten other individuals. Special envoys from the Central Government were present to provide guidance, and Mayor Wu was also invited to attend. The congress chairman, Du Yuesheng, delivered an opening speech, stating that "With the implementation of the Constitution approaching, it is imperative for our industry to strive for its position and resolve difficulties externally, and safeguard our rights and interests. This cannot be achieved by any single factory alone. It requires the collective wisdom and efforts of everyone. Therefore, we have convened this congress, hoping that representatives from various regions will provide as much information as possible about the difficulties and improvement methods of the industry for discussion. We must ensure that the association not only presents a united front in form, but also makes significant contributions in practice, in line with national policies, to fulfill our mission."

Unblocking Sources and Promoting Sales

Following this, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, expressing three hopes: (1) That difficulties in flour sources be addressed by finding new supplies. (2) That prices should avoid a straight upward trend, to avoid stimulating other prices. (3) That those who consume flour are healthier than those who eat rice, and therefore, the sale of flour should be promoted to both increase people's health and expand business. Subsequently, Liu Siying, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, addressed the assembly, stating that there is currently a shortage of flour in the north, and the government is working to resolve it. He hoped that all members of the flour industry would cooperate fully and that the Ministry of Economic Affairs would consider helping if needed.

Continuing the Meeting Tomorrow Morning

Next, Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs, represented by Lu Jingshi, Minister Yu of the Ministry of Food, represented by Liu Xingji, and guest Wu Yuncho, successively delivered speeches. Then, a temporary motion was passed to send a telegram of respect to Chairman Chiang. The first congress was convened at 11:00 AM to revise the constitution and conduct group reviews of proposals. In the afternoon, a reception was hosted by the municipal Party and government organs. At 2:30 PM, the Gu group separately reviewed the proposals. The second congress will be convened tomorrow morning, with a session of three days, ending on the 24th.

### Warehouses Store American Supplies: Covering All Needs from Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation; The Materials Supply Bureau Invited Senators and Others for a Tour Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to clarify the bureau's business and storage and transportation conditions to all sectors, the Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau specially invited city councilors and journalists to visit five units of the bureau's warehouses and storage yards yesterday. Those attending the tour included City Council Speaker Pan, Secretary-General Xiang Changquan, Councilors Tao Baichuan, Chen Baotai, and more than 20 journalists, personally guided by Director Jiang Biao of the bureau. They departed from the bureau at 9:45 AM and concluded the tour at around 4:00 PM.

The types of materials received by the bureau have now increased to as many as nine, among which the post-war surplus materials of the U.S. military in the Pacific Islands and within China transferred by the U.S. government's Foreign Liquidation Commission are the largest, totaling two million tons. Of these, 33% are vehicles, 17% are building materials, 13.5% are aviation equipment, 5% each are communications equipment and industrial equipment, 4% are machinery, 3% are electrical equipment, 5.6% are medical equipment, and other building materials, various tools, transport equipment, and related supplies each account for 1%. Textiles and photographic materials together account for 0.8%, stationery accounts for 0.2%, and other miscellaneous items account for approximately 10%.

Over One Million Tons Arrived in Seventeen Months

The bureau began processing this batch of materials in the autumn of 1946. In the 17 months since then, an estimated 1.3 million tons have been shipped into the country, stored in Shanghai and Qingdao, with Shanghai accounting for 99.5% and Qingdao accounting for 0.5%. In the Mariana Islands, 350,000 tons were received and resold to the Central Bank in November of last year in exchange for foreign currency. It is expected that approximately 300,000 tons can be received from Okinawa soon. Regarding the supply and sale of materials, the bureau follows government regulations and reserves most military, transportation, communications, industrial, mining, vehicle, and health materials and equipment for national defense, transportation, health, and other departments for transfer and use, totaling more than 80% of all shipped materials. The remaining amount is submitted by the bureau for approval for sale.

Materials Piled High, Storage Relatively Complete

Yesterday, the Mitsubishi and Lihe warehouses and the second storage yard on Fuxing Island and the first on Qimei Road were visited. All kinds of materials were seen piled up like mountains. The types of materials almost include the necessities for food, clothing, housing, and transportation, from a small nail or rope to a large car or boat. Most materials are stored relatively completely. Some outer packaging was damaged because it had been stored for many years before being received. Cars, boats and heavy equipment are mostly stored outdoors, inevitably exposed to wind and rain. It is reported that 90% of these materials have been priced and allocated to government agencies. Although withdrawals occur daily, the amount withdrawn is still small due to budget, settlement, urgent needs, customs clearance, transportation, and technical issues, so the amount occupying warehouses is still large.

First Half Budget Revenue of Eleven Trillion

The bureau has mostly adopted methods such as bidding, negotiation, and consignment sales for each sale of materials. The reserve price is determined by the evaluation committee set up by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the City Council, the City Chamber of Commerce, and the bureau. In 1947, the Ministry of Finance listed the bureau's revenue budget as 1.1 trillion national currency units. However, the total value of various materials sold by the bureau reached 1.5 trillion national currency units, plus more than 4 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange, exceeding the original budget by 60%. For the first half of this year, the bureau's revenue budget is listed as a total of 11 trillion units. As of March 14 of this year, the value of various materials sold has reached 5.2 trillion national currency units, plus approximately 1.15 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange. It is expected that it will not be difficult to reach the budget amount.

### Lawsuit Against Elected Legislator: Yan Huiqing Presents a Defense

Issues with Vote Count Should Be a Lawsuit Against Invalidation of the Election; Defendant's Qualifications Meet Requirements and Were Nominated by the Central Government

[Our Newspaper's Report] Veteran diplomat Yan Huiqing was nominated by the Central Government as a candidate for legislator in this city. Although Yan did not actively campaign, he was elected due to popular support. Subsequently, two people, Hao and Hu Jiafeng, raised objections and filed a lawsuit in the High Court, requesting confirmation that Yan's election was invalid. The case was heard yesterday morning by Gao Qimai, Chief Judge of the Civil Division of the High Court, in the Second Civil Court. The defendant, Yan Huiqing, hired lawyer Jiang Pingfan to represent him in court and presented a defense, requesting the court to dismiss the plaintiffs' lawsuit. After the hearing, the court adjourned the case for a later hearing. The defendant's defense yesterday consisted mainly of two points: (1) Regarding the part of the plaintiffs' claim that the vote count was false, regardless of whether it is factual or not, the plaintiffs have not been able to provide any concrete evidence, which makes it difficult to believe. Even if each point is considered, it is purely an accusation of fraud by the election officials. It should fall under the first half of Article 37 of the Legislative Election and Recall Law, which concerns lawsuits for invalidation of the "election," not Article 38 of the same law, which concerns lawsuits for invalidation of "election." According to Interpretation No. 3714 of the Judicial Yuan, lawsuits for invalidation of the election should be filed against the committee members who also serve as chairmen as stipulated in Article 19 of the law. Since the plaintiffs did not file a lawsuit for invalidation of the election against the election officials in accordance with the first half of Article 37 of the law to confirm the existence of fraudulent circumstances, it is impossible to determine that the votes obtained by the defendant are untrue. They directly relied on Article 38 of the law and filed a lawsuit solely against the defendant to confirm that the votes obtained are untrue, which clearly does not distinguish between the types of election lawsuits and is not appropriate. (2) The plaintiffs argued that the defendant, as a member of the Kuomintang, was not nominated to the Central Government through the City Election Guidance Committee and did not comply with the election guidance regulations. He also failed to register as a candidate according to law, which means that he did not meet the qualifications. The investigation found that the defendant is not a member of the Kuomintang. He was directly nominated by the Central Government and handed over to the election headquarters, which then forwarded it to the Shanghai Election Office for registration as a candidate. This is different from the situation where the City Election Committee nominated to the Central Government, and it does not violate the law. The plaintiffs are attacking this fact, which is purely a matter of the procedures for registering a legislative candidate, not a matter of qualification. The so-called qualification of a legislative candidate refers to Article 6 of the Legislative Election and Recall Law, which stipulates that any citizen of the Republic of China who is over the age of twenty-three and does not have any of the following circumstances has the right to be elected. Since the defendant has the qualifications of a person with the right to be elected and has been nominated by the Central Government for registration as a legislative candidate, he is legally entitled to be elected. The plaintiffs are confusing the procedural issues of candidate registration with the issues of qualification, which is clearly wrong.

### Principles Determined for the Issue of Metered Rice Distribution for Workers by the Labor Adjudication Committee

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Labor Adjudication Committee invited the Social Bureau, the Labor Association, the Industrial Association, the General Labor Union, and the City Chamber of Commerce to hold a subcommittee meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss the issue of factory workers receiving metered rice distribution. It was decided that the principles would be implemented in accordance with Article 12 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Temporary Measures for Metered Rice Sales in Shanghai. Detailed measures will be discussed at the Labor-Management Adjudication Committee meeting.

### Wages Calculated According to Last Month's Index Can Be Resolved Individually Through Agreements in Various Industries; Increase in Rations Awaits Suggestion for Central Government Adoption

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Labor-Management Adjudication Committee convened a subcommittee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to study two points in the document submitted by the Industrial Association: (1) To increase the original rations of rice, sugar, oil, and coal for workers and add rations of clothing and fabrics to reduce the cost of living index; (2) To request the government to uniformly stipulate that wages be calculated according to the cost of living index of the previous month to facilitate cost calculation. After exchanging views with representatives from the City Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Labor Association, and the Industrial Association, the Adjudication Committee concluded that the municipal authorities have no right to decide on the first request and will suggest that the Central Government adopt it. The second request, because the prosperity of various industries and factories in this city varies, and the industrial downturn is not only a matter of indexes, the uniform rigid regulations cannot be applied and can be resolved through individual agreements in various industries. Therefore, it was decided to follow the provisions of Article 5 of the Shanghai Wage Adjustment Measures: "If the employer's operating conditions are poor after production and it is truly difficult to bear, the wages may be reduced through agreement between the labor and management awards without following Articles 3 to 5 of these measures. If the agreement cannot be reached, it shall be adjudicated by the Labor-Management Adjudication Committee." The above-mentioned research opinions of the subcommittee still need to be discussed at the current General Assembly of the Labor-Management Adjudication Committee for a final decision.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Enemy and Puppet Housing Residents Association yesterday invited people from all walks of life to the Baxianqiao YMCA, urging the public to speak out for justice and demanding that the authorities protect residency rights.

Five Points Expressed

The Association specifically expressed five points yesterday: (1) The residents do not oppose the bidding method, but the current residents should still have the right to continue residing. (2) The Central Trust Bureau's so-called management and usage fees are not legally based and should be regarded as rent. (3) The property is enemy and puppet, but the residents are not enemy and puppet. The authorities should not value wealth over the people. (4) There are still many enemy properties that have not been bid on. It should not repeatedly bid on the lane houses where poor people live. (5) Bidding will only increase the housing shortage and create refugees. The Association stated that most of the current residents are civil servants who worked diligently for the country during the War of Resistance. After the restoration, they were fortunate to have a place to live. If they are forcibly evicted, they will be homeless. Therefore, they appealed to the government to reconsider and formulate appropriate handling methods to solve the housing problems of tens of thousands of residents.

### Night Visit to Dr. Maurer: Observing the Water Intake Experiment in Lanzhou

[Special Dispatch from Lanzhou by Our Newspaper, 18th] On the night of the 14th, the sky over Lanzhou was shrouded in dark clouds, and the first spring rain began to fall. The drizzling rain, to the farmers of Lanzhou who had long suffered from drought, was no longer seen as something "lubricating," but as if "gold" were falling from the sky. Bare-bottomed children couldn't help but clap their hands and sing: "Old sky, big earth, yellow millet, fifty big..." nursery rhymes.

On this dark night, five kilometers northwest of the city, on the banks of the Yellow River in Xujia, the light of electric lamps pierced through the chilling wind and bitter rain, illuminating a group of people doing

water intake experiments. In the swaying shadows, a foreigner in his fifties, with a kind face and healthy complexion, coupled with his snow-white hair, was deep in thought, writing something on paper, directing workers to do what he wanted them to do, and whispering to two or three people nearby, forgetting that his raincoat was already soaked by the rain—that foreign old man was Dr. Maurer, a sanitary engineering consultant of the Central Ministry of Health. The young people were Sun Runan, the mayor of Lanzhou, and engineers Zhou Zhichang, Xie Bingnan, and Wang Chongyi, the construction section chief. They started working at eight o'clock in the evening and didn't return to the city until twelve o'clock in the dead of night, dragging their weary figures.

The 14th was a Sunday. At nine o'clock in the morning, when everyone was planning how to spend this dreary rainy holiday, Dr. Maurer and Mayor Sun, and others, went to that place again to continue the unfinished experiment from last night and to inspect the progress of other related projects, until five o'clock in the afternoon.

Dr. Maurer was quite satisfied with this water intake experiment. The water intake well was made of reinforced concrete and used the "caisson method" from engineering, using water and the weight of each part to bury it in the soil, so that it was four meters lower than the lowest water level and one meter higher than the highest water level, so that it would be easier to draw water. The reason they worked late into the night was to use the relatively abundant electricity at night to conduct

water level rise and fall tests to calculate the amount of water supplied by the pumped water sample.

The general population of Lanzhou has a vague impression of tap water, and they are indifferent to Maurer's experimental work. It is difficult for them to believe what Dr. Maurer said, "After the completion of the tap water project, it will greatly benefit the health of citizens, and at least the mortality rate can be reduced by more than 10%." But Maurer did not regard this scientific ignorance as an obstacle. He considered it a supreme comfort to be able to serve these ignorant and simple Chinese folks.

Let us look back at Dr. Maurer and

the relationship with the Chinese people as proof. He was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts, USA. After graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he came to China to teach at the Beiyang Institute of Technology in Tianjin. At that time, it was the third year of Xuantong before the Republic of China. He witnessed the昏瞆 of the Manchu Qing imperial family and also welcomed the birth of the Republic of China. Three years later, he returned to the New World and worked in cities such as Chicago and Baltimore. From then on, he had a clear and deep love for China. In the 30th year of the Republic of China, he came to China again to serve on the Yunnan-Burma Railway. In the 34th year, he was again appointed by the Cultural Cooperation 事業 Committee of the US State Department, in the name of the World Health Organization, to serve as a sanitary engineering consultant to our Ministry of Health. The period he stayed in our country, in total, was no more than six or seven years, but he happened to have experienced three new eras in our country, from the overthrow of the Manchu Qing to the War of Resistance, from the 重光 of the homeland to the active quelling of unrest. In these many years of turmoil, he had his own views. He once said to people: "The years of turmoil have not destroyed any of China's construction. On the contrary, China is transforming in the turmoil, and there has been significant progress and development, especially in education. The spirit of service and patriotic enthusiasm of Chinese intellectual youths are admirable. In addition, the women's liberation movement has also made good achievements. I remember when I first came to China, most women were illiterate and dared not go out all day. Even Huang, the president of Beiyang Institute of Technology, with whom I had a very close personal relationship, his wife never met me. And in the process of more than 30 years, China already has female university presidents, female senators, and female reporters..."

Not only does he know one or two thousand Chinese characters, but he can also speak some Chinese with a heavy tone, with a slight Beijing accent. In the past three years, he has contributed to solving the problems of water supply and sewage in various cities in our country, although these contributions have not yet yielded great results. He has been

Nanjing, Chongqing, and Changsha designed a set of sewer and tap water projects. In terms of tap water projects, he has improved the water supply facilities in Nanjing's tap water project, prepared a preliminary plan for Sining, and completed the entire design for Lanzhou and solved various difficult problems after construction started. He is scheduled to go to Xi'an on March 19 to design the tap water project there, and then go to Tianjin to expand the tap water project there. If the World Health Organization ends recently, he will have to say goodbye to China temporarily.

His view on our country's health construction is: "Health construction is difficult to achieve an ideal state because it lacks a sufficient economic foundation. But what is gratifying is that the current Chinese people have begun to understand the importance of health to life. They are not only paying attention to personal hygiene, but also beginning to urge the government to build public health facilities. This is a good sign that a country is moving towards a more ideal step."

According to his plan, the Lanzhou tap water project he designed uses the population of 125,000 in the city center as the standard. If the total cost is 600,000 yuan in silver coins, then the average cost per person is less than five yuan, which is ten times lower than the tap water project in the United States. He said, a

good engineer should not only design an ideal plan, but also base the design on the local economic strength. This is why he tried to keep the design of the Lanzhou tap water project simple.

The fund for Lanzhou tap water is more than 4 billion yuan, which officially started construction on September 1 last year. The purchase of land to build factories, build water, add water meters, hardware rubber, motor pumps and other accessories, has almost been used up (currently there is a balance of more than 574 million yuan). The Gansu Provincial Government approved a loan of 10 billion yuan from the Agricultural Bank, and it is still uncertain whether it can be successful. However, pipe installation and other projects must be completed before the flood season. At present, the most urgent problem to be solved is the water pipes. The 127 tons allocated by the 总行 are still stranded in Shanghai and cannot be shipped. If 63 tons of water pipes are cast by the local machine factory, it will cost at least 2.2 billion yuan, and the tap water project office is unable to bear this cost. Now, according to Dr. Maurer's suggestion, it has been decided to use cement pipes and wooden pipes to replace some of the steel pipes. At the earliest, the entire project can be completed in November this year. At that time, Dr. Maurer will come to Lanzhou again to witness the birth of the baby he has painstakingly nurtured.

### Six Years Ago, the Case of Killing One's Own Child: The Former Teacher Files a Lawsuit: The Jiading District Prosecutor's Office Has Started Investigation

[Special Dispatch from Jiading by Our Newspaper, 20th] The case of Qin Jiefang from Qianmentang killing his younger brother Qin Yishu has been brought to light by Xu Diansheng, the victim's former teacher, who filed a secret report to the district prosecutor's office, causing a sensation in the city. To understand the details of the case, this reporter visited all relevant parties and learned the contents of the secret report. A summary is published as follows:

Qin Zanwen is a prominent family in Qianmentang. He had eight sons. The eldest is Jiefang, and Yishu (milk name Xiaoxing) is the youngest. He studied in the local primary school and then worked in business. Because he was not enterprising, he often stole items from home and sold them for money. He was repeatedly unrepentant, and his parents hated him deeply, and had the idea of killing him. In mid-September of the 31st year of the Republic of China (lunar calendar), Zanwen took advantage of Xiaoxing being at home and tied him up with ropes. Then, he struck him hard on the head with an iron bar, and then killed him with a 山笆. After death, he wrapped him in a quilt and buried him next to the ancestral tomb of the sixth 保 in Zhiting River in the village. For six years, all was peaceful. Xu Diansheng, who is over sixty years old, used to be the head of Qianmen Township and the principal of the township central school. He was dismissed from his post for some reason, and he resented Qin Jiefang, which is why he secretly reported Jiefang for killing his younger brother. Another saying is that the Xiaoxing brothers went out during the occupation and have not returned home since.

On the 3rd of this month, after receiving the secret report, the District Prosecutor's Office ordered the police to arrest Jiefang on the 7th, held a court hearing, and released him on bail pending further investigation. On the 9th, the police were ordered to station at the place where Xiaoxing's body was buried in Zhiting River in Qianmentang. On the 13th, Prosecutor Li Yechu personally went to inspect the scene. There were many people present, including the defendant, the informer, the head of the township 保, the patrol officer from the Waigang Police Station, the local self-defense team, and the public. After questioning by Prosecutor Li, excavation began. At that time, only two small bones were found. Whether they are human bones or other animal bones is still under examination. The entire case is awaiting further investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office.

### Grain Merchants in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province Petition for Exemption from Grain Tax

[Special Dispatch from Wuxi by Our Newspaper, 20th] Grain merchants in various counties of Jiangsu Province went to the province again on the 16th to petition for exemption from the grain business tax. Zhao Zhangji and Zhang Jingwei, representatives of the grain merchants in this county, returned to Wuxi. According to reports, Director Dong of the Finance Office still believes that it is difficult to accept the exemption issue, but he said that the reduction of the tax amount and the method of collection can be discussed in the long term. Zhang, a section chief of the Finance Office, made an informal estimate of the tax amount, estimating that the annual grain business tax for the entire province can be collected more than 300 billion, calculated based on a population of 5 million in the province, with an average daily consumption of two 合 of rice per person, calculated at a tax rate of 1.2%. At that time, Leng, the speaker of the Provincial Temporary Senate, believed that the government should not equate the grain industry with other goods, because the consumption of grain is very small for the rich, and all of it is on the poor, so he also expressed his opposition to this issue. Representatives from various counties will insist on fighting for it.

### Overseas Chinese Leader He Baoren Talks About the Future of the Overseas Chinese Economic Construction Company: Melting Overseas Chinese Capital from All Regions into One Furnace

[Special Dispatch from Fuzhou by Our Newspaper, 18th] On July 12th last year, there was a very grand ceremony held in Xiamen, the city of overseas Chinese. Chairman Liu of Fujian Province, business giants from various parts of South China, and overseas Chinese leaders from various parts of Southeast Asia rushed to participate. That was the founding ceremony of the Overseas Chinese Economic Construction Company hosted by Hu Wenhu. The establishment of the company was hailed as "the first initiative that can accommodate the investment of overseas Chinese capital from all regions and all levels, and can be used to develop construction projects on a large scale" (Chairman Liu's words). Now, the company has been established for almost ten months. The domestic industrial and economic people are happy to know about the investment situation of overseas Chinese businessmen from various regions during this period, and the past and future business of the company.

"This month is the season of spring warmth and flowers in the South, and it is also the season when people who have been steady and steady in industry and commerce are now beginning to gallop across the board. South China, in all aspects of domestic economic construction investment, is still an attractive and fertile place. The situation where various places are planning to develop and concentrate in the north, and large amounts of

capital is starting to move south, as an important part of South China, Fujian will certainly not be ignored. The establishment of the Rong office of China Textile Company, the start of the Fujian exploration team of the 資委會, the planning of a pulp mill by the US businessman Jiangnan Construction Company, the frequent trips of the commissioner of the Central Bank to Rong and Xiamen, and the visits of Luo Yuming, manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Sheng Mujie, commissioner, to Fujian to set up branches... all arouse a lot of interest in the problem of resource development in Fujian Province. Among them, the actions of the Economic Construction Company are the most eye-catching, because after all, the extensibility of the company's capital is too large, and the relationship with the planned and large-scale development undertakings of Fujian Province is too large. He Baoren, the deputy manager of the company, happened to come to Rong from Xiamen during this period to inspect the business. Therefore, the reporter also had an opportunity to get more news about the company's development.

The motivation for the establishment of the Economic Construction Company was originally to melt overseas Chinese capital from all regions into one furnace, with the main purpose of developing the resources of the hometown. Therefore, the shareholders of the company are widely distributed. Hu Wenhu and his son Hu Haoyi are one of the important shareholders. Others include Huang Chaolong, Huang Chaoqun, Chen Bingding, etc. in the Dutch Indies, Chen Zhaoji, Yan Zijun, etc. in Vietnam, Huang Qihua in the Philippines, Li Junxia in Malaya, and Zhong Wenxian, Bai Chenggen, Chen Liushi, Huang Chongji, Lin Shuyan, Wang Zhenxiang, Huang Rushui, Lin Yashuo, Huang Yuyi, He Baoren, etc. in Singapore, Penang, Perak, Bangun, Hong Kong, Xiamen, Shanghai... The reason why they want to adopt this method is nothing more than to grasp and absorb the overseas Chinese capital of each part through their social and economic status in each region, and to engage in more expanded investment plans. However, this plan was affected by the tension in the Dutch Indies and the huge losses of overseas remittances in the Philippines and Borneo. Therefore, the originally planned capital of 20 billion yuan only received 10 billion yuan at the time of establishment.

Handling Three Major Departments: (1) Factory Department, equipped with an iron factory, handling sand casting, nail making, and repairing machinery. The factory is located in Xiamen. (2) Trade Department, equipped with Overseas Chinese Economic Construction Trading Company, handling trade in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Ningbo, Wuxi, and other places. (3) Investment Department, the investors who have invested successively include Fuzhou Economic Construction Public Military Vehicle Company, Xiamen Ferry Company, Gutian Hanshui Hydroelectric Power Company, and at one time, they also invested in Dehua Porcelain Factory and planned to invest in Minbei Native Products Sales Company. Although the business situation during the period was not ideal due to objective circumstances, the profits were still considerable due to the vision of the people involved.

Of course, what is mentioned above is only some of the exploratory activities carried out by the company so far. There is still a lot of room left for its future plans. According to Deputy General Manager He, the current

major undertakings in Fujian Province are transportation, hydropower, and forests. The company is determined to cooperate fully with the provincial authorities to develop them. During the talks with Chairman Liu in Xiamen, he, standing from the government's position, only allowed the company to succeed and not to fail. The company's colleagues expressed great excitement, and therefore, there is also a plan to increase capital by 50 billion yuan. Regarding this, He talked about the preliminary plan for the future as follows:

(1) Establish an Economic Construction Bank: This move failed to be established in the past due to government regulations. However, for the purpose of regulating finance, absorbing overseas remittances, and supporting industrial and mining enterprises, the establishment of the bank seems to be imminent. Therefore, once permission is obtained, it will still be established.

(2) Establish factories: In order to cooperate with the processing of important agricultural products in Fujian Province, the company has decided to build several factories in the near future to strengthen exports and recover profit rights.

(3) Mining coal mines: The company plans to mine coal mines in a certain place in western Fujian, with the time being in the near future. The exact location will not be announced for the time being.

(4) Develop transportation: It will be carried out in coordination with the coal mine mining plan and the route for the sales of local products.

(5) Increase branch organizations: According to the current two companies in Xiamen and Fuzhou and the offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, it has been decided to increase them in the future, especially since a branch company will be set up in Taiwan recently, and then extended to Southeast Asia.

The reporter asked about the recent

factories in the Beijing-Shanghai area generally have plans to move south. Is it possible for the Economic Construction Company to invest and cooperate with them to operate together? He said: This move in Fujian is probably difficult to achieve at present. The main reasons are the power supply and the transportation of raw materials. The former must wait until the successful installation of the Gu Hanshui power plant before it can be solved. The latter must wait until several major trunk lines in the province are completed before it can be considered. In short, He said: "The Economic Construction Company has abundant overseas Chinese capital, but its growth and prosperity depend on the government's effective guarantee. Especially in terms of import and export settlement, raw material procurement, and factory establishment, there are the most places where the government needs to assist. Otherwise, with capital, it is useless in today's era of drastic financial fluctuations. He believes that the shareholders of the Economic Construction Company are all wealthy overseas Chinese leaders in various parts of Southeast Asia. The purpose of running the company is to serve with a higher nature than to make profits, and it is very possible to increase capital.

Deputy Manager He is from Xiamen and is 53 years old this year. He is an old colleague of Hu Wenhu and has been running social relief undertakings in various parts of Malaya, Southeast Asia for 30 years. He stayed in Rong for ten days to inspect the business of the automobile company, etc., and then he had to go to the bay area. (Our reporter Huang Yi Qing)

### Robbery and Kidnapping Case Occurs in Zhengzhou: Zhang Liusuo's Whereabouts Are Unknown

[Special Dispatch from Zhengzhou by Our Newspaper, 17th] A robbery and kidnapping case occurred at No. 18 Hutung Daishu inside Zhengzhou City on the night of the fifteenth. The victim was Zhang Liusuo, deputy manager of Yihe Grocery Store at No. 55 Xidajie, from Mixian, 32 years old. Zhang returned home after guarding the store that night, and a plainclothes bandit holding a box cannon broke in. There were four other accomplices, two on the lookout and two guarding the gate. One of the bandits, wearing a military coat inside and a black overcoat outside, held a lantern and first grabbed Zhang and said: "Someone reported that you are taking drugs, you have committed a crime." Zhang asked him: "Which part?" The bandit pointed the gun at Zhang's chest, and the remaining bandits then overturned cabinets, robbing about 30 million in cash and two gold rings weighing six coins. Before leaving, they also took Zhang away. Zhang's wife reported the situation to Zhang Guodong, a shareholder of the store, at his home at 12 o'clock that night. When the shareholder went to Daishu Hutong, the bandits had already gone far away, so he turned to the store, and learned that several bandits had taken Zhang to the counter and wrote an IOU for 50 million yuan, and said that they would come to collect the money the next afternoon. No one went to collect the money the next day, and Zhang's whereabouts were unknown. This bizarre robbery and kidnapping case urgently needs to be solved to clarify the truth.

### Wuxi Snippets: "Hooligan Home" Family of Three Crushed to Death

[Reported by our Wuxi correspondent on the 21st] Gu Ruizhong, a Xinghua native, unable to bear the Communist bandits' depredations, led his wife, Ms. Qian, and their four-year-old daughter on a dilapidated boat to Wuxi around November last year. They moored near his elder brother Rui Ren's residence by the Tongde Bridge in Ximen, downstream from the Geng Yu Cloth Factory, eking out a living by scavenging. However, the embankment there was of simple construction. Furthermore, due to continuous rain, the stone foundations loosened. This morning at 2:00 AM, the bank suddenly collapsed, and the falling stones mostly landed on Gu's boat, instantly sinking it. The family of three was unable to escape and were crushed to death. At daybreak, his elder brother heard the news and rushed to help, but it was too late. He then met with the chief of the neighborhood, Si Gangzheng, reported the incident to the local court, and requested compensation for funeral expenses. Prosecutor Zhu led officials to examine the bodies. Gu and his wife were still in the same quilt, completely naked, a truly tragic sight. It was confirmed that they had been suffocated to death. Because the corpses' relatives were unwilling to claim them, the chief was instructed to temporarily guard them. The aftermath of the deaths has not yet been resolved. The former vice-president of the puppet Legislative Yuan, 穋逆斌, has a Western-style house in the Xidaoyuan Alley in the southern part of the city, which was previously sealed and confiscated.

### General Liu Kan's Martyrdom: Before and After

[Aviation dispatch from our correspondent in Xi'an on the 18th] Starting from February 22nd, a great battle broke out again in the previously peaceful northwest. The scale of this war and the intensity of the artillery fire were truly unprecedented. General Liu Kan of the National Army used his life and hot blood to write the most heroic page in the history of bandit suppression. Aozijie, with its crisscrossing earthen hills between Yi (chuan) and Luo (chuan), became the "Menglianggu" of the Northwest.

Last month, the Communist bandits in northern Shaanxi held a high-level military conference. According to subsequent rumors, Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, and Zhao Shoushan all personally participated. They decided that starting this spring, they would begin with Yichuan, take the city, then flee westward, cut off the transportation between Yan'an and Xi'an, and communize northern Wei. Then, they would surround the National Army strongholds along the Xianyu line and defeat them one by one. Their ambition was to use the old pocket-shaped areas of the Huanglong Mountains and Malan as bases, making the area north of the Wei River like southern Jin and the area south of the Wei River like western Henan. On February 22nd, the Communist bandits' First, Third, and Second columns sneaked to the outskirts of Yichuan, and fierce fighting broke out. The bandit army launched several fierce attacks, but all were repelled by the National Army within the city. On the 27th, General Liu Kan implemented an encirclement and suppression campaign in Luochuan.

Leading his troops in a pledge, General Liu Kan said to the officers and soldiers under his command: "The bandit army has mobilized 70,000 to 80,000 men this time, intending to cause trouble in northern Shaanxi. As revolutionary soldiers, we must give them a severe blow. For the past ten months or so, we have been very envious of the National Army in central and northeastern China for being able to have a great fight with the bandit army, but we in northern Shaanxi have not been able to find any bandits to fight. This opportunity has come. We must capture Zhu and Mao alive to eliminate future troubles. Whether we succeed or die, this is the battle!" His tone was impassioned and full of righteousness, and the morale was greatly boosted. General Liu also ordered senior cadres to write their wills to show their determination.

After the troops took their oath, they advanced eastward from Luochuan. The mountainous area between Yi and Luo is crisscrossed with mountains and the terrain is very complex. The mountains extend from the northwest to the southeast, and the soil is barren, like other places in northern Shaanxi. Aozijie (thirty li from Yi (chuan)), lies in a ravine between the mountains, hence the name Aozijie. It is a desolate and cold place with only twenty-odd households. The vanguard of the National Army, the Zhou Youzhi and Li Da brigades, encountered the bandit army in that area. At that time, the bandit leader Wang Zhen had just led the Second and Eighth columns, with six brigades numbering about 20,000 men, from the south. After a desperate battle with the bandit army, our army gloriously sacrificed themselves. Most of the bandit army retreated in defeat to the north and south, and a part feigned retreat toward the outskirts of Yichuan. Although the National Army suffered over 10,000 casualties in that battle, the bandit army also suffered over 17,000 to 18,000 deaths under our fierce artillery fire.

Spring in northern Shaanxi is cold. At the end of February, it was still snowing. After the news of the martyrdom of the two brigade commanders, Zhou and Li, was confirmed, General Liu Kan was filled with anger and personally led Yan (Ming) and Wang (Yingzun) in an attack, braving the snow.

The Two Divisions Attack. With the Yan division on the right and the Wang division on the left, their morale was particularly high, and they advanced like a broken bamboo, invincible along the way. On the morning of March 1st, a staff officer under General Liu Kan said to General Liu, "The bandit troops of Wang * were only recently transferred from southern Jin, and their momentum is strong. They are now hiding southeast of Danyang in southwestern Yichuan. We should use our main force to eliminate this group of bandits, and then go north to pursue and suppress Peng's bandit army. Otherwise, advancing between the rainy areas, because of the disparity in numbers, I fear it will be difficult to achieve a complete victory." General Liu said indignantly, "How can Wang Zhen and his bandits be my opponents? I must defeat Peng's bandits to relieve my anger and avenge the defeat of our troops!" So he advanced towards Aozijie. At noon one day, he arrived at the place, built fortifications, and prepared to advance towards the Yichuan county office the next day. That night, they were suddenly attacked by the bandit army. At that time, our fortifications were built with strong defenses on the east and west sides, while the north and south were not the main focus. The bandit army's Wang Zhen's troops came from the south, and Peng Dehuai's troops descended from the northwest along the mountains, surrounding Aozijie in as many as six layers. After a fierce battle for half the night, the bandit army still failed to break into our positions. Then, the artillery of the bandit Bohai Column bombarded intensely, with shells raining down, forming a sea of fire. The surrounding fortifications were almost leveled.

Repeated Attacks and Killings. After that, two of the surrounding hilltops of Aozijie were lost. Division Commander Yan Ming then led his orderlies and cooks to charge towards the hilltops, attacking the enemy positions with hand grenades, until both men and grenades were exhausted. General Yan then used the last hand grenade to kill himself. The bandit army's encirclement tightened further. General Liu Kan saw that all his subordinates had heroically sacrificed themselves and killed himself with a pistol. It was after midnight, the night wind was howling, and the sky was not yet light.

General Liu Kan and his subordinates and soldiers wrote their heroic epic in this way. Although they died, the elite forces of the bandit army in northern Shaanxi and southern Jin also lost their combat effectiveness after the fierce fighting with General Liu. The Communist bandits' "spring dream" of "recovering Yan'an" on March 19th was also completely shattered. As for the whereabouts of Division Commander Wang Yingzun, some say he died in artillery fire, others say he was captured by the bandits. The rumors are currently conflicting.

Life is immortal, and the lives of revolutionary fighters are even more immortal. Their heroic deeds and heroic sacrifices will be written in the history of the war, and their epic will generate even greater fighting spirit! (Our reporter Zhang Xianzhou)

### Zhenjiang Experiences More Than Ten Days of Rain: Spring Wheat Suffers

[Reported by our correspondent in Zhenjiang on the 21st] The continuous rain in Zhenjiang has lasted for more than ten days. Although it has cleared today, it is not yet sunny.

### Ancient Relics of More Than a Thousand Years Ago: Yongling Cultural Relics

[Aviation dispatch from our correspondent in Chengdu on the 18th] In recent decades, an unprecedented event in the archaeological community was the excavation of the tomb of Wang Jian, the former Shu king—Yongling—by the Sichuan Provincial Museum in the 31st year of the Republic (1942). At that time, it indeed caused a stir among archaeologists. However, due to the eight-year War of Resistance and the subsequent suppression of the rebellion, domestic archaeological research on the code of law and cultural relics from more than a thousand years ago could not be sorted out. Recently, in order to stimulate the domestic cultural circles' new understanding of the value of Yongling cultural relics, the Sichuan Museum held a special "Public Exhibition of Yongling Cultural Relics," which is a rare cultural event in Chengdu in recent years.

Ancient Objects on Display: Sculptures, Booklets, and Posthumous Treasures

This exhibition mainly features funerary objects from the tomb after a period of sorting out. The exhibition site is the former imperial city Zhigong Hall, with ancient objects lined up, a dazzling array. There is a stone statue of Wang Jian, about three feet tall, wearing a crown, robe, and belt, with a high nose and wide forehead, intricately sculpted, and with a solemn appearance. There are several iron-cast statues of prime ministers and military generals, two feet five inches tall, with extremely heroic appearances. There are dozens of jade booklets, five-three condolence booklets and posthumous title booklets, each booklet about one foot long and two inches wide, with metal flower patterns on the edges. The upper part is engraved with characters. Although the moss is mottled, it can still be roughly recited. The text was written in the first year of Guangtian (Wang Jian's reign title, corresponding to the fourth year of Liang Zhenming, 918 AD), recording Wang Yan's experience of moving to the land. The booklets are all placed in exquisite iron boxes. The boxes are deep vermilion in color and engraved with double phoenixes and colorful bird patterns. They are exquisitely carved. Outside there is a golden posthumous treasure, which is inscribed with fourteen characters, "Posthumous Treasure of Emperor Gaozu Shenwu Shengwen Xiaode Minghui," which has been weathered. It is said that there is also a gold Buddha and a gold *shi* each, which can be called fine products, which were snatched away by powerful people after the excavation.

Cultural Relics System: Represents Chinese Civilization

The exhibited cultural relics are all ancient objects from more than a thousand years ago. According to research, Wang Jian was the former Shu king of the Five Dynasties. The "History of the Five Dynasties" records: "Zhu Wen, the ancestor of the Liang Dynasty, usurped the throne of the Tang Dynasty by killing Emperor Zhaoxuan in the second year of Tang Tianyou and named the first year of Kai Ping. Wang Jian of Sichuan was proclaimed 'Emperor of Great Shu' in that year and changed his reign title to Wucheng." It also records: "...Until June of the first year of Guangtian," Shu "'Taowu' said: 'In June of the first year of Guangtian, Wang Jian died at the age of seventy-two and was buried in Yongling.'" "Chengdu Wenlei" and Lu Fangweng's poems all indicate that Yongling—Wang Jian's tomb—is in the western suburbs of Chengdu. However, Cao Xuequan's "Records of Famous Places in Sichuan" of the Ming Dynasty pointed out that it was Sima Xiangru's Qin Terrace, which later became a popular scenic spot in Chengdu. In the second year of Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty (1910), it was once excavated by villagers. In the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), the Baocheng Railway Materials Factory excavated an air-raid shelter on the banks of the river, and this tomb was discovered. Subsequently, due to the constraints and opposition of local people, the Sichuan Provincial Antiquities Preservation Association and the museum did not cooperate until the 31st year (1942) to carry out the excavation project. The 33rd year (1944) of the project was announced to be completed, and this exhibition was the first to be held formally.

The Tang Dynasty was the most prosperous period of Chinese civilization. At that time, the country was in turmoil, but Sichuan was uniquely stable and prosperous in the world. Therefore, the Wang (Jian) and Meng (Zhixiang) era of the Former and Later Shu Dynasties was the most prosperous period in Sichuan's history. The cultural and artifact system at that time can indeed represent most of the civilization of the most prosperous era of the Chinese nation. Although this exhibition is small in scale, after visiting it, the reporter believes that it is valuable for the domestic archaeological community to refer to. In today's turbulent times, it is still a major cultural event. (Our reporter Zhou Xueduan)

### Taiwan Education Delegation Arrives in Shanghai Last Night En Route to Beijing
### Fang Zhimou Represents the Ministry of Education to Host Along the Way

[Our report] The group of fifteen educational staff and youth representatives from Taiwan Province who will be visiting Mainland China arrived in Shanghai last night on the Zhongxing ship. The ship docked at the China Merchants Bureau's Pier 1 at 9:15 PM. Fang Zhimou, secretary of the Ministry of Education, Deng Fuche of the Youth Department, Zhu Junti, Lu Guanliu, and representatives of municipal primary and secondary school principals and teachers, numbering several dozen, braved the rain to welcome them at the pier. The head of the delegation is Xu Keshi, Director of the Taiwan Provincial Department of Education. Mr. Xu had already arrived in Shanghai by plane a day earlier and personally went to the dock last night to take care of everything. After the delegation disembarked, the Municipal Education Bureau had originally planned to hold a banquet at the New Life Recreation Club, but due to the late arrival of the ship, the delegation had to take the 11:00 PM express train to Beijing, so it was temporarily canceled.

### Social Affairs Bureau Resumes Rice Distribution Yesterday, Adjusting the Market with Flexible Methods, North and South Market Prices Return to Small Amounts of 50,000 to 100,000

The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, seeing that rice prices have been rising again in recent days and that rice allocation for households in the city is still smooth, but in order to thoroughly clarify the market's profiteering atmosphere and strengthen the supply of food rice, specially resumed selling food rice yesterday. The total amount of early rice was 1135 you, with a matching price of 3.6 million per stone, and 100 stones of Wuxian rice, with a matching price of 3.2 million yuan. In order to quickly ship out of the warehouse, the Shanghai General Warehouse of the Grain Department announced another location for rice distribution, so as to be effective quickly. Due to the continuous rainy weather in recent days, sales were not smooth, and the market arrival was plentiful, reaching 16,073 stones and 5 dou. Therefore, yesterday's rice market was sluggish. Other grains also showed a downward trend. White japonica medium goods were 3.85 million yuan, sheep xiang medium goods were 3.8 million, early rice was 3.7 million, and white yuan was 3.9 million yuan.

It is reported that the People's Mediation Association has a large amount of food rice stored in the warehouse, intending to sell it in the market, but not selling it on a daily basis, but adopting a flexible method, depending on the needs of the market, so as not to affect the source of food rice.

Flour fell with the price of rice. The morning opening was sluggish. The opening price for warship grade was the closing price of last week, which once reached a high of 1.6 million, but eventually fell back to 1.575 million yuan at the close. Lao Che was 1.58 million, and Jiancheng, Red Bee, etc. each fell by 230,000 yuan. Bran fell by 5,000, and wheat was 2.25 million yuan.

Miscellaneous grains were consistently firm, especially corn and red sorghum, which rose sharply under the all-out purchase of the Qing Gang. The former rose sharply by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and the latter rose strongly by 200,000 yuan. Selected Qing goods have been silent for a long time, also causing a surge of 200,000 yuan. Soybeans were stable, but Pinghu Du soybeans rose by 100,000 yuan, and extra-coarse ones were as high as 2.63 million yuan. Sesame seeds were rarely released, and rose by 200,000 yuan. Raw kernels stopped buying, falling by more than 100,000 yuan alone.

Edible oil opened flat, but it immediately turned firm because there were few releases and many additions from the street. Oil mills rarely opened. Soybean oil was all in return transactions, and the closing price rose by 50,000 yuan. Dayou soybean oil knocked on the 8 million yuan mark, and raw oil rose more strongly, because there were not many arrivals. Qingdao Ji barrel raw oil was 9.65 million yuan, up 150,000 yuan. Raw sesame oil and raw rapeseed oil were each 50,000 yuan. Large and small car sesame oil rose sharply by 200,000 yuan. Soybean cakes initially fell and then rose, but eventually remained low by 10,000 yuan.

### Cotton Allocation for Yarn and Cloth Exchange: Yarn Control Committee Drafts Proposal to Maintain Factory Production

[Report from Our Newspaper] Before the official announcement of the detailed rules for cotton yarn substitute spinning, the Yarn Control Committee, in order to enable various factories to maintain production, intends to approve individual applications from factories for the allocation of raw cotton. The allocated raw cotton is intended to be exchanged for yarn and cloth produced by the factories. To this end, the committee specifically passed a proposal at a recent extraordinary committee meeting, detailing the review procedures for yarn factories applying for cotton allocation. The main points are as follows: Draft of simplified rules for yarn factories applying for cotton allocation: Any yarn factory in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui region with more than 3,000 spindles, whose actual inventory of cotton is insufficient for one month's use, may apply to the committee for cotton allocation in exchange for cotton yarn or cotton cloth produced by the factory. After the committee dispatches personnel to verify the situation, the committee will, with reference to the quality and quantity of raw cotton currently held by the committee, allocate cotton to each factory separately, with the quantity of cotton allocated each time limited to one month's usage. Factories that have previously spun government cotton yarn on behalf of the government and have fully complied with regulations and have excellent creditworthiness will be given priority in the allocation of raw cotton as an incentive. Those who do not comply with government regulations or whose procedures for delivering spun yarn are not clear will not be allocated cotton for the time being.

### Public Sentiment Weak: Downstream of Yarn and Cloth

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were due to the excessive surge in prices last week, and the market situation in other ports was reversed, so the merchants were generally watching. Also, it was the time for the Textile Construction Company to open yarn, and the industry's capital was tight, and the public sentiment was weak. Many bulls started to sell, and the market price turned sharply downwards.

42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened at 223 million yuan and fell all the way to 210 million yuan at the close, a sharp drop of 17 million yuan compared to last weekend. 40-count and 32-count yarns each fell by 7 million to 12 million yuan.

Although there was a lot of support for 21-count Double Horse single yarn, it still fell sharply by 16 million yuan due to the fact that those in the industry who were short on funds seized the opportunity to sell at high prices, and it ended at a low price of 120 million yuan. Now Double Horse yarn has also plummeted by 17 million yuan. In addition, 10-count, 16-count, and 20-count coarse yarns all fell back by about 10% to 15%.

Yesterday's brocade cloth market conditions were such that, when the market opened in the morning, there were rumors that the US exchange rate would rise again, and the buying interest was still strong, and all goods were hovering at hard prices. Leading fine cloth once surged to 449 million yuan, but then it was heard that the rumors were false, and the bulls were thinking about risks at high positions. At the same time, the capital was still tight, and they competed to sell. Retail investors followed suit and the merchants stood by and watched. The trend was dull. Seeing the changes in the environment, the major players were unable to support it, so the selling sentiment turned stronger and the asking prices went downstream.

12-pound leading fine cloth fell back to 434 million yuan at the close, a drop of 60,000 yuan compared to the weekend. On Sunday, the off-market price was shouted up to 465 million yuan, so compared to that, it plummeted by about 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and the rest also followed suit and fell. Four Gentlemen and other serges also had more sales and fell by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. In addition, bleaching factories and white unfinished cloth dye factories absorbed them at low prices, and the market was strong. Colored cloth, blue cloth, and Shilin cloth were still strong due to the upcoming sales order, so the market price rose by as much as 400,000 to 500,000 yuan.

Textile Construction Yarn Sales

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday (the 22nd), the China Textile Company followed its usual practice of allocating and selling ten types of cotton yarn, totaling 853 pieces, equivalent to 1458.5 pieces of 20-count yarn. There were a total of 552 purchase orders.

The opening prices of each yarn were: 26-count Heavenly Maiden 105 million yuan, 6-count Deputy Sunlight 60 million yuan, 8-count Sunlight 66 million yuan, 10-count Li Ma 70 million yuan, 32-count Magpie 147 million yuan, 40-count Sunlight 168 million yuan, 40-count TK Color Ball 210 million yuan, 42-count Double Strand Li Ma 198 million yuan, 60-count Sunlight 235 million yuan, 60-count Double Strand Sunlight 346 million yuan.

Spot Cotton Weakens

Yesterday, the trend of spot cotton weakened. Floating sellers poured out goods, and retail investors sold at high prices, and the asking prices were automatically reduced. Later, due to the urgent need for capital, the buyers' willingness to enter the market was weak, and the purchase prices were also suppressed due to the fatigue, and the transactions were stranded, and the transactions were few. Yesterday, the opening price for delivery to the public warehouse was 17.5 million yuan for Tongzhou coarse velvet, 16.1 million yuan for fire-dried underwater cotton, and 3.95 million to 4.08 million yuan for Zhoupu seed cotton.

### Sugar Mostly Flat and Weak

Yesterday, the sugar market was mostly flat and sluggish due to sluggish actual sales. However, spot four-and-a-half white sugar was initially flat and then tight due to shortage. The association's opening price for spot 24 coarse white sugar was 4.8 million to 4.85 million yuan, and four-and-a-half white sugar was initially 5.05 million yuan, and then rose to 100,000 yuan, 150,000 yuan, and 200,000 yuan. Grass-bagged goods also rose from 4.95 million yuan to 5.1 million yuan, a good increase of more than 100,000 yuan. 20 medium-grade white sugar was 4.2 million to 4.25 million yuan to 4.3 million yuan. Taiwan red sugar was 4.3 million yuan. There were fluctuations of more than 100,000 yuan in warehouse receipt transactions. 12th-term coarse white sugar was down 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, four-and-a-half white sugar was down 120,000 yuan, Taiwan red sugar was down 80,000 to 90,000 yuan, and medium-grade white sugar was unchanged. 11th-term coarse white sugar was initially down 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, but then returned to the original price. Local sugar was quoted at 3.05 million yuan, Xinghua white sugar was 4.5 million yuan, and Xing red sugar was 3.2 million to 3.05 million yuan, all unchanged. Diao Qing was the weakest, opening at 2.8 million yuan, down 100,000 yuan. Quanzhou white sugar was 4.2 million yuan, and Hai red sugar was 2.3 million yuan, also down 100,000 yuan. A total of 500 to 600 pieces were traded.

### New Longjing Tea on the Market

Opening Price 500,000 Yuan per Catty

Yesterday, new Longjing tea before the Qingming Festival from the Wenzhou production area was brought in by merchants for reporting. The local industry players are very concerned. The cargo owner thinks that it is the first time to see new tea, and the goods are scarce and expensive. He takes the opportunity to hold up the price and the opening price is surprisingly high, shouting 500,000 yuan per catty. This is almost four to five times stronger than in previous years.

It is found that Hangzhou chrysanthemums have been lively in price and out of the ordinary since the recovery of buying interest from Guangdong merchants. As for the tea market situation, the local and foreign merchants still absorb the domestic sales patterns. At the same time, exporters are still interested in export tea, so the process is still good, but the opening transactions are still few due to the scarcity of goods and the lack of supply.

### Military and Government Agency Funds: All Limited to Deposit in National Banks

[Report from Our Newspaper] It is learned that since the implementation of the measures for the deposit and remittance of public funds of military and government agencies, various national banks have inevitably deposited and remitted public funds of military and government agencies due to practical difficulties. Now, the 359th meeting of the board of directors of the Joint Treasury has resolved that the public funds of military and government agencies should be deposited in the Central Bank uniformly. The public funds currently deposited in various bank branches should be transferred to the Central Bank in full, and all the funds balances that should be transferred to the Central Bank due to the transfer of such deposits, resulting in insufficient cash turnover, can be provided by the Central Bank to various bank branches. As for the funds of state-owned enterprises, they can be deposited by various bank branches in accordance with their professional characteristics, and after consultation with the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank and various bank branches, they should be reported to the Joint Treasury for record and decision, and implemented in stages.

The first phase: Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other six cities will be completed by the end of March. The second phase: all other cities will be completed before April 15. The third phase: all places without a Central Bank but with other national bank branches acting as treasury agents will be limited to transferring the part of the treasury funds deposited in the agent bank branch before the end of April. The transfer procedures should be discussed with the local bank branches, and the bank branches should submit a list of the deposit balances of all military and government agencies on the deadline, and transfer the seals of the depositors to the Central Bank for special deposit custody. The interest will be handled after the decision is made and notified later. After various bank branches transfer the deposits of military and government agencies to the Central Bank, they can be given the same amount of overdraft. From now on, various bank branches must absolutely not accept the public funds of military and government agencies by any means.

### Government-Issued Bonds: National Bank Branches Must Not Mortgage

The Ministry of Finance has recently received requests from all parties that all bonds issued by the government should be allowed to be used as collateral for interbank lending in order to enhance creditworthiness. According to the regulations of the bond issuance ordinance, bonds issued by the government can be freely mortgaged. However, it is inconsistent with the original intention of issuing bonds to mortgage loans from national bank branches. Except for the Class B US Dollar Bonds of 1947, which have been specially authorized to be mortgaged by national bank branches, the rest are not applicable to the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury for restriction.

Our newspaper Guangzhou, 22nd telegram, although the financial market here on the 21st was a holiday, due to psychological effects, the rising trend has increased without end. The Hong Kong dollar once surged to 820, and returned to 774 at the close in the evening. The rest of the gold also reached 2700, and closed at 2550, so the price of rice and other goods was uniformly raised. However, the inquiry was priced without a market, and the market was bleak.

### Domestic Ramie Thread: Monthly Production Falls Short of Demand

Currently, there are five types of ramie thread in this city. British goods have bright colors, are soft and strong. American goods are inferior to British goods in terms of color and texture, and Hong Kong goods are of poorer quality. There are two types of domestic products from Textile Construction and Tianyuan companies. It is heard that the degumming loss of raw ramie per 100 pounds is 30%, and the textile loss is 20%, totaling 50%. It is learned that Hong Kong, Guangdong and other places have recently used domestic goods due to the shortage of British and American goods, resulting in the monthly output of both companies feeling that the supply falls short of demand.

### Money Market Tightens: Chinese Stocks Are Weak and Cannot Be Revived

Chinese stocks were pulled up when the market opened yesterday, but the money market was even more urgent, and the major players had already taken the opportunity to leave the market. No one maintained it, and it became worse and worse, and it was weak and could not be revived. Except for Xinyi, which still had some achievements, it was difficult to cheer up, and the trend was already timid.

When the market opened in the morning, people's hearts were still stable. The US loan was again shelved by the US Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, and there were new developments in the industry, which boosted people's hearts. Yongsha debuted at 1860 yuan and 1998 yuan. After the opening, Xinyi was unusually brisk, and there were rumors of a drop in Hong Kong Electric. Yongsha rose to 1960 yuan and 2055 yuan. Then it fell back to 1930 yuan and 2020 yuan. Some people took advantage of the low price to enter the market, and it rose again to 1950 yuan and 2045 yuan. The tightening of the money market, the embarrassment of the dealers, the unfavorable factors such as the decline in off-market materials, and the near noon step down to 1835 yuan and 1940 yuan.

Foreign stocks were forced by the tight money market yesterday, making it difficult for buyers to move forward. After the securities dealers entered, they exited immediately. In addition, the supply from Guangdong and foreign merchants made the maintenance even more scarce. Steel industry opened at 680,000, shipping industry opened from 275,000, Yisha opened from 2 million, and all were unsustainable and retreated. In the afternoon, Yisha fell to 1.85 million and then stabilized slightly.

### Standards for Textile Products: Ministry of Economic Affairs Will Have Regulations

The Central Bureau of Standards of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in view of the fact that various countries have regulations on the standards of textile industrial products, while our country is extremely chaotic, which is extremely inconvenient in terms of product sales management and export, and the impact on industry and commerce is not small. Therefore, it has recently formulated various standards for textile product sales packaging, such as the standard for serge, what is serge, the raw material weight length and width of the serge fabric, etc. Also, in terms of 12-pound fine cloth, the standard weight is 12 pounds, the length is 40 yards, the width is 36 inches, the warp yarn is 23 count cotton yarn, and the weft yarn is 21 count cotton yarn.

### Grass Green Serge: Both Supply and Demand Are Low in the Market

Grass green wool serge has had low supply and demand in recent days. Because the sale of yellow wool and military wool to Japan has passed, the only ones sold are wattle wool and thin serge, and except for Xuzhou, Anqing, Nanjing, and other merchants, the rest have no interest. The output of various factories is therefore quite lacking, so the grass green and grass yellow colors of the wool serge category are in fact in a difficult situation of forming both difficult to search for and urgently wanting to sell. Yesterday, the old-fashioned double-red-edged grass-green wattle wool was wholesaled for 3.8 million yuan per yard, the new-fashioned original-edged was 3.5 million yuan, Hualun grass-green serge was sold for 2.67 million yuan, and miscellaneous brands were sold for 2.45 million yuan.

### Cigarette Factory Decline

Yesterday's cigarette market was initially stable, but then the Yizhong foreign counterparts came to sell again, and the selling trend was once quite strong, and the price fell.

Until the end, 10 Great British cigarettes closed at a low price of 99 million yuan, a drop of 2 million yuan compared to the weekend. Old Knife cigarettes fell more sharply, closing at 82.5 million yuan, a drop of 4 million yuan. The rest of the Chinese merchants' cigarettes also fell from 40,000 to 5,000 yuan to 135,000 yuan. The market for American canned cigarettes and 50-pack canned cigarettes also tended to be weak.

### Import of Used Machines After Repair Approved Without Import License

In the past, domestic factories had difficulties in exporting machines to foreign countries for repair and then re-importing them. In order to eliminate the difficulties of manufacturers, the Import and Export Management Committee recently passed a motion at its 9th committee meeting that when used machines or their parts are shipped from domestic factories to foreign countries for repair and re-imported, if the customs verifies that they are indeed the original goods, they should be exempted from applying for an import license in order to reduce procedural difficulties.

### The Eve of the Birth of Greek Philosophy

— Yan Qun

Humans are born into a natural environment, and they come into contact with nature. Natural things, such as the sky, the earth, mountains, rivers, wind, rain, thunder, lightning, etc., on the one hand, oppress them in life, and on the other hand, arouse their curiosity. They are startled by oppression and doubtful by curiosity. These two kinds of psychology are the fuse of knowledge.

The ancient Greeks initially solved the problems of surprise and doubt through mythical religion. Their abilities were weak, and they were oppressed and dazzled by the natural world. Unable to do anything about it, they wanted to invite some supernatural gods to resist nature; moreover, lacking exploratory experience, they sought simple means, like performing magic, to solve their problems. Besides, although their psychology of awe and doubt arose simultaneously, due to the pressing needs of life, awe ultimately outweighed doubt; therefore, they needed something powerful enough to subdue the wanton power of the natural world, and their panicked minds could find some comfort in it. This is the reason for the emergence of the mythical religion of ancient Greece.

Their mythical religion was polytheistic and anthropomorphic. What is meant by anthropomorphic? It means believing that gods are like humans: they have the organization of families, societies, and countries, so they also have relationships of rulers and subjects, fathers and sons, husbands and wives, brothers and friends; they have emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, love, hate, and desire, so they also have rewards and punishments. In short, the virtues of humans are all possessed by gods, and the ugliness of humans is also fully present in gods, only that the power of gods far exceeds that of humans, and even everything in nature is created and managed by them. The concept of anthropomorphism was the most common in primitive times, so a Greek philosopher said that if cattle and horses had religions, the God in their minds would definitely be a cow and a horse. This kind of concept certainly comes from a narrow view from the bottom of a well, but it can also reveal another psychology of humans at that time; they were helpless against the oppression of the natural world, and they wished they could bring out another group of people much stronger than themselves, i.e., the gods they imagined, to resist nature. Not only could they resist, but everything in nature was simply created and managed by them. As long as they were properly appeased, the wanton power of nature could be subdued, and they themselves would not have to worry anymore.

However, this kind of religion, although it can comfort the mind of fear for a time, cannot satisfy the heart of curiosity forever. Moreover, anthropomorphic gods, being as base, filthy, and evil as humans, and further endowed with supreme authority, their oppression of human emotions is no less than the unsatisfactory things in nature. So, to resist the wanton power of nature, to exchange it for the wanton power of theocracy, wouldn't that be replacing violence with violence? Thus, the ancient Greeks came to a new realization: to resist the oppression of nature, one cannot seek solutions outside of nature. One must understand nature itself, seek the causes of its oppression within its scope, and then control the cause to govern the effect, so that human power can be effective. This is the view of "human knowledge and power unite" of Bacon later, and it is also the beginning of the spirit of what he called "obeying nature to control nature." Under this new realization of view and spirit, Greek philosophy was born.

The transition from mythical religion to philosophy is a turning point in Western culture, and it has been developing along one path from that time to the present. What is this path? It is reason. Therefore, the birth of Greek philosophy can be regarded as the beginning of Westerners using their reason to do excavation work in the natural world.

### Schopenhauer's Theory of Suicide

— Shao Xiong

Opening the newspaper, one can see news of suicide at any time. Today it is Mr. Zhang's suicide, tomorrow it is Mr. Li's suicide. Suicide seems to be contagious. As long as newspapers exaggerate, sympathize, or even praise it, suicide can increase. In this year of national poverty and frequent turmoil, everyone feels the difficulty of survival, and suicide may be the simplest way to solve life problems. The high number of suicide cases currently is certainly a major reason for this.

Suicide is a social pathology, and in any case, it is certainly not a blessing for society. But is the act of suicide justified? Is suicide a criminal act? In other words, from an ethical or moral standpoint, do we have legitimate reasons to oppose suicide? The 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer has a theory of suicide. This article intends to introduce his theory and then briefly criticize it.

Schopenhauer's theory is contradictory on the surface. On the one hand, he sympathizes with suicide, and on the other hand, he opposes it. From one point of view, he believes that suicide is justified. Suicide is by no means a criminal act. We want to know whether suicide is a criminal act, and our own moral emotions can determine it. When we hear that someone we know has committed murder, theft, or fraud, what are our emotions? And when we hear that someone we know has committed suicide, what are our emotions? Regarding the former event, we will definitely have feelings of moral anger, and we will definitely hate this person very much, and we will definitely demand punishment and revenge. But regarding the latter event, our emotions are different. Our emotions are sorrow and sympathy, mixed with the thought of admiring his courage. Can we say that the latter event is the same as the former event, and both are criminal acts? It can be seen from our moral emotions that suicide is by no means a crime. The fact that suicide is not a crime can also be fully proven from the statements and actions of sages and heroes, both ancient and modern, in China and abroad. In the Bible, whether the Old Testament or the New Testament, there is no explicit prohibition of suicide. Opposing suicide is only the personal opinion and prejudice of religious figures. An ancient Roman writer, Pliny, once said: "Even God is not possible in all events; for if his will is to die, he cannot accomplish his own death, but in all the sufferings of our life in the world, death is the best gift that God has given to mankind." As for the events of the ancients taking suicide as an honor, there are even more unknown. Indians even regard suicide as a religious act. Playwrights' eulogies of suicide are also common both in China and abroad. What reason do we have to oppose suicide? So, if the law prohibits suicide, this is the most ridiculous event. Because what punishment can be added to a person who is not afraid of death? Suicide is a human right. In addition to his own life and body, what else does each person have that is more inviolable?

But from another point of view, Schopenhauer opposes suicide. Schopenhauer's opposition to suicide is not to oppose it as a criminal act, but to oppose it as not a good means of denying life. According to Schopenhauer's philosophy, human life is full of pain and sin. And the source of this life is due to the will, due to the will to live. We want to eliminate human pain and sin, we must deny the will to live. However, to deny the will to live, this is not what suicide can achieve its purpose. Suicide is not a negation of the will to live, on the contrary, this is the most affirmation of the will to live. The negation of the will to live is not constituted by escaping the pain of life, but by escaping happiness. When a suicide destroys his existence as an individual, he does not destroy his will to live. The suicide's will to live is very strong. If he has the ability to satisfy himself, if he can affirm his will to resist the forces of the environment, he also intends to survive. Only because the power of the environment is too strong, he cannot resist it, then he commits suicide. Therefore, the suicide's deep intention is to live rather than to die. Although he destroyed the body. This will to live still exists. Suicide is not the liberation of life, we must go beyond life, we must deny life, we should find other means, and we should not take suicide as a means. This is Schopenhauer's main reason for opposing suicide. Moreover, Schopenhauer believes that suicide is also a clumsy experiment. He said: "Suicide can also be regarded as an experiment, an experiment in which people want to ask nature a question, and force nature to answer it. The question is: What changes will death bring to human existence and human insight into natural things? This is a clumsy experiment, because it eliminates both the person who asks the question and the person who is waiting for the answer."

The above is simply the theory of suicide of this person. Whether he sympathizes with suicide or opposes suicide, his main errors are two: one is to regard life as personal, and the other is to regard life as full of pain and sin. Regarding life as personal, the individual has the right to dispose of it, and suicide is justified. But in fact, life is definitely not just personal. Life must have a source. From the source of life, from the moment we are born, life is not personal, but contains the blood and achievements of parents and ancestors. And in the growth of life, the achievements of society and the nation are even more indispensable factors. Without the assistance of society and the nation, life cannot grow. Therefore, a grown life is by no means unique to the individual, but is shared by the society and the nation. In this way, the individual does not have the freedom to dispose of it, and suicide becomes unjustified. Secondly, regarding life as full of pain and sin, then eliminating pain and sin is naturally justified. However, although life has pain and sin, life is definitely not just pain and sin. To say that life is full of pain and sin, or to say that life is more painful than happy and sin is more than good, this is not a conclusion based on any scientific statistics, but only a personal prejudice, or a conclusion based on the fewest examples. Schopenhauer had such a judgment based on his personal limited observation and neglecting the other side of life. If we look at life from the bright side and expand the scope of our observation, we may come to the opposite conclusion to Schopenhauer's. So we can never regard Schopenhauer's conclusion as absolutely correct, therefore we cannot agree with his theory of suicide. We must know that for those who commit suicide, we can naturally feel sadness and sympathy, but sadness and sympathy are not moral approval. Even a heinous murderer, at the moment of his execution, we can also feel sadness or sympathy, can we regard this emotion as moral approval? Sadness and sympathy are one thing, and moral approval is another, and the two cannot be confused. We can feel sorry for suicides, we can sympathize with suicides, but generally speaking (there are exceptions), we cannot regard the behavior of suicides as justified. This is the author's conclusion.

### Random Talk on Cultural Anecdotes

— One Finger

Today there are common sayings: "spiritual civilization" and "material civilization." These two terms are familiar to the ears of our countrymen, and they know them well, but those who can explain them in detail are rare. However, if asked about the nature of these two and how they relate to the survival of a country or a nation, they often remain at a loss, unable to find their direction. Therefore, more than ten years ago, one or two giants in academic circles had the theory of "complete Westernization."

What is so-called spiritual civilization but the philosophy, science, art, religion, ethics, and politics of a country or a nation? And what is so-called material civilization but the material productions of its people, which are for utilitarianism and improving people's livelihood. The former is that by which a country and a nation survive, and that by which they are distinguished from other countries and other nations; if it falls to the ground, the country and the nation will perish. The latter, including wealth and power, is something that different countries and different nations do not necessarily differ in, and can be borrowed and used. Being inferior in the latter, a country or a nation may be temporarily subjected to other countries or other nations, but will not lead to ultimate disaster; if it is inferior in the former and perishes, it will be a disaster that cannot be reversed for ten thousand eons, and the tragedy of humanity is worse than this.

If spiritual civilization is profound, and material civilization has not yet reached it, then one can peddle to others and reap the benefits of utilitarianism and improving people's livelihood. Spiritual civilization is not like that, it is not so easy to borrow from others. The material civilization of the Japanese, such as Western clothes and leather shoes, can be worn by those with deep eye sockets and high noses, and can also be worn by our descendants of Yan and Huang. To borrow the spiritual civilization of others, first, one cannot completely abandon what one has in common and only seek from others, and second, one cannot take from others without making compromises. The matter lies in carefully measuring one's own shortcomings, picking up others' strengths to make up for them; and what is picked up for compensation must be compatible with what one already has, and not mutually exclusive. For example, if a body is weak and seeks medical treatment, the doctor will never teach him to discard his old body, but will carefully diagnose where his weakness lies and prescribe tonics; however, there are many tonics, and if they are not something that the person's body can tolerate, even if they are administered, it will be useless, and may even be harmful, so one must be careful. Then, it can be seen that the argument of those who advocate complete Westernization is not relevant to reality.

### Everyman's Responsibility on the Issue of Atomic Energy

— Original by Li Lian Tai Er, Translated by Chen Zhuo Ru

The basic goal of the reactor should be understood by the public, because other important knowledge about atomic energy work can be derived from this. If a person understands these three points, he can understand why the money and time spent on manufacturing and improving weapons such as the atomic bomb can directly help the development of industrial power. This has been said more than once or twice. The paths of manufacturing atomic bombs and using the power of the atomic nucleus for construction are 85 percent the same.

Power is naturally the most dazzling application of atomic energy, but it is still impossible now, and it is not possible to turn a corner. In two or three years, we may have an atomic energy power plant for demonstration or experimentation—we can use it to light up lights and tow machines. Some scientists and engineers say that in ten years, we may have a fairly practical and economical atomic power machine. But even so, in ten years, atomic power will still not be cheap.

The third point of the reciprocating machine—that is, the generation of neutrons—the benefits it produces are hard to anticipate even for the most imaginative cartoonists. This reactor may produce substances with properties completely unknown today by bombarding various substances with neutrons. Among these substances, some can enable us to use this reactor as a source of power, and may also be very important for ordinary power machines.

The by-product research of atomic energy development may have remarkable results. For example, part of the atomic energy research work is about [sic] Dai, which has opened up a new world in chemistry, namely Fluorocarbons. Some people say that its future hope can be compared with atomic energy.

Seeking new ways out for young people, seeking new hope for patients, seeking new understanding of science for peaceful undertakings—these are some of the items on the agenda for the present and the near future.

But these things—and some others I could mention—are only a start. The door of knowledge has just been opened a little. No one can predict what changes will come after knowing the details of matter. We must remember that every organism is also made up of atoms, and the atomic energy we are talking about is also in these atoms. We must also remember that all matter, such as the paper on which these words are printed, the chair you are sitting on, the mountains and the sea, are all made up of atoms and atomic nuclei.

Therefore, the study of atomic energy allows us to know the nature of the world in which we live. The important thing is not only to understand how the concrete effects of these basic quantities of knowledge may produce, which is naturally very dazzling, but also to know what important changes these knowledge will bring—these changes are bound to bring.

What we are concerned about is not that change will come. This is what we are used to seeing today. We like change. What we are concerned about is that these changes can be coordinated with our lives, it [sic] does not hinder our personal freedom, we [sic] should take the initiative to control the impact of [sic] this [sic] kind of [sic] Ming on all aspects of society, life, agricultural education, industry and military [sic] degree.

The original science will cause a large group of [sic] new inventions in other aspects: this has already started and will be expanded. But the people should not let these technical developments jump over their party holdings. If so, the democratic ideal is over. In the final analysis, it should be as follows.

(1) We must not relax at all until mankind will not use atomic energy for destructive and private purposes;

(2) (Directly and primarily related) We must strive to encourage the existing inventions of atomic energy, and the new inventions that may come in the future, to be applied to some aspects that are beneficial to the eight categories and in line with humanitarian ideals.

The realistic and difficult problem to solve is: which aromatic surface do we use this ever-increasing new knowledge to?

What is needed to solve this major problem is not the judgment of experts, because this is no longer a scientific matter, but the humanitarian experience and conscience of the prophets and seers in hundreds and thousands of communities in the country. There is no better way to make judgments in these areas than the common sense of an informed public.

There are many reasons why every citizen should know the basic facts of atomic energy. One of the reasons is that we want to know what kind of program can make international control of atomic energy effective. That is, what Secretary of State Marshall said can "eliminate the demons of that destructive war." Or what kind of plan is ineffective, but is: "deceiving the people of the world."

Weakening the security of the country and delaying research on the treatment of cancer, there is nothing more than allowing the ignorant and the politician's organization to become a force to manipulate science and scientists. The most effective way to prevent the harm of those who are ignorant and shallow-minded and selfish in vain is an enlightened public. The people should be careful of their public servants. But the people must know the true facts, then their views will have power.

The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission is legally responsible for providing the public with knowledge of atomic energy. We hope to do our best to fulfill this responsibility. In the current situation, a lot of technical news has to be kept secret and is very well guarded. The Commission naturally has to fulfill its responsibility for guidance in this area, and sometimes it has to provide the public with this new knowledge. But all news about public issues has been opened as much as possible.

If a person wants to know a little more specialized knowledge, he can go to a nearby university to find it. Regarding public issues, universities and middle schools should have people collect and briefly describe the main facts for use by civic groups. Local libraries are naturally also an important source.

I hope that the people of the whole country can understand the facts and concepts of this issue that is closely related to us. I think that one day in the future, everyone will understand Geigen meters, radioactive isotopes, the Baruch plan, Alpha particles, neutron absorption, nuclear reactors, etc., just like engines, X-rays, long and short waves, vitamins, etc. are familiar to everyone today. The knowledge of atomic energy is new, but the new books are also increasing day by day, and there will always be someone writing atomic energy textbooks for universities and middle schools, so that this school will be moved from the laboratory to everyone's common sense.

Only when the people are enthusiastic about this issue and understand its essence, can we avoid disasters and achieve true progress. Only when the people study and are careful, can this force have good results. The power of democracy lies in the conscience and good opportunity of the public.

### Bosanquet on Thought and Freedom

— Zhi Ru

If, according to Bosanquet's intention, thought is regarded as the complete virtue of the healthy movement of the human heart, then it contains all the conscious activities of mankind, and is expressed in "all the experiences of a rational animal, or in every experience." A free act is an act that can receive and release, and is self-aware and autonomous. The mere influence of body on body does not constitute the behavior of a creative person. To be an active agent is to be a free cause, not a natural cause; that is, he must transform himself according to his nature and accumulation, expand himself, break through his present boundaries and be in communication with heaven and earth, and all things are one; turn "all strangers into the closest relatives, and turn things that are seemingly unrelated into things that are fundamentally closely related: in this way, affirming the self in the non-self, or saying that transcending the boundaries of the self and the non-self to reach a self-sufficient self, at this time the self is not a link in the natural order, but a supernatural subject. But to be such a free subject, one obviously cannot allow blind desires to run rampant, but must infiltrate your will into what the Greek philosophers called reason, wisdom, or what Bosanquet called thought, and turn it into what our Confucian scholars called "manifest virtue."

The apparent incompatibility of thought and freedom of will is due to the view of thought as a separate faculty, unrelated to other faculties of the human heart: merely the intellect of abstract reasoning. Under such a separate view, thought is not only incompatible with will and emotion, but also separated from the talents of direct experience, intuition; therefore, the ideal has become a dead thing that cannot understand the Tao above, and cannot feel things below.

However, in Bosanquet's view, the procedures of abstract, speculative judgment and reasoning are not sufficient to exhaust the nature of thought. Deduction is only one aspect of thought. Thought also has an intuitive aspect. "The ultimate intention of thought is not abstract generalization, but to construct a world," that is to say, it not only analyzes but also synthesizes, it not only distinguishes parts, but also recognizes the necessary connection between parts, the spirit of the whole. It is not limited to the givens of sensation, it must clarify the meaning of the givens of sensation and transcend reality: from near to far, from small to large, from dark to light, from blocked to unblocked, from part to whole, from meaningless to meaningful, from withered to lively, from stagnant to lively, from deficient to complete, from turbulent to stable, from contradictory to harmonious. Therefore, "the true function of thought is to establish, to give meaning, to inspire, to be lively. Its object is not the decaying remains of sensation, but a living world." However, true thought, of course, is not limited to the givens of sensation, but it is not separated from the givens of sensation; although it does not drown in reality, it does not abandon reality; it is only innovation, only transcendence, not building pavilions in the void. The nature of thought lies in its process of self-transcendence or ideality starting from reality. The reason why it can be united with the concept of freedom also lies in this transcendent or expansive ideality of turning the unfamiliar into the familiar, and affirming the self from the non-self. Because free action expresses the same transcendent spirit as the activity of thought. They all want to transcend their starting point and find a settlement in this transcendent activity. It is impossible to unite with the great whole without transcendence and exhaust the nature of the subject of thought and action, so it is impossible to get settled without transcendence. Transcendence and settlement go hand in hand, just as freedom and thought are inseparable. Hegel said: "Those who speak of freedom and reject thought do not know what they are talking about." But what is meant by thought here refers to the unobstructed function of the intelligent and wise mind, which is completely different from picking up a part of knowledge, or clinging to the past or trending to the new, eating without digesting, being stubborn and not understanding, thus being trapped in a bottomless abyss, a wall of ten thousand blades, a bond that cannot be untied for thousands of years, and ultimately losing one's true life, not realizing it until death. This point will be discussed separately.

### Academic Forest Anecdotes (14)

— Zhang Qiyun

Modern Western Thoughts (Middle)

(3) Regarding modern Western philosophy of idealism, in terms of its method of thinking, it can be divided into two major schools. One is the British school, founded by Locke. The other is the Continental school, founded by the Frenchman Descartes (1596-1650) and reaching its peak with the German Kant (1724-1804). The British school is rooted in the material sciences, values experience, emphasizes induction, and conducts individual studies on different problems. The Continental school is based on mathematics, mathematical propositions are a priori, not derived from empirical induction, so it emphasizes pure thinking and devalues perception. The British school believes in the experimental method, emphasizes effect, and values utilitarianism. The Continental school holds idealism, emphasizes motivation and rejects utilitarian concepts. In terms of academic style, the British school tends towards meticulous detail, while the Continental school tends towards towering structures, with clearly distinct appearances. The 18th century was dominated by the British empiricist school, which spread to France through the efforts of Voltaire (1694-1778), and the founding fathers of the United States also admired Locke's doctrines. Towards the end of the 18th century, Kant's banner swept across continental Europe, but British philosophy was little influenced by it. Kant's theory of opposites complementing each other is actually the blueprint for Hegel's dialectic. Kant's political thought resonates with liberalism, and Kant also said that human nature has its own purpose, and is not a tool for others, greatly advocating the doctrine of human rights. Kant's theory was not tolerated by the Nazi government for this reason. Kant believed that the whole should be more important than the part, and judging by this, the organization of the United Nations after the war should have a lofty status. Russell believes that excessive emphasis on national rights makes international cooperation impossible. The difference between idealism and liberalism lies in their ethics, with one school emphasizing motivation and the other emphasizing utility. Russell believes that the spirit of individual pursuit of truth is necessary, but it should not be taken to extremes to the point of self-righteousness. Morality cannot only emphasize motivation, and effect should also be considered. Russell's intention is that it is necessary to both rectify the righteous and seek its benefit, and to understand its principles and calculate its merits. There are various different interests in politics, and statesmen should be able to harmonize and compromise among them. This is the essence of utilitarianism, and the study of modern social sciences is actually derived from this.

(4) Utilitarianism. The philosophical radical school in 19th-century Britain was one of the currents of liberalism. This school considered Bentham (1648-1832) as its champion. After the Industrial Revolution, due to machine production, the population concentrated in cities, giving rise to various social problems. Bentham first proposed the principle of the greatest happiness of the greatest number, which is known as utilitarianism. Bentham wanted to replace religion with law, believing that the purpose of law and social institutions was to reconcile private and public interests, and that there was no freedom without law. He advocated the abolition of the aristocracy and the implementation of full democracy, including women's suffrage. At the same time, Ricardo (1772-1823) said that the exchange value of commodities was due to labor, creating a theoretical prelude to the rise of the labor movement. Since the 19th century, British social legislation policy has been most influenced by this school. However, this school is nominally a philosophical radical school, but in reality, it is still a moderate revolutionary group. On the one hand, they seek happiness for the majority of people, and on the other hand, they still defend private property, which is completely different from Marxism, which advocates the absolute abolition of private property. The policies implemented by the British Labour Party now uphold social justice, strive for world security, and do not infringe on the basic rights of citizens. They only restrict private property and do not completely abolish it, and they want to balance economic equality and political freedom. This British-style socialism is really the result of the gradual evolution of traditional thought since Locke and Bentham.

(5) Communism. The theory of communism was established by Marx, hence it is also called Marxism. Marx (Karl Marx, 1818-1883) was born in Germany and lived in Britain. His materialist view of history combines the dialectic of the German Hegel and the doctrines of the British empiricist school. What Marx called matter refers to the relationship between people and things, that is, the mode of production, or economic life. Marx adopted Hegel's formula of proof, but said that the great force driving the universe is not spirit but matter. Russell himself claimed to be influenced by Marx's historical materialism, saying that there is indeed great truth in it, but that it has its drawbacks when taken to extremes. Because society includes politics, economy and many other aspects, property is only one aspect, and the more precise and specialized the problem, the less the effect of economic factors. The philosophical distance between Marx and the liberals is not great, but there is a significant difference in practical politics. Marxism advocates class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, raises the banner of communism, and strives to advocate the nationalization of land and capital. Later, it was elaborated by Lenin and Stalin and put into practice. The Soviet revolution in 1919 was the first time that the proletariat seized power, which was obviously different from the general democracy based on private property. Russell and Dewey both traveled to Soviet Russia. Dewey did not approve of Marx's theory, saying that it was close to theology, and that the relationship between the people and the state was like that between Catholics and the church. Dewey also opposed violent revolution, saying that it would lead to dictatorship. Russell claimed that he and Dewey had the same feeling on this point. Russell's aim is to give equal weight to political human rights and economic human rights. He hates the concept of the proletariat taking power and existing either as master or as slave. The ultimate goal of communism is also the harmony of politics and economy, but the realization of this harmony may have to wait for the distant future. In short, although communism and romanticism have different origins, they later converged and resonated with each other. Due to the intensity of thought, they tend towards political totalitarianism. However, Marx advocated the dictatorship of the proletariat, but had no sense of racial superiority, which is different from the Nietzschean school.

### On Concealing Evil and Promoting Good

— He Ku

Concealing evil and promoting good seems to have become the nature of Chinese people. Therefore, when you open the obituary sent by someone, if it is said to be a eulogy, the deceased must be a perfect person of the generation, piling all the virtues on the parents, as if the end of this person's life is not a family's grief, but a loss to the world in general. In fact, even the great men of the world, their lives are multifaceted, maybe he once stole something, or "climbed over the wall of the eastern neighbor and deflowered his virgin". Therefore, flattering epitaphs and similar writings have long been denied their value. Its content certainly wants to "convey" a person, but it becomes a kind of patterned sculpture, not a vivid and colorful portrayal.

This is still constrained by the reluctance to wash dirty linen in public. When a filial son or grandson writes, how can he offend his ancestors? Franklin said, "Write the injuries in the sand, and the benefits on marble." People in the 19th century may still be in an environment of "improving social customs." Extrapolating its meaning, it is nothing more than concealing evil and promoting good. However, if it is to be regarded as a virtue, there should be a limit, that is, the starting point of concealing evil and promoting good is for others, not for oneself. Even in an autocratic era, the emperor still had to come up with a set of words to deceive the people, "The common people are innocent, the sin lies with me." In today's idiom, it is "self-criticism." This is not a virtue, but involves one's style and cultivation. If what Franklin said above is correct, my estimate is that it is the attitude towards people in a peaceful era. If it is a chaotic world today, I think it should be reversed as the guiding principle for oneself, that is, to write the benefits in the sand and the injuries on the marble. This piece of marble is your conscience. Often rubbing your injuries on the marble of your mind is not a way to reflect on your past mistakes. Writing articles should be exposed to the fullest, that's right, but after exposing other people's, you should also expose yourself in turn. Don't just write your own advantages in the sand, then it is equivalent to a filial son's eulogy, which makes people abandon the scroll halfway, which is a waste of effort.

Even writing the benefits on marble is useless. Once an atomic bomb comes, won't the marble turn into powder? Being able to write your own benefits in people's hearts is what is truly brilliant and never fades. However, writing in people's hearts requires some skill and artistry, which depends on how you write.

### The Pyramids of North America

— Cao Jun

If I say that the pyramids are in North America, then many people will be surprised, and perhaps many people will say that what I say is wrong. Indeed, the saying that the pyramids are near Egypt in Africa is undeniable, and everyone also knows that King Cheops of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt built a huge pyramid. But from Mexico in North America to the southern border of Canada, there are more pyramids, and one is one and a half times larger than the pyramid of Cheops, although the height is not as high.

The Cholula Pyramid in the state of Puebla, Mexico, is larger in volume than any other in the world, even one hundred and fifty percent larger than the Pyramid of Cheops in Giza near Cairo, Egypt.

The Cahokia Pyramid outside East St. Louis in Illinois also occupies a very wide area.

These newly discovered pyramids in North America are called New Pyramids. They were originally built of earth or rubble by Indians. Because the highlands of Mexico and the deserts of the Andes lacked stone, mud bricks were widely used instead.

The basic difference between the New Pyramids and the Egyptian pyramids is due to their different functions. The Egyptian pyramids are all mausoleums, while the New Pyramids are all temple sites. Therefore, the New Pyramids are flat-topped and not like the angled pointed tops of the Egyptian pyramids. The New Pyramids are surrounded by several conical tombs, which, like the Egyptian mausoleums, have long attracted the attention of general explorers. There are various valuable pottery, shells, pearls and gems... etc. in the tomb.

Indians are not as capable as Egyptians in inventing methods to preserve corpses into mummies. The custom of their tribes is to cut off the flesh from the corpses and only place the bones in the tomb. Therefore, archaeologists find it difficult to study the builders of these pyramids.

North of Mexico, these primitive pyramids are arranged near the Mississippi River and its tributaries.

The Cahokia Pyramid has an area of more than sixteen acres. Its volume is a total of 21,690,000 cubic feet. Its length is 721 feet on the south side and 998 feet on the north side. Its height is 99 feet, and it is called the "king" of the New Pyramids. Archaeologists say that this New Pyramid was built around 500 AD.

### Book

— Guo Ping

If you want to choose a few good friends, what a difficult thing it is! Many friends talk about benevolence and morality, but when you turn around, he will say slander, slander, and insult you behind your back. There are many so-called "wine and meat friends". Today you treat him to eat and drink something, he will say you are a good friend, and he can be so close that he can "commit suicide for you", but when your purse is empty tomorrow, he will sneak away. If you want to raise some money from him, he will deny that you are his friend. There are many friends who can only share hardships but not wealth. The eight years of the War of Resistance and the nearly three years of victory are an excellent example. In the storms of hardship, everyone "worked together in harmony", and everyone helped, loved, and sympathized with each other, but when the situation improved, they had to "fight for power and profit" and "intrigue" and could not blend into one. There are also many friends who can only share wealth but not adversity. In prosperous days, everyone is a friend, but when disaster strikes, when you ask your friend for a helping hand, he no longer pays attention to you, and everyone "goes their separate ways" and disperses.

However, books are not like this. They have no class concept, they have no time and space, and they have no hypocrisy and deception. They tell us all the knowledge of the world, the purpose and essence of life, and the existence of truth, goodness, and beauty. They will tell a poor person all the sins and troubles of the rich, and they will also scold and expose the crimes of the rich in front of a rich man without concealment. They will tell a miserable child the secrets of success, and they will also warn a rich young master that he will one day lose his family and his reputation in a life of luxury. You can take it to the North and South Poles or the equator, and it will never complain about the extreme heat and cold; you can take it to a thatched cottage, or you can take it to a prosperous city, and it will not despise your poverty. It can accompany you, comfort you, and guide you throughout your life. Choosing a confidant is the most difficult thing, because as the saying goes, "It is easy to know a man's face, but not his heart." Choosing a good book is very easy, as long as you are willing to choose it, it is as easy as turning your hand.

### Also on Criticism

— Nian Hong

A few days ago, I talked about Mr. Dai Youxu's article "On Criticism." After carefully savoring it again and again, I felt that I had a lot to say, so I rashly wrote down some opinions.

As Mr. Xuren said: "Who is without fault? If a person does not have a single mistake in decades, he must have been deified since birth." The saying "Even a saint has three points of fault" means this. However, although mistakes are unavoidable by anyone, it is not possible to forgive mistakes because they are unavoidable, or even to think that there is no such thing as mistakes in the world, which would be a big mistake. How can mankind progress? I think it must be due to the ability to constantly correct mistakes. Confucius said, "Do not be afraid to correct your mistakes" and "Do not make the same mistake twice." If you have mistakes and can improve, mistakes will become the driving force for progress. If you know your mistakes but do not correct them, that is an unforgivable sin.

The authorities are confused, and the bystanders are clear. It is always more difficult for oneself to see one's own mistakes, which may be the origin of criticism. Although everyone has faults, it does not mean that having faults disqualifies them from criticism, because criticism is about the right and wrong of things. Even if "in fact it is slandering one's own shadow," there is nothing wrong with it. In this way, mutually learning from each other and pointing out each other's faults, and both parties can thoroughly examine and humbly ask for advice, mistakes can be gradually reduced.

Therefore, we should make more benevolent criticisms of each other and establish a climate of criticism. Moreover, in a democratic country now, freedom of criticism is highly valued. The more truth is wiped, the brighter it becomes. Let everyone state their opinions and let everyone point out each other's mistakes. Only in this way can we gather the will of the people to do things, which will easily achieve twice the result with half the effort.

How should the standpoint of criticism be? Of course, it cannot be purely based on a personal point of view, so as to avoid easily falling into subjectivity. But it is not necessary to "take the other party's standpoint as the standpoint," because if you take the other party's standpoint, you will similarly fall into subjectivity. For example, today there is corruption in the officialdom. If we think from the standpoint of the corruptors, then we will come to the wrong conclusion that "Everyone is corrupt, why am I clean?" or "The reason why officials are corrupt is because they haven't made enough money." We should discuss things on their own merits, abandon private prejudices that vary from person to person, not condone what is wrong, and criticize what should be criticized. If the criticism is wrong, then we have the courage to accept the criticism. We know that the critic does not necessarily have to be more talented than the person being criticized, as long as he has the ability to distinguish right from wrong. For example, when we eat, we complain that the chef has made the soup too salty and the vegetables too bland. Although we cannot cook, we can taste it. There is absolutely no way that the chef would put down the kitchen knife and the pot and tell us to try it. Otherwise, there would be no such thing as critics in the world. The newspaper says that the government needs to improve something, and the executive will call the editor to the stage to do it; a literary theorist says that the theme of a novel is bad, and the novelist will call the theorist to write a novel to see, there is certainly no such thing in the world.

### Unrestrained Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 13 Striving to Remedy (106)

Qi Wan said, unable to help feeling sad, and said: "The next day, without waiting for him to speak, I opened the jewelry box, took out two diamond rings, handed them to him, and told him that you have a wide range of social contacts, take these things out, just to show your intention. In other words, it is not needed, you might as well take it away. He knew what I meant, he was unwilling to lend the things to him, he just smiled, put the two rings on his fingers, and said to me: You are right, it is not needed, I will find a friend now, and I will return the things to you in a while. As soon as he left, I also went out to buy a boat ticket, and rushed to Shanghai." Qi Wan finished speaking, and cried sadly again. Liu Ru listened to these words, sighed and said: "It's good to be back, you don't have to be sad, your future is very bright, as long as you are willing to work hard, there is a lot of promise, what I am most worried about is, you have been gone for so many days, why didn't you give me a letter?" Qi Wan said: "As soon as I arrived in Hong Kong, I sent you a telegram, didn't you receive it? It must be that Dao Yun is making trouble in the middle!" Liu Ru said: "This kid, when he comes back one day, I will settle accounts with him! Now that you are back, I plan to send a telegram to Peiping and send all your outfits here. You will definitely be very popular if you do dance hall work again." It is said that since Qi Wan arrived at the hospital, Zhu Su visited her, but could not get any news even by writing letters. Later, he went to Qi Wan's house to inquire several times, and waited until Qi Wan left before Aunt Wang secretly told him that the young boss had left Peiping. Zhu Qi was very disappointed when he heard this. He felt that this time, for the sake of Qi Wan alone, he had caused discord in the family, divorced his wife, and even become estranged from Yun Qing. Now that Qi Wan has left, to make up for this regret, he must associate with Zhang Yunxiang. Being able to repair their former friendship and re-establish a good relationship can still make up for these boring years. Zhu Zhai thought about it all night in the dormitory. He felt that Yun Qing was a person who was cold on the outside but warm on the inside, and very attentive. This time, she worked very hard to help him divorce Feng Sheng. It was a pity that he was so obsessed with Qi Wan at the time that he was too indifferent to her. She is a careful person, and if she is found out, it will be difficult to deal with. He also thought that she was infatuated with me, so this small episode doesn't matter. Now that Qi Wan has left, she may not be able to know clearly about my relationship with Qi Wan, so there is no need to be timid, but to try to find out. Zhu Zhai's heart was not as hesitant as it was towards Yunxiang, and he could not help but hurried to Zhang's residence. When he came upstairs, he saw Yun Qing alone in the room, sitting at the desk weaving hand lines. Under the glass panel on the desk was still the half-length photo of Zhu Qi. Zhu Zhai saw this situation and thought to himself that her heart has not changed. He patted her shoulder lightly and said: "The old lady has gone to Tianjin again?" Yun Qing leaned her body slightly to one side, nodded, and did not answer. Zhu Zhai sat opposite her desk, looking at her face without makeup, slightly yellow, and rather haggard, and said: "You have lost weight!"

### Newly Ascending Lingyin Cave

— Shi Shufan

Among the caves in the southeast, the most famous ones are the Shuanglong Binghu in Jinhua and the Shanjuan Gengsang in Yixing. The ingenious arrangement of nature has its own strangeness, but it is also because of the convenient transportation and easy access by wheels. If it is a remote and secluded place, protected by misty peaks, and the sound is isolated, even if there are immortal caves and divine doors, the hermits will not be able to explore its secrets. Lingyin Cave is located in Longmen Town, which belongs to Xindeng County, about forty-five miles away from the city, and is the hometown of the late poet Luo Yin. In this place, calves do not hit their noses and mosquitoes do not bite people. Folk mythology is still prevalent. The cave is high and chokes the mountainside, and its huge mouth swallows the sky. It is connected in seven places. Its width, depth, strangeness and danger are ten or a hundred times greater than those of the North Mountain Yangxian. However, since ancient times, few tourists have made inscriptions. Therefore, its reputation is not known and it has been closed off for a long time. In September of the thirty-first year, I followed the Fourth Comfort Group of the War Zone to visit the counties along the Yangtze River, and explored the area along the way. I was surprised to find it was a spectacular sight, and wrote a long song to praise it. Now I hear that the Fuyang Highway has been connected to Xindeng, so I describe its beauty to tell those who seek novelty.

What divine hand carved chaos? In what year did the stone break open its mysteries? A secret ancient new city is hidden. The mountain spirit roars angrily every night. In the deep autumn, I sought the strange and pointed to Longmen. The frost grass and sand were daring for a hundred miles. Only when the sun set, the stone was green, and my short hair went through the pine trees and came out steeply. It was surprising to float with the clouds, and the old vines gnawed at my hat even more angrily. There were hundreds of dangerous steps, climbing to the depths of the mountain. A broken temple blocked it in front, and the fallen leaves could not be swept away. Sweat poured into the moss, strengthening the sound of the stream. Lingyun Mountain was a thief and robbed my mountain. Looking up and striving with courage, I experienced the desolation and yin and yang reversed. Outside the cave, the village was full of red. Inside the cave, step by step, I was covered in痴雾. It was two hundred feet high and five feet wide. My head was thrown into the half-sky kiln. Woodcutters cut bamboo for torches, and shouted to illuminate the two walls first. The engraved words were vaguely recognized, and the first guest arrived in the early years of Daoguang. Then I knew that this cave had been desolate for hundreds of millions of years, and the Taoist records, Dan books, maps and local chronicles had suddenly leaked without a name. Stroking it, I shouted and startled the white bats, whose wings drummed like wheels to lead the way. Rising to the sky was even more like entering the earth. I turned left and right and only cried madly! The weapons of war were originally close at hand. This place was a world of its own. The flowing water under my feet was noisy with Guangyue. The stalactites above my head were as big as spring bamboo shoots. Ten thousand kinds of flying creatures could be recruited. The red, white, blue, and yellow were all different paintings. Suddenly, the emptiness answered Hongdi. Suddenly, it was as narrow and folded as a waistband. Sometimes the sand was as wide as a desert, and sometimes the green was burned from ghosts and monsters. The wings of the immortal birds accumulated rain on their shoulders. The deeper I went, the more I felt it was narrow! I only saw the郁瘴 steaming with wind and thunder. The guide shook his hand and the followers warned: If I die in the wilderness, who will worship me for not dying for the country? Moreover, there are seven caves in the cave. Circling up and down, groping and bending over, this is still a shallow taste of one-tenth. When it is dangerous and narrow like a bowl mouth, how can you enter the hole if your body is not a snake? When it is bright and leaks skylight, if you spin the urn like an ant or throw the well like a frog, how can you lead it out with your eyes confused and your heart confused? I want to bravely explore its secrets, but I am afraid that the torches will be extinguished and my clothes will freeze. One step, one look, one regret. I left the cave with frost white and crows scattered. Who is better off igniting a huge explosion, cracking the cliffs, and the sounds of stars and moons flying? Alas! There are thirty-six Langhuan Lingfu, and the ghosts and axes are arranged to be sent sometimes. Old explorations of Shanjuan Gengsang often click their tongues. Shuanglong Binghu is promoted as a wonder in the southeast. Now I see this and feel that the other is insignificant. Alas! The mountains and rivers show the world by means of human culture. How could Zhaojian not see or hear it at that time? Xia Ke is falsely called a good traveler, and he should be angry underground! Laugh at him for being a pedantic scholar who wastes paper and ink and cannot spread out of Xindengmen. Supervise me to write a long song to describe the thirty-seven cave heavens, and no one is like He Yongxin to promote the secluded! After singing, I threw the pen and looked east, thinking of the Hu horses drinking ice waterfalls, and my tears stained my scarf, wanting to wet the clouds of Jinhua.

### A Discourse on Inflation in Antiquity

— A Man of Importance

Recently, prices have skyrocketed, and paper money is worthless. Take the sesame seed cake as an example: ten years ago, each one cost one cent, but now a ten-thousand-yuan note can only buy two cakes. In other words, using the sesame seed cake as a standard, a ten-thousand-yuan note is only worth two cents compared to ten years ago.

However, so-called inflation is not only seen in modern China and Europe but has existed in China since ancient times.

Speaking of Chinese currency, the oldest forms were furs and shells, followed by pearls, jade, gold, knives, and silk, and then copper and iron coins. As for banknotes, they only appeared in the Song Dynasty. At that time, the Song Dynasty used paper to replace copper coins due to an empty treasury. These banknotes were called "Great Song Circulating Treasure Notes." This was the beginning of paper money in China. After the Qingli era, the people of Shu (Sichuan) received official permission to issue paper money with a fixed redemption period, called "Jiaozi." This type of Jiaozi was equivalent to modern drafts. Later, due to insufficient credit, their value plummeted, marking the beginning of inflation in our country.

The Song Dynasty was destroyed, and the Yuan people ruled China. Although there were silver ingots (Yuanbao) at that time, they also issued treasure notes, with the amount of money printed on the face of the notes, along with the words "Gu Zu Dui" (fully redeemable in the treasury). However, later, due to excessive issuance, the "Gu Zu Dui" eventually became non-redeemable.

Ming Taizu (the Hongwu Emperor) destroyed the Yuan Dynasty and established his capital in Jinling (Nanjing). He also issued paper money, called "Great Ming Circulating Treasure Notes." At that time, each string (guan) was worth two qian and five fen of gold. In the twenty-second year of Hongwu, a small denomination of treasure notes was issued, the smallest being worth only ten wen. However, learning from past mistakes and fearing a recurrence of inflation, the Ming Dynasty established strict laws. Nevertheless, the situation of high prices and worthless currency could not be avoided. Later, due to wars in the border provinces, the value of the banknotes plummeted. Consequently, the Xuande Emperor banned the use of silver. A law was established stating that anyone using one fen of silver would be fined one thousand guan of cash. During the Yingzong era, the previous order was reiterated: anyone who dared to refuse to accept treasure notes would be fined ten thousand guan and their entire family exiled to the frontier. However, such strict laws could not stand against reality. As a result, by the time of the Xianzong Emperor, each string was only worth one qian, almost equivalent to waste paper.

When the Qing Dynasty came to power, they, mindful of the chaotic currency system of the Ming Dynasty, decided to abolish paper money and established a bureau to exclusively mint coins. In the second year of Xianfeng, due to urgent military needs, they issued silver notes and cash notes. Official silver and money shops were also established as redemption agencies. However, excessive issuance by various provinces led to great abuses. Therefore, regulations for money and cash notes were formulated. However, after the Tongzhi era, the credibility of cash notes declined again. With the influx of foreign silver dollars into the country, silver dollars were imitated to maintain the credit of the currency.

During the Republic of China, many banknotes were issued by official and commercial banks. We will not discuss the issue of counterfeit notes. However, in the third year of the Republic, due to political problems, the banknotes of the Bank of Communications could only be redeemed at a discount. This was because hard currency was circulating, and various Chinese and foreign banks had their own banknotes. Therefore, the issue with the Bank of Communications notes did not significantly affect inflation at the time.

I am not an economic expert, so I can only describe historical events and hope that knowledgeable people will refer to them and come up with better solutions!

### How Much Heat Can the Human Body Endure?

— Bao Zhongqi

In hot weather, people sweat profusely, but how much heat can the human body actually tolerate? If a person is placed in an oven hot enough to cook an egg, what would be the consequences?

This question is especially important in today's world of aviation development. If a condenser fails suddenly in a jet plane flying at six hundred miles per hour, the compression and friction of the air will create an uncomfortable heat inside the cabin, possibly turning it into an oven. Therefore, the air force must know how much heat a crew member can endure, and for how long, without suffering burns to the skin or damage to internal organs.

To find this answer, Dr. Taylor, a professor at the University of California in Los Angeles, conducted an interesting experiment: he locked himself in a specially made "heat box" and heated it up. He placed a metal plate in front of his seat with an egg on it. He heated the box to 220 degrees Fahrenheit, and the egg cooked automatically. Yet, Taylor sat there for as long as twenty-five minutes. Although sweat flowed profusely, there were no other significant reactions except for an accelerated heartbeat (increasing from 82 to 162 beats per minute). Of course, after such an energy-consuming experiment, like a vigorous athletic competition, fatigue was inevitable, and some weight loss was also certain.

According to Dr. Taylor's report, the highest temperature the human body can tolerate is 262 degrees Fahrenheit. Under normal circumstances, water would already be boiling. However, the mystery of human physiology creates this strange phenomenon.

### Sinicized Western Names

—

There are many examples of Western names translated into Chinese names. If we talk about elegance, solemnity, profound meaning, and historical reference, then the most outstanding example is "司徒合登" (Sītú Hédēng), the current U.S. Ambassador to China.

The Ambassador's original name is John Leighton Stuart. If we transliterate the entire name phonetically, the surname Stuart could be translated as "Sītú Huá'ěrtuō" or "Sītú Āyuàn", and the first name John is commonly translated as "Yuēhàn" (although this transliteration is not very accurate, it has been used for a long time, such as St. John's College and Dr. Johnson). The other name, Leighton, would be "Léidēng". Altogether, that's eight or nine syllables, which is eight or nine characters. Abbreviation is, of course, necessary. (Editor's note: Mr. Ling Xiao is probably slightly mistaken here, as the Ambassador's surname is actually a compound surname, Leighton Stuart.) However, extracting two syllables (司徒) from the four or five syllables of the surname perfectly matches the existing Chinese compound surname. This is the first marvel. Traditionally, Western surnames are translated by taking only one character from the original surname and dividing it into two or three Chinese characters to conform to the Chinese naming convention. For example, Churchill is originally just one surname, but the complete phonetic translation cannot be fully expressed by a single Chinese character (one syllable). If the Chinese surname is one character and one syllable, then Churchill would seem to be surnamed "邱" (Qiū), and named "古尔" (Gǔ'ěr), while the name Winston and other words can be completely disregarded. Similarly, Roosevelt is a surname, not a given name. However, once it becomes a Chinese name, it has a three-character name with a surname and a given name, and the original Western name Franklin, etc., is unnecessary. The three characters "华莱士" (Huáláisì) are sufficient for a name format, so Wallace can be retained, and Henry can be omitted. "史太林" (Shǐtàilín) is enough for a name format of surname "史" (Shǐ) and given name "太林" (Tàilín), so the name Josef, etc., can be removed. This is how most Western names are translated into Chinese; there are countless examples, and they can be seen everywhere. However, "司徒雷登" (Sītú Léidēng) is different.

According to the above and common translation methods, only the surname Stuart would be used, which would be "司徒华脱" (Sītú Huátuō), having both a surname and a given name. The Ambassador broke the convention and showed unique ingenuity, taking only half of the character Stuart for "司徒" (Sītú), and taking only one of the two given names for "雷登" (Léidēng). Combining them into a compound surname "司徒" (Sītú) with a given name "雷登" (Léidēng) is grand and well-proportioned, with both form and sound being beautiful. This is another marvel. There were many compound surnames in ancient China, such as Sima Yi, Sima Hui, Zhuge Liang, and Xiahou Yuan in the Three Kingdoms period, and Ouyang Xun in the Tang Dynasty, and Ouyang Xiu in the Song Dynasty, all of which are well-known. In the Ming and Qing Dynasties and today, single surnames are more common, and compound surnames are less common. The surname "司徒" (Sītú) can occasionally be seen. When I was at Peking University, there were still two "司徒" (Sītú) classmates, both from Guangdong. Currently, among the famous people with compound surnames in North China, the most prominent is Shangguan Yunxiang (one of the deputy commanders of the bandit suppression campaign). The characters "司徒雷登" (Sītú Léidēng) and "上官云相" (Shàngguān Yúnxiàng) are perfectly matched in terms of character pairing, harmonious in tone, and equal in status (one is a Chinese general, and the other is the North American ambassador). It's truly a beautiful story of "a fortunate encounter." The two gentlemen may not have foreseen this when they were naming themselves. This is yet another marvel. (American celebrities such as General Wedemeyer, Senator Zhou Yide, and Ambassador Pulitizer all have very good Chinese names.)

The transliteration of the current British Prime Minister's name was originally "阿特利" (Ātèlì), but in the past year, it has been changed to "艾德礼" (Àidélǐ). It is said that the modification was proposed by the British side, which shows the Westerners' increasing understanding of the Chinese language and their strong appreciation for the taste of Chinese names. The first letter of this gentleman's original name is A, and its sound can be translated as "阿" (Ā) or "艾" (Ài). However, "艾德礼" (Àidélǐ) is more dignified (the surname "艾" (Ài) comes from the doctor Ai Kong in the Spring and Autumn period, and "德礼" (Délǐ) comes from the Four Books, "Lead them with virtue and regulate them with ritual").

The name of the current U.S. President "杜鲁门" (Dùlǔmén), was originally translated as "特鲁受" (Tèlǔshòu) two years ago. Phonetically speaking, the former translation is closer, because the first letter of the original name is T, which matches the sound of "特" (Tè). The second and third letters RU match the sound of "鲁" (Lǔ), and the fourth, fifth, and sixth letters Man match the sound of "曼" (Màn). Since "杜鲁门" (Dùlǔmén) is considered the standard. However, "杜鲁门" (Dùlǔmén) seems to share the same lineage with the Chinese poet saint Du Shaoling, and the even tone of the character "门" (mén) is also more composed and harmonious than the character "曼" (màn). The combination of T and RU sounds like the two syllables of "杜鲁" (Dùlǔ), which is also quite appropriate and natural. (Atlee and Truman both resemble the names of old banner people.)

Why do Western names only need to take the surname to be transformed into a Chinese surname and given name? Why do the surnames of the old banner people not appear, but are habitually used the first character of their given name as the surname? There are certain natural principles. Once this principle is understood, everything can be easily resolved. What is the principle? It is the Law of Meter, the pauses in human language are most natural and comfortable with two to three syllables, and should not be more than three or less than two. Although Western fonts are of varying lengths, if we take Syllable as the standard, we can discover the common ground between Chinese and Western languages.

Chinese is one character and one syllable, and the sound range of one measure (what Westerners call a foot) cannot be more than two or less than two. Therefore, Chinese names, whether they are two characters (such as Hu Shi, Sun Ke, the sounds are no less than two), or three characters (such as Pan Gongzhan, He Jingzhi, the sounds are no more than three), all conform to the natural principle of meter, so throughout thousands of years of history, compatriots from more than twenty provinces, hundreds of millions of Chinese people, all have names of this format. Is it possible that the ancients and modern people had a prior agreement? No. Is it that the laws of the past dynasties stipulated this? Also, no. In a word, they are all unconsciously governed by the laws of nature.

When translating Western names, only the surname is used as the surname and given name, so the original name is not used. The Chinese names of the banner people use their given name as the surname and given name, and the original surname is not used. The two are exactly the opposite but have the same effect, which is a matter of great research interest. Now let me give an example: The pseudo-Manchukuo Emperor "溥仪" (Pǔyí) has two characters as his given name, and his surname is "爱辛觉罗" (Àixīnjuéluó). According to the rules, it should be said that his surname is "爱辛觉罗" (Àixīnjuéluó), his given name is "溥仪" (Pǔyí), and his courtesy name is "浩然" (Hàorán). However, the surname has so many characters that it is too cumbersome. Therefore, when he was in Tianjin and made a donation in the newspaper, he only said "溥浩然" (Pǔ Hàorán), which means his surname is "溥" (Pǔ), his given name is "仪" (Yí), and his courtesy name is "浩然" (Hàorán). How neat! His surname (a long surname with four translated characters) is not mentioned. Hongdouguan Master Pu Dong, a Kunqu opera performer, is also only referred to as Pu Houqi. He is good at playing Zhou Yu, and the name reported on the stage is always "Surname Zhou, given name Yu, courtesy name Gongjin," so if Hongdouguan Master is to be added to the opera's cast list, it would just be "Surname Pu, given name Dong, courtesy name Houqi," and it would never be "Surname Aixinjueluo, given name Pu Dong, courtesy name Houqi." Another example is the Governor-General of Liangjiang at the end of the Qing Guangxu period, "端方" (Duānfāng), who was known as "Marshal Duanwu." His notices and official documents also marked his surname as "端" (Duān). In fact, his surname was "托活络" (Tuōhuólúo), which is also a useless, cumbersome transliteration. Therefore, his given name "端方" (Duānfāng) was used, taking one character "端" (Duān) as the surname, and the other character "方" (Fāng) as the given name. His courtesy name was "午桥" (Wǔqiáo). (Duan also had the courtesy name Taoqi, which is said to be of Han ancestry Tao clan. This is another system, which is too expensive to investigate, so I will not discuss it now.)

People want a surname but no given name, and the banner people want a given name but no surname. Westerners' surnames can be successfully transformed into Chinese names, and the banner people's given names can also be successfully transformed into Chinese names. They reach the same destination through different routes. It can be seen that the Chinese name is a model of ancient and modern times, both domestic and foreign. The reason why it can become a formula for names is by no means accidental. The reason is that it conforms to the natural rhythm of human speech.

Social Services

### Shen Bao, in Collaboration with Renhe Hospital, Baoli Hospital, Red Cross Hospital, Shangxian Women and Children's Hospital, and Huisheng Obstetrics Hospital, Organizes "Assisted Childbirth." Mr. Jinhua Feng Generously Donates More Than 34 Million Yuan. We Hope Poor Pregnant Women Will Apply Early and Warm-Hearted Readers Will Generously Donate.

The poor women's assisted childbirth campaign, sponsored by this newspaper, helped a total of thirty-six poor pregnant women in February. Among them, nineteen were delivered at Renhe Hospital, totaling 29 million yuan; eleven were delivered at Shangxian Hospital, totaling 30.538 million yuan; four were delivered at Baoli Hospital, totaling 6.515 million yuan; and two were delivered at the Red Cross Hospital, totaling 3.752 million yuan. The total delivery cost of the four hospitals was 69.805 million yuan. According to the contract, this newspaper should bear half of the delivery cost of each cooperating hospital, which is 34.9025 million yuan, an increase of slightly less than 50% compared to January.

Mr. Jinhua Feng still maintains his past generosity and has independently donated this huge sum of money. Due to currency fluctuations and the continuous rise in living standards, we can predict that the future of the "Poor Women's Assisted Childbirth" campaign will be quite difficult and challenging. However, we do not want to see countless poor pregnant women suffer from economic pressure and the ravages of disease. We can only make an urgent appeal to warm-hearted readers in the newspaper. We hope everyone can generously donate and not increase the burden on Mr. Jin alone, so that this campaign can continue forever and benefit poor pregnant women.

### Money

— Shi Wen

If you pursue money, people will say you are greedy. If you hide your money, people will say you are a miser. If you spend your money, people will say you are a prodigal. If you can't get money, people will say you are a useless piece of junk. If you don't want to get money, people will say you have no ambition. If you get money without working, people will say you are a parasite relying on others. If you work hard all your life and get money, people will say you have been a horse or cow all your life and simply don't know how to enjoy life. (Translated from "Ao Guan")
