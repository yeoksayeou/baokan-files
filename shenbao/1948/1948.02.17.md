### Local Fundraising for Self-Defense Expenses Can Be Added to Land Taxes; Central Government Will Still Partially Subsidize This Year's Adjusted Living Allowances; Ministry of Finance Convenes Meeting of Provincial Finance Commissioners

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The Ministry of Finance convened a meeting of finance commissioners from various provinces in Nanjing on the 16th to discuss: (1) the issue of raising funds for the establishment of local armed forces in various provinces during the war, and (2) the issue of local financial revenues and expenditures after the implementation of the constitution. The meetings were held continuously in the morning and afternoon and concluded that evening. Regarding the former, the central government originally decided that two-thirds of the funds needed for the establishment of local armed forces in each province would be subsidized by the central government, and one-third would be raised by the local governments themselves. During the discussion of this issue on the morning of the 16th, it was decided that the method for local fundraising of one-third of the expenses would be to add it to the land tax after obtaining the consent of the local public opinion organizations. The amount of land tax added in each province would be determined by the province in consultation with the Provincial Assembly. Regarding the latter, the general method would still be in accordance with the regulations of the 36th year of the Republic. The "Regulations on Adjusting Local Financial Revenues and Expenditures for the 37th Year" drafted by the Ministry of Finance would be temporarily postponed. Those attending this meeting included Dong Zhe, Director of the Jiangsu Finance Department; Pu Mengjiu, Director of the Anhui Finance Department; Chen Baolin, Director of the Zhejiang Finance Department; Li Rui, Director of the Hunan Finance Department; Meng Zhaozan, Director of the Henan Finance Department; Gu Xiaofeng, Director of the Rehe Finance Department; Li Zixin, Director of the Gansu Finance Department; Fang Dong, Director of the Fujian Finance Department; and Chen Zuping, Director of the Beijing Finance Bureau, and other nine people. Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun personally presided over the meeting. Vice Ministers Li Tang and Xu Baiyuan, Director of the Direct Tax Administration Wang Fuzhou, Director of the Taxation Administration Jiang Shuge, and Director of the Local Finance Department Sun Jinggong all participated. Chen Kewen, Director of Accounting of the Executive Yuan, also attended to provide explanations. Yu Hongjun presided over the meeting in the morning, first reporting on the methods of fundraising. After Yu's report, the finance commissioners from the various provinces stood up one after another to state their difficulties, advocating that all self-defense expenses should be subsidized by the central government. Chen Kewen then explained that the central government's current financial situation was also extremely difficult, and that the local armed forces were aimed at defending the local areas. If all the expenses were borne by the central government, it would be inconsistent with the practice of the central government being responsible for the routine expenses and munitions of the local armed forces, while the local governments would be responsible for food, lodging, and clothing. The meeting continued in the afternoon, presided over by Li [missing name]. The problem of local financial revenue and expenditure in the 37th year was discussed, and it was decided that the method of the 36th year would still be followed. The central government would still subsidize a part of the adjustment of the living allowance for each province in the 37th year, and the other part would be arranged by the province. Provincial taxes could be adjusted according to prices. If there was still a shortfall, the province should follow the central government's personnel reduction measures, reducing staff by 5% each month from February to June, reducing one-quarter in total. Secondly, the "Adjustment Measures for Revenue and Expenditure in the 37th Year" drafted by the Ministry of Finance was also discussed. Because it was too late to implement it in the first half of this year, it was decided to postpone its implementation. Furthermore, how the local financial revenue and expenditure system after the implementation of the constitution should be divided was also widely exchanged. Because the General Principles of Local Autonomy have not yet been promulgated, there is no specific decision yet, but several principles were decided: (1) Land tax will be split equally between the central government and the provinces. (2) Commodity tax belongs to the province. (3) Counties can levy special taxes, which will be implemented after the constitution comes into effect.

### Legislative Yuan Finance Committee Subcommittee Discusses Silver Coin Minting Plan; Believes Timing Not Yet Right for Currency System Reform

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The Legislative Yuan Finance Committee held a subcommittee meeting at 2:00 PM on the 16th to study the currency system reform plan submitted by Sun Ke, President of the Executive Yuan, and forwarded by Zhang Zhaoyuan, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan, from the United States. Dai Mingli, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, Fang Shangui, Director of the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank, and Advisor Wu Daye all attended. Zhang's plan suggested restoring the silver standard currency, estimating that 1 billion taels of silver would be needed to mint 1 billion silver dollars weighing five qian each to replace banknotes. As for the source of silver, in addition to using some domestic silver reserves, most of it could be borrowed from foreign countries. During the discussion, opinions focused on the possibility of obtaining silver and stabilizing the new currency. Regarding the former, it was generally believed that raising 1 billion taels of silver was not an easy task. Due to abandonment and wartime losses, domestic silver reserves were already scarce. Overseas, the US silver inventory was only around 200 million ounces, equivalent to approximately 150 million taels in our system. Even if all of it was lent to our country, there would still be a significant shortage. In addition, although Mexico produces a lot of silver, it is questionable how much it can supply. The uses of silver have increased, and silver is needed for the manufacture of aircraft engines and atomic bombs. Its commodity value is much higher than before, so the official price of silver in the US market is 91 cents per ounce, while the market price is only 75 cents. The supply of silver from abroad and the stability of prices are both unknown. Secondly, the stability of the new currency will inevitably be affected by international silver prices and the amount of foreign subsidiary coins issued, and will also be influenced by the current economic situation. Zhang's estimate of 1 billion taels of silver is about twice as much as when we implemented the silver standard before the war. The reason for this is the expansion of national expenditures. If national expenditures cannot be saved and international and domestic balance of payments cannot be balanced, inflation will still be unavoidable. Therefore, the foundation for carrying out currency system reform has not been established, and the timing is not yet right. After discussing for about two hours, it was resolved to conduct further research after Zhang returns from the United States in the near future and after consulting his recent data.

### Regulations on the Export of Yarn and Cloth to South China Abolished

### Restrictions on the Use of Negotiable Instruments as Collateral

The Ministry of Finance Formulates Four Provisional Measures

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The Ministry of Finance previously ordered all banks to comply with the rule that banks should not use negotiable instruments deposited by customers to other banks as collateral before they are cashed. Now it is learned that: in order to promote the above-mentioned order, the Ministry of Finance has also formulated four provisional measures to restrict the use of negotiable instruments as collateral, and has instructed relevant agencies to handle them separately by telegram. The measures are recorded as follows:

(1) For negotiable instruments deposited by customers in other banks, except bank drafts and certified checks, for which there are already agreements allowing them to be used as collateral before collection, the banks should comply with the provisions of these measures and stop them in stages. After the implementation of these measures, no new agreements for collateral use may be made.

(2) Banks should immediately sign written incentive agreements with customers who already have collateral agreements, specifying the maximum amount of collateral that can be used, and temporarily allowing the collateral to be used within the agreed amount. Without such an incentive agreement, collateral use is not allowed. Banks should reduce or revise these agreements in stages into overdraft agreements and close them all by the end of June of the 37th year of the Republic.

(3) Banks should, before March 15 of this year, report the names, account numbers, and agreed amounts of all customers who have signed collateral agreements to the local Financial Administration Bureau or the Central Bank for inspection by the responsible checking bank and the check clearing house. Those without a local check clearing house are exempt from reporting.

(4) After the implementation of these measures, until the end of June of the 37th year of the Republic, the paying banks shall not return any checks issued by customers who have signed collateral agreements for reasons such as unreceived collection funds or other similar reasons.

### Grain Conference of Five Cities Further Postponed; Uniform Pricing Not Mandated; Tianjin and Beiping to Focus on Wheat Flour, While Shanghai, Nanjing, and Guangzhou to Focus on Rice

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The grain allocation meeting of the five cities has been repeatedly postponed due to the failure of attendees to assemble completely. However, Grain Minister Yu Feipeng first convened a forum on the 16th with the representatives who had already arrived to discuss the themes of the future meeting.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th] The grain allocation conference of the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, convened by the Ministry of Food, will be postponed because the mayors of Peiping and Tianjin could not arrive in Nanjing in time due to bad weather. On the morning of the 16th, Guangzhou Mayor Ouyang Ju, Shanghai representative Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and several members of the US Relief Goods Handling Committee of the Executive Yuan, held talks in the office of Grain Minister Yu Feipeng to exchange views on technical issues related to grain distribution in the five cities. It is learned that the grain distribution of the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou will be implemented such that each citizen, regardless of age, will be allocated one shi dou of grain or fifteen shi jin of flour per month. The cities of Peiping and Tianjin will focus on wheat flour, while Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou will focus on rice. According to the Ministry of Food's estimates, the monthly distribution volume of the five cities will reach as much as 40,000 tons. If the preparation work for the distribution in each city can be completed in time, there will be no problem in starting the distribution on March 1. At present, the preparatory work in the three cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou is being actively carried out, and it is expected that the distribution work can be started in time. The situation in the two cities of Peiping and Tianjin is slightly different, but the distribution date will not be later than March. The source of this distributed grain is half supplied by American relief grain, and the other half will be jointly planned and supplied by the Ministry of Food and the local government (that is, of the one shi dou distributed to each person, five sheng comes from American relief grain, two and a half sheng is the responsibility of the Ministry of Food to supply, and the remaining two and a half sheng will be supplied by the local municipal government). According to the plans of the Ministry of Food, the distribution prices of the five cities will not be uniformly stipulated, and prices will be set in conjunction with the grain market conditions in each place. At present, what difficulties the Ministry of Food and the local municipal governments will encounter in the problem of supplying the remaining half of the distributed grain, and whether the Ministry of Food will purchase grain in various places in the future, or purchase foreign grain again, must be carefully discussed. In addition, the target of the grain distribution in the five cities this time is all citizens of each city, and there is no intention to make a special distinction for civil servants and teachers. Civil servants and teachers in each city can participate as citizens.

### Another American Aluminum Factory to Send Personnel to Taiwan for Inspection

To Explore the Possibility of Cooperation with Our Country

[Report from Our Newspaper] The equipment scale of the Taiwan Aluminum Corporation ranks first in the Far East. More than just Reynolds Company are interested in it in the American industrial community. In the opening month, another American aluminum factory will send a responsible engineer to Taiwan for on-site inspection and to explore the possibility of cooperation with our country. Regarding the preliminary agreement between China and the United States to jointly run the Kaohsiung Aluminum Plant, Reynolds Metals Company is scheduled to invest US$7 million. Also, because increasing power generation is related to increasing aluminum plant production, the Taiwan Provincial Power Company has decided to borrow US$10 million from the US Export-Import Bank to complete the Dajia River Power Plant project. The power generation capacity there is more than three times that of Sun Moon Lake. The Japanese originally had construction plans in the past. If the plan is completed, the huge power generated will not only supply the industry in Taiwan Province, but there will also be surplus power transmitted to Fujian. Regarding the joint Sino-US operation of the aluminum plant in Taiwan Province, there are various views within the Resources Committee. Committee Chairman Wen [missing name] is forcefully supporting the cooperation. According to reports, the Taiwan Aluminum Corporation borrowed money from a large aluminum factory in Canada before the "February 28th Incident" last year and a preliminary agreement was signed, but as a result, the Canadian factory went back on its word and breached the agreement. Therefore, what the future holds for the Sino-US joint aluminum plant still depends on future facts to prove it. Also, the aluminum raw materials for the Jingjiang construction have been tested, and the Resources Committee's Gold and Mining Department has already been notified of everything by telegram.

### The Tuition Issue for Public and Private Middle Schools

— Yuan Zhe

As prices continue to soar and educational facilities must maintain a certain standard, while the monthly income of people from all walks of life varies greatly, the issue of middle school tuition has become a major concern for educational administrative authorities, middle school administrative authorities, and students' parents in various provinces and cities at the beginning of each semester. The public opinion also hopes for a reasonable solution.

The opinions of middle school administrative authorities on this issue vary greatly. Some hope to increase tuition to enrich the school's content, some hope to increase tuition to increase the income of teachers and staff, and some hope to lower tuition standards to reduce the burden on parents. Students' parents always hope to lower tuition standards to reduce their personal burden. As for the provincial and municipal educational administrative authorities, they stand between the two, sympathizing with the difficulties of the school operators and the poverty of the teachers and staff, and also agreeing to reduce the burden on the students' parents. Therefore, before the start of each spring and autumn semester, everyone seems to be negotiating a tuition standard that can be accepted by all parties, and the provincial and municipal educational administrative authorities and the Senate become the final arbitrators.

Since the middle school tuition in each province and city needs to be decided on a temporary basis without any standard, the result is the following phenomena:

(A) Middle school tuition in various places has no standard. For example, the Zhejiang Provincial Education Department should set the tuition standard for public and private middle schools in the second semester of the 36th year of the Republic. The tuition for day students in private high schools is 3.45 million yuan, the tuition for boarding students is 4.85 million yuan and 180 catties of white rice; the tuition for day students in private junior high schools is 2.94 million yuan, and the tuition for boarding students is 4.35 million yuan and 180 catties of white rice. The tuition for day students in municipal high schools is 1.06 million yuan, and the tuition for boarding students is 2.31 million yuan and 180 catties of white rice. Junior high school students pay 80,000 yuan less. The tuition for private middle schools in Hubei Province this semester is 2.6 million yuan for high schools and 2.2 million yuan for junior high schools. The tuition standard for public and private middle schools in Shanghai this semester has not yet been determined. According to reports, the tuition for day students in private high schools is two and a half dan of rice, which is about 4.5 million legal tender, and the tuition for junior high schools is two dan, which is about 3.6 million legal tender. If the tuition for day students in municipal middle schools is calculated at three times that of the previous semester, it should be between 1.5 million yuan and 2 million yuan. The tuition for public and private middle schools in other provinces and cities is also very different. The prices in various places are different, resulting in the collection of middle school fees in various provinces and cities without any standard.

(B) Private middle schools and public middle schools compete with each other for higher fees. - The tuition of private middle schools should of course be higher than that of public middle schools, because the salaries of teachers and staff of public middle schools and part of their office expenses are provided by the government, and the expenses of their schools do not need to be like private middle schools, which must be entirely dependent on the tuition of students. However, how many times should the tuition of private middle schools be higher than that of public middle schools! If the salaries of teachers and staff of public and private middle schools should be exactly equal in quantity, and the office expenses of public middle schools have to be largely dependent on the tuition of students, then how should the ratio of student fees charged by public and private middle schools be determined? It seems to be an important issue that must be solved in educational administration. The current situation is that public and private middle schools often watch each other when determining tuition standards. When one side determines the tuition standard, the other side will use it as an example to request an increase in the tuition amount. As a result, the tuition standard has gradually increased, and there is no fixed standard to rely on.

(C) The expenditure of funds for public and private middle schools lacks management. The expenditure of school funds should have a certain proportion. Although the salaries of teachers and staff should account for the majority of the total expenditure, it is worth noting how much percentage it should account for! If the funds of a school are almost entirely used for the salaries of teachers and staff, and the proportion of expenses for equipment, books, and sports is extremely small, then there is no improvement in its teaching facilities. However, the expenditure of private schools' funds is often less concerned with the improvement of school teaching facilities, and the fees collected from students are almost entirely used for the salaries of teachers and staff, resulting in a situation where the salaries of their teachers and staff are higher than those of public middle schools. As a result, a phenomenon is created, that is, teachers in public middle schools are more willing to transfer their positions to private middle schools. Teachers in public middle schools, in desperation, have to ask the government to follow the example of university professors and issue "academic research fees" and collect "academic advancement subsidies," "teacher appreciation fees," or "welfare fees" from students. In order to balance the treatment of teachers and staff in public and private middle schools, there is no reason to oppose the collection of such fees.

In order to achieve a reasonable solution to the issue of public and private middle schools charging student fees, we must determine the following two major principles for reference:

(A) We must base on the types and standards of fees collected as stipulated in Chapter XI of the "Revised Middle School Regulations." The articles stipulated in these regulations are very reasonable, and we must earnestly implement them, but they have now been neglected by the educational administration and middle school administration authorities.

(B) Although the current prices are very different from the pre-war prices, we can still use the cost of living index or the price index as a basis to increase the multiple of various expenses. The current price index is about 200,000 times, while the cost of living index is still less than 100,000 times. If calculated according to the price index, it is too high; if calculated according to the cost of living index, it is too low. The most appropriate method should be a compromise between the two. For example, if the price index is 200,000 times and the cost of living index is 100,000 times, then the multiple for collecting middle school student fees is about 150,000 times.

Based on the aforementioned second principle, Article 80 of the Revised Middle School Regulations stipulates that there are three types of student fees collected by middle schools: (1) tuition; (2) book fees; (3) sports fees. According to Article 86, the actual amount of various fees collected by middle schools in each province should be determined by the educational administrative authorities of each province and city, taking into account the local living standards; however, the total amount of various fees collected by public middle schools in each semester, as stipulated in that article, is ten yuan for junior high schools and sixteen yuan for high schools in areas with higher living standards, and seven yuan for junior high schools and ten yuan for high schools in areas with lower living standards.

Based on the above articles and calculated according to the second principle of collecting middle school fees mentioned above, using 150,000 times the compromise number of the current price index and cost of living index as the standard, the current amount of student fees collected by public middle schools should be 1.5 million yuan for junior high schools and 2.4 million yuan for high schools in areas with higher living standards. As for the total amount of fees collected by private middle schools, if it is one times that of public middle schools, then the total amount of tuition for junior high schools should be 3 million yuan; the total amount of tuition for high schools should be 4.8 million yuan. As for areas with lower living standards, the standard for tuition in high schools should be 1.05 million yuan for junior high schools and 1.5 million yuan for high schools. As for the total amount of tuition charged by private middle schools in areas with lower living standards, it should be 2.1 million yuan for junior high schools and 3 million yuan for high schools.

If we want to effectively implement the middle school tuition articles and middle school tuition calculation standards stipulated in the above-mentioned middle school regulations, we must do the following:

First, the Ministry of Education can issue an order to the education departments of each province and city to review and approve the amount of tuition in local middle schools in accordance with the above principles and standards. Each place should not make a standardless decision like the past bargaining. If this can be done, not only will the amount of tuition be more reasonable, but it can also save the local educational administrative authorities, middle school authorities, and students' parents a lot of trouble and conflict.

Second, how the total amount of student fees collected by public and private middle schools should be allocated and spent is a major issue in the management of funds. The author believes that based on middle school laws and regulations and taking into account the actual needs of the present, the items of middle school fees can be as follows: (1) Tuition - "Academic Advancement Fee" can not be set up as a separate item, but included in the "Tuition" to avoid social criticism. The tuition in Shanghai this semester has been stipulated as 60,000 yuan for high schools and 40,000 yuan for junior high schools. The tuition in Nanjing municipal middle schools has been stipulated as 400,000 yuan for high schools and 300,000 yuan for junior high schools. If the treatment of teachers and staff in Shanghai municipal middle schools is worse than that of private middle schools and they have to collect the so-called "Academic Advancement Fee", they may as well collect it from students in the "Tuition" item, it seems that there is no need to set up a separate item. (2) Supplementary Renovation Fee - including book fees, etc. (3) Sports and Health Fees - According to the regulations of middle school, these fees must be greatly increased compared to the current amount. (4) Other Fees - These fees are indeed necessary to collect in the current situation.

Third, the provincial and municipal educational administrative authorities must restrict the tuition fees of private middle schools according to the revised middle school regulations, and should not exceed one times that of public middle schools. The tuition standard for private middle schools in Nanjing this semester is 800,000 yuan for municipal high schools and 3.6 million yuan for private high schools. The municipal junior high school is 700,000 yuan, and the private junior high school is 3.6 million yuan. The tuition fees of private middle schools are more than four times that of municipal middle schools, which is really not in line with Feng. According to the standard I set earlier, in areas with higher living standards, the public junior high school should be 1.5 million yuan this semester, and the private junior high school should be calculated at one times, which should be 3 million yuan; the public high school should be 2.4 million yuan, and the private high school should be calculated at one times, which should be 4.8 million yuan. However, according to actual needs, the tuition fees for senior high schools are too different from those for junior high schools according to this standard, which is inevitably too high, and should be discounted by 20%. We should especially consider the burden on parents and change the calculation according to the cost of living index, and reduce its tuition standard, which is of course more appropriate.

Fourth, the provincial and municipal educational administrative authorities must restrict private middle schools to use half of their total income as the salaries of teachers and staff, and must not exceed this number. The salaries of teachers and staff of public middle schools are all provided by the government, and private middle schools should use one times the amount of fees collected from students as the salaries of teachers and staff; the other half of the income should be used for school equipment fees, book fees, sports and health fees, office fees, and miscellaneous fees. For example, assuming that the tuition fee for each student in a private junior high school in Shanghai this semester is 3 million yuan, half of it is used as the salaries of teachers and staff. Considering that there are 50 students in each class, the total amount of fees collected in each class is 150 million yuan, and half of it is 75 million yuan. If the average number of teachers and staff in each class of junior high school is 2.5 (according to the regulations of Shanghai municipal middle schools), and the average monthly salary is 5 million yuan, then 75 million yuan is enough to pay the salaries of 2.5 teachers for one semester. The tuition fees for senior high schools are higher, so the salaries of their teachers and staff can also be increased. If the expense income of private middle schools accounts for 75% of the salaries of teachers and staff in general private middle schools in Shanghai, then the treatment of teachers and staff in private middle schools is higher than that of teachers and staff in municipal middle schools. Teachers and staff of municipal middle schools have to request that, in addition to the salaries issued by the government, they also collect "Academic Advancement Fee" from students as a remedy. Therefore, whether the "Academic Advancement Fee" fire of municipal middle schools is collected depends on the tuition standard of private middle schools, or the standard of expense distribution of private middle schools. And the amount of collection also depends on the funding distribution of general private middle schools.

The above are based on middle school laws and regulations and the actual situation of the present. In order to maintain the standard of education, I hope that the Education Bureau and people from all walks of life will pay more attention and improve it!

### Legislative Yuan Inspection Group Returns to Shanghai; Wu Shangying Talks About Impressions

(Continued from Page 1) After Secretary-General Wu Shangying arrived in port, he spoke to reporters about his impressions of the trip.

World Situation

Mr. Wu said: "The world situation in 1948 is really likely to develop in any way. The democracy led by the United States and the communism promoted by the Soviet Union are waging a thorough struggle, and the result will change the course of human history. This struggle must not stop halfway, and no matter what its form and means are, they are all to adapt to the needs of the strategy. The current communist rebellion in the country is a part and a beginning of the entire world struggle. If it is not curbed as soon as possible, it may cause a conflagration all over the world. I firmly believe that the US government and people, regardless of party affiliation, fully recognize the seriousness of the threat posed by the Chinese situation to American democratic politics. But the fundamental solution to the Chinese problem still lies with the Chinese people. If our people can unite, we can solve all the problems and we can freely choose the solution method. Although foreign aid is urgent, it is still secondary. If we want to correctly understand the attitude of the United States towards our assistance, we can see it in President Truman's speech to European countries last year. Mr. Du said: "Please do everything you can do first. If there is something you cannot do, we will give assistance." If our people understand this, they should know to strengthen themselves and dispel illusions."

Overseas Chinese Issues

Regarding the issue of overseas Chinese, Mr. Wu said that the US government has expressed its willingness to consider relaxing the immigration quota. However, there are more than 10,000 overseas Chinese in the United States who have not obtained legal status due to incomplete legal procedures. Although the House of Representatives has passed a bill to resolve this difficulty, it is still awaiting passage by the Senate. Last year, the Canadian Parliament passed a bill allowing native-born overseas Chinese to bring their families into the country. Although the method is better than in the past, it is still far from ideal. As for the restriction on the freedom of business for overseas Chinese in the Philippines, when I passed through the Philippines, its President and Vice President both sincerely explained, hoping for understanding and continued cooperation. At the same time, we also advised local overseas Chinese leaders to take a long-term view and give more support to the Filipinos.

The Claim That an American Company Invested in the Zhongyuan Paper Pulp Factory in Fujian is Not True
〔Our News Service〕The rumor that an American company is cooperating with the Zhongyuan Paper Mill and planning to establish a large-scale wood pulp mill in Fujian with 20 million US dollars is not true, according to the person in charge of the factory. The reporter interviewed Qian Zining, the person in charge of the Zhongyuan Paper Mill, yesterday. According to him, the factory was commissioned by the Economic Commission to establish a wood pulp mill in Fujian in order to use local materials and save 3 million US dollars in foreign exchange used to import paper every year. Currently, the machinery for the wood pulp mill is still in Shanghai, and the import of some raw materials has not been approved by the Import and Export Control Commission, so the specific plan cannot be carried out. The report from Fuzhou that the Zhongyuan Factory sent personnel to Fujian with Chinese technicians, and that the American Jiangnan Construction Company is cooperating with Zhongyuan to build a factory with 20 million US dollars, seems to be entirely speculation from the Fujian Construction Department.

Should the Unpaid Price for Yarn Purchased by Puppet Organizations During the Occupation Be Compensated? The Judicial Yuan Interprets Doubts from the Executive Yuan
〔Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 16th〕The Judicial Yuan recently interpreted the following question from the Executive Yuan regarding whether the yarn requisitioned by puppet organizations during the occupation, for which one-fourth of the price remains unpaid, should be returned or compensated: The Executive Yuan should decide to offer compensation. The original memorandum from the Executive Yuan is as follows: During the occupation period, puppet organizations requisitioned yarn from Mr. A and formally established a contract, delivered warehouse receipts, and completed the buying and selling procedures. Mr. A and others received deposit slips from the puppet reserve bank and withdrew the funds in installments. After the victory, one-fourth of the deposit slips had not been cashed, and most of them were puppet banknotes, with a small portion being gold. Mr. A and other professional groups, on the grounds that the yarn was forcibly purchased by the enemy and puppet organizations, requested that government agencies allocate the unpaid one-fourth of the yarn in the cases of receiving enemy and puppet yarn, which would be distributed by the professional groups. There are three opinions on whether the yarn should be returned or compensated.
A. The one-fourth yarn should not be returned. The reasons are as follows:

(1) The explanation in Consultation No. 2423 of your court states that when the enemy and puppet industries are auctioned by auction agencies, and the auction winner obtains ownership, the rights are obtained originally. If the original tenant files a lawsuit with the court to confirm the continued validity of the original lease contract, it should be rejected. In addition, Consultation No. 3598 of your court replies that regarding whether Mr. A, who purchased furniture from a Japanese merchant in good faith after the effective date of the transfer of enemy property and whose furniture has been sealed, can request compensation or return of the furniture, the explanation is that Mr. A may not request compensation for losses or request the return of furniture from the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau. Referring to the meaning of the above two cases, government agencies can refuse to recognize the unpaid portion of one-fourth of the price.

(2) According to Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Regulations, "Those who were forced to receive by the Japanese side should be returned to the original owners." This yarn was purchased by the puppet side, not forcibly received, and there is no basis for returning it.

(3) The puppet side's purchase of yarn had formal contracts, and the warehouse receipts had also been delivered, completing the buying and selling procedures. What the enemy and puppet property handling agency received was enemy and puppet materials.

B. One-fourth of the price should be returned. The reasons are as follows:

(1) According to Article 4, Paragraph 4 of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Regulations in the recovered areas, "The debts of enemy and puppet industries should be cleared separately within the scope of the total value of each asset." The unpaid portion of the price of this yarn is a debt of the enemy and puppet industries, and the debt should be cleared within the received yarn, that is, it should be converted into legal tender, and received by the deposit slip holder.

(2) The yarn merchants have accepted the price for the purchase of this yarn by the puppet side. However, one part of the price is a deposit slip from the puppet Central Reserve Bank, and the debt has not been paid. Although there is no right to claim the return of the actual goods because the property rights of the yarn have been transferred, the right to claim the settlement of the debt still exists.

(3) The former Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau has issued instructions to some yarn companies stating, "If each yarn company holds a deposit slip from the puppet Central Reserve Bank, and there are unpaid portions of the price, they can directly apply to the puppet Central Reserve Bank for settlement." This means that the government handling agency has recognized that its debts can be settled.

(4) If the government believes that the puppet organization's requisition order is invalid, then the existing yarn should be returned. If it recognizes that the requisition is still valid, then it should bear its debt in accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 4 of the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Regulations in the recovered areas. One of the two must be chosen.

C. One-fourth of the yarn should be returned. The reasons are as follows:

(1) The yarn requisitioned by the enemy and puppet organizations is compulsory and should be treated the same as real estate such as factory buildings. The unpaid one-fourth of the price should be returned as actual goods.

(2) The government should deny the deceptive looting behavior of the enemy and puppets. The requisition of this yarn is no different from stolen goods, and the actual goods should be returned to the victims for the unpaid portion of the price.

The above three opinions each have their own reasons. The matter concerns ambiguities in the application of laws and regulations, and the case is pending. I hereby request you to investigate, interpret, and reply.

The Soviet Union Openly Violates the Moscow Agreement: North Korea Creates a Puppet Government
Drafting a Constitution, Flag Style, and Forming Armed Forces, the Prelude to the North-South Korean Civil War Has Been Set
〔United Press, Seoul, 16th〕Senior officials of the US military government today declared: The Soviet Union has established a puppet government in North Korea, and has formulated its own constitution, flag, and formed an army. This action is an open violation of the Moscow Agreement.

〔United Press, Seoul, 16th〕A certain official of the US military government declared today: The Soviet Union's establishment of a puppet government in North Korea is aimed at the United Nations Little Assembly's discussion on Thursday of the report of the delegation stationed in Korea. The Soviet Union now intends to disregard any resolutions of the United Nations Little Assembly and decide to act unilaterally. The Soviet Union also intends to suddenly withdraw its troops stationed in North Korea in order to force the US military to withdraw from South Korea as well.

〔Reuters, New York, 16th〕The New York Times' Seoul correspondent stated: The Soviet authorities and the Communist Party in Korea are stepping up efforts to complete the Soviet-directed government in North Korea. It is expected that a "Pan-Korean Government" will be announced before the United Nations Little Assembly concludes its debate on the Korean issue. North Korean radio announced that the Fourth Plenary Session of the North Korean People's Committee has passed the constitution of the People's Republic of Korea, which will be voted on in mid-March, and the establishment of the Korean government will be announced, presenting the United Nations organization with a fait accompli. Then the next step will be the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Korea. The New York Times reporter said that American observers expect that after the Soviet troops withdraw from Korea, the North Korean government will launch provocative actions against South Korea, and South Korea has no self-defense force other than the US military. Some Koreans are very pessimistic about the future. They believe that the prelude to the civil war between the South Korean government established by the United Nations organization and the already existing North Korean government has been set. They do not understand why the United Nations organization has not expressed any opinion on the Soviet Union's actions.

〔Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 16th〕North Korean radio has announced the content of the new constitution for the future organization of the Korean People's Republic, and stated that the capital of the republic will be in Seoul, but will be temporarily located in Pyongyang until a united government is established. The last article of the constitution stipulates the new national flag of Korea, which will have a five-pointed red star and a hammer and sickle. According to previous reports from Pyongyang Radio, the new constitution is entirely based on the Soviet constitution and will be submitted to a referendum by the people around March 15 this year. It is now implied that the North Korean People's Committee, established on August 15, 1945, will transform into an independent government representing North and South Korea. US military authorities here believe that the announcement of this new constitution, following a week after the official announcement of the People's Army, shows that the North Korean People's Army will launch an attack on South Korea after the US military withdraws. According to US military sources, the People's Army, which paraded in Pyongyang City on February 8, has field weapons and Soviet-made artillery. It is said to have a total of 200,000 people and has undergone two years of rigorous training. The armed forces of the South Korean interim government are said to have only 40,000 police officers and 20,000 military personnel equipped with Japanese rifles.

Truman Asks Congress to Appropriate More Funds to Strengthen Military Aid to Greece and Turkey, and the Aid to China Bill Will Also Be Discussed by Congress
〔Our News Service〕New York, 16th Broadcast: Washington News, President Truman submitted to the Senate and House of Representatives today his second quarterly report on the aid to Greece and Turkey plan, in which he accused the Communist Party's "tyrannical" actions in Greece, and said that he will ask Congress to provide more military assistance to Greece and Turkey. The report also includes a letter stating that if the European Recovery Program is approved by Congress, continued economic aid to Greece and Turkey will be included. However, military aid to Greece and Turkey is not provided for in the plan, so it will be submitted to Congress separately.

〔United Press, Washington, 15th〕The US $570 million aid to China bill will be submitted to Congress for discussion by Truman this week. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee can immediately meet to review it. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee completed its review of the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe on Friday. At the same time, it is learned that the National Advisory Council is studying a method to enable European countries receiving aid to repay their loans when they are able. The method is to offset the income and expenditure of US dollars received by each country. If there is still a surplus, it will be used to repay the United States. If there is no surplus, the United States will stipulate a reduction in the amount of principal and interest to be repaid, or grant an extension.

〔Central News Agency, Washington, 15th, United Press〕According to sources revealed today, US State Department guests have suggested to congressional leaders that the Marshall Plan must be passed before April 1, otherwise the United States may have to implement an emergency assistance plan to prevent the Communist Party's spring offensive in Europe. The final action of the Senate before April 1 seems certain, but some senators have doubts as to whether the House of Representatives will be able to take action before this deadline. The State Department's reason is based on the fact that the emergency assistance plan of US $522 million to France, Italy, and Austria will expire six weeks from now. A State Department spokesperson pointed out that the situation in Austria is particularly serious. State Department officials said that in view of the actions taken by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the Marshall Plan last week, the State Department will request additional appropriations for these countries.

Taft and Vandenberg Disagree on Aid to Europe
〔Reuters, Washington, 15th〕The Republican Party's opinions on the European Recovery Program may be divided. The Senate has decided to begin debate on the European Recovery Program in March. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to formally approve the plan on Tuesday for the entire four-year period and the US $5.3 billion required for the first twelve months. Although Vandenberg is the leader of the Republican Party's foreign policy, Senator Taft is the leader of domestic issues. He has repeatedly stated that foreign aid expenditures should not exceed US $4 billion per twelve months. He has bluntly stated that the amount of US $5.3 billion is too much.

South Slav Country Sends Military Officers to Marcos' Headquarters
〔Reuters, Athens, 16th〕Semi-official Greek sources: Yugoslavia has sent a military advisor to the headquarters of the guerrilla commander Marcos, and Bulgaria has also sent a liaison officer.

〔Reuters, Budapest, 15th〕Greek guerrilla commander General Marcos met with reporters from the Communist Party newspaper and announced that seven-tenths of the land in Greece has been liberated. Marcos also said that his military position is very favorable. Although the 200,000 fascist troops are well-equipped, the internal conflicts between fascists and free men within the army are severe, so the Greek Democratic Army is by no means inferior to the fascist army.

Heads of British and American Military Delegations Join the Greek Defense Committee, Greece Conscripts Five Classes of Reservists
〔United Press, Athens, 15th〕The Greek government on the 15th conscripted five classes of military reservists, bringing the total number of troops in the country to 200,000. The Ministry of Public Order will order 6,000 people to join the 12 new battalions approved by the US military mission. This order applies to military reservists from the 1930 to 1935 classes.

〔United Press, Athens, 15th〕Officials announced today that the heads of the British and American military delegations stationed in Greece have joined the Greek Defense Committee. Previously, only observers from the British and American sides participated in the meeting. The announcement was made two hours after the meeting between the Greek government authorities and the British and American diplomatic representatives, and stated, "The relationship between the Greek government and the US and British delegations has now been clearly defined." The new head of the US military delegation to Greece, Fleet, is on his way to Greece and will serve on the Defense Committee, giving him the power to speak on the Greek government's military conquest of guerrillas and the organization of the Greek army. Fleet will also serve as the commander-in-chief of the US Army, Navy, and Air Force in Greece. The former head of the US military delegation, Livesay, retains the title of commander, but his powers are limited to the distribution of military supplies. As for Griswold, the director of the American aid to Greece fund, he will continue to participate in the Defense Conference as an observer. The British and American countries have equal status on the Greek Defense Committee. The British member is Downs, the commander-in-chief of the British army stationed in Greece, who will also serve as the head of the British military training group stationed in Greece. The former head of the group, Rawlings, has been recalled to his country. Britain and the United States had previously firmly opposed the Greek government's mixing of politics into the military. The Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Sophoulis was accused of recruiting high-ranking generals into the party, forcing the commander of the Northern Greek Army, Vandilis, to resign. Britain and the United States protested against this, but were rejected by Sophoulis. This agreement between Britain, the United States, and Greece is intended to prevent similar disputes from occurring in the future and to ensure the smooth implementation of military plans.

Poland Builds a Steel Plant in the "Little Ruhr," Machinery Supplied by the Soviet Union
〔United Press, Warsaw, 15th〕The Polish government announced today that it has selected a base in the so-called "Little Ruhr" area near the Gleiwitz Canal in Lower Silesia to build a large-scale steel plant. The machinery is supplied by the Soviet Union under the Soviet-Polish five-year trade agreement. Poland's steel production in 1947 was only 20,000 tons less than the pre-war peak of 1.5 million tons.

Three Powers Negotiate the West German Issue, London Conference Postponed, France Has Not Yet Received Soviet Protest
〔Agence France-Presse, Paris, 16th〕It was announced here today that the conference of representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to negotiate the German issue, originally scheduled to be held on the 19th of this month, has been postponed to the 23rd due to the inability of Douglas, the US ambassador to the United Kingdom, to attend. The postponement of the meeting has also been confirmed in London.

〔Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt, 15th〕General Clay, the commander-in-chief of the US occupation forces in Germany, flew to London this afternoon to attend the three-nation conference on German issues with his colleague, General Robertson, commander-in-chief of the British occupation forces.

Says He Will Never Allow Soviet Interference in Internal Affairs
〔Agence France-Presse, Rome, 15th〕Italian Prime Minister Gasperi, in his campaign speech, stated that Italy's internal affairs will never allow interference by the Soviet Union or Yugoslavia. Gasperi also roared in an anti-communist tone, sternly accusing the Communist Party of misleading the country, saying that they are by no means defenders of Italian independence.

Italian-Soviet Trade Negotiations Stall
Italy and Yugoslavia Establish a Trade Agreement
〔United Press, Rome, 15th〕The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that negotiations on the Italian-Soviet trade agreement have been temporarily suspended. The reason for the stalemate is that the Soviet Union requested that it be resolved together with the reparations payment method.

〔Group News, Rome, 16th〕Foreign Minister Sforza said last night that the trade agreement between Italy and Yugoslavia is "extremely satisfactory" and that extremely important trade exchanges have been realized outside the limitations of the Italian-South Trade Agreement. He also said that Italy's textile exports to Yugoslavia have increased from 10 tons to 20 tons to 70,000 tons.

Austrian Premier Talks About the Peace Treaty
Hopes the Soviet Union Will Reduce Reparation Demands
〔Reuters, Vienna, 15th〕Austrian Prime Minister Figl said in a speech here today that Austria's hope of obtaining a peace treaty is stronger than ever. Among the four powers discussing the Austrian peace treaty, one country has already laid its cards on the table, so negotiations can now begin. Austria must be able to obtain sovereignty and guarantee economic stability as conditions for the signing of the peace treaty. A peace treaty that cannot guarantee these conditions is equivalent to a mere formality. When Figl mentioned the 200 million yuan in reparations demanded by the Soviet Union, he said that the Austrian economy is unable to produce goods worth 200 million yuan in two years and hopes that the Soviet Union can further reduce its demands.

US Mayors' Annual Meeting, Truman Calls for
Hopes to Help Restore a Sound Economy
〔United Press, New York, 15th〕President Truman on the 15th reiterated his call for Congress to enact anti-inflation legislation, saying that if rising living costs are not stopped, "the living standards of countless families will be in serious danger."

In the message to the annual meeting of the United States Mayors in 1948, the President made this appeal again. He called for the establishment of a large-scale housing plan and suggested a national education plan. The President also said in his message, "If education occupies a very important position in the future of the United States, then we should plan all types of education so that the American people can occupy a responsible position in modern society and be more efficient in the future than in the past."

Wallace Criticizes US Military and Political Figures
〔United Press, New York, 16th〕Third-party presidential candidate Wallace today called for the resignation of Secretary of the Army Royal and the dismissal of Secretary of Defense Forrestal and Secretary of Commerce Harriman. He accused Royal of "reaffirming the basic policies of isolationism" less than a week after President Truman informed Congress that he had ordered the end of racial discrimination in the army. He said that dismissing Forrestal and Harriman would be President Truman's "expression of loyalty to the United Nations' resolution on Palestine" and would prove that "Truman's words and deeds on people's freedom are consistent."

Japanese Diet to Nominate a New Prime Minister This Week
The Liberal and Democratic Parties Compete
〔New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th〕Japan's political parties and candidates for prime minister are now quietly waiting for MacArthur's explicit or implied expression of intent.

〔New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 16th〕When the Diet Steering Committee of the Japanese House of Councillors met today to discuss the issue of voting on the nomination of the prime minister, the opinions were the same as those in the House of Representatives, and there was no consensus. As a result, the same as the House of Representatives, no substantive provisions were made, although the vote will be held this week.

〔Reuters, Tokyo, 16th〕The election of the new prime minister of the Japanese House of Representatives, originally announced to be held around February 18, is now known to be unlikely to be held before February 23. Before the election, both the Liberal and Democratic parties will intensify their activities to strengthen their own positions and gain the support of other parties. Political figures believe that the political parties' delay in recommending a prime minister is due to concerns about the results of the general election. It seems that after the new cabinet is established, a general election will be held again.

Hull's Memoirs (23) North American Newspaper Alliance Copyright All Rights Reserved This Newspaper Translation Room
Choosing Between Work and Honor

Mr. Roosevelt's third term as president was a direct consequence of Hitler's conquest of France and Britain's being alone between the conqueror and us in this thrilling scene. Our dangerous position prompted President Roosevelt to run for a third time.

Until then, the president, in private conversations with me and some Democratic leaders, had expressed his hope that I would be his successor. But I had taken every possible step to show that I was not a presidential candidate. With Europe at war, Japan preparing for another action, and the United States facing countless problems in diplomacy, I felt that from the nation's standpoint, it was more important for me to continue diplomatic work under the president than to run for president myself. Moreover, sometimes my health was simply completely abnormal, so I had no intention of being involved in the domestic political competition in 1940.

From the end of 1938 until July 1940, President Roosevelt personally affirmed to me his support for me to be his successor in 1940. This matter was first raised in October 1938 when I went to the White House to discuss a key point of foreign policy with him.

I said, "This point will not be resolved for several years, until after this term is over."

His face showed a happy expression, and he replied, "Oh, that's very good. By then, if my efforts are successful, you will be sitting in my chair and can handle it very well."

I could have expressed my gratitude to him and suggested that we start organizing my campaign work. But I did not do this—quite the contrary. I showed him that I did not intend to be involved in the political work of the presidential campaign.

I said, "I believe the world is heading towards an abyss, and I think I can do a little more work in the State Department."

After this, the president brought up the same topic several times. Each time he brought it up, instead of suggesting to start organizing, I always said the opposite. If we wanted to start doing it, he would have followed suit.

Mr. Roosevelt also mentioned to many senators and congressmen across the country and Democratic leaders that he hoped I would succeed him as president.

In April 1940, at a cabinet banquet, Mrs. Hull sat next to the president. At that time, there seemed to be some signs that I was going to stand up and give a speech after the banquet. Mrs. Hull told the president that I did not like to give speeches, and he immediately replied, "Oh, tell him he had better get used to it. He will have many speeches to give soon."

Since January 1940, I have published several statements in the press, in which I stated that I had no intention of running for president.

In the spring of 1940, the results of public opinion polls showed that as the next candidate, I would get slightly more votes than the president, and far more votes than the Republican candidates who might compete with me. In my own party, this situation caused considerable panic among the extreme left-wing elements of the New Deal, including those who were very close to the president.

This group of people and others decided that the president should run for a third term, and they did not approve of me as a candidate.

Starting in the years before 1940, some figures in this faction and several columnists began to launch a series of sharp attacks on me.

As late as around June 20, 1940, when I went to the White House to see the president, he still brought up the idea that he had mentioned several times since October 1938, which was that he hoped I would be his successor. In these ten times, he had not given me any indication of running for re-election—in fact, quite the opposite.

The New Deal faction close to him constantly urged him to run for election, but he stopped them. From time to time, some commentators said that the president told some of his close friends that I was the person he wanted to choose in the 1940 election. In fact, he was just using me as a buffer until he himself joined in, and said that he had no sincerity towards me. But I am sure that what he said did represent his meaning. Since I had no intention of getting this position, I could judge more clearly than in the case of wanting to get this position.

In my opinion, it seemed that although he maintained the view he expressed to me in October 1938, he may have had the intention to run for a third term at times under the strong urging of several of his advisers. Judging from the words he spoke to me and others, he undoubtedly still hoped that I would be nominated as late as the spring of 1940.

Then, on July 3, 1940, I had a conversation with him. At that time, France had signed an armistice agreement with Germany, Britain was struggling to prepare to resist aggression, Mussolini had been drawn into the war, Japan was preparing to act, and our own position was very serious. This conversation made such a deep impression on me that after returning to the State Department, I made some notes in the usual way (Hull usually took notes in shorthand—translator).

The President invited me to lunch, and there were only two of us. During most of the meal, I raised and dealt with several State Department affairs. Finally, the President suddenly said: "Oh, now let's talk about some politics. You know, there are many people telling me, 'You can't just abandon us like this.'"

The President said this in an impatient, skeptical tone.

I said that perhaps there were a great many people.

The President said that he had read Washington's letter to Madison, in which Washington felt quite pained by the criticism against his running for a second term. Mr. Roosevelt said that he wanted to write a letter to someone like Senator Norris, and finally said that he wanted to return to Hyde Park. In this way, he said, the Democratic National Convention would nominate me. He asked me what I thought of such a letter.

I immediately replied: "Of course, such a letter would never delay nominating you."

Then the President began to consider how he himself could win under certain circumstances. He spoke lightly, intermittently, and disconnectedly. His tone was disdainful of the idea of running for election. He said that he thought he could win in

The Fee Standards Determined by All Levels of Schools in the City. The Highest Tuition and Miscellaneous Fees for Private Universities and Colleges is Seven Million, Four Million for Private High Schools, Three Million Two Hundred Thousand for Private Junior High Schools, and Two Million for Private Elementary Schools.
[Report from Our Newspaper] Private university and college principals of the city held their second meeting at the Tsinghua Alumni Association at 3:00 PM yesterday regarding the issue of converting fees based on the price of rice as decided in the previous meeting. After careful discussion, it was resolved to use yesterday's rice price of 1.8 million as the conversion standard. Subsequently, discussions were held separately according to four groups: general universities, church universities, independent colleges, and vocational schools. The tuition standards for each school were decided as follows: (1) General Universities: Guanghua and Daxia Universities charge 4.8 million for tuition and 1.6 million for miscellaneous fees. Datong and Zhen Dan Universities charge 5.5 million for tuition, 1.5 million for miscellaneous fees, and 800,000 for dormitory fees; (2) Church Universities charge 5.5 million for tuition, 1.5 million for miscellaneous fees, and 800,000 for dormitory fees; (3) Independent Colleges charge 4.8 million for tuition and 1.6 million for miscellaneous fees, with Shanghai College of Law and Politics charging the same as Church Universities; (4) Vocational Schools charge 5 million for tuition and 1.5 million for miscellaneous fees. Southeast University and Tong De Medical School, as well as Shanghai Dental Vocational School, charge higher fees due to the large expenses for practical materials and equipment: 5.5 million for tuition, 1.5 million for miscellaneous fees, and 1.6 million for practical fees. However, a final decision for these three schools still requires a meeting.
The meeting yesterday was presided over by Ling Xianyang, President of Shanghai University. Attendees included Zhu Jingnong, Ou Yuanhuai, Tu Yuqing, Li Peien, Yang Yongqing, Wang Yukai, Shen Sizhuang, Hu Dunfu, Lu Xirong, Chu Fengyi, Hu Wenyao, Gu Yuxiu, Yan Wenliang, Situ Bo, Guo Xiaoxian, Jiang Weiqiao, Zhang Yuanyang, Wu Yuwan, Chen Wenlin, Li Yusheng, Song Shouchang, Zhu Xi, Chen Gaoyong, Wang Zhenyang, and more than twenty others. President Ling stated in his speech: "The semester is about to begin, and the fee issue for each school must be decided immediately. However, what must be especially emphasized is that today, people generally believe that the burden on students' parents is very heavy, and we deeply sympathize. However, no one pays attention to the difficult lives of teachers and staff and the difficulties of the schools. For fairness, we must consider all three situations and seek a reasonable solution." Subsequently, Gu Wenliang, Li Peien, Zhu Jingnong, Ou Yuanhuai, and others spoke in succession. President Zhu also reported receiving a letter from the Poor Students' Association, requesting an increase of 20% in scholarships from the Municipal Government and allocation of supplies. The meeting considered their request unreasonable and did not discuss it. Furthermore, each school exchanged opinions and provided references on dormitory fees, meal fees, experiment fees, rice allocation by the Municipal Government, and teacher treatment issues. Due to the different situations of each school, no concrete decision was made.
The Mayor Convened a Meeting to Reach a Concrete Decision
[Report from Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu convened a meeting at the Municipal Government conference room at 6:00 PM yesterday with principals of municipal and private primary and secondary schools Zhou Feicheng, Jiang Jizhou, Zhao Dingxin, Tao Guangchuan, Gao Erbo, Shen Tongyi, Shen Xibin, Hu Huaitian, Zun Wu, Xu Guangguang, Wang Zuoren, and representatives of the Municipal Secondary Education Association Xu Zhenyong, Chai Zifei, and others to discuss the fee issue for municipal and private primary and secondary schools this semester. Director Li of the Education Bureau, as well as municipal councilors Xi Wangshu, Huang Bingquan, Xu Zexiang, and Tong Xingbai, also attended. Mayor Wu stated in his speech that he hoped to consider the burden on parents, the lives of teachers and staff, and social stability, and to discuss and determine a reasonable standard by comparing it to the fee figures set by Nanjing City. After a heated discussion, the following was decided:
The maximum amount for tuition and miscellaneous fees for private high schools is 4 million, the maximum amount for junior high schools is 3.2 million, and the maximum amount for elementary schools is 2 million. This is an increase of four times the fee figures from the previous semester. The amount of free education for poor students in each school must reach 25%. The Education Bureau may investigate whether its finances are open at any time. If a school has special reasons such as running outstanding programs, it may still apply to the Education Bureau for approval to appropriately reduce the fee amount, following the precedent of the previous semester. However, the increase shall not exceed 20% of the fee standard.
The miscellaneous fees, construction fees, and teacher training fees for municipal high schools total 1.74 million, for junior high schools 1.45 million, and for elementary schools 810,000. This is an increase of three times the fee figures from the previous semester. The Completion Ceremony of the Jieshou Library in Ningxia
[Central News Agency, Yinchuan, Ningxia, 15th] The Jieshou Library, built by all sectors of Ningxia Province, was completed at the end of last year.

Taipei Education System to Adopt a Nine-Year System
[Report from Our Newspaper, Taipei, 16th] Compulsory education has become widespread in the city, with an enrollment rate of 94%. In order to meet actual needs, it has now been decided to implement three years of vocational education after elementary school graduation, making it a nine-year system.

Promoting Continuing Education to Regulate Talent: Zhou Feicheng, Gao Erbo, and Others Suggest Establishing an Education Materials Center and a Career Placement Office
[Report from Our Newspaper] Standing Directors of the Municipal Education Association Zhou Feicheng, Gao Erbo, and others plan to establish an education materials center and an education career placement office. They submitted a document to the Municipal Education Bureau stating: "Upon investigation, this city is the largest metropolis in the country, and its cultural and educational undertakings are particularly developed. The number of teachers will reach nearly 30,000, but due to environmental and living conditions, the spirit of research and continuing education among teachers has not reached an ideal level and needs to be promoted. We plan to collect various educational materials from within the city and from abroad to establish an education materials center to provide a reference for people from all walks of life to study education and to increase the interest of teachers throughout the city in academic research and continuing education. Furthermore, there are a large number of schools and educational institutions at all levels in this city, and personnel changes are frequent. Due to mutual isolation, it is often impossible to choose people based on their abilities and to assign jobs based on individual strengths, wasting talent and reducing administrative efficiency, which will eventually affect the entire future of education. In order to meet actual needs, we plan to establish an education career placement office to coordinate personnel matters and benefit the progress of education. At the beginning of preparation, we request your assistance with a budget of 300 million yuan to facilitate implementation."

High-Quality White Rice Exceeds 1.8 Million: Social Affairs Bureau Throws 4,000 Dan of Rice Yesterday. Limited Supply and Price Increases in Production Areas are the Main Reasons.
[Report from Our Newspaper] The rice market fluctuated starting yesterday, with special-grade high-quality rice once rising to 1.85 million. The Social Affairs Bureau threw out 2,000 shi of rice at 1.75 million in both the north and south markets. The rice quality was white rice from Changshu, Wuxi, and Kunshan, which calmed the market. At the close, special-grade high-quality rice closed at 1.8 million, and white rice and thin rice closed at 1.77 million. The Social Affairs Bureau is prepared to sell rice in both markets again today to stabilize prices.
Yesterday, the total arrival of rice in the market was more than 9,000 shi. According to Ji Mingqi, chief of the grain section of the Social Affairs Bureau, there are three reasons for the market fluctuation: (1) The continuous rain has led to limited supplies. (2) Prices in production areas have increased. The local price in Wuxi, plus transportation and commission fees, is already higher than that in this city. (3) After the opening of the market for various industries, prices have continued to rise, which has greatly stimulated the rice market.
In addition, the arrival of rice is scarce, and people's hearts are firm, causing prices to jump wildly. In the morning, there was still a small amount of inferior goods available, but after entering the market, there was no grain of rice to be seen, creating a situation of demand without supply. Outside the market, transaction prices soared by as much as 100,000 yuan, while transactions inside the market were extremely rare. The Social Affairs Bureau began to throw 4,000 shi of rice. Each merchant was allocated 100 shi, and rice shops could purchase 10 shi from rice merchants, plus a commission of 30,000 yuan, totaling 1.78 million yuan. This was a drop in the bucket and did not solve the problem.
Stimulated by the soaring rice prices, people's hearts were firm, and vendors stubbornly refused to sell flour, resulting in an extremely limited supply. Prices outside the market rose by about 30,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. The price of bran initially rose but then fell back, with large bags of pressed bran rising by 12,000 yuan.
Among miscellaneous grains, soybeans saw the most dramatic increase. This was due to both rising prices in production areas and limited local inventory. Market prices soared by more than 100,000 yuan, an increase of 15%. Han口 sudden soybeans rose to a new high of 1.16 million yuan. Sesame soared by 150,000 yuan, Han口 white sesame soared to 2.4 million yuan, and Jiu江奶sesame traded as high as 2.09 million yuan.
Mung beans were high, red beans rose by 50,000 yuan, and Beng埠 red beans opened at 1 million yuan. Corn was flat, with prices similar to the previous market. Only medium-quality picked green corn was available, and prices also increased by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan.
Edible oil soared, and factories also provided little supply. Those with goods guarded them and refused to sell, resulting in few transactions. Jitt bucket crude oil rose to 4.7 million yuan, 350,000 yuan higher than the red market the previous day. Factory soybean oil was 4.22 million yuan, mostly returned goods transactions, with factories rarely opening. It also rose by about 350,000 yuan. Crude rapeseed oil hit the 4 million mark, and other hot rapeseed oil and large cart sesame oil all rose by more than 300,000 yuan. Jitt bucket small cart sesame oil initially opened above the 5 million mark and closed at 5.1 million, a sharp increase of as much as 470,000 yuan. Shantou帮 soybean cakes continued to add to the supply, soaring by 50,000 yuan. All four-brand cakes exceeded the 500,000 yuan mark. Wuxi Grain Prices Rise
[Report from Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 16th] With continuous cloudy rain and relaxed credit, the prices of all commodities have soared across the board. The arrival of rice is extremely scarce, and merchants are very interested, leading to a brisk market. Due to pressure from the authorities, no transactions were made inside the market. The black market outside the market is chaotic. White rice initially opened at 1.872 million and rose to 1.932 million. Rice paddy at 840,000, wheat at 210,000, and flour at 820,000 were unavailable. Soybean oil was at 4.5 million, and cotton yarn at 44.9 million, a sharp increase of 3 million.
[Report from Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 15th] This county is a rice-gathering area. After investigation, the grain reserves in each warehouse at the end of the Spring Festival are quite abundant. The increases and decreases compared to previous years are detailed below:
2,388,130 dan of japonica rice, 639,540 dan of indica rice, 14,674 dan of Xiliang rice, 29,890 dan of yuan rice, 2,248 shi of brown japonica rice, 21,756 shi of brown indica rice, 23,053 shi of brown yuan rice, 602 shi of white japonica rice, 1,537 shi of white indica rice, 535 shi of white yuan rice, 121,226 bags of wheat, and 41,736 bags of public wheat, 8,627 shi of yuan wheat, 30,200 dan of barley. 548,782 shi of soybeans, 178 shi of sesame, 362 shi of black beans, 522 shi of broad beans, 1,084 shi of white sugar, 2,034 shi of white kidney beans, 1808 dan of cottonseed, 3,210 shi of corn, 184 shi of red beans. 53 dan of raw peanuts, 17,0

Others engage in lavish spending for weddings, funerals, and celebrations, spending tens of billions at a time. Therefore, the general price level in the area is higher than in Fuzhou and Xiamen. Indirectly, this has led to frequent robberies and lawsuits, causing social unrest. How to channel this capital into constructive avenues is something the government should not ignore.

### Overseas Chinese Stallholders in the Philippines Strive for Business Rights

[Associated Press, Manila, 16th] Guo Laigen (transliteration), chairman of the Philippine Overseas Chinese Stallholders Association, stated at a press conference today that the ban on overseas Chinese stallholders violates the Philippine Constitution. He hopes that the Philippine government will allow overseas Chinese stallholders to resume business.

He pointed out the close geographical, historical, cultural, and economic ties between China and the Philippines. Whether in war or peace, overseas Chinese should enjoy the fruits of their labor in the Philippines, which need not be emphasized.

The Philippine Ministry of Finance's order to ban overseas Chinese stallholders clearly violates the Sino-Philippine Friendship Treaty, which stipulates that retail trade will be gradually transferred to Filipinos, but also stipulates that licensed stallholders will not be affected. Furthermore, it is illegal for the local government to forcibly ban overseas Chinese stallholders before the Philippines has made a final decision on this matter. He pointed out that all the banned stallholders were allowed by the Philippine government to reside in the Philippines, so the Philippine government cannot deprive them of their right to survival. The stallholders have decided to fight to the end in accordance with the law, "We believe that the Philippine government will be able to restore the livelihood of all stallholders."

If the Supreme Court makes a decision unfavorable to the overseas Chinese, the matter will be resolved by the governments of China and the Philippines. He emphasized that the overseas Chinese will abide by Philippine laws and only strive for their goals through peaceful means.
