### The Battle on the Bengbu Front Unfolds; Bandit Troops North of Guzhen Attempt to Attack and are Defeated; National Army South of Xuzhou Crosses Caocun and Advances South

[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, 28th] The Bengbu-Suxian Campaign, also the next stage of the Xuzhou Campaign, has officially begun with the battle at Guzhen. Last night, the bandits attempted to attack the National Army's Hugou position with a portion of their forces, resulting in fierce fighting throughout the night. By this morning, one bandit division had been defeated. The National Army initially reported victory. Fierce fighting has been ongoing in Guzhen since 4:00 AM this morning. According to observations from the air over Guzhen this afternoon, both sides are engaging in intense artillery fire in the area north of Guzhen. The Air Force is continuously bombing the attacking bandits. Fighting is still in progress this evening. There is also fighting east of Guzhen. It has been determined that the attacking bandit troops include the Second Column of the Liu bandits.

[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, 28th] Frequent contact among senior generals indicates that the Bengbu-Suxian Campaign has already broken out. Starting tomorrow, the National Army's three major corps, led by Li Yannian, Liu Ruming, and Huang Wei, will have established a highly advantageous defensive line along the south bank of the Huai River, stretching from Dongping, Hugou, Guzhen, to Tuohezhen, waiting for the communist bandits to come and be annihilated, aiming to create an even greater victory following the Xuzhou triumph.

[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, 28th] The battle on this front has already begun. Bengbu's public morale is extremely stable. The streets are bustling with activity, just as they are on normal days. Military transport is frequent on the Jinpu Railway north of Bengbu, and the Air Force is also constantly flying back and forth over Bengbu. Furthermore, a certain unit of heavy weapons troops from the north has now appeared on the streets, but residents pay it no mind. All trains between Pukou and Bengbu are operating as usual.

[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, 28th] Xu Shiyou, the bandit deputy commander stationed in Lingbi, leading four columns including the 11th and 13th, has suddenly fled west again, attempting to prevent the National Army from heading north to assist. The Li Yannian Corps on the Jinpu Railway front intercepted them at Xisipo and Renqiao. The Huang Wei Corps moved south from Nanpingji, preparing to turn and inflict a severe blow. Skirmishes have been occurring daily on the south bank of the Huai River. The Air Force has been frequently bombing the area.

[Special Dispatch from Bengbu, 28th] Military News: The communist bandits on the periphery of Xuzhou have almost entirely moved south. Their location has not yet been determined. The four columns of Chen bandits under the command of bandit leader Xu Shiyou have begun to flee west from the Lingbi-Suxian area towards the front-line positions of the National Army's Huang Corps.

[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, 28th] A major battle in the Suxian area has begun fiercely. Today, seven bandit columns and the Huang and Li Corps engaged in an interlocking siege and annihilation battle along the line from Xishipu west of Suxian and south of Nanpingji. The National Army's firepower is intense, holding an advantageous position. The Air Force and artillery groups are assisting in the battle, resulting in numerous enemy casualties.

### Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan's Topography is Prominent; Garrison Troops Temporarily Withdraw on Their Own Initiative; The National Army Formally Enters Baodi Under Su Dai's Command

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Beiping, 28th] The North China Anti-Bandit Headquarters announced today (28th): Due to changes in the situation, Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan have now become two isolated and prominent strongholds, losing their strategic value.

### Chen and Liu Bandits Fall Out

Leaflets Copied from Bandit Corpses: Liu Bandits Bitterly Condemn Chen Bandits for Fraud

[United Press Eastern Xuzhou Front, 28th] National Army generals today discovered leaflets again detailing the feud between Communist leaders Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng. Several papers were copied from the body of a soldier in Chen's unit, one of which stated: "Chen Yi said Liu wouldn't help him and said Liu wanted to surrender to the government. If Chen Yi stays, there will be even worse mistakes." Another paper stated: "Chen Yi deceived the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Communist Party" and is a "shameless thing." It also stated: "Down with Chen Yi, who is fighting for power!" Another paper claimed Chen was a "person who drives soldiers to their deaths," carrying out "fraud and betrayal" for personal power. National Army generals pointed out that these leaflets were different from any leaflets the National Army distributed to the Communist Army, presumably self-generated by the Communist side.

### Six New Weapons

New Inventions by the Chengdu Military Academy Engineering Corps

[Special Dispatch from Chengdu, 27th] The Military Academy Engineering Corps has recently invented six new weapons: a super flying mine, a burst firing tube, a battery quantity calculation table, a sound and light dual-purpose conductivity tester, and a demonstration board and test plate. These are highly suitable for counter-insurgency tactics and have been presented to the Ministry of National Defense for research.

### The Yalta Agreement Sacrificed the Northeast; The United States Should Bear the Obligation to Aid China; Contents of President Chiang's Letter to Truman

[United Press Washington, 27th] President Chiang Kai-shek once told President Truman that due to the United States' diplomatic errors at the Yalta Conference, the United States now has the duty to assist China in countering the communists. Diplomatic officials disclosed on the 27th that in President Chiang's recent letter urging Truman to announce a policy of aid to China, he said that President Roosevelt's diplomacy at Yalta should be blamed for the subsequent fall of the Northeast to the communists. The Yalta Agreement, among other points, stipulated that China and the Soviet Union would jointly manage the two railways in the Northeast, the Kuril Islands would be handed over to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union would be encouraged to sign a Sino-Soviet "Treaty of Friendship and Alliance." Diplomatic sources said that President Chiang's letter attributed many of the difficulties of the National Government to the Yalta Agreement, with the Sino-Soviet Treaty being particularly important. According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Union received many concessions in the Northeast from China. They said that President Chiang argued that China signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty, violating its own good judgment, only because it was bound by the United States' diplomacy at Yalta. It is said that President Chiang told Truman that the United States therefore has an obligation to assist the National Government in this current crisis. Neither President Chiang's request nor Truman's response has been made public. However, U.S. officials informally objected to President Chiang's argument, arguing that China's loss of the Northeast should be attributed to a lack of genuine will to fight the communists, improper use of weapons, and poor strategy.

### U.S. Aid Gasoline Exports are Delayed in Many Ways; Congressman Walter Judd Criticizes the U.S. Department of Commerce

[United Press Washington, 28th] Congressman Walter Judd, a staunch supporter of U.S. aid to China, criticized the Department of Commerce on the 28th for delaying the approval of gasoline export quantities, saying, "Chinese Air Force planes can hardly take off because of it." Judd said that fortunately, the U.S. Air Force lent 60,000 barrels of gasoline to the Chinese Air Force, allowing Chinese planes to continue fighting "in the most critical stage." He said that the original intention of the U.S. Congress to allocate funds for military aid to China was almost completely negated by the delay. Judd said that the announcement of the gasoline quota for the third quarter to China was made in mid-August, when half of the quarter had already passed, and the Department of Commerce only approved half of what China requested. Judd said that Chinese officials confirmed to the State Department that there was no misconduct with U.S. oil companies, and that the Chinese government did not owe any money to U.S. oil exporters, yet it took weeks before the department approved additional exports again at the end of September.

### Senator Morrow Arrives in the Philippines, Saying He Supports Military Aid to China

[United Press Manila, 27th] U.S. Republican Senator Morrow arrived here tonight after inspecting China. He said: After talking with government officials and soldiers in China, I am fully convinced that the Soviet Union is providing military aid and military advisors to China. I support U.S. military aid to China at this time. Emergency aid is most effective in halting the communist advance. This aid should be managed directly by the U.S. government. The current expansion of communist power in China will not have a practical impact on the Philippines or other countries in the East. As a Pacific nation, the United States will never allow this to happen.

### Yunnan Province Half-Open Silver Coins; Exchange Rate for Gold Yuan is Revised

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 28th] Ministry of Finance News: The exchange rate for the half-open silver coins commonly used in Yunnan Province, which was previously approved by the Executive Yuan, regardless of quality, was uniformly exchanged at one gold yuan for one half-yuan Yunnan coin. After the issuance method of the gold yuan was revised, the exchange rate should be adjusted accordingly. However, the quality standard should also follow the general regulations, that is, one half-yuan Yunnan coin with a silver content of 880 is exchanged for five gold yuan, and those that do not meet the standard are converted according to the silver exchange rate.

### High Morale on the Xuzhou Front; Everyone is Fighting Desperately and Confident; Good Impressions Gained by Foreign Reporters After Inspection

[United Press Reporter Jacob's Special Dispatch from the Xuzhou Front, 28th] The only impression I gained on the Xuzhou front is that the officers and soldiers of the National Army defending Central China are in high spirits. They are willing to fight bravely at any time, which is the opposite of what people in the Shanghai and Nanjing area had expected. When the communist army attacked Xuzhou, neutral military observers in Shanghai and Nanjing shook their heads and sighed, believing that the communist army would definitely capture Xuzhou. They often said: The most important thing now is whether the National Army is willing to continue fighting. They also continued: The National Army's disastrous defeat in the Northeast and the communist army's victories in other areas may be a fatal blow to the morale of the National Army defending Central China. But what I have seen in the past two days on the southern and southeastern lines of Xuzhou proves that this concern is completely unfounded. The National Army is in high spirits and deeply believes that they will not fail. Especially on the southern front, twelve miles from Xuzhou, the National Army's uniforms are neat, their equipment is excellent, and there are many means of transportation (including motor vehicles and livestock). At the same time, the National Army is well aware that they will advance forward.

When the reporters passed by, they threw candies and other things at them. The Shanghai and Nanjing comfort groups also gave them other gifts. When we stopped to talk to them, they returned the favor with cigarettes. When a few soldiers carrying wounded soldiers on stretchers passed by, they didn't seem to mind.

At the same time, the National Army officers and generals I saw on the southern front were all confident, capable, and able to win the love of their subordinates, especially the lower-ranking officers.

[United Press Reporter Jacob's Special Dispatch from the Southern Xuzhou Front, 27th] I went to inspect a prominent National Army trench meeting place on the southern line of Xuzhou on the 27th. At this time, the National Army had advanced five kilometers the night before. This time, the National Army operated at night, reversing the usual practice, because the communist army always claimed that "night operations are theirs"?

As we advanced towards an area that had been occupied by the communist army just a few hours earlier, the strong and well-equipped infantry under General Sun Yuanliang were clearing out the communist army's salient positions on the hilltops facing us that had not been destroyed overnight. This army was constantly being reinforced by cheerful and energetic soldiers coming out from the rear. When they caught sight of the foreign reporter corps advancing towards the front line, many of them gave a thumbs up, meaning "excellent."

General Sun Yuanliang was a famous general who bravely resisted the Japanese in Zhabei in 1937. He firmly believes that he will be able to recapture Suxian, join forces with the National Army heading north, and shatter the communist army's attempt to completely encircle Xuzhou. Now that the communist army has turned to attack Bengbu in an attempt to threaten Nanjing, he will wipe them out in one fell swoop. I then asked him if he thought he could accomplish this task. General Sun replied in broken English: "Certainly!" "Certainly!"

### Farming in the Fields and Business as Usual; Xuzhou Has Almost No Signs of War

[This City News] According to China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) news: CNAC Vice Chairman Roosevelt, who flew from Shanghai to Xuzhou yesterday to inspect CNAC's business, and a group of people, including United Press reporter Effoyal and Continental Daily reporter Kingen-berg, who accompanied him to Xuzhou to visit the National Army's battle achievements, stayed in Xuzhou for one day and returned to Shanghai at 7:40 PM that afternoon. According to CNAC Secretary Wu Jingyan, who accompanied Roosevelt to Xuzhou to inspect business: In this battle, the communist army suffered extremely heavy casualties and lost all morale. The National Army fought bravely and has discouraged the communist army. The situation in Xuzhou has been extremely stable recently. The outside world's speculation about how tense and turbulent it is is completely without any trace. In the suburbs, one can often see farmers driving cattle in the sun, engaging in winter farming. Business transactions in the city are prosperous as usual. Some luxurious fashion stores have a lot of high-end Western suits and high-quality leather shoes displayed in the windows, attracting customers, but prices are on average about twice as high as in Shanghai. When he inspected the urban area, he saw citizens leisurely doing things on the streets, with no signs of panic or tension.

### Discussing Our Country's Situation with the U.S. Authorities; Madame Chiang Flew to the U.S. Last Night; Expected to Arrive in Washington on the First of Next Month; The Aid-China Movement is Currently Being Promoted in the United States

[Central News Agency This City News] Madame Chiang Kai-shek, accompanied by Zhu Shiming, head of our country's former delegation to Japan, You Jianwen, secretary to the president, and two attendants, took a U.S. military special plane from Jiangwan Airport here last night (28th) at 8:50 PM, heading to the U.S. Madame Chiang arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 27th and went to Sun Yat-sen's wife's residence to bid farewell before departing last night. It is learned that Madame Chiang's mission is to visit the U.S. authorities to discuss the current situation in our country and will return to the country in the near future.

[United Press This City News] Madame Chiang flew to the U.S. from Jiangwan Airport at 8:50 PM tonight on a U.S. Navy four-engine transport plane. It is expected that she will stop briefly in Guam, but it is still unknown where she will land in the U.S. U.S. Army and Navy soldiers were heavily guarded at the airport, not allowing reporters to take pictures or talk to Madame Chiang.

[United Press Washington, 27th] It is generally speculated that Madame Chiang's visit to the U.S. is mainly to directly appeal to the American people for aid to China. Other aid-China movements are currently being promoted in the United States, and their effects may be greater than Madame Chiang's. The organized movement is launched by the Christian group "Christ's Resurrection Society" and the WFMV radio station in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The New York headquarters of "Christ's Resurrection Society" has issued a notice to its members, asking them to write letters or telegrams to President Truman and members of Congress, asking them to strengthen aid to China as soon as possible. WFMV radio station has sent 2,500 letters to other radio stations, asking them to ask listeners to express their opinions on immediately and fully adopting aid-China measures to Truman and Congress.

### The Legislative Yuan Will Convene Tomorrow; Only Three Items Will be Discussed

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 28th] The 24th meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held on the 30th. The agenda is as follows: Items for reporting include the Executive Yuan's inquiry as to (1) whether there are any difficulties in the implementation of the four specific standards of the Legislative Yuan regarding treaties, which is being researched by the Yuan for reply and review. (2) The reply to the inquiries of the members of this Yuan regarding the use of U.S. aid is requested for review.

(2) Draft Foreigner Lawyer Examination Regulations and Foreigner Accountant Examination Regulations. (3) Re-examination of the Draft Investigation Bureau Organization Regulations of the Ministry of Justice in conjunction with the Internal Affairs and Local Autonomy Committee.

### President Sun Yat-Sen Hosts Shanghai's Celebrities, Explaining the Importance of Suppressing the Rebellion, Hoping That Shanghai Citizens Will Rise Up to Save Themselves and Save the Country

[This Newspaper News] At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, President Sun Yat-Sen held a tea party at his official residence, inviting responsible persons of important social organizations and university presidents in this city. Those who were invited to attend included Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiguan, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Hongsheng, Cheng Cangbo, Jiang Yiping, Feng Youzhen, Xu Yongzuo, Zhou Xuexiang, Hu Dunfu, Zhang Yi, Hu Wenyao, Ouyuan Huai, Zhao Dihua, Chuan Mubo, Zhou Feicheng, Luo Dunwei, Cheng Shewo, Fan Zhengbo, Xu Kejun, Xu Xinyu, Ren Jinpin, Zhang Huiwen, and more than twenty others. They exchanged opinions frankly on current national affairs, and the meeting did not end until 5:30 PM. It is reported that President Sun Yat-Sen will be admitted to the hospital last night or this morning to treat his foot ailment, so his entry into Beijing to form a cabinet will inevitably have to wait for a few days.

At yesterday's tea party, President Sun Yat-Sen first explained that he was ordered to form a cabinet this time, but he could not refuse. He could only do his best for the country on the basis of cooperation with the people. The nature of the communist bandits' rebellion against the country and the government's suppression of the rebellion is by no means a partisan dispute or an ordinary civil war. It is actually an anti-aggression war to resist the Fifth Column of the Communist International. The life and death of the country and nation depend on it, and the people of the whole country and the government should share the responsibility. Shanghai's position is important, and the actions of its citizens are especially worthy of being an example for the whole country. Therefore, I am very willing to ask you for advice before taking office. In the past, the government may have had policy errors or low administrative efficiency, but in the future, it will humbly listen to the people's valuable opinions, reform the procedures of administrative organs, and strive to improve efficiency. The first is to strive for military victory, and the second is to relieve the suffering of the people. I deeply hope that you will also regard the government as the people's own government and wholeheartedly contribute your strength, which will surely achieve the effect of saving ourselves and saving the country. As for strengthening U.S. aid, it should not be a problem in principle. We only need to make efforts to help ourselves first and discuss specific methods with the United States in a frank and sincere spirit. At the same time, we can cooperate closely with the U.S. military advisors and the Economic Cooperation Administration, adopt their suggestions, make good use of their materials, and increase our work efficiency, which can make the U.S. government and people look at us with new eyes and be willing to strengthen their assistance. If the United States has any expectations of our country that we should and can do, we should quickly and earnestly implement them. For example: (1) The recommendations of the military advisory group should be implemented immediately if they are feasible, and the reasons should be explained if they are truly inconvenient to implement, so that they can understand. We only seek to strengthen U.S. aid and make the work of the advisory group more practical. (2) U.S. aid materials are shipped directly from U.S. ports to major coastal or Yangtze River ports in our country by foreign ships, and export materials are loaded and shipped directly to the U.S. at the unloading port when they return. This method saves time and labor, reduces transportation costs, and has a specific time limit. It is not used to transport goods and passengers between ports in our country, so there is no meaning of opening up inland river navigation rights. In the future, the government must act immediately on matters that are beneficial to the country and respect the reasonable opinions of the people. The government will never compromise with the communist bandits and will fight to the final victory. I deeply hope that the people of Shanghai will rise up automatically, contribute money and effort, and save themselves and save the country.

### Opinions of Pan Kung-chan and Others

Subsequently, Pan Kung-chan, Chien Hsin-chih, Tu Yueh-sheng, Chang Yi, Cheng Tsang-po, Liu Hongsheng, Hsu Chi-keng, Chiang Yi-ping, and Huan Yuan-huai, among others, successively expressed their opinions, which were all approved and adopted by President Sun. The main points are as follows: (1) It is hoped that the government will earnestly refresh its lineup and improve its policies, and especially establish a genuine foundation for a "responsible cabinet" in a constitutional country, to share the burden for the President, so that this progressive system can refresh the people's ears and eyes. (2) Under the principle of military first, thoroughly eradicate old malpractices, improve logistics operations, increase soldiers' treatment, and thoroughly reform the grain requisition and conscription systems in light of reality, to alleviate the suffering of farmers. (3) Quickly and universally implement land reform, gradually achieve equalization of land ownership, so that farmers can own their farmland. (4) Further express our country's firm anti-communist diplomatic stance in the international arena, quickly and diligently obtain US aid, and adopt foreign advisors' suggestions as much as possible. (5) The excessive control policies and economic police system in the economic field should be abolished immediately; there should be a clear boundary between state-owned enterprises and private enterprises, and "competing with the people for profit" should never be the goal of state-owned enterprises. (6) Improve the treatment of civil servants, thoroughly strengthen their efficiency, so that the efficiency of government agencies is the same as that of private industrial and commercial enterprises. (7) In the rear provinces and cities, private and foreign investment should be encouraged to engage in various productive enterprises, eliminating all unnecessary restrictions, in order to increase production and stabilize people's livelihood. (8) The people of Shanghai should stand on the position of supporting the government, strengthen their self-defense forces, maintain order, stabilize society, and work hard to relieve refugees and comfort soldiers and wounded soldiers.

### President Sun Ke Has a Tumor on His Left Leg; Surgery Will Be Performed Within Days

[This City News] President Sun Ke's visit to Shanghai this time is purely for medical treatment of his foot ailment. He developed a tumor on his left leg several weeks ago, and he intended to come to Shanghai to be hospitalized for surgery at that time, but ultimately, due to the many difficulties of the current situation and the burdens of government affairs, he had no time for it. Yesterday morning, Mr. Sun invited Mr. Shen Ke-fei, the president of Zhongshan Hospital and a famous surgeon, to his official residence for a consultation to discuss the matter of performing the surgery. It was originally scheduled to go to the hospital for surgery at 9:00 last night, but it did not happen due to some reason. Mr. Sun has now decided to be hospitalized for surgery within one or two days.

### Protest Against Siam's Restriction on Overseas Chinese Entering the Country

Just as Thailand is arresting overseas Chinese on a large scale and imposing all kinds of restrictions on overseas Chinese education and industrial and commercial activities, Siamese Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram suddenly announced the implementation of a "non-discriminatory immigration quota system," stipulating that starting next year, foreign immigrants will be limited to 200 people across the board. After the announcement of this new measure, our government immediately protested based on reason, and the overseas Chinese in Thailand also expressed dissatisfaction with this unreasonable restriction. Recently, the Siamese government decided to adopt the recommendation of the Immigration Special Committee of the Ministry of Interior, namely, to change the annual quota for Chinese immigrants to 500 people, in order to express its "concession." In fact, this method of restricting the entry of overseas Chinese is a bad measure that violates the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship and hinders the long-standing relations between China and Thailand. The implementation of this restrictive policy by the Plaek Phibunsongkhram government is a misjudgment on the part of Plaek Phibunsongkhram. Our public opinion not only wants to protest this unreasonable measure, but also to correct this misjudgment of Plaek Phibunsongkhram.

The historical relationship between China and Thailand has lasted for 1,600 years. The old friendship between China and Thailand is peaceful and courteous. This is clearly recorded in the history of China and Thailand and is well-documented. In recent times, the relationship between China and Thailand has been isolated and unfriendly. This was all caused by Plaek Phibunsongkhram single-handedly, to the point of being irreparable. Before the war, Plaek Phibunsongkhram used anti-Chinese sentiment as a rallying cry, which plunged Thailand's national fortune into a tragic abyss. After the war, the Allied Powers did not settle Plaek Phibunsongkhram's war criminal suspicions, allowing him to regain his conscious reason and become a good person again. After the "January 18th" incident last year, Plaek Phibunsongkhram regained control of the military and then replaced Khuang Aphaiwong's regime with a "bloodless revolution." After Plaek Phibunsongkhram came to power, he relapsed into his old ways. In particular, his anti-Chinese policies were performed most brilliantly. First, the Siamese government closed overseas Chinese schools, banned the hanging of the Chinese national flag, restricted overseas Chinese children from receiving education from their motherland, and imposed various restrictions on overseas Chinese teachers. After the start of the autumn semester this year, 4,000 overseas Chinese children returned to China to study. Although all 500 overseas Chinese schools in Thailand have now been allowed to open, there are many technical problems, which is equivalent to not being able to operate them. Secondly, regarding the restrictions on overseas Chinese engaging in industrial and commercial activities, the Siamese Democratic Party drafted a plan to restrict the free development of overseas Chinese, the form of which is very similar to that previously formulated by the Philippines. The plan stipulates that overseas Chinese shops and warehouses must hire Siamese people as deputy managers, and the number of Siamese people employed must not be less than 50%. Thirdly, the number of "bad elements" among overseas Chinese who have been arrested is also astonishing. Sixty-three people were arrested on June 15 alone, and 52 people were deported. On August 10, about 300 people were arrested, plunging the 3 million overseas Chinese in Thailand into a state of panic and uncertainty.

Implemented at the same time as the above-mentioned anti-Chinese measures is the restriction on the entry of overseas Chinese. In August of this year, a new harsh regulation was promulgated to increase the deportation of overseas Chinese, stipulating that 30 types of occupations would be banned, causing some overseas Chinese to be forced to leave the country. The Siamese government believes that restricting the occupations of overseas Chinese is not enough, and recently promulgated an immigration quota system, restricting the entry of overseas Chinese to a maximum of 500 people per year. This is undoubtedly an unreasonable and unilateral regulation. It is reported that our government has lodged representations with the Siamese government. Standing on the position of friendly relations between China and Thailand, in addition to protesting this unprecedented immigration restriction policy, we also hope to correct this misjudgment of Plaek Phibunsongkhram from the perspective of human reason.

First, the founding of Siam is closely and significantly related to the entry of overseas Chinese. In the past, Siam was a desolate place. Overseas Chinese prospered Siam's industry and commerce and opened up vast agricultural land. The modern history of Siam is full of the blood and tears of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese have never asked for political rewards. The Siamese people have Chinese blood, but overseas Chinese have insulted their descendants since childhood. In short, the 3 million overseas Chinese are kind people. They live passively and only seek to live and work in peace and contentment, without any sense of superiority. They need a sense of security for survival and freedom in life. This depends on the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship to guarantee it, and the rationality of Siamese politicians to guarantee it.

Second, before the establishment of modern Sino-Siamese relations, Chinese people entered Siam freely. In recent times, this free entry has been restricted, but the scale of the restrictions should be relaxed to be considered a reasonable restriction and a restriction that does not violate reason. According to statistics from the ten years before the war (i.e., 1927 to 1936), the average annual number of Chinese people entering Siam exceeded the number of people leaving Siam by about 18,000. After the war, our ambassador to Thailand, Li Tieh-cheng, and Siamese Prime Minister Khuang Aphaiwong agreed that the future quota should be based on the average population of the 15 years from 1927 to 1941, stipulating that 14,000 Chinese people could enter Siam each year. This is a common code of conduct for China and Thailand and does not become invalid due to the change of the Siamese regime. Therefore, the regulation of the Plaek Phibunsongkhram government that restricts the number to 500 people is very unreasonable. If the Siamese government breaks its previous promise and violates diplomatic norms, what good-neighborly relations can there be between countries in the future? This point needs the special vigilance and caution of the Siamese government.

We point out the above two points, hoping that the Siamese government will accept our well-intentioned advice; at the same time, we call on our government to pay attention to diplomacy with Thailand. In the past, diplomacy with Thailand was too perfunctory, causing overseas Chinese to suffer. It is extremely sad to say. Our people are filled with grief and indignation at the plight of overseas Chinese in Thailand, and we hope that the government will take action quickly, in addition to protesting, to correct the misjudgment of the Siamese government.

### Continue to Work Hard to Wipe Out the Bandits! Liu Chih Sends a Letter to Thank the慰劳団 The Entire Body of Soldiers of Qiu's Corps Also Sends a Letter to Express Their Gratitude

[Central News Agency Xuzhou 28th] Liu Chih, Commander-in-Chief of the Xuzhou Bandit Suppression Headquarters, sent a letter of thanks to the First and Second 慰劳团 for coming to Xuzhou from afar and donating a large number of慰劳goods to encourage the morale of the front lines and comfort the wounded soldiers.

We are honored to have you come together to represent the people of the rear and extend your sincere condolences. Both the material and spiritual aspects are perfect. However, defending the country is the duty of soldiers. Achieving victory depends on the cooperation of all sectors. In addition to our gratitude, we are even more ashamed. Thinking of the treacherous bandits and international conspiracies, the hatred is so great that the whole country is indignant. We are fighting for anti-aggression and it concerns the survival of the nation. We should be of one heart and one mind, continue to work hard, wipe out the bandit scourge, and permanently secure China.

We are grateful to you for braving the cold and coming from afar to visit our corps and bring us warmth and generous rewards. This proves that the people in the rear are with us." It also said: "We believe that the people in the rear must realize the truth that there will be no intact eggs under an overturned nest. Under the supreme policy of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, they will support the government and work together to promote the implementation of the overall war."

### The Executive Yuan Plans to Improve the Treatment of Public School Teachers in Another Way Many Legislators Express Dissatisfaction

Said It Does Not Conform to the Provisions of the Constitution

### Enhance Coal Sources in Central and Southern China The Three Coal Mines in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong Formulate Production Goals and Actively Develop Equipment

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 28th Electric] The Resources Committee believes that the coal used in the Beijing-Shanghai area and South China mostly relies on the supply of the Kailuan, Huadong, and Huainan mines. However, the transportation problem of transporting coal from the north to the south is not easy to solve. Now, the committee has set the construction of coal mines in Central and Southern China as its central task for the future. Among them, the quality of the three mines in Ganxi (i.e., Pingxiang), Huxiang, and Nanling is good. In recent years, human and material resources have been concentrated to focus on development, and American experts have been hired to conduct on-site surveys and assist in planning, and to formulate the ultimate production goals. Ganxi will produce 4,500 tons per day, Huxiang will produce 2,500 tons, and Nanling will produce 500 tons. The entire plan is scheduled to be completed in three years.

Ganxi

Ganxi has Anyuan and Gaokeng mines under its jurisdiction. Anyuan is reorganizing and expanding the old mines, and plans to produce 1,000 tons per day in the future. Gaokeng is a new factory, and plans to produce 3,500 tons of coal per day. There is now a branch line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway that directly reaches the factory. The two new large mines that the factory has dug are each more than 800 feet deep, and the main coal seams can be seen. It is planned that the latest method will be used to mine coal from these two wells. The power plant built this year has completed a capacity of 1,000 kilowatts and has already generated electricity. There is still 3,000 kilowatts of equipment that is being installed and is expected to be completed within next year. In addition, in order to meet future needs, it is planned to add 10,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment. The remaining mining, repair, washing, and other equipment materials have been proposed in the US aid plan. If they can be gradually realized, the coal source in Central China will not only be enhanced in the future, but it can also be used as a model mine to train technical personnel.

Huxiang

The Huxiang Coal Mine currently uses self-built roads to transport coal, and the output is limited. In the future, a large amount of coal will be produced, and the repair of the Hunan-Guizhou Railway is urgently needed. The strata in the mining area contain a lot of water, and the existing equipment is limited. The factory has adopted electric drainage, and the power source is temporarily supplied by the Xiangmei Power Plant. In the future, a large increase in production will require the cooperation of US aid equipment.

Nanling

The production plan for Nanling is 500 tons per day. The current maximum daily output is 160 tons. After the completion and opening of the Nanling branch line of the Guangdong-Han Railway next spring, it is planned to gradually expand to 400 tons. If the source of funds is guaranteed and the project is advanced on schedule, the output can reach 500 tons per day in the 39th year. In the future, it should be expanded again to 1,000 tons per day depending on the needs.

Construction Scheduled to Begin Next Spring

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 28th] The Wengjiang Hydropower Project has recently had personnel jointly dispatched by the National Resources Commission (NRC) and the Guangdong Provincial Government to survey the dam site, and construction is scheduled to begin next spring. This project is of great importance to the development of industry and agriculture in South China. Before and during the war, Siemens Corporation, the NRC Hydropower Development, and the Surveying Corps conducted research on it. After the war, the National Hydropower Engineering Administration dispatched a team to plan it. Mr. Gordon, former chief engineer of the U.S. Federal Power Commission and hydropower engineer for the NRC, also studied it. From five planned locations, the Youshukeng site was selected as the plant site. Initially, it is planned to install two 20,000-kilowatt generators, with an initial total capacity of 90,000 kilowatts. In the second phase, two more 20,000-kilowatt generators will be added, generating a total of 80,000 kilowatts. After the plan is completed, electricity can be transmitted to Guangzhou. The entire project is expected to take about five years to complete. The generating machinery will all come from the United States, requiring US$3,931,000 in foreign exchange. Other domestically produced materials and labor costs will total approximately 18.5 million Gold Yuan.

### U.S. Must Adopt Effective Measures to Change the Situation in China; Reforms Should Be Implemented Later: A Just Argument from Renowned San Francisco Columnist Lawrence

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 27th] Renowned San Francisco Oakland Tribune columnist Lawrence recently wrote an article in the newspaper on November 24th, entitled: "China in the Short Term and Long Term." The gist of it is: "After listening to several university professors discuss the Chinese crisis for several hours, I immediately swept away the pessimistic ideas. We must put our heart and soul into thinking about this problem. The deductions of academics, no matter how intellectually fascinating, are of no great help in dealing with the current situation. Most of us cannot distinguish between China's short-term and long-term goals. Americans have discussed the Communist Party's influence on agricultural areas, and the factional struggles and corruption in Chinese politics, but they are all half-truths and may not be entirely correct. Some of them are forcing them to conform to the facts out of preconceived notions, and others are measuring China's situation with their own American experience. We do not deny that China urgently needs social and economic reforms, but we must recognize the significant impact of the eight-year war of resistance against Japan, and the tremendous pressure currently exerted by fighting the Communist Party. This long-term conflict should also include the war against Japan in the Northeast, which began in 1931. Impatient and overly idealistic Americans often fail to consider the short history of Chinese nationalism's development, and the fluctuations caused by the influence of Western industrialism and cultural thought in China. China will not suddenly change again with innovation, and the future new China will not be completely the same as Western countries. The new China will be a mixture of old and new forces, just like how barbarian peoples, Roman culture, and Christian churches created a brand new civilization. This is a slow and step-by-step historical process, and reforms to promote this process will become a long-term plan. But the current problem is of a short-term nature, and its purpose must be to preserve the various conditions that allow China to be free. Lawrence continued to discuss the Communist Party's plan, the similarities between the Chinese Communist Party and Marxists, and the relationship between Mao Zedong and the Cominform. He said: No matter what concessions the Chinese Communist Party may be forced to make to the domestic situation, their direction towards the goal of world communism will not be affected. And these two points are the main concerns of the United States, which will threaten our security in the Pacific region. This must be the basis of our short-term policy. Any reforms we can encourage or support must be implemented later. What must be done first is to put out the raging fire. We can take some effective and immediate military measures to change the current situation in China, and if China agrees, we can at least take an economic measure. Our economic experts estimate that if Chinese bankers cooperate with our experts, only a relatively small sum of money is needed to stabilize Chinese currency, which can have a great impact on China's economy. The above are only short-term measures and are not intended to solve China's problems. Their purpose is only to maintain the various conditions that allow China to decide its own destiny."

### UN Resolution Demands Southern Balkans Stop Aiding Greek Guerrillas, Resolve Outstanding Issues Peacefully

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] The United Nations General Assembly today discussed the Greek issue in detail and approved the recommendations passed by the Political Committee. The General Assembly approved the joint proposal of the United States, Britain, France, and China by a vote of 47 to 6 (Slavic countries), and rejected the Soviet proposal to withdraw foreign troops stationed in Greece and reduce the powers of the Balkan Committee by a vote of 47 to 6. The proposal put forward by the United States, Britain, France, and China demanded that Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria immediately cease aiding Greek guerrillas, cooperate with the Greek government to resolve outstanding issues between countries peacefully, and do their best to assist the work of the United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee. The United Nations General Assembly also unanimously passed some clauses of the Soviet proposal, requesting Greece, Albania, and Bulgaria to establish diplomatic relations, and requiring the four governments to resolve border and refugee issues in a spirit of mutual understanding. At the afternoon meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, French Foreign Minister Schuman said that the French government agreed with the four governments' proposal on the Greek issue. Schuman strongly argued that the United Nations should not interfere in Greece's internal affairs. U.S. representative Dulles then spoke, saying that the United States fully supported the report of the Balkan Committee and hoped that the negotiations between Greece and its northern neighbors, currently chaired by Ivatt and Lie, could be successful. Ukrainian representative Manuilsky criticized Britain and the United States for interfering in Greece's internal affairs and supported the Soviet proposal for the immediate withdrawal of foreign troops. The UN General Assembly finally unanimously passed a recommendation that Greek children currently abroad should have the opportunity to return to Greece immediately.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 27th] Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu spoke in support of most of the proposals on the Greek issue. He warned the United Nations General Assembly to pay attention to the danger of "indirect aggression," saying that this is where the core of the world peace problem lies. Jiang said, "The most pressing issue facing the world today is not direct aggression but indirect aggression."

### Berlin City Elections to Be Held as Scheduled, The Shadow of East-West Division Is Inevitable, British Side Denies West Germany is Training Militias

[United Press, Berlin, 28th] The Berlin municipal election will begin on December 5th, and over a million Germans will participate in the vote, which will affect the whole world, as it is a struggle between Soviet totalitarianism and Western democracy. After the election, Berlin may be formally split into two cities. The Soviet Union has banned voting in its territory, so only Germans within the British, American, and French sectors will participate.

Franklyn, Political Chief of the U.S. Military Government, said: "The election makes the Soviet Union very unhappy. The Soviet Union understands the anti-Soviet sentiment of Berlin citizens, so it will never politically commit suicide by allowing a free vote." The purpose of the election is to elect city councilors. Originally, it was only necessary to elect less than 30 seats, but due to the Soviet boycott, it is planned to elect 98 people. The West believes that every person who votes is one more person against Soviet-style totalitarianism. If the weather is good, officials estimate that 85 percent of citizens will participate in the vote, about 1.5 million people. If the weather is bad, the number will be greatly affected. West Berlin police will be deployed, especially in areas bordering the East, but it is not expected that there will be systematic communist riots. To date, five municipal departments have been forced to move from the Soviet sector to West Berlin. Western officials believe that the Soviet Union will force every institution to withdraw when the voting is completed. A few days ago, German police in the Soviet zone surrounded the city hall and prevented documents from being moved out. The three major anti-communist parties are campaigning quietly, and the Soviet Union is obstructing Germans from voting in thousands of ways.

[United Press, Berlin, 27th] According to the British-registered news agency, Marshal Sokolovsky, commander-in-chief of the Soviet occupation forces in Germany, convened a meeting of senior officials to discuss the establishment of a separate municipal government in the Soviet sector of Berlin. According to the agency, this information comes from well-informed sources close to the Soviet military government, saying that Sokolovsky has ordered the Berlin City Council to move out of the City Hall building in the Soviet sector before the October 5th city election. However, Allied officials have not confirmed the news that the Soviet Union will establish a separate municipal government in the Soviet sector after December 5th or even before. According to the German news agency registered in the U.S., the Soviet military court sentenced Dr. McKenbock, chairman of the Berlin Coal Rationing Committee, to three months and twenty-five days in prison for disobeying the Soviet authorities. The term began on August 1st, so McKenbock was released on the 27th. At the same time, the Soviet occupation forces' newspaper, "Daily Review," insisted that if the United States continues to adhere to its current foreign policy, it "will inevitably lead to a new war."

[Agence France-Presse, Düsseldorf, 27th] A British military spokesman in the Rhineland today denied the German writer Kang Gang's statement that the British and American authorities are establishing a German national army in West Germany. According to Kang Gang, the training of this militia began nine months ago. The British military spokesman completely denied this. He also said that the British military authorities have never considered training German youth. After Kang Gang's sensational remarks were published, there was much discussion in the streets and alleys here. Kang Gang said that the British and American authorities are planning to rebuild the West German army in response to the Soviet Union's establishment of a strong police force in its occupation zone. The Christian Democratic Union's "Rheinische Post" said that rebuilding the West German army would be like playing with fire. Although the West German army could strengthen our international position, we believe that if Germany must participate in another war, Germany should participate on an equal footing. Otherwise, the trained German youth will become mercenaries hired by others. If the German national army defends the Rhineland, then German youth will undoubtedly be sacrificed as cannon fodder.

### Five Western European Countries Have Drafted the Atlantic Treaty

Rumored to Be Valid for 50 Years

[Agence France-Presse, London, 27th] According to semi-official sources, the Permanent Commission of the Five Brussels Treaty countries has drafted the Atlantic Treaty. The draft will be immediately submitted to the governments of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Qualified observers expect that the five governments will approve it, and after the five governments approve it, the ambassadors of the five countries to the United States and the Canadian ambassador to the United States will submit it to the U.S. State Department. Officials here refused to disclose the contents of the draft treaty, but some reports say that the draft provisions include France's proposal stipulating that the treaty is valid for 50 years. Informed sources also said that the meeting between the Brussels Treaty and the seven countries of the United States and Canada may be held in Washington in half a month to continue discussing the draft Atlantic Treaty.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] The Standing Committee of the European Federation, composed of the five signatory countries of the Brussels Treaty, held its founding ceremony in Paris yesterday and convened its second meeting today to discuss work procedures.

### Yoshida and Tokyo District Prosecutor Demand Arrest of Hitoshi Ashida, The Showa Denko Scandal Has Taken a Sudden Turn

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Prime Minister Yoshida met with Speaker Matsuoka of the House of Representatives in the Speaker's office on the 28th, requesting the House to order the arrest of former Democratic Party President Hitoshi Ashida.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 28th] The Tokyo District Prosecutor requested the parliament on the 28th to allow the arrest of former Prime Minister and Democratic Party leader Hitoshi Ashida. Ashida's cabinet was forced to resign on October 7 after two of its cabinet members, Nishio of the Socialist Party and Kurisu of the Democratic Party, were arrested for involvement in the Showa Denko bribery case.

Informed sources at the time said that Hinohara, the manager of Showa Denko, misused over $2 million in public funds. It was rumored that Ashida had received a bribe of 1 million yen (approximately over $30,000). Ashida's private secretary was arrested some time ago, which at the time led some observers to believe that Ashida's arrest was imminent. However, because the prosecutor handled the case extremely slowly and very cautiously, fearing that it would affect the Democratic Party leader before the election, it has not been implemented. However, today there has been a sudden turn for the worse. The prosecutor today requested the parliament to allow the arrest of Ashida himself and two other members, Kita and Kawahashi, because the parliament is currently in session and members enjoy privileges.

### Soviets Building Large Airport North of Vladivostok

Cannot Be Destroyed by Atomic Bombs

[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] According to the Sunday News of the World, the Soviet Union is building an airport that cannot be destroyed by atomic bombs in the Siberian grassland north of Vladivostok. It is said that 80 aircraft can take off simultaneously at this airport, and it can accommodate 2,400 military aircraft.

### Japan to Draft New Laws to Prevent Communist Party Activities

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] A person close to the Japanese cabinet informed the Central News Agency today that the Japanese government has recently completed a draft of a new law granting officials of the Special Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Justice broad discretionary powers to investigate and arrest subversives without restriction. The person also said that this new law will expand the scope of the Bureau's activities to include the investigation and prevention of Communist Party or left-leaning activities. According to current laws, the task of the Investigation Bureau is mainly limited to the preventative or cautionary investigation of right-leaning militant groups or extremist nationalist groups and their activities, and to investigate the activities of purged individuals and former military officers. However, the new law stipulates that 365 officials of the Special Investigation Bureau will be permitted to investigate, search, or arrest suspects of subversive acts, to be handled at the discretion of each official.

It is learned that Imperial Ordinance No. 101, on which the Bureau officials base their activities, requires them to obtain an arrest warrant from the Ministry of Justice before taking any action. The new law stipulates that this procedure is not necessary. According to the reliable source, the Bureau officials have long felt the need to have discretionary power to immediately search, seize, or detain. It is said that it is not uncommon for suspects of subversive activities to destroy evidence or even escape during the time it takes to issue an arrest warrant. It is also said that the reason for expanding the Bureau's task to investigate left-leaning individuals, just as right-leaning individuals are investigated, is because "Communist Party malfeasance has increased." It is pointed out that in the past three years, the occupation forces and the Japanese government have been strict and precise in suppressing and eradicating right-leaning groups, but there has been little active action against left-leaning individuals, resulting in greater freedom and impunity, which has completely broken the balance between the two extremes, and the position of the left-leaning forces has increased daily. The new law will also force a large number of various associations and companies to register with the Ministry of Justice. Currently, the number of registered associations is about 4,500, which are mainly organizations engaged in political activities. This law requires cultural and economic organizations, even those with slight political overtones, to register like fully political organizations, and the number of registrations will increase to over 10,000.

### Japanese Cabinet Rushes to Compile Budget After Allied GHQ Instruction

Struggle Between Ruling and Opposition Parties Still Unresolved

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] The deadlock in the Japanese Diet over the amendment to the Civil Service Law, after MacArthur Headquarters hinted that it was inseparable from the supplementary budget bill, Prime Minister Yoshida has ordered the Ministry of Finance to rush to compile the supplementary budget. However, the passage of this bill and the budget bill cannot be considered as a solution to tomorrow's political struggle. On the contrary, a fierce political struggle will begin in three or four days. Regarding the issue of deliberating the budget bill, Chief Cabinet Secretary Sato told reporters: "The submission and discussion of this budget bill is entirely a matter of political relations. Although there are only two days left for discussion, it is not without hope of passing."

A Great Victory for the Queuille Government

In officially announcing the end of the strike, the union said that it must "reorganize its forces to continue the fight in other areas." It also said: "This struggle is by no means in vain. If we surrender without resistance, it will cause a serious mistake." Approximately 350,000 coal miners were on strike, and France lost 5 million tons of coal. The government was forced to divert oil and other funds to purchase and import emergency coal. The collapse of the strike is a great victory for the Queuille government.

### Grain and Agriculture Conference to Close Today; Far East Representatives Suggest Re-electing Six Member Nations of the Committee on Policies to Rescue Food Production

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th (Associated Press)] Far East representatives attending the World Food and Agriculture Organization conference here feel that international financial organizations should consider how to exert their best efforts to resolve the financial situation that hinders food production and affects the livelihoods of millions of people. It is reliably learned that the Far East Committee's report will include this suggestion. The World Food and Agriculture Organization General Assembly will take action on the Far East Committee's report, completed this week, at a meeting before the General Assembly concludes on the 29th. Representatives from Far Eastern countries stated that member nations of the World Food and Agriculture Organization and international financial organizations must immediately consider the purchasing difficulties caused by the lack of funds in various countries, and the so-called foreign exchange chaos in various countries.

Australia's representative, Bruce, was re-elected chairman of the committee by voice vote. The collective re-election of the six countries, including Australia and Denmark, today met with opposition and criticism from smaller countries such as Czechoslovakia, Greece, Pakistan, and the Philippines. These countries believe that the members of the committee should be rotated among the countries according to regulations.

### Britain and America Guarantee France Against German Aggression Again

[Associated Press, London, 28th] An official stated on the 28th that the dispute between France and the United States and Britain over the control of German heavy industry in the Ruhr area "can be resolved within a considerable period of time." He stated that France's request for appropriate guarantees to prevent the Ruhr area from being used for war preparations again can certainly be satisfied by the United States and Britain. He stated, "The United States and Britain have absolutely no intention of allowing Germany to rearm and threaten France again, so they will provide the greatest guarantees." However, the official did not mention what the so-called "security guarantees" would be. It is generally believed that even after the conclusion of the peace treaty with Germany and the withdrawal of most of the occupying forces, the Allied forces will still occupy some key areas of Germany. It is reported that France insists on continuing the occupation, claiming that this is part of the agreement reached by the three countries in June.

### Fifty German War Criminals to be Executed This Year

MacArthur again rejected reporters' requests to visit the execution on the 27th. Aegis insisted that even he himself has not yet learned the scheduled time of the execution, and the name of the "military representative" making preparations for the execution is still being kept top secret.

### The Four Powers are Deadlocked on the Berlin Issue; Neutral Countries Attempt a Final Effort

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia continued his private talks today in a final effort to find a way to break the deadlock in Berlin. Bramuglia met with Soviet representative Jessup this afternoon and hopes to visit Soviet representative Vyshinsky tonight or tomorrow morning, and also plans to meet with French representative Parodi and British representative Meidegan.

[Associated Press, Paris, 28th] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Thorp declared at a press conference on the 28th that the United States is still willing to negotiate the withdrawal of the Deutsche Mark issued by the West from Berlin, but only after the Soviet Union lifts the blockade of Berlin. At the same time, a senior U.S. official warned that if the Berlin crisis cannot be resolved immediately, there may be no hope of resolution in a few days. Security Council Chairman Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia is making a final attempt to draft a compromise plan that can be accepted by the three Western countries and the Soviet Union before his term as chairman expires on the 30th. However, his efforts seem doomed to failure. The West believes that an agreement may not be possible until the Soviet Union stops its movement to split the city of Berlin and all parties begin to unify the Berlin municipal administration. Thorp stated that the rumors that the United States has withdrawn from the decision to use the four-power agreement of August 30 in Moscow as the basis for negotiations are not true. The four-power agreement recognizes the Deutsche Mark issued by the Soviet Union as the only currency in Berlin, and the Soviet Union lifts the blockade of Berlin. The details are then handed over to the four-power military governors for discussion. Afterwards, the governors' meeting broke up unhappily. Thorp admitted that the United States and Britain may have slight differences of opinion on the solution to the currency issue, but there is absolutely no fundamental split. A senior Western official stated that the Berlin situation is deteriorating rapidly. If it cannot be resolved immediately, Berlin will inevitably be divided into two. He also said that although the West still believes that an agreement can be reached, if the status quo does not change, there is no hope that the Soviet Deutsche Mark will ever become the only currency in Berlin.

### Britain, America, and France Hold Behind-the-Scenes Discussions on the Disposition of Former Italian Colonies

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 27th] British and American representatives, as well as representatives from France and other countries, are currently discussing the issue of former Italian colonies behind the scenes at the United Nations General Assembly. Britain and the United States agree that the former Italian colonies should be placed under United Nations trusteeship, and request that Britain administer Cyrenaica on their behalf. Italy would administer Italian Somaliland. France has expressed opposition to the decision of Abyssinia to administer Eritrea on their behalf. Due to the Arab demand for the independence of Tripolitania, Britain and the United States have not yet made a decision on the disposition of the area. In view of the fact that the current session of the United Nations General Assembly will soon end, the issue of Italian colonies may be reserved for discussion at a special session of the United Nations General Assembly next spring.

### Private Primary and Secondary School Teachers Decide to Resume Teaching Today; Officially Return to Work After Living Standards Are Guaranteed

[Report from this newspaper] The Liaison Association of Private Secondary School Teachers in this city held a meeting of representatives from various schools yesterday afternoon, resolving to temporarily resume work starting today and to officially return to work after living standards are guaranteed. The meeting also resolved that regarding the increase in tuition fees for private schools this time, the mayor has approved the collection of one to three times the original amount. Schools that have already overcharged should have the principals return the overcharged amount to the students. At the same time, the Liaison Association of Private Primary School Teachers also held a meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday morning, deciding to accept the mayor's advice and temporarily resume work starting today. However, regarding the issue of in-kind rations, it was decided to send representatives to strongly fight for this with the authorities, believing that there should be no distinction between public and private school teachers in enjoying rations.

[Another report] The distribution of woolen yarn to private schools began on the 27th. Secondary schools have already received it, and primary schools and vocational schools will complete the process within the next month.

In addition, private primary and secondary school teacher's union employee's direct family member investigation forms should be filled out in duplicate again according to the original format and sent to the Personnel Office of the Education Bureau for application.

### Various Sectors Express Dissatisfaction with Private Schools Increasing Tuition Fees; Will Jointly File a Protest

Since the teachers of private secondary schools in this city used the method of a general leave of absence to obtain the approval of Mayor Wu to increase the second tuition fee by one to three times in various private primary and secondary schools, it has already aroused dissatisfaction and resentment among the majority of people from all walks of life, including parents of various schools and senators. They believe that the principals can only ask the students and alumni for subsidies, or solicit donations from the students' parents in the name of "respecting teachers," but they cannot make mandatory regulations. Moreover, according to the provisions of the Civil Code, after the students' parents agree to the fees stipulated in the private school's charter and pay them at one time, it is tantamount to the establishment of a "contract" agreed upon by both parties. The schools cannot refuse the "contract" that has been agreed upon and fulfilled for any reason, and collect a second tuition fee. The third party administrative authority cannot interfere or change the "contract" that has been agreed upon by both parties by order. Therefore, several senators and people's organizations will jointly file a protest with Mayor Wu to oppose this illegal measure taken by the government and various private primary and secondary schools.

### Senator Jiang Submits Interpellations and Asks the Mayor to Answer Eight Points

City Senator Jiang Huaisu issued a statement yesterday saying; after reading the report on the 26th of this month that Mayor Wu rejected the four demands of private schools, it can be said to be legal and reasonable, but after a day, the report on the 27th stated that Mayor Wu convened a meeting of private school principals and indicated that it could be increased by one to three times. Because these are all news reports, it is not certain whether this is true. I can only ask the mayor to explain the following interpellations in detail:

(1) When the autumn semester began this year, the calculation of tuition fees was based on the prices at the time, calculated at one time, which was enough for half a year, and poor parents requested to pay in two installments, which the schools absolutely refused to do, so I don't know how many people dropped out of school? Now the schools say that there is not enough expenditure, and the teachers say that they cannot live. Should this responsibility be borne by the parents?

(2) The gold yuan coupons paid by parents this semester are worth one tael of gold, which is exchanged for 200 gold yuan coupons. The price limit is from August 19 to October 31, which is also a long period of 74 days. Why did the principals and teachers have no planned use for half a year's expenses and living expenses? If it is said that it is because the gold yuan coupons have depreciated, please ask who is responsible for the depreciation of the gold yuan coupons, and who should be asked for compensation.

(3) Historically, schools have charged fees once per semester, so principals can refuse parents' requests to pay in installments. If a second addition is allowed this time, will this precedent be opened, and will there be three or four additions in the future, or once or twice a month, because prices are constantly changing.

(4) The tuition fee can be added a second time this year. Will the tuition fee be handled as usual next year? Will parents be allowed to pay in installments in the future?

(5) On what kind of educational laws is the additional tuition fee based? Does the government have the right to approve this kind of forced parents to be non-obligatory and non-responsible ancestors?

(6) If parents cannot afford to pay due to financial difficulties, or are unwilling to pay because of the dignity of respecting the contractual behavior stipulated in the law, does the government also allow schools to expel students from school?

(7) Schools have a board of directors. Now that the board of directors does not bear the school's finances, what is the use of this name? It can be replaced by the general assembly of all parents. Please explain the responsibilities of the board of directors and the future handling of the board of directors.

(8) Schools can violate contractual behavior and add tuition fees. Can stores also force employers to increase prices for losses on orders? The government should be impartial to the people, and agriculture, industry, commerce, and academia should be treated equally. Huaisu does not sympathize with the school's collection of the second tuition fee, but she sympathizes with the poverty of the teachers. Therefore, she suggests that it is best to use the name of "Winter Relief Fund for Poor Teachers," if the teachers are unwilling to accept relief, then they might as well still take the old path of "respecting teachers," and the Education Bureau should jointly organize an expanded fundraising campaign with the City Council Education Group and the Teachers' Union. Because it is mandatory to be borne by the parents, then who will bear the burden if the parents cannot afford it? My humble opinion is like this, please ask the mayor to explain?

### The Price of Rice Rationing in November Will Be Decided by a Three-Person Group Tomorrow

The distribution of household rice rationing certificates for November in this city has begun in various districts. The rice rationing has been rushed to be transported and there is sufficient preparation. It has been decided to ration it on the 5th of next month. Regarding the issue of rice rationing prices, the three-person negotiation method will still be adopted. Mayor Wu will meet with representatives of the Ministry of Food and representatives of the Shanghai Branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration tomorrow afternoon at the Municipal Government to negotiate, which can be announced immediately. It is reported that this price negotiation is quite difficult to resolve. The opinion of the People's Livelihood Association is that it cannot be based on 95% of the market price as the standard.

It is also learned that after this city replaced the new national identity cards, there are still people who have moved their household registration and have not received them. After applying for a replacement identity card for these household registrations, they can make a supplementary application to receive rice rationing certificates.

### The Review Committee for the Cost of Living Index for the Second Half of the Month Will Be Announced Tomorrow; The Main Daily Necessities Will Be Calculated Based on Market Prices

The cost of living index for employees in the second half of this month will be discussed and approved by the Review Committee at the Municipal Government tomorrow morning for announcement. Representatives from the City Council, the City Chamber of Commerce, the City Industrial Association, and the City Federation of Trade Unions will all participate. The reason for this employee index is that the main daily necessities for the expanded rationing for employees in November, Zhu Neng, will be distributed as scheduled, so the main daily necessities included in the index are all calculated based on the average market price of the past half month.

### Trade Unions That Have Not Been Reorganized According to Law Have Been Ordered to Dissolve by the Social Affairs Bureau; New and Old Directors and Supervisors Should Go Through Handover Procedures

Of the trade unions in this city that have been reorganized according to the new Trade Union Law and the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Trade Union Law, there are a total of 269 units so far. However, some trade unions, such as the ebony furniture industry, the oil industry, and the rickshaw industry, cannot be reorganized because the members are scattered. The Social Affairs Bureau has ordered them to dissolve, and all properties, documents, etc. should be handed over to the City Federation of Trade Unions for receipt. As for the other trade unions that have completed the reorganization, but the new and old directors and supervisors have not gone through the handover procedures in accordance with the law, the Social Affairs Bureau has ordered them to comply within ten days of receiving the document and submit a list for reporting.

Now, because Mrs. Chen Wang Yunmo insisted on giving up in order to abide by Mr. Chen's last words of thin funeral and thin burial, each of the organizations decided to cancel the memorial service.

### The Two Bureaus Conduct a General Survey and Strictly Ban Illegal Buildings in Public Places

The Municipal Bureau of Public Works will join forces with the Police Bureau within days to conduct a general survey of illegal buildings in public places. If they are found, they will be immediately ordered to change the police. According to a person in charge of the Bureau of Public Works, the construction years of public places vary and there is no fixed standard. Recently, there have been many unauthorized changes and additions, so it is necessary to strictly enforce the law. They will be ordered to immediately suspend business. Now, in order to show concern for the difficulties of merchants, the public places with illegal buildings will be ordered to demolish or improve them immediately. It has also been decided that in the future, for public places to obtain licenses, the Bureau of Public Works must first review the construction situation to see if it meets the regulations before the Police Bureau issues a permit.

### The Head of Xincheng District Resigns; Zhou Chunfang is Presumed to Succeed

Wang Jian'e, the head of Xincheng District in this city, resigned as a candidate for the Legislative Yuan. The vacancy was taken over by Chen Yu, the deputy head of the district.

### The Quotas of Medicines for the Seventh and Eighth Seasons Will Still Be Distributed According to the Original Proportion

Regarding the issue of raw material imports under the quota system for the seventh and eighth seasons, the pharmaceutical industry previously requested an increase in the proportion to 75%. To this end, the Export-Import Control Commission invited the responsible persons of the Municipal Health Bureau, the pharmaceutical industry, and the Western medicine group of the import and export industry to discuss the matter. It is learned that the result is still to maintain the original proportion, that is, the pharmaceutical industry and import and export merchants each have a distribution proportion of 50%. However, those in the industry who have previously had qualified buying household qualifications can still order goods from importers, but the amount must be deducted from the industrial quota portion. It is said that the manufacturers in the industry are deeply dissatisfied with this decision and intend to appeal to the Export-Import Control Commission to redistribute it.

### In Order to Save the Industrial Crisis, Please Open Up Industrial Loans as Soon as Possible; Resolution of the Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors of the Municipal Industrial Association

The Shanghai Municipal Industrial Association believes that the situation of the industrial sector is becoming more and more difficult, such as raw materials, electricity, working capital, and wages, which are under heavy pressure, while domestic sales areas are decreasing day by day, and foreign purchasing power is gradually shrinking.

### Market Prices of Woolen Fabrics After Currency Reform

After the currency reform in August and the use of gold yuan coupons, the prices of woolen fabrics generally fell within the first week, but soon continued to rise. As a buying frenzy began, stores were emptied by狂购, and the best goods were mostly hidden. The price limit was changed to negotiated price, and then from negotiated price to free bidding, which caused the black market to become the white market. The prices of all goods soared, all based on the price of rice as the standard, and woolen fabrics also jumped up completely because of this. However, it has recently stabilized. The wholesale prices of the main woolen fabrics per yard in the market are published as follows:

### Shanghai Shipping Industry Firmly Opposes Opening Yangtze River Inland Navigation Rights; Emergency Meeting to Be Held Within Days to Discuss

Since the newly appointed Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, expressed his support for opening up navigation rights on the Yangtze River to a Reuters reporter in Shanghai the other day, it has aroused firm opposition from the shipping industry in Shanghai. They stated that if the government purely intends to facilitate foreign ships in transporting relief supplies, allowing direct berthing at the three wharves of Nanjing, Jiujiang, and Hankou for unloading cargo, the shipping industry can accept this conditional opening. However, if the government disregards national sovereignty and unconditionally opens inland navigation rights across the board, the shipping industry is determined to oppose it and will protest with action if necessary. Currently, the shipping industry in Shanghai has decided to jointly submit a petition to the President and Sun Ke to oppose the opening of inland navigation rights and will convene an emergency meeting within the month to discuss countermeasures.

### Military, Police, and Gendarmerie Authorities Organize Patrols During Martial Law; Police Bureau to Conduct Temporary Surprise Inspections

Since the implementation of temporary martial law in Shanghai, the results have been good.

### Agricultural Reclamation Office Assists in Undertaking Drainage Projects for Two Lakes; Seventy Sets of Water Pumps Distributed to Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces

The Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Management Office of the Post-War Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Commission has been actively promoting mechanical agricultural reclamation work. Over the past year, the office has used various water pumps and tractors transported to China through the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to successively allocate them to agricultural groups across the country, providing farmers with significant assistance in cultivation. Recently, the office, considering that Poyang Lake in Jiangxi and Dongting Lake in Hunan are the largest lakes in the Yangtze River basin, and that the lakeside areas of both lakes are low-lying, deemed the use of water pumps essential to prevent flooding and abandonment of land. After discussions between the office and the governments of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, it was decided that the office would supply a large number of water pumps and other machinery to assist in the drainage projects in the lakeside areas of the two provinces. According to the contract signed between the office and the two provincial governments, for the Dongting Lake lakeside drainage project in Hunan Province, twelve-inch propeller-type water pumps, along with "Chrysler" brand 60-horsepower engines and necessary accessories, a total of forty sets, will be allocated. Initially, nine sets will be allocated, and then, depending on the capacity for utilization, allocations will continue until the end of March next year. The allocation to the Jiangxi Provincial Government for the Poyang Lake lakeside drainage project will be carried out in the same manner, but the number of water pumps is stipulated to be thirty sets, with six sets allocated initially. All expenses and machinery transportation costs will be borne by the two provincial governments, while the Agricultural Reclamation Office will only be responsible for technical guidance and assistance. According to the person in charge of the office, once the above machinery is delivered and used, the water conservancy projects in the lakeside areas of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces will be greatly improved in the future. This will not only guarantee the prevention of future floods and droughts, but will also be of great benefit to farmland.

### Anniversary of the Founding of the Agricultural Science Research Society

### Don't Wrong Impoverished Students with Scholarship Applications - An Enraging Incident Amidst News of School Fee Increases

[Report from our newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Government has approved an increase of one to three times in tuition fees for various private primary and secondary schools in Shanghai, due to the efforts of teachers and staff. Under the "legal" increase in fees, the income of teachers and staff can be slightly supplemented, but the burden on general parents will inevitably increase as a result. Although there is no perfect solution, it is still understandable to pay more tuition fees for the sake of the livelihood of teachers and staff. However, what makes many parents and concerned people in society indignant, uneasy, and unwilling to remain silent is the "school shop" style of some schools, where they are never tired of taking from students, but are extremely stingy when giving to poor students.

The other day, this newspaper's social services column responded to readers again regarding scholarships. It was said that there were originally 329 applicants to this newspaper for scholarships who had passed the initial review. However, after the re-examination by the Scholarship Unified Review Committee, only 137 people passed. The remaining 192 people were rejected because the schools they attended either never submitted a list of tuition-free students, or although they had submitted a list, the number of tuition-free spots was insufficient. According to the decision of the Scholarship Unified Review Committee, students applying for scholarships from any organizations or groups must be attending a school that already has a sufficient number of tuition-free students and cannot apply for more. This is intended to prevent schools from "being generous at the expense of others." Some schools (the names of which have been disclosed) either did not submit a list or, although they submitted a list, the number of spots was insufficient, so the applications could not be approved.

According to regulations, every middle school should have 20% of its students on tuition-free status. However, among the aforementioned schools, there are many with a long history and excellent reputation. Why have they failed to comply with the regulations? According to reporters who visited several people in charge, some said that most of the students in the school have fairly good family circumstances, and there are not many applicants for tuition exemption. Others claimed that although there are many applicants, there are very few who meet the requirements of being both impoverished and outstanding, and therefore there are not enough tuition-free spots. The reporter then asked why there were students from the school applying for scholarships from this newspaper, and why there were applicants considered qualified by this newspaper after review. They hesitated and said that they could re-investigate these students. According to insiders, some schools simply treat the 20% regulation as a dead letter, and make things extremely difficult and picky for students applying, the real reason being nothing more than their unwillingness to reduce income.

On the part of the Bureau of Education, all it can do for this type of school is to issue official documents urging them to comply. However, it is heard that many schools often ignore the orders of the Bureau of Education. The Scholarship Unified Review Committee will transfer the students who were affected by the insufficient number of tuition-free spots in their schools and were unable to receive scholarships from this newspaper to the Bureau of Education to order those schools to provide them with tuition exemptions. However, it is doubtful whether the schools will comply. Moreover, how long will it take between the transfer and the order? As for the scholarships from this newspaper, the amount for each middle school student is between ten and thirty yuan, which was worth about one stone of white rice at the beginning of this semester. However, because it had to be submitted to the Unified Review Committee for re-examination, and the Unified Review Committee had to wait for each school to submit its list of tuition-free students, the process was delayed until recently before it could be issued. However, the amount of ten or twenty yuan is now only enough for travel expenses for those who live far away to collect it. The purpose of the scholarship has been completely lost, and those in charge are deeply saddened by this.

### Expanding Relief to Accommodate Refugees; New Housing and Improved Management; Porridge Kitchens to Begin Operating Next Month

[Report from our newspaper] As the weather turns cold, the refugees on the streets huddle and shiver, in a very miserable state. Director Wu of the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday made a special statement saying: The Bureau is aware that the number of refugees fleeing to Shanghai is increasing day by day, and has decided to expand winter relief efforts. New housing will be built, and management methods will be improved. Refugees from disaster areas and unemployed vagrants will be housed separately, so that refugees with self-respect who are forced by actual needs will not be afraid of being accommodated. I have already ordered the vocational training center to prepare housing that can accommodate about 800 to 1,000 people. Unemployed vagrants and street beggars sent by the police station will be accommodated in the first and second shelters in Caohejing. The newly built accommodation facilities can temporarily accommodate 1,400 refugees, targeting disaster area refugees who are in dire need of assistance. The management policy is to improve living conditions, promote health, and encourage a spirit of mutual help and encouragement, so that they can obtain a reasonably warm life in difficult circumstances. Generally, refugees who requested to live with their families last year can also have this wish fulfilled this year. As for the labor relief work in Shenjijiang, Panlongjiang, Shajing Port, and Xiaobang in western Shanghai, more than 2,000 refugees are still working. Recently, there are also plans to dredge the Suzhou Creek, as the failure to dredge the river further will affect the navigation of rice boats next year. As for porridge kitchens, preparations are underway to set up 16 of them first, which can begin operating on the 10th of next month. The six in Zhabei can supply about 30,000 people, the three in Nanshi can supply about 7,000 people, and the two in Pudong can supply about 2,000 people. The others in Wusong, Jiangwan, as well as western Shanghai and Pudong, can supply a total of about 60,000 people. Relief for the destitute and the repatriation of refugees will continue.

### Upsets in Group A Football; Leading Team Performs Abnormally; Qingbai Unexpectedly Wins Big; Leading Team Loses Five Straight After Scoring First

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday's Group A football match between Qingbai and the leading team was unexpected. After scoring a goal in the first half, the leading team performed abnormally in the second half, losing five straight goals and ending the match 5-1. More than 10,000 fans attended the Yiyuan stadium yesterday, the largest turnout seen this season.

The first half yesterday was quite exciting. The leading team's Northeastern players performed well, and the Qingbai army was troubled and unable to make progress. Unexpectedly, the situation changed greatly in the second half, with the ball revolving around the leading team's territory. Qing Zhong successfully scored two goals, taking a 2-1 lead. Then, in the last 20 minutes, they scored three more goals, ending the match 5-1. The Qingbai forwards had some excellent performances. The leading team repeatedly failed to score in the second half, their attacks were completely blocked, and with the carelessness of the defense, they were unable to save the game. The intensity of the competition could not be represented by the score of 5-1.

Match Overview

Referee Zhang Le, linesmen Wu Shouheng and Chen Jixiang. Qingbai attacked first, and the leading team counterattacked, controlling the midfield and kicking fiercely. After a stalemate of 15 minutes, Gu Yourong was fouled by Qingbai, and a penalty kick was awarded. Jiang Xian's skillful shot failed to score, which was actually an unfavorable sign for the leading team. Five minutes later, Gu Dirong stole the ball, and Meng Yiliang slipped and fell on the spot. Huang Shijie rushed out, and Gu Yourong calmly scored, giving the leading team the first goal. The first half ended 1-0.

After a break, both teams returned to the field with the same lineups. Qingbai counterattacked and launched a great offensive. Within five minutes, A Fu passed to Jin Lu in the chaos, each scoring a goal and tying the score. The ball was still in Qingbai's hands. After ten minutes, Xiao Luo advanced and passed to A Fu near the goal. Seeing the critical situation, Lv Chengshi rushed out, and A Fu chipped the ball into the net. Qingbai took a 2-1 lead. The leading team counterattacked, but was blocked everywhere, and their morale gradually declined. However, the situation was still very even, and there was a possibility of a comeback. Unexpectedly, at 30 minutes, Fei Chunhua passed the ball to A Fu. Zheng Bingyi tried to block him, but A Fu dribbled past him and angled the ball into the net near the goal, making it 3-1. Qingbai came back strong, and Xue Peiran passed to Xiao Luo, who cut through three defenders and swept the ball into the net, making it 4-1. The leading team's situation was dire. Before the end of the match, Xiao Luo scored another low shot, and Yan Chengkuan was unable to save it, ending the match 5-1.

### First Round of the Xuzhou Campaign (Part 1)

— Special Correspondent Ling Songshou

[Taibo Bengbu 25th Rapid Dispatch] The initial victory of the Xuzhou Campaign will be declared to the world: Victory will forever belong to righteousness. Before the campaign broke out, the National Army had already voluntarily abandoned Ye Zheng, Bian, Shangqiu, and Donghai, Lianyungang, and other places, concentrating its forces on the periphery of Xuzhou. At that time, facing Xuzhou directly was the Li Mi Army Corps, to the west of Xuzhou was the Qiu Qingquan Army Corps, and to the east of Xuzhou was the Huang Baitao Army Corps. These three major army corps, in the past two years of suppressing the rebellion, fought in Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and other places, and were all iron troops that were victorious in every battle. In addition, the Battle of Xuzhou was not only to defend Xuzhou, nor only to defend the capital, but to defend the independence, democracy, and freedom of our Chinese nation. The stakes were high, so the National Army in this war was "an army of grief." Every soldier understood how sacred and important a mission they were carrying on their shoulders today, and they were all willing to fight to the death against the communist bandits for the sake of the country and the nation, just as General Liu Jingfu, commander-in-chief of the Xuzhou Anti-Bandit Headquarters, said: "We have the belief that we will win, and the determination to die." Therefore, in essence, the National Army already possessed the foundation for victory.

How the Communist Bandits Invaded

The deployment of the communist bandits was as follows: Liu Bocheng's First, Third, Ninth, and Eleventh Columns, Chen Geng's Fourth and Ninth Columns, and Chen Yi's Third, Eighth, and Liangguang Columns, for a total of four, two, and three columns respectively, launched a containment attack on the Qiu Qingquan Army Corps on the west side of Xuzhou; Chen Yi's First, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, New Eighth, and Tenth Columns, for a total of six columns, attacked the front of Xuzhou to contain the Li Mi Army Corps; and Chen Yi's Second, New Seventh, New Ninth, Ninth, Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Columns, for a total of seven columns, launched a main force attack on the Huang Baitao Army Corps on the east side of Xuzhou.

The battle officially began on November 8. On the morning of that day, the communist bandits attacked Hanzhuang with the Seventh and New Eighth Columns. The National Army, for strategic reasons, annihilated a part of the main force of the invading communist bandits and then withdrew from the defense. That night, the communist bandits on the east and west sides of Xuzhou began to attack the two flanks of the National Army again.

Good News from the East and West Wings

On the western flank, the communist bandits used Chen Geng's Fourth and Ninth Columns, and a part of Chen Yi's Third, Eighth, and Liangguang Columns, encountering the "Fire Bull Army" Qiu Qingquan Army Corps, which dominated eastern Henan. How could they let go? In the Battle of Huangkou, the bandits suffered more than 10,000 casualties, and the National Army first reported good news.

On the eastern flank, the Huang Army Corps used the Grand Canal as a barrier and met the incoming Chen bandit Second, New Seventh, Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Columns head-on, inflicting heavy damage on the bandits in the Yunhezhan and Yaowan areas.

Huang Army Corps Fights Hard Battles

The original position of the Huang Army Corps was the area on both sides of the Longhai Railway from Daxujia, east of Xuzhou, to Yunhezhan. Starting on the 9th, the bandit First, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, New Eighth, and Tenth Columns, which were originally on the Hanzhuang, Taierzhuang line, rushed south, first cutting off the connection between the Huang Army Corps and Xuzhou. At this time, the bandit Second, Eleventh, and Twelfth Columns on the eastern front circled to the south of Nianzhuang, the main position of the Huang Army Corps, and a siege situation was formed on the 10th. The Huang Army Corps then shortened its position, with Nianzhuang as the core, and launched a fierce battle against the communist bandits, who outnumbered them several times.

General Huang Baitao has been fighting in the battlefields of southern Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and eastern Henan for many years and is known for his stability and toughness. He naturally would not miss this best opportunity to annihilate the main force of the bandit army. Thus, good news was reported again on the 12th. The Huang Army Corps, in coordination with the air force, defeated the offensive of more than 160,000 bandits from nine columns on the eastern front, and the bandit army suffered more than 37,000 casualties.

Qiu Army Corps Counter-Surrounds

The communist bandits' intention to "eat up" the Huang Army Corps was already obvious. Therefore, the authorities again ordered the Qiu Qingquan Army Corps, which was originally on the western wing, to advance eastward and deploy a counter-encirclement posture against the bandits on the eastern front. At this time, the remnants of the Liu and Chen departments, which had been hit hard on the western front, still attempted to attack the eastern front and prevent the eastward advance of the Qiu Army Corps. Thus, on the 13th, they were divided into three routes, detouring and fleeing south between the Xiaoxian and Yongcheng areas, spying on the southern side of Xuzhou and the Su County. The Xuzhou side had anticipated this move by the communist bandits and immediately transferred the Sun Yuanliang Army Corps, which was sweeping the Wo Meng area, north to defend Xuzhou. Although the Su County county seat fell on the night of the 15th under the desperate defense of the garrison police and the general team, it had no impact on the Xuzhou battle situation at that time.

Liu Bandit's southward advance could not stop the actions of the Qiu Army Corps. The Qiu Army Corps advanced along the south side of the Longhai Road on the 13th. Our armored vehicle groups, under the command of Colonel Jiang Weiguo, also cooperated with the Qiu Army Corps to attack the Chen bandit First, Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth Columns, which were stubbornly resisting on the south side. At 10:00 AM on the 16th, the Qiu Army Corps, in coordination with the air force and tanks, annihilated more than 20,000 communist bandits along the way and joined forces with the Huang Army Corps, which had been besieged for six days and nights. During the period when the Qiu Army Corps advanced eastward, the Huang Army Corps continued to eliminate more than 10,000 of the bandit's main force. The good news from the Xuzhou Anti-Bandit Headquarters spread throughout the country that day, and those who were concerned about the battle situation smiled for this victory.

Three Major Army Corps Join Forces

Qiu and Huang joined forces, and the two major army corps, in cooperation with Li Mi's forces, pursued and suppressed the bandits separately. The communist bandits seemed to feel that this disastrous defeat was not enough. Starting on the 17th, they urgently regrouped their remnants and launched a fierce attack on the eastern front, and Chen Yi's Second, Fourth, and Twelfth Columns, in cooperation with Liu Bocheng's forces, which were originally on the southern side of Xuzhou, attempted to attack the southeastern side of Xuzhou. In the days before this time, the Sun Yuanliang Army Corps on the southern side of Xuzhou had already annihilated more than 5,000 of the Liu and Chen departments who had come to their deaths.

Since the communist army was unwilling to admit defeat and returned to the battlefield to fight like trapped beasts, it was exactly what the National Army wanted. Therefore, the Qiu Army Corps returned to encircle and suppress them. From the evening of the 17th to dawn on the 18th, in one night, the sparks of our National Army's guns and cannons and the roar of the divine eagles annihilated more than 20,000 communist bandits in the main battlefield of Pantang Town, more than 20 li southeast of Xuzhou. More than 8,000 kind compatriots, who had already realized the truth and had been driven by the communist bandits to fight, surrendered to the National Army one after another. This was the "Victory of Southern Xuzhou." The Qiu Army Corps, in conjunction with the Sun Army Corps, took advantage of the victory to suppress the south, arriving south of Sanbao on the 19th and continuing to reap fruitful results.

Repeatedly Defending Nianzhuang

The day the Qiu Army Corps returned was the time when the Huang Army Corps on the eastern front was fighting hard to continue attracting the main force of the bandits and defending Nianzhuang alone. The Li Mi Army Corps, which advanced eastward from Xuzhou, was met with stubborn resistance from the communist bandits along the way. Although the gains were abundant, the speed of advance was inevitably discounted. Until the 22nd, the Li Army Corps was still more than 30 li away from Nianzhuang. On the 21st, the Huang Army Corps, which had been defending Nianzhuang for twelve days and nights, was subjected to intensive fire from the communist bandits. In terms of shells alone, the Nianzhuang position received more than 10,000 rounds. The stronghold fortifications had been completely destroyed and were unusable. The Huang Army Corps transferred to a certain block of positions northeast of Nianzhuang and continued to fight hard.

Gains Exceed Losses

The Xuzhou Campaign is different from previous major battles. This campaign is a decisive battle in which both the bandits and our side use their main forces south of the Yellow River. Therefore, in this campaign, the gain or loss of a village or town is not of great importance to the overall situation. Taking the Huang Army Corps as an example, under the siege of forces several times greater than ours, it defended a lonely point for more than ten days and nights, and killed more than 100,000 bandits. This is a brilliant record that is only seen in the process of suppressing bandits. As long as the Huang Army Corps is on the eastern front for one day, it will attract the main force of the communist bandits, allowing the Li, Qiu, and Sun Army Corps near Xuzhou to calmly solve the main force of the bandits. As long as the Huang Army Corps is on the eastern front for one day, the communist bandits will not be able to escape outside the main battlefield, but will sit and wait for our various armies to deploy encirclements and annihilate them in one fell swoop. Therefore, even if Huang Fengyou suffered considerable losses on the night of the 13th, these losses are insignificant compared to the results currently achieved by the National Army. The main thing is that these minor losses will lay the foundation for the National Army to achieve greater victories in the next stage of the Xuzhou Campaign.

Communist Bandits Suffer 200,000 Casualties

Speaking of the entire development process of the battle situation, we can regard the "Great Victory of Southern Xuzhou" as the end of the initial battles of the Xuzhou Campaign. In this stage, there is no doubt that victory belongs to the National Army. In the communist bandits' broadcast on the 14th, they themselves admitted to more than 60,000 casualties. In the broadcast on the 16th, they themselves admitted to 100,000 casualties. Adding the communist bandits' casualties in the two subsequent battles of eastern and southern Xuzhou, and the difference between what they may have discounted in their own broadcasts, we estimate that the communist bandits suffered 200,000 casualties, which is by no means an exaggeration. Even if the strength of the communist bandits south of the Yellow River is greater, it will never exceed 600,000. Now, one-third of it has been lost. Judging from the results of the initial stage of the campaign, we dare to assert that the communist bandits in central China will not be able to achieve anything more in the future, especially since the environment in the second stage of the campaign is more favorable to the National Army.

### A Scandalous Tragedy: Military Officer Draws Gun and Kills Wife

[This Newspaper Zhenjiang 26th Dispatch] At 8 PM on the 24th, a scandalous tragedy occurred here. A military officer from a certain unit lived with his concubine at No. 155 Zhongzheng Road. The concubine was usually restless. On the evening of the 24th, the military officer returned and heard a man's voice in the room. He lifted the curtain and entered. At that time, there was a power outage, and in the darkness, he saw a man and his concubine sitting side by side on the bed, talking intimately. When the concubine saw the military officer enter the room, she got up and hugged the military officer, allowing the man to jump out of the window and escape. The military officer was furious and fired a shot, killing the concubine immediately. After the tragedy occurred, the military officer went to the Second Branch Bureau to surrender himself. On the 25th, he was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation.

### Miniature News

Wujin

[This Newspaper Dispatch] The Jiang Defense Headquarters telegraphed the county, stating that treacherous bandits north of the river were using civilian boats and rafts, disguised, to cross the Yangtze River into southern Jiangsu. From now on, boats sailing south from the north, without certification documents from the county government and the boat industry association, will be strictly prohibited from entering.

Fengxian

[This Newspaper Dispatch] This county is not a rice-producing area, and the people's food relies on Songjiang, Jinshan, and neighboring counties. However, since the price limit was lifted, general peddlers and Shanghai residents have been rushing to buy, causing the reserves to be depleted day by day and stimulating grain prices. In order to prevent a food shortage, the county government has specially formulated measures to restrict the export of rice, which will be implemented immediately.

Hefei

[This Newspaper Dispatch] The Anhui Provincial Government, in order to improve the administrative efficiency of 64 counties and cities and strengthen the implementation of overall war plans, has decided at a regular meeting to transfer 500 staff members from various departments to various counties and cities to assist in promoting administrative work. The provincial government will also prepay three months' salary to enhance their morale.

### Expanding Gold and Silver Yuan Exchange: Hangzhou and Other Places to Implement at the Beginning of the Month: Gold and Silver Have Been Airlifted to Various Places for Reserve: Unlimited Long-Term Exchange

Since the Central Bank and designated banks in the seven major cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Peiping, and Tianjin began handling deposit exchanges for gold and silver coins on the 22nd of this month, those applying for deposit exchanges have been extremely crowded, and long queues have reappeared in front of the banks handling the exchanges.

The Central Mint has been ordered to step up the casting of various gold bars in recent days. The daily melting volume has now been expanded to 10,000 bars. After the completion, the factory has been continuously transporting them to the Central Bank and airlifting them to various places for reserve.

In addition to the above seven major cities, the authorities have decided to expand the exchange area. The central banks in 19 cities including Hangzhou, Anqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming, Guilin, Changsha, Fuzhou, Shantou, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Qingdao, Nanchang, Dihua, Yaan, Ningxia, Wuhu, etc., will also begin handling deposit exchanges the day after tomorrow (December 1). The Central Bank has airlifted huge amounts of gold bars to the above-mentioned places separately. All will implement the exchange on schedule from that day.

According to financial officials: The government controls a huge amount of gold and silver. In addition to the huge amount of gold and silver recovered last time, the gold part also has a large number of gold bricks purchased from the United States for long-term exchange and application. The silver yuan part, the amount of silver and silver coins previously stored, is also huge. Therefore, various places will handle exchanges on a long-term and unlimited basis to strengthen the recovery of gold yuan coupons and tighten the currency.

### Strengthening Treasury Bill Sales: Properly Formulating Improvement Measures

The authorities will announce it in the short term

The short-term treasury bills issued by the Central Bank have recently had poor sales results due to the high black market interest rates, which are quite different from the interest rates on the treasury bills. According to related sources, the authorities are now properly formulating improvement measures to strengthen the sales force of the treasury bills. Concrete measures can be announced in the short term.

### General Purchasing Power is Weak: Cigarette Market is Depressed

In the past week, the market price of cigarettes has been sluggish and has shown a downward trend. The rapid decline in its trend is beyond the expectations of the general industry.

According to observations by people in the industry, there are two main reasons: (1) Due to the wait-and-see attitude of large households and massive dumping. (2) After the last sharp increase in cigarette prices, general purchasing power has been greatly reduced. The sales volume in this city is limited, and various cigarette factories have resumed dispatching goods one after another, resulting in a more abundant inventory on the market. In addition, factors such as the tight money supply in the market, the lack of cash, and the unusually high black market interest rates have caused the cigarette market to be depressed. Without special circumstances, it is difficult to expect a turnaround in the short term.

### Taiwan Coal is Continuously Shipped to Shanghai to Solve Winter Consumption

As winter approaches, the amount of coal consumed in this city has increased sharply. The amount of coal used by various power companies in this city has also increased sharply due to the increasing consumption of electric heating recently. However, the amount of coal shipped south from the north has been decreasing day by day due to the impact of the war. The winter coal use in this city is quite worrying.

The National Coal Mine Merchants Joint Operation Office of this city yesterday added seven more ships to transport coal from a certain port in Taiwan to Shanghai. Among them, the "Luanzhou" and "Fufu" ships have loaded more than 13,000 tons of coal and have set sail from Keelung Port, which will be transported to Shanghai within about a week.

### Reporter Consultation: Legal Interpretation: Different Prices for Rice Rent Reduction: Dangerous Buildings Endanger Lives

[Mr. Xue Zhenwen asks] (1) I rented a front building last year, and the monthly rent is three dou of medium-grade rice. I pay the monthly rent in advance on the first day of each month, according to the market price published in the daily newspaper. However, the landlord suddenly claims that I must supplement it according to the market price in the evening newspaper. The two sides insist on their own opinions. I don't know how to solve it. (2) There is a loft in my residence, which was built a year ago. Because of shoddy workmanship and material reduction at that time, the beams shake when I move, which is extremely dangerous. I have repeatedly notified them to add materials, but they ignore it. In case of misfortune, my life is in danger. How should I deal with it?

[Lawyer Chuan Kuangling answers] (1) Since the two parties have agreed to pay the monthly rent based on the rice value, they should follow their agreement. However, the rice value for converting rent varies. You can calculate and pay according to the government-stipulated rationed rice price. If it is still not harmonious, you can sue the court for a fair ruling. (2) You can refer to the provisions of Article 429 and Article 430 of the Civil Code.

### Interpretation of "Official"

— Lei Ting

In our country, officials have always been high above. And among the four classes of people, the closest to officials are scholars. "He who excels in learning can become an official" is the most obvious annotation. The Rites of Zhou says: "Establish officials and divide duties," then the establishment of officials should be to guard their respective duties and govern the country. Also: "Discuss and decide, then appoint them as officials." The so-called "discussion" is of course the court's evaluation and general public opinion; this on the one hand shows that the appointment of officials must be cautious, and on the other hand also shows that officials should have their reputation and ambitions. After the Republic of China, the name of officials has changed to public servants, without the dignity of "sir" and "master" in the autocratic era, and is civilianized. But because they still manage the affairs of the public and have power, the name has changed but the reality remains, and they are still high above.

Accordingly, the so-called officials, whether in the autocratic era or the democratic era, are dignified, at least in China, in today's China, it is still so. The so-called public servant is only convenient for making a comparison with democracy. If someone considers themselves the master and treats officials as "servants," then it is far from the truth.

Therefore, my first view of officials is:

This is the first interpretation.

But the principle of "he who excels in learning can become an official" has not changed. What is different is that in the autocratic era, imperial examination graduates were the stepping stone to becoming officials, but now they have been replaced by doctors or masters. In the past, it was an honor to be a student of the emperor, but now it is fashionable to be a gilded doctor; the names are different, but the reality is somewhat similar (like an American tailor who becomes president, there is no precedent in our country). As for the recently added social elites, they are slightly equivalent to the former recluse scholars, which is only a rare opportunity. So the most important thing is still learning. But the so-called learning is not necessarily the "learning" of classics and arguments, the talent to govern the world cannot be seen in books alone.

So my second view of officials is:

Academic qualifications plus reputation. If they can also add elegance, it would be even better.

This is the second interpretation.

The above is the essence of officials, or to put it bluntly, the capital of officials. The greater the capital, the higher the position one can climb, which is an immutable truth.

But relying on capital alone is still not enough. Because this is just a stepping stone. Once the door is opened, the stone is useless. For example, people who went from scholar to official in the past did become officials, but some ended up ruined and discredited, some remained honest and poor, and some never climbed up. So the reason for this is the lack of skill. Therefore, the most important method for being an official is skill.

Speaking of skill, it is truly ever-changing, mysterious and infinite. But to put it concisely, it is nothing more than eight words: "Adapt to the times, respond to circumstances." For example, one should be serious when it is appropriate to be serious, and one should be gentle when it is appropriate to be gentle; the first sentence is based on the law, and the second sentence may as well be based on human feelings. "Deep sympathy" is a generous gesture that costs nothing, the more the better; "Should be without discussion" is a righteous and stern idiom, why not use it—the more methods the better, it is permissible to use words instead of actions, because the Chinese people are the most forgetful nation; one must have the courage to deny what one said today, and one must have the ability to overturn the order issued in the morning in the afternoon. In short, if the target is a sheep, one should appear as a tiger; if the target is a tiger, one may as well temporarily stoop to be a sheep. Using the immutable to respond to the ever-changing is our political policy, and changing faces billions of times is the method of being an official for our public servants today. Therefore, my third view of officials is:

Ever-changing, one should have the abilities of the Great Sage Equal to Heaven.

This is the third interpretation.

Writing here, I suddenly thought of the two sentences in the first paragraph, "govern the country" and "discuss and decide, then appoint them as officials." How should they be explained?

This thought made me dazed. However, I may as well say this: "Discussion" is the judgment of the superior, and "decision" is the decision of the superior. Once the judgment and decision of the superior are made, the judged and decided wear the uniform of a public servant and take office.

Then what about "govern the country"? This is really impossible to answer. Fortunately, a flash of inspiration came, and I brazenly replied: "Originally, I had already forgotten it, so I might as well forget it completely, fortunately, most of our public servants, most of them seem to have forgotten it long ago."

### Yongqi's Sayings

— Wu Yong

To seek the governance of the country, it is most important to cultivate a good social atmosphere. "Those above have what they like, those below will inevitably have more," this means that the atmosphere must be cultivated from top to bottom. This is one saying. In a democratic country, however, if the people have what they like, those above must inevitably do so, which is from bottom to top. From bottom to top is also a good atmosphere in itself.

People only advocate the theory of mutual assistance when they need help from others.

Telling people not to steal oil is set up by those who fear that their oil will be stolen.

"Obedience" is a word from superiors to subordinates, which is also one-sided

Whether it is people or things, being too good will become not good; conversely, as long as it is kept within limits, the bad will not become truly bad. As long as you adhere to the doctrine of the mean, even "doing everything" is not impossible

There are hateful hypocrites and lovable true villains in the world.

### Selling Books

— You Mojun

When I count on my fingers, it's been more than forty years since I started making a living inhaling chalk dust. For half my life, I haven't liked anything else, only books. I'd rather wear shabby clothes and eat poorly, but I can't help but buy books. Because of this, in my humble abode, the simple room, on the table, on the shelves, even in the kerosene boxes and broken leather trunks, are all filled with books. Only I know where a certain book is, which book is under which book. My family never dares to move them recklessly; therefore, although this simple room doesn't have a fierce tiger sign hanging high that reads "No Entry for Outsiders," it seems to have become my forbidden territory.

In recent years, I don't know why, but I always feel that being a poor teacher doesn't amount to much, so I vowed never to buy books again. In the past, I liked to run to new and used bookstores, take out my wallet and exchange it for one or two books, carry them home, and treasure them like precious jewels. Now, I simply don't dare to even glance at the new book advertisements published in the daily newspapers by major bookstores, because every time I touch my wallet, "it's empty, I have exhausted both ends by tapping on it!" There is no shortage of books I love to read in the school library, but these books can only be treated as honored guests, and I don't dare keep them for many days.

My old wife has repeatedly advised me that since our descendants are not scholars, what use are these books? Why not sort them out yourself: keep what can be kept, and sell what cannot be kept, or even sell them by the pound. What she says is not without merit. But I'm so busy running around for food and clothing, where do I have the time to sort them out? Even if I had the time, tell me, like a book of poetic rhymes, I bought it when I was thirteen or fourteen years old when I was learning to write five-character eight-line examination papers. Now I don't need it to guide me, but out of old affection, how can I bear to part with it and sell it by the pound, so that it can be used as recycled paper, or even appear on a pancake stall!

Recently, my younger brother Zhi Ren also had the idea of selling books. His reason is that there's no use keeping them, and selling them now can still be used for other purposes. He advised me that since I'm not studying national history, a set of the Twenty-Five Histories published by Kaiming Press can really be exchanged for some fish and meat to eat. What he says is absolutely right. However, this time when I returned home, I saw that the set of Twenty-Five Histories was still holding its ground, maintaining its consistent motionless posture, standing in that broken bookcase, fulfilling its duty of guarding. I could only glance at it, sigh, and leave!

My humble abode originally had many years' worth of this newspaper, bound into volumes. Probably because my family saw that I was useless, they took advantage of my being in Shanghai and sold them by the pound in a rough manner to exchange for rice. I thought to myself: unless they are willing to take drastic measures, I am determined not to think about buying books again.

### Eastern Scales and Western Claws

Recently, Johns Hopkins University in the United States suddenly announced that it would buy fireflies in large quantities. Regardless of whether they are dead or alive, the price for every hundred fireflies is 25 cents (US), which suddenly made all the children in the city very busy. According to the university, the light at the tail of the firefly may contain vitamin K.

Although the Second World War ended three years ago, the naval mines drifting in the ocean have not yet been completely cleared. Since the armistice, 250 ships from various countries around the world have been endangered by them, of which 116 have been sunk or severely damaged beyond repair.

### "My Family"

— Xi Hou

In the past, people often boasted about the outstanding figures in their family with a tone of admiration, such as: "This is my family's thousand-mile colt!" "My family's yellow-bearded boy!" They sounded very intimate and touching. Later generations, whether because they couldn't squeeze out any talent or because they particularly respected their ancestors, always traced back ten or dozens of generations, picking out a suitable figure or two. For example, those surnamed Tao would talk about "My family's Yuanming," and those surnamed Li would mention "My family's Taibai," with a smug look on their faces, as if they possessed the legacy of Yuanming and Taibai.

Sometimes this scope is further expanded to "My family's Taizhen" and "My family's Xiaoxiao," which feels even more romantic and unrestrained. However, women themselves rarely mention "My family's Daoyun" or "My family's Yi'an." This is naturally due to the male-centered society, where women themselves take their husband's surname and cannot speak out. This clever trick can only be occupied by men.

Even now, the clamor of "My family this and that" is still endless. The speaker may be unintentional, but the listener finds it disgusting. It doesn't stop there. Even a lake or a mountain, if it is related to the surname of a predecessor, descendants will come forward to claim it. Not long ago, I even saw a descendant of a "poor village chief" (?), who, when mentioning Tianping Mountain in Suzhou, actually said it was "My family's Tianping." This is because Tianping is also known as "Fan Grave Mountain." As times progress, there will eventually be a day when someone boasts: "Look at the world today, it is all my family's domain!"

### Never Let Go Even in Death

— Nan Wu

There are many stubborn people who become more and more prejudiced as they get older, so that they even tightly control their descendants in their wills, requiring those heirs to fulfill certain conditions before they can receive the inheritance. Their conditions are sometimes simply absurd and ridiculous, almost like a joke, but at least in the United States, these conditions have legal value.

One old maid hated more than anything the way young girls dressed up in fancy clothes. Therefore, in her will, she said that she was willing to pass all her property to her great-niece, but on one condition: that the great-niece not use any makeup within six months of her death. The young girl followed the will and successfully inherited the estate.

Isabella, the daughter of Isaac Merritt Singer, the inventor of the Singer sewing machine, was a nun. Her father's will stipulated that his inheritance of $1.3 million be passed on to her, but only on the condition that she first "return to secular life." But Isabella remained a nun as before.

One person's will stipulated that the large-scale insurance company he ran be inherited by his younger brother, but there was also a strange condition – the female employees employed in the store must all weigh more than 140 pounds. His younger brother happily complied.

The strangest thing is that one person promised on his deathbed to give all his money to his wife, but on one condition: that she must remarry within five years of his death. His will explained that he wanted to let others know how difficult it was to get along with her.

### Leather Helmet Collection

Now gold is allowed to be held. Before the ban was lifted, the North also vigorously promoted the inspection of private hoards and rewarded informers several times. The inspection was initiated by the government. Just send more police officers to "raid" gold and silver shops. As for the hoarding of ordinary people, in densely populated cities, it is really impossible to investigate. It can only rely on private informants. The article rewarding informers stated: If a private hoard is found, a certain amount can be given to the informer. The article restricting informants stated: The real name and address must be provided to prevent malicious accusations. It was thought that this was a thorough method. Whether it is thorough or not, let's not discuss it for now, but a comedy (or tragedy) of informing that occurred in Tianjin is worth discussing.

After a long delay, a case of informing about gold hoarding finally occurred. Indeed, 23 taels of gold were found. Indeed, the informer's real name and address were clear, without any ambiguity. It turned out to be a woman, and the accused was her husband. And the reason for informing was that the husband had an affair and used the gold to subsidize his lover, which aroused her anger, and she decided to fight to the end! Since the motive was like this, of course there was no need to remain anonymous, and the family dispute was presented frankly and completely, as if a scene from "Two Beauties Fighting for a Husband" (also known as "Double Rocking Society") was being staged, or as if Chong Gongdao in the play "The Female Escort" said about Su San and Pi Shi: "The vinegar sea is stirring up waves!" This is indeed a "tragic comedy," but such a theatrical scene actually occurred in the midst of the vigorously promoted "economic reform"! We have no time to be sad or happy about this family's scandal.

It must be known that the act of "informing" has a great relationship with people's hearts, customs, and social order. In the past, the government was extremely cautious about this and prevented abuses, never using it lightly, fearing that accomplices would use it for private gain and hinder the political system. As for the people, if it is not their business, they are not willing to get involved. Even if they get a reward, it is like "grabbing mutton and getting a bad smell all over your body." The criticism of the public and the anxiety of future troubles outweigh the gains. This is easy to understand. Therefore, if there is really an act of informing, it must be private anger, and not ordinary anger, but anger that "burns in the fire and fights to the end!" In this case, of course, one is not afraid to come forward with one's name. What is embarrassing is the government's side. If it is not dealt with, its own decrees cannot be justified. If it is dealt with, it is obviously helping someone eliminate jealousy, which does not seem like official business.

In the past imperial era, informing was only allowed for treason. Many literary inquisitions in the early Qing Dynasty arose from this. This was the emperor's selfishness, coupled with racial prejudice, fearing that someone would miss the previous Ming Dynasty and plot rebellion. As for ordinary political affairs, government offices could report cases of harboring thieves and smuggling, but there was no so-called "informing." (For secret societies that attempt to rebel, there is the term "informing," which is still a rebellious case in nature.) In the private sector, only scoundrels who harbor private anger or hope to gain honor by betraying friends are willing to come forward. Even if they receive a reward, they will be regarded as "terrifying objects" in society and villages and will be rejected by the public. In short, the term "informing" is definitely not a common practice on the political track, (1) harming the political system, (2) damaging customs, and (3) losing people's hearts.

Therefore, the Tianjin case is not worth laughing at if it is just a family matter. But as a natural satire of the government's reward for informing, it is very interesting.

### Letter to Xia Quchan

— Yao Yuanzhu

The scenery of rivers and mountains and wine parties have all ended; for forty years, all I can do is laugh. I only worry about the changes in the world since the fall of the Jin Dynasty; how can I discuss talent in a desperate situation? The tip of the spear points to the rice morning after morning, suppressing the town. Deep down, I know the zither is everywhere. Thank you, my two or three friends of Longquan, relying on your teeth and cheeks, you burst forth with wind and thunder.

The bearded Shi talks about rare treasures with a stuttering mouth. Clouds under the sun are asked about, and both are unparalleled. It is difficult to accept your hand in my dreams of the two lakes; I am intoxicated with the wine of Yue, which can be compared to a person. I have abandoned learning all my life, not without friends; in this world, I have not allowed anyone like you to be my neighbor! I further ask about the surviving manuscripts at Maoling, at once raising my head to gaze toward the west of Qin. (The letter inquired about Wang Liuyi's surviving manuscripts)
