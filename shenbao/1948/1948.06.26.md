[Our Correspondent in Xi'an, 25th] Generals have gathered in Xi'an and are holding a meeting at a certain location to make new decisions regarding cooperation on future bandit suppression strategies in the Northwest and military education. Chairman Zhu Shaoyu of Shaanxi Province returned to Xi'an from Shanghai this afternoon after being summoned for official business.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 25th] The President received Zhang Zhizhong, Ma Hongbin, Ma Bufang, and more than ten division and brigade commanders at his residence here today. In addition to inquiring about the military and political situation in various regions, he also commended the generals for their performance in the battle to annihilate bandits in the Jing and Wei River valleys. It is reported that the President will return to Nanjing within days.

[Our Correspondent in Lanzhou, 25th] Ma Jiyuan, commander of the 12th Division, arrived in Xi'an this afternoon on a special plane from Xining after being summoned by the President. He will pay his respects to the President and attend the military conference.

[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 25th] The National Army along the Longhai Railway is rapidly advancing in a pincer attack towards Biancheng (Kaifeng). The National Army under Qiu Qingquan, moving from the west, captured Lanfeng yesterday and has now pressed on to Ba Wang, annihilating one battalion of the 2nd Division of the First Bandit Column. The National Army under Sun Yuanliang, moving from the east, captured Zhongmu yesterday and continues to advance towards Biancheng. Furthermore, the majority of the bandits fleeing from southwestern Shandong still occupy the area around Sui County and Qi County.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 25th] According to an urgent telegram from the Yudong (Eastern Henan) front line of the Military News Agency at 9:30 PM on the 25th: Today, the National Army's eastward advancing force and westward advancing force, together with the Kaifeng garrison that shifted its position to the outskirts on the 22nd, launched a fierce encirclement and suppression campaign against the 10th Column of the Chen (bandits) force, which was covering the retreat. Local defense teams in the Gu area behind the bandits also rose up to attack the bandits' rear. The bandits were unable to withstand the attacks and fled southward. The vanguard of the National Army's rapid units entered Kaifeng City at 9:00 PM on the 25th and is currently searching and suppressing the remaining bandits in the surrounding areas. The telegram also stated: The various National Army forces had cleared the remaining bandits in the areas surrounding Lanfeng by the 24th and recaptured Lanfeng City. The National Army, which annihilated the 3rd Battalion of the 6th Regiment of the 2nd Division of the Chen (bandits) First Column at Longtanggang on the afternoon of the 24th, had advanced to the vicinity of Longhuzhai, northeast of Qi County, in the evening and is currently attacking Qi County. The powerful forces advancing westward from Mahuozhuang (12 kilometers southwest of Lanfeng) and Miaojunying (approximately 15 kilometers southwest of Lanfeng) advanced directly towards Kaifeng after defeating the bandits' weak resistance. The National Army, advancing southward from Heze, defeated the 10th Division of the Chen (bandits) Sixth Column east of Kaocheng and recaptured Sanyizhai (7 kilometers northwest of Lanfeng) on the evening of the 24th. The remaining bandits fled southward, and the National Army is still in pursuit. A certain unit of the National Army west of Kaifeng recaptured Zhongmu on the 24th and is now taking advantage of the victory to rapidly advance towards Biancheng.

### He Yingqin States in the Legislative Yuan That the Fall of Kaifeng Was Unexpected and Its Impact on the Central Plains War Situation Is Still Minor

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Minister of National Defense He Yingqin made a statement on the recent Central Plains war situation at a temporary secret meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 24th. His report has been organized and published by the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan (the main points of the report were published in yesterday's newspaper).

According to He, regarding the Central Plains war situation, the Supreme Commander and all staff members of the General Staff have devoted themselves to the planning of operations and the guidance of troop movements from the beginning to the present, hoping to capture and annihilate the main forces of the Chen and Liu bandits in this battle to stabilize the military situation for bandit suppression in Central China. The Battle of Kaifeng is actually a part of this overall campaign. If the city had not fallen, the results would naturally have been achieved more quickly. Unfortunately, its fall has had some impact on the progress of the campaign, but it is not a major obstacle. In the past, Baoji in Shaanxi Province fell, but the main force of the Peng (bandits) was eliminated by us in eastern Gansu, and Baoji and other counties were quickly recovered. This is one example. Kaifeng is the capital of Henan Province, with many civil servants and residents, and should be defended with particular determination. The General Staff had allocated three National Army regiments and six security force regiments to Kaifeng, and temporarily added another National Army regiment, totaling ten regiments. It was originally hoped that they could hold out for at least ten days. It was anticipated that our reinforcements would break through the bandit forces along the way and reach the outskirts of Kaifeng in less than ten days, forming an inner and outer pincer attack. Unexpectedly, the bandits began attacking the city on the 17th and broke through the city gates on the 18th, resulting in street fighting. This fact was unexpected. After receiving this news, Chief of General Staff Gu flew to Zhengzhou, and the Supreme Commander also flew to inspect the situation, hoping to get reinforcements there as soon as possible. However, because the Kaifeng City had been breached too quickly, the reinforcements could not reach it in time. By the 22nd, communication within the city was cut off, and the situation was unclear.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 25th] He Yingqin telegraphed here today, stating that due to unfinished business in Nanjing, his trip north would be postponed.

### Weng Wenhao Responds to Henan Petition Delegation, Decides to Increase Disaster Relief Funds for Kaifeng, Establish Relief Stations, and Provide Accommodation for Students

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 25th] A delegation of Henan natives residing in Nanjing petitioned the government to quickly allocate substantial funds for post-war disaster relief in Kaifeng. On the afternoon of the 25th, they visited Premier Weng Wenhao to present their petition. Weng Wenhao personally received them, and He Yingqin, Gu Zhenggang, Yu Dawei, Zhou Yichun, Zhu Jiahua, and others also participated in the explanation. The petition delegation made three demands: (1) Please allocate 500 billion yuan to help refugees and youth; (2) Send senior officials to Zhengzhou to personally handle the relief efforts; (3) Ensure the safety of Zhengzhou. Weng responded that the Executive Yuan had already allocated 45 billion yuan on the 25th and would send personnel to Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, and other places to handle relief matters. Regarding the requested 500 billion yuan, due to limited financial resources, it was actually quite difficult. The petition delegation insisted that at least 200 billion yuan should be allocated. Premier Weng agreed to increase it by another 50 billion yuan and would consider increasing it further based on the economic situation. Regarding relief matters, the relevant ministers replied as follows: (1) The government has decided to establish relief stations in Pukou, Xuzhou, Shangqiu, Hankou, and Zhengzhou; (2) Gu Zhenggang will personally fly to Zhengzhou to inspect the situation of the disaster victims and supervise the handling of relief efforts; (3) Refugees and students will be allowed to ride military vehicles free of charge; (4) Henan students arriving in Nanjing will be accommodated by the Ministry of Education.

### A Glimpse of the Tragic Situation When Kaifeng Became a Sea of Fire

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 25th] Chen, an official from the Henan Department of Education who escaped from Kaifeng after its fall, arrived in Nanjing on the 25th, becoming the first person to escape from the jaws of death to the capital. He left Kaifeng on the morning of the 20th. According to him: On the morning of the 17th, the bandits engaged the 5th and 7th Security Regiments at the Da Di in the southeast of Biancheng, resulting in fierce and tragic fighting. The security forces suffered heavy losses due to a lack of ammunition. When the bandits approached the southeastern suburbs in the evening, the citizens calmly assisted in the battle. On the 18th, our air force began to fly over the city to assist in the battle, and the buildings in Nanguan were completely destroyed by bombing, causing a large number of civilian deaths. The bandits' offensive did not abate in the slightest. A certain regiment of the 66th Division was routed by the bandits outside Xiaonanmen. Two regiments of the 119th Brigade were sent to reinforce the area, but they were soon broken through. After entering the city, the bandits proceeded along Waimahao Street, Muchang Street, Daxiaozhifang Street, and Congfu Pit, and detoured to the West Street of the Provincial Government to attack the City Defense Headquarters and the Provincial Government. Another force advanced from Nantujie through Gulou Street and Xufu Street to the back street of the Provincial Government to attack the Provincial Government. Chairman Liu and other civil and military officials firmly defended the Provincial Government, awaiting reinforcements. On the 20th, the Provincial Government was bombarded and caught fire. At the same time, many other places in the city were also bombed and caught fire. The situation was particularly tragic on West Street, back street and Gulou Street with many residents and students dying. When he left the city, the surviving residents were cowering among the ruins, their cries shaking the heavens. Furthermore, thirty-two students from Henan University also escaped to the capital.

### Another Victory on the Western Section of the Jiaoji Railway, National Army Enters Longshan, Vanguard of the Jinpu Railway Advances to the Vicinity of Jieshou

[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 25th] The National Army on the western section of the Jiaoji Railway achieved another victory. Starting on the evening of the 23rd, the bandits, with the Ninth and Bohai Columns and local Eighth Route Army units, attempted to break through the outer defenses of Jinan. The National Army adopted mobile tactics and lured the bandits to a favorable area between Licheng and Guodian before dusk on the 24th. The defending forces, with the assistance of a large number of reinforcements and artillery and air support, launched a full-scale counterattack against the bandits. The sound of machine guns and artillery roared, and the entire city of Jinan could hear it. By about 11:00 PM on the 24th, the bandits finally could not hold out and fled eastward. As of the afternoon of the 25th, the vanguard of the pursuing National Army had entered Longshan, and the bandits fled in the direction of Mingshui and Zhangqiu.

### Bandit Forces Outside Qinhuangdao Shift Westward, Changli Launches Defense Battle, National Army Firmly Defends the City and Stubbornly Awaits Reinforcements

[Our Correspondent in Qinhuangdao, 25th] The fighting in eastern Hebei on the 25th was most intense between Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe. The National Army captured Muyizhai, 10 kilometers southwest of Qinhuangdao on the north side of the railway, at noon and continued to encircle and attack Caigezhuang, northeast of Beidaihe. The bandits have been surrounded. The fighting outside Qinhuangdao began on the 24th, and the sound of gunfire has receded. The 11th Column of bandits, which was attacking the outer defenses of Qinhuangdao, shifted westward and joined forces with the bandits besieging Changli, launching a fierce attack on Changli. The defending forces in Changli were relatively weak. After a bloody battle with the bandits on the outer defenses, they withdrew from the Beishan Heights and the city's suburban bunkers at dusk to firmly defend the city. The bandits' artillery fire was fierce, causing considerable damage in the city and starting fires in many places. Communication with this area has been lost. There was still no definite news on the morning of the 25th. It is judged that the defending forces are likely stubbornly holding out in the underground tunnels, awaiting reinforcements. Houfengtai, Anshan, Shimen, and other stations west of Changli were captured by the bandits on the 24th. The Luan River Bridge was protected by the National Army and remained intact. On the morning of the 25th, a unit of reinforcements arriving in Qinhuangdao from Huludao landed and advanced from Qinhuangdao. The road crew also dispatched a vehicle to repair the road in order to rescue Changli.

[Our Correspondent in Tianjin, 25th] The defense battle of Changli is still being waged fiercely on the 25th.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] It is understood that the Chinese government hopes to purchase most of its military needs from the US surplus materials and the US Army Reserve Corps, rather than purchasing new goods from private manufacturers. Ambassador Gu Weijun has informed the State Department of this intention and requested that the US designate a special agency to handle the use of the US$125 million in military aid with the Chinese government.

[United Press, Washington, 24th] It is generally believed here that the news that the US ambassador is willing to resign and resume his position as president of Yenching University may be a sign that the US diplomatic policy is about to end a stage, because the period when the United States maintained open relations with Asian communism has ended.

### Interrogation of Leaked Secret Meeting News, Huge Disturbance in the Legislative Yuan, Decision to Form a Temporary Committee to Thoroughly Investigate

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 25th] During the morning meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 25th, the Nanjing Xinmin Daily published a review of the military situation at the secret meeting of the院 on the 24th, revealing the secret of the meeting without reservation, causing a huge disturbance. This issue was first raised orally by Xiang Jutan after the reporting of matters was completed. Chen Kewen and Zhang Daohang pointed out that the news of the secret meetings of the Finance, Finance, and Foreign Affairs committees had also been repeatedly leaked recently, and attention should be paid to them together. Other speaking members all advocated thoroughly investigating where the news was leaked from, and condemned the Xinmin Daily's biased recording technology for such secret news, with ulterior motives. Some even said that there were Communist bandit tail elements or Third International spies mixed into the Legislative Yuan. Secretary-General Zhang Yuantai immediately asked for permission from President Sun to stand up and declare: At the meeting on the 24th, there were absolutely no journalists present to interview, and the court stenographers were always strictly prohibited from contacting journalists, and guaranteed that if there was any dereliction of duty by the Secretariat, they would be fully responsible, hoping that the members would form a committee to investigate thoroughly in order to clarify the responsibility. At this point, the members' target of attack became more concentrated on the female member Deng Jixing alone. Wu Wangji advocated调阅the original manuscript of the news to辨认 the handwriting, and Xie Chengzi said: The Xinmin Daily wrote out the content of each member's speech, which could never be done by people outside the meeting, and accused Deng Jixing herself of "strictly prohibiting the Air Force from blindly bombing cities." The temporary motion was also prominently published, which was enough to affect morale and people's hearts. Deng defended herself on this point, but was booed by the meeting. President Sun then declared a break to calm the disturbance. After the meeting continued, President Sun explained that Deng should be allowed to speak, but said: "Committee Member Deng, please speak from the position of a member, not from the position of a newspaper owner." Deng then argued that although she was the person in charge of the Nanjing Xinmin Daily, she could not prohibit reporters from interviewing just because she was a member, and that the news about the secret meeting was not only published by Xinmin Daily on the 25th. Zhang Daofan said that no matter who leaked the secret news, it must be thoroughly investigated. Otherwise, if this continues, the Legislative Yuan will inevitably be regarded as naive and confused, and that freedom of the press is limited, and the政院 should also be responsible for investigating the source of the newspaper news. Then, female member Tan Tiwu spoke to defend Deng, with an arrogant attitude, far-fetched reasoning, and emphasized that male members should not bully female members, which was reprimanded by the majority of male and female members. At this point, the meeting demanded to stop the discussion. As a result of the vote, the matter was finally handed over to the Temporary Committee for investigation. Finally, President Sun stood up and addressed the meeting, stating briefly: The Xinmin Daily had the freedom to interview and publish, but military secrets were related to national security, and every citizen had the obligation not to leak them. The Xinmin Daily's headline clearly stated: "Legislative Yuan Military Secret Meeting," how could it be wantonly publicized? It should be known that in this military crisis of bandit suppression, the leakage of military secrets to a rebellious enemy is dangerous. Otherwise, why hold a secret meeting? He hoped that the members, reporters, and newspaper owners present would pay attention to this matter, in order to fulfill their national obligations and assist the government in keeping secrets. Finally, with the approval of 309 votes (435 members present), it was passed that each of the 21 standing committees should nominate one person to form a temporary committee (the committee member from the Criminal Law Committee would be appointed as the convener) for thorough investigation.

The expenditure portion of the budget prioritizes suppressing the rebellion, with military spending accounting for over 47% of the total. The next priority is transportation, focusing on economic construction, followed by education expenses, which account for 15% of the total proportion, in accordance with constitutional provisions. Social affairs are next, including relief efforts, accounting for a considerable proportion. Tax revenue constitutes the bulk of the revenue portion, especially commodity tax, which amounts to approximately 1 million billion yuan. Customs duties are second, at over 700,000 billion yuan, and direct taxes are approximately 400,000 billion yuan, totaling over 3 million billion yuan, with the remainder from other revenue. The compilation of this general budget fully demonstrates the government's efforts to achieve a balance between income and expenditure. After the proposal was presented at the political affairs meeting on the 25th, Chief Comptroller Xu Kan first reported on the compilation process of the expenditure portion, followed by Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu, who reported on the compilation process of the revenue portion, after a thorough discussion, it was passed.

Editorial

### Dewey Nominated as US Presidential Candidate

At the US Republican National Convention on the evening of the 24th, a vote was held to elect a presidential candidate. Those participating in the competition included New York Governor Dewey, Senator Taft, industrialist Stassen, diplomat Vandenberg, California Governor Warren, and Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Tokyo, MacArthur. They are all first-class figures in the United States, not only highly regarded within the Republican Party but also hoped for as presidential candidates by people at home and abroad. Although none of them received a majority in the first or second vote, by the third vote, as most of the candidates had abandoned their bids, Dewey received 1,094 votes and was elected, with no one voting against him. This is truly Dewey's supreme honor, making him Truman's only formidable opponent.

In our article "The Beginning of the American Political Season," we analyzed the American political situation and the competition among the parties, pointing out that the Republican Party had a better chance in this year's presidential election. However, with so many talented people within the Republican Party, we dared not prematurely predict who would be the future master of the White House. Now that Dewey has been nominated as the Republican presidential candidate, he must be confident that he will enter the White House. Indeed, there is not much difference between the Democratic and Republican parties on domestic and foreign policies. Whether it is Truman or Dewey, American national policy will not undergo major changes in principle. President Truman has also stated to the Soviet Union that regardless of the outcome of this year's election, the policy towards the Soviet Union will not change. However, there will inevitably be differences in the priorities of implementing national policies. Therefore, we are particularly interested in Dewey's views on China.

I remember that in February or March of this year, when the US government and public were hotly debating whether to aid Europe or China first, Dewey issued a "Policy Toward China" statement, advocating that China should be actively aided economically. The US Republican National Committee passed it and sent it to President Truman and Congress. In the statement, Dewey criticized the Democratic Party's policy toward China, saying: "The Truman administration not only lacks a policy to promote peace but also contributes to the Soviet Union's aggression around the world. In the Far East, the US government sacrifices China and reaches a compromise with Stalin, allowing him to control Northeast China." Recently, Dewey has been making campaign speeches everywhere, all based on this. On May 26, in a speech in New York, he said, "We cannot withhold the aid that China needs, we cannot win lasting peace." Therefore, we look forward to the future, and no matter what the US policy toward China will be, it will only become more active. As long as we can uphold the principle of "self-reliance" and constantly strengthen ourselves, Dewey will not disappoint us if he is elected president.

### Tightening Credit and Restricting Issuance

Yesterday, prices in the Shanghai market rose frantically. In the afternoon, the retail price of rice nearly hit 20 million yuan, and the prices of various major commodities also rose by 20-30%. People were alarmed and lived in constant fear. However, as of this writing, we have not heard of any emergency measures being prepared by the central authorities. It seems that they are watching this runaway horse, helpless, and letting it run wild. Not only will ordinary people feel an increasing threat to their survival, but everyone feels that the government must not continue to be perfunctory.

According to relevant financial sources, the government will still focus on tightening credit, and selling US aid materials is its main method. Some even say that as long as 60 million US dollars worth of materials are sold, all the legal currency can be recovered, which seems very optimistic. If that is the case, why not sell them? Secondly, there is the promotion of treasury bonds, but the effectiveness is obvious. We believe that to truly tighten credit, one should start by immediately restricting currency issuance.

Speaking of the promotion of short-term treasury bonds, the first to be piloted were types A and B. The term for type C is set at one week, which is actually equivalent to the previously banned "delivery trading," the only difference being that one is stocks and the other is treasury bonds. We need to study whether the sales of treasury bonds will increase rapidly after delivery trading is restored, so as to achieve the purpose of tightening credit and recovering legal currency.

Since treasury bonds were listed, their sales have reportedly improved. For example, on the 23rd, in a single day, they reached 117.492 billion, which is a considerable amount. However, there is too much floating capital, making it difficult to absorb. The recent soaring prices, especially the surge yesterday, clearly deviate from the norm and cannot be effectively addressed by the usual methods of tightening credit. Although the authorities have expanded the issuance locations to the five major cities of Nanjing, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Chongqing, and have expanded the issuing institutions from the National Bank to the stock exchange, and even want to extend the terms of types A and B to type C, which is equivalent to delivery trading, it seems doubtful whether relying solely on this method can effectively tighten credit and effectively suppress prices.

The purpose of issuing treasury bonds is originally to tighten credit, so that a part of the legal currency can be recovered. Now that the policy has been determined, it is natural that every effort should be made to promote sales. At this time of runaway prices, which cannot be contained, we also place deep hopes on it. However, if the reasons why sales were not smooth in the past still exist, then how much power will the stimulus caused by the change to delivery trading have? It is unwise to overestimate it. Moreover, dealing with inflation, dealing with the machinations of floating capital, and dealing with the positive effect of price fluctuations are not just about the numbers shown in the treasury bond sales, but whether this strategy can actually be effective. Therefore, while promoting treasury bonds, we must still stop expansion, so that the expected effect can be achieved. Otherwise, issuing more treasury bonds will only temporarily increase the state treasury's revenue, and its role will still be limited to finance rather than monetary policy. Moreover, with relatively high interest rates, the new treasury bonds that will be reissued when they mature will inevitably increase. The state treasury's burden will increase, and in the end, it will have to resort to issuance, which will further inflate the currency, fill the capital with floating capital, and prices may become even more uncontrollable!

At the end of May, Minister Wang announced a total of 135 trillion, which is almost double the figure of 70 trillion at the end of March. This proves that the current inflation is still progressing rapidly. If this bad trend cannot be quickly curbed, even if the issuance of type C treasury bonds is successful, and a small portion of floating capital can be recovered in the stock exchange market, what benefit will it have for general prices and the general economy? Moreover, what is taken in by the left hand is released by the right hand, and the floating capital in the Northeast, North China, Central China, and West China are flocking to Shanghai from all directions. This is just as a certain financial authority said, "When the flood is rampant, building dikes will not be effective." Moreover, just looking at the listing of type C treasury bonds, its effectiveness may not even be comparable to the so-called building of dikes, let alone flood prevention. Therefore, we believe that tightening credit should be a lesson from the past and start from the big picture. For example, the proposal by Municipal Councilor Xu Yongzuo and others to organize an issuance supervision committee to curb inflation seems to be a fundamental remedy. If this is not done, and one only focuses on minor details, such as the rumored creation of type C treasury bonds, diverting floating capital to the south, and temporarily selling materials, it is nothing more than a self-consoling method of treating the symptom rather than the cause. Based on past performance, how much contribution will it make to tightening credit and recovering legal currency?

### Rental Disputes Occur in Tieling

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 22nd] In the Liaoning Provincial Department of Finance's expanded spring plowing plan, the area of rice paddies in Tieling can increase by 8,000 mu compared to last year. Currently, because Korean farmers and landlords have rental disputes, the work of assisting plowing with tractors has been temporarily suspended. In the rice paddies in the Shatuozi area of Tieling, most landlords are adopting a wait-and-see attitude and are unwilling to invest in spring plowing. Therefore, Korean farmers applied for tractors to assist in plowing. The tractor management office believed that most of the applicant Korean farmers were poor farmers, so it allowed them to be exempt from fuel costs and provided free plowing services, with good results. After plowing 4,000 mu of land, the landlords came forward to compete for benefits, demanding that the tractors plow for them and that they receive more benefits during the autumn harvest, which aroused opposition from the Korean farmers, who demolished the small bridges in the fields, preventing the tractors from passing and unable to continue working. Currently, Yang Kai, a special commissioner for spring plowing supervision specially sent by the Political Committee's Department of Farmland Water Conservancy, is responsible for mediation. The Suppression General Political Committee believes that the Liaoning Provincial Government's promulgated measures for the use of wasteland have been obstructed by local forces and have not been smoothly implemented. It has ordered the Liaoning Provincial Government to strictly order all counties to allocate uncultivated wasteland to poor farmers for cultivation in accordance with the provisions of these measures, and landlords must not disobey, forming rental disputes and affecting increased production.

### Rice Prices Rise Frequently Everywhere: Running Wild Like a Loose Horse; Authorities Hold Emergency Meeting to Maintain People's Food Supply

### Plutocrats in Japan

— Wu Jiatang

Already a Dishonorable Term

The term "plutocrat" is already a dishonorable one in today's Japan. If one were to joke with a Japanese person, one might declare him to be a plutocrat. The effect would be as swift as calling him an old militarist.

Japanese plutocrats such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo, were in the past allied with Japan's aggressive forces, promoting policies of invasion and trampling all over East Asia. Therefore, after Japan's surrender, the plutocrats were placed alongside Japan's military and war potential on the list of things to be eliminated. This was because the Allied Supreme Commander knew that if the plutocrats were allowed to continue to exist, Japan would once again embark on the old path of aggression. At the same time, from a political and economic point of view, the plutocrats represented the concentration of wealth and its potential power. Japan's people are now leaning left, and the unequal distribution of wealth could at any time cause a major explosion, allowing the Japanese Communist Party to take the opportunity to rise amidst the chaos.

The Allied Supreme Commander's handling of the plutocrat problem seems to focus on a systematic method of dissolution. Of course, the main starting point is to dissolve these large wealth groups as soon as possible. However, in addition to this goal, there are several other aspects that must be seriously considered. First, the dissolution work must be carried out with both courage and caution, so as not to cause chaos in the entire economy, allowing the communist forces to take advantage of the situation. Because today's Japan under Allied Supreme Commander occupation does not outwardly show the plutocrats' past dominance over everything in Japan, their past influence was deeply rooted and certainly controlled the economic destiny of every Japanese person. Therefore, the Allied Supreme Commander, in dealing with this major issue related to the entire national economy of Japan, must act cautiously. Although some people advocate using the method of "cutting through a tangled mess with a quick knife" to eliminate the existing system, in order to avoid causing economic paralysis, it is necessary to proceed step by step and promote it in a planned manner.

Some outside observers have criticized the Allied Supreme Commander for not dissolving the plutocrats quickly enough. However, it must be understood that the Allied Supreme Commander is subject to the control of the Far Eastern Commission when carrying out its work. In addition to eliminating Japan's military and war potential, the Far Eastern Commission also instructed the Allied Supreme Commander to implement a basic policy. This instruction is: (1) To assist the Japanese people in developing economic and cultural relations with other countries in a democratized society, in order to meet their reasonable individual and national needs, and to allow them to live in peace with other countries forever. (2) To allow Japan to maintain its industries for making a living, and to use this value to pay fair reparations in kind, but industries that could rearm her are not included. For this purpose, Japan may be allowed to obtain raw materials. Japan will also be allowed to participate in world trade relations once it joins. Based on this meaning, the Allied Supreme Commander passed a Holding Company Liquidation Act in January of the year before last, and at the same time established a Holding Company Liquidation Committee to liquidate major holding companies. The work in the first year was to thoroughly investigate the internal affairs of 41 holding companies and 1,200 first-tier subsidiaries, and designate them as "restricted" companies. This meant that the shareholders of these companies could not freely withdraw and transfer their shares to others in order to conceal their ownership. In addition, more than 2,000 "control groups" and associations were also strictly investigated, and the Japanese government was ordered to dissolve all of these industrial associations and abolish all laws and regulations that supported them. Japan's control groups are similar in nature to our country's trade associations. Within their own industry, they set prices, allocate raw materials, determine uniform wages, limit the output of different industries, and divide up the markets of each industry. At the end of the year before last, 63 companies were liquidated, and another 20 were liquidated last year. These companies include the industries of Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and other famous plutocrats. At the same time, under the decentralization law, 325 companies in the industrial sector, whose activities in the past involved every aspect of the lives of the Japanese people, will now also be dissolved. Among them, 144 companies will be forced to separate from all of their subsidiaries.

Existing statistics show that these designated control companies own a total of 1.58 billion shares, with a value of 6.3 billion yen. The Holding Company Liquidation Committee has taken over all of these assets, and has kept a large number of shares of these companies and their subsidiaries in custody. Liquidating these companies requires in-depth research into their finances and structure, which is a long and laborious reconnaissance work. At the same time, the Allied Supreme Commander is taking steps to prevent these large companies from rising again and controlling the Japanese economy. Anti-trust legislation was proposed in the second year of the occupation, and became law on July 14 of last year. It prohibits trusts, combinations, and cartels, and establishes a Fair Trade Commission to implement the content of this law. It also stipulates that no more than 100 former industrial association officials can participate in a new company. And the leaders of its subsidiaries are limited to one person when organizing a new company. Of course, the work of the Allied Supreme Commander in dissolving the power of the Japanese plutocrats will not be easy in the future. They are currently trying to sell the shares received by the Liquidation Committee. Changing the entire economic system of Japan still requires time, patience, determination, and wisdom.

### U.S. Republican Convention Unanimously Nominates Dewey as Presidential Candidate; Dewey Advocates Large-Scale Aid to China

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] New York, 25th Broadcast: Dewey nominated California Governor Warren today to participate in the vice presidential election in November of this year. Warren indicated acceptance.

[United Press International, Philadelphia, 25th] If Dewey leads the Republican Party to victory in the November election, the position of Secretary of State may be filled by his foreign policy advisor Dulles. According to Dulles's position, which is the same as Vandenberg's, he has always advocated an internationalist approach.

[Reuters, Philadelphia, 24th] Although Dewey may win, he will have to wait until the fourth ballot to obtain the necessary majority.

[U.S. News Service, Philadelphia, 24th] The Republican National Convention tonight, in the third ballot, unanimously nominated Dewey as the U.S. presidential candidate. Dewey, the governor of New York, will face the candidates of the Democratic Party and other parties in the November election. When the states were being called and New Hampshire was reached, Dewey had already obtained a majority of the 1,094 votes at the convention. New Hampshire's eight votes brought Dewey's total to 554. He only needed 548 votes to be elected. Dewey encountered considerable resistance in the first ballot from a coalition against Dewey. After the first ballot, he intensified his activities in the second ballot and finally won in the third ballot. At the beginning of the third round of nominations, Senator Taft was the first of the main contenders to drop out and endorse Dewey. Later, California Governor Warren also announced his withdrawal, followed by another candidate, Stetson, who also withdrew and urged a unanimous vote for Dewey.

[Associated Press, Philadelphia, 24th] Dewey attended the Republican convention tonight and delivered a speech to the cheering delegates, accepting the nomination as the U.S. presidential candidate for the next term. His words vowed to promote national unity internally and build a world order of justice and peace externally. Dewey said, "At this time, a Republican must contribute his life to promoting human freedom. If the world is half free and half enslaved, we must strive peacefully to help people everywhere gain freedom." Regarding domestic unity, Dewey said, "I dare to guarantee that after January 20 next year, the U.S. government will show a sense of shared purpose."

[Central News Agency, Philadelphia, 24th] Dewey, who was elected as the Republican presidential candidate, expressed great concern about the situation in our country when he met with the reporter of this agency alone. Dewey firmly supports large-scale financial and material assistance to China. He severely criticized the State Department's limited aid plan for China. Dewey expressed special concern for the war turmoil in our country. He hoped that after the Republican Party comes to power, it can provide China with aid of the same kind and in large quantities. Dewey is a staunch supporter of the bipartisan foreign policy. He strongly opposes Soviet expansionism, but he has opposed the government using legislation to suppress the Communist Party.

[United Press International, Washington, 24th] Democratic members of Congress agreed with President Truman's praise of Dewey as the "strongest" Republican presidential candidate. It is rumored that Truman believes that Dewey is the most difficult person to defeat among all the Republican candidates.

[United Press International, Tokyo, 25th] MacArthur congratulated Dewey today on his nomination as the Republican candidate, saying that this is a "brilliant choice completed according to the best American traditions, giving guarantees and confidence not only to the American people but also to all freedom-loving people in the world."

### Warsaw Conference Issues Declaration Demanding Establishment of All-German Government, Speedy Conclusion of Peace Treaty Stipulating Withdrawal of Allied Occupation Forces, Four-Power Control of the Ruhr, and Elimination of German Military Potential

[United Press International, Prague, 25th] Warsaw diplomatic sources notified United Press International by long distance telephone on the 25th that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had left Warsaw for Moscow at 8:50 PM Greenwich time.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 25th] Authorities here believe that the Soviet Union has already established an East German state, temporarily headquartered in Leipzig. An official announcement is expected to be made on the evening of the 25th when Molotov and other foreign ministers of Eastern European countries leave Warsaw. "The Eight-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference issued a communiqué this morning condemning the Western Allies for violating all agreements relating to Germany,

and demanding: (1) Taking measures to ensure the disarmament of Germany; (2) Stipulating a definite period for the Four-Power control of the Ruhr industrial area and prohibiting the restoration of German military potential; (3) Establishing a temporary all-German government; (4) Formulating a peace treaty with Germany based on the Potsdam decisions; (5) Formulating measures to enable Germany to fulfill its reparations obligations to the countries it invaded. The communiqué also condemned a group of German elements for plotting to undermine the German-Polish border on the Oder-Neisse line, calling that border an inviolable line of peace. The 2,000-word communiqué accused the Six-Nation Conference in London of attempting to use Germany, especially the Ruhr area, to achieve British and American military and strategic goals, and also criticized the British, American, and French enticement of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.

### Cominform Simultaneously Convenes General Assembly

[Reuters, London, 24th] The full assembly of the Communist Information Bureau (Cominform) is expected to be held immediately after the Warsaw Conference of Foreign Ministers. A French Communist Party official in Paris said that the Cominform conference will be held after the Warsaw Conference, but did not specify whether the meeting place is also Warsaw. According to the Czech official news agency, history will certainly show that the Warsaw Conference is a manifestation of the Slavic countries' efforts for peace. The news agency also said that Czech Foreign Minister Clementis had put forward concrete proposals at the meeting.

### Military Government of Three Western German Occupation Zones to Be Reorganized

[United Press International, Berlin, 25th] U.S. Military Governor for Germany, Lieutenant General Clay, organized a committee on the 25th, based on the three countries, to reorganize the military government. The British and French commanders have already appointed committees of the same nature.

### Four Powers Launch Cold War, Situation in Berlin Tense, Soviet Union Announces End of Joint Control

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 25th Broadcast: The Soviet side has begun formal actions today in an attempt to force the Western Allies to withdraw from Berlin. The Soviet zone of Berlin has been ordered not to allocate food to residents of the Western zone. The British and French countries responded with quick measures, also ordering a ban on the supply of food to the Soviet zone.

[United Press International, Berlin, 25th] The Soviet Union's "Cold War" strategy took a fascinating about-face turn on the 25th. Allied officials in Helmstedt announced that the Soviet military commander in Marienfelde said that freight trains from the West to Berlin could resume running from the 28th. If so, then the 2.5 million German residents in West Berlin would not starve, and the Soviet Union would abandon its policy of expelling the Allies from Berlin. Therefore, on the surface, the Soviet Union's final move will once again ease the Berlin crisis.

[United Press International, Berlin, 25th] Soviet Commander-in-Chief of the Occupation Forces in Germany, Sokolovsky, announced today that the Four-Power rule of Berlin has come to an end. The possibility of the Western Allies being expelled from Berlin sooner or later can also be seen for the first time. As the Soviet Union and the Western Allies launch a diplomatic and economic war in Berlin, the 2.5 million Germans in the U.S., British, and French occupation zones are caught in the crossfire between the two major forces. Responsible officials are studying in detail the U.S. Military Governor General Clay's statement on the 24th: "As far as we are concerned, unless we resort to military force, don't think about expelling us from Berlin." They pointed out that the phrases "as far as we are concerned" and "the Germans are also suffering" indicate the possibility of abandoning Berlin. A high-ranking official felt that if the Allied forces continued to be stationed in Berlin and made the Germans in their zone suffer from hunger, the Western countries might withdraw from Berlin.

[Reuters, Berlin, 25th] The Cold War in Berlin has become increasingly tense due to several actions and counter-actions by the Four Powers. A U.S. spokesman also said that the Soviet Union's order to implement currency reform is the final stage of Bolshevizing the Soviet zone. Residents in the British and American zones of Berlin began exchanging new marks this morning, making the division of Berlin a fait accompli. The Berlin Central Food Bureau, located in the Soviet zone, was ordered by the Soviet authorities to no longer distribute food supplied by the Soviet zone to the Western zone.

### U.S. Experts Go to West Germany to Study Steel Production Increase

### Unless Military Force Is Used, Britain Will Never Withdraw from Berlin, Foreign Secretary Bevin Declares in the House of Commons

[Reuters, London, 25th] Foreign Secretary Bevin announced today that Britain is taking a consistent stand with the U.S. and France on the Berlin crisis, solemnly stating that only war can expel the Western Powers from Berlin. In answering questions in the House of Commons about the Berlin crisis, Bevin said that a dangerous situation has arisen in Berlin, where demonstrations are clearly forcing the Western Allies to withdraw from Berlin. Fortunately, the British authorities there have remained calm, which is gratifying.

We are in Berlin by right, and the Soviet Union has the ability to force us to leave, but it also knows that it must create a situation of conflict in order to force us to withdraw from Berlin. However, we will never withdraw from Berlin, and even if we are forced to withdraw, we will still return to Berlin. The Western Powers have notified the Soviet side that they are willing to allow the new currency in the Soviet zone to circulate universally in Berlin under the principle of Four-Power joint control, but the Soviet side insists that this matter can only be controlled independently by the Soviet authorities. If we were to accept this, it would be tantamount to giving up our rights in Berlin, and Britain will never agree to a new currency system in which the power to decide the amount of issuance is in the hands of others. The Soviet Union's attitude has forced the Western Powers to have no other way to go but to implement their own plans. Bevin went on to deny that the Soviet side had set up barrier balloons in the Berlin air corridor, and he did not believe that the situation would remain as unsettling as it is now forever. He revealed that the British, American, and French Powers have a general agreement in Berlin and maintain constant contact on the rapidly developing situation. When a Conservative member asked to what extent Britain and the U.S. would consider using force, Bevin said that he did not intend to say anything other than what he had already stated.

### U.S. Condemns Soviet Union for Violating Existing Agreements

### France's Attitude Is Firm

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that France has a firm will to continue to stay in Berlin, and that it will not change due to the current Cold War. We can implement retaliation, we can cut off the supply of tap water and gas to the Soviet zone of Berlin, and the amount cut off can be even greater than the amount the Soviet Union cuts off to the Western zone.

### Far East Commission Passes Resolution Approving Investigation of Japanese Industry by Various Countries

[United Press International, Washington, 24th] The Far East Commission held a secret meeting tonight and passed a proposal by Australia to allow countries to send representatives to investigate the progress of Japanese industry. The United States had once expressed opposition. This decision actually opened the door to foreign investigation of Japanese industry, inventions, and manufacturing after the war, and largely included the right to investigate weapons and ammunition. Japan's textile machinery and cutting-edge fishing nets are of greatest interest. The Far East Commission will instruct MacArthur to promptly comply with the resolution.

### Brief Biography of Dewey, U.S. Republican Presidential Candidate

— Our Newspaper Archives

Dewey, the U.S. Republican presidential candidate, was unanimously confirmed, and this is his third time running for president. In 1940, some people tried to nominate Dewey as a presidential candidate, but the Republican convention decided on Willkie instead. This was his first failure. In 1944, Dewey was nominated as the Republican presidential candidate, but he failed again in the election. Although Dewey failed twice, he has the spirit of perseverance and is running for president for the third time.

Dewey was born in Owosso, Michigan in 1902. After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1923, he transferred to Columbia University to study law, graduating in 1925. He traveled to Europe and, after returning to his country, practiced law. From 1931, he served as a prosecutor in a district of New York. In 1935, he was appointed as a special prosecutor to expel hooligans in New York City and fight against the environment of evil forces, gaining considerable fame. In 1937, he was elected as county prosecutor. The following year, he was nominated by the Republican Party as a candidate for governor of New York, but he failed to be elected. In 1942, he was elected as the governor of New York State. In the 1946 New York State gubernatorial election, Dewey was re-elected.

Dewey lives on a farm in Pawling, New York, and has a happy family, a wife, and two children. During his tenure as governor of New York, he fully demonstrated his talent. He raised 62.3 million in postwar reconstruction funds, reduced income tax by 40 percent, strived for retirement benefits for veterans, arranged housing and education for veterans, reformed the New York State public health program, increased the salaries of public education personnel, promoted a bill banning public employees from striking, and so on, showing his good political achievements.

Dewey's political views: the current high cost of living is caused by inflation, while stimulating increased industrial production. He advocates reducing government spending, stopping speculation, encouraging savings, and putting the economy back on track. In terms of diplomacy: he hopes to establish a world of strong and free nations, so he should do his best to help Europe's revival, and promote Europe to become a great federation of free nations as a barrier to lasting peace to break the war crisis instigated by ambitious people.

Dewey advocates for closely aiding China. Last year, Dewey gave full explanations in several public speeches. He believes that China's current situation is very serious. If the entire China is lost, then all of Asia and Western Europe will be lost along with it, and the United States will become isolated. Therefore, the only way to benefit the United States is to assist China as soon as possible and resolve China's current predicament.

### City Government Holds Emergency Meeting to Discuss Measures to Suppress and Stabilize Prices; Economic Police to Conduct Comprehensive Inventory of Warehouse Materials Starting Today; Police Chief Yu Addresses the Issue of Abolishing Economic Police

Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan of the city council, citing the soaring prices in the city, especially yesterday's sharp increase, which poses a serious threat to the lives of ordinary people, and the government's failure to take effective measures to curb them, specifically suggested that Mayor Wu convene the heads of relevant municipal agencies to hold a meeting to discuss measures to suppress and stabilize prices. This suggestion has been approved by Mayor Wu, and it has been decided to convene an emergency meeting at the city government at 2:00 PM today. Council Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, Garrison Commander Xuan, Social Affairs Director Wu, Police Chief Yu, and others will be invited to attend. The results of the discussion will be reported to today's council meeting.

[Report from this Newspaper] Police Chief Yu Shuping of the Municipal Police Department, regarding the abolition of the Economic Police Brigade, stated to reporters yesterday: Before receiving orders from the city government, he will continue to be responsible for monitoring the markets of various industries as before, and will further strengthen the work. He has also decided to start inspecting the materials in warehouses throughout the city today, and severely crack down on hoarding and speculation, in order to ruthlessly combat the price surge that occurred yesterday.

Chief Yu also issued a written statement yesterday regarding the Economic Police Team and the extension of curfew hours, as follows: "(1) I regret that the Economic Police Team of this bureau has not been able to achieve the ideal state. However, in the past, the Economic Police have made some minor contributions to suppressing the straight-line rise in prices and打击奸商市僧. The establishment of the Economic Police Team of this bureau was based on the provisions of Article 6, Paragraph 9 of the revised and promulgated organizational regulations of this bureau on April 15, 1946, regarding the execution of economic control laws and regulations, and began to perform its duties. On September 30, 1947, it was submitted to the city government for approval. In November 1947, the Police Headquarters of the Ministry of Interior issued Telegraph No. 19676 to coordinate with the General Outline for Mobilization and Suppression of Rebellion, and formulated the Implementation Plan for the Central Work of the Police during the Suppression of Rebellion. According to the provisions of Item 5 of ensuring local security in the plan, the Capital and Municipal Police Bureaus should establish economic sections or economic police brigades as needed according to the circumstances, and Telegraph No. 37 Mi Hai 010128 was issued to strictly handle the matter. Therefore, there is no doubt about the legal basis of the Economic Police. As for the issue of its abolition, if it is indeed the will of the people, it is expected that the higher authorities will consider it. However, even if it is abolished in the future, the central government will not abolish the economic control laws and regulations that punish speculative merchants during this period of suppression of rebellion. In order to make these laws and regulations effective, it is still necessary to establish a strong and effective enforcement agency. Although this bureau has the task of assisting in the implementation of economic control laws as part of its duties for maintaining public security, it is not the economic authority in charge. Maintaining general public security is already a heavy burden, and if the economic authority in charge can be responsible for direct enforcement in the future, and this bureau remains in an assisting position, it would be highly appreciated.

### Entertainment Venues Should Not Extend Hours

(2) Regarding the resolution of the police affairs subcommittee of the City Council to extend curfew hours, there may be some errors in the wording of the original proposal. This is because there is currently no curfew regulation in this city, and what the councilors proposed was actually the extension of business hours for special businesses such as dance halls, theaters, restaurants, clubs, and other public entertainment venues. The reasons for this resolution are unclear, but during this period of mobilization and suppression of rebellion, the central government has repeatedly ordered frugality. At the same time, at a time when bandits are rampant everywhere and society is unstable, extending the business hours of entertainment venues is definitely not appropriate. I sincerely hope that the councilors will adhere to the principle of separation of powers and consider the current serious situation, and give serious consideration and assistance to this measure taken by this bureau for the benefit of the public and local public security."

### Garrison Commander Xuan Discusses Current Affairs, Strongly Advocates Thorough Reform; Economic Root Cause Lies in Inequality; Politics Should Strive to Win Over the Masses

Xuan Tiewu, commander of the Songhu Garrison, gave a speech to reporters at 4:00 PM on the 25th, severely criticizing current malpractices and strongly advocating thorough reform. Xuan pointed out bluntly that the economic and political crises are becoming increasingly serious, and the military is divorced from politics and economics. If improvements are not made quickly and the matter is delayed further, the consequences will be unimaginable. Xuan first discussed the price problem, saying: The way to save the economic crisis is to address the root cause. In the past, with limited economic inspection personnel engaged in the inspection of gold and banknotes on the black market and hoarding and speculation, it was difficult to achieve the expected results. Therefore, the central and local governments and the people must thoroughly review the root causes of the current economic ills, and then determine the countermeasures to address the root cause. The current economic ills can be summed up in one word: "inequality." Social wealth is becoming increasingly concentrated, a few people live extravagantly, and most people cannot even get enough to eat. Under such circumstances, how can we talk about economic suppression of rebellion? Therefore, to seek economic reform, one "equal" character is enough.

### Organizing and Training the Masses to Protect Local Tyrants Is Impossible

When discussing political matters, Xuan reviewed the strategies of the communists, saying that the party, government, military, economy, education, and culture are thoroughly integrated to achieve a true total war. However, on our side, the work of organizing and training the masses to develop self-defense forces has not been very effective. The main reason is that it "lacks a sufficient political significance." Under the continuous exploitation by corrupt officials, local bullies, and evil gentry, it is almost impossible to organize the general public to protect the interests of corrupt officials, local bullies, and evil gentry. They all know that if the communists come, the targets of the cleansing and struggle will definitely not be them. Therefore, "winning over the masses and winning back people's hearts" is an urgent measure for political reform. Xuan said: The military cannot be separated from politics and economics and stand alone. The military must be based on a clear political system and a stable economy in order to become strong and achieve the task of defeating the enemy.

### Total War Should Be Implemented Immediately

Yi replied to the question about the security situation in the Songhu garrison area, saying: We are now dispatching more naval patrols, and coastal defenses have been strengthened. There should be no problems. He also revealed that the provinces south of the Yangtze River may implement the total war plan earlier, but it is estimated that the earliest time will still be after the Mid-Autumn Festival. He said: We should frankly admit that the reason why the provinces north of the Yangtze River have reached today's situation is that the total war plan was implemented too late. Now, the provinces south of the Yangtze River must learn from the lessons of the northern provinces and immediately implement total war, and engage in close coordination between military, political, and economic measures, in order to achieve the goals of eliminating hidden bandits militarily, thoroughly reforming the political style, organizing and training the masses, first stabilizing the economy, and then establishing a new system to protect the minimum living standards of the people. In this way, the Yangtze River can become a "golden city," and the expansion of the anti-communist military in the north of the Yangtze River can be expected in the near future.

### Heads of Five Agencies Deny Being Directors of the Military Friendship Association

Songhu Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu met with reporters at 4:00 PM yesterday and denied holding the title of director of the Military Friendship Association. The Shanghai Garrison Commander Chuan Zhengmo, Wusong Fortress Commander Shao Baichang, Shanghai Port Commander Zhou Lixing, and Shanghai Supply Director Chen Qian of the Joint Logistics Headquarters, who jointly handled the Liu case, also made the same statement.

### Limited-Price Movie Tickets Raised to 100,000, Other Seat Prices Unchanged

[Report from this Newspaper] The 60,000-yuan limited-price seats in the city's first-run movie theaters will be raised to 100,000 yuan starting today. The number of limited-price seats is still stipulated to be 30%. Other seat prices will remain at the same three levels of 150,000, 200,000, and 300,000 yuan. This proposal was originally scheduled to be discussed at yesterday's municipal meeting, but since the municipal meeting was not held, it was directly approved by Mayor Wu. The implementation of the new limited price will only last for five days, and will be adjusted uniformly starting on the first of next month. It is said that the adjustment method will use this month's ticket price as a benchmark, and increase accordingly based on the percentage increase in the cost of living index for staff announced at the end of each month.

### Taxi Association Requests to Negotiate Prices Independently

The Taxi Association requests the abolition of price controls and permission to negotiate prices independently in order to maintain operations and avoid deficits, due to the current soaring prices of all goods and different market prices in the morning and evening. It is now reported that the Public Utilities Bureau has scheduled a meeting with representatives of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 10:00 AM today in the bureau's conference room to discuss the case.

### Newly Appointed Director of the China Trust Bureau, Cheng Yuanfan, Takes Office

### National Assembly Delegates Zhu Fengwei and Others Call for Replacing Conscription with Enlistment

National Assembly Delegates Zhu Fengwei, Li Ximou, Chu Fengzhang, and others, citing the poor military service system and the concurrent system of conscription and voluntary enlistment, which has led to unscrupulous military service personnel colluding with arms dealers and township chiefs allocating funds to buy substitutes for military service, with each substitute soldier requiring 30 to 40 shi of white rice, while the conscripted soldiers are all unemployed vagrants who are not fit for combat, desert immediately after enlisting, and repeatedly change their names to enlist again, causing the people to suffer, rural areas to go bankrupt, call for replacing conscription with enlistment in order to protect the country's foundation and reassure the people.

### Business Community Sends Another Telegram to the Ministry of Finance Opposing the Collection of Property Tax

[Report from this Newspaper] The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Industrial Preparatory Committee yesterday again jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan Ministry of Finance, stating that the Shanghai business community is determined to unanimously oppose the collection of property tax.

### Sale of Silver and Copper Coins Should Not Be Confiscated

[Report from this Newspaper] The Ministry of Judicial Administration recently stated that the practice of trading and selling silver coins is becoming increasingly prevalent, and there are more and more people engaged in selling them, which has resulted in many violations of the criminal code. The Municipal District Attorney's Office received instructions from the ministry yesterday, stating that "those who privately transport and sell silver or copper coins in various places do not constitute a crime, and the silver or copper coins should not be confiscated. Those who intend to sell but have not yet exchanged them for legal tender should also be considered as not constituting a crime."

### All Musicians in Dance Halls Demand a Salary Increase from Employers

[Report from this Newspaper] All the musicians in the city's dance halls have recently jointly demanded a 100% salary increase from the dance hall employers. Their reasons are: Although Western musicians currently have an average monthly salary of about 80 million yuan, because their families are far away in the Philippines, if they are converted into US dollars and remitted back to support their families, the amount is very small and insufficient to maintain their lives. The average monthly salary for Chinese musicians is currently about 50 million yuan, which is also insufficient due to the high cost of living. Therefore, they have requested dance halls without air conditioning equipment to increase salaries monthly according to the cost of living index, and dance halls with air conditioning equipment to increase salaries by 100%. This matter is being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau.

### Oil Shortage Temporarily Resolved, All Stations to Supply as Much as Possible Starting Today, Refueling Still Subject to Regulations

[Report from this Newspaper] The city's severe gasoline shortage has been resolved after Mayor Wu has worked hard to find solutions for several days. After holding an emergency meeting on the 23rd, he contacted the Import and Export Management Committee and the Central Bank yesterday to facilitate the completion of the foreign exchange settlement procedures for 400,000 gallons of gasoline by various oil companies on the same day. Therefore, gas stations will be able to supply as much as possible starting today.

According to the Gasoline Allocation Committee: Vehicle refueling must still be handled in accordance with the refueling methods: (1) Refueling is only allowed once every three days. Each car is allowed to refuel up to 10 gallons, each truck is allowed to refuel up to 20 gallons, and each motorcycle is allowed to refuel up to 2 gallons. (2) Gas stations will not supply gasoline to cars that have already purchased the regulated amount of oil. (3) Cars that are being repaired or cannot be driven are not allowed to be towed to gas stations to refuel. The municipal government has specifically designated the Public Utilities Bureau and the Police Department to strictly enforce the above methods, and will dispatch a large number of inspectors to gas stations to inspect the refueling situation. If it is found that refueling is not done in accordance with the regulations, the oil purchase certificate will be revoked and never issued again.

### Studying Effective Countermeasures to Avoid a Repeat of Panic Buying

It is learned that the city authorities have applied to the central government to increase the city's gasoline quota, or reallocate gasoline quotas across the country to make it more reasonable. If the total quota cannot be increased, the city's car oil allocation will inevitably be reduced. As for the reduction method, we have also requested instructions from the central government. In order to avoid a repeat of the panic buying, the authorities are studying effective countermeasures: (1) Request the Central Bank to allow the city's gasoline to be settled once a month. If this method is approved by the central government, the price of gasoline can be prevented from being adjusted as before. (2) Mandatorily stipulate gas stations for car owners based on their occupation or location, dispersing the congestion at major gas stations. (This method has many difficulties and is difficult to implement.)

### Han Neipo Accused of Assaulting Referee, Only Plaintiff Appears in Court

[Report from this Newspaper] The district attorney's office held a court hearing yesterday on the case of Han Neipo of the Donghua Football Team assaulting a referee. Only the plaintiff, Jiang Yinseng, appeared in court. Han Neipo went to Hong Kong and another referee, Shen Huichun, did not appear in court. The hearing was adjourned to another date.

### Weng Zhong's Relocation: No Problem, MGM Expresses Willingness to Give Away for Free

[Report from this Newspaper] The issue of relocating the stone Weng Zhong statue next to the racecourse has rarely been raised since it was found that the land belonged to the MGM Film Company, and the pious men and women who go to burn incense and worship have returned to their old ways. In fact, if the municipal authorities can not shirk their responsibility, the relocation of the two stone Weng Zhong statues is not a problem. The MGM side is willing to "donate" them for free. MGM's Shanghai manager specifically told this newspaper reporter yesterday: If a committee or something is established that does not aim at wealth but relocates the stone Weng Zhong statues to other places where the public can continue to worship them, the company authorities absolutely agree and are willing to "donate" the two statues unconditionally. In short, the MGM company's attitude is no different to the relocation of the stone Weng Zhong statues, but I hope that the company authorities will not be troubled by this.

### Eleven Substandard Milk Farms Punished

[Report from this Newspaper] According to statistics from the Health Bureau, there are more than 60 milk farms in the city, with more than 3,000 dairy cows, producing about 40,000 pounds of fresh milk per day.

### Transfer of Renting Rights and Top Fees to Be Handled by the Court

Director Zhu immediately ordered staff to investigate. According to Yu and Wang, 550 million yuan was for decoration and painting, so it can be inferred that the remaining 70 million yuan must be the top fee. Director Zhu has often received tips regarding top fees for renting a house, but there has been no evidence. Now that Yu and Wang have admitted to receiving the top fee, according to Articles 6, 8, and 18 of the Housing Rental Regulations, a fine of up to three times the top fee should be imposed. The case was transferred to the court yesterday for handling.

He denied rape, saying that only two female students were manipulated by him. He admitted that it was just a moment of confusion. The court then continued to question the victims and witnesses.

Finally, it was ordered to change the date for another closed-door hearing, and the defendant was returned to custody.

### City Government Reiterates Attitude Towards Jiaotong University

[Report from this Newspaper] Regarding the Jiao Tong University Student Union's inquiries that have not yet been answered and the plan to convene a public arbitration meeting on its own, the city government specifically stated its attitude yesterday, saying: Jiao Tong University has not yet answered Mayor Wu's eight inquiries, which is tantamount to tacitly acknowledging that a small number of professional students are manipulating the situation. Before Jiao Tong University publicly answers, any activities of the school's Student Union are still likely to be manipulated by a small number of professional students. If the specific facts can be answered to Mayor Wu, there is no need for summons or arbitration. Moreover, the arbitration comes from Jiao Tong University, and the mayor will not pay attention to it or bury it. If the extended deadline expires, a public summons will be made in accordance with the law.

### The Municipal Council Receives Two Urgent Motions: Abolishing the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Policy to Earn Foreign Exchange; Requesting the Central Government to Negotiate the Cessation of Hong Kong Exchange Transactions

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Council yesterday received two temporary urgent motions, which will be submitted to the plenary session for discussion.

One was a proposal by Rong Hongyuan, Ma Junshuo, Liu Jingji, Zhu Fuqiu, Wang Wei, and others, with the joint signature of Xu Jilao and 31 others, requesting the government to abolish the cotton yarn and cloth control policy and open up yarn and cloth exports in order to earn foreign exchange and purchase raw cotton equipment to maintain production. The main points of the proposal's rationale stated: At the beginning of the establishment of the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee, the main purpose was to purchase and sell cotton and yarn on behalf of textile mills. However, in reality, only the unified purchase of cotton was implemented first, causing the factories to be unable to purchase on their own, resulting in a daily depletion of cotton reserves, and recently causing a disconnection phenomenon where the selling price of finished products is far lower than the cost. Although the authorities are now granting purchase certificates to the factories, the opportunity has been lost and the remedy is too late. In the future, the suspension of work is worrying. Therefore, it is difficult to save the crisis unless the government is requested to re-establish the entire production plan. The only way to remedy the cotton shortage is to open up yarn and cloth exports, earn foreign exchange, and exchange it for foreign cotton and production equipment so as to circulate and continue production. Method: It is proposed that the conference approve and forward it to the relevant departments of the central government for prompt adoption in order to save the textile industry crisis, consolidate the foundation of the country, and maintain the livelihood of the people. The second motion was a telegram from Wang Naixu requesting the central government to promptly negotiate with the Hong Kong government through diplomatic channels to stop Hong Kong exchange transactions, and to request that it deny that Hong Kong dollars outside the territory have the same value as those within the territory, so as to alleviate my country's economic crisis.

### Rice Prices Soar: White粳 Rice Reaches a High Price of 16 Million Yuan

[Our Newspaper's Report] Rice prices soared yesterday amid the rising prices of all commodities, like a wild horse off the reins, beyond control. The Civil Mediation Association's throwing of 6,000 stones of rice every other day is like a drop in the bucket and does not help. The food authorities will consider other methods because throwing rice has lost its effectiveness.

Yesterday, in the north and south rice markets, rumors were rampant. Large households held goods and refused to sell. The price of grain in the Wuxi producing area reported a rise.

### Floating Capital Pours into the Market: Most of the Chinese Stocks Hit the Daily Limit; Government Bonds Tend to Rise; Foreign Stocks Are Enthusiastically Bought

Chinese stocks yesterday were abnormally stimulated by outside the circle, and there was a tendency to have no goods to grab. Floating capital retreated and sought second best. Yong yarn finally hit the daily limit, and there was even a premium. All remaining stocks except Datong hit the daily limit.

When the market opened in the morning, people's hearts were unusually excited. Yong yarn appeared on the market at a price of 4,520 yuan and was sold to 4,500 yuan and 4,620 yuan one after another. The stimulation from outside the industry was strong, but the handling fee was opened high at 55 yuan and 60 yuan, and it had to be borne for two days. Although it rose, it mostly returned. After several seesaws, it finally rose to a new peak of 4,740 yuan due to the sharp rise in the spot price and the reduction of Hong Kong telegrams to one and a half cents. The cloth market was crazy and was suspended from trading. After the yarn and cloth rose, there was a return, and it fell to 4,630 yuan. However, Wuhe Hengfeng stood firm and hit the limit, and people's hearts were still excited. Guangbang and others were still paying. The noon closed at 4,700 yuan. Except for Wuhe hitting the limit, matches and Hengfeng hitting the limit and then returning, and Guohuo rising slightly, the rest rose by half a percent to one percent.

In the later market, the stimulation from outside the industry intensified, and it rose step by step. Until the time of closing, all stocks except Datong hit the daily limit. Yong yarn's dark market even added 70 to 80 yuan. Compared with the morning closing, except for Datong, which rose by 10%, the rest all hit the daily limit. Unlisted stocks outside the market all rose by about half a percent.

Government bonds also tended to rise yesterday. Tong Bing rose from 570,000 in the morning to 635,000 after rising from a low price of 550,000, and then returned slightly. Compared with the previous closing, A and B rose by 40,000 yuan, C rose by 100,000 yuan, D rose by 30,000 yuan, and E also traded well at 50,000 yuan, with a transaction volume of about 3 million.

Foreign stocks yesterday saw a surge in financial materials, and there was an image of no goods available. Floating capital came in a hurry. Foreign firms, securities firms, and Guangdong firms all entered the market. Yisha rose from 10 million in the morning to a peak of 12 million yuan, and then leveled off slightly. Compared with the previous closing, all popular stocks rose by 30% to 40% in unison.

### Cotton Yarn Warehouse Receipts: The Deadline for Prompt Delivery; Otherwise, Report to the Government for Price Acquisition

In recent times, cotton yarn has soared, and the market is full of speculation. Today (25th), after the opening of each yarn, it continued to rise sharply without limit. In view of this, the Yarn Control Committee has now set the following three measures:

(1) Recently, it has been found that more than 30 yarn merchants colluded with intermediaries to profit from 21-count double-horse in the market, speculating and manipulating, and raising yarn prices. The government authorities are thoroughly investigating and severely punishing them. In the future, when supervisory personnel inquire about the store numbers, addresses, and names of the persons in charge of both the buying and selling parties, the intermediaries should explain them at the time and must not be vague, otherwise they will be severely punished for speculating and raising prices.

(2) The transaction warehouse receipts submitted by the intermediaries as usual must not be missing. The addresses of both the buying and selling parties must be added and stamped by the pure guild. If there is any violation of the report, in addition to canceling the intermediary's qualifications, it will also be dealt with according to law.

(3) Recently, it has been found that the warehouse receipts of each yarn factory have been circulating in the market for a long time, which has fueled speculation. All are limited to prompt delivery, otherwise they will be reported to the government for price acquisition, or punished in accordance with the methods for cracking down on hoarding daily necessities during extraordinary times.

### More Than 100 Billion in Differences Between Banks and Bureaus: Silver Still Appears Stable

The big exchange exited 22.97 billion, the small exchange exited 146 billion, and foreign banks entered 56.9 billion.

### Silk Soars

The artificial silk market was even more crazy yesterday. 120-count Jin Sanma Guang, the opening price in the morning was as high as 950 million yuan, and then rose to 1.005 billion yuan. It once fell by 100 million yuan, and the noon closing rose to 1 billion yuan again. In the afternoon, it continued to rise. The opening price was 120 million yuan higher than the morning closing price, and the closing price was even higher at 1.2 billion yuan.

The rise in factory silk yesterday was not as great as that of artificial silk, because the China Trust Bureau allocated a total of 300 dan to silk weaving factories in this city and other cities, with a price of 952 million yuan, calculated at a 95% discount, with the payment due on the 7th of next month, so the market situation was slightly weak at the end. In the morning, there was a transaction of 1005 million yuan for high zero dan. In the afternoon, the opening price was 1.15 billion yuan. The final asking price was 1.2 billion yuan. The highest price for D-grade was 1.3 billion yuan.

Silk fabrics soared yesterday. Huaqiang Zhensi quilts closed at 480 million yuan in the morning. The price of a checkerboard crepe warehouse receipt was 1.8 million yuan. The afternoon was even more crazy. The quilts actually hit 600 million yuan. The checkerboard crepe warehouse receipt was outside the 2 million yuan mark. For the rest of the goods, the factory inventory in the afternoon was mostly not opened.

### The Tea Market Is Initially Stable and Then Rises

The tea market yesterday continued to show a situation of initial stability and then rising. A part of the industry felt that the bottom of June was approaching, and they were forced to worry about their positions, and the situation lacked change. And in the midst of the unprecedented surge in all commodities, they were forced to feel prosperous, and the main force suddenly rose to lift the price. The closing price repeatedly reached new highs. As for transactions, except for export tea, which was still inquired about by exporters, other domestic sales of various patterns were also inquired about by the local and rural merchants, and the process was active.

### Buyers Do Not Hesitate to Pay High Prices to Enter: The Yarn Market Rises Sharply and Cloth Prices Soar; The Cotton Cloth Market Suspends Trading in the Later Market

In the cotton yarn market yesterday, people were unanimously optimistic, and they bought as soon as they saw goods. Large households led the way, and scattered households followed. The market was full of buying voices, and the supply households were lacking. The market atmosphere was boiling, and the shouting prices were chaotic.

42-count Lanfeng fine yarn soared by more than 150 million yuan at the opening. Since then, the market has risen step by step as buyers do not hesitate to pay high prices and enter indiscriminately. The highest price once hit the 900 million mark. Later, due to the announcement by the Yarn Control Committee to crack down on speculative trading of warehouse receipts, people's hearts turned false, and the general floating profits were sold. The market finally ended at 870 million yuan, which was an increase of 205 million yuan compared with the previous day. The prices of other groups of fine yarn also soared significantly.

In the cotton cloth market yesterday, buyers flocked in, the market atmosphere was crazy, and the market price soared. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth soared by 3.7 million yuan at the beginning. Since then, new buyers have been active, and the absorption of the same industry has also been healthy. The buying atmosphere in the market has become more intense. In an instant, it broke through the 20 million mark and rose to 20.57 million, with many transactions. Until about 10:30, the authorities and the Hua Control Committee announced in the market that the trading of Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi Yuan Bijin would be suspended to wait for China Textile to open for sale and the supply to return to normal before trading again. As a result, trading was suspended in the later market. It was found that the market price of each cloth had soared by 20% to 30% compared with the previous day.

The Ministry of Education is assisting them in employment and has ordered each school to order each school to return to their original hometowns for service, except for a small number of special circumstances where the school may introduce them nearby or negotiate their own service places, and has ordered the education halls and bureaus of each province and city to plan properly.

### Sixty of Our International Students Receive Funding from the British Council

[Central News Agency, London, 24th] According to the British Council, there are currently 60 Chinese students studying in the UK on scholarships from the Council. Among them are 6 professors who have gone to the UK to give lectures and 7 students from Hong Kong. Most of the international students have been approved for a second year of scholarships. Some have graduated and returned to their country. Four of them have transferred to the United States for further studies. All four are studying medicine.

### Self-funded Students Studying in the United States Oppose the New Exchange Settlement Method

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the government stipulated that international students would change to exchange settlement at the listed price, the second batch of self-funded international students in the United States were panicked. They believed that if exchange settlement was made at the listed price, 900 US dollars would require as much as 450 million legal currency, which students could not afford. Zhao Yi, chairman of the National Second Self-funded Students Association, urgently telegraphed the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Education, requesting to maintain the official price in order to complete their studies, and went to Washington to petition Ambassador Gu. Dr. Ruthven, President of the University of Michigan, and Dr. Gale, Supervisor of International Students, expressed their sympathy for the students' situation and also telegraphed our country's Finance Minister Wang Yunwu, expressing the same. More than 60 self-funded students from the school have established a student association and elected Zhu Zhitai and Jiang Luyu as the persons in charge to actively contact students from other schools to plan for progress. The reasons held by the self-funded students: (1) The Ministry of Education's examination and recruitment of the second batch of self-funded international students at an exchange rate of 12,000 yuan was officially replied to the Legislative Yuan by the Executive Yuan, and there is a record to be based on. (2) When the self-funded students went abroad, the foreign affairs authorities negotiated with the US side to guarantee that there would be no foreign exchange problems for the self-funded students. The US consulate only allowed visas of 900 yuan. This change in foreign exchange not only increased the burden on the students, but also caused the foreign affairs authorities to lose credibility with the US side. (3) The newly set price is 40 times higher than the official price, and self-funded students are really unable to raise the huge amount of 450 million yuan. (4) The government re-declares that the study period is two years. Self-funded students go abroad at different times, some with three exchange settlements and some with one exchange settlement. Making sudden changes is unfair.

### "National Guanghua University" Flag Raised on the Roof of Guanghua Yesterday

The school has announced that the final deadline for the exam is next Monday.

Yesterday morning, more than a thousand students living on campus marched on campus and held evening parties every day. The campus is full of slogans, and the atmosphere is quite enthusiastic.

Literature and History

### A Single Flower

— Zhang Zhenglang

Tang Yuan Zhen Yuan's Changqing Collection, Volume 10, A Response to Hanlin Bai Xueshi's Letter:

All the names are written in ink, the time is spent listening to stories. There is a note below that says:

Letian often travels with me, and always writes his name on the walls of houses. Also, when at the Xin Chang residence, he told a "Single Flower" story, and from Yin to Si, the words were not finished. (According to the Ming Jiajing Dongwu Shi engraved edition of Yuan's Changqing Collection and the Wan Chan Songjiang Ma Shi engraved edition, this industry is missing, and this note is incomplete. Qian Qianyi, Lu Wenshao, and Zhang Yuanji in modern times have all proofread and supplemented it according to the Song edition, so the currently seen Complete Tang Poems and Sibu Jikan have been supplemented without missing anything.)

According to Xu Song's Tang Two Capitals City Ward Examination (Volume 3), Xin Changli is located on the north side of the road inside the Yanxing Gate in Chang'an. Bai Juyi lived in Xin Changli when he was the Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and knew the edicts. This poem by Wei Zhi recalls old travels and cherishes the past. It should be between the years after Wei Zhi was awarded the position of Proofreader with the fourth grade in the Zhongshu province in the eighteenth year of Emperor Dezong's Zhenyuan reign (802) and before he was appointed as Left Advisor in the first year of Emperor Xianzong's Yuanhe reign (806) due to his talent, knowledge, and understanding of the principles of practical application, a period of three or four years. ("Shuohua" is one of the skills of the Song Dynasty's Washa, and its origin can be traced back to Hou Bai of the Sui Dynasty, which I have discussed separately. The "Single Flower" mentioned here should be the earliest of the novels and stories known today.)

"Single Flower" is the story of the "Lady of Wei State," the earliest version of which can be found in the "Taiping Guangji" (Volume 484), titled "The Story of Li Wa," with a note at the end of the chapter stating "From the Collection of Strange Tales." According to the "Collection of Strange Tales," it was compiled by Chen Han, a Director of the Department of Agriculture in the late Tang Dynasty, as seen in the "New Tang Book, Art and Literature Records, Fiction Category." The book was recorded in the "Chao Gongwu Junzhai Reading Records" and "Chen Zhensun Zhizhai Book Record Explanation" of the Song Dynasty, but was later lost. The Ming manuscript of the "Hui Zao Lei Shuo," Volume 26, collected by the Institute of History and Philology of the National Academia Sinica, has the "Collection of Strange Tales," which has been abridged and is incomplete. It is preceded by a title stating "Chen Han, Director of the Department of Agriculture, Compiled." It matches the Tang Records and Book Record Explanation, and is still the original book style. The excerpt of the "Story of the Lady of Wei State" is too brief, less than one-tenth of what is recorded in the "Taiping Guangji," and there is a sentence that says:

Formerly named "Single Flower." Yuan Zhen's Response to Bai Juyi's Letter states that all the names are written in ink, and the time is spent listening to stories. The note says that Letian often traveled with him and often wrote his name on the Guipi (wall), and then told a "Single Flower" story, from Yin to Si. (Note: This text is missing the word "Han," and the notes are mistranslated as "Zhu," and "Bi" is mistranslated as "Gui." Also, the words "Fu Ben" should also be mistranslated, and I dare not speculate.)

This text should be the original note of Chen Han's "Collection of Strange Tales." When Zeng Zao abridged the main text of the "Story of the Lady of Wei State," he also abridged the notes of Chen, so the text is difficult to understand and not very coherent. There is a side proof that this note comes from the "Collection of Strange Tales." According to the end of the "The Story of Xie Xiao'e" in the same book, there is also a note that says:

The strange stories recorded are slightly different, so both are preserved.

Although the "Story of Xie Xiao'e" has been abridged here, it can be determined that the original text was written by Li Gongzuo by comparing it with Li Gongzuo's "The Story of Xie Xiao'e" in the "Taiping Guangji" (Volume 491). The "Monk Miaoji" article in Li Fuyan's "Continuation of Strange Tales Records" (Song edition reprinted in the Sibu Congkan Continued Compilation) also describes the story of Xiao'e with slight differences. Chen Han "therefore preserved both." The current edition of the "Collection of Strange Tales" only preserves Li Gongzuo's text, and does not preserve a single word of what is recorded in the "Continuation of Strange Tales Records." It is known that these notes all came from Chen Han and not from Zeng Zao. The "Taiping Guangji" version of "The Story of Li Wa" begins by saying:

Li Wa, the Lady of Wei State, was a prostitute in Chang'an. Her integrity and behavior were remarkable, and she was praised in Chang'an. Therefore, Bai Xingjian, the Supervising Censor, wrote a biography for her.

These thirty-one characters are not Bai Xingjian's original text, because the year of writing is clearly stated at the end of the biography as the autumn of the eleventh year of Zhenyuan (795). At that time, Xingjian had not yet passed the imperial examination (refer to the original biography in the Old Tang Book). How could he call himself a Supervising Censor? Therefore, it is suspected that this is also Chen Han's text in the "Collection of Strange Tales." The editors of the "Taiping Guangji" did not completely remove it and inadvertently inserted it at the beginning of the main text.

Chen Han was a person of the late Tang Dynasty and not far from the Yuan and Bai era. It is said that the old name of "The Story of the Lady of Wei State" was "Single Flower," which should have been based on something. Bai Xingjian wrote the biography in the eleventh year of Zhenyuan (795), and Yuan and Bai listened to the story of "Single Flower" at the Xin Chang residence seven or eight years later. The biography has more than 3,500 words. The storytellers talked from Yin (3-5 am) to Si (9-11 am) without finishing the story. It can be seen that the technology of storytellers at that time had greatly improved, covering the story with more words beyond the biography. Song Dynasty storytellers often used short stories by others as storytelling materials. From this point of view, it can be known that this trend already existed when Tang people wrote novels.

Zeng Lei Shuo was completed in the sixth year of Shaoxing (1136) and published in Gengshen (1140). It was reprinted in Baoqing Bingxu (1226). "The Ming people deleted many things from the printed edition" (see Tieqin Tongjianlou Book Catalogue, Volume 16). These editions are not available. The Wenjin Pavilion Siku Quanshu edition, Volume 28, has been changed, which is different from the Ming manuscript collected by the Academia Sinica. The "Collection of Strange Tales" is in Volume 28, and Chen Han's title is no longer preserved. The note after "The Story of the Lady of Wei State" only has twelve characters:

Formerly named Single Flower Ben Said Single Flower From Yan

The meaning of the text becomes more incomprehensible. It is suspected that it was not deleted by the Siku Quanshu officials, but the origin of the text is unknown.

"Single Flower" was initially the name of a storytelling script, and gradually became Li Wa's alias. In Luo Ye's newly compiled "Drunk Old Man's Talks," Gui Collection, Volume 1, "Not Breaking Faith," there is an article titled "Li Ya does not betray Zheng Yuanhe." The opening sentences are:

Li Wa was a prostitute in Chang'an, with the alias Ya Xian, formerly named "Single Flower." There was a student named Zheng, with the alias Yuanhe, from Jiangyang, who was taking the imperial examination in Chang'an.

Luo Ye's "Drunk Old Man's Talks" is the only copy collected by the Date Clan's Kanran Pavilion in Japan. It was reprinted and published by Bunkyudo in Tokyo in Showa 15, and Chinese and Japanese scholars have mostly determined it to be a Song engraving. In my opinion, it may be a Yuan engraving and Ming printed edition, but there is no problem that the book was completed at the end of the Song Dynasty. These five words "formerly named Single Flower" obviously come from Chen Han's "Collection of Strange Tales." It is suspected that it was a small note under the title, which was inserted into the first line of the main text during copying or engraving, so it is not very coherent with the context. This situation is exactly similar to the addition of thirty-one characters at the beginning of the "Taiping Guangji" version of "The Story of Li Wa." (Recently, a friend proofread Ma Huan's "Yingyai Shenglan," and the small notes under the titles of each country are also often mixed into the first line of the main text, which is the same example). From then on, it was said that Li Wa's alias was "Single Flower." In the Ming Dynasty, Zhou Xianwang's "Li Yaxian's Flower Wine Qujiang Pond" (Dong's Songfen Studio reprinted Miscellaneous Drama Ten Brocade Book):

Bo Yin is introducing, and Mei Xiang goes up and says: This old woman is Li Mama from Mingke Lane in Chang'an City. She has a biological daughter named Yaxian. The officials in the city saw that she was beautiful and gave her the name "Single Flower."

This statement about why Li Wa is called "Single Flower" cannot be found in the books of people before the Ming Dynasty. It should be Zhou Xianwang's guess, so Shi Junbao's "Li Yaxian's Flower Wine Qujiang Pond" (Yuan Opera Selection B Collection) and Xue Jingun's "Embroidered Yun Record" (Sheyuan Tao's reprinted edition) in the Ming Dynasty do not have this statement.

The story of Li Wa is sad and moving, and "the music ends with elegance," which is in line with the ethical concepts of the Chinese people, and is the biggest reason for its popularity. Among the Tang Dynasty novels that had a great impact on later dramas and novels, in addition to Yuan Zhen's "Yingying Biography," this article should be the most important. Apart from what Jin Shengtan called "Continuation of the Western Chamber," the story of Yingying has not changed much. The story of Li Wa has many anecdotes in the Song Dynasty. Yuan Sui has the "Li Wa Travel," and Xu Yanzhou's Poetry Talks once quoted the two sentences "The hairpin is high and majestic by a foot, standing in front of the door to watch the spring breeze," but the full text is no longer available. I once saw in the Yongle Encyclopedia, the "Lang" rhyme, there is an entry for "Lost Strategy Lang," quoting Zhang Junfang's "Li Qing Collection" about Zheng Sheng and Li Wa's affairs. Unfortunately, there are only a few words, and the details are not available. I remember that someone in the Northern Song Dynasty's notes had already mentioned "Zheng Yuanhe," but I cannot remember the name of the book in a hurry. Therefore, the evolution of this story will not be discussed for the time being. In the Ming Dynasty, Chao Huan's (a person from the Jiajing period) "Bao Wen Tang Classified Book Catalogue, Miscellaneous Category," there is "The Record of Li Yaxian," mixed with word talks and novels, which should be the abbreviation of "Zheng Yuanhe's Prostitution Encounter with Li Yaxian" in the seventh volume of Yu Gongren's (a person from the Chongzhen period) published "Dang Ju Notes." This record is in the popular novel style, stating that Zheng Sheng's name is Ping, alias Yuanhe, and his father's name is Xian, alias Jucai. The record can broaden knowledge. The ending says:

Although it is a new story from the brothel, it is compiled into a valley where the secluded produces spring.

It is also appended with a seven-line quatrain and a seven-line律詩, which is purely in the tone of "storytelling," but it is vulgar and unbearable. The events are full of errors, and the interest is extremely low. It seems that it has been popular among storytellers for a long time, so it has gradually lost its authenticity. Therefore, it is suspected that "telling the story of a single flower" has gradually changed in quality from the Tang Dynasty to the Ming Dynasty, but it has not been lost. It is recorded here for the wise to judge. (37.6.12)

### Zou Hanxun "On the Five Averages" Clarification of Doubts

— Zhou Zumo

As in Zonghuan's Record of Siddham Forest, sounds of the Middle Heaven (seen in Japanese An'nen's Siddham Collection), this type is referred to as throat sounds; while in Zhiguang's Record of Siddham Characters, sounds of the Southern Heaven (seen in this book), they are referred to as dental sounds. The five-sound method in the final section of Guangyun is a blend of these two schools, hence the existence of both throat sounds and dental sounds. As for using the "he" character of the Xia mother as a throat sound, and the "xing" character of the Xia mother as a dental sound, this is because the eighth sound h in Siddham supersounds is a fricative in the throat, similar to the Xiao and Xia mothers. Panini once said this was of the same category as k, so scholars of Sanskrit transmission equated it with Jian and Xi. In terms of phonetics, the Sanskrit k, k, called jihvamuliya by Patatigakhyas, is a tongue-root sound, not a sound from the throat (Kantha) as Panini believed. The Sanskrit h is a throat sound, but Panini incorrectly grouped it with k (see Whithey's Sanskrit Grammar). In Chinese, Jian and Xi are equivalent to Sanskrit k, k, while Xiao and Li resemble Sanskrit h. Thus, the Tang people's alphabet considered Jian and Xi as dental sounds, and Xiao and Li as throat sounds (see Dunhuang Duosuo 100). Today, books discussing Siddham, such as the Siddham Chapter of the Nirvana Sutra, Record of Siddham Characters, and Jingyou Tianzhu Ziyuan, all name the five sounds as dental, lingual, labial, guttural, and labial. Therefore, the existence of both dental and guttural names for the five sounds has a basis, named according to the Siddham art, although the examples given may not fully correspond to Siddham. Mr. Zou, misunderstanding the meaning of dental sounds and the reason for the combination of dental and guttural sounds, makes purely speculative statements that must be refuted.

In essence, although Mr. Zou's book is lengthy in argument, it lacks substantial insight and cannot compare to the works of Jiang and Chen. Because it may mislead the future, I openly criticize it, not daring to denigrate previous scholars." (To be continued)

### Jottings with a Writing Brush

— Tang Lan

The Tiger Tally of New Xi in Xinqi, formerly in the collection of the Luo family in Shangyu, is inlaid with gold characters in four lines, the text being:

The tally of armor and weapons, the right half with the King, the left half with the New Xi Commandant. Whenever dealing with soldiers, deploying armored troops, fifty men or more, the King's tally must be matched before action. In case of emergency, action can be taken even without matching the tally. The characters are in small seal script, very exquisite.

Mr. Wang Jingan once wrote a postscript to the Qin New Xi Tiger Tally, citing Wei Zhao's persuasion of King Wei by Su Qin: "Your Majesty's country has Xu, Yan, Kunyang, Wuyang, and New Xi in the south." It is said that New Xi was still Wei territory during the reign of King Wei'an, because New Xi was east of Wuyang, separated by the Chu state's Chen city. At that time, the Chu capital was in Chen, and it wasn't until the 54th year of King Zhao of Qin that the Chu capital moved to Juyang, and the fifth year of the First Emperor that it moved to Shouchun, that New Xi had the possibility of entering Qin. Therefore, he determined:

This tally must be from the twenty or thirty years before Qin unified the world.

Mr. Wang's research is generally correct. However, I feel that New Xi entering Qin was even later, and it was no longer part of Wei at that time. Because the Records of Qin Shi Huang states:

In the seventeenth year, Neishi Teng attacked Han, captured King An of Han, and annexed all its territory, establishing a commandery named Yingchuan.

The Table of the Six States states under the seventeenth year of the First Emperor:

Neishi Sheng attacked and captured King An of Han, seizing all his territory and establishing the Yingchuan Commandery. New Xi belongs to the Runan Commandery in the Geography of the Han Shu. Runan Commandery was newly established by Emperor Gaozu of Han and originally belonged to the Yingchuan and Nanyang Commanderies of the Qin Dynasty. The large authority of New Xi was divided from Yingchuan. Furthermore, the "Xu," "Yan" (recorded as "Yanqing" in the Geography), "Kunyang," and "Wuyang" four counties mentioned in the Wei Strategy, are all located in the Yingchuan Commandery, which serves as clear evidence. Therefore, these places were obtained by Qin from Han and were no longer the land of Wei.

The establishment of Yingchuan Commandery in the 17th year of the First Emperor was 230 BC. Nine years later, he unified the world and became emperor (the 26th year of the First Emperor, 221 BC). However, here it is still referred to as "King," indicating that it was before he claimed the title of emperor (the Yangling Tiger Tally states "the right half is with the Emperor"), which means it could only have been made within these nine years. Therefore, I suspect it was made at the time of the establishment of Yingchuan Commandery. Therefore, we can say more precisely that this tiger tally was made after the 17th year of the First Emperor, with a difference of no more than a year or two at the latest.

At that time, Li Si had already been in power for a long time, and he was the originator of the small seal script, so it is no wonder that the seal script on this tally is so exquisite.

### Reading Ma Yuancai's Outline of Qin History

— Ji Xianlin

I myself have no comprehensive understanding of Qin history. Hearing that Mr. Ma is an expert in the study of Qin history, I borrowed his great work, Outline of Qin History, from the library, preparing to read it carefully. However, before I even reached the main text, only reaching the second page of his preface, I saw the following words:

"Moreover, I have been moved by it! The way of reading history is truly difficult to express. My study of Qin history is based primarily on the Records of the Grand Historian. The Records of the Grand Historian is a book that I learned from a young age. Counting from the year I started studying Qin history until now, it has been twelve years. I have delved into the Records of the Grand Historian no less than a hundred million times. However, after more than ten years, in the autumn of the thirtieth year, I realized that the "budebu ci" (forbidden from sacrificing) of "budebu" was "futu" (Buddha). After another two years, in the spring of this year (the 33rd year of the Republic of China—Xianlin note), I realized that "Xianmen" was "Shamen" (monk), and "Anqi" was "Aqiini." (All are seen in the second volume of this book and my humble work, A Study of the Popularization of Buddhism in China during the Qin Dynasty—author's original note)."

Without needing to read the entire book, just these few short sentences, I feel, require discussion.

The second volume of Mr. Ma's Outline of Qin History and A Study of the Popularization of Buddhism in China during the Qin Dynasty do not seem to have been published yet, at least I have not seen them. I don't know what the content is; but just looking at the passage in the preface above, one can see that he only discovered that the "budebu" of "budebu ci" is the later "futu" (Buddha) in the autumn of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), and from the tone, it seems to be his own original creation, not copied from others. This greatly surprised me. As early as 1927, the Japanese scholar Fujita Toyohachi wrote a paper (Toyo Gakuho, Volume 16, Number 2), arguing that "budebu" was a transliteration of the Sanskrit word Buddha. The response of Chinese and foreign scholars to this article was almost unanimous; they all believed that this theory was untenable. The "budebu" in the original sentence "jin budebu mingxing chu xifang" (forbidden from sacrificing, the stars will not come from the West) is a function word, not a content word. Mr. Tang Xiyu (Yongtong) also discussed this issue in the seventh and eighth chapters of his History of Buddhism in the Han, Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties. He also believed that this statement was groundless. However, Mr. Ma, fourteen years after the publication of Fujita's paper, ten years after he started studying Qin history, suddenly discovered that "budebu" was "futu." In his great work, A Study of the Popularization of Buddhism in China during the Qin Dynasty, this may be the main argument. What else can we say besides being surprised?

Of course, we cannot expect a scholar to read all the books in the world; this is simply impossible. But he should generally be aware of the books and papers within his research scope. Especially since Fujita's paper has been discussed by many scholars, it seems that a scholar who claims to study Qin history should not be unaware of it. Even if we take a step back and say that if a scholar wants to write a paper proving that Buddhism had already entered China during the Qin Dynasty, he should definitely take a look at Tang's History of Buddhism in the Han, Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties. But Mr. Ma is completely unaware of all this. Besides being surprised, we really have nothing else to say.

Let us now discuss the two borrowed foreign words that Mr. Ma discovered twelve years after "starting to study Qin history": "Xianmen" is "Shamen" (monk), and "Anqi" is "Aqiini." We can only see from the records in the Records of the Grand Historian that "Xianmen" is an immortal living in a misty and ethereal place. However, Mr. Ma said that this is an Indian monk. According to the Sanskrit original of "Shamen" is Sramana, and the Pali word Samana. Tang Huilin's Yiqiejing Yin Yi, Volume 18, says: "Shamen, is a corrupted Sanskrit word. The correct Sanskrit pronunciation is Shiramana." (Taisho Tripitaka, Volume 54, page 420, upper) According to our current research, "Shamen" is not "corrupted" because it was not directly translated from Sanskrit, but went through a medium. In Tocharian A (Agnian language), Sanskrit Sramana becomes Samam, and in Tocharian B (Kuchean language) it becomes Samane. The Chinese "Shamen" was translated from Tocharian. Since Mr. Ma argues that "Xianmen" is "Shamen," does he know that the source of "Shamen" has undergone so many twists and turns? Is he able to prove that "Xianmen" was also translated into Chinese through the medium of Tocharian? At the very least, he should be able to prove that "Xianmen" was translated from ancient Indian vernacular (Prakrit), because Sanskrit Sramana would never be translated as "Xianmen." I am afraid Mr. Ma cannot do any of these things. However, he himself believes that this is no longer a problem. In his Qin history, he has already established an independent biography for "Xianmen."

As for "Agni", the original Sanskrit word is Agni, which is the god of fire and was highly revered in ancient India. There are many songs in the Rigveda that praise the god of fire. The Chinese translation "Ajiini" is equivalent to the Sanskrit pronunciation; but "Anqi" has a problem. According to Bernhard Karlgren's reconstruction, the pronunciation of the character (An) is:

an/an/an (Grammata Serica, 146)

The pronunciation of the character (Qi) is:

kjag/kji/ki (Grammata Serica 952)

Can Mr. Ma prove why the Sanskrit Agni changed its pronunciation when it came to China? In addition to the difficulties in pronunciation, we also do not understand why the Indian god of fire ran to China and became an immortal. We also hope that Mr. Ma can explain it to us.

My criticism of Mr. Ma's words in the preface to his great work ends here. Some may think that I am making a mountain out of a molehill. Mr. Ma Guangsheng only wrote a few words, but I have written a long article. However, I feel that Mr. Ma's few words represent a very popular, very fashionable, and very absurd trend in the current Chinese academic world, and we should stand up and correct it. There are many so-called scholars who have no comprehensive understanding of ancient Central Asian languages, but they prefer to talk about transliteration. They don't even have the most basic common sense, they don't even know the simplest methods, all they have is a pitiful bit of fantasy, and they use this fantasy to study problems. As long as they are happy, they can put any Chinese character together with any foreign character and say that this Chinese character is a transliteration of this foreign character. They are like children playing with building blocks, able to separate the letters of foreign words one by one, and then rearrange them one by one. The order is not important to them at all. This approach really makes us laugh and cry. We can simply say that this is an academic evil. Recently, many scholars have written such articles. Before reading these articles, I did not believe that there could be such absurd things in the world. After reading them, I realized that I was still a frog in a well. An old scholar in Nanjing is particularly diligent in this regard and has written many such articles. The most wonderful thing is that he also has an article saying that "budebu" is "futu", published in "Truth" (this was told to me by Mr. Zhang Yuanfeng), which can be said to be a rare coincidence.

I have written a long article, not out of disrespect for Mr. Ma, but simply using the topic to expand on the discussion, hoping that scholars will be particularly careful when studying transliteration. Mr. Ma's book may still have valuable aspects. I am an amateur and will only discuss that section of his preface here, and will not discuss the rest.

### Idol Worship

— Qian Wen

The Three Treasures of Buddhism are the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. If we were to test the public with a quiz, putting in these three terms, I am afraid that not many would be able to give the correct answers. What is Buddha? The common people only say it is Buddha and Bodhisattva. What is Bodhisattva? They will answer that Bodhisattvas are gods. What is Sangha for? Most people probably think they are for chanting scriptures and performing rites for the dead. What is Dharma? Very few people would be able to answer.

Christianity forbids idol worship because a monotheistic religion certainly does not allow the worship of bull-demons, snake-gods, and those kinds of images. Even their Jehovah cannot be represented by any kind of image. As for the image of the Virgin Mary and the image of Jesus on the cross, they are all memorials and artistic creations. Buddhism uses images for teaching. Although there are quite a few Buddha images, Bodhisattva images, and Arhat images, whether they are clay sculptures, wood carvings, stone carvings, or written paintings, they are all the remaining images of the sages of the Indian school. Although they may not be real, believers have more or less added their own imaginations to create them. For example, Guanshiyin has gradually become feminine in our country. These images all show compassion and solemnity, but they are consistent. Those who truly understand the Dharma will never confuse "seeking gods" with "worshipping the Buddha."

There was once a high monk who used wooden Buddha images as firewood. When asked what he was doing, he said he wanted to burn out the relics. The questioner said, "How can there be relics in wood?" He said, "Since there are none, it is just a piece of wood. What harm is there in burning it?" Taking idols as gods, Buddha images as a kind of god that can fulfill any request, and stone statues of ancient people as Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, this proves that the level of national knowledge is low, which is shocking and painful.

Zhang Taiyan said, "Buddhist scriptures do not worship ghosts and gods. Their own sect is based on stillness, wisdom, and profound arguments, thinking deeply into the question of non-existence. Because it was located in India, it was mixed with strange and absurd talk, which high talents in China did not pay attention to." It is not necessary to discuss that a high talent does not believe in mythology, but it is a pity that after Buddhism entered China, few people knew about the profound arguments, but mythology was particularly popular, making ignorant men and women have no other faith except in gods and monsters. This is an education problem, and smashing stone figures to fill the roads is not a fundamental solution. Freedom of belief, but how can we make the people believe what they should believe?

Some people say that Buddhism is declining today, but I think otherwise. What is declining is the custom of going to temples to burn incense, asking for sons and wealth. This shows that fewer people believe in gods and monsters, while high talents are organizing Buddhist societies and studying academic questions. However, high talents are good at thinking for other high talents, but they are unwilling to worry about the many people who are bowing down to idols on the road. Since someone is engaged in re-editing the Tripitaka, why has no one compiled a simple overview of Buddhism so that both opponents and believers can understand the true meaning of the Dharma? Emperor Wu of Liang asked Bodhidharma what merit he had for building temples, writing scriptures, and ordaining monks. Bodhidharma answered that there was no merit. Bodhidharma came to the East to warn the emperor and break his superstition. If Buddhists want to promote the Dharma and dispel the misunderstandings of fools about the Dharma, it is best to tear down the Wenchang Hall and the Hall of the God of Wealth in the ancient Longhua Temple; otherwise, people will think that these two idols who bless people with promotion and wealth are the Buddha and the Bodhisattva.

### The Smallest Bird

— Mao Yi

The hummingbird is the smallest of birds, weighing no more than one-tenth of an ounce. However, they have extremely high flying speeds, with their wings capable of flapping seventy-five times a second, and they can fly at fifty-five miles per hour. And they are able to fly back and forth a thousand miles! They are able to achieve this feat because they possess unusually strong wing muscles and great ambition.

The entire lifestyle of the hummingbird is fast-paced: quick courtship; quick mating; quick laying of eggs; even nest-building is fast, usually completed in a day. The size of the eggs is like a pea, and when the chicks hatch, they are barely larger than a human fingernail, which is quite amusing.

The hummingbird's tongue is a unique marvel of the "bird world," composed of two tubular organs. How they move the nectar they consume into these two organs is still not understood by humans. In addition to nectar, they also eat small insects that forage in the flowers and are caught in flight.

In terms of selecting flowers, hummingbirds are skilled botanists. They target flowers with trumpet-shaped corollas, as the nectar in these flowers is hidden deep within. Bees are simply unable to compete with hummingbirds in this regard; only a long-tongued butterfly can reach deep into these flowers, but the strong-willed hummingbirds can easily drive away their competitors.

There are many types of hummingbirds, and their names are beautiful, such as: sapphire hummingbird, rainbow hummingbird, fairy hummingbird, emerald hummingbird, etc. In total, there are more than six hundred and fifty species of hummingbirds. Robert Moore of Pasadena, California, has the most extensive collection of hummingbird specimens, with nearly six hundred species, all personally collected by him.

The feathers of the hummingbird are extremely beautiful, and their colors can change under the sun. However, this is not because the hummingbird's feathers have multiple pigments, but because their small barbules are able to refract light like diamonds. Hummingbirds have "prisms of feathers," they are living rainbows, and they use sunlight to adorn themselves with brilliance and preciousness.

### Lu Xun's Book Collection

— Nian Xin

The collection of books in the Sanxian Shuwu (Three Idlers Studio) is extremely broad in scope and is divided into two locations, Shanghai and Beiping. I have seen the Shanghai part. In addition to books of both Chinese and foreign origin, there are books in Western languages, among which Japanese books are the most numerous, followed by German. Although there are also collections of Russian and English books, they are mostly because the illustrations in the books are exquisite. Lu Xun was indeed very concerned about and loved Chinese and Western art. The "Han Paintings" in his Beiping collection are said to contain many treasures, but unfortunately, he did not have time to compile and organize them before his death. The "Sibu Beiyao" of the Commercial Press is also one of the "major books" in the Sanxian Shuwu. Lu Xun wanted to compile a complete "History of Chinese Literature" in his later years and purchased this book as a reference material, and it is said that he had already prepared a plan. Lu Xun also discussed this matter in letters with friends and lamented that he could not find a good and quiet environment in the country. Although Beiping was an ideal place, certain restrictions made Lu Xun feel "constrained." Therefore, throughout his life, this "History of Chinese Literature," which was anticipated by the literary world, was never completed. (Currently, the most detailed and comprehensive "History of Chinese Literature" in China seems to be the one by Zheng, published by the Beiping Pushe, but it only goes up to the Ming Dynasty and is now out of print.) And some of the volumes of "Sibu Beiyao" have not even been opened.

As for a detailed catalog of the books in the Sanxian Shuwu, Ms. Jing Song may have compiled it? However, it has not been published to the public, which is also of concern to book lovers. However, the Wenhui Daily had previously published Lu Xun's "Diary" daily, in which he would add a note whenever he obtained a book, and readers could see a glimpse of the Sanxian Shuwu's collection from this.

Here, I also recall that during the period of occupation, due to the high cost of living, Lu Xun's family in Beiping had a proposal to sell books. At that time, Ms. Jing Song published a statement in Shanghai opposing it. It is regrettable when the efforts of a literary man are transferred to another. Later, it is unknown whether this proposal was actually implemented, or whether it was abandoned due to the "opposition" from Shanghai. However, when I read Lu Xun's "Leisurely Talks After Illness" (Qiejieting Miscellany, page 220), which mentions Song Duanyi's "Lizhai Xianlu," it says: "I have been keeping this book, until more than ten years ago, because I was so hungry that I sold it and two other Ming manuscripts and a Ming print of 'Gongkai Bidian' to Fu, who is famous as a bibliophile and scholar. He made me run three or four times before saying that he would give me eight yuan in total. I refused to sell in a fit of anger, and took it back and hid it in my residence in Beiping; but no one has taken care of it for a long time, and I don't know what happened to it now." Thus, Lu Xun had also wanted to solve his "hunger" problem by selling books in his early years. The "Fu" mentioned here should be Fu Yuanshu (Zengxiang) from Jiangxiang, who is famous for the inscriptions on his Yizang'an library. However, this book was not originally purchased by Lu Xun himself, but was left by his ancestors. As he said in his article, "My family is not a book collecting family, I really don't understand how there would be this Ming manuscript," which shows its value. Therefore, I would also like to ask: "I don't know what happened to it now?"

### Raindrops

— Shi Jimi

No one denies that multicolored colors are beautiful, but the colors that have failed are even more unsightly than no color at all.

When you think too much about everything, everything is terrible; therefore, people who think too much are somewhat neurotic.

Dear, if everyone's nose was not as flat as the one you mock, what would be so outstanding about your well-defined and beautiful Greek nose?

Some people think that everything belonging to others is good, and others think that everything belonging to themselves is the best. — They are all equally confused and pitiful insects.

A doctor curses patients in his clinic. Has he forgotten that healthy people don't see doctors?

If you envy someone's basket of fish, quickly cast your own net to the bottom of the river.

There are so many mirrors in the world, why are there so many people who do not know what they really look like?

### Coercion

— Yi Jun

Sometimes, "coercion" is not the same as "oppression." Those who are "oppressed" only experience suffering, but those who are "coerced" may obtain happiness.

For example, when summer arrives and typhoid and cholera are prevalent, health authorities have a method of compulsory vaccinations. Regardless of whether you are willing to get vaccinated or afraid of the pain, they will give you at least one shot, or else they will make things difficult for you, such as not selling you a train ticket. But coercing you to get vaccinated is for your own happiness and the happiness of all citizens.

Another example: All countries have compulsory education systems. (Last night, as I was writing this, it was twelve o'clock, the main power switch was turned off, the dormitory lights went out, and I was forced to go to bed. I was a little resentful in my heart. But turning off the lights at midnight and forcing me to put down my pen and go to sleep certainly takes my health into consideration.) The duration of compulsory education is four years in China, ten years in England, four to nine years in the United States, and four years in the Soviet Union, and so on. No matter what your future aspirations are, you must first complete the required years of compulsory education. But coercing you to receive education is to give you spiritual sustenance and preserve and promote national culture.

This kind of "coercion" that is not "oppression," this "trouble" for the sake of obtaining "happiness," should be done thoroughly without fear. However, if the person in charge always puts on a stern face, "enforcing" things in a hostile manner, without explaining the reason clearly to people, and still believes that "the people can be made to follow, but not to understand," then it seems close to "oppression."

### 

The hustle and bustle of current events is now a spectacle, lacking nothing. At home and abroad, in the literary and military fields, everything is a thrilling show. Try reading every newspaper; the new and strange stories recorded each day are almost overwhelming. In addition to the international political maneuvering and the domestic power struggles, which are considered "important news," there are also many novelistic and interesting stories, such as "Pandas" and "Sister Yang," interspersed throughout, like reading the Classic of Mountains and Seas or opening Records of Gods and Marvels. If "Pu" of Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio and "Ji" of Yuewei Thatched Cottage Notes were alive today, they would surely greatly welcome the endless stream of such strange news. (Now, those in the "film industry" see Sister Yang and the like as something to capitalize on.)

"The people regard food as heaven," this is common knowledge. "Eating and clothing" is also a common saying. Those who are accustomed to wearing clothes may not need them, but they cannot do without food; thus, food is even more closely related to "life." Considering the soaring grain prices in recent years, which are inevitably followed by cries of "cannot survive," historically, even emperors like Duke Huan of Qi and Zhao Wu, despite their noble status, had to climb trees to search for birds for food when they were starving. This shows that regardless of wealth or poverty, high or low status, in China or abroad, in ancient or modern times, no hero can hold a grudge against their own stomach. Therefore, in the play "Selling the Horse," Qin Shubao, exhausted in the inn, suddenly hears the words "Go eat!" and immediately awakens with a startled expression. In the play "Pan Guan," the gatekeeper, standing sideways and nodding off, suddenly hears the words "Eat noodles!" and immediately exclaims "Good salty brine!" with a drooling intent. This depiction of the human need for food is extremely profound, evoking deep empathy.

According to physiology, "the human body is like a furnace." The ability of a furnace to generate heat and perform its function depends on the continuous addition of fuel from above, while the ash is removed from below, forming a metabolism. If only the ash is seen coming out from below, and the fuel is not seen being added from above, then the furnace will inevitably become cold, the fire will go out, like waste, like a rigid stone. Therefore, using the body as a metaphor for a furnace, it is clear that eating and drinking from above is like adding fuel and coal; excretion from below is like removing ash. If people could live without eating, then the many cars in Shanghai would not have to line up early to wait to buy gasoline. (See the newspaper report about the "oil shortage," where car queues experience the hardship of peasants lining up to receive relief grain.) In that case, the fact that Sister Yang "did not eat for nine years but acted as usual" is even more exaggerated than the boastful accounts in Zuo Zhuan about "Lady Xi not speaking for three years!"

### Miscellaneous Poems from Yi Lou

— Shi Shufan

I am surprised to wake up and see the city change! The price of grain and silk is so high it's like they communicate with gods. Deep sorrow fills the houses along the Huangpu River, the setting sun shines on the flag atop the city walls of Daliang. I pray for heaven's favor to bring about a triple change, but in this anxious state, nothing seems right. I wake up and hear the buzzing of mosquitoes everywhere, how dark is the cold night under these fiery clouds?

Grass grows lush, the buildings are deep, surrounded by pomegranate blossoms like fire, where do all these melancholic thoughts come from? The short trees are sparse, heaven is unpredictable, the scattered stars, the night is sad, the cold breath of war dissolves the bones on the plains, and the liver wind causes red palms and thunder in the hands. Imminent danger weighs down, the pure stream is cheap, and I still hear the word "yes" but talents are limited to Chu.

Seeing Fireflies

Why do they fall with the wind and lean with the dew, startling me? Unsteady, fireflies resemble feelings after chaos, I pity their weakness as they struggle in the grass, the foolish red is helpless until dawn.

The sickle moon cleaves the sky, the white dew is deep, in the dew the fireflies rise and fall, watching the stars, I don't believe the heavens are blind, I gaze at the wandering souls, silently.

Yu Yueyuan has a painting by Wannianshao, a gift to Gu Tinglin entitled "Autumn River Parting Thoughts" I once asked to view it, recalling it with a poem

Friendship of life and death comes from the Buddhist gate, silent face to face is even more sorrowful, where do I know you will go carrying the cloth? Another painting of rivers and mountains is gifted to a deceased friend. (At that time, Wannianshao had already become a Buddhist monk, and Gu also changed his clothes to dress like a cloth merchant.)

The ink flows freely, the brush wants to fly, why do I hear the full page lamenting the crisis? From the beginning, they were laughed at in the same way, meddling too much in the rise and fall are commoners.
