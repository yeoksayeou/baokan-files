The Tragedy of His Death Shakes Heaven and Earth

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 18th Dispatch] In this northern Jiangsu campaign, District Chief Luo Chunxian's heroic death in the Battle of Nansishui truly shook heaven and earth and moved gods to tears. The invading Chen bandits numbered about six regiments. District Chief Luo, faced with a sudden attack and the failure to evacuate the populace, led his meager force of 160 self-defense soldiers, determined to defend the area to the death in order to avoid loss of life and property for the people. They fought a bloody battle with the bandits throughout the night.

### Washington Figures Discuss China's Situation: Progress Made in Recent Months; Truman's Policy Will Facilitate Military Aid to China

[US Information Service, Washington, 17th Dispatch] Authoritative figures here believe that the situation in China has generally improved in the past four months. It is reported that a portion of the surplus military supplies from the Pacific region is being shipped to the National Government.

A draft is under consideration, but the government authorities remain firm that the United States should not directly bear the responsibility for the Nanjing government's suppression of the communists.

### Marshall Still Advocates "Europe First" Strategy

Secretary of State Marshall still says the U.S. must resist the pressure to get bogged down in a quagmire so that the limited military strength of the United States is not dispersed, but can be used to counter Soviet aggression in Europe. This is consistent with his strategy during World War II, which focused on Europe as the main theater. Marshall's advisors believe that the country's major needs are a lack of talented generals and the need for better training of the national army. Regarding the issue of talented generals, it is believed that there has been real improvement in recent months. Some generals have been appointed to key positions, and a certain general, whom Marshall privately held largely responsible for the military failures in the Northeast, has been dismissed, all of which are clear evidence.

### Remittances from Silver and Money Exchanges Must Include Real Names

The Ministry of Finance has Formulated Five Measures

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Various silver and money exchanges must use the real names of their customers. The Ministry of Finance has repeatedly formulated measures and ordered them to be followed. Recently, to ensure strict implementation, the ministry has further stipulated that the names and addresses of remitters should also be strictly investigated when handling remittance business. Five new measures have been formulated and circulated for compliance: (1) When conducting domestic remittances, whether by money order or telegraphic transfer, silver and money exchanges must have the remitter fill in the remitter's and payee's real names (or the full name of the organization, company, or factory) and detailed addresses on the remittance application form, and the remitting exchanges must record them in the remittance account at all times, without any omissions. (2) If the payee of a telegraphic transfer is replaced by a telegraphic registration number or the remitting exchange's current account number, the remitter should still be asked to provide the payee's original name and address so that it can be recorded. If the remitter requests that a blank-headed remittance order be issued, the remitter should also be asked to fill in the payee's name and address as a basis for accounting. (3) For all remittances handled by the paying exchange (including remittances left for the payee to collect, remittances entrusted to the paying exchange to collect, and remittances in the nature of traveler's checks, etc.), the remitter should be asked to explain the reason why the address of the person leaving the remittance and the payee is not yet determined, and the remitting exchange should record the reason in the ledger. (4) With the exception of interbank transfers, government fund transfers from military and political agencies, and transfers of funds from production, public utility, and transportation enterprises, which should be handled in the name of the agency or enterprise, the paying exchange should require the payee to provide a reliable guarantee before releasing ordinary customer remittances of 200 million yuan or more per transaction. If the guarantee is not provided and the remittance is released, the remitting exchange will be held responsible if it is found that the payee's name is false or the address does not match. (5) Silver and money exchanges that violate the above provisions will be subject to disciplinary action by the Ministry of Finance, depending on the severity of the circumstances, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 13 and 14 of the Measures for Strengthening the Control of Financial Business.

### On the First Anniversary of the Recapture of Yan'an, The Communist Bandits Proclaim Their Attack Is Within Sight But Unattainable

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 18th Dispatch] For the past half-month, the Communist bandits in northern Shaanxi have been proclaiming that they will attack Yan'an on March 19th. The facts have proven that this is a fantasy, and the impregnable defensive fortifications around Yan'an remain within sight but unattainable for the Communist bandits. Relevant parties today gave reporters an overview of the battlefield in northern Shaanxi to share their impressions on the eve of the first anniversary of the recapture of Yan'an. They stated: Yan'an and Luochuan are important strongholds for us, and it will be difficult for the bandit army to "capture strong points." Bandit troops are appearing between Ganquan and Fuxian, but we still maintain a line of communication between Yan'an and Luochuan, and they are not two isolated "points." The highway line and the four county towns of Hancheng, Heyang, Chengcheng, and Pucheng have been firmly defended by our army from beginning to end, and the bandits do not dare to cross the line. Tongchuan and Yaoxian south of Jin Suoguan are also safe and sound. Between Pucheng and Baishui, the bandit army is currently retreating north, and Baishui will soon be recovered. The two sides' positions are intertwined in the Yichuan and Huanglongshan areas of Yijun in the middle, but they are mostly advantageous to us. Those in Huanglongshan are all local bandits, numbering only a few hundred, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them. However, the security teams and local self-defense forces still need to be strengthened to cooperate with the national army in combat. To defend northern Shaanxi, the people's psychology has recently changed. They have heard and seen the Communist Party's perverse actions, and the truth has been revealed. Therefore, the centripetal force of supporting the central government has become stronger after being tested by this war.

Another meeting will be convened within the next few days for a final decision.

### First Day of National Assembly Representatives' Registration: Ding Xuanxiao First to Sign and Be Filmed

National Assembly representatives began registering on the 18th. Since the State Council approved this congress as the first session (the previous congress was the Constituent National Assembly), the importance of this congress is evident. Although constitutional governance began on December 25th last year, it has been three months now, but the gathering of the constitutional National Assembly is truly the first time.

The National Assembly registration office is located to the right of the National Fire Assembly Hall, which is a newly built building. The offices of several congress groups are squeezed into a row of small rooms, but a large hall is reserved as a lounge. Before the congress opens, this lounge is the registration office. The registration office is well-organized, with signs posted on the walls and pillars indicating where to sign, where to fill out forms, where to collect travel expenses and documents, and where to rest.

If you are a National Assembly representative, when you walk into the registration office, you will be greeted by the signing area. You must present your certificate of election, then leave your name in the signature book, and collect the registration form and accommodation slip. When filling out the accommodation slip, don't forget to indicate where you plan to stay—whether it is your own residence or a guest house or contracted hotel. After filling out the documents and attaching four 2.5-inch headshots, submit them at the counter opposite and collect a copper token, like a token for withdrawing money from a bank. Oh, this should be added: if you don't have photos or forget to bring them? The preparatory committee has prepared them for you, and you can take photos on the spot, using the photography studio's certificate to replace the photos and sending it to the submission area. Then, you can go to the innermost part of the registration office, which is the lounge, and help yourself to some refreshments. When the issuing office announces the number according to the copper token, you can go there to retrieve a document bag. The document bag includes the following miscellaneous items:

(1) A representative badge, (2) a representative handbook, (3) a directory of registered representatives in Beijing, (4) a receipt for the certificate of election, (5) two postcards for representatives to change their communication address in Beijing, (6) a representative accommodation certificate or hotel introduction slip, (7) a representative payment voucher, (8) a copy of the congress traffic management rules, (9) a copy of the congress shuttle bus rules, (10) a congress representative vehicle survey form, (11) a commission for the congress return or travel to various places during the congress to purchase ticket notification form.

With the "Representative Payment Voucher," you can walk back and receive payment at the payment office. Simply sign and stamp the printed receipt, and you will receive 3.6 million yuan for meals and 4.5 million yuan for accommodation (5 million yuan for official expenses will be issued one week after the opening of the congress). If you want to contact transportation, the staff at the transportation liaison office are waiting for you; if you have matters to commission or inquire about, the inquiry office or service office is also waiting for you. In this way, the registration procedures are completed. If it is not crowded, it only takes four minutes from beginning to end.

Just as more than ninety staff members were quietly waiting for the representatives, the first representative came to register, it was Ding Baoxiao, the regional representative from Jurong County, Jiangsu Province. The Central News Agency photographer and some photojournalists, who had been preparing for a long time, wanted to capture the signing of the first person to register, so Representative Ding became the object of "opening the curtain". In order to make a movie, he was "directed" to pose, and the verification, signing, form collection, form filling, document submission, document retrieval, and payment collection were all filmed, inevitably delaying him a bit. At this time, the second representative to register also arrived. This was Jin Zhen, who came from the artillery, the former mayor of Shenyang, and now participating in the National Assembly as a national border ethnic Manchu representative. No one filmed him, so his procedures were completed quickly, he received the document bag, and obtained the number one badge. When Representative Ding finished filming with a smiling face, he realized that the number one badge had been taken by Mr. Jin. This inevitably caused a small negotiation, he was the first person to register and should receive the number one badge, but the artillery lieutenant general (Jin Zhen) said well: "You have already been on camera, so leave the number one badge to me."

The representatives came sporadically, and the number was not large. The congress staff had nothing to do, and some staff members were using refreshments in the lounge. The refreshments were catered by the Peacock Restaurant of the Central Hotel, and the representatives could take them at will without paying.

Several representatives came without their certificates of election. After inquiring, they could not register, so they had to leave and wait to receive their certificates of election before coming again. In one morning, only seven representatives registered, and the staff exclaimed: "Business is slow." The registration time is from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. More people registered in the afternoon, but the total number for the day was only seventeen. It is said that this is because many people did not know that registration started today, and many people have not yet received their certificates of election. It is estimated that there will be more than 2,700 representatives attending this meeting, and most of them will register at the same time in the few days before the opening, which will be a tense and chaotic scene in the future.

Sun Ke, Mo Dexian, Xu Chuanlin, Liu Dongyan, and Secretary-General Hong Lanyou, who are responsible for preparing for the congress, visited the registration office at 9:30 AM. Besides Hong Lanyou, there was exactly one person each from the Kuomintang, the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and social elites. Photojournalists rushed to take photos of them. Sun Ke and others went around the venue, looked at the various arrangements and the staff's work, and nodded repeatedly, expressing their satisfaction.

The work of representative registration has begun. This work will continue until the opening of the congress, and many people are asking: "When will Chairman Chiang come to register?" (Sent from Nanjing on March 18th)

Editorial

### After President Truman's Two Speeches

US President Truman's speech to a joint session of both houses of Congress the day before yesterday is undoubtedly the most important historical document since the end of World War II. From now on, we will have to see how the American people and all countries that love democracy and peace react to President Truman's speech.

In the past half month, the situation in Europe has taken a sharp turn for the worse, almost reaching the final stage of the "Cold War," causing US President Truman, standing on the other side of the Atlantic, to begin to show that his confidence in world peace was wavering. However, the United States after World War II bears a special responsibility in terms of morality and history for maintaining world peace, and its words and actions are related to the safety of the world. Therefore, the people of the whole world, especially those who are threatened by the communist forces, are looking forward to the movements in Washington. At the same time, President Truman himself is deeply aware of the current global crisis and the great responsibility of the United States, and is eager to awaken the vigilance of the American government and the public. Therefore, a few days ago, he decided to deliver a speech to a joint session of both houses of Congress, clarifying the world situation and requesting Congress to take necessary steps to save the situation before it is too late. This diplomatic speech is not only valued by the American government and the public, but also by the people of all countries in the world; in the moment before President Truman delivered his speech, the people of the whole world were probably holding their breath and listening to President Truman's roar.

Now, we have finally heard President Truman's speech on the radio, and at the same time read the full text of this important speech in the telegram. The main points of the speech are summarized as follows: (1) The survival of democracy has been threatened, and it is time for the free men and women of the world to bravely confront the threats to their freedom. (2) The United States must maintain its strong strength to support European countries that are still free and feel threatened by communism and the rule of police states. (3) We must be prepared to pay the price of peace, otherwise we will inevitably pay the price of war. (4) He called for the temporary restoration of the draft and the implementation of universal military training to cope with the serious situation caused by the continuous aggression of the Soviet Union. (5) He requested that Congress act quickly on the $5.3 billion European recovery plan. (6) Our ability to quickly assemble and train a large number of well-trained troops in times of crisis can prevent future conflicts from occurring, and other national policies can restore world stability. (7) Implementing universal military training is enough to declare to the world that we are a support for peace, not only with great determination, but also with the power to achieve peace. (8) We should, regardless of party affiliation, organize a united front and unite with all countries in the world to make every possible effort to maintain world peace.

President Truman's speech was drafted by the President himself in consultation with political, diplomatic, military, and economic experts, and every sentence has a purpose and every word has weight, but because the speech time was only twenty minutes, it could not be explained in detail. However, after President Truman attended the joint session of Congress, he immediately flew to New York to attend the St. Peter's Dinner and gave a speech, more frankly criticizing the Soviet Union's attempt to establish authoritarian rule in the still free countries of Western Europe, and pointed out that communism denies God and does not recognize the right of mankind to self-government, and is in fact a tyranny. He also said that the existence of democracy is currently threatened by communism, and the United States has become the only protector of the free world. At this time, we should unite our strength with the strength of other free people to fight against communism. Therefore, we should use military, economic, and moral strength to support these countries. Although the contents of the two speeches are different, in our opinion, the latter is more powerful and more frank than the former. However, if President Truman only roars and condemns the Soviet Union's aggression and criticizes the communist threat to freedom verbally, and the United States still cannot immediately take effective actions in all aspects to stop the flood of communist forces, then we cannot be sure whether the world's chaos can be immediately reversed.

Looking at Europe in the past half month, the situation is crystallizing. On the one hand, there was first the coup in Czechoslovakia. After the Czech communists seized power, the tragedy of democracy has been repeated. Later, the Soviet Union forced Finland to conclude a mutual assistance treaty. Although it is still in the negotiation stage, Finland, forced by the general trend, is afraid that it will only obey orders. Recently, Europe has been filled with alarming rumors, either that the Soviet Union will take action against Turkey, or that the Soviet Union will require the Nordic countries of Norway and Sweden to sign alliances. The upcoming general election in Italy and the activities of the Communist Party are even more shocking. On the other hand, diplomatic activities are also quite lively. The London Conference decided to merge the three occupied areas of West Germany, and the Bejing Five-Nation Conference has also completed the drafting of the Western European Five-Nation Alliance Treaty, which was signed and established in Paris yesterday, and there is a possibility of expansion. In addition, the European Sixteen-Nation Conference is also being held in Paris. Regardless of the attitude of the representatives of various countries or the course of the meeting, it is enough to show that the countries of Western Europe are united in good faith, unanimously dealing with the threat of communism. Although the United States did not directly participate, the United States is in fact the "guardian" of democratic and free countries, which is an undeniable fact. After reading President Truman's speech, we can especially believe that the US aid policy to Europe will gradually evolve from economic aid to military aid. From this point of view, in addition to the unity of Western European countries themselves, coupled with the full support of the United States, it is logically hoped that the European situation will gradually become clear. However, why hasn't President Truman's speech stabilized the hearts of the world? We believe there are at least two reasons;

First, today's bipolarization of Europe is even more serious than the situation after the Munich Conference in 1938. The aggressor in the past was Nazi Germany. Although Hitler owned Austria and part of Czechoslovakia at that time, the nine countries in Eastern Europe had allied relations with Britain and France. In addition, France was the most powerful country in Europe at that time, and further east, there was a third force - the Soviet Union - restraining it. Looking back at today's Europe, because totalitarian communist countries are always taking the lead, and democratic countries are lagging behind in everything, these two major groups have almost reached a point where their strengths are evenly matched and cannot be compared, both in terms of population and area. Moreover, from the point of view of geographical location or military strategy, the Eastern European group has an advantage, which seems to be beyond the reach of the Western European group. Therefore, the establishment of the Western European Alliance is important today. The five countries of Western Europe not only need to help each other to stop the Soviet Union's military aggression, but also need to work together to prevent the activities of the fifth column within the country. However, according to official observations, its role may not be as great as the world imagines, and looking forward to its future, it is full of thorns, and it is unlikely to be smooth sailing, so we cannot be too optimistic.

Second, although President Truman has frankly expressed his anti-communist stance and frankly announced his support for democratic and free countries, his focus is still on Europe. In particular, General Marshall is still clinging to his belief that "Europe is more important than Asia" and openly stated that he is unwilling to engage in a "cold war" on two fronts, as if the Asian Chinese side is not worthy of attention. This is where a major crisis is lurking. Our newspaper's editorial will again point out the national nature of communism, which cannot be divided into important and unimportant. The Soviet Union is currently expanding its power simultaneously in Europe and Asia. If the US authorities only know one and not the other, only know the crisis in Europe and not the seriousness of the situation in Asia, then no matter what steps the United States takes, it may not be enough to stop the expansion of communist forces. It must be known that if China falls into the hands of communist rulers, with the entire red China supporting the communist camp, the map of all of Asia will change color, and the United States on the other side of the Pacific may not be able to sleep soundly. Therefore, President Truman's two speeches did not mention China, which is on the front line of anti-communism, and we really cannot help but express our regrets. We would like to reiterate to the American government and the public that the policy of Europe first and Asia later will indeed lead to irreparable disasters. If we do not quickly change course, we will inevitably repeat the mistakes and make a historical mistake!

### 27 of Our Ancient Paintings Returned by the Japanese Government Yesterday, All Treasures of Zhang Xueliang

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] Twenty-seven famous Chinese silk paintings of the Ming and Qing dynasties (totaling fifty-six) looted by Japan were returned to our country on the morning of the 18th. It is said that these are the most precious ancient books that can be found in the country, and were given by Zhang Xueliang to the Shenyang Museum before the Shenyang Incident. After the incident, they were looted by the Japanese and sent to Japan in 1943, re-mounted. They were originally scheduled to be returned to Shenyang after being re-mounted, but due to the sudden end of the war, they were preserved in the Imperial Museum of the National Tokyo Museum. Wu Bannong, head of the Compensation and Return Group of our country's delegation to Japan, said: It is not yet known whether each painting will be returned to Zhang. It is believed that because they are precious and rare, each painting should be regarded as state-owned property. Among the twenty-seven paintings, six are Ming paintings and twenty-one are works from the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, including ink treasures of Zhu Zhishan and Emperor Qianlong. Each painting has bright colors and is mostly of flowers and signed divine images. The marks on the paintings indicate that they were purchased by Zhang Zuolin and Zhang Xueliang from Zhu Qiling, who was the Prime Minister under Yuan Shikai. The paintings will be exhibited at the delegation on March 23 with jade screens, jade vases, etc. recently returned by Japan. Journalists from the Allied countries here have been invited to visit. The date of transporting the paintings back to China has not yet been determined.

### China National Aviation Corporation Plane Forced to Land in Zhan Yi, Has Safely Flown to Kunming

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 18th] The China National Aviation Corporation flight from Shanghai to Kunming on the 16th, after being forced to land in Zhan Yi that night, had eight male passengers and twenty women and children. Yesterday, a special plane dispatched by the company's Kunming station flew to Zhan Yi to transfer them to Kunming. The plane that was forced to land also flew to Kunming at the same time. According to the passengers, the plane left Shanghai on the morning of the 16th, originally scheduled to fly to Kunming via Hankou and Liuzhou. When they learned that the weather in Liuzhou was bad, they changed their route to fly directly from Hankou. At about 5:00 PM, when they flew over the mountains and valleys of the Yunnan border, the right engine suddenly failed, and they encountered a strong wind and rain. They managed to fly for half an hour, but the fuselage lost its balance, so they threw away dozens of packages of mail and luggage, and continued to fly to Zhan Yi and landed. The situation at the time was extremely critical, but the passengers and crew members were very calm, so they were able to land safely and congratulate each other on their rebirth.

### Prices in Suzhou and Wuxi Are Rising Again

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 18th] Prices here have been affected by the rise in the US dollar exchange rate, and a comprehensive price increase has started again today.

### Improvement Planned for Taiwan's Water Conservancy

[Our Nanjing Office, 18th dispatch] Shen Baixian, along with Shi Chengxi, an inspector from the Ministry, and He Zhenxing, a technician, and nine others, left Nanjing on the 25th of last month to inspect water conservancy in Taiwan. After spending more than half a month there, they returned to Nanjing on the 18th. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Shen shared his impressions from the inspection, stating: “Since Taiwan came under Japanese rule, they implemented colonial policies, exploiting everything like raising chickens for eggs. They vigorously developed irrigation canals and hydroelectric projects and organized local water conservancy groups to assist in their development. Statistics show that the area of irrigated farmland reached over 530,000 hectares, and the length of flood-control embankments exceeded 400,000 meters. However, in the two years leading up to the victory [end of WWII], Japan, struggling to cope, saw all water conservancy facilities damaged by the excavation of defensive fortifications. By the eve of restoration [of Taiwan to China], the area of farmland lacking irrigation reached approximately 200,000 hectares, and around 40,000 meters of embankments were damaged. After the restoration, with the cooperation of water conservancy personnel from the provincial government and water conservancy groups from various counties, over 20,000 meters of embankments have been repaired, and most of the farmland lacking irrigation has been restored.” Mr. Shen also discussed Taiwan’s water conservancy work plan for the current year, which includes plans to repair over 20,000 meters of embankments before the flood season and to strengthen farmland irrigation projects, etc. The total project costs are estimated at over 4.5 billion Taiwan dollars from the provincial treasury and 1.5 billion Taiwan dollars raised locally. He added that the basic-level staff of Taiwan’s water conservancy organizations are lacking in expertise. During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese only provided Taiwanese with some engineering education and work experience, while Japanese personnel filled the senior technical and management positions. This shortcoming should be improved. In the future, the province’s water conservancy efforts should focus on the entire river basin to achieve comprehensive control.

### ### Assasin of Xu Shoushang, Gao Wanfu, Sentenced to Death

[Our Taipei Office, 18th dispatch] Gao Wanfu, the murderer in the Xu Shoushang case, was sentenced to death by the District Court at 9:00 AM on the 18th, with permanent deprivation of civil rights.

### Slow Progress in Returning Plundered Materials from Japan

My Suggestions Being Considered to Expedite Progress

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th dispatch] Wu Ban-chen, chairman of our country’s Repatriation and Restitution Committee in Japan, told reporters that the Far Eastern Commission is currently studying our country’s suggestion to adopt a "lenient" restitution policy to facilitate the return of materials. Wu believes that the main reason for the slow progress of the restitution work is the various restrictions imposed by the Far Eastern Commission. The Commission places too much emphasis on evidence, making it impossible for our Commission to claim compensation for a large number of losses where evidence is lacking. For example, during the war, Japan plundered 200 motor vehicles from our country, but due to lack of evidence, we can now only claim the return of four vehicles. It is not surprising that documents are insufficient or missing, as documents that could serve as evidence were partially or completely lost during the war. The second obstacle to the restitution work is the lack of direct contact between the Commission and the Japanese government. Otherwise, the Commission could obtain more clues about the plundered items. Over the past year, the Commission has worked hard, but due to the above reasons, the results obtained are far from what was expected. The Commission's achievements in the past include: the entire equipment of the Yongli Chemical Company, the largest nitric acid manufacturer in our country, with a capacity of 1,500 cubic tons, which was taken from Nanjing to Japan, will soon be shipped back on the Hai'e [Seagull] wheel [ship] sailing to Japan. In addition, some iron statues and iron bells plundered from our country's temples will also be transported back to our country on the same ship. The Guangzhou Paper Mill, which was also completely moved to Hokkaido by Japan, will soon be dismantled and returned. The machinery of the Tianjin Sanjia Ban [Plywood] Company and the Shanghai Parker Davis Factory will also be returned, and the latter will be handed over to the United States. The Commission recently negotiated for the return of some machinery from the South China Iron and Steel Company, which was organized by Zeng Yangfu to manufacture automobiles. Of the 3,000 pieces of machinery from the Northwest Industrial Company, organized by Yan Xishan, that were shipped to Japan, 1,000 pieces have been found and will soon be transported back. Other returned items include four ships, four motor vehicles, 35,000 rare books, and 95,000 ordinary books. Two other warships may also be returned to our country recently.

### Tang Shizun Flies to Nanjing

### Communist Bandit Area Exports Drugs, Another Case Cracked in Tianjin

### Burma Since Independence

— Our Reporter Yuan Wenzhong

On January 4, 1948, the Blue Sky White Sun banner flew high over the land of Burma. The Union of Burma, with an area of over 260,000 square miles and a population of over 14 million, was thus freed from the 61-year rule of the British Empire, beginning her new life of independence and autonomy.

Independence Ceremony

On March 11th, Lord Mountbatten and his wife flew from Calcutta to Rangoon. On the 12th, they presided over the ceremony of returning the Burmese throne, completing the final ritual of Burmese independence. The press corps took the first flight of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) between China and Burma to visit Burma, and it coincided with this event, so we were able to participate in this most precious and exciting moment in Burmese history. The Burmese throne was built in 1875 by King Mindon in Mandalay. It is 30 feet and 10 inches high, gilded, and shaped much like a Chinese paifang. There are steps at the back to go up. In 1885, the British captured Mandalay, and the Burmese king was exiled to Bombay. In 1902, Lord Curzon dismantled the throne, packed it into 36 boxes, and transported it to India, where it was displayed in the Indian Museum until now. After Burma became independent, the throne was shipped back to Rangoon from India in 60 sections on February 6th and reassembled in the hall of what used to be the Governor's Office and is now the Presidential Palace. The ceremony presided over by Mountbatten took place in this city hall. On that day, there were hundreds of people including foreign envoys, guests, and Burmese commissioners participating. The ceremony was very simple, with only Mountbatten and the Burmese President each reading a moving speech. The curtain covering the seats of honor was unveiled by Mountbatten, and at the same time the Burmese national anthem was played, thus the form of Burmese independence was successfully completed. Although Mountbatten was still so handsome, he seemed to carry a tired and indifferent expression throughout the ceremony. It is not difficult for people to understand how this lord, who was performing the task of removing a jewel from the British Empire's crown, felt.

Britain Holds the Trump Card

Thus, Britain officially withdrew from the political stage in Burma, but in military and economic terms, she still holds the invincible trump card. The Anglo-Burmese Defense Agreement signed on August 29, 1947, stipulated that British troops should withdraw as soon as possible and that all military equipment should be transferred to the Burmese government. In addition, both sides agreed that Britain should send a military advisory group of the navy, army, and air force to train the Burmese army. The Burmese government must not accept military advisors from other countries other than Britain. "Both sides'" naval vessels may enter each other's territory with notification, and "both sides'" air force planes may fly over each other's territory with notification. "Both sides'" armies may also enter each other's territory when necessary. This agreement is provisionally valid for three years. In other words, British military power in Burma can be controlled for at least three years. Economically, Burma's largest industries and businesses are still firmly in the hands of the British. Several large companies, such as the Burma Oil Company, the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company, and Steel Brothers & Co., control Burma's industry, shipping, and commerce. Their deep-rooted power cannot be shaken in a short period of time.

Government Personnel

Even so, Burma is finally independent. The current Burmese government claims to be an anti-fascist, left-leaning government. It was originally composed of three political parties: the Socialist Party, the People's Volunteer Organization, and the Communist Party, and was named the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL). However, after coming to power, the Communist Party withdrew due to disagreements over its political program and split into the Red Flag Communist Party and the White Flag Communist Party. The Red Flag is the most leftist radical party and has now been declared an illegal party by the government. The White Flag is more moderate, but it also refuses to cooperate with the government. In addition, the right-wing opposition parties include the Dobama Asiayone, the Patriotic Party, and the People's Party. In last year's world-shaking Burmese coup, Aung San, chairman of the AFPFL, was assassinated by U Saw, leader of the Patriotic Party. U Saw was recently sentenced to death by the court. Prime Minister Thakin Nu, the vice-chairman of the AFPFL, holds the actual power.

Clarifying Policies

Regarding the current government's policies, Thakin Nu elaborated in detail at the Constituent Assembly. He said: "Why should Burma go to the left? Because Burma's wealth is completely concentrated in the hands of the first British, second Indian, and third Chinese capitalists. The Burmese common people live in the lowest level of poverty, gnawing on the bones left by others. This kind of unfair situation must be eliminated, but its meaning is not to create a small number of Burmese capitalists to replace the British, Indian, and Chinese capitalists, while the majority of the people remain poor and suffering. Therefore, the government's policy is to establish a system that benefits all the people, so that all the people can enjoy its benefits. This policy is not radical, and it cannot be successful overnight. This policy is not completely Soviet-style either, because Burma's geographical environment is not as close to the Soviet Union as Czechoslovakia or Bulgaria. The most important task of the Burmese government today is to do its utmost to make the country strong. Only when the country is stronger can we move further forward!"

Economic Status Quo

Indeed, until now, Burma's wealth is completely in the hands of the British, Indians, and Chinese. The British are far above, while the Indians and Overseas Chinese hold the middle and lower levels of industry and commerce. In the downtown area of Rangoon, it is simply the world of the British, Indians, and Overseas Chinese. It is rare to see shops opened by Burmese people. The Burmese government is now striving to move towards national economic socialism. It announced a real estate law prohibiting the sale or mortgage of real estate in Burma to foreigners, but this only affects the Overseas Chinese, while British and Indian residents can still be an exception. It also controls import and export trade, stipulating that 50 percent of the quota should be given to Burmese merchants, but because the Burmese merchants themselves do not have this ability, they either transfer the license or cooperate with foreigners, so the results are still obtained by foreign merchants. It also wants to nationalize the mining industry, but because of financial difficulties, it cannot afford to pay the purchase price, so it is unlikely to be realized in the near future.

### Marshall Emphasizes the Need to Strengthen Military Strength, Urges Congress to Make Decisions and Take Action, Military Leaders Also Attend Senate to Testify

[Our Report] New York, 18th Broadcast: Washington News, Secretary of Defense Forrestal and Secretary of the Army Royal presented their views to the Senate Armed Services Committee today, advocating for an increase in the currently stipulated military strength and strongly supporting President Truman's proposed implementation of universal conscription and temporary restoration of [the] draft. Mr. Chen [Forrestal] stated that the current stipulated military strength is based on assumptions made two years ago, which have not been realized. He did not provide exact figures but said that definite recommendations could only be made after detailed research. Mr. Forrestal stated that the stipulated strength of the Army is 669,000, but there are only 560,000 people currently serving; the stipulated strength of the Navy is 664,000, and only 474,000 are currently serving; the stipulated strength of the Air Force is 471,000, and only 362,000 are currently serving. These figures show that the current shortage is 400,800 people. However, Mr. Forrestal previously estimated the shortage to be 350,000 people. Congressional Republican leaders remain lukewarm to universal conscription, but they are not overly opposed to implementing a new draft. Mr. Forrestal strongly argued that we must not hold the view that the existence of atomic bombs means that a large number of personnel are no longer needed.

[US Information Service, Washington, 17th dispatch] After President Truman requested Congress today to re-establish conscription and formulate universal conscription, Secretary of State Marshall issued a statement urging Congress to take decisive action to show "America's determination to maintain a strong strength to maintain peace and freedom in the European world." Secretary Marshall made this statement to the Senate Military Committee. The Committee began public discussions today on the issue of universal conscription and on the President's request to restore the draft and increase the strength of the national armed forces to an appropriate level. The universal conscription bill has been successfully reported in the House Military Committee, but the House Rules Committee has not yet presented the bill on the floor.

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall testified before the Senate Military Committee today that without military strength, diplomatic actions in the current world situation can only lead to appeasement. The Committee should discuss the National Youth Military Training Act and the Temporary Conscription Act, and the US Air Force expansion program also needs to be considered. Mr. Marshall said that the temporary Conscription Act is the only way to quickly replenish the troops to full strength. In the case of Korea, the garrison commander requested an increase in troops to 38,000, but the Army Department only sent 30,000, and even that number could not be fully deployed due to personnel shortages. On February 8 of this year, there were a total of 18,000 troops stationed in Korea, and recent reports show that there are only 15,000 troops, and this garrison is still shrinking. Mr. Marshall also said that the Italian elections on the 18th of this month are far more important than local events in that country. This move will not only determine whether Italy can restore true democracy but will also foreshadow a trend of division, which may extend to the shores of the Atlantic.

[United Press, Washington, 17th dispatch] The US Army Department revealed on the 17th that it is drafting a plan to restore the Selective Service System based on President Truman's request to Congress to approve a temporary conscription system to help curb the spread of the Soviet Union.

### On President Truman's Policy Declaration: Western European Nations Express Welcome; Moscow Indicates Political Motivation

[United Press International, London, 18th] Western European nations unanimously praised President Truman's message as a "New Monroe Doctrine," providing a basis for the European Recovery Program. The number of people listening to the message, from the Arctic Ocean to Africa, broke all previous records, and its acclaim was unprecedented since the war. Moscow Radio, exceptionally, broadcast Truman's message to the entire Soviet population in the early morning.

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 18th Broadcast: Moscow claims that President Truman deliberately created a crisis in his speech yesterday to serve his party's interests.

[Reuters, London, 17th] Diplomatic circles here feel that President Truman's call for Congress to reinstate conscription, implement universal military training, and quickly pass the aid to Europe bill implies a military guarantee for the five-nation Western European Union treaty. The consolidation of the global anti-communist front has achieved unprecedented success in the past 24 hours. Following the agreement by sixteen European nations in Paris yesterday to establish a permanent economic cooperation organization, the UK, France, Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg formed a military mutual assistance pact in Brussels today. Ninety minutes later, President Truman in Washington frankly expressed his willingness to provide Western European countries with any needed military assistance. This series of significant actions occurring within a short 24 hours is truly rare in history.

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] President Truman's speech to Congress has made a profound and significant impression on French officials and the public. While it was generally expected that Truman would make a strong statement, few anticipated such specific recommendations and such blatant warnings to the Soviet Union. It is also believed here that Truman's support for the Western European five-nation pact is tantamount to declaring that in the event of the circumstances described in the five-nation pact, and the five nations engage in self-defense, the United States will participate in military intervention. The US President's particular emphasis on affirmative and proactive action, rather than just verbal intimidation of the Soviet Union, is especially welcomed by responsible officials here.

[Associated Press, London, 17th] Western Europe unanimously expressed admiration for Truman's declaration tonight. In Rome, government officials believe that Truman's speech is highly relevant to Italy. In The Hague, the Dutch Foreign Ministry considers it a great encouragement to Western Europe.

### Positive Reaction from US Congressional Leaders

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] A senior US official told our agency that Truman's decision to request the reinstatement of conscription was significantly influenced by British Foreign Secretary Bevin. After Bevin informed Marshall that verbal protests alone were insufficient to halt communist expansion and would only demonstrate the West's impotence, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith was the first to propose the reinstatement of conscription. Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated, "Truman's speech is a speech for peace. If domestic communists attempt to rely on foreign support to undermine domestic unity, the speech will become a speech for war." Republican Senator Taft stated, "Truman has made clear his and our unified determination to prevent the expansion of communism as much as possible." Representative Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, stated that he would do everything possible to meet Truman's request for the swift passage of the European Recovery Program. Meanwhile, the Senate Armed Services Committee announced that it would begin reviewing the conscription and universal military training requests immediately, with Secretary of State Marshall being the first to testify.

### UK and Transjordan Sign New Treaty of Alliance

Emphasis on Military Mutual Assistance

[Associated Press, London, 17th] The new treaty of alliance signed by the UK and Transjordan in Amman last Monday was announced here today, stipulating that if one of the signatory countries is at war or faces a threat of war, it may request the other party to send troops to assist. The UK may establish two air force bases in Transjordan and may train troops. The UK and Transjordan shall form a joint defense committee to determine the location of British troops stationed there. The UK agrees to supply Transjordan with military equipment, arms, aircraft, and other materials, and agrees to provide financial assistance to the King of Transjordan. The UK agrees to send officers to train the Transjordanian army. The treaty is valid for twenty years.

### Czech Coup Case Added to Security Council Agenda

Chilean Representative Invited to Attend and Present Arguments

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 17th] The Security Council, disregarding the strong opposition from the Soviet Union and Ukraine, began discussing the case in which the former Czech representative accused the Soviet Union of manipulating the Czech coup. The Security Council voted nine to two to include in the Council's agenda the accusation that the Soviet Union manipulated the Czech coup, which was initially proposed by former Czech representative Papánek and formally supported by the Chilean government. The Security Council also voted nine to two (with the Soviet Union and Ukraine voting against) to invite the Chilean representative to attend the meeting and state their recommendations.

The Security Council decided today, after nearly two hours of debate in an unprecedented atmosphere of tension, to consider this highly explosive Czech issue. The public gallery of the Security Council was packed today, and emotions ran high during the proceedings. The Chairman of the Security Council, our representative Jiang Tingfu, repeatedly tried to suppress cheers and applause.

### US House Foreign Affairs Committee Passes $5.3 Billion Aid to Europe Bill; House of Representatives May Begin Debate Next Week

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee today, in a closed-door meeting, approved the $5.3 billion Aid to Europe Bill, stipulating that $1 billion of this amount will be loaned by the Export-Import Bank. In other words, Congress only needs to directly allocate $4.3 billion. The total amount of this bill is the same as that passed by the Senate, and it is for one year. Committee Chairman Eaton told reporters afterward that other foreign aid bills would be decided on later, including the $570 million economic aid to China bill and the $275 million second military aid bill to Greece and Turkey.

[United Press International, Washington, 17th] The House plans to include aid to China and aid to Greece and Turkey in this bill. This comprehensive bill is expected to be debated in the House on the 23rd, and a final decision may be made at the end of March or the beginning of April.

### Menon Delivers Speech Hoping for Korean Unification

[Associated Press, Seoul, 18th] UN Representative to Korea, Indian representative Menon, stated in a radio address today that the mission will oversee the Korean parliamentary elections on May 9, and then assist the parliament in organizing the South Korean government. It is hoped that North and South Korea will be unified in the future.

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] The US-occupied zone in southern Korea is scheduled to hold elections on May 9. This is another step in the US effort to promote Korean independence and strengthen democracy in the Far East. According to a certain US diplomatic official, "We do not imagine that this move will solve all the current problems in Korea. The upcoming vote is experimental in nature and far from the universal election we imagine." The future Korean government will have a president, prime minister, cabinet, and other official positions, all of which will be elected by parliament. It is expected here that Korean right-wing leader Syngman Rhee will serve as speaker. It is said that Rhee is eager to become the president of the Korean Republic, but if North Korea does not participate, the future of the Republican government remains uncertain.

### Truman Delivers Political Speech, Severely Criticizes Wallace - At the St. Patrick's Day Banquet

[Associated Press, New York, 17th] Today is the Irish patron saint St. Patrick's Day. After announcing his policy in Congress, President Truman flew here, accompanied by New York Governor Dewey, to review the traditional Irish flower parade. He delivered a speech at the commemorative banquet in the evening.

[United Press International, New York, 18th] President Truman this evening changed his original text and delivered a political speech, discussing America's preparedness and diplomacy. He stated frankly that under no circumstances would he accept political assistance from "Wallace and certain communists." He stated, "If participating with them or letting them cooperate with me is the price of victory, then I would rather fail." (Truman has announced that he will run for re-election as president). Truman's words were met with thunderous applause from the audience. Truman strongly criticized the "vain hope that peace can be obtained by shouting for peace" and the erroneous notion that "everything is fine in the world." The original text of Truman's speech stated that he had requested Congress that morning to temporarily reinstate conscription laws so that America's military strength would be sufficient to be the "main protector of the free world." Truman's tenure as president has been a time of many troubles, and this criticism of Wallace has brought matters to a climax. Wallace has been highly critical of Truman's foreign policy, and he sent a telegram to congressional leaders on the 17th stating that the government was inciting "war hysteria." Wallace is scheduled to broadcast on Thursday evening to respond to Truman's congressional message, and is sure to respond to Truman's statement about "communists." Truman and his party boarded a special train on the evening of the 17th and are expected to return to Washington on Thursday morning.

### Five-Nation Alliance Includes Secret Treaty; UK and France Have Denied It; British Prime Minister Says Treaty is Not Directed at Any Other Country

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 17th] The claim that the Brussels five-nation alliance treaty contains a secret military agreement and that Marshal Montgomery has been appointed as the Supreme Commander of the Western European Allied Forces has been firmly denied by the foreign ministries of both the UK and France.

[Reuters, London, 17th] Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons today that the five-nation alliance treaty has been signed in Brussels. He emphasized that this treaty is not directed at any other country. This is not an ordinary treaty, nor is it a pact based on self-interest and fear. It is an alliance formed by like-minded neighboring countries seeking closer social and spiritual unity. Its principles are in line with Britain's good neighbor policy and are definitely not directed at any other country.

### Ashida's Policy Speech Scheduled for Tomorrow

Yoshida Prepares to Launch a Movement to Overthrow the Cabinet

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] Prime Minister Ashida's policy speech is scheduled to be delivered at the plenary sessions of both houses on the 20th. The lineup for the Socialist Party's questions is expected to be led by Inejiro Asanuma, followed by Mitsuaki Yonekubo.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] Prime Minister Ashida attended the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 17th and delivered a speech on the future of Japan's economy this year, stating: "I believe that the future of Japan's economy this year is the first year of hope since the war."

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 18th] Japan's new political party, the Democratic Liberal Party, will move to dissolve the parliament in parliament in the sixth week, in an attempt to overthrow the Ashida cabinet. However, it is necessary to know in advance whether MacArthur's headquarters will agree to hold new elections.

### Zhang Pengchun Arrives in London

Will Attend the Conference on Freedom of Information

[Central News Agency, London, 18th] Zhang Pengchun, the head of the Chinese delegation to the International Conference on Freedom of Information, arrived here last night from New York en route to Geneva.

### Four Powers Demand Security Council Immediately End Holy Land War

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 17th] The four powers, in a trial-like agreement on the night of the 17th, requested the United Nations Security Council to take immediate steps to end the Palestinian conflict.

### US Labor Unrest Spreads, Affecting Steel Industry

[Associated Press, Chicago, 17th] The labor unrest involving over 500,000 workers in the bituminous coal and meat industries has begun to spread to steel production. According to an investigation by the Associated Press, it is confirmed that most of the workers of the United Mine Workers of America under the leadership of Lewis and the meatpacking workers belonging to the Congress of Industrial Organizations have already gone on strike. The number of strikers has now increased to 505,590.

### National General Election Next Month; Italian Troops Move North to Prevent Incidents

[Associated Press, Rome, 17th] An official here stated that before the general election on April 18, Italian regular troops will be moved to barracks near the four major strategic cities under Communist control in northern Italy to prevent any illegal seizure of power. These four cities are Milan, Turin, Bologna, and Cremona, which are the largest strongholds of the Italian Communist Party. This official news stated that a brigade of troops will be sent to Milan on April 1, followed by Bologna. However, Ministry of Defense officials did not disclose the number of troops being moved. Currently, there are a total of 575,000 Italian troops.

### Full Text of Truman's Speech

[From the United States News Agency, Washington, 17th] The full text of Truman's speech is as follows: "I am here today to report to you on the seriousness of the situation in Europe and to suggest actions for your consideration: Europe is undergoing rapid changes, which will affect our foreign policy and our national security. For those nations striving to maintain a form of government that grants freedom to the people, there is now an increasing threat. The United States is deeply concerned about the preservation of these nations' freedom. To maintain the conditions under which we can achieve a lasting peace based on freedom and justice, we must take action now. Achieving this peace has always been the great goal of our country.

Almost three years have passed since the end of the greatest war in history, yet peace and stability have not returned to the world. We know that the end of the war does not automatically solve the problems it caused. Building peace after a war has always been a difficult task. Even if all the Allied nations in World War II shared a common desire to build a just and honorable peace, there were still enormous difficulties in reaching this goal.

But today's world situation is not primarily the result of the natural difficulties that arise after a war. It is mainly due to one nation that has not only refused to cooperate in establishing a just and honorable peace but—worse—has actively worked to prevent it.

Congress is very familiar with the progress of the situation.

You know that democratic countries have sincerely and patiently attempted to find a solid foundation for peace through negotiations and agreements. Conferences have been held time and again in different parts of the world. We have tried to resolve the problems caused by the war on a basis that would allow a fair peace to be established. You know the difficulties we have encountered, but the past record stands like a monument, upright, proving the loyalty and integrity of the world's democracies. The agreements we have reached, though not perfect, can provide a basis for a fair peace—provided that these agreements are observed.

But the agreements have not been observed.

These agreements have been repeatedly scorned and violated by one nation.

Congress is also very familiar with the development of the United Nations. The majority of the world's nations have united within the United Nations, striving to establish a world order based on law rather than force. The majority of nations warmly and sincerely support the United Nations and are working to make it stronger and more effective.

But one nation has repeatedly abused the veto power, obstructing the work of the United Nations. In the period of two years and some months, this nation has vetoed twenty-one proposed actions.

But that is not enough. Since the end of the war, the Soviet Union and its agents have destroyed the independence and democratic character of a series of countries in Eastern and Central Europe.

It is this brutal action and the apparent attempt to extend this action to the remaining free nations of Europe that have created today's crisis in Europe.

The fall of the Czech Republic has shocked the entire civilized world. Pressure is now being applied to Finland, making the Scandinavian Peninsula precarious. Greece is under direct military attack by traitors, who are actively supported by communist-controlled neighboring countries. In Italy, a communist minority is desperately trying to control the country. Although the methods used vary, the pattern is very clear.

Amid this growing threat, there are now encouraging signs that the free nations of Europe are becoming more united for their economic well-being and the common defense of their freedom.

In the economic sphere, mutual aid efforts are underway to restore the conditions necessary to preserve free institutions. In Paris, the sixteen nations cooperating in the European Recovery Program are now meeting again, establishing a joint organization to work for the economic recovery of Western Europe.

The United States firmly supports these nations' efforts to repair the damage caused by the war and restore a healthy world economy. When I presented this plan to Congress last December, I emphasized the need for prompt action. Since that day, everything in Europe has clearly indicated the extreme urgency of taking such steps.

The Soviet Union and its satellite countries were invited to participate in the European Recovery Program. They refused this invitation. Moreover, they declared their fierce hostility to the program and attempted to undermine it with an aggressive posture. They see in this plan a major obstacle to achieving their attempt to subdue the free societies of Europe. They do not even want the sixteen cooperating nations to practice self-help.

The economic recovery of Europe is essential, but economic reconstruction measures alone are not enough. The free nations of Europe understand that if economic recovery is to succeed, some means of protection must be provided against domestic and foreign aggression. As the threats to their freedom have increased, a movement for collective self-defense has accompanied the movement for economic cooperation.

At this very moment as I speak to you, five nations of the free societies of Europe are signing a fifty-year agreement in Brussels for economic cooperation and joint defense against aggression.

This action is of great importance because this agreement was not imposed by a more powerful neighbor. It represents the choice of independent governments representing the will of the people and is being undertaken in accordance with the provisions stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations.

Its significance far outweighs the actual provisions of the agreement itself. It is an important step on Europe's path to unity in order to defend and preserve its civilization. This development deserves our full support. I believe that the United States will extend its support to free nations in appropriate ways as the situation requires. I believe that the determination of the free nations of Europe to protect themselves will be matched by our own determination to help them do so.

Recent developments in Europe have made us aware of many basic questions of great importance.

I believe we have reached the point where the position of the United States must be stated without error.

The principles and goals in the United Nations Charter still represent our hope for establishing law in international relations. This charter constitutes the international ethic. The basic form of discipline, and this international ethic is what our country believes in. But we cannot ignore the cruel fact that, due to the obstruction and even contempt of one country, this great dream has not yet been fully realized.

Therefore, we must take other measures to supplement the work of the United Nations and support its goals. In the history of the world, sometimes action is wiser than hesitation. Action, of course, contains certain risks, but the risk of inaction is greater. Because if we act wisely now, we will strengthen the United Nations and the forces of freedom, justice, and peace represented by all the free nations of the world.

Therefore, I consider it my responsibility to make recommendations to Congress, which, in my judgment, are best suited to support all free and democratic nations in Europe and improve the foundation of our own national strength.

First, I suggest that Congress swiftly complete its action on the European Recovery Program. This program is the foundation of our policy of aid to Europe. Its rapid passage is the most effective contribution we can make to peace.

The Senate's resolute action, regardless of political issues, is a remarkable example of the effective work of democracy.

Time is of great importance now. I am very excited to hear the news that the House plans to take swift action. I hope not a day will be wasted. Second, I suggest the swift enactment of legislation for universal military training.

Until the free nations of Europe regain their strength, and as long as the threat of communism to the survival of democracy persists, the United States must maintain sufficient strength to support those European nations threatened by communist control and police state rule.

I believe we have learned the importance of maintaining military strength to prevent war. We have discovered that if we want to maintain peace in peacetime, a sound military system is necessary. In the past, aggressors, seeing our apparent lack of military power, have unwisely precipitated wars. Although they were ultimately destroyed by misunderstanding our strength, we have paid a terrible price for being unprepared.

Universal military training is the only acceptable way to build up the civilian personnel of our armed forces to a level sufficient to meet emergencies. Our ability to mobilize a large number of trained personnel in times of emergency can prevent future conflicts, and this ability, combined with other measures of national policy, can restore stability to the world.

The United States' adoption of universal military training at this time will clearly demonstrate to the world our determination to support the will to seek peace with the strength to seek peace. I believe that the American people, through Congress, will decide to adopt universal military training, which is crucial to encouraging every free government in the world.

Third, I suggest the temporary re-enactment of conscription legislation to maintain adequate strength in our armed forces.

Our armed forces lack the personnel necessary to maintain adequate strength. Although the strength of the armed forces has been reduced to the minimum necessary to meet overseas obligations, far below the minimum it should be on the American mainland, our armed forces cannot maintain their proper strength through voluntary enlistment.

Unless we maintain our armed forces, we cannot fulfill our international responsibilities, such as maintaining our occupying forces in Germany until peace and stability are achieved in Europe.

There is no conflict between the need for conscription in the regular army and universal training in the reserves. Conscription is necessary until the foundation of universal training is laid, at which point conscription can be terminated and the regular army can be maintained on the basis of volunteers.

The proposals I have made represent the most urgent steps to achieve peace and prevent war.

We must be prepared to take all wise and necessary steps to achieve this great goal. This will require us to provide assistance to other countries. It will also require adequate and well-coordinated military strength. We must be prepared to pay the price of peace, or we can be sure that we will pay the price of war.

We in America remain determined to seek a just and honorable basis for resolving international disputes in every possible way. We will continue to be loyal to the United Nations and use it as the primary means of achieving international security based on law rather than force. We will always be ready and eager to cooperate with other nations—I repeat, with all nations—to achieve international understanding in every possible endeavor.

For the Soviet Union and any other country willing to cooperate sincerely to preserve peace, this door has never been closed, and it will not be closed in the future.

At the same time, we must not be confused about the central problem facing the world today.

The time has come when the free men and women of the world must bravely face the threats to their freedom.

The United States has a great responsibility to act for the welfare of the world based on our strength. We have learned that we must obtain the peace we seek through genuine effort and not through illusion, just as we fought for victory in war. At no time in our history has the unity of our people been more important than now.

To fully shoulder the tasks before us, unity of purpose, unity of effort, and unity of spirit are essential.

Everyone here today has a special responsibility. The situation in the world is so critical, and the responsibilities of this country are so great, that partisan strife cannot be allowed to diminish our influence in maintaining peace.

The American people have the right to assume that political issues will not affect our common work. They have the right to assume that in our efforts to maintain world peace, we will move forward hand in hand with all our might and without hesitation. With the help of God, we will succeed." (End)

### The City's Request to Reduce Conscription Quota Denied / Reasons for Deferment of Draftees Occur After Review / Applications for Supplementary Deferment Review Permitted

### Staff of British Tram Company Staged a Work Stoppage Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] Interior staff of the British Tram Company staged a "petition by work stoppage" yesterday morning.

[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haihu ship ran aground in the waters of Xia Dou, with a serious situation. The headquarters continuously dispatched ships for rescue, and various developments have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, according to reliable information from the company, the location where the Haihu ship ran aground is near Jinmen Island, where the previous Haizhe ship ran aground. In the past few days, the ship's power was cut off, and radio communication was lost, so there was no news. Now it is known that the situation has improved, and the Min 302 tugboat has arrived at the scene of the accident. The Xiamen branch has also dispatched multiple barges and is trying to unload the cargo in the cabin. Furthermore, the Jian Lun, which was transferred from Qingdao for rescue, has arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is scheduled to sail to Xiamen today to assist in the towing and rescue. According to Captain Fan Lun of the Jian Lun, if there is no change in the sea climate, the rescue work can be carried out smoothly.

Initially, the stern of the ship sank, and rescue seemed hopeless. Recently, the ship's body suddenly leveled, and there is a possibility of escaping the danger. However, this ship urgently needed to go to Xiamen to rescue the Haihu ship, so the insurance company that underwrote the Mingxing ship has hired technicians to try to rescue it.

### Next Month Allotted Rice Will Be American Rice; Rice Ration Coupons to Be Distributed on the 26th; Rice Market Should Employ Purchase Policies

[Our Reporter] The People's Food Allocation Committee of this city has decided that the rice ration coupons for April, which are sold based on population, will be sent to the district offices on March 25th and distributed by the 26th. It is hoped that all citizens will be able to receive their ration coupons by the end of the month. All the rice allotted next month will be American relief rice, and the quality is very good. The Allocation Committee is preparing to start delivering rice to various rice retailers on March 28th, starting with one-third, totaling 170,000 shih, before the end of the month. It is expected that citizens will be able to purchase the allotted rice with their coupons at the beginning of April.

[Our Reporter] Since the implementation of the comprehensive rice rationing in this city from March to date, the amount of rationed rice released from the warehouses has reached 350,000 shih. It is estimated that this figure accounts for about 50% of the city's total monthly demand for rice, which has greatly affected the rice sales in the market. The North and South Rice Markets specifically petitioned the People's Food Allocation Committee, claiming that the market has been sluggish in recent weeks, and prices have repeatedly fallen, even below the production area. This has led to a gradual decrease in arrivals. If this phenomenon continues, it will inevitably make the city's reserves even more empty. Therefore, they requested the People's Food Allocation Committee to implement a purchase policy, entrusting the management committees of the North and South Rice Markets to conduct the purchases on their behalf. This request will be submitted to the municipal meeting for discussion by Chairman Ren.

### Four Boxes of Contraband Goods Seized at Wusong Bus Station; Suspected of Being Transported to Communist-Controlled Areas

[Our Reporter] At around 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 11th, a car suddenly drove into the Wusong Wai Ma Lu Bus Station and unloaded four wooden boxes. A person stood beside them, looking like he was waiting for transshipment. Lou Qishui, a police officer on duty at the Wusong Police Station, went forward to ask what was in the boxes. He was told they were cigarettes, and the officer left. Glancing back, he saw that the man looked suspicious, so he turned back and interrogated him, and opened the boxes. As expected, he found a large number of cigarettes, and after removing the cigarette packaging, he discovered that they were all Western medicines and photographic materials. He took them all to the station. The man confessed that his name was Lin Zhigao, from Chongming, and that a friend had asked him to take the items to Chongming to sell. The station deemed the goods to be prohibited exports, fearing that they would flow into the communist-controlled areas, and immediately detained him. The case was then submitted to the Municipal Police Bureau for investigation the next day.

### Lan Chunchi Accused of Illegally Allocating Trucks; Supervisory Committee Member Zheng Zhongwu Testifies

[Our Reporter] Lan Chunchi, a former specialist committee member of the Executive Yuan, is accused of using his position to illegally allocate two new trucks to the "Fu-Pu-Xian Automobile Transportation Company" in Fujian. The case is under investigation by the District Procuratorate, which has sent a letter to the Fujian Provincial Government to investigate, but has not yet received a reply. The District Procuratorate summoned Zheng Zhongwu, the chairman of the "Fu-Pu-Xian Automobile Transportation Company," who is also a Supervisory Committee member and National Assembly representative, to testify. Zheng, who had passed through Shanghai from Min to Beijing to attend the National Assembly, reported to the District Procuratorate to testify. According to Zheng's testimony, he was the founder and chairman of the "Fu-Pu-Xian Automobile Transportation Company," which was later changed to the Putian Private Automobile Company. However, the company is now closed. During his tenure as chairman, he applied to the Executive Yuan for two trucks and sent employees Chen Qing and Lin Yimei to Shanghai to pick them up. He was not very clear about the details. Chen has now gone to Southeast Asia, and Lin is still in Putian, it is said. The prosecutor, seeking to clarify the truth, will summon Lin for questioning.

### Many Spring Outings; Railway Bureau Adds Trains on Sundays

Due to the large number of people going on spring outings, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus expect that passenger traffic on the two lines will be very crowded on Saturdays and Sundays. They recently decided to add a first-class reserved-seat car to the No. 72 special express train departing from Shanghai to Wuxi at 8:30 AM on Sunday mornings. This was trialed for the past two weeks, but most passengers still preferred to purchase tickets for the Triumph Express departing from Shanghai at 8:00 AM, resulting in the Triumph Express often being fully booked, while the No. 72 train, which departed half an hour later, was very empty. The Railway Bureau hopes that passengers traveling from Shanghai to Suzhou and Wuxi in the future can take the 8:30 AM special express train to avoid difficulties in purchasing tickets.

### Murder Conviction of Zhan Zhou Shi Who Killed Her Husband Overturned

### Shanxi Field and Grain Director, etc., Pass Through Shanghai to Beijing to Request Emergency Food Aid from the Central Government

[Our Reporter] The Shanxi Provincial Government, considering the serious food shortage in the province urgently in need of relief, dispatched Guan Minquan, Director of the Department of Construction, Geng Shi, Director of the Field and Grain Department, Liang Xianwu, Director of the Department of Social Affairs, Yin Yulan, Counselor of the Provincial Government, and He Defu, a member of the Provincial Assembly, yesterday from Ping by plane to Shanghai. They planned to take the train to Beijing that evening to visit the relevant authorities to present the real situation of the food shortage in Shanxi.

Allocation of 20,000 Tons of Grain to Be Transported in Seven Months

Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, they hosted reporters from various newspapers in the city on the fifth floor of the Bankers' Association. Geng Shi first reported the purpose of going to Beijing, saying: The food shortage in Shanxi Province is serious. Chairman Yan has previously telegraphed Chairman Chiang and Premier Zhang separately to request relief, and concrete solutions have been obtained. Therefore, this trip to Beijing is not in the nature of a petition. It is only intended to make a detailed presentation to the central government on the actual difficulties in local food supply. The Shanxi Provincial Government initially requested the central government to allocate 30,000 tons of food. Now, considering the actual situation, it plans to request the central government to allocate a minimum of 5,000 tons of relief grain and 5,000 tons of regulatory grain. In addition, it will request loans from the Four Joint Offices and ask the Ministry of Food to purchase 10,000 tons, totaling 20,000 tons. Using ten airplanes, operating twice a day, it will take about seven months to transport it. The Shanxi Provincial Government is currently investigating the amount of wild vegetables to be used as supplementary food. At the same time, it has implemented a food reduction program, distributing the food for four people to five people.

Each Bag of Flour Costs as Much as Six Million

He Defu then delivered a speech, saying: Currently, the communist army in Shanxi Province maintains a force of more than 100,000 troops, constantly harassing the area, and transportation has been cut off. Moreover, among the 3.6 million people in central Shanxi, more than 600,000 refugees have been forced to flee to safe areas due to the communist "locust policy". Furthermore, last year's drought was followed by floods, which is the biggest reason for the current food shortage in central Shanxi. Currently, each bag of flour in Taiyuan costs more than 6 million yuan, each dan of millet costs 11 million yuan, and each jin of sorghum costs 80,000 yuan, and there is nowhere to buy it. Previously, the Shanxi Provincial Government could exchange one piece of No. 3 coarse cloth for one dan and three dou and six sheng of wheat from the people, but now it is impossible to exchange even five dou. It is estimated that in the next three months, on average, 40% of the people in central Shanxi will not be able to obtain food. The situation has reached an extremely serious stage. Therefore, it is urged that the central government quickly allocate food and strengthen air transport to alleviate the urgent need. Otherwise, it is also proposed to request the central government to grant loans to purchase and transport food from the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan. At the same time, it is hoped that the public opinion circles will provide enthusiastic support. The reception ended at 5:30 PM.

### Wu Zhide Arrested for Defrauding Diamond Ring at Deda Hotel

[Our Reporter] Wu Zhide, 25 years old, from Suzhou, who runs a rice business, is staying in room 428 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel. At about 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, he went to the Central Market on Sichuan Road, holding a diamond ring worth about 15 million yuan and loudly offering it for sale. Many people gathered to watch. Soon, a swindler named Tong Shi'ren approached him, falsely claiming that the manager of the Deda Hotel wanted to buy it. He took the diamond ring to the entrance of the Deda Hotel and told Wu to wait for a moment. Unexpectedly, the swindler entered through the front door and exited through the back door, disappearing without a trace. More than half an hour later, Wu realized that he had been defrauded and went to the Huopu Police Station to report it. Li Yinmin, the section chief, ordered officers Ren Fengwu and Zhou Xueqin, the police chief, to wait in the area of the Central Market the next afternoon. They finally arrested the swindler Tong Shi'ren and brought him to the branch office, where he confessed to the fraud. It has been decided to submit the case to the District Procuratorate today for investigation.

### Price Fluctuation Statistics; Rice Rose the Least, Stocks Rose the Most

[Our Reporter] According to a survey by the Municipal People's Food Allocation Committee, the price fluctuations of various important commodities in the city from February 28th to the 16th of this month are listed for comparison. Bai Geng rose by 13.3%, Xian rice rose by 9.5%, 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 20.9%, Longtou fine cloth rose by 32.6%, Yongsha stocks rose by 68.4%, and Gubenzao soap rose by 12.9%. The person in charge of the Allocation Committee analyzed the above statistics, believing that the increase in the price of rice was the smallest, approximately equal to the black market interest rate, and Xian rice was even lower than the interest rate, which proves that the rice rationing policy has been effective. Due to the sluggish sales in the rice market, idle capital has been concentrated in stocks and other markets. Therefore, it is believed that suppressing prices requires coordinated efforts to achieve significant results.

The Enemy-Puppet Property Clearing Office previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to change the matters entrusted to the office for the execution of seizure and attachment of traitorous property to be handled by the judicial organs themselves. The Executive Yuan has now approved the implementation of this request, and the provisional measures previously formulated for the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui District and the Shanghai-Nanjing Municipal High Procuratorates to entrust the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui District Enemy-Puppet Property Handling Bureau to execute the seizure, confiscation, and disposal of traitorous property have been abolished.

### Forging Diplomas; Coincidence; Transferred to the District Procuratorate; Two Cases Require Investigation

[Our Reporter] Pan Huahui, from Pingjiang, Hunan, is currently training in the Aquatic Products Class of the Training Corps on Shuiding Road in this city. Last year, he applied to the Examination Yuan to participate in the county magistrate examination and submitted a graduation certificate from the Political Economy Department of Qunzhi Agricultural and Commercial College, signed by Principal He Jian and Dean of Academic Affairs Lu Zhaoqing.

The Examination Yuan suspected Pan of forging the diploma and sent a letter to the Judicial Administration Department to instruct the court in this city to investigate. The District Procuratorate summoned Pan for questioning the other day. He denied the forgery and claimed that He Jian knew about it.

Nurses and paramedics in the first aid station should aim to serve the citizens and win the praise of all sectors to bring glory to the police." Zhou, who is also the chief stationmaster, then gave a training speech to encourage them. The ceremony ended at 11:00 AM. There are currently ten service nurses and forty paramedic police officers.

### UNRRA's Sixty Fishing Vessels to Be Sold; Method Decided; Price Starts at US$30,000 Per Vessel; Those with Greater Wartime Losses Will Have Priority for Purchase

[Our Reporter] The Fisheries Management Office of the Custodial Committee of the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission has previously decided to sell 60 UNRRA fishing vessels to fishermen. The draft detailed sales measures have also been properly formulated by representatives of UNRRA and the Executive Yuan. It was submitted to the Executive Yuan at the beginning of this month, and sales can begin as soon as the Executive Yuan approves it.

According to reporters from relevant parties, the main points of the sales method are as follows: (1) The price of each fishing vessel ranges from US$30,000 to US$120,000, and the legal currency is paid according to the exchange rate of the Central Bank at the time of sale. If the purchaser cannot pay in one lump sum, in order to encourage fishery production, they may be allowed to pay in installments within five years. (2) Any legally registered fishery companies, fishermen, and fishery cooperatives are eligible to apply for purchase. Organizations with better equipment and greater wartime losses will have priority for purchase. (3) Applicants must be carefully reviewed by a committee jointly organized by the Fisheries Management Office, the Fisheries Association, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and only those who pass the examination will be allowed to purchase. It is also learned that to date, the number of applicants to purchase fishing vessels has exceeded 60. All 60 fishing vessels are currently stored at the Fisheries Management Office on Fuxing Island for sale and do not participate in work. Regarding the drivers of new-style fishing vessels, if future purchasers need them, they can also be hired. However, some fishing companies have already sent personnel to the training class there for training and can take up the work immediately after the fishing vessels are purchased.

In addition, the Fisheries Management Office currently has 127 fishing vessels. In addition to the 60 vessels sold and 10% (i.e., 12 vessels) dedicated to training, 50 vessels are retained for fishing and other purposes. However, because these vessels need to be repaired and refurbished successively, only 25 to 30 vessels are frequently used. The Fisheries Management Office plans to establish a company in conjunction with the semi-mechanical wooden boats made by themselves in accordance with the resolution of the Custodial Committee at this conference, and will set up branches in Qingdao, Wenzhou, Yulin, Taiwan and other places, but it is still in the planning stage.

### A Glimpse into the Lu Central Campaign

[Our Newspaper Jinan 15th Dispatched Telegram] The Communist bandits concentrated the only Ninth Column of the Bi Dong Field Army, and parts of the 13th and 14th Columns (to be verified) from southeastern Shandong and Jiaodong, plus four garrison brigades and four independent regiments, totaling about 50,000 men. Starting at midnight on the 10th of this month, they suddenly launched a pincer offensive towards Zhangdian, Zhoucun, Ganchuan, and Boshan in central Shandong, attempting to repeat their February Laiwu campaign tactics, to encircle and annihilate the National Army's field army. The development of the battle to the present has already proven that history will never repeat itself. Chen Yi's bandit troops' wishful thinking has clearly suffered a severe failure. The Communist bandits launching this pincer offensive were divided into three routes: One route took the Su Town east of Huantai as a base to attack Zhangdian, another took Lucun, the location of the Lu Central Military Region, as a base to attack Boshan, and the third route, which was the main force of the bandits, also took Su Town as a base, divided into groups to cross the Xiaofu River, and scurried to Zhoucun and Huantai.

On the Zhangdian front, the National Army only had one company, and the bandits used more than 4,000 men to encircle and fiercely attack. The National Army, facing a huge disparity in numbers, defended bitterly until noon on the 11th, and finally, due to running out of ammunition and having no reinforcements, the entire company heroically sacrificed themselves. More than 2,000 employees of the Zhangdian Office of the Jiaoji Railway made emergency arrangements when the situation became critical, and retreated westward. However, when they were advancing to the vicinity of Ma Shang Station, they encountered an ambush by the bandit army. Up to now, less than one-fifth have returned to Jinan. What is definitely known is that Engineer Fan Peilun has been captured by the Communist bandits.

The National Army on the Boshan front, due to its weak strength, in order to avoid being "defeated one by one" and "the large eating the small" by the bandits, Wang Yaowu ordered the defending troops, local militias, local Catholic personnel, and miners to all concentrate in Zichuan in an emergency. Zichuan received this support, and its strength doubled. Therefore, from the 11th to the morning of the 14th, Zichuan City and the Fan Hongshan Zibo Coal Mining Company were still in the hands of the National Army. The third route of the Communist bandits was to attack Zhoucun and Huantai, especially Zhoucun, which was their main target of attack. The reason is that this "largest village in the country" is the garrison of Zhou Qingxiang's Reorganized Division of the National Army. The war has been going on since the 11th until the evening of the 12th. In 48 hours, the Communist bandits fired cannons like rain, and launched six frontal assaults, suffering losses of at least more than 5,000 men. In order to achieve his strategic goals and avoid being "eaten," Wang Yaowu used his greatest wisdom to withdraw the entire division to the line north and south of Longshan Station, 33 kilometers east of Jinan City, within 12 hours, to defend the eastern gate of Jinan. Some people believe that the National Army's retreat of more than a hundred miles inevitably caused great suffering to the local people. In fact, if this plan was not adopted, not only might Zhou's troops have been "eaten up," but Jinan would have been even more critical. The reason is that the defense forces of Jinan at that time were unimaginably weak. This preserved the strength, leaving the Communist bandits "empty-handed." At the same time, it also stabilized Jinan City and its surrounding areas.

When the battle of Zhoucun developed to its climax, the Jinpu Railway near Sangnan Station, north of the Yellow River and only ten kilometers away from Jinan City, became tense. General Wang Yaowu used his highest wisdom and greatest perseverance to make the greatest use of this most limited force. The troops on the eastern route quickly relied on the deployment, and part of the troops on the southern route were also concentrated. The originally well-trained militias and volunteer police were fully utilized, making Jinan City a steel city that could not be opened or broken within 24 hours.

Although the collective southward migration of some wealthy merchants and the families of senior and mid-level officers in the pacification area once caused excitement, when they learned that this was Commander Wang's intention to allow his subordinates to have no worries and concentrate on the work of defending Jinan and Shandong, everyone became more calm and stable.

### The Possibility of Communist Bandits Invading Jinan is Extremely Low

What is currently lingering in the minds of the people of the country is whether the Communist bandits will follow up with a large-scale attack on Jinan? Regarding this question, the reporter's personal answer is that the possibility is very low. The main purposes of the Communist bandits' invasion of Zhoucun, Zhangdian, and other places this time are two: One is to try to use the large to eat the small and eat our Zhou Qingxiang's troops. The second is to try to attract the main force of the National Army to concentrate near Jinan, and then extensively destroy the Pujin section of the Jinpu Railway, especially Xupu, to expand their harassment offensive against northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui, and even threaten the safety of Pukou, so that the representatives attending the National Congress in the capital can hear the sound of artillery and taste a false alarm. If the Communist bandits had the intention of invading Jinan from the beginning, then while attacking Zhoucun and Zhangdian, at least three columns of bandits in southwestern Shandong should have gone north to cut off the central section of the Jinpu transportation in the area north and south of Dawenkou, in order to prevent the northward reinforcements of the National Army from the south. Then, the bandits on the eastern route in Zhoucun would join the bandits to invade Jinan. The Communist bandits did not do this, and they used too few troops this time. Therefore, this can easily help us understand that the Communist bandits have no intention of invading Jinan City on a large scale, at least for the time being.

Reviewing this Shandong campaign, the greatest success of the National Army is that the regular army did not suffer heavy losses. But on the contrary, the local militias rebuilt in Qidong, Huantai, Changshan, Zouping, Zhoucun, and other places failed to fully exert their due power. (Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Li Tian)

### New Recruits in Changshu Cause Trouble, Squad Leader Fires Gun to Suppress

Section Chief and Others Beaten, Six Culprits Captured

[Our Newspaper Changshu 17th Telegram] Conscription work here is in full swing. The original quota has been more than half filled. The troops from the army units dispatched to receive the new recruits have opened to Suzhou. There are still 254 new recruits in the conscription office. Bi Xinquan, the military section chief of the county government, went to inspect at around 8:00 PM on the 16th and suddenly saw new recruits gathered in several places, gambling with great excitement, shouting and yelling, and the order was chaotic. He immediately lectured them to obey discipline and ordered them to stop. Unexpectedly, Zhang Jinrong, a new recruit from Shiqiao Township, expressed dissatisfaction and uttered wild words. Section Chief Bi immediately ordered the guards to punish him. Unexpectedly, Zhang suddenly raised his fist and punched Section Chief Bi in the head. Fortunately, he leaned to the left and was only hit in the shoulder twice. At that time, the new recruits remaining in the office took the opportunity to riot. The manager, Zheng Jiong, was destroyed in the chaos, suffered chest injuries, and had difficulty breathing. He was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. The guards heard the alarm and, fearing that trouble would break out, immediately fired a shot into the air to show force. At the same time, they telegraphed County Magistrate Zhang. Zhang, the head of the Security Brigade, urgently assembled officers and soldiers from all brigades and rushed to suppress them. They first surrounded the location and then led troops inside to suppress them, and the situation calmed down. The main culprit, Zhang Jinrong, and accomplices Sun Guiting, Yuan Zhiquan, Mao Jihou, Zhao Guanfa, and Li Yi, were captured one after another. They were escorted to the county government that night and handed over to the military court for interrogation on the 17th.

### Rampaging in Northern Fujian for a Decade, Devouring More Than a Hundred Lives, Giant Tiger from Shunchang Transported to Fuzhou for Exhibition

[Our Newspaper Fuzhou 16th Telegram] In the subtropical areas of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, the breeding of animals and plants is rapid. Carnivorous beasts often easily mingle among them. Fujian Province is especially mountainous, and the mountains are full of wild grass and trees. Over the centuries, stories of wild beasts devouring people and tigers causing trouble have emerged endlessly. Among them, tigers are the most harmful. When people talk about tigers, they all change color. Whenever they hear of "tiger disasters," they often leave their hometowns and take their wives and children far away.

Regarding the distribution of such carnivores in Fujian Province, according to past discoveries and records, they are roughly divided into four categories: The first is the Wuyi Mountain range in northern Fujian, including Jianyang, Shuiji, Chongan, Pucheng, and five or six other counties. On average, there are more than ten tiger disasters every year. The second is the Yong'an, Datian, Youxi, and Shunchang counties in western Fujian, with about a hundred tiger disasters every year. The third is the Jinjiang, Yongchun, Dehua, and Xianyou counties in southern Fujian, with dozens of tiger disasters every year. The fourth is the Ningde, Pingnan, Zhouning, Shouning, and Zhenghe counties in eastern Fujian, with more than ten tiger disasters every year. Among them, the counties in northwestern Fujian are the most common, and the number of people and livestock devoured each year is also greater than in other places. These tigers, small ones "patrol alone," devouring people and livestock that are hidden. Large ones come in groups, knocking on doors and breaking into houses, capturing livestock and children one by one, and then roaring away. The sound of the tiger's roar shakes the mountains and mountains, those who hear it lose their courage, and those who see it are desolate. Therefore, the residents can do nothing about it. Sometimes, in the dark of night, they suddenly hear a tiger's roar, and in the blink of an eye, the tiger arrives, wanting to enter the door. Families often block the door and resist, knocking on utensils to cheer themselves on, hoping that the tiger will be frightened and return to its nest. Over time, people lose all confidence and often regard tigers as divine creatures. Whenever they hear a tiger warning, they burn incense day and night to pray for it to leave. The tragic situation in this is difficult to describe in detail.

The northwestern counties of Fujian Province all have tiger hunting organizations. The method is still to dig traps, install mechanisms, and lure tigers into the shells, then catch and kill them, taking the bones, joints, fat, and blood for medicine, and making tiger skins into clothing. However, in recent years, due to the people's lack of time and the fact that all civilian guns have been confiscated, tiger hunting is no longer possible. Generally new hunters each difficult get involved with mountain area, and launch a surprise attack after waiting. Therefore, in recent years, tiger disasters have tended to intensify. At the opening day of the Fujian Provincial Senate, three or four senators asked the police and security department to train their subordinates to fight tigers and requested that Lu Da add a tiger-fighting course. This humorous conversation was also triggered by this.

The Institute of Zoology and Botany of the Fujian Provincial Research Institute sent Technician Yang Yangyi to Shunchang in the early autumn of last year to collect specimens. Before long, Yang became known for hunting a famous giant tiger in Shunchang. The tiger has now been transported to the Fuzhou West Lake Products Exhibition Hall for public display. The reporter also visited the exhibition a few days ago. The tiger is installed in a glass tree, with a white forehead, hanging eyes, and sharp teeth facing each other. Its body is interspersed with yellow and white stripes, and its ferocious appearance is indescribable. It is about six feet long and more than three feet high, slightly larger than ordinary tigers. According to Wang Yingke, the director of the museum, the tiger has devoured no less than one hundred people in the Shunchang area, and the number of livestock devoured is not included. The eradication of this disaster not only made Shunchang County rejoice, but also made the counties in northern Fujian, which were worried about tiger disasters, happy. It is especially effective in clarifying the erroneous concept of the public "fearing tigers like gods." (Our Newspaper Reporter Huang Zhenqing)

### Burma Since Independence - Continued from Page Two

Generally speaking, Burma's current political situation seems to be still precarious. The current government claims to be left-leaning and strives to seek welfare for the common people, but its implementation is not thorough and is hampered. As a result, it fails to please both sides. The Communist Party is naturally active in secret, while right-leaning parties representing the interests of the landlord class, led by Ba Maw, the leader of the People's Party, are also eager to rise up. Furthermore, the ruling Socialist Party and the Volunteer Army themselves are not able to cooperate seamlessly. The press corps witnessed several major events during their stay in Rangoon, which offer a glimpse into the situation. One was the arrest of Red Flag Communist leader Thakin Soe in the city on March 12th. Documents seized from him revealed that the Red Flag Party was planning an uprising on March 20th to seize power. Secondly, after the war, Rangoon was filled with street vendors and shacks. The government initially did not interfere in order to please the poor, but later, under the attack and pressure of the landlord class, it ordered the demolition of shacks in a certain area of ​​the city center. This caused protests and petitions from the vendors. The Communist Party took the opportunity to incite them from behind, and the government had to arrest a number of people before the situation was resolved. Thirdly, more than 1,000 workers from the Burma Oil Company went on strike on the 9th, parading in the streets and shouting slogans in a line more than a mile long.

Strike Incident - The labor unrest had not been resolved by the time the press corps left Rangoon. As a result, gasoline was unavailable in Rangoon, and the black market price soared to four rupees per gallon (equivalent to about 400,000 yuan in US dollars), and it was still not easy to buy. The strike was triggered by the dismissal of a worker by a supervisor for spending too long in the toilet. In reality, such a small matter was not enough to justify a major strike, and there was obviously a more complex story behind it.

Destroying Newspaper Offices - Another incident was that on March 12th, members of the Socialist Party held a farmers' and workers' rally at the Shwedagon Pagoda. After the meeting, the crowd destroyed three newspaper offices: the Communist Party's "People's Voice," "Aung Bama," and the right-wing "Economic News." They beat and injured an editor of one of the newspapers and threw a Japanese-style hand grenade, but fortunately it did not explode. The reason for the destruction was that the three newspapers published news insulting Thakin Tin, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and one of the leaders of the Socialist Party, accusing him of raping a woman. The content roughly stated that Thakin Tin was on a tour of northern Burma and stayed at someone's house. The daughter of that person was the wife of a driver in the ministry. She had returned home after a quarrel with her husband. Thakin Tin said that he could take her back to Rangoon to reconcile with her husband, but unexpectedly, he raped the woman at a hotel on the way. The news contained obscene descriptions. The day after the news was published, members of the Socialist Party, led by the Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, destroyed the three newspaper offices. After the incident, Prime Minister Thakin Nu strongly emphasized the need to maintain law and order in a broadcast and declared that the rioters would be severely punished, but this showed that the upper-level members of the government could not control the lower-level cadres. After this series of events, a "gossip news" item was published in the newspaper on the 14th, stating that the government had issued a curfew and even prohibited groups of more than five people from walking in a row in the busy area near the city hall.

Ethnic Minorities - The issue of ethnic minorities has not been completely resolved in Burma. The ethnic minorities in Burma include the Shans, Kachins, Chins, Karens, and Mons. In order to achieve national unity, the Burmese have tried their best to win over these ethnic minorities. The constitution stipulates that they should be given full autonomy. The current president, Sao Shwe Thaik, is the chief of the Shan people. Although he has no actual power, it can be said that the Burmese have gone to great lengths to please the ethnic minorities. Even so, the Karen people are still demanding autonomy and refusing to participate in the general election. During the press corps's stay in Rangoon, they sent several representatives to Rangoon to negotiate with the government. The outcome is still unpredictable.

Wartime Losses - Burma suffered heavy losses during the war. Destroyed buildings can be seen everywhere in Rangoon. Rangoon University, which occupies 400 acres not far from the city center, has a quiet environment, but its internal facilities can be said to be empty. Most of the school buildings have traces of gray and black smoke on the walls, and the library's collection has been completely burned to ashes. Because it is too poor, it is not known when the post-war reconstruction work can begin. Since independence, the government has formulated a two-year agricultural production increase plan in order to complete the cultivation of 12 million acres of land. Originally, Burma's rice exports before the war reached 3.5 million tons per year, but after the war it was less than 1 million tons. They hope to increase it to 1.5 million tons this year. In addition to increasing production, the government has to greatly increase taxes in order to make up for fiscal revenue. As a result, prices have risen sharply, and the average standard of living has increased by three times compared to before the war. However, the living standards of most Burmese people are extremely low, and Burma is a rice-producing country, so according to their government officials, the lives of ordinary people should not have problems.

Current Cultural Situation - In terms of culture, more than 90% of adults are illiterate. There are more than 20 Burmese and English newspapers in Rangoon, but they are all substandard. The largest newspaper has a circulation of only more than 10,000 copies. Burmese journalists are not as nervous and hurried as those in Shanghai. They have a journalists' association, and most of the news is said to be delivered to their door by government officials. They also have a day off every Sunday, so on Monday, except for a "Monday Express" that is published only on that day, all the others are completely suspended.

In terms of foreign relations, the Burmese can be said to have no strong xenophobia, but because they have just gained independence, just like a young man who has just left the countryside, they inevitably have a naive mentality of pride and arrogance. This is an impression commonly felt by most overseas Chinese in Rangoon. To be honest, the press corps did not have a very good impression of Burma during their ten-day stay in Rangoon. However, this may be because we had too high expectations for this newly liberated country. Therefore, as a brotherly country, we still sincerely wish that this newborn baby can grow stronger day by day and gradually embark on the road to prosperity. (End)

### Two Tense Basketball Games: Qingbai Comes from Behind, Renyu Fights Valiantly but Fails, Qingbai Wins by Three Points Against Chenyou, Renyu Loses to Enkas by One Point

[Our Report] The 甲 League of the basketball league is nearing its end. The two games last night were unexpectedly tense. Qingbai came from behind to defeat Chenyou by three points with a score of 55-52. In the first half, Chenyou overwhelmed Qingbai with a score of 31-23. In the last minute, Qingbai, in a dangerous situation, won the victory through the efforts of Xu Heng, who can be called the hero of last night. Enkas showed their true colors in the second half to avenge their defeat, resulting in a score of 35-33, only two points ahead. Renyu performed extremely well, but the rainy weather caused few fans to attend.

Qingbai Narrowly Defeats Chenyou

In the first game between Chenyou and Qingbai, the situation within ten minutes seemed to be slightly in favor of Chenyou. Xu Heng scored a free throw, and Qingbai tied the score at twelve points. Afterwards, they competed fiercely, with the score fluctuating. However, Chenyou's style was aggressive. In the first half Chenyou overwhelmed Qingbai with a score of 31-23.

In the second half, Qingbai made personnel adjustments. Zhuo Guorong, Zhang Shaoqing, and Wang Junbing were replaced by Wang Nanzhen, Zhou Dayun, and Chen Xianglong, which showed some improvement. When the opponent added three points, Qingbai suddenly increased by eight points, making the score 34-31. Guorong missed an open shot, Shaoqing made a layup, making the score 35-35. The situation began to change. Aheng made four consecutive free throws, thus catching up with the opponent. Chenyou's Wang Bingfu tied the score at 41-41, and the battle situation fluctuated. In the last three and a half minutes, Qingbai was only leading by two points with a score of 48-46. Chenyou called a timeout. Later, Wang Bingfu became a lucky general, leading 51-50, surpassing Qingbai. Cai Yanxiong committed his fifth foul, Wang made another free throw, Dayun replaced him, Xu Heng's two throws and one penalty made the score 55-52, turning defeat into victory in the last minute.

Enkas Defeats Renyu

In the game between Enkas and Renyu, Renyu first broke the net with a free throw. Enkas scored three points in an instant, but Renyu actually surpassed them again with a score of 7-3. Zhong Yixin's performance was active, and the foreign soldiers were at a loss. This was maintained for fifteen minutes until Ge Pengqi, Gu Gu, and Bao Lai were rampant under the basket, only then did they raise their heads, catching up by one point to 13-12. The momentum changed, and Bao Lai scored another point. In the first half the score was tied at 17. Because both sides were closely marking each other, they both lacked scoring opportunities. In the early part of the second half, Shen Pengju scored a free throw, tying the score at 22. Queli committed a foul, and Shen's two free throws made another contribution, surpassing them by two points. When the score was tied at 24, Zhong committed his fifth foul and was replaced by Li Zhaohe, greatly reducing the team's strength. The foreign soldiers made repeated changes, with Ma Han Fulanke taking turns entering the game, making the score 28-24. Renyu called a timeout, but there was no turnaround. Ma Han scored twice, making the score 32-25. Sun Guozheng was ousted, and Chen Weiyuan replaced him. Wu Xinyun scored in mid-air, and Yao Wenyi scored three points from free throws, closely following behind with a score of 30-32. But time was running out, and Renyu lost to the foreign soldiers by one point with a score of 33-35, Enkas avenging their old hatred.

### Loan Measures Have Been Concretely Determined: Export Industry is Expected to Improve; Production, Transportation, and Sales Can All Receive Government Assistance

The issue of loans for export goods has been thoroughly discussed by all relevant parties and has been concretely determined. It is reported that, in addition to the discounting and packing loans for export goods, which national banks and bureaus will continue to handle as usual, they will also follow the recently approved fixed exchange settlement method for export goods by the Joint Treasury. This method is equivalent to mortgage loans. If an exporter has a transaction with a foreign importer, they can apply for a loan from a national bank or bureau with the order documents. The loan amount is limited to one-tenth of the foreign exchange value of the export goods. For example, if a foreign importer's order is worth US$1,000, the exporter can obtain a loan of US$100 from the national bank or bureau, which will be paid in national currency at the central bank's foreign exchange rate on that day. Exporters who obtain loans must export within a certain period. After the deadline, exporters must sell the export drafts to the lending bank or bureau to repay the loan. This method is more accurate and effective than general mortgage loans. In addition, with the discounting and packing loans, exporters can obtain government funding assistance during the production, transportation, and sales processes. There will definitely be no shortage of funds. Under these circumstances, the export industry is expected to improve in the future. Furthermore, after the implementation of the fixed exchange settlement method, if exporters do not fulfill the exchange settlement conditions, the lending bank or bureau may purchase the collateral.

### Enthusiasm in the Yarn Market: Cotton Cloth Implements Price Limits; Dragon Head Fine Cloth Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was spurred by the fact that the Textile Construction Company did not list prices several times, and the available chips in the market suddenly felt scarce. In addition, with the rise in cloth prices, people were even more enthusiastic. Customers from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions absorbed goods strongly, and manufacturers on this street also made advances. The pulling and lifting within and outside the industry became more intense, and the market continued to rise.

42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn immediately broke through the 190 million mark when it opened, and there were buyers willing to pay 95 million, and then it soared to 97 million. Later, due to the presence of police officers monitoring the scene, it returned to the opening price of 195 million yuan at the close. This was a surge of 18 million yuan compared to the previous day.

40-count and 32-count yarns of various grades also jumped by more than 10%. In addition, 21-count Double Horse spot yarn and warehouse receipts, as well as 20-count, 16-count, 10-count, and other yarns, all rose uniformly by varying amounts from 5-6 million to 11-12 million.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market situation was extremely chaotic. The Yarn Management Bureau, in order to prevent excessive fluctuations in cloth prices, decided yesterday to implement price limits on cotton cloth transactions, stipulating that the daily increase should not exceed 5% of the previous day's closing price, which has already been implemented. The number of transactions in the market was not high. Buying and selling shifted to the streets and alleys, and the number of transactions was now in a state of apparent scarcity and hidden prosperity.

When the market opened, asking prices increased steadily. Dragon Head fine cloth prices hovered around 3.77-3.78 million. Some floating accounts sold off slightly during the middle of the day. Later, around 10 o'clock, because the Textile Construction Company listed Silver Moon fine cloth at 3.54 million, which was about 100,000 yuan higher than the market price, and the Yuan Biji and Zhigong were still not included, people suddenly became excited, and buying picked up again. At the same time, credit conditions eased slightly, and customer groups replenished their stocks in large quantities. Floating shorts also began to absorb goods, and the market trend turned from fatigue to firmness. It was further heard that the supply of raw cotton was difficult, and rumors of yarn mills reducing production were prevalent, which further boosted people's morale, and the market continued to soar wildly. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth even exceeded the price limit, and there were buyers willing to pay as high as 3.88 million yuan. Outside the market, it was further bid up to 3.9 million, but there were no sellers, which was 130,000-140,000 yuan and 200,000-300,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Other cloths also rose significantly.

[Our Report] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual, selling a total of 16,950 bolts of cloth and 350 sheets. There were 571 applications, of which 40 were from manufacturers, purchasing 1,920 bolts of cloth. The remainder was purchased by various cloth shops.

Another report: Yesterday, the price of 23×23 Silver Moon fine cloth supplied by the Textile Construction Company was 3.54 million. There were many applicants, and the purchase permits were increased by 50,000 to 170,000 yuan. Until the end, it was heard that yarn prices had soared by more than 10%. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is expected to reach a high price of 4 million yuan again on the delivery date tomorrow. The price limit for Five Happiness fine cloth is 3.515 million yuan, but it was bid up to 3.68 million yuan outside the market, and there were still no suppliers, indicating a further jump is likely.

### Raw Cotton Exhaustion

Yesterday, the raw cotton market continued to rise. People in the industry unanimously looked at higher prices, and because yarn and cloth continued to rise and the source of origin was exhausted, asking prices were very high, and transactions were rare. It was said that Zhengzhou cotton was priced at 20 million yuan for delivery to the public warehouse, Shashi at 17.25 million, Huoji at 14.4 million, and Zhoupu seed cotton at 3.5-3.6 million.

### Rayon Firm, Silk Goods Rise

Yesterday, the rayon market was firm. 120-count Asahi brand glossy rayon opened slightly weaker in the morning, priced at 215 million yuan. Then, because various parties had a strong appetite, the market improved. By noon, the spot price was 200 million yuan, and the forward price was 240 million yuan. The afternoon was very stable, and it was once priced at 250 million yuan, but it was finally sold at 230 million yuan.

Factory-produced silk was slightly higher yesterday. Asking prices for five-load goods of various grades were all 5 million yuan higher than the previous day. The asking price for C-grade goods was around 320 million yuan, but there were no transactions. It appeared that high zero-grade transactions were around 305 million yuan, and the market for high zero-load lots was still around 260 million yuan. The silk goods market rose yesterday. Huaqiang Real Silk quilt covers opened at 156 million yuan and rose until the close of the market at 110 million yuan. Because raw materials were firm and expensive, and people were optimistic about the market, asking prices rose sharply. Dachang checkered Bi crepe closed at 428,000 yuan in the morning. The factory prices of other goods did not change much.

### Kerosene Rises Again

Yesterday, the kerosene market rose again because foreign exchange rates were higher and costs increased. Wholesale prices among dealers were also increased. High-grade barreled goods even rose to around 20 million yuan before they were available for sale. Mobil and Asiatic canned oil broke through the 2 million mark, reaching as high as 2.2 million yuan. Retail prices were 48,000 to 51,200 yuan per catty. The price limit was also adjusted, increasing from 25,000 to 33,000 yuan per catty, a sharp increase of more than 10%.

### Foreign Exchange Eases, Credit Conditions Loosen Slightly: Rice Prices Rose Again Yesterday, Flour, Oil, and Coarse Grains All Rose

[Our Report] The rice market stopped falling and rose yesterday due to the extension of foreign exchange rates, the change from tight to loose credit conditions, and the reported higher prices from producing areas. Prices of various grades all rose by more than 100,000 yuan.

Yesterday, 2,229 piculs arrived at the South City registration office and 3,864 piculs at the North City registration office. White glutinous rice was 3.45 million in the South City and 3.58 million in the North City. Thin indica rice was 3.45 million in the South City and 3.46 million in the North City. Early rice was 3.3 million in both the North and South Cities. Special glutinous rice was 3.6 million in the South City and 3.7 million in the North City.

Flour

Continued to rise slightly. Yesterday, credit conditions eased slightly, the North Gang absorbed goods, and the rise in rice prices also boosted morale, and many people replenished their stocks at low prices. Bingchuan and Laoche customer groups frequented the market, and transactions were more active. Bingchuan flour closed at 1.46 million yuan, and Laoche flour at 1.465 million yuan. Lilang yangfen has lacked transactions for a long time. Yesterday, 70 pounds opened at 2.08 million delivered. Although large-package wheat bran initially rose, it was flat at the close. The factory price of wheat was 2.15 million.

Coarse Grains

All rose in unison. After the rice price rebounded, coarse grains followed suit. Soybeans rose by 90,000 yuan. Corn was firm and soft, and opened 50,000 higher yesterday but weakened at the close. Red sorghum rose by 50,000-60,000, red beans rose by 100,000, and selected green beans rose slightly. Sesame customer groups returned to the market, rebounding by about 100,000. Raw peanuts were absorbed by the Guangdong Gang at low prices, rising sharply by 400,000 yuan.

Cooking Oil

Rose along with other commodities. The factory did not open prices. Soybean oil transactions were all recycled orders, with Dayou soybean oil being the most popular. It closed at 7.2 million yuan, an increase of 280,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The market had less raw oil inventory, and cargo owners held on even more strongly. Qingdao Jitu brand raw oil opened at 8.6 million yuan, an increase of 300,000 yuan. Raw sesame oil rose 300,000 along with raw oil. Soybean cake initially followed the firm trend of the previous day's close, rising by 20,000-30,000 yuan as both oil and soybeans rose. Later, a large number of recycled goods were released, slightly lowering the price, and ultimately rising by 20,000 yuan.

### Tea Market Remains Prosperous

The tea market trend remained exceptionally prosperous yesterday, and the rising wind spread, making it difficult to expect lower prices in the short term. Holders, seeing that inventories of various goods remained depleted, did not quell their hoarding intentions. The process ultimately led to a step-by-step increase in prices under these circumstances. However, transactions ultimately lacked full volume due to the failure to adjust the intake and output. According to industry insiders, tea sales have been quite strong recently. In particular, after foreign sales of green tea, the Xinhua and other tea companies in this city have a better appetite, but it is a pity that the supply is out of balance, making it difficult to satisfy the desires of those who seek it.

### China Trust Actively Promotes Frozen Egg Exports

The long-silent frozen egg export industry is now being actively promoted. It is estimated that within a month, China Trust Bureau can purchase 705 tons to be shipped to the UK, each ton worth £210. Based on the current price of fresh eggs at 4.9 million to 5 million yuan per municipal dan, with 25 dan making one ton of frozen eggs, plus considerable labor, electricity, packaging, and other costs, the person in charge of Mao Yu Company, a frozen egg company in this city, has recently contacted China Trust Bureau several times. They can accept the purchase price of 163 million yuan per ton offered by the Bureau, and a contract can be signed soon. China Trust Bureau believes that overseas market prices cannot be expected to be high, and even based on the recent foreign exchange calculation, the national treasury still needs to subsidize 10% of the losses.

### Taiwan Sugar Tight

Yesterday, the sugar market saw Taiwan sugar rise again because the exchange rate of Taiwan currency rose by another 7 yuan to 202 yuan. Spot goods: 24 group white was 4.92 million to 4.95 million yuan, up 250,000 yuan. Four-half white high goods were 5.1 million yuan, up 100,000 yuan. Taichung sand white was 4.42 million yuan, up 170,000 yuan.

The trading of warehouse receipts fluctuated greatly, with ups and downs of more than 200,000 yuan. The added payment for the 11th period was 1.1 million to 1.08 million yuan. The Saturday payment was initially 1.3 million yuan, once returning to 1.06 million yuan, and rising to 1.24 million yuan in the afternoon. 12th period coarse white was 1.25 million yuan, combined red was 1.04 million yuan, medium sand white was 1 million yuan, and four-half white was 1.33 million yuan. Taiwan sugar was sold as usual, with flower packages of four types: coarse white, cotton white, medium sand, and Taiwan red. The package prices remained unchanged from the previous period. Soil sugar was more sluggish in North sales, with a poor appetite. Transactions were sparse and the trend was soft. Shantou green was 3.1 million yuan, Xinghua white high was 4.6 million to 4.55 million yuan, Xinghua red high was 3.1 million yuan, Diaoqing was 2.95 million yuan, and Hainan red was 2.4 million yuan. Only 300 pieces were opened in total.

### Northern Coal Transportation Smooth

[Our Report] According to the person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee, the northern transportation channels are smooth, and coal transportation is gradually returning to normal, so there is no problem with the supply in this city. However, due to the smaller number of ships, there are currently 65,000 tons of coal in Huangqin Island and 28,000 tons in Keelung waiting to be transported, and they are currently trying to allocate ships.

### Chinese Stocks Weak in the Morning, Firm in the Afternoon: The Market is Expected to Rise Again

Chinese stocks were weak yesterday morning and firm in the afternoon. Jinglun and Hengfeng rose to the limit, and Yongsha was sold off by many parties. The previous market saw a tragic decline. Stimulated by Hong Kong Electric and Telecommunications, the market stirred again in the afternoon, but it was difficult to maintain, and the trend was vague.

The market opened slightly weaker in the morning. Yongsha opened at 1,765 yuan and 1,950 yuan for immediate delivery and forward delivery, respectively. It initially rose to 1,790 yuan and 1,960 yuan, then fell to 1,740 yuan and 1,920 yuan, and then pulled up to 1,775 yuan and 1,953 yuan. The spread for forward delivery was pulled higher and higher, retreating to 1,720 yuan and 1,910 yuan. No. 99 and other numbers were delivered, and No. 190 and others bought for immediate delivery, rising to 1,750 yuan and 1,945 yuan. This was because external funds stirred again. However, as prices soared, stock sellers were extremely anxious. There were more sellers than buyers, and maintenance was lacking. The decline was very sharp near noon. No. 235 and others sold for forward delivery, and No. 179 and others sold for immediate delivery in concert. Yongsha fell to low prices of 1,630 yuan and 1,850 yuan. The booming Jinglun, Xinhua, and Guohuo also returned from strong to flat. With the maintenance of No. 71 and others, Yongsha closed at 1,648 yuan and 1,875 yuan in the afternoon. Except for Jinglun rising by half a percentage point, Datong and Xinyi were flat, and Yonggong rose to the limit and then retreated, rising slightly, Zhabei, Huochai, Qinxing, Neiyi, Zhongfa fell by 10%, Jingfu, Xinguang, Zhongsheng, Shangwu, Xinhe, Meiya, Tongyi, and Yongsha fell by half a percentage point, and the rest fell slightly. Due to the premium relationship of forward delivery stocks, Yongsha rose by half a percentage point, Xinguang and Jingfu rose by 10%, and the rest rose slightly.

In the afternoon, Hong Kong Electric contracted further, and external stimulation became more intense. Yongsha opened and immediately rose to 1,720 yuan and 1,920 yuan. The forward delivery immediately rose from 1,910 yuan to 1,780 yuan and 1,970 yuan. No. 224 and others sold for immediate delivery, and No. 60 and others sold for forward delivery, retreating to 1,760 yuan and 1,943 yuan. Jinglun and Hengfeng rose to the limit. No. 9 and others bought for immediate delivery, No. 143 and others bought for forward delivery, and Ma Qingzhu first cited news from Europe. Yongsha rose to 1,810 yuan and 1,990 yuan. No. 105 and others sold for forward delivery, and No. 160 and others sold for immediate delivery. The National Bank made a difference and retreated, but No. 95 and others replenished and stabilized, No. 61 and others closed immediate delivery one after another, and No. 69 and others supplied forward delivery, and the market closed retreating to 1,775 yuan and 1,960 yuan. After the close, No. 190 and others continued to sell, continuing the downstream trend. As a result, compared to the morning close, the immediate delivery stocks Jinglun and Hengfeng rose to the limit, Yongsha, Zhabei, Xinhe, Xinguang, Yonggong, Zhongfu, Lian, Neiyi, Zhongfa, Guohuo, Xinhua, and Huaxin rose by half a percentage point, Qinxing rose by 10%, Datong fell slightly, Xinyi was flat, and the rest rose slightly. The forward delivery stock Xinhe rose by half a percentage point, and the rest rose slightly. The situation of unlisted stocks outside the market was stable. Zhonghua and Nanyang rose slightly.

### Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks Rose Slightly

Yesterday, the buying trend of government bonds tended to be mixed, with a transaction volume of about 4 million yuan. The open for the unified Class C bonds was 105,000, with a high of no more than 109,000 and a low of 104,000, and then stabilized slightly. Compared to the previous close, Class A, B, and D bonds each rose by 12,000, unified Class E was up 13,000, and unified Class C rose slightly by 2,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks were profitable yesterday. Hong Kong Electric reported a significant contraction, and the Guang Gang and foreign firm gangs all entered the market, with the securities gang closing out first. Yisha opened in the morning at 1.85 million and rose to a high of 1.97 million, and then retreated slightly. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha and Guanghang each rose by half a percentage point, the steel industry, reclamation, and rubber stocks were all flat, and the rest rose slightly.

### Tung Oil Price Increase

[Shenzhou News Agency] Regarding the purchasing price of tung oil this week, according to the China Trust Bureau, tung oil merchants in this city have raised the price per dan to about 7.8 million yuan due to the adjustment of the foreign exchange base price the day before yesterday (the 17th), which is improper. The China Trust Bureau's purchasing price this week will still be based on the original price of 6.5 million yuan. It is hoped that general oil merchants will recognize that the adjustment of the foreign exchange base price is to encourage exports and is not to raise domestic prices, and actively apply for purchases.

### Business Briefs

Recently, the fresh meat market has been exceptionally profitable. Yesterday, the price of fresh pork was 6.5 million to 8 million yuan per municipal dan. Retail leg meat was 100,500 yuan, lean meat was 115,000 yuan, and rib meat was 85,000 to 95,000 yuan.

Li Lixia, Director of the Shanghai Gold Management Bureau, has recently submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Finance due to the heavy responsibilities of executing financial control affairs in this city and because the National Bank will soon move to Beijing. He was originally the Director of the Audit Department and must move to Beijing to work.

New Medicine and New Drugs

### New Treatment for Post-Illness Limb Paralysis

— Liang Junqing

The progress of modern science is gradually tending towards seizing the power of creation and surpassing the ingenuity of nature. Leaving aside the ability of atomic bombs to destroy cities and annihilate the earth, and supersonic aircraft to travel thousands of miles in an instant, the astounding progress in medicine and its tangible benefits to mankind are even more incomparable to atomic bombs and the like. Although the killing power of new weapons such as atomic bombs has shocked the world and left people speechless, their use is limited to one place and one time, which is not as good as medicine that can be used daily to save people and benefit all mankind worldwide. Let me give a few examples to show how great modern medicine is in saving people. For example, diseases like pulmonary tuberculosis, laryngeal tuberculosis, and tuberculous meningitis (commonly known as infantile convulsions) killed countless millions of people in the past, and most doctors have always believed that there was no specific medicine to cure them. However, thanks to the invention of Streptomycin, incurable diseases have become absolutely treatable diseases. Furthermore, diseases such as pneumonia, plague, leukorrhea, syphilis, carbuncles, diabetes, rheumatism, and epidemic meningitis have also claimed the lives of countless millions of people in the past. However, thanks to the increasing progress of modern medicine, these various rare and complicated diseases are no longer a threat to humanity. In addition, conditions such as cerebral hemorrhage (stroke), vascular embolism, and angina pectoris in the elderly, which were previously considered incurable dangerous conditions, are now, although not considered absolutely curable, have their treatment principles fully elucidated, and many people have been cured. As for biological experiments on filterable viruses, cancer treatment, and other research, they are also becoming increasingly sophisticated and approaching the stage of success. From this perspective, the success of medicine in recent years is indeed the greatest among sciences.

Although the progress in medicine has already achieved astonishing results as described above, dedicated medical scientists, biologists, and others are still working tirelessly together, continuously conducting various astonishing and great experimental works in biology. According to recent medical reports, based on years of human biological experiments, it is gradually becoming clear the meaning of human cells in their biological life. In particular, there have been major discoveries regarding the respiration (Zellatmung) of human cell nuclei and cytoplasm. The respiration of the cell nuclei and cytoplasm throughout the human body is significantly related to human physiology, pathology, and the principles of human disease treatment methods. The driving and regulating forces are the three elements of human enzymes (Fermente), hormones (Hormong), and vitamins (Vitamine). According to the inference of the above-mentioned experts, the reasons for human birth, death, illness, and the various responses of external objects to the human body can all be thoroughly understood and used to seek methods of longevity.

Regardless of whether the above theory can become a reality, it has already achieved astonishing success in the research of respiratory enzymes in human cells. According to the report by Dr. Chazitseh of Vienna, Austria, the power of oxidizing enzymes (Oxydase), peroxidizing enzymes (Peroxydase), and catalase (Katalase) can be used to restore the limbs of stroke patients with paralysis and the limbs of children with infantile paralysis to full and normal activity in a very short period of time under certain circumstances. The principles of its treatment are described below:

In the past, doctors believed that the paralysis of limbs caused by diseases, such as the paralysis of infantile paralysis, the paralysis of multiple sclerosis (Multiple Sclerose), the paralysis after stroke, and the paralysis of spinal cord inflammation, were due to the complete destruction of the nerve center, making it impossible to treat. In fact, this is not the case. This dogmatic theory has ceased to exist due to the progress of modern medicine. If the nerve cells and their nerve centers in the patient's body have not been destroyed, they can be restored to their original function by using "enzyme preparations that promote cell respiration."

According to Dr. Chazitseh, there are two types of paralysis after illness: one is the paralysis phenomenon after the nerve cells and nerve centers mentioned above have been destroyed, and the other is the paralysis phenomenon caused by the nerve cells and nerve centers not being damaged, but only the enzyme regulation function having lost its effect. There is currently no method to treat the first type of paralysis mentioned above, while the second type of paralysis can be treated by applying enzyme ointments that "promote cell respiration" to the patient's skin, allowing it to restore its original function in the shortest period of time (often after a few minutes). This is because their nerve cells and nerve centers have not been damaged, but are only in a semi-anesthetized state where they cannot move. After being stimulated by the above-mentioned enzyme preparations, they can restore their mobility in the shortest period of time. This amazing new method of treating paralysis actually originated from the pathological tissue examination of Professor Prof. Marinescu of the University of Hungary, which is that "the respiratory enzymes (Oxydase) of the anterior horn nerve cells of the spinal cord are completely out of balance in those who have suffered from infantile paralysis, causing the limbs to which they belong to become paralyzed." Based on this experiment, Chazitseh continued to study and advocated the use of this enzyme therapy. After years of research by himself and clinical experiments by many scholars, great success has been achieved. Several examples are attached below:

(1) The four-year-old child of an American officer suffered from infantile paralysis two years ago. Afterwards, his left leg was completely paralyzed and he could not move. The muscles of his left hip were also paralyzed and atrophied, which was very obvious. Repeated treatments in the United States for the past two years were ineffective. So he came to Austria for treatment. After being treated with enzyme ointment 20 times, he was able to walk freely and play with other children. He could also go up and down stairs and jump.

(2) A twelve-year-old child suffered from infantile paralysis five years ago. Afterwards, the shoulder muscles were completely paralyzed and he could not raise his arm. After the first treatment with this method, he could raise his arm above his head.

(3) A fifteen-year-old girl suffered from infantile paralysis ten years ago. Afterwards, her legs were disabled and she could not walk at all. Most doctors believed that there was no hope of recovery. A re-examination before the implementation of this therapy also confirmed that her legs were disabled. Unexpectedly, after the first application of the ointment, her disabled right leg could perform knee flexion and extension movements. However, her left leg was still paralyzed as before. But after the second application of the ointment, the left leg could also perform free flexion and extension of the knee. After seventeen applications of the ointment, she was able to stand up and walk.

(4) A worker suffered from multiple sclerosis in 1933. Repeated treatments were ineffective. In 1939, he consulted a professor of neurology in Vienna, but he was considered to have no hope of recovery and was sent to a nursing home. In February 1941, he was treated with this ointment by a doctor and gradually recovered. In August of the same year, he felt energetic and able to return to work, so he requested to leave the hospital and return to work at that time. In September of the same year, he started to work as an assistant to an army doctor.

(5) A gentleman, 52 years old, had suffered from multiple sclerosis for eleven years, which had worsened in the past three years. He usually had to be supported by a nurse when walking. After the first application of this ointment, he saw immediate results and could walk freely without the need for a nurse.

In addition, it has also been proven to have rapid effects on patients with paralysis after stroke, paralysis of myelitis, and severe hearing loss. Due to space limitations, they will not be recorded in detail here. In summary, the invention of enzyme therapy is indeed good news for those suffering from paralysis. If it continues to develop in the future, its prospects will be even greater. Unfortunately, this medicine is a fresh glandular preparation, which must be prepared and used immediately and cannot be stored. We yellow-faced Chinese people are far away and cannot purchase it, so we can only look westward and eagerly await good news. Therefore, the author has already sent a letter to inquire about the manufacturing method, and the details will be revealed later. However, I sincerely hope that the patients in our country will not be disappointed.

### History of Inoculation

— Hua Xinren

The implementation of immunization methods began with "vaccination against smallpox." In this glorious historical record, we can discover the tortuous progress of "knowledge." At the same time, we should eternally praise the achievements of Edward Jenner, the inventor of this great method. In fact, "inoculation to prevent smallpox" has existed since ancient times. However, using scientific methods like Jenner to inoculate to prevent smallpox is unprecedented in history. We know that smallpox was prevalent in Europe in the 18th century, and people died everywhere. At that time, the only thing that medicine could do to help was to use "pus bubbles from smallpox patients to inject under the skin," which could make smallpox patients less severe. This method was called Inoculation. In Europe, this method was once popular and gained the faith of many people. In 1717, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the wife of the British Ambassador to Turkey, wrote a description: "Here, every year in mid-September, some old women specialize in inoculating others against smallpox. At that time, residents often notify each other; those who wish to be inoculated gather in groups of ten or so and ask the old woman to inoculate them. The old woman carries a small box containing smallpox pus. First, she asks the recipient where they want to have their vein punctured. After selecting the spot, she uses a needle to pierce the blood vessel and releases the smallpox pus into the punctured vein... not much pain. Eight days after inoculation, the person experiences alternating chills and fever, and about twenty or thirty smallpox pustules appear on the face. After recovery, no scars remain." Furthermore, according to the records of Dr. Maitland, a physician who strongly advocated inoculation at that time: Princess Caroline of England once asked King George I to pardon six prisoners sentenced to death, as long as they were willing to accept the experiment, they would be released. In 1721, Dr. Maitland boldly conducted this experiment. The results were satisfactory, and the six prisoners were pardoned. In 1774, King Louis XIV of France even accepted this experiment himself and did not experience any adverse reactions. Mademoiselle Rose Bertin, the hat maker for Louis' daughter, Marie Antoinette, even made a women's hat in the form of smallpox pustules to commemorate the King's great contribution. The royal family and nobles enthusiastically accepted the "smallpox inoculation method." Of course, the common people were particularly interested and hopeful, believing that there was a savior for the incurable disease of smallpox. Therefore, they were very enthusiastic about the inoculation method. Among those who excelled in this profession, Thomas Dimsdale was very fortunate at that time because he was not only technically excellent and proficient in dialects but also good at writing. The Russian King heard of his name and specially hired him to go to Moscow to provide guidance. Queen Catherine II first accepted inoculation as a model for the people. At the same time, she ordered her lover, Gregory Orlov, and Duke Paul to be inoculated, and the results were remarkable. From then on, not only must all members of the court follow suit, but even the remote rural areas followed suit in a panic. From these records, we know that the community had already been studying this issue before Jenner invented vaccination. At the same time, the community's awareness of "preventing smallpox" had already been established, but at that time, they only knew that it was so, but did not know why.

Once, it was rumored that the disease from smallpox transmitted from cows was much milder than that transmitted from humans. In particular, milkmaids spoke with certainty about this matter and exaggerated their words. Milkmaids had confirmed that smallpox from cows could be transmitted when milking, due to skin damage and contact with smallpox on the cow's body. Milkmaids were immune to smallpox in an intangible way. A milkmaid once told Jenner that Cowpox could prevent smallpox, and smallpox could not damage her beautiful face. Jenner was very interested and paid close attention to this issue. In 1796, Jenner began his experimental work. He took cowpox pus from the hand of Sarah Nelmes, a milkmaid, and inoculated it into the arm of an eight-year-old child, Philip. Philip became the first hero to contribute to scientific experiments. To commemorate this epoch-making scientific achievement, the famous Italian sculptor Montverde created a bronze statue to praise this eight-year-old child. The infinite horror and psychological fear revealed on the face of this first vaccinated patient tested by Jenner were truly vivid. At that time, Jenner did not have much confidence in doing this experimental work, but other than a pustule on his arm, like the cowpox we see today, Philip did not experience any pain. Three months later, Jenner conducted the second step of the experiment, injecting the poisonous substance from the smallpox pustule under Philip's skin again to test whether the efficacy of the vaccination was reliable. The result confirmed that vaccination could prevent smallpox. Based on these experimental results, Jenner completed a masterpiece in 1798, using a rigorous and upright attitude, insightful and decisive intelligence, and wrote a report entitled "For the investigation of the cause and effect of cowpox as it is called by the people of West England." Not only did it awaken people at that time to pay attention to preventive medicine, but it is also a model for us public health officials to strive for today.

After it spread to the United States, the first person to try Jenner's vaccination against smallpox was Benjamin Waterhouse, a professor at Harvard Medical School. In 1800, he vaccinated his seven children. Moreover, he also made them contact smallpox patients. Unexpectedly, these seven children did not contract smallpox. In 1802, Professor Waterhouse again inoculated nineteen children who had been vaccinated with the dirty smallpox virus under the skin. As a result, two children who had not been vaccinated contracted smallpox, while the other children were safe and sound. After this rigorous experiment, it was further proved that "cowpox is a reliable bodyguard against smallpox" (borrowed from the slogan of the Boston Health Bureau). In 1805, the shrewd and capable General Napoleon ordered the three armies to be vaccinated. This was an indication that the efficiency of promoting the invention of vaccination was faster than any other new medical invention. Unfortunately, due to the slow development of science at that time, the opposition still had great potential. Among them, the people in the church opposed it most fiercely. The excuse for their opposition was that this kind of work violated God's will. The opposition even used the propaganda that people would acquire bovine characteristics after vaccination. But facts speak louder than words, and scientific work won the final victory.

According to the May 1947 issue of Life magazine in the United States: In March, a tourist from Mexico City suddenly died of illness in a hotel in New York City. It was later confirmed to be smallpox. The city's health bureau was shocked upon hearing the report, fearing its spread. Mayor Dewey ordered the city's 175,000 wartime air raid warning agencies to issue alarms. The citizens initially thought a great disaster was coming when they heard the alarm. After the reason was announced, collective vaccination locations were designated, and universal vaccination was implemented. In total, 500,000 people were vaccinated in New York City every day. Within four days, it reached 2 million people. Ten days after this incident, the health authorities were relieved because no new cases were found. If this incident happened in Shanghai, I think the mayor and the director of the health bureau would not have been so "frightened." Because smallpox is a common epidemic in our country.

We must admit that since the invention of vaccination, although smallpox has not yet been eradicated, at the very least, we can say that smallpox is not an incurable disease and can be prevented. Therefore, Jenner's achievements are eternally immortal, just as US President Jefferson said in a letter to Jenner in 1806: "Future generations will know from reading history that the most annoying smallpox since ancient times has been eradicated by you, and now there is no one left." Following this example, up to now, we should make efforts to promote vaccination diligently and seriously. But, even if the words are unobstructed, it is still not without obstacles; otherwise, I will vaccinate myself, and smallpox will still be prevalent, what else is there to say!

Junqing's note: Mr. Hua's article describes the support of Europeans and Americans for vaccination, which is truly inspiring. At present, internal strife is frequent, and smallpox is rampant. Even in Shanghai, smallpox is very rampant. Not only does the authorities not have more complete methods to prevent it, but the general public also has a general attitude of indifference. Alas, "If the people do not fear death, why threaten them with death?" Do the people really not know to fear death? It is only that living is worse than death, so they have no time to fear death. Alas!

### Q&A on Medical Affairs from Colleagues

— Edited by Liang Junqing

(1) Treatment Methods for Dysmenorrhea

Dr. Zhang asked: There is a 41-year-old woman who has suffered from dysmenorrhea for four years. Every time her period comes, she has back pain, lower abdominal pain, sometimes heavy bleeding, sometimes light bleeding, dark purple color, and lots of leukorrhea. After examination, it was found that there were many cysts on the cervix and mild inflammation, which seemed to be a type of membranous dysmenorrhea. Now, I would like to ask what methods can be used for treatment. Is it possible to use X-rays to destroy the ovaries? Or should a uterine scraping operation be performed?

Dr. Wang replied: The symptoms described in the letter are not very detailed, so I cannot give a definitive answer. However, menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and tumors of the uterine adnexa can all occur due to uterine inflammation, and this type of inflammation is mostly tuberculous. According to recent research by many gynecological experts, there are many cases of tuberculosis in the uterus and its adnexa (which is closely related to female infertility), which has not been paid attention to in the past. In addition, the symptoms described in the letter can also occur due to endometritis or perimetritis (which, of course, can also be caused by salpingitis or oophoritis). If you can check the patient's medical history and blood test report (such as the amount of white blood cells, the classification of white blood cells, and the Waaler-Rose test results), as well as the body temperature before and after menstruation, you can determine the nature of the cause of the symptoms. If it is a non-inflammatory uterine adnexal enlargement, it can be removed. The excised material can also be examined histologically. As for the method of uterine scraping, it may not be appropriate, as there may be inflammation present, which may lead to a negative result. Moreover, even if the patient has a state of endometrial tissue hyperplasia and grows in other parts (Endometrio is), uterine scraping will not be effective. Where possible, it is best not to use X-rays to destroy the ovaries, to avoid many negative consequences. However, if there is the aforementioned Endometriosis, then this method can certainly be applied, as this disease is extremely difficult to treat, and even if it is surgically removed, it is not easy to succeed.

(2) Methods to Promote Hair Growth

Dr. Chen asked: Are there any methods to make hair that has fallen out grow back?

Dr. Ma replied: According to recent research results, there is still no reliable and effective hair growth medicine. Twenty years ago, there was a hair growth medicine in Germany called Humagsolan, which was once popular, but then became dormant due to its unreliable effectiveness. Recently, the Swiss Roche pharmaceutical factory has advertised heavily, praising its hair growth medicine "Pintin" as a hair growth vitamin, containing pantothenic acid, namely vitamin B derivatives, which can turn gray hair black, regenerate hair loss, and is based on various chemical tests and clinical reports. Of course, this kind of hair growth element based on vitamins has its theoretical value, but according to personal clinical experiments, its effect is not very obvious. It seems to be far from ideal and still needs to be researched. As for the early stage of baldness, it is hereditary. If it is a general hair loss, it is related to endocrine disorders (namely, the common people call it kidney deficiency), and seborrhea (Seborrhoe) in the scalp is also very relevant. Ultraviolet irradiation of the scalp seems to have a hair growth effect, but its success is very small and it does not last long before the hair falls out again. I think that if the seborrhea of the scalp can be cured, many hair loss situations can be improved except for hereditary ones. As for taking arsenic preparations internally, I have not seen it be effective.

(3) Treatment for Seborrhea of the Face

Dr. He asked: During clinical consultations, young people often come to ask about the cause and treatment of seborrhea of the face. I knew it at the medical school but not in detail, so the treatment was sometimes effective and sometimes not. I wonder if modern medicine has progressed and there are newer theories and treatments?

Dr. Wang replied: Seborrhea of the face is only a local phenomenon. It can also occur in the scalp, ears, neck, and chest. The causes are very complicated. Some are caused by excessive sebum secretion, some are caused by endocrine disorders, some are caused by metabolic disorders in the body, some are caused by abnormal food intake (such as eating too much oily food or eating too much chocolate candy), and some are caused by Flaschenbacillus, etc., all of which are direct or indirect causes. Seborrhea of the face often occurs in conjunction with acne, which must be known. The treatment is best with X-ray irradiation, but it must be performed by an expert and started with the smallest amount. If the dose is too high, it can destroy the main tissues of the skin and cause great harm. Some predecessors used endocrine hormone therapy and saw results. However, the required dose varies from person to person, which is very difficult to measure. Some doctors often fail to obtain the effect due to inaccurate dosage, so they abandon it and do not use it. If the patient has a cause of abnormal food intake, then the treatment must, of course, start from controlling the diet. Sometimes using artificial sun lamps or ultraviolet irradiation is also very effective. As for the local aspect, applying 1-3% salicylic acid preparations or 2% sulfur preparations (such as aqueous solutions, powders, or ointments) may be helpful.

### Fan Shouyuan Elected as National Assembly Delegate

— Editor

The news of Dr. Fan Shouyuan, a stalwart in our medical community, successfully running for National Assembly delegate has been officially announced in the newspapers in the past few days. This is something we should celebrate. Because Dr. Fan has selflessly dedicated himself to our medical association for the past two years, making his greatest efforts. He has connected the feelings of our medical community, bridged the gaps within our medical community, tried to develop the affairs of the medical association, and strived to eliminate disputes among members. He also used his position as a city councilor to fight for the rights and interests of our doctors in the City Council. How could someone who seeks the welfare of the public without shirking hardship and resentment not be supported by us? Therefore, he received the most votes in this election for representatives to the National Assembly. This is truly what everyone expected. Now that he has been formally elected as a National Assembly delegate, he will certainly continue to use his extraordinary talent in his position as before. This does not need any further addition from us. Well done, Dr. Fan! We celebrate your success, which is also the success of our medical community.

### Random Thoughts

— Pingzhai

Before the war, a ten-dollar bill could buy a picul of rice. Now, no one would even pick it up if it were dropped on the ground. If you used a ten-dollar bill to light a cigarette, it would probably be cheaper than using a match.

A few days ago, when I hailed a rickshaw, I saw a thousand-dollar bill on the seat cushion. I told the rickshaw puller that there was money on the seat. Four or five rickshaw pullers standing nearby all gathered around to look. When they saw it was only a thousand dollars, they all burst into laughter. In the end, the rickshaw puller I hailed stuffed it into his pocket, but I heard his companions making fun of him: "What a disgrace!" "What a big appetite!"

It seems that picking up a thousand-dollar bill is already an "embarrassing" thing.

At the same time, everyone taking the tram feels the trouble of making change, especially now that there is a one-level fare of six thousand yuan. Both passengers and ticket sellers feel a headache. It is certainly not acceptable for passengers to pay five thousand yuan, as that would be "cheating," and the ticket seller would definitely not be polite. But if you pay ten thousand yuan and ask for change, the ticket seller often does not have that many one-thousand-yuan bills. As a result, most people naturally accept the ten thousand yuan, give you a six-thousand-yuan ticket, and say "Thank you!" Many passengers do not care about the four thousand yuan change anyway, and gradually become accustomed to it.

However, some passengers feel that they have been taken advantage of, or that regardless of how small the matter is, it violates the principle of integrity, and they inevitably argue. This usually begins with the passenger's face turning red and ends with the ticket seller's sarcastic remarks.

Thus, every Shanghainese feels a kind of contradiction: when going to the bank to withdraw money, they fear that the bank will give them "bad bills." If you want to withdraw ten million, and they give you bills with a face value of only five thousand yuan, you may already feel impatient. If they give you bills of one thousand yuan or even five hundred yuan, then no matter how good your usual self-cultivation is, you cannot help but lose your temper and say that the bank clerk is deliberately working against you. When receiving money, for the sake of convenience, the face value of the bills is feared to be too small, and the bills are feared not to be new enough. But on the tram, you fear that your pockets are full of brand-new five-thousand-yuan Customs Gold Unit bills, because making change takes time, and sometimes it will cause you to miss your stop.

I have a classmate named Li, who studies literature and has a particularly rich imagination. He often likes to fantasize about the history of those tattered banknotes. He often says: "Maybe this bill was once held by a beggar covered in sores; maybe it has been in the hands of someone with leprosy... How terrible, how terrible!" So he always keeps an empty glass bottle containing aspirin pills with him, and the surface of his clothes is full of alcohol. Whenever he inevitably receives a slightly worn banknote, he always pours a little alcohol into his palm and quickly rubs the fingers that touched the banknote in the alcohol, saying it is "disinfecting." However, he always carries some of those small bills that he considers terrible, because he hates wasting time. Whether buying things or buying tram tickets, whenever there is a fraction, he must make it up to the exact amount, and then happily leave.

In fact, customers like Mr. Li are certainly welcomed by all stores or honest ticket sellers, because they are straightforward and the transaction is done smoothly. However, there are probably not many people like Mr. Li in the world, especially in Shanghai, there is probably only him alone. Thus, the problem of making change, a problem for most Shanghainese today, remains unresolved.

But the headache of the change problem is not unique to China. Foreign countries also have it, and this "foreign country" is actually the most opulent America.

In the few years after 1860, America experienced a major shortage of change. Various companies and businesses automatically manufactured some "token coins" (which were coins, not the "token vouchers" that appeared in wartime Shanghai). The company's brand name and address were printed on the token coins, and the other side was printed with words such as "a loaf of bread" or "a bottle of beer." More than ten thousand stores used these "token coins," and at least twenty-five million "token coins" were in circulation. But in 1864, the owner of a bar in New York actually refused to redeem them after issuing twenty thousand beer token coins! As a result, the owner was of course arrested, and the American government also promulgated a law prohibiting private minting of any currency. "Token coins" then disappeared and became a historical term.

But what really solved America's change shortage was not any legal force, but the American government's complete overhaul of the issuance amount of coins. When there are more "dimes," making change is no longer a problem.

Perhaps it is still too early to talk about reforming the currency system today, but if we are not reforming, then when we do reform, we should really let our pockets often hear the clinking sound of "dimes" colliding.

### The Greatness of the World

The largest fish caught by a fisherman with a fishing rod was a great white shark caught by Australian Cal Howell on May 12, 1941. This shark was fourteen feet eight inches long, with a girth of eight feet and a half inch, and weighed one thousand nine hundred and nineteen pounds.

The strangest record in the United States was recorded by a black jazz musician named Pechitol, who played six different instruments at the same time: one soprano saxophone, one baritone saxophone, one trumpet, one piano, one cello, and drums. During the recording, the music for the first instrument was recorded first, and after it was finished, the music for the second instrument was recorded on the same record, continuing six times in a row. The name of this piece of music is "Priest."

When Westerners drink different kinds of wine, connoisseurs use different wine glasses. Therefore, first-class restaurants and hotels must have at least sixty sets of wine glasses of different shapes and sizes.

Although the facilities in American prisons are good, prison breaks still occur frequently. Previously, prison guards were often not punished when prisoners escaped. Recently, the United States Congress passed a law that when a prison break occurs, the prison guard should be convicted of dereliction of duty, fined five hundred US dollars, and sentenced to one year in prison.

### Old Stories of Peking University

— Jiefu

I recently read an article in the "Free Discussion" section of the Shen Bao written by Ling Xiaohange, "Friends of My School," discussing the past of Peking University. It is truly comforting to learn some details from this, as I have not heard from old friends for decades. I was in the same class as Ling Xiaohange. I have been working in the engineering field and sometimes feel happy enough to pick up a pen and publish articles. My old friend probably still remembers the name "Jiefu" from the early Republic of China. When we talk about the past of "Peking University" today, it is like a white-haired palace woman of the Tang Dynasty talking about the relics of the Tianbao era. Ling Xiaohange's account still has omissions, so I will add one to respond and inform the alumni of Peking University.

When the Qing Dynasty first established Peking University, it set up four departments: Shixueguan (Literary Study Hall), Jinshiguan (Scholars' Hall), Shifanguan (Teachers' Hall), and Yixueguan (Translation Hall). The first two halls were set up for those who passed the imperial examinations to make up for their lack of modern learning. Mr. Ye Yu-fu (Gongchuo) was a student of Shixueguan, and Mr. Guan Ying-ren (Genglin) was a student of Jinshiguan. Shifanguan was set up to prepare teachers for establishing schools, and Yixueguan was to cultivate talents for translating Western books. Yixueguan had many handsome young men, and was known as the "Xianggong Tangzi" (Elegant Gentlemen's Hall) at the time. Wu Jinglian, the speaker of the first National Assembly of our country, and Zhu Zhaoxin, the former special envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, were both students of Shifanguan. Mr. Gu Mengyu was a student of Yixueguan. There were many others who held important positions or were well-known at the time. These are just a few examples casually mentioned. Later, in preparation for establishing a university with specialized departments, a university preparatory course was first set up, and students were recruited from various provinces and sent to Beijing to study. I was one of the twenty-four preparatory students from Guangdong Province at that time. At that time, there were very few talents in modern learning in the country, so most of the professors in other subjects besides Chinese Studies were foreign, from England, America, Germany, France, Russia, Belgium, Japan, and the Netherlands. It could almost be called an international school.

The head of the university was not initially called the president, but the "University Superintendent," with the rank of a third-grade Beijing official concurrently serving in the position. The position was quite high, and those who held this position were all well-known figures. I remember that Mr. Yan Jidao (Fu) once held this position. Yan had a foot ailment. Every time he arrived at the school, he got out of the car at the gate and then rode in a two-person sedan chair to the superintendent's office. He also smoked opium. The students criticized him for being old and corrupt, and created a cartoon of someone smoking opium, published in the newspaper, titled "Smoke Recovery." Yan was embarrassed and soon resigned. He was succeeded by Mr. Ma Xiangbo (Liang), who was nearly eighty years old at the time. The students thought he was too old, and sent several representatives to see him, telling him: "Peking University is not easy to run. Mr. Yan has already retreated because he found it difficult. You are so old, why bother looking for trouble? Wouldn't it be better to rest at home? If it's for the monthly salary of three hundred yuan, that's easy to solve. We students can pool three hundred yuan a month and send it to you!" Old Mr. Ma laughed and said repeatedly: "Bring it to me! Bring it to me!" Ma was quite humorous and eloquent. The next day, he summoned the students for a speech, saying: "What is called a university is not because the school's buildings are big, the students' tempers are big, or the principal's age is big (what else is big, I don't remember clearly), but it is because of how it should be to be worthy of being called a university," and so on. But Mr. Ma did not stay in his position for long, resigning after a few months, which shows that the sharpness of Peking University students did not begin with the May Fourth Movement.

### Lincoln Polishing His Shoes

— Gonghua

One morning in the White House.

Secretary of State Jim was led by a messenger to a large living room to see President Lincoln on official business. As he walked down the corridor, he saw a man beside him who was constantly polishing his shoes. Jim inadvertently looked down and stopped in surprise.

President Lincoln was constantly polishing his own shoes.

"Your Excellency, as President, doing such a thing is not very elegant when seen by others, especially by noble ladies..." Secretary Jim usually heard people say behind his back that the President often showed crude manners like a country bumpkin, and he blurted it out today.

Then Lincoln smiled and looked at Jim's surprised eyes; "Ah! Is polishing shoes a shameful thing? Mr. Jim! That is not right. The President and the shoe polisher are both public servants working for the world. There should be no lowly occupations in the world, only people with base hearts."

Lincoln said loudly, and with hands still stained with shoe polish and other smells, he took the important official documents brought by Jim and began to read them with the same enthusiasm as when he was polishing his shoes.

### Anecdotes of Einstein

— Leng Leng

The father of the theory of relativity, Einstein, was slow, shy, and spoke incoherently as a child. His parents worried that his talent was not as good as ordinary children, and the teachers in school shook their heads in despair, calling him a dunce and thinking that he was hopeless and uneducable. Who knew that such an incredibly clumsy child would be recognized as one of the most outstanding intelligent giants of our time, one of the greatest thinkers of ancient and modern times, sixty years later?

Einstein regarded fame, wealth, and luxury with extraordinary indifference; it is said that once, the captain of a ship on the Atlantic Ocean, in order to treat Einstein well, specially gave up the most exquisite room on the ship to wait for him, but he was severely rejected, unwilling to accept this special treatment, and preferred to sleep in the lowest-class steerage. When he was hired by Princeton University in New York, USA, to go to lecture, in order to avoid the trouble of interviews with reporters, he instructed his friends in advance to secretly pick him up by barge halfway before the ship arrived at the port and transfer him to a car to drive to the school.

Currently, at least nine hundred books have been published explaining Einstein's theory of relativity, but according to Einstein himself, only twelve people in the world can truly understand his theory of relativity, and his wife is also an exception.

Einstein once used a simple example to explain relativity; a beautiful girl sits with you for an hour, and you feel like it is only a minute; if you sit alone by the stove for a minute, you feel like it is an hour. - At first, it seems to make some sense, but it is actually relativity.

According to Einstein's wife: her husband is very willing to abide by order in his thoughts, but in real life, he is willing to adopt casualism, unwilling to be bound by order, and wants to do whatever he wants to do whenever he wants to do it. He has set two rules for himself; one is that no matter what "rules" are, he does not want them, and the other is that he is not controlled by anyone's opinions.

But sometimes he has to violate the second rule when he meets his wife; for example, when she invites friends to a tea party at home, she wants to ask her husband to participate in their grand meeting, but Einstein often answers harshly: "No! No! I can't go! I can't go! I can't stand such harassment, which makes me unable to work in peace, I want to leave this place immediately!"

Einstein's wife is really patient, waiting for him to finish his anger, and then uses a few good words to make him obediently follow her downstairs to participate in their tea party.

Einstein's daily life is very simple. He usually wears a set of untidy old clothes, does not like to wear a hat often, and often whistles or hums songs in the bathroom. Although he intends to solve the complicated mysteries of the universe, he believes that he cannot make the enjoyment of life too complicated, so when he shaves after bathing, he does not use shaving soap but uses bath soap, because he thinks two kinds of soap is really a waste.

There are really many anecdotes about Einstein, let me tell one more to end it! One day, he argued with a ticket seller on a bus in Berlin, because he thought the change was wrong. After the ticket seller recounted the change, he realized that Einstein himself was wrong, so he returned the change to him and said a humorous sentence that was almost mocking our great mathematician and thinker: "This time the mistake is because the gentleman cannot count!"

### Poetry Record of the Sea Red Mansion

— Xu Banmeng

Sending to a Friend

After parting, the border river is urged by horns, the frost wind is bleak and tight on the night of the stage, the three lives of the mind are thousands of folds of clouds, ten thousand miles of home mountains are a cup of wine. Laughing at the fish and dragons working on acrobatics, leisurely inviting apes and cranes out of the dust, old friends are scattered and few confidants, and the flames of war are everywhere.

Receiving a Friend's Letter and Sending Back

Where do you want to go in all directions, how long will you invite me to drink painfully, heroes on the sea leave the ramparts, elders in Jiangdong look forward to banners; rivers and mountains return me to the divine state, singing and crying follow people, the country's destiny moves, how many new tears of Bao Xu, where to find the bells and instruments in the southern accent!

Drunk

Who lined up the sky howling on the high platform, ten thousand miles of clouds and rainbows are extremely sad, a good head is thrown in one lonely bet, the ruthless universe is old and ash! Hardship is the blessing of mediocrity, destruction is also the talent of construction, alas, my life is over, I lie drunk in the Artemisia.

Intending to Return, Composed Orally

The river flows east, the sea sun sets west, the scenery of Jingnan is unbearable, the dream of returning home is gradually distant and faint, listening to the cuckoos crying year after year.

### The Collector's Seal

—

"Collecting" is considered the most sympathetic of all hobbies. Books, paintings, card versions, bronzes, porcelains, everything enriches knowledge, broadens horizons, and nourishes the spirit, which is more brilliant than wild dancing, gambling, and the plays of eroticism, pornography, blacklists and whitelists. However, it also requires a kind of wisdom to control and balance it. If you are too obsessed or enter the realm of madness, it will not be beneficial, but will be a burden, unable to broaden your mind, but instead blocking your intelligence.

In the early years of the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, Hanlin Sun (Yuanxiang) of Changshu wrote a preface to Qian Meixi of Jinkui's "Shu Tan," saying about "collecting": "It is generally like clouds and smoke passing by. Qian himself also said in a book: 'Collecting is an elegant matter, originally like clouds and smoke passing by, which can pass without staying. If you are greedy and covetous, it will turn elegance into vulgarity. Look at the collectors of ancient times, none of them have passed it down to their descendants for hundreds of years who can still keep it!'" The words are extremely insightful.

The words "collecting" and "passing by" seem contradictory on the surface. Since it is regarded as smoke and clouds passing by, why bother to collect it tightly? Therefore, Qian said: "Gao Jiangcun already said that people exhaust their resources to engage in collecting, which is no different from risking their lives to seek wealth and glory. And there is also a small seal that says: 'Jiangcun's thirty years of effort gathered.' It can be seen that he loves it deeply and is deeply addicted to it, and may not be able to regard it as clouds and smoke passing by." In fact, hobby is a mood, and collecting is a natural fact, which is not contradictory to "optimism." Mr. Qian himself was a great collector, and at the same time an optimist.

Yuan Hanyun of Xiangcheng was an accomplished man of literature and art, and loved antiquity as if it were his life. He had a large and exquisite collection of items, and his versions were much richer than those of his friends. He once engraved a seal with the inscription "May descendants always treasure it." Later, he felt that his hopes were too extravagant, and changed the seal to "Exist and perish with the body." It can be said that he was extremely saddened, but it was only a temporary emotional effect. Later, he lived in extreme poverty in Tianjin, and he could not avoid selling his beloved items for money. Then the descendants would certainly not always treasure them, and the individual would sometimes find it difficult to coexist with them. Therefore, what his seal expressed was only his own deep infatuation at the time.

Hanlin Ye Juchang of Suzhou spent his life searching for rubbings of steles and various rubbings. His Ruyuan Diary was never without some "post sellers" and "stele appraisers." In the year of Bing Shen, his only son died of illness, and he was endlessly saddened, saying that "the family heir has died, and the pillars of the hall have no one to rely on," and also saying that "the old paper in the box, I don't know whose hands it will fall into in the future!" He also said: "Who will collect and organize my life's painstaking searches in the future? Speaking of it makes me even more sad!" It seems that old Mr. Ye also hoped that "descendants would always treasure it." If a person has no descendants, the legacy will eventually be scattered. Two years later, the son of the deceased Hanlin Huang sold his father's treasures to Liulichang. Old Mr. Ye sighed and wrote down a few words: "Huang Benfu came to talk, and reunited the legacy with 2,800 gold to return it to the factory. If a son can read, he still cannot keep it. We can see through the illusion!" So he suddenly realized.

It turns out that the saying of preserving for generations originated in feudalism and was advocated by emperors. The imperial jade seal in history, as well as the words "eternal treasure" engraved on palace tripods and bells, can all prove the same meaning as the so-called "passing it down to all ages" and "the country's destiny is boundless."

Collectors often prepare some seals with the inscriptions "family collection," "family inheritance," etc., and stamp them on the steles, paintings, and books they collect. As a result, as Qian said and Ye lamented, they will inevitably be scattered elsewhere. Because there are no descendants, or the descendants are unworthy, or there are sons who can read but are intolerably poor, or the times are chaotic, or the cities change, all can break the reality of "family inheritance." Not to mention antiques, even houses, fields, and large mansions change owners and surnames. The emperors always say that they will be boundless for generations, but it is just a good-sounding word, a good-looking pattern. Not only is it impossible in fact, but it is also unnecessary in principle. Good things can be appreciated by everyone. If they are permanently locked in one family and one surname, it is not truly cherishing antiques.

The seals of gentlemen with clearer insights are not like that. They choose the words "Succession and Guarding" to verify that a certain object once belonged to the descendants of a certain predecessor, and they are considered a guardian who "continues to guard" it, and hint that if it is transferred to someone else's hands in the future, they also hope that he can recognize the goods and preserve them, such as Hanlin Li Lianxiu's rubbings, which are stamped with "Lianxiu Succession and Guarding," which is to cherish precious objects, not selfishness, is the succession of responsibility, not the succession of family, is "passing on to the worthy" rather than "passing on to the son," which has the atmosphere of "the world is for all" and the spirit of thoroughly cherishing things. Furthermore, "Once collected in a certain place," and the certain place is the name of the current owner. The prefix "Once" means that sooner or later it will belong to others, and "Once in my hands" is also optimistic. When others get it in the future, they will definitely laugh when they see the seal. He has already said it in advance.

Because of this, in many rubbings, both before and after, and even in the heaven and earth margins, various kinds of inscriptions such as "Someone's collection," "Someone's guarding," "Someone's seen," "Someone's," and "Someone's family" are stamped, which is very lively, and people who buy rubbings are even more interested in this, because it has been proven by many predecessors. At the same time, these seals have become treasures to be researched and appreciated, and the interest in them is perhaps even stronger than the original rubbings.

Qian Meixi also said that collectors are divided into three classes: one is appreciation, the second is good deeds, and the third is profit. Those who seek profit imitate hundreds of times and forge thousands of times to obtain money and goods, which are petty people in the market. According to this, it is the so-called "antique ghost." Imitation, interception, fumigation, its techniques are diverse, but no matter what, it cannot escape the eyes of true appraisers. The first method for identifying the authenticity of old and new is to focus on "charm" and "spirit." Those who "make old" can never compare to "true old," and those who imitate can never mix with genuine products. At the Pingdian Fair in Beiping, imitations of celebrity ink paintings from the Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties are available, and the paper, silk, and brushwork are also very good, but the imitation products must have several flaws. If you don't see it at first glance, you will understand it after another look.

In recent years, the cost of living has risen, and old families have released many fine products. Banmeng's letter stated that there are real prices and real things in Shanghai. The first page of a Yuan and Ming manuscript is Song Xue's original ink painting, and someone bought it for 400 million, which is not too expensive (converted to current foreign currency, it is limited)! Liu here has more than a dozen volumes of Song Xue's figure paintings, each with Song Xue's own inscription. Shao Yu's nephew introduced me to see them and asked me to appraise them. After viewing them, the spirit and energy were gathered, and there was no doubt that they were genuine works. An antique dealer has offered ten yellow goods, but the original owner is still unwilling to sell them, which shows how much he cherishes them.

That evening, Qi Wan returned to the Middle East Hotel. Dao Yun had already returned. Qi Wan didn't reveal a single expression. Upon seeing him, she smiled and said, "You're busy with work. I couldn't wait for you, so I went to see my mother today. My mother was very happy to see me in Shanghai, and she strongly approves of our matter. She only blamed me for not going with you today. I promised her that I would definitely pay my respects tomorrow, no matter what. You must set aside any important matters you have tomorrow and take care of this first. Otherwise, the old lady will be angry!" Dao Yun was very worried when he first heard that Qi Wan had gone to see her mother, but when he heard that Liu Ru had no objections to Qi Wan's marriage, he felt relieved and said, "Of course we must go. I originally planned to prepare everything for us before paying my respects to my future mother-in-law. Now that you've told her, then my planned schedule will have to change. I'll go with you first thing tomorrow morning." Qi Wan said, "That's not necessary. My mother doesn't get up until two o'clock every afternoon!" Dao Yun said, "Then we'll wait until after two o'clock to pay our respects. What gifts should we bring?" Qi Wan said, "You decide that. I won't offer any suggestions." Dao Yun said, "We came in such a hurry that we didn't bring any Beijing specialties. I can't think of what gifts to prepare now." Qi Wan said, "Why bother racking your brains over these things? My mother doesn't care about this. As long as you can please her when you meet her, that's the best thing." Dao Yun said, "I'm sure I can please her. She already likes me. Now that we're becoming relatives, and you're her most beloved daughter, there's no reason why she wouldn't like me." Qi Wan said, "I hope so!" Dao Yun didn't know what Qi Wan meant when she said that, so he didn't dare to ask any further questions. That night passed. The next morning, Dao Yun was busy going out to prepare gifts. At two o'clock in the afternoon, the two of them took a car to Mingde Lane to pay their respects to Liu Ru. When Liu Ru saw Dao Yun, she showed great affection, asking about his well-being and saying that she was very pleased to have this marriage connection. Afterwards, she asked him about his plans for the film production company. Dao Yun knew that Liu Ru had a lot of connections in the Shanghai film circle and that her information was very accurate, so he claimed that the headquarters were in Hong Kong. Although he reluctantly pointed out that many financial backers were helping, his words were not very natural. Liu Ru, who was experienced in worldly affairs, saw through Dao Yun's unreliable words after only a few questions. Immediately, she didn't reveal her true feelings and indulged him with flattery. She kept them for dinner before sending him back. When he was leaving, she secretly instructed Qi Wan to come again tomorrow. Qi Wan, after receiving this signal from Liu Ru, became even more disgusted with Dao Yun.

### This Newspaper's Wuzhou, Guangxi Reader Enquires About a Correspondence School for Poultry Farming

Respected Editor: I am a reader of your newspaper. Before the war, in 1939, I was introduced by your newspaper to the Deyuan Poultry Correspondence School in Shanghai, where I studied the complete course of chicken farming with Mr. Huang Zhongcheng. Since the enemy occupied Guangzhou and then invaded Wuzhou, I have lost seven-tenths of the complete set of books, which I find very regrettable. Now I would like to trouble the editor to inquire whether the Deyuan Poultry Correspondence School, which existed in Shanghai before the Japanese occupied Shanghai, still exists? What is the current address? And the address of Mr. Huang Zhongcheng, and where in Shanghai can his complete chicken farming book still be purchased? I respectfully request a reply! Sincerely, Reader Peng Runbiao, Correspondence Address: Wanxingxiang, Xiaonan Road, Wuzhou, Guangxi.
