[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] To strengthen price controls and crack down on hoarding, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been holding meetings for days to research and discuss the issue. This afternoon, the ministry held another meeting to discuss and draft implementation measures. The meeting of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce this afternoon began at 4:00 PM, presided over by Minister Chen Qitian, who had just returned to Nanjing from Shanghai this morning. The discussion lasted five and a half hours, adjourning at 9:30 PM. The important contents of the measures include the following: (1) To strengthen price controls, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will establish a Price Control Planning Committee. (2) Warehouses in the six major cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Hankou, Qingdao, and Chongqing will be subject to increased inspection. (3) The storage of goods must not exceed one-third or one-quarter of the annual sales volume. Exceeding this amount will be considered hoarding and prosecuted. (4) Prices will be limited to the prices of August 19 as the standard; violators will be dealt with according to the price limit regulations. (5) Items prohibited from import will be prohibited from sale in the market from September 11. (6) For domestic materials that can be sold abroad to exchange for foreign currency, separate measures for conserving consumption will be drafted. (7) For certain items permitted for import, the quantity of permitted imports will also be designated and restricted. After the adjournment of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce meeting, Fei Mingyang, Director of the Price Control Department, organized the above measures and submitted them to Chen Qitian at 10:30 PM, who will submit them to the Executive Yuan for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 25th.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] Although the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce have been actively drafting supplementary implementation measures to streamline finances and strengthen financial controls for days, only a portion has been completed. Only a portion will be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion on the 25th. Regarding raising the capital of banks and financial institutions and reorganizing financial institutions, the Monetary Department of the Ministry of Finance held multiple discussions on the 24th, but the maximum amount of the capital increase is still under consideration, and a final decision has not been drafted as of the 24th, so it will not be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion on the 25th. However, the department's proposed amendment to the "Measures for Handling the Collection, Purchase, and Manufacture of Gold Ornaments by Silver Shops" has been submitted to Wang Yunwu, requesting that it be submitted to the Executive Yuan, and it is expected to be submitted on the 25th. The National Taxation Administration and the Local Finance Department have also drafted several amendments to tax rates and local finance measures, which will be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion. The measures drafted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on the 24th also only initially completed the more important measures regarding price controls, crackdown on hoarding, and prohibition of the sale of imported luxury goods.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu again visited Premier Weng at the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 24th to review the positive results of the first day after the issuance of the Gold Yuan notes and to discuss supplementary implementation measures to streamline finances and strengthen financial controls. Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian also met with Premier Weng in the morning after returning to Nanjing on the morning of the 24th. It is also learned that the Ministry of Finance originally scheduled a ministry meeting for the morning of the 24th, but because Wang Yunwu and Xu Baiyuan both went to the Executive Yuan to meet Premier Weng, and Vice Minister Li Tang also attended the meeting of vice ministers, there was no one to preside, so it was not held.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The preparation fund for the issuance of the Gold Yuan notes has been expedited by the Ministry of Finance in consultation with relevant agencies to prepare and submit a detailed list, which will be fully transferred to the custody of the Gold Yuan Note Issuance Preparation Fund Supervision Committee within days.

### Xu Baiyuan Meets with the President to Report on the Financial Situation in Shanghai; Four Allied Banking Administrations Schedule Meeting to Discuss Lending Issues

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiguo returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 24th and immediately went to the Executive Yuan in the morning to meet Premier Weng and report on the financial situation in Shanghai after the issuance of the Gold Yuan notes, as well as the process of negotiating with various parties in Shanghai to implement several technical issues related to the currency reform. The President inquired in detail about the market's reaction to the currency reform.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] After the currency reform, state-owned banks were ordered to suspend lending for one week. Whether lending should continue to be suspended starting next week, and whether the lending policy should be changed in the future, all need to be reconsidered. The Four Allied Banking Administrations have scheduled a board meeting for the 28th to discuss various related issues regarding the lending or suspension of lending by state-owned banks.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] After the bank interest rate was agreed to be 15%, the government, fearing that the interest rate was too high and would affect prices, decided to continue to lower it, reducing it to 10% or less. At the same time, strict restrictions will be imposed on the amount of gasoline used by cars in Shanghai, and the price of gasoline will be further reduced.

### Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce Supports New Currency; Proposes Suggestions for Stabilizing Prices; Song ZIwen Orders Crackdown on Capital Flight

[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 24th] The Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce recently held a symposium, unanimously supporting the new currency and proposing three suggestions for stabilizing prices: (1) Starting from the 25th, all stores in the city should uniformly use Gold Yuan notes to mark prices. (2) The prices of all goods should be based on the prices of the 19th, and public prices should be negotiated based on the Shenghui difference. (3) After the public prices are negotiated by each industry, they will not be raised again without government approval, and the rice price will be set at a maximum of 21 Gold Yuan and a minimum of 14.5 Gold Yuan per 100 shi jin, and will be approved and announced by the Social Affairs Bureau.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 24th] Ten groups of agriculture, industry, commerce, and fisheries in Guangdong sent a telegram on the 24th to support the government's currency reform.

[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 24th] After Chairman Zhu Ziwen concurrently served as the Economic Control Supervisor of the Secret District, he convened a financial and price symposium on the 22nd with the heads of relevant agencies. Zhu said: "This currency reform is more painful for the people of Guangdong than in other places. This is because in the past, tightening currency, stopping the southward flow of floating capital, and cracking down on speculation led to low Shanghai telegrams. One Hong Kong dollar on the black market in Shanghai was worth more than 2 million yuan, but in Guangzhou it was only 1.15 million yuan. With the issuance of cash Gold Yuan notes, the exchange rate for foreign currency is nearly the same as the Shanghai black market, but in Guangdong it is twice as different, which makes Guangdong prices also rise twice as much. Secondly, in the past two months, the government used force to stop smuggling. Smugglers only died five, with five or six hundred injured. The national army also had considerable losses. This is also something that other places do not have. However, this currency reform concerns the future of the country and the nation. Only success is allowed, not failure. Therefore, each industry needs to be advised to have a spirit of sacrifice to overcome all difficulties." Zhu also instructed Mayor Ouyang to convene another meeting to properly discuss ways to stabilize prices and crack down on capital flight, and instructed the Deputy Director of the Pacification Headquarters to draft measures to strengthen anti-smuggling.

### Macau Gold Prices Plunge

They stayed in Macau for three days and visited Macau Governor Ker Livilla, our diplomatic commissioner to Macau Guo Zefan, the Macau branch of the Kuomintang, Li Bingmi, and various overseas Chinese groups and newspaper offices, who all warmly received them. The Macau Governor told reporters that he was willing to make the greatest efforts to promote friendly relations between China and Portugal and that he would do his best to assist any measures that would benefit China, such as the Sino-Macau Customs Agreement. Our diplomatic commissioner to Macau, Guo Zefan, said that the Macau authorities had recently announced the cancellation of the Chinese Customary Law enacted in 1909, and that starting from the 20th of this month, all administrative matters related to overseas Chinese would be handled in accordance with our country's current laws. Reporters observed for three days and gained a very good impression of the Macau authorities' municipal administration and overseas Chinese relief and charitable undertakings. This time, our currency reform was particularly well received by overseas merchants. Gold prices plunged, falling from 380 Portuguese patacas to 310 Portuguese patacas.

### US Warships Passing Through Qingdao Can Exchange Back US Dollars

### Zhang Lisheng Flies to Tianjin This Morning; Hopes That Holders of Gold and US Dollars in North China Will Actively Exchange; Prices Will Definitely Stabilize After Two Weeks

[Central News Agency, This City] Zhang Lisheng, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, who was appointed to supervise economic control in the Tianjin area, arrived in Shanghai last night and is scheduled to fly to Tianjin by plane this morning. Zhang spoke freely about economic reform yesterday, saying that the most important thing at present is that all sectors of society have firm confidence and unanimously support it, so the success of currency reform can be expected. At the same time, the government must also thoroughly implement, seize the opportunity, and advance the four programs in separate ways, connect with each other, and plan comprehensively, without making piecemeal responses. Zhang said that the Economic Control Committee will be established in Beijing soon to coordinate and resolve all technical difficulties. Before the committee is established, anything that society needs or the local government believes should be done should be done quickly without waiting, so as not to miss the opportunity. Regarding the recent rise in retail prices in some places, Zhang believes that the reason is that retailers have not thoroughly understood the government's measures, and this phenomenon is not a cause for concern. He predicts that price fluctuations are still inevitable within two weeks, but they will definitely stabilize in the future, and industry and commerce will be able to develop normally. Zhang expressed optimism about the prospects for promoting economic reform in North China. He also hopes that holders of gold and US dollars in North China will also actively exchange them, showing their patriotic spirit that is not inferior to others. Regarding the supply, distribution, and circulation of materials in North China, Zhang said that he is eager to assist in seeking reasonable solutions under the principle of taking into account both the central and local governments.

### Measures for Managing Trade with Japan Are Gradually Improved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; The Quantity of Export and Import Goods Between the Two Countries Will Be Re-Designated

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 24th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce said that recently, the Allied Headquarters in Japan stipulated that the Japanese government's control over export trade will be abolished from the 15th of this month, allowing merchants from various countries to directly trade with Japanese merchants. At the same time, the Japanese government is also allowed to trade with foreign delegations or companies stationed in Japan, while the Allied Headquarters is only in a supervisory and guiding position. In order to adapt to the current trend, our country is planning to gradually improve various management measures regarding trade with Japan. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to relax the number of merchant representatives going to Japan and the length of their stay in Japan. Also, the types and quantities of goods entering and exiting between China and Japan will also be re-produced and ordered according to actual needs.

The procedures for selecting merchant representatives and the necessary procedures for visa registration are also being planned for improvement in order to facilitate merchants and people to promote trade. In addition, after the government promulgated the Measures for Streamlining Finances and Strengthening Economic Controls, various measures for the management of import and export and foreign exchange management of our country will be revised. Various relevant measures for our country's trade with Japan must also be appropriately modified to match the overall trade policy. This amendment is also being carefully reviewed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.

Editorial

### An Appeal on Behalf of Public Servants and Teachers!

The people have absolute trust in the new currency system after the reform. Only with trust can the nation be saved; only with trust can the people themselves be saved. Otherwise, the nation's future will be bleak, and the people themselves will suffer endlessly. Therefore, today we, the people, have no room for hesitation or doubt regarding the four measures promulgated for emergency economic measures. We should accept them all and resolutely support them.

Finance Minister Wang, in order to "approach balanced revenue and expenditure," in addition to adjusting taxes to increase revenue, is focusing more on reducing the salaries of public servants and teachers to curtail expenditure. This is something that deserves everyone's attention. Increasing revenue and curtailing expenditure are the only ways to manage finances, but increasing revenue must be reasonable, and curtailing expenditure must also be reasonable. Otherwise, the result may not be close but rather distant. In order to earnestly implement the reform plan, we cannot help but make a special appeal on this point on behalf of public servants and teachers!

In the past, the low salaries of public servants and teachers have been criticized. The low work efficiency and the prevalence of corruption and bribery all stem from the excessively low salaries. Now, to achieve the practical effects of economic reform, it is especially necessary to eliminate general malpractices. Because no matter how strict and appropriate the measures are, if public servants cannot even afford to eat enough, and their children cannot afford to go to school, how can we expect them to be effective in their work? If they are ineffective, or perfunctory, or take advantage of the situation, then mere laws will not be able to function on their own. For example, in the collection of taxes, if the execution is effective, so that there are no loopholes and private corruption is eliminated, so that every penny goes to the public, then with the current various taxes, with some adjustments, not only can the balance of revenue and expenditure be approached, but it may even be balanced, or even exceed the pre-war amount. Otherwise, if the income of the tax collectors is not enough to maintain their integrity, the good ones will either starve to death or seek other jobs, and any adjustment will still inevitably fill the pockets of the tax collectors, benefit the unscrupulous merchants who manipulate things from top to bottom, and make the common people suffer from exploitation, and ultimately will not save the emptiness of the national treasury. Guan Zhong's saying, "When clothing and food are sufficient, then one knows honor and shame," is truly an unshakeable conclusion throughout the ages. To expect public servants and teachers to be honest and law-abiding, I am afraid that it cannot be achieved solely by relying on the moral rearmament movement.

According to Article 19 of the Measures for Reorganizing Finances and Strengthening Economic Controls: "The salaries of all civil and military public servants and teachers shall be paid in Gold Yuan, with the standard based on the original salary of 40 yuan. For the portion exceeding 40 yuan up to 300 yuan, 20% shall be paid in Gold Yuan. For the portion exceeding 300 yuan, 10% shall be paid in Gold Yuan. Soldiers' salaries and food allowances shall be paid in Gold Yuan in full according to the pre-war amount, without any discount." Article 3 of the same measures states: "The fees for state-owned public utilities and transportation services that are lower than the pre-war standard shall be allowed to be adjusted with reference to the pre-war standard. ..." Article 13: "The prices of all kinds of goods and services nationwide shall be sold by converting them into Gold Yuan at the exchange rate based on the prices of various goods in each locality on August 19, 1937, and shall be strictly supervised and enforced by the local competent authorities." If we analyze and summarize these three articles, we are deeply afraid that public servants and teachers will be in a situation where they cannot maintain their livelihoods in the future!

On August 19, the price of rice in legal tender converted to Gold Yuan was twice as high as before the war. Daily necessities such as Longtou fine cloth, pork, cooking oil, and soap have also risen by more than three times, and white newsprint has even risen by more than six times (see the price comparison table of legal tender converted to Gold Yuan in the Shangbao on August 22). If the fees for public utilities and transportation services are successively adjusted according to the pre-war standard, they will at least increase by one time. If the salaries of public servants and teachers are based on the pre-war standard, that is, paid in Gold Yuan in full without any discount, like the salaries of soldiers, it will already require public servants and teachers to shoulder a burden that is twice or more than twice as heavy as before the war. If their salaries are discounted using a progressive system, it will reduce their income by half to three-quarters. On the one hand, income is reduced, and the reduction is so much. On the other hand, expenses are increased, and the increase is so great. If they have no other way to adjust, the general public servants and teachers will only have to work on an empty stomach, let alone support their families. With such important administrative matters entrusted to public servants and teachers with such treatment, how much effort can we expect them to put in? Of course, we hope that one or two sages will emerge, content with poverty, upholding the law, working diligently day and night, and serving the people, but how can we expect everyone to do so? Since the new economic measures were promulgated and implemented, we not only hope that Finance Minister Wang can henceforth approach a balance of revenue and expenditure, but also demand that Finance Minister Wang further balance revenue and expenditure. Because the key to the success of the new currency system lies in the balance of national revenue and expenditure. We demand balanced revenue and expenditure and of course sympathize with Finance Minister Wang's principle of curtailing expenditure, but we really cannot agree with such curtailment for public servants and teachers, for the sake of overall political efficiency and political discipline. In fact, there are many superfluous agencies and redundant personnel in various agencies. If two or three agencies are merged into one in a straightforward manner, and the work that was done by two or three people is completely handed over to one person, and the funds saved are distributed to agencies that really have things to do and personnel who are really working hard, wouldn't Finance Minister Wang's principle of curtailing expenditure still be achieved? When we talk about administrative efficiency, is it better to achieve twice the result with half the effort, or half the result with twice the effort? If you want the horse to be good, but you don't want the horse to eat grass, I am afraid there is no such cheap thing that violates the principles of nature, let alone that public servants and teachers are ultimately human beings!

We absolutely love the country, and we wholeheartedly support the government, so we cherish the economic reform measures promulgated by the government, and we cannot bear to see them die in the hands of public servants who are not fed enough and lack strength. To have the success of economic reform measures, we must cherish Finance Minister Wang, who bears the important responsibility of implementation: to have Finance Minister Wang proceed smoothly with economic reform measures, we must cherish public servants and teachers who perform their duties for the country and the people. In order to cherish public servants and teachers, we must make a sincere appeal on behalf of public servants and teachers regarding the current regulations on treatment! Anyone who is concerned will not consider this appeal to be nonsense!

### Gold Yuan Appears in New Form in Shenyang, Currency System Unified Inside and Outside the Pass, Merchants and People Excited and Competing to Accept It

[Our Newspaper Shenyang 24th Dispatch] The general perception of the Gold Yuan in Shenyang is very good, and the belief in it is also more firm than that in the legal tender currency. Everyone is eagerly exchanging and treasuring it out of curiosity. Currently circulating in the market are 10 yuan, 5 yuan, 2 jiao, and 1 jiao denominations, with each bank exchanging 50,000 yuan per day.

[Central News Agency Shenyang 24th Dispatch] The Gold Yuan appeared in this market on the 23rd in a brand-new form, and merchants and people are competing to accept it with joy and excitement. Wang Zhong, director of the Northeast Branch of the Central Bank, recently told reporters that the advantages of issuing Gold Yuan for the Northeast are the unification of the currency system inside and outside the Pass, and the long-pending issues such as the restrictions on withdrawals and cash withdrawals from the Northeast circulating currency will be easily resolved. He also stated that the number of Gold Yuan notes that the bank has transported in recent days is extremely large, which is sufficient to meet the current needs of the Northeast.

[Our Newspaper Shenyang 24th Dispatch] The impact of the Gold Yuan in the special environment of the Northeast is of concern to economists. The Northeast is isolated by transportation and lacks the most resources. Relying solely on increasing chips is not enough to stabilize prices. The key to the success or failure of the Gold Yuan depends on whether a large number of materials are transported to Shenyang. Secondly, the expansion of the number of circulating notes issued is also quite difficult to recover.

[Our Newspaper Shenyang 24th Dispatch] It is learned that although Changchun, which is besieged, has great hopes for the Gold Yuan, due to transportation difficulties, the authorities have decided to temporarily suspend the use of the new currency in Changchun.

[Our Newspaper Taipei 24th Dispatch] According to Finance Director Ma, after the currency reform, although the Taiwan dollar has been retained, the financial economy of Taiwan Province must have a new plan to coordinate with the Gold Yuan. The relevant departments are currently conducting research separately. In the short term, the Finance Department will draft a comprehensive new plan, the most important of which is to adjust the salaries of civil servants in the province, which may be increased by 50%, and the second is to reorganize taxes to balance financial revenue and expenditure, and to re-determine the profit rate of public utility agencies.

[Our Newspaper Taipei 24th Dispatch] The Taiwan Bank's exchange of gold and US dollars was still crowded on the 24th.

### Investigating Communist Spies Among Students: Beiping Police and Military Police Chiefs Visit Hu Shi at Peking University; Hu Shi Exchanges Letters with Chen Jicheng

Director Yang explained the mission to detain the students and requested his assistance in completing it. After President Hu informed them of the school's own investigation, the three, accompanied by police and military police, and Peking University Dean of Students He Lin, inspected the various departments. Regarding the arrest of communist spies among the students of Peking University, President Hu Shi and Commander Chen Jicheng of the Beiping Garrison Command exchanged letters yesterday and today. The text is as follows:

(1) President Hu's letter to Commander Chen: "Mr. Jicheng: Of the fifty Peking University students summoned by the Special Criminal Court this time, other than He Qingxiang and Hu Jide, who do not exist, there are forty-eight. These forty-eight have been thoroughly investigated by responsible senior personnel of the school, with the following results: (1) Six have already reported to the court. (2) One will report to the court immediately. (3) Three were expelled from the school by public announcement on July 21st. (4) It is confirmed that seven have left Beiping and gone south. (5) Two have left the school. (6) Four have already graduated and are employed or interning elsewhere. (7) Twenty-five are not in the dormitories, names omitted. The results of the above investigation have been reported to me in writing by the Dean of Students of Peking University, etc., who take responsibility for them. Dean of Students He Lin said, 'In addition to the dormitory managers reporting that the students in the Sand Beach area are not in their usual dormitories, I, Lin, personally inspected the dormitories in the West Wing, Red Building, and Gray Building last night (the 22nd) in an attempt to find the students and persuade them to go to court to be questioned. I found that none of the students were in their assigned dormitories and could not be found anywhere.' I believe the above report to be absolutely true, so I dare to inform you specifically. We are now investigating students of this school who are in Beiping but avoiding arrest. All will have their student status suspended and will not be allowed to register or reside in the school. I sincerely hope that you and your colleagues will believe my report and guarantee. Respectfully, Hu Shi, July 20th, 37."

(2) Commander Chen's reply to President Hu: "Mr. Shizhi: I have received your letter of the 23rd regarding the matter of the Special Criminal Court summoning students. The security authorities have a responsibility to assist in the execution. We naturally believe that you guarantee that there is no one left among the students of your school who have been summoned except those who have reported to the authorities. According to the report from the responsible officers of the military police, they have entered the school and seen the results of the investigation, which are the same as your investigation. We hope that for students who are confirmed to be not in Beiping, the school will inform them to report to the local court as soon as possible, otherwise they will also be expelled from school. If they or their accomplices engage in activities in the school again, the military police with judicial police duties will go to the school to arrest them at any time according to their duties. This must first be declared to you. Wishing you good health! Chen Jicheng, 24th"

### Stalin Holds Lengthy Talks with Western Envoys; Stalemate on German Question Broken; Optimism for Extension of Moscow Conference

[Report from This Newspaper] London 24th Broadcast, Reuters: After the British, American, and French envoys held their second meeting with Stalin this morning, a general agreement has been reached, but many specialized issues require further deliberation. When U.S. Ambassador Smith left the Kremlin, he appeared pleased and said, "We will continue to consult." According to a qualified source, "The seven meetings at the Kremlin hold hope for a final agreement. The situation of this meeting has improved compared to the last one, and there is no longer a pessimistic atmosphere." This meeting lasted longer, and both sides adopted a very frank and humble attitude. It is expected that the four powers will soon issue a joint statement.

[Report from This Newspaper] London 24th Broadcast: According to well-informed White House sources, Stalin proposed some "new ideas" in the meeting on the 24th, which gave hope for breaking the Berlin stalemate. The nature of the "new ideas" has not been revealed, but this new development has completely eliminated the fear that the Berlin talks will break down. At the same time, the extension of the Moscow Conference can at least temporarily avoid the outbreak of a serious international situation.

[Agence France-Presse Moscow 24th Dispatch] After the meeting between the three-power envoys and Stalin, British Envoy Roberts told reporters, "We have just held a four-hour and forty-minute meeting with Marshal Stalin and have made good progress. There will be another meeting in the future." However, Roberts did not disclose the date of the next meeting. Last night, Stalin received the envoys of the three countries at the Kremlin at 9:00 PM (Moscow time) and began talks immediately, which ended at 1:40 AM today. Today, the British envoy first made a definite statement on the progress of the Moscow talks to eliminate the fog and general pessimism that have existed since the beginning of the Moscow talks about three weeks ago.

[Associated Press Moscow 24th Dispatch] It is reported that Marshal Stalin has eliminated obstacles in the five-hour meeting from the evening of the 23rd to the morning of the 24th, enabling a series of new negotiations on the German question to continue. U.S. Ambassador Smith left the Kremlin at 1:45 AM. He pointed out that Stalin had personally broken the deadlock on the German question, allowing the negotiations to continue, but he refused to disclose what results had been produced in the four-hour and forty-five-minute conversation. A full report of the conversation is being sent to Washington, London, and Paris. Observers believe that new negotiations with Foreign Minister Molotov may be held before the weekend, and Stalin may also participate. The meeting with Stalin on the evening of the 23rd was apparently requested by the Western envoys because they knew that the talks with Molotov alone were approaching a dead end. It is generally believed here that only Stalin can break the deadlock, and this hope is not considered too great. Just before the meeting with Stalin, a farewell cocktail party for Special Envoy Roberts was indeed held at the British Embassy. It is not yet known what concessions Stalin has made to allow the negotiations to continue. But it has long been known that the Western envoys have refused to consider any negotiations on Germany before the Berlin blockade is lifted.

[Associated Press London 24th Dispatch] Authoritative sources stated on the 24th that the current deadlock in the Moscow talks on lifting the Berlin blockade is due to the Berlin currency issue. Behind this issue is the broader issue of the Western powers' presence in Berlin and having an equal voice. The Western powers are prepared to accept East German Soviet currency as the currency of Berlin, but they insist that this currency must be jointly managed by the four powers within Berlin and not solely by the Soviet Union.

### U.S. Unofficially Suggests to Soviets: Troops Withdraw from Borders to Ease Current Tensions in Berlin

[Associated Press Berlin 24th Dispatch] U.S. military authorities unofficially suggested to the Soviets on the 24th that the troops of the four powers withdraw from the borderlines of the Berlin districts to ease tensions between the Eastern and Western sectors.

This suggestion was delivered by a low-ranking U.S. official to a low-ranking Soviet official. The letter is believed to have been delivered to Major General Kotikov, the Soviet military commander in Berlin, and has been approved by senior U.S. military authorities. According to the above suggestion, German police from the three districts will be allowed to patrol border areas without the supervision and assistance of occupying power military police. According to the most well-informed sources, if a favorable response is obtained, an agreement will be formally established. At the same time, due to the Soviet side's compromising attitude, the British side will also release Lebedev, a senior Soviet official of the Soviet-controlled Berlin radio station, who was arrested on the 23rd for entering the British sector.

### Berlin City Elections: Soviets Order Postponement to Autumn Next Year; Western Occupied Sectors Will Make Statement

[Associated Press Berlin 24th Dispatch] Soviet occupation commander Sokolovsky today ordered the postponement of Berlin's autumn elections by one year. Observers immediately interpreted his action as acknowledging that the Soviet Union's position had been weakened by the Berlin blockade. Sokolovsky issued a communique stating that, due to repeated requests from labor groups and party leaders, the election will be postponed to the autumn of 1949. Sokolovsky's unilateral decision will have no effect on the three sectors occupied by the four powers, and it is generally expected that the Western countries will make a statement regarding the Soviet decision. The Berlin autumn elections have long been a focus of political contention. This is the first Berlin city election since the communist-controlled Socialist Unity Party won 20 percent of the vote in the autumn of 1946.

### U.S. Military Government in Korea Announces End; U.S. Occupation Troops Will Not Withdraw; Hodge Returns to U.S., Muccio Becomes Supreme Representative

[Associated Press Washington 23rd Dispatch] The United States has formally announced the end of its military occupation in Korea. General Hodge is transferring his duties, etc., to Ambassador Muccio. Since Lee Seungman became the President of Korea on August 15 and the United States recognized Korea, it was widely believed that the United States would take this measure. Muccio will be given the title of Senior U.S. Representative to Korea. This means that the government in the form of a three-year military occupation has come to an end, but it does not mean that all U.S. troops will withdraw. They will remain in Korea to assist the new government.

Former Deputy Commander of the U.S. Military Government in Korea, Coulter, will succeed Hodge. Hodge's new assignment order has not yet been announced. He has been ordered to report to the Army Headquarters in Washington first. President Truman wrote to Hodge, saying, "The establishment of the South Korean government has ended your difficult mission. The transfer of power in Korea to its own people will certainly satisfy you, and our government is also very satisfied." Secretary of the Army Royal and Chief of Staff Bradley also congratulated Hodge. Hodge has lived abroad for six years, except for one trip home last year. He has been in Korea since the end of the war against Japan. The State Department announced that Muccio's mission will be to negotiate the training of new Korean soldiers, transfer the property of the occupation forces to the Korean government, and transfer the former Japanese property to Korea. Building a new army in Korea in addition to the police organization will also be within the plan to establish a security force within the United Nations. State Department and Army Department officials have frankly stated that U.S. troops will remain in Korea as long as the U.S. and Korea believe that the U.S. occupation forces can resist the Soviet-trained North Korean army. It is estimated that there are about 125,000 Soviet-trained North Korean troops, and the South Korean police are estimated to have 26,000. The informal estimate of U.S. troops is about 23,000. In addition, Muccio must be responsible for merging the former occupation expenses with the Economic Cooperation Administration. The State Department announced that Muccio will negotiate a bilateral agreement with Lee Seungman to bring the aid program to Korea into the aid program to China. The aid fund for Korea is the unspent occupation fee allocated by Congress to the Army Department, totaling about 100 million U.S. dollars. Muccio's problems also include the electricity dispute with the Soviet commander in North Korea, Mogulov. Although the Korean government will also participate, Muccio will provide assistance.

### America's Misstep Regarding the German Situation

— Translated by Zhang Shi

What follows is an article about how the United States relinquished its military advantage in Germany. The original article was published in the July 23rd issue of "U.S. News & World Report."

As World War II was coming to an end, the American offensive into Germany was very strong, and capturing Berlin would not have been difficult. However, the United States did not attack Berlin in order to honor military treaties. At that time, American forces had penetrated deeply into Czechoslovakia, and the area they occupied, plus the areas occupied by British, French, and other Allied forces, was much larger than present-day West Germany. As a result, the United States, in order to abide by the treaties, handed over all the extra territory it had occupied to the Soviet Union. Although Berlin remained under Allied occupation, this created the precedent for the Berlin problem and the German problem of today.

The Soviet Union's coercion of the United States, Britain, and France in Berlin stems from the abandonment of a favorable position at that time. The fact is that if there had been no wartime treaty provisions during World War II, American forces could have occupied Berlin much earlier. Because of the wartime treaty provisions, Berlin had to be left for the Soviets to conquer. At the same time, a large portion of German territory occupied by American troops was given to the Soviet Union as the price for the American forces' advance on Berlin.

When the Soviet Union allowed British and American Allied forces to enter Berlin, there was no explicit agreement regarding the West's unlimited access to and from Berlin. Therefore, the Soviet Union, due to its territorial and power advantages, was able to have the power to blockade Western transportation routes to Berlin today. General Clay, the commander of the American forces stationed in Germany, once engaged in negotiations regarding the German problem. However, the result of the negotiations was to promote the Soviet Union's establishment of the Iron Curtain and its control over the supply lines to Berlin. The reason why the United States abandoned its original advantageous position in Germany after the end of the war was entirely voluntary. The following are the facts that occurred.

In 1945, when American troops arrived at the outskirts of Berlin, they stopped their advance. This was due to America's desire to abide by the treaty. In mid-April 1945, American troops reached Magdeburg along the Elbe River, a place only fifty miles away from Berlin. They also established bridgeheads, preparing to cross the river. The American commanders also knew that it would be easier to attack Berlin from there, and both the German troops and the people of Berlin hoped that the Western forces would be the first to capture the city, because they believed that the Western forces would be more benevolent than the Soviet troops. Despite these advantages, the American vanguard remained stationed in the Elbe River region and did not advance.

General Marshall, who was then the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, reported to the U.S. military that "The Elbe River is the agreed-upon limit of the American advance with the Soviet Union." Indeed, this kind of regulation was good in order to avoid confusion when Western and Soviet troops met. The American troops waited for a long time before the Soviet troops arrived and surrounded Berlin. By the time they had extinguished the last resistance, it was already May 1st. The American troops had waited a full two weeks.

Elsewhere, under the military treaty, the only places where the Soviet Union allowed American troops to be stationed were Thuringia and Saxony, so the vast area was entirely under the control of Soviet troops. The issue of the Soviet occupation zone was already stipulated during the London Conference on September 12, 1944, and the subsequent Yalta Conference, in consultations between President Roosevelt, Marshal Stalin, and Prime Minister Churchill.

At the beginning of World War II, Germany had occupied Czechoslovakia. Later, in order to prevent the Sudetenland area of the Bohemian Mountains from becoming an "inner fortress" for the Germans to resist the Allied forces, the American troops swept through the area. On May 6th, when American troops were only fifty miles away from Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, they stopped their advance again. Later, Soviet troops belatedly conquered Prague and boasted greatly that they had "liberated" Czechoslovakia. In Austria, American troops also advanced until the German commander in Austria surrendered to the American Sixth Army on May 6th, at which point the advance stopped.

After Germany's defeat, the United States, eager to reach a conclusion at the Potsdam Conference in July of that year, which was attended by President Truman, Marshal Stalin, and Prime Minister Churchill, gave up its disputable rights in Berlin. After Soviet troops entered Berlin, in order to expand their occupation area, they allowed the United States, Britain, and France to enter Berlin, dividing Berlin into four occupation zones: British, American, French, and Soviet. The American troops only obtained the right to occupy Berlin, but handed over the three hundred miles from the Czech border to Vitebsk to the Soviet troops according to the agreement. The British troops also handed over the area from Vitebsk to the Baltic Sea to the Soviet troops according to the agreement. At that time, the four powers assumed that they could have normal transportation rights to the Berlin occupation zone.

On June 14, 1945, President Truman first notified Stalin, proposing that if the military commanders in Germany had reached a satisfactory agreement on matters concerning Berlin, then American troops could immediately withdraw to their original occupation zones. Stalin agreed to Truman's proposal at that time.

In mid-June, the Soviet commander in Germany, Zhukov, hosted the American and British delegations at the Soviet headquarters in Berlin. The chairman of the American delegation at that time was General Clay, and the representative from the State Department was Murphy. The American and British representatives proposed that the West should have various transportation facilities to and from Berlin, but Zhukov refused. The Soviet side only suggested implementing the previous treaty, ordering the military commanders of the four countries to have supreme rights within their respective occupation zones.

Regarding the basic treaty on Berlin, the only thing accepted by General Clay and the Western delegations was the "corridor" for transportation to Berlin. This treaty was signed on June 29, 1945. As a result, the right to control Western land and water transportation to Berlin remained in the hands of the Soviet Union. The free access proposed by the United States only received verbal permission from the Soviet side, without any explicit agreement. At that time, the United States and Britain withdrew from the original Soviet-occupied area, and the Western Allied forces entered the city of Berlin.

Unexpectedly, what is currently being encountered is a dispute over transportation between Berlin and the West. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France hope that the Soviet Union can lift its blockade of transportation to Berlin, but the Soviet Union has not given the Western powers any document allowing free transportation between the West and Berlin. Therefore, it seems that unless the United Kingdom, the United States, and France make concessions to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union is unlikely to ease its pressure to force the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to withdraw from Berlin.

### A New War Brews in the Holy Land: Jewish Side Claims Arab Forces Have Concentrated on the Border of the Holy Land; Arab Allied Forces and Iraqi Forces Decide to Unify Command

[United Press International, Tel Aviv, 24th] An Israeli military spokesman on the 24th condemned the Arabs for carrying out new war preparations within Transjordan. At the same time, the Arab Allied Forces and the Iraqi Forces have declared that they have merged under a unified command. According to a notification issued from Amman, the capital of Transjordan, King Abdullah's Arab Allied Forces and the Iraqi Forces have agreed on the 22nd to unify their command. These negotiations have been going on for several days. The above agreement was signed in the palace, and King Abdullah personally presided over the meeting. The Arab Allied Forces are the largest army in the Middle East. Their supply depends on Britain's $8 million grant to Transjordan. Lieutenant General Glubb, the commander of the Allied Forces, is currently in Britain discussing this year's grant. The Israeli government said that it received reports last week that Cookgy had resigned from his position as commander of the "Army for the Liberation of the People of Palestine." This army includes volunteers from all over the Arab world and is led by Syria and Iraq. It is currently fighting in Palestine. The Israeli military spokesman here said that a considerable degree of war preparations is underway at the joint Iraqi-Transjordanian base of Muweilah, a few miles from the Palestinian border. It is said that troops and vehicles have been concentrated there over the past week. In the past few days, Arab irregulars, aided by Iraqi artillery, have shelled the Rei'ain area, a few miles east of Tel Aviv, but the Israeli army has not retaliated. According to other sources, Israeli forces shelled Tel Radar in Rechitzvim, while the Arab Allied Forces shelled the Jewish residential area of ​​Kiser.

### Three Prisoners Escape from Shanghai Prison; Ring Leader of Gold Bar Case Breaks Free; Cutting Iron Bars in the Rain, They Flee Together; Chen Yuansheng, Arrested Two Years Ago

[Our Newspaper's Report] At approximately 1 AM yesterday morning, three important theft criminals escaped from Shanghai Prison. One of them was Chen Yuansheng, the ring leader of the Central Bank gold bar case who was sentenced to life imprisonment two years ago. The other two thieves were Jiang Jixiang and Wang Hailiang. The former was sentenced to seven years in prison, and the latter was sentenced to four years in prison. By the time it was discovered, they had already fled without a trace. Afterwards, two hacksaws, one pair of pliers, one hammer, and one piece of lead wire were found, proving that the escape was premeditated and had been planned for a long time.

Before the three criminals escaped, they were all assigned to work as orderlies at the prison hospital and slept together in a room in the southwest corner of the fifth floor. In addition, another thief named Liu Aliou lived in the same room. Because he was sentenced to four years and was about to be released, he did not want to take the risk and stayed behind. It was found that the prison cell on the fifth floor has a flat balcony railing outside. Whenever it is opened, prisoners always use it to dry bedding and wash. Therefore, every morning, they took advantage of the convenience of drying blankets on the railing to secretly use a hacksaw to gradually cut through one of the iron bars. At the same time, they gradually stole and retained scattered gauze bandages from the hospital and made twenty-four rope strands. Then, they divided the strands and made two thick ropes, each thirteen feet long. When all preparations were completed, the three criminals took advantage of the gray sky and sudden downpour yesterday morning to begin their operation. They further discovered that there was no one in the southeast corner watchtower, so they successively climbed down the leaking water pipe like monkeys through the gap of the sawn-off railing. After reaching the bottom floor, the watchtower doors and windows were tightly closed. They then used a hacksaw to cut off the iron lock, jumped through the window, and walked to the second floor again. From a window without iron bars, they tied the rope made of gauze and climbed down to the square outside the prison. This place is also the execution ground where thieves are executed each time. Afterwards, they crossed the low wall and disappeared into Kunming Road.

It was not until approximately 3 AM that Kong Xiangyu, a member of the guard section, went to inspect the prison and discovered this matter. He reported it to the section chief, who reported it to the military and police agencies overnight, and a joint investigation is underway.

### August 19th Prices to Be Announced Today; Social Bureau Convenes Discussion Meeting; Urging All Industries to Voluntarily Suppress Prices

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the currency reform, general prices have been quite stable, but daily food items such as vegetables and fresh meat still fluctuate. In order to implement the central government's order that prices must not exceed those of August 19th, the Social Bureau convened a price review meeting at 10 AM yesterday, presided over by Director Wu himself. Those present included Gu Bingyuan, director of the Economic Administration Department; Zhang Chude, chief of the Price Management Section; Cheng Yikuan of the Police Bureau; Ling Xuyou and Wang Zhenhuan of the Health Bureau; and those in charge of various industries such as fruits, local products, department stores, global department stores, beef and mutton, fresh pork, chicken and duck, fish, vegetables, and soy sauce. Director Wu declared that the central government is determined to suppress prices this time and ordered the Social, Police, Finance, and Health Bureaus to jointly implement it. He instructed the various industries to immediately reduce the raised prices from today and all to convert them to gold yuan coupons according to the prices of August 19th. The Social Bureau will announce the standards for various prices in various markets today. Those who exceed the limit will be severely punished. Those with serious circumstances will be transferred to the special criminal court for strict handling.

### Social Bureau Pays Attention to Pork Prices

During yesterday's meeting, according to a report by a representative of the pig slaughtering industry, the wholesale price on the 19th was 1.8 million to 1.9 million yuan per catty, and the current price is 1.9 million to 2.1 million yuan. As for the retail price exceeding 3 million yuan, the retailer should be responsible. However, after the representative finished reporting, Zhang, the chief of the Social Bureau, pointed out that the wholesale price on the 19th was not 1.9 million yuan, but only 1.4 million yuan. A representative of the Finance Bureau also proved that the bureau collected taxes based on 1.6 million yuan. Therefore, the market price of 1.9 million yuan on the 19th was already problematic. And retailers raising the price to 3 million yuan is an illegal profit, and the Social Bureau is paying close attention to this.

The Social Bureau is scheduled to convene the persons in charge of the ice-fresh, fresh fish, sea cucumber transportation and sales industries and the vendors' associations tomorrow morning to give instructions on price issues.

Furthermore, after sending representatives to the Social Bureau's price review meeting yesterday, the Fish Market decided to notify relevant parties in the fish industry to earnestly comply with government regulations, and all fish sales must not exceed the prices of August 19th, and to investigate and list the transaction prices of various types of fish in the market on that day for unified compliance.

Before the central government has clear regulations, the association will continue to prepare to print and issue purchase certificates for September.

### First Complaint; Citizen Reports to City Council; Mao Da Long Illegally Raises Prices

It is reported that the shop sells White Pagoda brand cream produced by Shanghai Asian Cheese Company. On the 19th, it originally sold for 10 million yuan in legal tender per pound. After the issuance of gold yuan coupons, it suddenly raised the price to 4 yuan per pound in gold yuan coupons.

### Municipal Government Budget; Discuss Revising; Seeking to Make Up for Municipal Financial Deficit; Possible Increase in House Tax and Land Tax

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Government Accounting Office convened a meeting of the secretaries, directors, and accounting directors of the Municipal Government Bureaus and Departments at 10 AM yesterday to discuss the principles of revising the budget. The meeting was presided over by Min Xiangfan, director of the Accounting Office. The resolutions made at the meeting were: (1) When the bureaus and departments prepare the budget from September 1st to December 31st, all business expenses should be converted into gold yuan coupons according to the original amount, with the principle that the original amount should not be exceeded. Therefore, it is actually a revision of the budget rather than a re-compilation. (2) Employee salaries and allowances will be prepared in accordance with the regulations of the central government, but the number of personnel will not be increased. The principles for employee office expenses were agreed upon as follows: 3 yuan in gold yuan coupons for staff, 3 jiao for workers. Special office expenses will be decided at the Municipal Administration Meeting. (3) Revenue departments will also be revised at the same time.

### Mayor's Fury; Gauze Prices Fluctuate Again; Orders Submission of Transaction Records for Review

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday, the various industries and markets were generally stable, but the price of cotton yarn and cloth increased by more than 15% compared to the previous day. After hearing this, Mayor Wu was furious and telegraphed Police Chief Yu Shuping at 5:30 PM, ordering him to immediately summon the chairmen of the two industry associations, Tang Zhiliang and Dong Jiufeng, to state the reasons for the increase and order them to submit all the transaction records of the brokers of the two industries yesterday for investigation of the buyers. If price increases or speculative manipulation are found, they will be severely punished.

### Standards · Strive for · Fairness

After the Municipal Government revised the budget, the wages and salaries of employees increased in accordance with central government regulations, resulting in a monthly shortfall of 2 million yuan. Therefore, a detailed study is being carried out on increasing tax rates to balance revenue and expenditure. According to Director Tian of the Finance Bureau, the current house tax is extremely low. If converted into gold yuan coupons, it is still less than one fen, which is indeed unreasonable. Therefore, it may be appropriately increased, but it is currently under consideration and has not yet been decided. When the reporter asked what the standard would be if the house tax were increased, he replied that it would be done as fairly as possible. It was found that the house tax during the former Public Works Bureau era adopted a valuation system, with taxes ranging from approximately 15% to 18%, while the central government's regulations stipulated 20%, which is even higher. Therefore, it would be fairer to refer to the era of the former Public Works Bureau. However, Director Tian stated that no decision has been made yet and that it must be submitted to the Municipal Administration Meeting this Friday for discussion and decision.

The Peking Opera Association hopes that when inviting famous actors to perform, the ticket prices can be reasonably adjusted. The Social Bureau agreed to handle it after approval. The person in charge of the Film Industry Association was also summoned to the Social Bureau yesterday and agreed to convert to gold yuan coupons according to the prices of August 19th, rounding off the fractions.

### Storing One Month's Worth of Ship Coal; Ministry of Industry and Commerce Orders Review

[Our Newspaper's Report, Nanjing, 24th] The National Federation of Shipping Industry Associations believes that the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee has been revoked, and the supply of coal for ships should be planned in advance to avoid the shortage of coal supply. The suggestions are: (1) Store 20,000 tons of ship coal for one month; (2) The required coal price is 1.7 trillion yuan, and request the knowledge of the Four Joint Offices to provide national policy loans. Based on this, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has ordered the Shanghai District Fuel Management Committee to quickly review the matter of storing 20,000 tons of ship coal for one month. As for the required coal price of 1.7 trillion yuan, if the review shows it is necessary, the request should be approved, and a document has been submitted to the Executive Yuan to transfer the decision to the Four Joint Offices for handling, so as to facilitate coal storage.

### Supporting the New Currency and Eradicating Communist Spies: All Sectors Hold a Propaganda Rally

The propaganda rally of all sectors in the city supporting the government's currency reform and eradicating communist spies was held at the Tianchan Stage yesterday at 9:30 AM. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Fang Zhi, Yu Hongjun (represented by Fan Heyan), Zhang Fang, Shu Yunzhang, Xu Jiqing, Youth Party city party representative Yu Kang, guests from all walks of life, and over two thousand citizens attended. Mayor Wu, as chairman of the presidium, delivered an impromptu speech, briefly stating: "The people's suffering during the War of Resistance against Japan and the period of suppressing the communist rebellion stems from inflation, especially recently. In view of this, the government, in order to solve the people's livelihood and stability, resolutely reformed the currency system before the communist rebellion was completely quelled, with the aim of alleviating the people's suffering as soon as possible. The characteristics of this currency reform are: (1) The gold yuan has full reserves, and the people can completely trust it. (2) All regulations are extremely clear, and there is a fixed exchange rate. Therefore, we hope that citizens holding gold, silver, and foreign currency will quickly exchange them. Those who fail to do so will be punished by law. At the same time, we hope that all sectors of industry and commerce will assist the government in suppressing prices and stabilizing the people's livelihood."

To Stabilize Prices, Currency Reform Is Essential

After Mr. Wu finished his speech, Liang Ying, Zhang Lu, Jenny Danny, Li Xueying, Zhang Ming, Xiao Lu, Bai Ying, Mei Qi, Zhou Lihua, Xiao Pu, Zheng Yun, Pei Lan, and Pan Qihua, fourteen female singers from the city who had recently flown to the Xuzhou area to慰劳 the air force, sang a self-composed song called "Supporting the Government's Currency Reform and Eradicating Communist Spies", modeled after the song "Welcoming Warriors." Then, Fan Heyan, representing President Yu of the National Bank, delivered a speech, clarifying the government's decision to reform the currency system. Mr. Fan said, "To stabilize the people's livelihood, we must stabilize prices. To stabilize prices, we must reform the currency system. Only in this way can fiscal revenue and expenditure be balanced, and inflation can be avoided." Finally, Mr. Fan gave a detailed explanation and description of the essence and characteristics of the four measures of the new plan.

Disrupting Social Order Is No Different from Aiding the Communists

Speaker Pan, in his speech, considered the communists and the selfish nouveau riche to be "our common enemies. Because the actions of the selfish and self-serving are disrupting the financial system and destroying social order, which is no different from aiding the communists, we should thoroughly eradicate them and cannot coexist with them." Mr. Pan also cited Tito of Yugoslavia as evidence, hoping that citizens would assist the government in reporting hidden communist spies within their own occupations, residences, and living circles, so that citizens can live and work in peace and contentment due to social stability. Mr. Pan continued, "Prices can be lowered, but the key lies in our hearts. The government's new economic plan is the key to unlocking this. If we can trust the gold yuan as if it were a material object, then the psychology of hoarding currency being better than hoarding goods can make prices fall, without a doubt."

Supporting Currency Reform Is the Only Way to Stabilize Life

Chairman Fang, in his speech, briefly stated: "Only by eradicating communist spies in the rear can we eliminate the communist conspiracy; by helping the front lines to suppress the communists, we can stabilize the social order in our rear; only by supporting the government's currency reform and complying with all laws and regulations can we stabilize life, stabilize the financial system, eliminate communist bandits, engage in construction, and revive the nation." Subsequently, Yu Kang, representative of the Youth Party city party, and Zhang Fang, head of the Central Plains慰劳 Delegation, delivered speeches. After the speeches, Chairman Fang, on behalf of the National慰劳 Headquarters, awarded commemorative medals to the慰劳ing singers. The assembly also passed the "Shanghai All Sectors Supporting the Government's Currency Reform and Eradicating Communist Spies Telegram" and the "Shanghai All Sectors' Dedication of慰劳ing Words to the Central Plains Soldiers." The proceedings of yesterday's meeting were broadcast by all radio stations in the city, and China Film Studio sent personnel to the venue to film newsreels. The meeting adjourned at approximately 12:00 PM.

### Illegal Cotton Yarn Transactions Off-Exchange: Two Brokers Publicly Prosecuted; Clients Entrusting Sales Also Indicted

[Reported by This Newspaper] Zhang Xinggen and Xu Yuesheng, two cotton yarn brokers who were arrested by the Garrison Command for engaging in off-exchange transactions, were previously paraded through the streets with their crimes written on wooden signs and escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The case has now been concluded after several investigations by the District Prosecutor's Office. According to Zhang's confession: On June 29, he was entrusted off-market to twice sell 21-count Shuangma cotton yarn for Tang Yuanjie, manager of Yongle Cloth Factory, to Feng Chaoheng, manager of Hengfeng Yarn Company.

### Pan Chaoying and Others Return to Shanghai

Discussing the Serious Confrontation Between North and South Korea

They returned to the country on a Northwest Airlines flight yesterday morning, arriving in Shanghai at about 1:00 PM. Mr. Pan is scheduled to fly to Guangzhou this morning for official business. Mr. Wang will return to Beijing today. This reporter interviewed Mr. Pan at his residence last night, and he talked about his impressions of this trip, saying: "The Korean people and the government place extremely high expectations on our country. The most noteworthy thing at present is that the North Korean communists have established close ties with the Northeast communists in our country. Among the Northeast communists, 60,000 to 70,000 Korean communists are participating in the war, and within North Korea, 40,000 to 50,000 armed Chinese communists have infiltrated. The confrontation between North and South Korea is becoming increasingly serious, and there is a possibility of internal turmoil after three months. However, everything still depends on the United Nations General Assembly's handling of the Korean issue. North Korean youths are actively launching anti-communist movements. Recently, 50,000 to 60,000 members of the North Korean 'Communist Youth League' fled to South Korea and established the 'Northwest Youth League' to carry out anti-communist propaganda and actions. The South Korean people do not have any ill feelings towards the US military, but because the US military inevitably has racial discrimination towards Koreans, it has also aroused dissatisfaction among Koreans."

### Murder Case in the Yarn and Cloth Building: Servant of a Company Dies from Fists

[Reported by This Newspaper] Zhu Huagou, from Chongming, worked as a servant in a certain company on the second floor of the Yarn and Cloth Building at 260 Zhongzheng East Road. His fellow villager Zhu Yuhuihua came to Shanghai from his hometown to visit him a few days ago.

### Robbery on Zhongzheng East Road Solved in Eleven Hours; Suspects Arrested and Loot Recovered Based on Clues from Dismissed Maid

[Reported by This Newspaper] At 3:00 AM the day before yesterday, four robbers broke into the home of Chen Li Lanying, 46 years old, a Ningbo native, housewife of the Damei Flooring Company at 139 Zhongzheng East Road. Two of them were armed with guns and broke into the bedroom on the second floor, robbing two large gold bars, three small bars, one jade bracelet, one jade phoenix, one yellow diamond ring, one white diamond ring, and other jewelry such as gold square rings, wire rings, and ruby rings, estimated to be worth over 10,000 gold yuan. The case was reported to the Huangpu Police Branch for investigation. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper.

After questioning the victim in detail, it was discovered that Zhang Fang Aying, a maid who had been dismissed earlier, had visited the victim's home a few days before the incident and was highly suspected. She was immediately taken to the bureau for strict interrogation, but the maid vehemently denied it. However, according to the victim's report: It was said that one of the four bandits had a Shandong accent, and according to Aying's confession, her sister-in-law Zhou Zhifang had a friend from Shandong, which was suspicious. The police then found Zhou's residence at a certain number on the second floor of Lane 628, Henan Middle Road, and dispatched officers to the location. Zhou was out at the time, and his wife Zhou Fang Afang lost her composure when she saw the police. Upon searching, a Mauser pistol, seven bullets, two large gold bars, and jewelry were found under the bed. Afang was immediately arrested for strict interrogation, and officers were stationed to guard the location. Before long, Zhou's daughter was heard calling "Uncle," and the officers on guard realized that a man had arrived and immediately arrested him and brought him to the bureau for strict interrogation. It was then revealed that the man was the main culprit in the robbery, named Zhang Shoutang, 28 years old, from Hangzhou, residing at No. 14, Lane 803, North Sichuan Road. Based on his confession, another large gold bar and diamond and gold rings were found.

Another accomplice, soldier Kong Fanjie, was arrested at 68 Fuxing East Road. Based on his confession, another Mauser gun and five bullets were found in the toilet of Zhou Fang Afang's home. Another accomplice, Huang Xinchang, is still at large, and the police branch is continuing to pursue him. The group of criminals is scheduled to be transferred to the court for investigation today. The fact that this robbery was solved in eleven hours can be said to be fast.

### Soul Killed Under Train Wheels at Train Station; Male Passenger Heading to Xin Zhuang Trampled to Death Crossing Tracks

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Kaixuan train departed from the North Station at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Shortly after leaving the platform, a trainman suddenly discovered that a male passenger had been crushed to death by the train and immediately stopped the train to handle the situation.

### Smilingly Welcome Golden Yuan, Angrily Drive Away Red Demons: A Look at Jiangsu in Transformation

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Fang Canglang

[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 23rd Dispatch] The emergency decree on financial and economic measures has been promulgated. This timely and wise decision has immediately presented the suffering Jiangsu compatriots, who have endured natural disasters and banditry, with a vision of stability, brightness, peace, and happiness. This good news has brought immeasurable joy to the refugees in Zhenjiang who can only afford a small portion of rice each day. Because the good dream they have been hoping for day and night—earning just ten or eight dollars to return home and farm—is about to come true. So, on this 23rd day, the refugees in Zhenjiang have mostly rushed to exchange their gold earrings, silver rings, and other valuables, which weigh only a few fractions of an ounce, for Golden Yuan. This phenomenon is comprehensive and universal throughout Jiangsu today. However, in the lines to exchange currency for coupons, refugees are often at the front. This phenomenon is enough to show that the refugees, who are unwilling to coexist with the communists, wholeheartedly and sincerely face the Golden Yuan and trample on the red demons, expecting a new situation of comprehensive military, political, and economic reform to shorten these unspeakable days of suffering, in order to seek a glimmer of hope for survival. In fact, except for the communists who dream of overthrowing the government with armed rebellion and economic plundering, and those leftist opportunists who act as accomplices for the bandits and call themselves the "middle route," every Chinese is preparing to welcome this stability, brightness, peace, and happiness, to jointly seek a way to survive. At this time, even if my advance report on the "Jiangsu in Transformation" is only a glimpse, I believe readers will certainly be happy to listen.

Unified Military Command in Northern Jiangsu, Remnant Bandits and Local Communists Collapse Together

Among the 63 counties and cities and one administrative bureau in Jiangsu, 38 belong to Northern Jiangsu. From the perspective of politics, military value, and geographical situation, its importance is self-evident. Moreover, the various yields of salt, cotton, wheat, rice, sorghum, corn, livestock, poultry, and aquatic products in this vast area, if not affected by natural disasters and banditry, should be worth more than 500 million US dollars. Therefore, after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the communists infiltrated this fertile area that could nurture millions of soldiers, and refused to give up. In terms of time, the communists have been entrenched in Northern Jiangsu for more than ten years, which cannot be said to be short. In terms of space, in this vast and fertile land, except for some important points and lines that have been recovered by the National Army, most of the vast and fertile land is still in the clutches of the remnant bandits and local communists, becoming increasingly desolate. The military authorities and the government are well aware of this serious situation. Therefore, in addition to the General Headquarters of the Army stationed in Xuzhou, there are also Pacification Zone Headquarters in Nantong and Huaiyin, conducting zonal suppression in order to specialize in success. In addition, heavy troops are stationed in Taixian, Jiangdu, and Donghai, with command organizations set up to direct and coordinate the attacks on the bandits. In the past, the military deployment was so thorough that the so-called five major prefectures of Northern Jiangsu (Xu, Hai, Huai, Yang, Tong) should have been as solid as a rock, and the evil atmosphere in the vast land of Northern Jiangsu should have been cleared up and restored to its past prosperity long ago. However, the development of things is never as simple as ideal. After sawing for two years, it is necessary to reorganize and merge into one Pacification Zone to unify the command of military suppression, in order to carry out comprehensive pacification work and complete the great task of bandit suppression. It is believed that this is indeed a smart way to save manpower, financial resources, and materials, and is suitable for the implementation of total war. In the future, the National Army will not only be able to effectively control the important points and lines in Northern Jiangsu, but also, due to the increased power of military stability, may enable the sweeping work of the area to be launched as soon as possible. However, judging from the current bandit situation, if two more reinforced divisions and four or five mobile and brave commando units can be transferred to Northern Jiangsu in the short term, then the remnant bandits and local communists will inevitably collapse and perish under this wise decision of unified command. At present, it is especially important to strengthen local teams and self-defense forces, and to strengthen the work of anti-espionage and elimination of traitors in rural towns and villages. Because the National Army cannot set up defenses in every county and station troops in every village, after the National Army defeats the remnant bandits and sweeps away the local communists, the local government must bear the important responsibility of pacifying the remaining evils and eradicating the root of the disaster. In addition to hoping to increase the number of elite troops, we also hope that the government will find ways to encourage wealthy and capable good people to return to their hometowns to organize self-defense forces and assist the National Army in carrying out the sweeping work of the area. The methods of encouragement are nothing more than: (1) Effectively guarantee the safety of the property of these wealthy and capable good people, and do not arbitrarily regard them as targets for extortion and apportionment, so that they can rest assured in their work of self-defense and defending their hometown. (2) Give the children of these people better opportunities for education, to satisfy their three wishes of defending the country, defending their hometown, and defending their family. In addition, if the selection of the county magistrate and the district and township chiefs can be properly arranged in accordance with local conditions, in accordance with the people, and in accordance with the times, without perfunctoriness, it would be even better. In short, in order to facilitate the fight against bandits, the methods of using people and money must be changed, and must become more appropriate.

Rumors of Provincial Government Reorganization, Hope for Reform and Emphasis on Changing People

Amidst the continuous calls for reform in party affairs, military affairs, finance, and economy, new news of the reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Government has been constantly spreading in recent weeks. Undoubtedly, this suffering Jiangsu is about to turn the old into the new and the bad into the good. If it is said that Wang goes and Ding comes, not only does Chairman Wang Gong, who has experienced many ups and downs in his official career, is becoming increasingly enlightened, and wants to do a good job but is troubled by his lack of ability, listen to it indifferently (please refer to this newspaper's Zhenjiang dispatch on the 23rd), but even the sensitive and argumentative people of Jiangsu also feel that it is a normal matter, because even the cabinet is reorganized after the president takes office, let alone the government of a province. Some people say that this time it will definitely be reorganized, the new master should be General Ding Zhipan, the new Secretary-General is Wang Gongyu, and the new provincial committee members who also serve as directors of departments are Wang Baoxuan (Construction), Ge Jianshi (Civil Affairs), Gu Zhuhong (Finance), and Xu Quan (Social Affairs). Some people also say that Yu Jimin will come together, and Ban Jianchu will also be invited. At the same time, some people also say that this time it may be the same as last time, just talking about it and will not be reorganized. In fact, these are all guesses. It is good to guess correctly, and it will not be a big deal if you guess wrong, anyway, it has nothing to do with the guesser. At this time, a more profound saying is: the current provincial government is stepping up the implementation of the Program for Suppressing Rebellion and Implementing Administration, and has also sent three groups of supervisory teams led by senior officials to various counties to supervise and assess the work very conscientiously. The central government may give the current provincial government a final opportunity to work hard to see the effect. In fact, this statement is just talk, but to this day, the enlightened officials and the common people in all provinces of China hope that the suppression of rebellion will be successful as soon as possible so that everyone can have a good life. To achieve this goal, from the central government to the local governments, everything must be new all the time and change at every moment, and good methods must be changed to reduce the suffering of the people. Old people using old methods are certainly not good, but new people using old methods are just going backward. The best way is to use new policies to establish a new style of administration.

### Survey Notes on the Crash Repair Project of the Xin-Jiao Branch Line

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Ling Songshou

[This Newspaper, Xiuwu, 16th Air Mail] Railroads and coal are inseparable. The Xinxiang section of the Pinghan Line is maintaining traffic in a harsh environment. The first problem is coal.

When this reporter went from Xinxiang to Xiuwu that day, Xinxiang Station still had ten tons of coal, which was only enough for one passenger train departing from Xinxiang to Zhengzhou the next day. The coal for the third day had to wait for transportation from Zhengzhou, but how much did Zhengzhou have? In order to solve this problem, the Xin-Jiao branch line was started for crash repair on July 29th, half a year after the foundation was laid.

Crash Repair Plan

Was first proposed by the Jiaozuo Zhongfu Coal Mine Company. Since the Xin-Jiao Line was destroyed last year, the Qin River was breached by the communists, and highway transportation was also cut off, Jiaozuo became an isolated island. For more than a year, the mine has been struggling in poverty. In order to prevent this domestic coal mine from stopping production, it must rely on the restoration of transportation. However, the company's proposal for crash repair is not entirely for the mine itself. The price of coal in Jiaozuo is only 18 million per ton, while in Xinxiang it has been sold for 200 million. Under this abnormal state, the common people in Xinxiang and Zhengci have long been complaining.

More than 20 kilometers west of Xinxiang have not been damaged, and it has taken a lot of effort to collect the materials needed for the remaining less than 40 kilometers.

60,000 sleepers are needed, which is simply an unacceptable burden for the railway bureau. When things are desperate, there will be change, and change will lead to success. When there is no way,

Think of a way

This method is to have the fourth district commissioner's office order the county governments of Boai, Xiuwu, Wuzhi, Xinxiang, and Ji County to borrow sleepers from the people. After the Xin-Jiao Line is repaired, the Zhongfu Coal Mine Company will use the coal produced to be transported free of charge by the Pinghan Road to Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng and other places for sale. The company will only take the profits from the factory price to repay the wood money. The price of each sleeper is 2.4 million yuan. After the sleeper problem is solved, there are no other difficulties in the remaining materials. Rails can be used piecemeal, spikes can be made by themselves, and splints can be temporarily replaced by cutting down light rails. Fortunately, in times of emergency, there is only emergency response. The director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau said well: "First seek its passage, then seek its preparation." What problem is more important to the railway itself than passage?

This reporter boarded a material car from Xinxiang to the crash repair site! There are many people who take the car to the Lion Camp to transfer to Xiuwu and Jiaozuo. The railway side started selling tickets, and the ticket price is 160,000. The ticket inspector is carrying four railway policemen, and is conscientiously performing his work. And the ticket price collected by this train is only 6 million yuan in total. They said: "There are too many soldiers."

### Fragrant Pears, Beautiful Melons, Magnificent Mountains and Rivers: A Glimpse of the "Melon and Fruit City" Orchard

— This Newspaper Reporter, Song Lin

[This Newspaper, Lanzhou, 17th Air Mail] "Dali is the garden of China, and Lanzhou is the orchard of China." Henry Wallace, the leader of the Third Party of the United States and the presidential candidate this year, also added the crown of "Melon and Fruit City" to Lanzhou when he passed through Lanzhou several years ago. In his "Northwest Travelogue" poems, President Yu (Youren) vividly described his love for melons and fruits. Just picking two sentences: "Fragrant pears, beautiful melons, magnificent mountains and rivers," and "Icy snow and soft children's fragrance," is enough to make people yearn for.

Lanzhou's melons have the most varieties in the country. In addition to the general cantaloupe, cucumber, loofah, pumpkin, winter melon, pumpkin, etc., the watermelon and drunken melon, Wallace melon, produced are especially famous.

Each Watermelon Weighs Forty Catties

The watermelons are large and sweet. A normal one can weigh 30 to 40 catties. The melon season is from June to September every year, but if they are properly stored in cellars, there are still opportunities to enjoy them in the cold winter, so there is a proverb: "Eating watermelon while holding a stove." The varieties of watermelons are divided into white skin, black skin, and flower skin according to the skin color. According to the melon pulp, there are yellow pulp and red pulp. Except for variants, white skin and black skin are mostly yellow pulp, and flower skin are mostly red pulp. Watermelons are mostly planted in the sandy fields on both sides of the upper reaches of the Yellow River in Lanzhou. Seeds are sown in early spring every year. Each mound of land (about 2.5 mu) can plant 600 to 700 plants, with a row spacing of about 6 shichi and a plant spacing of about 1.5 cun. Each mound of land is fertilized with more than 1,000 catties. Watermelons are most afraid of irrigation. Except for prolonged drought and no rain, when it is absolutely necessary, water is poured in moderation. If the amount of water is slightly more, the sugar content of the melon will be reduced, and the quality will also deteriorate. Therefore, this is also the reason why melons must be planted in sandy fields. (Sandy fields can absorb and contain water in large quantities, and can resist alkali). The cultivation of watermelons is hard work. Its owner will be anxious for it due to a gust of wind or rain, and cover it with a pottery to shield it from the wind and rain. After it has grown for more than 110-120 days, it will be picked and smoothly transported down the Yellow River on a sheepskin raft to the Leitang River melon market to be sold.

Flower Skin Varieties Are the Most Famous

Watermelons are mostly oval. White skins are the first to market, flower skins are the most famous watermelons in Lanzhou, and the output is also large. Its market is the peak of the melon season. Black skin is a late-maturing variety, which is marketed in early August every year. Of the above three types, in terms of quality, flower skin is the best, black skin is the second best, and white skin is the worst. In terms of economic value, white skin has the benefit of early market, but if the three are on the market at the same time, the price of black skin is the highest, flower skin is the second highest, and white skin is far behind. Due to the inconvenience of transportation, watermelons, drunken melons, etc. produced in various places are mostly only for local sales. As for the interests of melon farmers, according to a rough survey, planting melons on each mound of land can obtain a net profit of more than 70%, which is much more profitable than cultivating other crops. This is also the main reason for the prosperity of Lanzhou's melons.

Specialty Drunken Claws Are Famous Throughout the Country

Drunken melon is a real Lanzhou specialty, famous throughout the country. Because it is only produced in Miaotanzi and Donggang Town in the suburbs of Lanzhou, the output is relatively small, and it is "rare is precious." It is said that there are also varieties of drunken melon in Japan and the United States, called musk melon. In Southeast Asia, noble ladies can only taste a little bit when eating Western pastries. (All canned) And in Lanzhou, each one currently sells for only 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. In every flight, it is carried to Ping, Jin, Jing, Hu, and Han as valuable gifts for people to taste lightly. Don't look at its small body and rough skin, and some cracked-like stripes on the outside, but when you open it, the pulp is thick and juicy, and it is sweet and mellow when you eat it. It is the head of the ladies in the melon and fruit industry, and it is the most popular!

Wallace Melon Trial Planting Is Excellent

Another type of melon that tastes similar to drunken melon is called "Wallace Melon." It is a famous variety from Ukraine (or the United States, according to one theory) that Wallace gave when he came to Lanzhou. It has been tried to be planted in Lanzhou for several years, and the results are excellent. In the past two years, in terms of output, it almost overwhelmed everything and dominated the market. It's just that the annual cycle is unfavorable this year, and the output has been sharply reduced by about 30%. The skin of the Wallace melon is a smooth, light yellow color, and the pulp is similar to that of the drunken melon, but the sugar content is too much, and the water content is ultimately not as suitable as that of the drunken melon. A good drunken melon has a pungent aroma of wine, which Wallace melon and Hami melon cannot compete with.

Hami melon is a seed that was moved from Hami. After many years of trial planting, it is always not as good as the original place of origin, and it cannot be made into melon jerky. In recent years, the output has been replaced by Wallace melon.

Drunken melon, Wallace melon, and Hami melon are all planted in sandy fields. The cultivation method is roughly the same as that of watermelon, and the hard work is even more. There is also a seed melon, which is smaller in shape than watermelon, has many seeds and thin skin, and is specially taken for seeds. The Lanzhou area can produce 242,200 catties of melon seeds every year, which are roasted all year round for leisure needs.

Pear Fruits Are Plump and Can Be Stored for a Long Time

Speaking of Lanzhou's fruits, the most famous and the saltiest in production is pears. There are many varieties of pears, and some are genuine specialties. Although no one has accurately investigated the exact output, because pears are resistant to storage, and the Lanzhou climate is also suitable for the storage of fruits, so all year round, they can always be found in the market, becoming the most consumed fresh fruit. Its status in Lanzhou can be compared to that of citrus in the south.

Soft Pear and Other Types Are the Most Produced

There are roughly the following types of pears: (1) Long Handle Pear: Marketed in August, the skin is light brown, each weighs about 2-3 taels, the flesh is white and slightly hard, the taste is slightly sour, and it is not considered a good product. (2) Crispy Wood Pear: Marketed in Mid-Autumn Festival, the skin is light yellow, the flesh is white and crispy, each weighs about 3-4 taels, and the quality is better than the former. (3) Woli Pear: Marketed after Mid-Autumn Festival, the skin is yellow-green, the flesh is fine and astringent, and it can only be eaten after being stored until the flesh becomes soft. (4) Soft Pear: It is the most produced and most famous specialty in Lanzhou. It matures in mid-October, each weighs about 4-5 taels, the skin is light yellow and tastes astringent, and the flesh contains sand grains, so it is not suitable for eating raw. It must be stored in a cellar until the severe winter, when it freezes hard and turns black, and then immersed in cool water to soften it. Peel and suck the flesh and water, which is chilly, fragrant and sweet. People who come to Lanzhou for the first time see that the fruit skin is full of dust and as hard as iron eggs, and they simply don't dare to ask. After eating it once or twice, most people will be addicted to it. (5) Diaodanzi: Shaped like a pigeon egg, weighing about 1 tael. When it is first picked, it is light brown and tastes very astringent. It must be stored like a soft pear until after the New Year, when it turns black and soft, and is marketed in strings, like eating grapes, one bite at a time, with a special flavor. (6) Winter Fruit Pear: It is the most famous pear in Lanzhou, and its output is second only to soft pears, but it is the only fresh fruit in winter. It begins to mature in November and is most suitable for storage. It can still be seen for sale in May and June of the following year. The skin is yellow-green, with thick and thin distinctions, the flesh is white, fine and crisp, the juice is very abundant, the sweet and sour is moderate, and it is no less than the Yazi pear in North China. It can be eaten raw after picking. After storage, the taste is even more beautiful, and it is especially delicious when cooked. The hot winter fruit in Lanzhou winter night is indeed a top-quality product.

Peaches, Plums, Apricots, and Dates Have Their Own Merits

In addition, peaches, plums, apricots, dates, cherries, persimmons, walnuts, apples, shaju, red qin, grapes, ... are all cultivated. Not only do they have different shapes, but they also have their own merits. Especially peaches, apricots, and apples, which have a large output and delicious taste. The price is even cheaper. Every year after autumn, various fruits are launched on the market one after another. The streets and alleys are colorful and cluttered, and the shouts of vendors resound through the clouds. It is the most prosperous season for the melon and fruit city.

Dried Fruits Exported in Alarming Numbers

The orchards and melon fields near Lanzhou are everywhere. In summer, the fruits grow, and the branches cannot bear the weight. They are supplemented with high poles and fine ropes, so that they can develop at will and become beautiful fruits with abundant harvests. Although there are no accurate statistics on the annual output of these melons and fruits, they are all eaten or made into dried fruits, which are sold to other places. It is said that the annual output of dried fruits reaches 1,272,500 catties, and sweet apricot kernels reach 35,000 catties, and the annual export reaches 250,000 catties.

The cultivation methods in the melon and fruit city have remained the same for hundreds of years. Although the Gansu Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute is in Lanzhou, it can only do some improved experimental work. The prosperity of the "Chinese Orchard" still has to undergo a scientific baptism.

### After the Suspension of Operations at the Securities Exchange, All Transactions Were Cleared; The Exchange Advised Brokers Not to Engage in Illegal Transactions

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the Shanghai Securities Exchange, following orders, suspended operations from August 20th, it stipulated that all transactions completed by brokers should be settled clearly within the 23rd and 24th. It is learned that the total transaction amount of all brokers reached over 24 million Gold Yuan (originally over 729 trillion Legal Tender), all of which have been settled clearly in accordance with regulations. Our reporter recently interviewed Mr. Wang Zhixin, the General Manager of the Exchange, who stated that it was gratifying that such a large amount of settlements were completed by all brokers within two days. He also stated that he believes that this suspension of operations, ordered by the Exchange, is not only a necessary measure for the government's implementation of emergency financial and economic measures, but also beneficial to the future business of all brokers. In the future, when the government promotes public debt policies, consolidates issuance reserves, and guides funds previously stagnant in gold notes into productive construction channels, the mission of the Exchange will become even more important. As for private gold businesses, in order to cooperate with national policies and promote production, their source of funds will especially require the assistance of exchange institutions. Therefore, when the time is right, the government will certainly allow the Exchange to resume operations quickly. It is hoped that all brokers will strictly abide by laws and regulations, conduct strict self-examination, and not engage in illegal trading activities, so as to avoid attracting criticism and affecting the date of resumption. The Exchange has also sent a circular to all brokers to this effect, urging them not to engage in illegal trading activities during the suspension period of the Exchange, so as not to affect the date of resumption.

The Shanghai Securities Exchange Brokers Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the 24th. All directors and supervisors attended, with Chairman Wang Li-Shi-Chang Nai-Xu presiding. They discussed association affairs after the ordered suspension of operations and decided to convene a temporary membership meeting on the 26th of this month. They also notified all brokers that, before being ordered to resume operations, they should strictly abide by regulations and completely cease engaging in securities trading on behalf of customers.

### Urgent Notice from the Yarn Industry Association: Yarn Sales Must Not Exceed the Price Limit

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Yarn Industry Association posted an urgent notice in the market yesterday, stating that on August 20th, the government promulgated Article 13 of the "Measures for Strengthening Economic Control," which stated; "The prices of all commodities and labor services throughout the country should be sold by converting the prices of various commodities in each region on August 19th, 1948, into Gold Yuan according to the exchange rate, and the local competent authorities should strictly supervise and implement this." Article 14 of the same measures stated: "After converting the prices of various commodities and labor services into Gold Yuan according to the previous article, the regulations prohibiting price violations and bargaining should be strictly enforced, and price increases are not allowed unless approved by the competent authorities for special reasons." Now, the prices of various cotton yarns in this city on August 19th are converted into Gold Yuan and listed below. All cotton yarn transactions in this city market should be based on the listed prices and must not exceed them. In addition to the Market Management Committee of this association carrying out strict supervision at all times, it is hoped that all members will not deliberately violate the law, so as not to fall into the legal net, which is of utmost importance.

### Slack Yarn Market Trading

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were characterized by relaxed credit for businesses, manufacturers' reduced willingness to sell, and a rally in buying sentiment from Shanghai merchants and customers from Tianjin, Guangdong, Hankou, and other regions, as confidence rebounded after the previous day's sharp decline. However, after the currency reform, in order to implement national policy and suppress price increases, the authorities were conducting strict surveillance by uniformed police personnel, and the Association had also advised the trade not to exceed the market prices of the 19th. As a result, trading was slack. However, the market opened with a somewhat vigorous atmosphere, but after the brokers were advised, they did not engage in trading beyond the price limits, and transactions were thin. Fine yarns were rarely traded; only 32s, 21s, 20s, and 10s yarns were traded in four or five varieties, and prices rose slightly by 50 to 70 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors spread that the Wealth Bureau would temporarily prohibit re-exports, and the market became confused. All parties waited quietly for the authorities to take action, and no transactions were made. There was also no price quoting outside the market.

### Cotton Cloth Rises to the Limit

The cotton cloth market saw some floating capital from the Central Bank's release of silver and gold exchange positions, and the industry's credit also eased. Generally, the market looked optimistic, and retail investors took the opportunity to raise prices for sales. Cloth merchants and dyeing factories watched, and although some in the market were selling, the buying momentum was difficult to contain.

Twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth jumped two yuan and seven jiao upon opening. As sellers continued to release goods, the market fell slightly by five jiao. Subsequently, because of outside market activity, there were more buyers. Although the Fangjian Company was distributing Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi Serge, there was still no bidding. Around 11 o'clock, news of a rise in the yarn market spread, and cloth merchants' asking prices also gradually increased, finally closing at 29 yuan and one jiao, a rebound of four yuan and one jiao compared to the previous day, about four jiao short of the price limit on the 19th. Other cloths also turned bullish, but colored cloth and Shilin cloth remained at their original prices, with 2,800 bolts transacted.

Another report: It was heard that Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi Serge rose to their limits after closing. In the afternoon, rumors spread that yarn market brokers had been arrested for quoting prices outside the market, and confidence in the industry suddenly weakened. Longtou fine cloth fell to 28 yuan and five jiao, and Sijunzi Serge also fell slightly to 27 yuan in transactions. Other cloths also saw slight declines compared to the afternoon closing.

### Silk Factories Face Difficult Circumstances; Two Suggestions Provided

The Silk Industry Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Regions previously convened a meeting of directors and supervisors to discuss remedial measures due to the difficult circumstances faced by various silk factories. After Chairman Chen Ai-Shi consulted with relevant parties, it was heard that the Assistance and Guidance Council had drafted a remedial plan, but a decision had been delayed, so various silk factories remained on the sidelines.

According to industry insiders, the problems urgently needing to be solved are: (1) Since the Technical Department of the Assistance and Guidance Council announced the reeling costs for the first half of July, it has failed to announce the reeling costs for the second half of July and the first half of August on time. Various factories feel unable to advance funds, so it is hoped that the Assistance and Guidance Council will announce the reeling costs for each period as soon as possible, so as to avoid losses to various silk factories. (2) Since the currency reform, the government has paid more attention to export commodities, and the procurement methods for various silk factories reeling raw silk on behalf of the government should be as reasonable as possible.

### Rayon Resumes Distribution; Finished Products Continue to be Auctioned This Week

The Central Trust Bureau has scheduled a rayon price negotiation meeting for 10:00 AM today and will simultaneously resume distribution to meet market demand. Furthermore, last week the Bureau auctioned various materials with a total value of 200,000 Gold Yuan. In order to cooperate with the new economic measures promulgated by the authorities, a large amount will continue to be auctioned this week. It is heard that the materials are mostly finished products purchased by the Bureau.

### After Our Currency Reform, Hong Kong is Extremely Optimistic

[Commodity Research Institute, Hong Kong, 23rd] Since our country reformed its currency system, Chinese and foreign people are all optimistic about the future of the Gold Yuan. The reasons are: (1) The government still possesses a large amount of materials, and US aid to China is arriving successively. Moreover, the government will certainly act cautiously in issuing Gold Yuan this time, and with the above materials as a backing, it can tighten credit at any time and prevent it from becoming loose and abused. (2) After the currency value is stabilized, the government's tax revenue can actually increase. (3) Overseas remittances can also greatly increase. (4) Export settlement can be strengthened after the announcement of the conversion at the new US dollar exchange rate, and the amount of settlement can also increase. All of this is sufficient to strengthen the reserves of the Gold Yuan and move towards stability. If the Gold Yuan achieves stability, then the assistance that the United States has added to our country will be further strengthened. The impact of the issuance of Gold Yuan on Hong Kong is also quite important. (1) If the Gold Yuan achieves stability, gold, US dollars, US banknotes, standard banknotes, forward banknotes, and domestic remittances in the Hong Kong financial market will all fall into a sideways state, and will not be as lively as they are now, so the banking industry will be the first to be affected. (2) If the Gold Yuan is stable, our country will definitely increase imports, then Hong Kong's trade with our country may increase. (3) Smugglers in the mainland will also be more active than before due to the stability of the finances. (4) The trend of Hong Kong dollar standards in the mainland will inevitably disappear. Few Hong Kong dollars circulating in the mainland will naturally gradually return to Hong Kong, increasing the amount of capital in the Hong Kong market. At the same time, the number of mainland funds fleeing to Hong Kong will also inevitably decrease, allowing Hong Kong to gradually restore its normal state. Its impact on Hong Kong is also quite good.

### Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency: Jianghai Customs Restricts Entry and Exit; Anything Exceeding the Specified Amount Will Be Confiscated

[Report from Our Newspaper] Jianghai Customs issued a notice yesterday, stating that it had received an order from the Director-General of Customs stating that the "Measures for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People" had been promulgated and implemented by the government. According to the provisions of the measures:

(1) Gold, silver, silver coins, and foreign currency notes are strictly prohibited from being carried out of the country. However, this restriction does not apply to gold jewelry with a total weight not exceeding two market taels, silver jewelry with a total weight not exceeding twenty market taels, or foreign currency notes for travel expenses with a certificate issued by a bank selling foreign currency notes, with a total value not exceeding US$100.

(2) Those carrying gold, silver, silver coins, gold and silver ornaments, or foreign currency notes into the country should declare them to the Customs. Except for gold jewelry with a total weight not exceeding two market taels and silver jewelry with a total weight not exceeding twenty market taels, which may be carried in personal possession, the remainder should be submitted to the Central Bank or its entrusted bank for conversion into Gold Yuan at the prescribed exchange rate. Transit or tourist travelers who, in addition to the gold and silver ornaments they are allowed to carry in personal possession according to the preceding paragraph, still need to carry all of their gold, silver, and foreign currency out of the country should declare them to the Customs upon entry and hand them over to the Central Bank or its entrusted bank for sealing and safekeeping, and retrieve the original items upon exit. However, if they have not requested the return of the items for carrying out of the country within six months after entry, they should be converted into Gold Yuan at the prescribed exchange rate.

(3) Those who violate the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) will have their gold, silver, silver coins, or foreign currency notes confiscated. Those who are discovered and confiscated due to confidential reports will be awarded 40% of the value of the confiscated items to the informant.

### Origin Prices Plummet, Confidence is Weak; Rice Prices Decline Again; Flour, Cooking Oil, and Other Items Rise Consistently

Rice prices continued to decline due to falling prices in the Xishi market, causing a great deal of market anxiety. Those who held goods felt that prices at origin had already fallen, so they also lowered prices for sales, but rice stores remained slack in accepting goods, and prices fell again. Both glutinous rice and indica rice fell by one yuan in the Nanshi market, while they fell by less than 20 yuan in the Beishi market. Special grade glutinous rice was 21 yuan and five jiao in the Beishi market, Kunshan new indica rice was 17 yuan and two jiao, and rough indica rice opened at 13 yuan including the bag. Arrivals yesterday decreased due to rain, with a total of 3,748 shi in the two markets.

Flour stopped falling and turned to rise. Because credit loosened and prices of non-industry goods rose, market sentiment strengthened, and traders and retail investors took the opportunity to acquire goods, and the market rose again. Most brands of flour exceeded seven yuan. The highest price of Lao Che flour reached seven yuan, three jiao, and five fen, closing at seven yuan and two jiao. Bingshan flour opened at six yuan and eight jiao and closed at six yuan, nine jiao, and five fen, up three jiao and three jiao and five fen respectively. Hong Feng, Jian Cheng, and other flours all opened at seven yuan, and miscellaneous brands of flour all rose three or four jiao. Bran was slightly higher.

Miscellaneous grains all turned higher. Due to the loosening of credit, customers were more willing to accept goods, and cargo owners also held back and sold. Soybeans initially rose by two jiao, but then rose again due to rising soybean cake prices, finally rising by five jiao. Corn and Yuan wheat were very popular among Qingdao merchants, rising by one yuan and five jiao. Broad beans were slightly higher, and red sorghum saw no transactions. Sesame prices were still flat, and sales were very active. Raw peanuts were quoted one yuan higher than the previous day, with Dawenkou raw peanuts closing at 33 yuan.

Cooking oil also rose again. The reasons were that credit loosened, and prices of non-industry goods rose, and the mentality of those holding goods was firm. The willingness to accept goods from merchants and retailers was also strong. Soybean oil opened at 50 yuan, and the last recycled soybean oil from Dayou was 52 yuan, reaching the price limit of August 19th. Other soybean oils were 51 yuan and five jiao, and vegetable oil closed at 46 yuan, each rising by three yuan. Raw oil also rose by three yuan, Jiton vegetable oil was 61 yuan, and small car sesame oil added one yuan. Soybean cake rose by three jiao, and Lizi cake was four yuan and three jiao.

### Credit Has Been Seen to Loosen; Banks and Bureaus Continue to Release Funds

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the second day of the issuance of Gold Yuan, and credit in the market was significantly looser than the previous day. Most financial circles had ample funds, so they were able to cope with ease. Even various industries outside the financial circle found borrowing and lending more convenient than before. The tight situation eased, and secret interest rates fell from six jiao to four jiao and five fen.

National banks and bureau treasuries continued to release 1.33 million yuan. The Central Bank released 5.11 million yuan, with 1.12 million yuan entering the big exchange, and foreign merchants released 30,000 yuan, with 240,000 yuan entering the small exchange. The Bank of China entered 80,000 yuan, the Bank of Communications entered 3.03 million yuan, the China Agricultural Bank and the China Credit Bank each entered 130,000 yuan, the Postal Remittance Bureau entered 320,000 yuan, and the Cooperative Treasury entered 90,000 yuan.

The exchange situation at the clearing house has also returned to a state of calm, and by about 5:00 PM, the settlement was completed. Yesterday, a total of 262,965 checks were exchanged, with a total exchange amount of 63,797,222,000 yuan, a large decrease compared to the previous day. The number of bounced checks on the previous day was 13,836, with an amount of 2,240,718.11 yuan. Yesterday, there were 3,950 bounced checks, with an amount of 796,403.79 yuan. The number of bounced checks and the amount also saw a sharp decrease.

### Export Settlement Figures from January to May of This Year Released

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to sources from the Export Control Commission: Although the export industry once contracted from January to May of this year due to the increasing cost of domestic products and the overly low foreign exchange rate of the National Bank, the settlement figures to designated banks over five months still reached US$91,988,138, a decrease of only 14% compared to the settlement figures of US$107,103,333 in the same period last year.

### Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee Ordered to Be Closed Down

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Bank recently received an order from the Executive Yuan: After the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures Order, the original listed market price of foreign exchange by the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee should be canceled. The Committee has also been ordered to be closed down and has now stopped accepting and delivering.

### Sales of State-Owned Enterprises: Preparation Work is Becoming More Active

Regarding the sale of state-owned enterprises, as there are explicit provisions in the new economic measures plan, the preparation work for the sale is gradually becoming more active. Chen Qi-Tian, the concurrently serving Chairman of the China Textile Construction Corporation under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, has scheduled to come to Shanghai this Saturday (28th) to preside over the 13th regular meeting of the company's board of directors, where he will give instructions on the preparatory work for the sale of the company.

### Methods for Increasing Capital of Financial Institutions: Banks and Bureaus Telegraph the Ministry of Finance for Instructions

There are no explicit provisions in the financial and economic emergency measures regarding the issue of increased capital for financial institutions. The increase in capital for state-owned banks and bureaus cannot be handled. If calculated based on the pre-war amount of 50 million yuan, converted into Gold Yuan, it would be a mere 16 yuan or so. Whether the standard for increasing capital will be calculated according to an index or if there are other regulations, instructions have been requested from the Ministry of Finance.

### Quiet Tea Market

Yesterday's tea market: The process remained quiet, and there was a lack of actual transactions. The reason is that the holders of red and green tea mostly quoted prices in Gold Yuan, which differed from the previous week. Exporters felt that there were no shipping schedules within the month, and the results of reporting to foreign countries had not yet been received, so buying sentiment was hesitant, and the trend continued to show a state of silence on both the entry and exit sides. Looking at this situation, it is feared that the situation will be difficult to improve this week.

### The Bureau of Education Convened a Meeting of Principals of Private Primary and Secondary Schools to Discuss the Issue of Tuition Fees for the Next Semester; Private Schools Advocate Not Only Hard and Fast Regulations to Restrict Schools; Opinions from All Parties Will Be Compiled and Submitted to the Mayor for Final Decision

[Report from Our Newspaper] The standards for tuition and miscellaneous fees for colleges and universities in the city have been agreed upon by the presidents of various schools, at 80 to 100 Gold Yuan. Director Li of the Municipal Bureau of Education convened the principals of various private primary and secondary schools at Yucai Middle School at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss the issue of fees. More than 150 people attended, and the meeting lasted for two and a half hours. Because the standards proposed by the principals could not approach the standards suggested by Director Li, the matter will be submitted to Mayor Wu for approval.

Explain the Philosophy of Running Schools for Education

At the beginning of the symposium, Director Li first explained the government's currency reform, so the amount of fees should be calculated in salary and currency units. He also hoped that participants in discussing this issue must bear in mind that the education sector provides education for education and runs schools to serve education. Then the discussion began. Wan Er-Xiang of the Private Primary and Secondary School Association believed that the government's current currency reform is intended to restore the situation to the pre-war situation. Before the war, the government did not restrict school fees, so he hoped that the current government would also not restrict the fees of various schools and not bind various schools with prescribed figures.

Advocate Doubling According to Pre-War Standards

In principle, the Association hopes to restore the fee figures to pre-war standards. For example, those who charged 8 yuan before the war should now charge 16 yuan, and those who charged 20 yuan before the war should now charge 40 yuan. Then a representative from the Principals Association of Private Schools in various districts spoke, all believing that the various schools are located in different areas, and the fee standards cannot be generalized. Because the residents in the suburbs are poor, the fees charged by the schools in the suburbs in the previous semester have always been lower than the standards stipulated by the government, otherwise no one will attend school, and they will have to close their doors. Therefore, it is generally believed that the government should not rigidly stipulate and restrict private school fees and that various schools can determine their own fees separately based on the actual situation of equipment. Representatives from various districts also reported the fee standards that have been set in various districts.

Hope Not to Make Rigid Regulations

Shen Tong-Yi, the principal of Nanyang Model School, continued, saying: The school's tuition and miscellaneous fees before the war were 52 yuan for high school, 42 yuan for junior high school, and 36 yuan for primary school. If calculated according to the Gold Yuan, high school should be 104 yuan, junior high school 84 yuan, and primary school 72 yuan. However, it is impossible to charge according to this standard in reality. Therefore, he hopes that the government does not rigidly regulate school fees. Cui Jian-Wu, the principal of Daozhong Women's Middle School, believed that the education business is a business of conscience, so don't haggle over every penny. She summarized the opinions of the representatives from various schools in attendance and proposed a fee range of 20 to 40 yuan for primary school, 40 to 60 yuan for junior high school, and 60 to 80 yuan for high school.

The Bureau of Education Suggests Fee Standards

At this point, Director Li stated that he himself has always advocated not imposing rigid regulations on school fees and, on the other hand, setting up more free places, taking care of the children of the poor. However, school fees must take into account the livelihood of teachers and school expenses, and must also take into account the burden on the general public, otherwise many disputes will inevitably occur. He believed that although the prices of rice and other items are now doubled according to the Gold Yuan conversion, it is not reasonable to calculate the fees according to the pre-war standard doubled. Even in terms of the treatment of public education personnel, it is still lower than before the war. Based on the Bureau of Education's calculations, he suggested that the primary school tuition and miscellaneous fee standard be 20 to 25 yuan, junior high school 35 to 45 yuan, and high school 45 to 55 yuan. The principals of various schools mostly believed that Director Li's suggestions were unacceptable, and no decision was reached, so the meeting adjourned. Director Li will combine the opinions of the principals of various schools and his suggestions and submit them to Mayor Wu for final decision.

The Director Explains the Basis of the Calculation

The basis for the Bureau of Education's calculation of fees is based on the assumption that the treatment of private school teachers is the same as that of municipal school teachers. The current average salary of junior high school teachers in municipal schools is a base salary of 280 Legal Tender, which is converted into 88 Gold Yuan after discounts. Assuming that each class has two teachers, the total monthly salary is 176 yuan. Assuming that each class has six months, the total salary is 1,056 yuan. According to the regulations, 70% is used for salary expenses and 30% is used for office expenses. The office expenses are 458 yuan. The total amount of salary and office expenses for each class for six months is 1,514 yuan. Assuming that there are 48 students per class, and deducting the 25% free places, there are 36 students. Dividing the total amount of expenditure by 36 students, the amount that each junior high school student should pay is 42 yuan. High school and primary school are also calculated according to this formula. The average salary of high school teachers is a base salary of 280 Legal Tender, and the salary of primary school teachers is 180 yuan. According to this, it can be known that the fee that each high school student should pay is 52 yuan, and the fee for primary school is more than 24 yuan.

### Director Li Sincerely Advised Private Schools to Change Their Style

[Report from Our Newspaper] Director Li of the Municipal Bureau of Education, in addition to expounding the philosophy of running schools to serve education at the meeting of principals of private primary and secondary schools to discuss the issue of fees, also made several points, sincerely advising various private schools to pay attention to: (1) The treatment of teachers in municipal schools and private schools should not differ too much. (2) Starting this semester, regardless of how much each school charges, 70% of the total revenue should be used as salaries for teachers and staff, with the principle of paying it all at once. If it is paid in installments, the surplus funds cannot be kept privately by the principal alone. A management committee should be organized jointly by the principal and representatives of teachers and staff. (3) It is hoped that the parent-teacher associations of various schools will be established as soon as possible so that they can supervise and assist the schools at any time. (4) The number of free places in various schools must be expanded as much as possible so that children from poor families can also enroll. (5) Many past bad practices should be eliminated, and the method of keeping extra funds is one example. Textbook fees cannot be forcibly collected either. (6) Schools must be responsible for conducting thorough assessments of student applications for free tuition. A small number of school teachers discriminate against or look down on free students, causing great mental pain to free students. Principals should immediately admonish this kind of "anti-education" phenomenon.

### The Middle and Small Joint Resolutions to Set Tuition Fees

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Private Middle and Elementary School Joint Council held its 43rd Board Meeting at 553 Zhongzheng Middle Road yesterday (24th) afternoon. Forty-one directors and supervisors attended, with Chief Xie of the Secondary Education Department of the Bureau of Education in attendance. After detailed discussions on tuition fees for this semester, the following resolutions were made: "Private school tuition fees shall be determined independently by each school in reference to pre-war standards. However, if the government must propose an amount for schools to use as a reference, the principles are 70 to 80 yuan for high school, 50 to 60 yuan for junior high school, and 30 to 40 yuan for elementary school." It was also resolved: (1) Teacher salaries are set at 70% of the school's total income. (2) The 25th will host attendance for those at the Training and Education Symposium.

### World Games Basketball Consolation Match; Easily Defeats Great Britain; Both Sides Display Complete Sportsmanship; Relaxed and Pleasant Throughout

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Zhong Zhen

[Our Report from London by Airmail] The track and field and swimming events of the World Games, which began on August 9th, have all come to an end, and the results of each event are not as satisfactory as expected. Most of the ball games have entered the semi-finals or finals. In the basketball round robin, a new consolation round has been created, in which several teams eliminated in the preliminary rounds compete again to arrange the rankings, so that the defeated teams can also find some consolation. Unfortunately, our team has also entered this consolation round. The day before yesterday, they first met the Swedish team and returned with a victory. Today (August 11th), they met the host of the World Games—the British team.

The game was held at the Haringey Gymnasium at 2:00 PM on August 11th (Wednesday), and there was heavy rain again. Except for the first two days after the opening ceremony, the rest of the days of this Games have been either overcast or rainy. Such inferior weather has greatly disappointed both athletes and spectators.

This game was quite unique. Both sides displayed complete sportsmanship and were relaxed and pleasant throughout. Although the British team members were all over six feet tall, their movements were indescribably sluggish. They never bravely snatched the ball, and after they got the ball, they were slow to advance. The members of our team also played calmly and easily defeated the British team with a score of 54 to 25. The members of our team repeatedly used small tricks, which left the other side at a loss and won continuous applause from the friendly spectators. The game progressed as follows:

Lineup of our team:

(Yu Ruizhang) Huang Tianxi

Wu Chengzhang Cai Wenhua (Jia Zhijun)

Li Shiqiao Bao Songyuan

Our army still fought with the same lineup as before. After the opening, Huang Tianxi fouled, and the British team scored one goal. But in an instant, Cai Wenhua scored a long shot, making it two to one. The two guards of the British team did not intercept the ball and were repeatedly penalized for free throws. Four to one, after a long melee, our team always had the upper hand, and the score difference was eight or nine points. In the first half, twenty-three to fourteen, our country took the lead. In the second half, the ground was changed and the battle was resumed. The spirit of the members of our team suddenly lifted, and the score soared. In an instant, it became twenty-seven to fourteen. The other side occasionally scored a goal, but our army immediately responded with two goals, and the score difference between the two teams increased. In the last ten minutes, it became forty-six to twenty-one. Coach Song dispatched Yu Ruizhang and Jia Zhijun to the arena, and the performance was even more exciting. The British team members had no room to operate, and the game ended with a score of fifty-four to twenty-seven. Our team won a great victory.

### Deaf and Mute Symposium; Lou Wenao Speaks; Finished 10,000 Meters and Received Commemorative Medal; Marathon Withdrew Due to Foot Pain

[Our Report] The Shanghai Deaf and Mute Association held a reception yesterday afternoon at the Youth Association for Lou Wenao, a deaf and mute general who had just returned from the World Games in England. Lou stated: I participated in both the 10,000-meter and marathon events, but unfortunately, I failed in both, which is very regrettable. As for the reasons for the failure, I will list two points: (1) I wore spiked shoes for the 10,000-meter race. During the race, the spiked shoes had a problem, and my feet were rubbed and injured, causing bleeding. I barely ran the entire course and received a commemorative medal, but I did not score. (2) I wore running shoes for the marathon, and the soles were thin. I originally wanted to buy thicker running shoes to participate in the competition, but I didn't have enough time, so I had to wear them. After starting, I was in the lead in the first half of the race, but later, because the road was uneven and my feet were injured, the pain was severe, and I had to withdraw halfway and couldn't rest. Regarding the seventh place in the 5,000 meters, I deny it. Finally, Lou Xisan encouraged the deaf and mute generals to recuperate and show their skills in the future.

### The Last Battle; Hastily Ended; Lost to Italy

At 2:00 PM on the 18th, our team faced the Italian team again in the Haringey Gymnasium to compete for the consolation championship. The Italian team's skills were not high. Based on the past performance of our team, we could have won the victory with a 90% chance, but unexpectedly, today's performance was very disappointing. The team members still had energy in the first half of the game, but after that, it was purely perfunctory. As a result, the game ended hastily. The biggest reason was that the team members were all scheduled to fly back to the country at 4:00 PM tomorrow, so they had no intention of fighting. In addition, left guard Huang Tianxi had already returned to Singapore yesterday, and the team lacked a vital force, making the formation even more lax. The poor performance of the game was unprecedented. The lineup of our team was as follows:

(Yu Ruizhang) Wu Chengzhang Li Shiqiao (Cai Zhongqiang)

Cai Wenhua

Li Zhenzhong Bao Songyuan

After the opening, our team's offense and defense were still up to standard. The Italian center was tall and had incredibly accurate turnaround shots. After Coach Song instructed our team members to mark him closely, he was at a loss. The scores of both sides gradually approached. Ten to fourteen, in the middle, our country once led with nineteen to seventeen, and in the first half, twenty-five to twenty-one, our army lost by four points.

In the second half, the field was changed and the battle was resumed. Li Zhenzhong was transferred out, and Jia Zhijun replaced him. At first, the difference between the two teams was only four or five points. In the last quarter of an hour, the fatigue of the players on our team was exposed, and the formation was unprecedentedly chaotic. Right guard Bao Songyuan took the ball alone and neglected to defend. The connection was completely lost, and the entire field was controlled by Italy. The score soared and took the lead with forty to twenty-six. Our army's deployment of troops could not reverse the overall situation, and the game ended hastily with a score of fifty-four to thirty-eight.

### Ping City Rowing Competition

Held at Beihai at the End of the Month

[Our Report from Beiping on the 24th] The Ping City Rowing Competition for the 37th year is scheduled to be held at the Five Dragon Pavilion in Beihai on the 28th and 29th. It is organized by the Municipal Education Bureau, and 63 people have registered to participate, including 56 men and 7 women.

### Second Student Swimming Competition; Held at Hongchi from 9:00 AM This Morning; Divided into Three Groups: University, Middle School, and Elementary School, Male and Female

In order to promote aquatic sports and cultivate new blood in the swimming community, the Municipal Sports Stadium held the second Shanghai Municipal Student Swimming Championship at Hongkou Swimming Pool this morning. 115 people participated, and these students came from various schools at all levels, and some came from as far away as the capital and North China. As summer goes to autumn and summer vacation is about to end, this large gathering of young men and women on the water is far more valuable than the athletes' competition. This morning's competition is divided into university and middle school boys, university and middle school girls, and elementary school boys and girls, and starts at 9:00 AM sharp, rain or shine. At that time, people and fish will be swimming through the waves, and a lively scene will unfold, breaking the silence of the pool in recent days. The top three winners in each event will be awarded exquisite medals, and those with excellent results will be given special awards. Ms. Li Yuehua, the daughter of Director Li of the Municipal Education Bureau, will be invited to come to the pool to give awards to show her support.

It has been found that in the registration list for the elementary school group, a middle school student has impersonated a replacement. This behavior is not only immoral, but also hinders the progress of the children. I hope that the impersonator will withdraw voluntarily, otherwise he will be reported, his qualifications will be revoked, and the guidance office of his school will be notified.

### Engagement Made in Childhood; Both Men and Women Agree to Dissolve

Chuan Hua asks: When I was ten years old, my parents arranged an engagement with a certain gentleman. Now that both of us have reached adulthood, for the sake of our future happiness, we have decided to dissolve the engagement. After I expressed this opinion, the other party did not object, and also said that they have no objection to dissolving the engagement and let me handle it freely. Recently, they sent another letter asking me to obtain a "letter of opinion agreeing to dissolve the engagement" so that they can publish it in the newspaper. After I received the two letters, I did as requested. However, several months have passed, and I have not seen it published in the newspaper. I have also sent a letter to them requesting a similar "letter of opinion agreeing to dissolve the engagement," but I have not received a reply. Now I have several legal questions, please answer them for me. (1) Can the gentleman's letter stating that he has "no objection to dissolving the engagement and lets me handle it freely" be used as evidence that he agrees to dissolve the engagement? (2) If the above two items can be used as evidence, is it legal for me to publish a notice in the newspaper dissolving the engagement in the names of both parties? If I unilaterally publish a statement in the newspaper that the engagement is invalid and then send a clipping to the gentleman, is that legal? (3) Does a unilateral statement in the newspaper necessarily require proof from a lawyer? If it is necessary to have a lawyer's proof but I cannot afford the huge cost, are there any other remedies? (4) After publishing the notice in the newspaper, is sending the newspaper clipping to the gentleman considered to be the completion of the procedures? (5) Since the gentleman has stated that he has "no objection," does that mean that he has waived the right to claim "damages"?

[Mr. Tang Mingshi answers] (1) You stated in your question that the engagement was made at the age of ten. According to the Civil Code, a man must be at least seventeen years old and a woman must be at least fifteen years old to enter into an engagement (Article 973 of the Civil Code). Entering into an engagement at the age of ten is within the prohibited scope and should be considered invalid. An invalid engagement means that the engagement is not established. (2) To avoid worldly misunderstandings, you can unilaterally publish a notice in the newspaper declaring that the engagement is invalid according to the Civil Code, and there is no question of dissolving it. (3) It is not necessary to hire a lawyer to publish the notice in the newspaper; however, if the situation is complicated or the legal principles are unclear, it is advisable to consult a lawyer (i.e., a legal expert) to analyze and explain it. (4) There is compensation for damages only if there is negligence; if there is no negligence, there is no responsibility for compensation for damages. (5) An engagement that is originally invalid is clear once it is declared. Even if it is not declared, it is not binding.

This relief fund is specifically designed for those who are orphaned, widowed, disabled, elderly, weak, poor, or sick. The application procedure is to prepare an application form, describe your background and family situation, have it certified by the local Baozhang or Lizhang, and find a shop guarantor to register and mail it to the Social Services Department of this newspaper for review. Those who are found to be true after being investigated by our staff will be given subsidies as appropriate.

Recently, prices have risen sharply, and the amount of subsidies has had to be slightly increased. The original funds are about to be exhausted. We hope that enthusiastic readers from all walks of life will be compassionate and generously donate to give comfort to these fellow compatriots in distress and rekindle their courage to survive. This is what the colleagues in this column earnestly hope for.

(Opinion from Hu Zhijue, Fuzhou Road)

Your bureau receives telegrams from 11:00 AM to about 3:00 PM. Because the senders are crowded and the handling of the fee is troublesome, it takes more than two hours to wait, which is contrary to the principle of fast telegram service. I would like to offer two suggestions: (1) Calculate the number of words and various items in the heading, and clearly notify the method of filling in the form. The sender can calculate and fill in the form in the newspaper heading, and the business staff only need to check and issue a receipt to save procedures. (2) Issue telegram price coupons in the same way as postage stamps. The sender can paste them, and the electricity bureau can stamp and verify them at the collection office. This can avoid the trouble of collecting cash and reduce waiting time.

(Answer) Thank you for your valuable suggestions, which we deeply appreciate. We have long paid attention to the first point, and we have recently added the filling method of the heading and the calculation formula of the telegram fee in the new price list so that the sender can calculate the fee and fill it in by himself. However, it is bound to be unsatisfactory at the beginning, and our bureau will do its best to publicize the telegram sending procedures and fee calculation methods to make up for the above shortcomings. As for the second point, because the nature of telegrams and letters is different, the former calculates the fee by word, that is, the telegram fee increases or decreases due to the number of words or the type of telegram. It is not as simple as the latter, which calculates the fee by piece. It is currently difficult to implement the issuance of telegram price coupons. Our bureau is currently working with the Bank of Communications to jointly study the issuance of a telegraphic check to replace cash. It will be implemented as soon as the research is completed.

### Talking About Falseness

— Wu Yong

The most complicated and difficult thing to investigate is politics. According to today's chemical knowledge, we know that a certain amount of hydrogen plus a certain amount of oxygen will inevitably result in water; with today's astronomical knowledge, we can predict when there will be a solar eclipse and when there will be a lunar eclipse, even if they are far away in the sky, without any deviation. But only politics, which is most closely related to human beings, still has no precise principles to follow. Thinking about the rise and fall of dynasties, and whether a certain policy or action of a certain official in history was a merit or a crime, later generations have different opinions. Even those who have thought deeply and studied extensively for years are still unable to reach a definitive conclusion today. Speaking of today, and saying how a policy or reform will be effective, it can be decided in a few words, who can believe it? Reading the grand theories of famous officials in the past, we often find that what they discussed is inconsistent with the subsequent development, and when they were published, people admired them. Judging from this, what is the value of today's grand theories, we can think about more than half of it.

The reason why political theories are difficult to obtain accurately is that people cannot be selfless; if they cannot be selfless, their words will inevitably be false. Because people are members of the group, and they cannot speak about group affairs without adding their own selfish opinions and prejudices, purely from an objective perspective outside of themselves, as if observing the actions of the world from other planets. This is almost impossible. Su Shi's poem "I do not know the true face of Mount Lu, only because I am in this mountain," refers to this. It is better to observe the celestial phenomena far away in the sky clearly, and the rock layers deep in the ground can be measured and surveyed clearly. But when it comes to arranging one's own affairs, it is like a blind person catching a black cat in the dark, it is absolutely difficult to be sure.

For example, some of the roads in this city are like bloated thighs suddenly turning into skinny heron legs, some are arranged in a triangle, and the houses in them are like reefs at sea, and some are curved like bows or crossed like kudzu vines. The shapes are not only ugly, but also contribute to the various inconveniences in today's traffic. The reason for this is only because the landowners at the beginning insisted on every inch of land and would never easily make sacrifices. Therefore, if you elect a landowner to manage road affairs, you cannot expect him to be completely selfless and purely consider the matter. Broadly speaking, when people in the group talk about group governance, the degree to which they cannot completely forget their own private interests may vary, but in nature, it is no different from the landowner's management of road affairs.

Also, the most precise science is numbers. One plus one is always two, and no one will say it is three. But the "cost of living index" a while ago was nothing more than a mathematical problem, but it was often the subject of debate among people from all walks of life. On the day the index was released, some thought it was too high, and some thought it was too low, and there was a lot of discussion and no consensus. The reason is that it is related to private interests, and the discussion is different; on the boss's side, one plus one is best still one, and on the employee's side, one plus one is best three. As for those who compile the index, they are not gods high in the clouds, and it is not surprising that there may be biases or imbalances. Therefore, today's human beings have the intelligence to manufacture smooth-running machines, but there are no good policies in personnel matters to prevent friction between labor and capital in manufacturing machines.

It can be seen that politics is very difficult, but people think it is the easiest. Ignorant people are not worth mentioning, but even intellectuals often think of something and casually talk about politics. They praise those who are beneficial to themselves to the sky, and arbitrarily slander those who are harmful to themselves. Their recklessness is no different from that of peddlers and hawkers. Those who do not understand astronomy rarely dare to talk about astronomy, and those who do not understand geology rarely dare to talk about geology. But now, whenever politics is involved, everyone thinks they understand, and old and young can talk about it. Even scholars who study astronomy and geology often blame those who are not experts for talking about astronomy and geology, and are surprised that they are presumptuous and overestimate their abilities. But when it comes to politics, they all have their own set of high opinions. They not only think they can talk about politics, but also believe they can do politics. Their science is scientific in what they have learned, but not scientific in what they have not learned.

Recently, I read a set of science books. Among them, I found the natural science part quite enlightening, but the social science works felt like they were based on unfounded theories, and there was a big difference from reality. The author was a great Confucian scholar, not a mediocre village scholar. However, he was still false to such an extent, and I was deeply shocked. Therefore, I wrote down my feelings as above.

### The Editor Who Goes to Jail; Belgrade, the Capital of Yugoslavia

— Cang Yu

In Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, every newspaper has a "jail editor." This is an editor hired by the newspaper to take the blame for the newspaper. If the newspaper publishes any remarks that offend the authorities, that editor will go to jail for the newspaper. If the newspaper publishes a signed article and that article causes trouble, but the person who wrote the article denies that it is his work, then this "jail editor" will stand up and admit that he wrote the article, and he will go to jail without any difficulty. But after he gets out of prison, the newspaper will give him a considerable allowance.

### A Single Action, Multiple Gains

— Shuo Fu

Since getting married, I have learned some small experiences from my wife. At the beginning of our marriage, because we couldn't find a suitable servant immediately, and our current nanny, Yao, was still in the countryside and hadn't come to Shanghai, my wife had to manage the household affairs and also handle some household chores. Not only could she arrange everything in an orderly manner, but she was also able to make full use of her time. For example, when she was boiling water on the stove, she would take the time to tidy up the room or go to the market to buy vegetables. By the time she returned from buying vegetables, the water would be hot, and the room would be tidied up. After resting for a while, she could prepare lunch. When simmering meat or something else over a low flame, she could also find some spare time to sew on buttons or do some other small tasks. As a result, she accomplished many things in a day, yet she was not busier than others, nor was she any more tired.

As the saying goes, "kill two birds with one stone." From my wife's work, I realized that the usefulness of "one action, multiple gains" is infinite. For example, recently the price of telephone calls has increased. Before making a call, I must first consider and decide on two or three things to discuss with the person I am calling. This could include: (1) inquiring about the address of another friend, (2) sending greetings to the other person, (3) agreeing to or entrusting the other person to handle something... Naturally, the more things you can think of, the more economical it is to use the telephone.

Another example is writing articles. When I see the editor of a certain magazine, I can: (1) give him the manuscript I agreed to write, (2) discuss the conditions for publishing a single volume, (3) pass on an article written by a friend... and so on.

Furthermore, when I have time to read, especially when reading books about biographical literature, I can: (1) learn about principles of conduct and how to deal with the world, (2) find material for writing articles, (3) refer to writing techniques...

Someone said it well: the invention of the train shortened the distance between two places; the invention of the ship shortened the distance between two continents; the invention of the airplane shortened the distance of the entire world. The above focuses on space. I think anyone who can be familiar with the wonders of "one action, multiple gains" can also shorten the distance in time and make their personal life more fulfilling and meaningful.

### Also Recording the Recluse of Great Crane Mountain

— Chen Yi Xian

In this column, there is an article written by Qian Dacheng entitled "Recording the Recluse of Great Crane". I will add this article based on what I know.

The Recluse of Great Crane Mountain's surname is Zheng, his name is Wenzhuo, his courtesy name is Shujian. He was knowledgeable in many fields, especially skilled in writing ci poetry. The world compared him to the ci poets of the Song Dynasty, such as Mei Cheng, Baishi, and Mengchuang. At the age of twenty (in the first year of the Guangxu era before the Republic), he passed the Enke imperial examination in Shuntian. After that, he took the palace examination eight times, all without success. In the 29th year of Guangxu, when he took the re-administered Xin Chou palace examination, the Recluse was already forty-eight years old. He gave up on pursuing officialdom and had a private seal engraved with the words "Retired Scholar of Jiangnan" to show that he had no intention of becoming a Jinshi scholar. In his later years, he purchased five mu of land in Xiaoyi Fang, Suzhou, and built a new residence, calling it Tongde Lane. To its east was a rolling hill, the old site of the Wu Xiaocheng city. He built a pavilion on the high point of the city, calling it Wu Dong Pavilion, surrounded by bamboo fences, with a very good view. Below it, a stream flows around, which is the Zicheng moat, also known as Jin Fan Jing.

The Recluse's ci poetry was as famous as that of Zhu Qiangcun. In his later years, Qiangcun also chose to live in Wucheng Xiaoshi Bridge, listening to the maple trees. The two ci poets often visited each other. Before the Republic, the governors of Jiangsu admired the Recluse's talent and reputation and invited him to join their staff, providing him with generous salaries and seeking his advice. Therefore, the Recluse lived in Wu for more than thirty years and became a master of ci poetry. After the establishment of the Republic, Confucian scholars were no longer valued by the world, and their livelihoods were shortened as a result. The Recluse then used his other skills to sell paintings and practice medicine, barely making a living for his family, and he often traveled between Shanghai and Suzhou. The price list of the Recluse of Great Crane Mountain was drafted by Zhu Qiangcun and several others. It is recorded below, so that one can learn about the Recluse's personality and his situation in his later years.

"The recluse Zheng Shuwen from Gaomi, whose later name was the Recluse of Great Crane Mountain, was unconstrained and unrestrained, and his friends from all over the world were famous scholars of their time. He lived in Wu for more than thirty years, calling himself a mountain man, and gave up on pursuing officialdom, declining repeated invitations. He lived in seclusion in the east of Wu Xiaocheng, cultivated a garden of five mu, and wrote books until his death. He researched and compiled the secrets of all aspects of learning, including textual research, textual criticism, ci poetry, phonology, medical classics, and meteorological treatises. He often used calligraphy and painting for entertainment in his remaining days. His brushwork was elegant and unrestrained, no less than that of Da Di and Xue Ge. Those who admired him often paid high prices for his work, and the paper in Jiangnan became expensive because of it. Now, to avoid the world by the sea, his comrades have urged him to imitate the old deeds of Banqiao Daoren of your family and draw up a price list to meet the needs of the world. This is also a way for virtuous people to make a living."

The Recluse passed away at the age of sixty-three (in 1918). The year before, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, the president of Peking University, asked Luo Dunxi to invite the Recluse to be the director of the Department of Epigraphy and Paleography and also serve as a school doctor. The Recluse wrote a reply to Luo Dunxi, which is also recorded below. Reading it, one can see that the Recluse was extremely stubborn even in his old age and poverty.

"Last year, I read your letter with gratitude. You expressed your condolences for my deceased wife in detail, and I am very grateful for your kindness and benevolence. I am also deeply grateful to receive the generous contribution of three hundred gold coins from my old friend Ren Gong, which helped me in my urgent need to relieve the poor and help the unfortunate. I am overwhelmed with gratitude and will remember it deeply. Because I am weak and ill, I have delayed in expressing my thanks. I hope you will forgive me and convey my sincere feelings. I am very fortunate. My late wife's funeral is scheduled for a certain date, so I dare to inform you and respectfully request you to send it to Shanghai. I have been collecting books for many years and have suffered many hardships at home. Lately, knowing both life and death has only increased my pain as a commoner. Yesterday, I received a letter from Mr. Cai Yuanpei, inviting me to be the director of the Department of Epigraphy and Paleography and also serve as a school doctor, with a monthly salary of about four hundred foreign dollars. The treatment is indeed generous and generous. However, considering that I am a survivor of the fallen country, have been in the south for forty years, and am tired of traveling north, I am afraid that I will have difficulty adapting. Moreover, I have heard that the cost of hiring servants, renting houses, and buying rice in the capital is ten times higher than in the south, making it very difficult to live there. Seeing the changes in the world, how can I compare myself to the ancients? I have long been content with being decadent and free, so how dare I be a lecturer in the capital of the state? Practicing medicine and selling paintings to support myself in old age is my natural disposition. I am honored to be attached to the end of the contract and offer my humble contribution. I have not fully expressed my wishes, but only to tell you that I am in a desolate place."

When the Recluse was thirty-eight years old (in the nineteenth year of Guangxu), he took in Zhang Xiaohong, a singer from Wu Qu, and wrote a "Plucked Red Plum" ci poem for her. It is said that during the Song Dynasty, Wu Yingzhi lived in Xiaoshi Bridge in Wucheng and had a maid named Hongmei, so he named his pavilion after her. He once wrote two "Plucked Red Plum" ci poems, which spread among the people. The Recluse imitated them and named his collection of ci poems "Cold Red." Qian Dacheng said in his article "Recording Zheng Dahe": "In his later years, Dahe was down and out and often sat in a teahouse with an old concubine." Perhaps this was Zhang Xiaohong?

### Autumn Residence Feelings

— Ye Gongchuo

Leaning on the railing, the clouds are illusory,
A bright lamp, the rain's atmosphere settles.
The sky is long, passing a hundred scenes,
The earth turns, obtaining a distant heart.
The stream's waterfall returns a cool breeze,
The mountain pines twist in the evening shade.
Choosing to live here, I am completely enamored,
Not envying the swallows nesting in the forest.

Idly talking about matters beyond the mortal realm,
Briefly planning for a leopard's seclusion.
Ashamed of a fragment of stone to mend the sky,
Departing the world in a single boat.
Who is confused by human affairs?
The mountain recesses have responses to inquiries.
Drunkenly sleeping, freely letting go,
The bell rings, marking the fifth watch of the night.

### 

Before the Qixi Festival, an old centenarian in Beiping ascended to heaven (94-year-old Lu Jingben Qi). Before the Zhongyuan Festival, an old centenarian in Shanghai returned to his place (92-year-old Chen Xunlong Xiaoshi). In terms of age, old Lu was two years older than old Chen. In terms of official rank, old Chen was two ranks higher than old Lu. (Lu was the Director of Education, Chen was a Grand Secretary and Governor-General.)

Old Chen had a high official rank, long lifespan, and great fortune. After serving as Governor-General, he spent thirty-seven years in leisure and freedom in Chun Shen, which is what northerners call a "favored person." And the most rare thing is that he completed the three stages of: (1) revisiting the pool of learning, (2) re-attending the deer banquet, and (3) re-attending the Qionglin banquet. There are really not many old scholars who have achieved this, because the "re-" in "revisiting" and "re-attending" represents a long distance of sixty years. When encountering a year with the same stem and branch, it is called "one re-." The stem and branch must cycle every sixty years, so it is called Zhou Jia.

Old Chen obtained the title of "Xiucai" in the Ren Shen year of the eleventh year of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty, which is elegantly called "entering the official school," or "visiting the school," at the age of sixteen (the founding year of Shenbao). In the 21st year of the Republic of China, it was Ren Shen again, and there was a celebration of "revisiting the pool of learning." His former master Puyi specially issued a "royal decree" with the inscription "The Spring of the Pool is Long." Friends wrote many congratulatory poems, which were published together in the "Collection of the Spring of the Pool is Long." His own commemorative poem said: "I still beg the heavens for more years, the cassia register in the autumn breeze, the apricot garden in spring." The meaning is that he wanted to increase his lifespan and extend his years in order to wait for the second "cassia register in the autumn breeze" (that is, the provincial examination) and the second "apricot garden in spring breeze" (that is, the metropolitan examination). He was already seventy-six years old when he wrote this poem. Sure enough, the "reunion of the provincial examination" came the following year, which is also "re-attending the deer banquet."

Old Chen obtained the title of Juren in the Yi Hai year at the age of nineteen (Enke of the first year of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty). According to the rules, if encountering the regular year of the previous examination, it is considered "reunion of the provincial examination." The previous examination of Yi Hai was Gui You, so in the 32nd year of the Republic of China, Gui You (that is, sixty years after Gui You in the twelfth year of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty), Puyi issued another "imperial decree" and awarded him the title of "Junior Guardian of the Heir Apparent." He also had a poem: "The thorny courtyard has come again as a former guest, the grand banquet is reopened in the fair hall." This refers to the old classics. In the past, there was a grand "deer banquet" after the results were announced, where the newly appointed Juren and the chief examiner performed rituals. The old Juren of sixty years ago also wore flowers and red ribbons to "re-attend" the banquet, which was extremely lively. However, after the Qing Dynasty abolished the imperial examination, the "re-attending" of the old scholars had no possibility of real scenery, only the empty words of honor and praise, just to express their feelings.

Old Chen's Xiucai and Juren titles were obtained very early, and he was only nineteen years old when he obtained the Juren title, so the year of "re-attending" was not yet eighty. However, he passed the metropolitan examination in Bing Xu (the twelfth year of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty), when Chen was already thirty years old. Then, "reunion of the metropolitan examination" would have to wait until the age of ninety (thirty plus sixty). It is rare for a person to live to be eighty, and it is even more difficult to live to be ninety. For example, Yu Quyuan (Yue) lived to be eighty-six years old, which is not short, but he only "reunited with the provincial examination." Quyuan wrote a poem when he was eighty-two years old to re-attend the deer banquet: "There is still a cup of wine from the Qionglin, can the spring breeze linger again?" He hoped to live a few more years and catch up with the grand celebration of "re-attending the Qionglin banquet." However, he passed the Jinshi examination at the age of thirty (Geng Rong year of Daoguang of the Qing Dynasty), and he would have to wait until the age of ninety to encounter "the next Geng Xu." Old Yu only lived to be eighty-six years old, four years short. The spring breeze did not wait, and this wish was in vain.

Old Chen was also proud of himself at the age of thirty (Bing Xu of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty). The year before last (the 35th year of the Republic of China) was again the old Bing Xu year, and he completed another major stage. Unfortunately, his former master Puyi was in a precarious situation, similar to the last days of the Song Emperor in "Wuguo City," and there was no possibility of issuing honors again. Then, the Chen residence in Shanghai the year before last seemed to have no interest in celebrating, which was a bit of a flaw.
