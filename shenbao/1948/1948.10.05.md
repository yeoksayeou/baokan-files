The attacking bandits belong to the 8th Column. As of noon on the 4th, the fighting has slightly shifted westward.

### Chen Xueping Issues Statement. The Government Cares About Displaced Youths from the Northeast. Unreasonable Demands Will Not Be Accepted.

[Our newspaper Beiping, 4th dispatch] Students from private colleges and universities in the Northeast went to the presidential residence in Hou Yuan En Temple on the 4th to petition, requesting that they be allowed to join the national colleges and universities in the Northeast without taking an exam. They wanted to organize a team to carry out the petition yesterday, but they were temporarily stopped by the police and constabulary. On the morning of the 4th, they disintegrated into smaller groups and gathered hundreds of people near Hou Yuan En Temple. The police and constabulary imposed a curfew nearby. The students then sent five representatives to be met by Chen Xueping on behalf of the President, who promised to convey their demands to the President.

[Central News Agency Beiping, 4th dispatch] Minister of Youth Chen Xueping issued a statement regarding the petition of students from the Northeast in Beiping to see the President, saying: "The Ministry of Education has restored the four national colleges and universities in the Northeast and established temporary high schools to enable most students to study. Only 1,800 students from private colleges and universities are urgently trying to find a way to settle in. On the morning of the 4th, five representatives of these students visited the President to petition and made two requests: (1) Establish a temporary college; (2) Or be unconditionally accepted by national colleges and universities. I was assigned to meet with them on behalf of the President and refused their demands. The grading test for students from the Northeast was to give them the opportunity to study in national colleges and universities, but unfortunately, a small number of students disrupted the test site. It is regrettable. In the future, in addition to those who follow the rules to participate in the grading test and can still join the colleges and universities, there will be no alternative even if they visit the President to petition again. At that time, I made four suggestions to the student representatives: (1) Students from provincial technical colleges are easier to solve, and the admission problem can be handled immediately. (2) The four national colleges and universities will give them another opportunity to take the grading test, and they will be admitted leniently. After admission, they will be given strict training. (3) Tianjin cram school will start classes immediately, and an office will be set up in Beiping. In addition to the basic courses, elective specialized courses will be added according to the department. (4) The problem of food and housing can be solved after grading and admission. Those who are not admitted will be assigned to the cram school. Winter clothes will be discussed with Commander Fu and fundraising will be conducted from all parties. Finally, Minister Chen emphasized: "The government cares about the displaced youths at all times and tries its best to rescue them and promote their education. However, unreasonable demands will never be accepted. It is beyond the scope for a small number of students to smash theaters and obstruct traffic. Most students should unite to punish them."

### Legislative Yuan's Finance and 金融 Monetary Affairs and Legal System Committees. Enthusiastically Discuss the Increase in Tax Rates. Deputy Finance Minister Xu Said that Balancing Income and Expenditure is a Real and Urgent Pain.

[Our newspaper Nanjing, 4th dispatch] The various committees of the Legislative Yuan met separately on the 4th to handle the cases submitted to the Yuan for review. The Internal Affairs and Local Autonomy Committee completed the initial review of the Film Inspection Law Amendment Draft in the afternoon, and all penalties were reduced.

[Our newspaper Nanjing, 4th dispatch] The Finance 金融Monetary Affairs and Legal System Committees of the Legislative Yuan held a joint meeting at 9:00 am on the 4th, chaired by Xie Xingqu, to discuss the case submitted by Cheng Tianfang and others, requesting the Executive Yuan to promptly submit the changed tax rates to the Legislative Yuan for review in order to complete the Legislative Yuan's procedures. First, Xu Baiyuan, the acting Finance Minister who was invited to attend the meeting, explained the situation of the tax rate increase. Xu pointed out three points: (1) The increase in salt tax was based on the emergency decree promulgated by President "August 19"; (2) The customs duty was added in accordance with the new tariff rate approved by the Legislative Yuan; (3) The commodity tax was collected in accordance with the tax rate approved by the Legislative Yuan. Then, the members questioned the points. The main points were that the increase in salt tax was too heavy, ignoring the people's livelihood and the resolution of the Legislative Yuan in the previous session, and raised the issue of the scope of the President's use of emergency powers under the temporary clauses and the issue of the Legislative Yuan's procedures for increasing tax rates. After Minister Xu answered once, the members stood up and questioned each other, mostly criticizing the Executive Yuan for ignoring the resolutions of the Legislative Yuan. Then, Minister Xu answered again, and the main points were as follows: (1) The tax rate increase was based on the emergency decree. Whether it should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures is subject to interpretation. If it is considered that it should be submitted for review, the administrative authorities should submit it for review. (2) At that time, the planning was indeed very cautious, but in order to balance income and expenditure, there was a real and urgent pain. (3) Although the salt tax has increased, the burden on the people is not too heavy. (4) The increase in salt tax did not dare to delay in time in order to prevent abuses. At that time, it was really unavoidable. After Minister Xu's second reply, he retired. The members raised opinions on how to review the case, and the speakers were very enthusiastic and thoroughly discussed it. After repeated and detailed discussions, it was unanimously believed that this case should wait for the Executive Yuan's written reply to the Legislative Yuan's inquiries about the emergency decree in the first two secret meetings before merging and discussing it, and the members convened by the Finance 金融Monetary Affairs Committee should study it first before adjourning the meeting at noon.

(2) It is recommended that the Executive Yuan formulate standard prices for state-owned, publicly-owned, or privately-owned enterprises within three months, and make a comprehensive planned economic control before making reasonable adjustments.

### Editorial: Panic Buying, Floating Capital, and Production

Recently, a phenomenon of panic buying has emerged in the market. It was first observed in Chengdu, and subsequently in Chongqing, Kunming and other places. These occurrences have specific reasons, namely, the so-called nickel coin crisis, which we will not discuss for now.

However, the panic buying phenomenon in this city has no specific cause. It is merely due to (1) the strict enforcement of price controls, which is more thorough than in other places. The general perception is that prices are cheap, so people seize the opportunity to buy more, lest they miss out. (2) Because the supply of a few special commodities, such as meat, eggs, and vegetables, as well as Western medicines like penicillin, has occasionally been short, people associate this with other goods, thinking that the same situation may occur. (3) Since the currency reform, prices in this city have been generally very stable. The authorities have repeatedly announced that all price limits from "August 19th," except for certain commodities related to foreign exchange and increased taxes, will be reasonably adjusted, and the rest will remain unchanged. However, the expectation of rising prices in some people's minds has not been completely eliminated. (4) Scalpers have fueled the fire, creating a trend of panic buying. (5) There is an abundance of floating capital with nowhere to go, and although production is supposedly being safeguarded by the authorities, it is still excessively restricted, unable to attract floating capital. This leads to the spontaneous attack on goods by scattered surplus purchasing power in the hands of the people. Among the various factors mentioned above, except for the abundance of floating capital, which has been unanimously called for by all parties and indeed needs to be improved as soon as possible, the other points (1, 2, and 3) are actually unfounded and must be said to be caused by psychological misperceptions.

The reason is quite clear. Regarding the breaching of price controls, although some merchants, accustomed to old habits, may still expect it to happen, the authorities' attitude is firm and has not relaxed at all. We really have no indication to believe that the current cheap goods will soon disappear and be unattainable. Moreover, the implementation of economic controls is not only increasing but also becoming more comprehensive. For example, the establishment of economic supervisors in Central China and the expansion of the Shanghai area to include three provinces and two municipalities. These measures clearly aim to strengthen controls so that prices in various regions can match Shanghai, rather than relaxing controls in Shanghai to allow it to match other regions. Therefore, the future prices, except for commodities related to foreign exchange and increased taxes, are indeed unlikely to generally rise.

As for supply, with the outflow of goods still under strict control, this city's finished products actually only have a surplus and will not feel a shortage. The market is also not expected to fluctuate. Because Shanghai is the number one commercial port for imports in China and the main center of the national industry, these imported goods and manufactured products usually reach every corner of the country. Except for a very few commodities with special reasons, the quantity of storage can support several months at least. Moreover, before the export of goods returns to normal and still requires permission, how could there be a problem with the supply of these stored goods to the five million people in this city? Furthermore, the authorities have recently been actively seeking ways to open up foreign exchange, and to facilitate the supply of raw materials to factories, expanding allocations and preparing to barter with other regions. With such a two-pronged approach to production and sales, Shanghai will remain the economic center of the country, and the various goods sold locally will only account for a small part of it, so there is no need to worry about shortages.

What is truly concerning is how to absorb the floating capital. Currently, the government has implemented countermeasures such as the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks, the promotion of short-term Gold Yuan treasury bonds, the liquidation of enemy and puppet assets and surplus materials, and the deadline for commercial banks to increase their capital. These measures are all underway. However, according to the report of the Issuance Reserve Supervision Committee, as of September 30, the total amount of Gold Yuan issued nationwide has reached more than 950 million yuan, almost half of the legal issuance amount. And that doesn't include the legal tender and Northeast circulation notes that are circulating outside and have not been recovered. If a way to quickly withdraw this huge amount of currency is not found, the potential for threatening prices and tempting speculation and hoarding cannot be ignored! In this situation, if the authorities remain indifferent, thinking that panic buying is just a result of citizens' psychology, and do not consider ways to encourage floating capital to be used for production, the consequences are worrying! So how can a large amount of floating capital be quickly recovered? How can floating capital be turned to increase production? We believe that:

First, the simplest method is to restore interbank fixed deposits and return them to the central bank's vault. This was the old method before the currency reform and is also the most convenient procedure. As long as the interest rate is reasonably set, so that commercial banks do not suffer obvious losses, the power to absorb floating capital will probably be more effective than any other method. The problem is that if the central bank cannot use this deposit like other banks, it will inevitably lose interest. However, for the sake of the overall economic situation, the country's small loss seems to be not entirely meaningless. Moreover, the central bank is the bank of banks and has the responsibility to regulate finance and control currency. At this time when funds are too loose and cannot be immediately absorbed, it seems inappropriate to stand idly by and do nothing!

Secondly, the fundamental problem is still to start with encouraging production. After the central bank absorbs floating capital, it should immediately conduct strict assessments. As long as it is truly a new production enterprise, or an expansion of production equipment, or the purchase of production raw materials, loans can be granted or mobile funds can be lent in the form of orders, so that most of the floating capital in society can be invested in production enterprises through the financial industry, especially the central bank. On the one hand, funds have legitimate uses, and on the other hand, materials can be increased, which can eliminate the current strange phenomenon of "not engaging in production but specializing in grabbing materials."

Finally, we would like to straightforwardly remind the government and the people of the two most important points: (1) There is only limiting consumption, and there is absolutely no limiting production. If the authorities' intention is to limit consumption, and other measures may cause those engaged in production to hesitate, or even cause legitimate industrialists and businessmen to have the illusion that they may be blamed at any time, and they all tend to tighten and become passive, then even if there are a lot of stored materials, there will inevitably be a day when the mountains are eaten away. Therefore, the government should immediately use various facts to express its determination to support production enterprises, so that legitimate industrialists and businessmen have no doubts. (2) The Gold Yuan policy must succeed and not fail. The good and law-abiding people have handed over their gold, silver, and foreign currencies, declared their foreign exchange assets, and exchanged them for Gold Yuan. The government has the responsibility to protect their property and maintain the value of the Gold Yuan. On the other hand, it also has the obligation to make the powerful and wealthy also abide by the law, hand over their assets, and support the national policy, so that it can gain the complete trust of the general public. At the same time, the people should also trust the government, change their old mentality of valuing goods and undervaluing currency, value the Gold Yuan notes in their hands, and cherish their use. It should be known that this Gold Yuan policy has truly brought the people and the government to the point of sharing the same fate economically. If the people only know how to grab materials and do not invest in production to increase materials, then the day when the materials are all grabbed is the day when the national economy completely collapses!

### ### "Scalpers" Flock to Suzhou and Hangzhou, Many Shops Close to Avoid Them, Panic Buying in Wuxi is Also Chaotic

[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 4th] Today, a large group of scalpers came from Shanghai to Suzhou and went to various shops to panic buy goods, first focusing on wool yarn, Western medicines, and other important daily necessities, and then competing to buy wool, cloth, hardware, and other items. These people are all young men and women, with a large organization and strong financial resources. The stores in Suzhou were already running low on stock, barely able to cope with the market every day. Seeing the situation was not good, most of them closed their doors to avoid them. Currently, the authorities believe that these people are disrupting the market and harming the people's livelihood, and have ordered them to be arrested and dealt with according to law.

[Our Hangzhou Correspondent, 4th] Shanghai scalpers came to Hangzhou and bought a large number of foreign cosmetics, making the shortage of goods in the market even worse. Today, prices have suddenly become serious, and cigarette and candy stores have closed down. Cloth stores closed at 3 pm, gold stores only opened briefly in the morning, and the rice market is short of goods, with citizens scrambling to buy them. Except for a few items such as soap, there is a black market for everything, and artificial silk has exceeded the price limit by a large margin.

[Our Wuxi Correspondent, 4th] Because the tobacco, alcohol, and foil tax have been ordered to increase, but Wuxi has not yet implemented it, serious disputes have arisen due to panic buying. The Command Post, the Pacification and Reconstruction Team, and the County Government held a meeting this afternoon at 4 pm and decided to increase the tax accordingly. The increase will be confirmed tomorrow morning and implemented immediately to prevent scalpers from panic buying.

In addition, people in Wuxi are panic buying various daily necessities, and the situation is chaotic. Silk and cloth stores are finding it difficult to cope and are closing early, euphemistically calling it "organizing inventory and registering." Although the authorities have arrested some scalpers, their number has actually increased. The yarn industry recently petitioned the county government, requesting that the crackdown be strengthened. Oil factories are also facing a standstill in production due to high raw material prices and shortages, and have also petitioned the county government for relief. Currently, the county government has decided to send a telegram to the Economic Supervision Office to request the transportation of oil for relief. Due to the shortage of flour, the flour industry has decided to register exports and require flour factories to supply the raw noodles industry.

### Market Disorder in Zhenjiang

Pacification and Reconstruction Team Launches Inspection

[Our Zhenjiang Correspondent, 4th] Recently, the market in Zhenjiang has been chaotic.

Chairman Ding of the Jiangsu Provincial Government personally went on a private tour today. He will severely punish illegal merchants who hoard and manipulate prices. Also, a part of the Pacification and Reconstruction Team has arrived in Zhenjiang and is actively launching inspection work.

### Using Tampered Scales to Cover Up Black Markets, Adulteration to Evade Inspection, Cotton Market in Nantong is Unusually Quiet

[Our Nantong Correspondent, 4th] As cotton is being put on the market, many purchasing companies are using tampered scales to cover up black markets. Because the cotton-producing area is unstable and adulterated cotton is evading inspection, it is being transported to Haimen for export, resulting in a quiet cotton market here. Nantong Dasheng No. 1 Factory and its subsidiary factory need 1,000 piculs of cotton every day, but they can only purchase more than a dozen today. The gap is huge, and the cotton inventory is only enough for 20 days, which is worrying.

### Capital Increase Period for Banks and Money Shops in Remote Provinces to Be Extended

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] The deadline for banks and money shops in remote provinces to increase their capital may be slightly extended compared to the deadline for capital increases for banks and money shops in major cities. The extension period is currently being studied by relevant parties. The reason for the extension is that transportation is difficult in remote provinces. By the time the Ministry of Finance's measures to adjust the capital of banks and money shops reach these areas, most of the capital increase period has already passed. To take actual difficulties into account, the capital increase period for banks and money shops in remote provinces may be extended to two months after the Ministry of Finance's measures reach them. However, this measure still needs to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval after it is formulated. In addition, the method of using cash deposited in the Central Bank within three months after the capital increase of banks and money shops will also be submitted for discussion at this week's Executive Yuan meeting and announced after approval.

### Many Banks and Money Shops Violate Regulations, Ministry of Finance Imposes Penalties

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] In addition to suspending the operations of various illegal banks and money shops in the past, the Ministry of Finance has also imposed penalties on the Hankou Zhongdao Money Shop and the Tianjin Pinghe Silver Bank by revoking their licenses after inspection. The reason for revoking the license of Zhongdao Money Shop is that it was privately issuing gold notes, setting up secret accounts, and trading in goods. The reason for revoking the license of Pinghe Silver Bank is that it was forging documents. In addition, the Shanghai Dadao Money Shop, the Hankou Jinan Money Shop, the Shanghai Tongyu Yongji Money Shop, and the Chongqing Tonghui Bank were also found to have set up secret accounts, issued unauthorized promissory notes, and altered account records. They have all been sent to the court for punishment.

### Yongli Factory Platinum Gauze Screen to Be Shipped Back from Japan on Schedule

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] A platinum gauze screen worth US$40,000 is scheduled to be airlifted to China on the 18th to replace the old platinum gauze screen. The old item was stolen when the Yongli Nitric Acid Plant, recently returned to China, was still under the custody of the Japanese government. The platinum gauze screen is an important contact agent, and its return will allow the nitric acid plant to resume work. The Yongli Nitric Acid Plant in Nanjing is the largest of its kind in China. It is reported that its reconstruction work will soon be completed. The factory was looted by the Japanese in 1942 and was only returned to the Chinese government by Japan at the beginning of this year.

### Prosecutor Requests Retrial of Case Involving Students Zhu Chengxue and Others Conspiring with Communists in Nanjing, Awaiting Justice to Achieve the Effect of Pacification and National Reconstruction

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 4th] After students Zhu Chengxue, Hua Binqing, and Li Fei, who were Communist spies at National Central University, and Tao Yuangui and Tang Shigui, members of the Nanjing City Work Department Transportation Group of the Communist Party, were sentenced to six, five, and ten years in prison, respectively, by the Special Criminal Court of the Capital, they all felt that the sentence was too heavy and requested a retrial by the Central Special Criminal Court. However, the original prosecutor, Gu Rulun, believed that the original judgment was flawed in its determination of facts and application of the law and also requested a retrial. His petition for retrial stated that the defendants Zhu Chengxue, Hua Binqing, and Li Fei were ideologically leftist when they studied at National Central University. They frequently contacted the leaders of the Democratic League, accepted instructions from Communist spies, engaged in subversive activities, directed leftist wall posters at National Central University, made reactionary propaganda from time to time, and incited student movements, leading strikes. These facts were verified by the Capital Garrison Headquarters, the Gendarmerie Headquarters, and the Central Bureau of Statistics, respectively. The investigation reports were attached to the case file as evidence. However, the original judgment stated that the trial did not have sufficient positive evidence to support the allegations and should be dismissed. However, the Capital Garrison Headquarters and the Gendarmerie Headquarters have the duty to assist judicial organs in investigating crimes. This is clearly stipulated in the current Criminal Procedure Law and the Regulations on the Dispatch of Judicial Police. Therefore, their investigation reports should be based on facts discovered during the investigation. If no definitive evidence is found to prove that the investigation is not true, it cannot be considered untrue based on one's own subjective opinion. The original judgment expressed a lack of confidence in the investigations of the above three agencies but failed to explain the reasons for not adopting them. This is the first reason why the prosecutor believes that the original judgment's determination of facts cannot be considered appropriate. Furthermore, the defendants Tao Yuangui and Tang Shigui served as members of the Nanjing City Work Department Transportation Group of the Communist Party, frequently carrying out transportation work for Communist spies. The defendants Zhu Chengxue, Hua Binqing, and Li Fei were instructed by Communist spies to repeatedly incite student movements, propagate communism, and lead riots. The above-mentioned defendants had willingly joined the Communist Party organization, accepted their orders, and implemented various subversive activities in the rear area of the capital in order to achieve the Communist Party's plan to open a second war, echoing the Communist Party's riots in the front and working hard to consolidate their subversive foundation, so as to achieve the goal of overthrowing the government. The defendants should be held responsible for the crime of participating in the rebellion. What doubt is there? The prosecutor believes that the original judgment failed to address this in the charges listed in the indictment, which is the second reason why the prosecutor believes that the original judgment's application of the law is inappropriate. Based on the above two reasons, in accordance with Article 2 of the Special Criminal Court Trial Regulations and Article 10 of the Special Criminal Case Litigation Regulations, the prosecutor requests a retrial, hoping to revoke the original judgment and render a suitable judgment, so as to avoid impunity and achieve the effect of suppressing chaos and building the nation.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Zhang Zhong, a suspected Communist spy, has been investigated by the Special Investigation Office and prosecuted.

The judge instructed him to negotiate with the detention center, and he left the court.

### Minister He's Earnest Speech at Reception for Taiwan慰問團　Suppression of Banditry is the unanimous demand of the whole nation　Confident that no rebellion cannot be quelled

[Central News Agency Nanjing Fourth Dispatch] Minister He of the Ministry of National Defense, in his speech at the reception for the Taiwan慰問團 on the afternoon of the 4th, said:

You have come to Nanjing from Taiwan from afar, and will soon travel to various places to慰勞 the soldiers fighting against banditry. You will convey the concern and enthusiasm of the people of Taiwan for the soldiers to all officers and men, which will greatly boost morale and promote morale, so that all officers and men know that behind them, there are countless compatriots supporting them, hoping that they will complete the task of suppressing the rebellion as soon as possible and achieve the goal of national construction. Especially because the compatriots in Taiwan are far overseas and are not threatened by the banditry themselves, they are equally concerned about the officers and men at the front and give them warm慰勞, so this kind of enthusiasm and concern is especially precious and especially grateful.

Gentlemen, of course, have long understood that the current full-scale rebellion of the Communist bandits is the last obstacle to our national construction. We must overcome all difficulties and quell the banditry before the country can gradually enter a prosperous and happy state, and the people of the whole country can enjoy a peaceful and happy life. The country is a whole, indivisible, and compatriots across the country, regardless of region or province, are like a big family within the scope of the country. All blessings, misfortunes, advantages, disadvantages, and honor are related and common. The foolish and corrupt Qing government in the past did not understand this principle and abandoned the compatriots in Taiwan, allowing them to be slaughtered by Japanese imperialism. They did not know that Taiwan is an integral part of the entire China and is inseparable from the fate of the entire China. Therefore, from the Sino-Japanese War to the victory of the War of Resistance, the compatriots in Taiwan were of course ravaged by Japanese imperialism, and the entire China was also bullied by Japanese imperialism. After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, Japan surrendered, the foreign troubles of the entire country were eliminated, and the compatriots in Taiwan also realized the desire for freedom and liberation and returned to the embrace of the motherland. At present, the full-scale rebellion of the Communist bandits has made it impossible for the country to engage in construction, and the compatriots in many provinces and regions cannot live and work in peace and have been displaced. Although the compatriots in Taiwan have not suffered this kind of pain, from the fact that you gentlemen represent all the compatriots and come here from afar, we can prove that the compatriots in Taiwan have unlimited enthusiasm for quelling the banditry and do not forget the difficulties faced by the entire country because of the stability of this province. From this fact, it can be proved that the suppression of banditry is the unanimous demand of the people of the whole country. We firmly believe that with the concerted efforts of the whole country, there is no rebellion that cannot be quelled.

After the victory of the War of Resistance, Ying Qin personally went to various important cities and towns in Taiwan to handle the affairs of accepting the surrender of the Japanese army. He personally saw the education camp of the Taiwanese compatriots, the development of industry, the hard work and thrift of life, the good and stable social order, the loyalty and love to the country, and the active promotion of construction undertakings. He felt infinite gratification and believed that Taiwan is a model for our national construction and one of the bases for national rejuvenation. Today, I have such an opportunity to gather with you gentlemen again, representing officials from all over the country to accept the慰勞 of all the Taiwanese compatriots to the soldiers who suppressed the rebellion, and naturally feel especially excited. In order to enable the construction of Taiwan to have a demonstrative effect throughout the country, and the efforts of the compatriots in Taiwan to bear more satisfactory fruits on the road to national construction, I dare to guarantee that all the officers and soldiers will definitely work harder to repay the慰勞 of the compatriots in Taiwan and you gentlemen, and to fulfill the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country that our soldiers have shouldered.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourth Dispatch] The six members of the Taiwan Provincial慰問團, Huang Liandeng, Huang Zhenqiu, Chen Tianshun, Li Junyao, Xu Shixian, and Qiu Zhangmei, arrived in Beijing by train from Shanghai at 7:00 AM on the 4th to visit the central military authorities. They are scheduled to go to the front line to慰勞 the soldiers within a few days. The慰勞 goods they brought have been transported to Beiping, Shenyang, Xi'an, Taiyuan (a total of four tons), Xuzhou, and Yingkou (a total of two tons). On the morning of the 4th, the group visited He Yingqin and Gu Zhutong. In the afternoon, they visited the four headquarters of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Logistics separately. At 6:30 PM, He Yingqin and Gu Zhutong invited them to a banquet. The group is scheduled to stay in Beijing for three days.

On the morning of the 6th, they will present flags to the various headquarters under the Ministry of National Defense. In the afternoon, they will visit various agencies separately. They will leave Beijing on the 8th and go to the front line to慰勞 the soldiers.

### Security Council Debates Berlin Incident Soviet Union Opposes Inclusion on Agenda Three Powers' Reply to Soviet Note Is Cold Insisting that Lifting the Blockade Is a Prerequisite for Resuming Negotiations

[Our Newspaper] Paris Fourth Broadcast: The United Nations Security Council announced the opening of the meeting at 3:12 PM on the afternoon of the 4th in a tense atmosphere to discuss the case of the Western powers accusing the Soviet Union of threatening world peace by blockading Berlin. After the meeting began, the US representative, Austin, stated that the United States, as one of the parties to the dispute, should avoid the position of chairman in the discussion of this case. According to precedent, the chairmanship should be handed over to Argentina. However, because Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia is now in his home country, it is generally implied that Argentina will also transfer the chairmanship to a representative of another country. At the beginning of the debate, Soviet representative Vyshinsky pointed out that the Security Council has no right to interfere in the dispute between the East and West. He also said that the Soviet Union believes that the accusations of the Western powers are unfounded and beyond the scope of the Security Council's authority, so they should not be discussed in the Security Council. But the US representative replied coldly that, in any case, the Western powers will insist on their accusations to the end and formally rejected the Soviet Union's recent note suggesting that a four-power foreign ministers' meeting be convened to discuss the Berlin issue. The representative said that "the Soviet Union still refuses to lift the Berlin blockade and is still threatening world peace."

[Our Newspaper] Paris Fourth Broadcast: Vyshinsky said in the Security Council that the United Nations' discussion of the Berlin issue violated the Potsdam Agreement, and the Soviet Union "does not want to be a party to this violation." Vyshinsky said, "We oppose placing this case on the agenda and insist that this agenda should not be adopted."

[Our Newspaper] Paris Fourth Broadcast: After the Security Council adjourned, a reporter asked Vyshinsky, "If the Berlin issue is placed on the agenda, how will you deal with it?" Vyshinsky smiled and replied, "Don't worry, everything will be clear at the appropriate time." After saying that, he shook hands with the reporter, jumped into the car, and left in a hurry.

[Our Newspaper] Paris Fourth Broadcast: US Secretary of State Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin discussed the German issue with their advisors on the morning of the 4th and planned to meet with French Foreign Minister Schumann during the Security Council meeting in the afternoon. It was also reported that the three-power meeting ended at 5:40 PM in the afternoon, and the situation of the meeting was not revealed.

[United Press Paris Fourth Dispatch] The United States, Britain, and France decided on the 4th to reject the Soviet Union's suggestion to convene a new foreign ministers' meeting unless the Berlin blockade can be lifted unconditionally. A spokesperson for the three Western powers announced the Western position as follows: "No negotiations until the blockade is lifted. The blockade is the theme of everything." The Soviet Union broadcast its suggestion from Moscow Radio on the morning of the 4th and formally submitted it to the Western headquarters before noon to avoid the Security Council's debate on the Berlin issue at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, so the West announced its position in reply.

### Soviet Union Requests Convening New Foreign Ministers' Meeting To Discuss Entire German Issue Accuses West of Violating Agreements and Undermining German Unity

[United Press Paris Fourth Dispatch] The Soviet Union today demanded that the three Western powers hand over the entire German issue to the foreign ministers' meeting to avoid the Security Council's debate on the Berlin incident. A few hours before the Security Council was scheduled to meet at 3:00 PM this afternoon, Moscow Radio suddenly broadcast the Soviet Union's reply to the Western note of September 26, proposing the above suggestion. According to the Western note, the Soviet government was notified that the three countries had decided to abandon negotiations and submit the matter to the Security Council for arbitration. The Soviet reply insisted that the Moscow negotiations decided to issue instructions to the military governors of the four countries stationed in Germany, so the blockade issue had been resolved. It also said that the three Western powers should abide by the Moscow decision and should not arbitrarily use it to endanger the Soviet rights in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany.

Moscow claimed that the Soviet Union requested that the East German Mark be recognized as the sole currency in Berlin, but this was only one of the conditions for lifting the blockade. However, the Western countries obstructed it by demanding that the four powers control the issuance of the Soviet Mark, which obviously endangers Soviet rights in the Soviet zone. The Soviet reply is expected to form the general tone of the Soviet representative's efforts in the Security Council to cancel the Berlin issue on the agenda. The Soviet reply argued that the Western zone's currency reform would affect the Soviet zone, so the Soviet Union had no choice but to blockade Berlin to protect itself. The Soviet Union also said that the Western zone's currency reform was only one of the many ways in which the West violated the Potsdam Agreement on a unified Germany and attempted to establish an independent West Germany. The Soviet reply also said, "The Berlin issue is closely related to the entire German issue and the establishment of a separate government in West Germany. According to Article 107 of the United Nations Charter, this matter should be handled by the countries responsible for occupying Germany and does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Security Council." The Soviet note ended by requesting that a foreign ministers' meeting be convened "according to the Potsdam four-power agreement" to consider the Berlin issue and the entire German issue. The Soviet reply acknowledged that the Soviet commander in Berlin had requested jurisdiction over the Western airlift in order to prevent black market money transactions between the East and West zones, which was unavoidable. "Because the governments of the United States, Britain, and France refused to implement the instructions, the negotiations failed even though the remaining differences were not very important." The note also said that the West demanded to interfere with the Soviet Union's banknote printing figures and attempted "to finally expel the Soviet Union" from the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany.

### Italian-Greek Trade Negotiations

[French News Agency Rome Third Dispatch] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza today denied rumors that he will meet with Greek Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsaldaris in the near future to negotiate an Italian-Greek mutual defense treaty.

### Negev Transferred to Arab States Israel Opposes

Says It Could Reignite Holy Land Warfare

[Our Newspaper] Paris Fourth Broadcast: The Israeli government formally protested to the United Nations on the 4th against Bernadotte's proposal to transfer the Negev to the Arabs.

### Belgian Defense Minister Says War Unlikely to Occur

[United Press Brussels Fourth Dispatch] Belgian Defense Minister Colonel Friart said on the 4th that there is no "danger" of a world war at present, and people should not panic because of the military measures taken by Britain. "On the contrary, this move is enough to stabilize the world situation." The colonel also said that the best guarantee of peace is a strong defense organization.

### Atomic Control Issue Continues to Be Debated Manuilsky Criticizes the United States Swedish Representative Urges Great Powers to Negotiate for a Solution

[United Press Paris Fourth Dispatch] Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky continued the Soviet side's attack on the West in the UN General Assembly Political Committee on the 4th, extending from atomic warfare policy to personal slander. Manuilsky ridiculed the United States' "generous giving" in atomic energy and accused President Truman of aiming to maintain the United States' monopoly on atomic bombs to launch a new war. He said that the US New Deal has been destroyed by Wall Street, and the New Deal faction in the West has been replaced by warmongers who have abandoned all international agreements with atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.

He accused US officials, including Truman, of being insincere. While US representative Austin made generous statements in the Security Council about the generous giving of atomic energy, Truman and military leaders made contrary statements. Manuilsky said that the United States demands that other countries sacrifice sovereignty in atomic energy, while it itself refuses to give up a single bit of sovereignty. "This is a narrow selfishness, but it is issued in the name of the American plan. If other countries retaliate and propose plans to make the United States give up sovereignty, then what will the United States say?" Manuilsky severely criticized the West for "not understanding the Soviet Union and not seeking to understand it," collecting information from the "garbage can" of White Russian exiles and Hitler's allies. He indirectly accused Western military attachés stationed in the Soviet Union of being responsible for espionage activities and said that if the West wants to understand the Soviet Union's internal affairs, it should consult "Western military attachés who sometimes carry cameras to visit our facilities." He announced that the United States' plan to control the atom "is fundamentally unacceptable." He also accused the US proposal of aiming to win overwhelming support from the UN General Assembly so that the United States could concentrate on manufacturing atomic bombs and recklessly prepare for a new war. Swedish representative Sandström declared that the Soviet Union's atomic control plan was not satisfactory, but still urged the great powers to continue negotiations.

### Commander of Western European Allied Forces France Suggests That He Be a US General

It is speculated that the meeting will discuss the position of commander of the Western European Allied Forces.

[United Press Paris Fourth Dispatch] It is reported that the French government is putting pressure on Britain, demanding that Britain agree to appoint a US general as commander of the Western European Allied Forces to replace Field Marshal Montgomery. It is also reported that France insists that the Standing Military Committee of the Western European Union be located in Paris and not in London.

[United Press Eglin Air Force Base, Florida Third Dispatch] Nine thousand troops and five hundred of the best aircraft from the US Army, Navy, and Air Force have gathered here on the 3rd to begin an important war combat exercise. The exercise began on the 3rd and is the first most important US demonstration of strength since the war. The tense situation in Europe has made it necessary for the United States to increase its strength. This exercise will last for three days to demonstrate new combat techniques, that is, the Army, Navy, and Air Force jointly launching a blitzkrieg attack on the target. Among them, 3,000 are students from the Air Force University, Staff College, Infantry Center Station, Radar School, and Marine Corps School. It is generally hoped that they can gain valuable experience. The area of ​​this exercise will cover three states (Florida, Alabama, and Georgia), including the latest jet aircraft, B-29 Superfortresses, and new aircraft of the Navy and Army. The Navy will send 100 aircraft from aircraft carriers, 100 Marine Corps fighters and attack fighters.

### Yugoslavia Declares Policy

Determined Not to Abandon Revolutionary Achievements, Refuses to Make Peace with Western Powers

[French News Agency Belgrade Third Dispatch] The Yugoslav Communist Party's organ newspaper today continued to publish several documents related to the dispute between the Yugoslav Communist Party and the Communist Information Bureau, sternly refusing Yugoslavia's reconciliation with the Western powers. The Yugoslav Communist Party's organ newspaper pointed out that Yugoslavia cannot cooperate with countries dependent on "imperialist" plans, and Yugoslav leaders will never abandon the achievements of the revolution. The newspaper also refuted other democratic countries' accusations of Yugoslavia, which are not based on facts and are purely due to selfish motives. The newspaper also disagreed with the view of some Soviet leaders that "any people's democratic country cannot survive after leaving the 'democratic front'." The newspaper pointed out that Yugoslavia already possesses all the prerequisites for a socialist economy. The isolation of other people's democratic countries by Yugoslavia may provoke "imperialists" to launch an aggression, but this kind of war can never be limited to the local area, and whether other people's democratic countries subjectively want to or not, they will eventually be forced into war. Finally, the newspaper replied to Pravda's accusation of political terror in Belgrade, stating that from beginning to end, only 50 people have been arrested for treasonous acts.

Brazilian authorities plan to send Gessuva back to Europe on the original ship.

### Strikes in France and Italy: French Coal Miners Strike to Protest Government Layoffs; Italian Communist Party Calls on Farmers to Persist in Demanding Wage Increases

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 4th] 300,000 French coal miners began a general strike this morning to protest the Guy Mollet government's layoff order. As of now, no accidents have occurred. It is expected that some tin miners will also join the strike. In this strike, the General Confederation of Labor, led by the Communist Party, and the Christian Labor Union have quite different attitudes. The Communist-led General Confederation of Labor advocates an indefinite strike, while the Christian Labor Union advocates a 48-hour strike and attempts to reach an agreement with Economic Minister Lacoste. If a prolonged strike occurs, all economic activity in France will inevitably be paralyzed. French coal mines are state-owned, and Premier Guy Mollet has decided to reduce the number of government-affiliated workers as part of an economic plan.

[United Press, Rome, 3rd] Communist labor leaders on the 3rd demanded that all workers in Rome hold a 15-minute sympathy strike on the 4th to support the 14,000 Rome city government employees who have been on strike for ten days. All businesses and offices are scheduled to close after lunch and stop working, so this strike will not affect the city's commerce, but public transportation will be disrupted. As labor leaders announced the "sympathy demonstration" plan, Communist newspapers declared that farmers across Italy would hold a meeting next week to support their demands for increased wages. At the same time, emergency sanitation crews were dispatched in Rome on the 3rd to clear garbage from the streets.

### Authorities Suppress the Unhealthy Trend of Competitive Buying: Rationing Certificates for Woolen Cloth; Restrictions on Silk, Shirts, Trousers, etc. Will Also Be Implemented; Strict Thrift—No Meat Allowed on Fridays

[Report from this newspaper] The trend of competitive buying did not abate yesterday. Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian visited Supervising Commissioner Jiang Jingguo yesterday morning to discuss countermeasures, holding lengthy talks. According to Director Wu, it has been decided to implement a policy of periodic and quantitative rationing of essential goods as a temporary measure before the widespread implementation of a goods allocation system. All citizens purchasing essential goods must present their national identification cards. In addition to wool yarn, which is already subject to certificate-based rationing (1.5 pounds of coarse yarn and 1 pound of fine yarn), woolen cloth and fabrics will be limited to 1.5 zhang (approximately 5 meters) per person. Woolen cloth will be limited to one purchase per year, and fabrics to one purchase every three months, both based on presentation of a city national identification card. Purchases will be stamped on the back of the national identification card to prevent repeat purchases. The Social Affairs Bureau has instructed the relevant trade associations to implement this policy starting today. Silk and satin materials are also planned to be restricted soon, limited to one item per person. In the future, daily necessities such as shirts, undershirts, and socks will also be prepared for restricted purchase to curb panic buying.

[Another report] According to Director Wu, restricting meat consumption in the city has been verbally agreed upon by Commissioner Jiang and Mayor Wu. It is planned to imitate the American practice of not eating meat every Friday. On that day, the sale of pork, beef, and mutton will be prohibited, slaughterhouses will suspend slaughtering, markets will not supply meat, and restaurants will also stop selling meat dishes. This measure will be enforced strictly. Once Mayor Wu formally approves it, it will be implemented immediately.

### Citizens Still Crowd to Buy Goods

[Report from this newspaper] The objects of citizens' panic buying have expanded from daily necessities to everything. Department stores on Nanjing Road are crowded with men and women. Shirts, bedsheets, children's clothing, cosmetics, silk, woolen cloth, towels, socks, cotton and woolen shirts and trousers, etc., are all being snapped up. Even large companies like Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, and The New Sun are out of all sizes of shirts. Display windows in watch shops no longer have brand-name watches on display; when asked, they say they have been sold out. The Parker pens that were once ubiquitous are now nowhere to be found in bookstores and stationery stores on Fuzhou Road. Even domestic pens such as Hua Fu, Golden Star, and Guan Le Ming are hard to come by. Camera stores no longer have Leica, Contax, Rolleiflex, and other valuable cameras, and various films are also being bought in bulk for storage. Even unpopular and outdated items like electric refrigerators still have buyers.

### Many "Single-Carriers" on Trains: Measures Will Be Taken to Stop Them

[Report from this newspaper] Along with the panic buying comes the rampant "single-carriers" (individuals carrying goods for resale) on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Because price-controlled goods in Shanghai can be sold for many times their price with just a short trip out of the station, all first, second, and third-class passenger cars on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, except for reserved-seat cars, are packed to the brim. The cars are filled with large and small packages everywhere, resembling "freight cars." The Office of the Supervising Commissioner has paid close attention to this phenomenon and will soon implement measures to inspect and stop it. If military personnel are found to be engaged in "single-carrying" activities, military police will be dispatched to arrest and severely punish them.

### Merchants Seek Profits Regardless of Hygiene: Rotten Pork and Stinky Fish Discovered; Authorities Strive to Rectify

[Report from this newspaper] In the city's small vegetable markets, the supply of pork has increased slightly recently due to the increase in the number of pigs arriving by ship, but demand still exceeds supply. Now, cities along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and rural areas near the city, having learned of the meat shortage in Shanghai, are trying to smuggle pork into Shanghai. Most of it is sold to restaurants at black market prices. It is rumored that some of this pork includes "sick pigs," "dead pigs," and "plague pigs." However, according to the Health Bureau, rural residents transport meat to Shanghai for profit, mostly in small quantities, which is essentially smuggling. They try every means to evade inspectors. After reaching the city, they directly trade with restaurants, so it is difficult to inspect whether the meat sold by restaurants is completely clean. In the future, we can only urge restaurants and citizens to pay close attention and not be greedy for small gains and eat meat that has not been inspected. At the same time, the bureau will formulate measures to strengthen inspections to ensure the health of citizens during this meat shortage.

Vegetables Often Have Water Added; Chicken Gizzards Have Cement

The supply of ordinary vegetables remains the same as before, but the price-controlled vegetables are all inferior goods and are often diluted with water and shortchanged. To buy better vegetables, citizens have been accustomed to paying black market prices, so the price-controlled signs in each vegetable market are equivalent to empty words. Chickens were once nowhere to be found, but recently a large number of chickens suddenly appeared in some vegetable markets. At first, citizens rushed to buy them. But after buying and slaughtering them, they found more than a catty of cement in the chicken gizzards, and it had hardened into a lump. It is rumored that this new method has not been invented for long. The root cause is that chicken vendors, restricted by price controls, had an innovative idea. One or two hours before selling, they mixed cement powder and water with bran, rubbed it into thin strips, and forcefully stuffed it into the chicken's head to increase its weight. These chickens die one or two hours after swallowing the cement powder, but citizens cannot detect it when weighing and buying.

The Office of the Supervising Commissioner is paying close attention to the practice of fish markets selling stinky fish along with good fish and will convene relevant personnel in the coming days to discuss a thorough rectification of the fish markets.

### Manufacturers Suggest Authorities Allocate Edible Oil Directly

To prevent panic buying in the market and affect inventory, Qiu Liangrong, chairman of the Shanghai District Vegetable Oil Refining Industry Association, directors Li Tingdong and Zhou Weibai, and others paid a visit to Commissioner Jiang yesterday to make a request. Commissioner Jiang was out on official business, so Secretary Cai Baili met with them on his behalf. Qiu and Li reported the actual situation in the market in detail, saying that the current edible oil inventory totals 200,000 dan (approximately 10,000 tons), which is sufficient for five months based on the population of Shanghai. Furthermore, manufacturers jointly sold 3,000 dan in the market last Saturday, but it was all snatched up. The panic buying is even more intense today (the 4th). If a way to eradicate this is not found, the future is worrying. Secretary Cai accepted Qiu and Li's suggestion to cancel market transactions and adopt a direct allocation method, which will be handled by the Civil Affairs Commission. It will be implemented after being reported to Commissioner Jiang for approval.

### City Industrial Association Holds Symposium to Discuss Raw Material Supply Issues

[Report from this newspaper] The City Industrial Association convened responsible persons from trade associations throughout the city yesterday to hold a symposium to discuss the supply of industrial raw materials and ways to dredge the source. It was decided to first select one of the most essential and most difficult raw materials for each industry, specifying the quantity needed, the place of origin, the difficulties in purchasing, and solutions, and submit it to the Industrial Association before 10:00 a.m. today for reporting to the Materials Adjustment Committee.

### Economic Police Summon Fish Merchants Yesterday to Discuss Fresh Fish Supply Issues

The Economic Police Brigade of the Police Bureau summoned Tang Chengzong, general manager of the fish market, Luo Ruichang, chairman of the Fish Vendor United Benefit Association, and Yu Jingwei, a broker, to the bureau yesterday to discuss fresh fish supply issues. It was decided that fish market transactions will be directly negotiated between fish vendors and the fish market. Brokers can only buy and sell on behalf of customers and collect commissions and cannot wholesale. The detailed methods will be decided when the Social Affairs Bureau convenes a meeting. Furthermore, Tang Wujing and Le Jintang, two "yellow cattle" (scalpers) in the fish market who were arrested yesterday for sheltering fish cargo, have been released on bail after providing a written guarantee.

### Two Supervising Commissioners Confer Yesterday Regarding the Expansion of the Economic Control Commission

[Report from this newspaper] Commissioners Yu and Jiang held an important meeting yesterday morning, focusing on the expanded economic control meeting to be held on the 7th of this month. As of yesterday, formal invitations to the chairmen of the three provinces and the mayors of the two cities had not yet been issued, but relevant sources said that the preparation time does not feel rushed.

### Jiang Jingguo Sets an Example by Moving Out of the Former Enemy Property

[Report from this newspaper] According to Secretary Gao Liwen: Jiang Jingguo, for the convenience of the China Trust Bureau's handling, has voluntarily moved out of the enemy property at No. 2 Yicun a few days ago and moved to an apartment in the former French Concession. The former residence is planned to be returned to the enemy property office of the China Trust Bureau in the coming days.

### Negotiating with Niece-in-law to Donate Funds: Family Dispute Leads to This

[Report from this newspaper] Zheng Xuezhu, a young woman from Ningbo and niece of the late Shanghai tycoon Yu Qiaqing, went to the Central Bank at 11:00 a.m. yesterday to visit Jiang Jingguo, stating that she wanted to donate 11 taels and 8 liang of gold, which she received as inheritance. It happened that Jiang was out on official business, so Secretary Gao met with her on his behalf and promised to pass on her intention. However, the Office of the Supervising Commissioner later learned that there was a family dispute involved. Although this gold should nominally belong to Zheng, her custodian refused to hand it over. In anger, Zheng decided to donate it, believing that what private individuals cannot obtain, the state must have a way to obtain.

### Finance and Economy on the Right Track: Deposits in Commercial Banks and Firms Increase Sharply, Reaching 240 Million Gold Yuan

[Report from this newspaper] According to relevant sources: Since the currency reform, the economic and financial situation has gradually been getting on the right track. For example, the total number of commercial bank and firm deposits in Shanghai on August 19th was approximately equivalent to 6 million gold yuan, while the total value of deposits at the end of September has reached a staggering 240 million gold yuan, the speed of increase being extremely alarming. The exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency has indeed increased the issuance of gold yuan, but on the other hand, the government is still working to contract the currency. For example, since the issuance of state-owned enterprise stocks, nearly 5 million gold yuan have been sold. The sale of materials and the issuance of short-term gold yuan treasury bills have also recovered the equivalent of 10 million U.S. dollars in currency, both of which are considerable amounts. At the same time, to strengthen the tightening of funds, the government may implement methods such as stock collateral and deposit deposits in the future. Therefore, although the currency issuance exceeds 900 million gold yuan, the floating funds in the market are not as large as imagined.

No Shortage of Major Materials

As for the inventory of industrial raw materials and daily necessities, it is particularly abundant. The panic buying in the market in the past two days is entirely due to a psychological illusion. Taking raw cotton as an example, American cotton can meet 60% of the demand. The remaining 40% is also guaranteed to be obtained if there are no transportation problems. The Central Bank recently plans to purchase 2.5 million dan of domestic cotton, so there is no shortage of raw cotton in Shanghai. Regarding flour, it has been decided to purchase wheat seeds from the United States instead of finished products so that Shanghai's flour mills can fully operate. According to statistics from the competent authorities, at the beginning of the victory, the cotton cloth inventory was only 2 million bolts, but now it has increased to 6.5 million bolts, which can supply the city for half a year. The current inventory of cotton yarn is 100,000 bales. In the past, 40,000 bales were consumed each month, but only 10,000 bales were consumed last month. Conservatively calculated, it can be maintained for at least three months. The inventory of edible oil is also very abundant, and the current inventory of sugar is 80,000 tons, while the national consumption is only 10,000 tons.

Optimistic Prospects for Rice and Coal Supply

As for the supply of staple food, rice, American rice and Taiwanese rice already account for 42% of the total demand, and the remainder can be purchased from nearby producing areas. According to current statistics, the rice inventory in Shanghai's rice shops is 270,000 zu (a unit of measurement), and there are still private stockpiles, but due to the scattered nature, it is difficult to count. In the future, Shanghai can transport surplus materials out to exchange for food from various places. In terms of coal, the source of power, the situation is also very optimistic. After the connection of the Pingxiang-Zhuzhou Railway, Pingxiang coal can be supplied in large quantities in the same way as Taiwanese coal and Kailuan coal, so there is no fear of a coal shortage in Shanghai. In summary, whether from a financial or material point of view, the future of Shanghai's economic management is very bright. It is hoped that citizens can maintain confidence and avoid unnecessary disturbances.

### Three Merchants Detained for Raising Prices

### Comprehensive Survey of Seven Registered Materials to Begin Tomorrow: Those Whose Quantities Do Not Match, Conceal or Fail to Report Will Be Investigated

[Report from this newspaper] The economic control authorities, based on the materials registered with the Social Affairs Bureau, will launch a comprehensive inspection starting tomorrow, which is scheduled to be completed within two days. Police sub-bureaus, the Anti-Construction Brigade, and the Greater Shanghai Youth Service Team were ordered yesterday to actively prepare. It is estimated that the number of people mobilized at that time will be more than 5,000, divided into 1,634 groups, with Yu Shuping, director of the bureau, as the commander-in-chief. Under the commander-in-chief, according to the police bureau's district division, there are 30 brigades, including Huangpu, Songshan, Lao Zha, Xincheng, Yangshupu, Hongkou, Tilanqiao, Lujiawan, Jianlin, North Station, Yimiao, Changshu, Xujiahui, Xinqing, Penglai, North Sichuan Road, Zhabei, Jing'an Temple, Jiangning, Putuo, Sicheng, Yangjing, Zhenru, Xinshijie, Gaoqiao, Jiangwan, Dachang, and Longhua. The chiefs of each police sub-bureau will serve as the brigade commander. Under the brigade commander, there are seven teams divided according to the category of materials. The team leaders are selected by the heads of each division. The teams are divided into groups, with three members in each group, including one police officer, one member of the Anti-Construction Team, and one member of the Youth Corps. The registered materials for this inspection include: (1) Rice, (2) Flour, (3) Cotton yarn, (4) Cotton cloth, (5) Edible oil, (6) Industrial raw materials, and (7) Paper. If discrepancies are found between the registered quantities or concealment or failure to report, the commander-in-chief will report to the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervising Commissioner's Office for legal investigation.

### Forging Investigation Report: Auditors of the Gold Control Bureau Indicted

[Report from this newspaper] Xia Peide, an auditor of the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, was assigned in mid-July this year to inspect the Shanghai branch of Qichang Bank's large loan customers and the truth about the bank's overdue exchange on the 12th of the same month. However, Xia forged an investigation report and extorted four gold bars from Li Zijing, the manager of the bank. At the same time, he secretly talked with Wei Zhonghuai, the deputy manager of the bank, several times and had secret correspondence, which was suspected of colluding and engaging in malpractice. After the Gold Control Bureau discovered this, it transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. However, Xia and Wei both avoided appearing. The District Prosecutor's Office has now concluded its investigation of this case and has filed a public prosecution against the two defendants on charges of corruption.

### Silver Shops Request Suspension of Business: Social Affairs Bureau Approves

[Report from this newspaper] Due to the fact that supply could not meet demand and raw materials were cut off, the Silver Shop Association convened a board meeting yesterday morning and decided to submit a document to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting a suspension of business from today. According to Director Wu Kaixian: The Executive Yuan has not yet announced the regulations on the exchange of jewelry gold, and there is no basis for operation, so the request for temporary suspension of business has been approved.

### Approved New Prices for Yizhong Cigarettes: Approximately Doubled; Supplementary Approval for Four Types of Domestic Cigarettes

[Report from this newspaper] The new prices of various brands of cigarettes from Yizhong Tobacco Company after the tax increase were approved by the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, which is about double the original price. Cigarette stores will resume sales starting today. Among them, Big Capstan, Three Cannons, and Ten and Twenty Big Front Door, four types of high-end cigarettes, are priced higher because the raw materials are better and the foreign exchange difference required is also greater, with the company's application approved by Director Wu. The new prices for each brand are as follows:

Name Wholesale Price Retail Price

(Per Carton) (Per Pack)

(Gold Yuan) (Gold Yuan)

Twenty Big Capstan 8.57 0.95

Twenty Three Cannons 7.94 0.90

### Social Affairs Bureau to Discuss Prices of Imported Cigarettes Today

[Report from this newspaper] After the adjustment of the tobacco and alcohol tax, the new prices of cigarettes from various factories in the city have been approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. However, since imported cigarettes are not manufactured in Shanghai, no ex-factory tax is levied, so their prices are lower than the new prices of high-end cigarettes produced locally. Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian believes that this will force the closure of various tobacco factories in the city. He consulted with Shi Shouzhang, director of the Commodity Tax Bureau, twice yesterday about this matter. According to Director Wu: Although the import of imported cigarettes is currently restricted, the Materials Supply Bureau has thousands of large boxes in stock, which is enough for the city for half a year. To save the city's tobacco factories, in principle, imported cigarettes will be allowed to increase in price. The Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a detailed discussion on this matter with the Commodity Tax Bureau and the Materials Supply Bureau this afternoon.

### This Month's Rice Allocation: Whole and Broken Rice Mixed; 15 Jin (Approximately 7.5 kg) for 9 Jiao 6 Fen; Allocation Begins on the 16th

The Civil Affairs Commission recently stipulated that, starting in October, the poverty status of all those previously investigated and registered will be completely cancelled, and a new method will be determined to sell whole and broken rice mixed together. The mixing ratio is 80% whole rice and 20% broken rice, totaling 15 city jin (approximately 7.5 kg), priced at 9 jiao and 6 fen in gold yuan.

Furthermore, due to the extremely cumbersome procedures for this month's rice allocation, it will not be possible to transport it in batches until mid-month, so the Civil Affairs Commission has decided that the above method will begin to be allocated starting on the 16th. However, between the 6th and the 15th, the commission will allocate 60,000 shi (a unit of measurement) of broken rice, with an allocation price of 5 jiao 3 fen 3 li per city dou (a unit of measurement).

### Newspaper Reporters Association: Meeting of Standing Council and Group Leaders

The Standing Council and group leaders of the third council of the Newspaper Reporters Association of this city held their third regular meeting at the Shen Bao Weiqi Conference Room at 5:00 p.m. on the 4th. The chairman was Luo Dunwei. (1) Chief of the General Affairs Group Bu reported, "According to the resolution of the General Assembly, the issuance of membership cards to members and the publication of a member directory are being handled. We are now organizing the membership registration and have prepared registration forms and membership card samples for your review." (2) Deputy Chief of the Welfare Group Sun Daosheng reported: "According to the last meeting, we contacted the China Textile Company to allocate wool cloth to members. We have negotiated with Deputy General Manager Wu Weijing, who has assigned the Business Department to handle it. The method is that the company will cut samples and quote prices, which are particularly low, and then the number of orders will be certified by our association, and each newspaper will apply for purchase on its own." Next, important cases were discussed, and the following resolutions were made: (1) Li Zikuan, a member of the Newspaper Building Committee, applied to resign because he also served as a member of the Newspaper Building Committee of the Newspaper Association and could not take care of both. It was resolved to replace him with Supervisor Tang Shichang. (2) The Membership Qualification Review Committee appointed Fu Hou, Chief of the Organization Group, as the convener. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m.

### Sharp Increase in Cases of Shops Evading Taxes: Over 1,000 Cases Discovered in Ten Days

The Commodity Tax Bureau Strengthens Inspection Work

After the currency reform, from September 20th to the end of the same month, the Shanghai District Direct Tax Bureau discovered more than 1,700 cases of unpaid taxes in ten days, which were transferred to the District Court for separate fines and time-limited recovery. Before the currency reform, there were only over 100 cases per month.

Furthermore, after receiving orders to increase taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, etc., Shi Shouzhang, director of the Shanghai Commodity Tax Bureau, in order to prevent tax evasion and increase tax revenue, specially convened a meeting of responsible persons from various sections and offices yesterday and decided to strengthen inspection work and strictly prevent tax evasion.

### A Buying Frenzy Occurs in the Market Due to Unhealthy Psychological Factors; Chiang Ching-kuo Instructs Cadres to Have a High Degree of Political Awareness

Chiang Ching-kuo, the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisor, yesterday convened a meeting of the members of the Pacification and Construction Brigade and the Youth Service Corps to give instructions, encouraging them to have a high degree of political awareness and organizational concepts. He cited statistical figures, pointing out that in the past month and a half, Shanghai's market has undergone a qualitative change. Before "August 19th," the total deposits of Shanghai's commercial banks were 6.5 million gold yuan, while last week's total deposits exceeded 212 million gold yuan. This capital was previously used to speculate in the market, stirring up trouble. The elimination of market speculation indicates that the nature of the market has changed. However, in addition to eliminating speculation, active efforts should be made to increase production. He cited the city's largest cotton yarn and cigarette industries as examples, explaining that although these two industries are not mechanical industries, they have a solid foundation and scale in Shanghai's industrial sector. In order to maintain the workers' livelihoods and market stability, the government has taken measures to protect them, and there is absolutely no problem with the supply of raw materials.

The Fish Market Will Also Be Abolished

At this point, he instructed in a very frank tone that the goal we are pursuing today is a social revolution with profound historical significance. The basic requirements are, first, to reverse the previous phenomenon of the poor getting poorer and the rich getting richer, and to ensure that the poor obtain a livelihood. Second, it is necessary to eliminate middlemen who exploit without labor. Third, it is necessary to ensure the producers' livelihood. In explaining these three goals, he stated firmly that after abolishing the cotton cloth market, the government would continue to abolish the fish market, making producers and consumers closer and closer, avoiding the heavy exploitation of middlemen and taking advantage of opportunities to stir up trouble, manipulate speculation, and harm people's livelihoods. He also believes that this action is revolutionary work and encouraged comrades to have a high degree of political literacy and organizational concepts to firmly implement it. Regarding the recent buying spree in the city, he believes that it is caused by unhealthy psychological factors of idlers, and he said that after the cigarette tax is increased, the government can increase its revenue by 34 million gold yuan per month.

No Shortage of Daily Necessities

As for daily necessities such as rice, oil, sugar, and coal, everything remains the same, and their reserves are sufficient. The oil supply can last for four months, the sugar reserves are 80,000 tons, enough for eight months, the cloth reserves are 6.2 million bolts, enough for the whole country for half a year, and the yarn reserves are 90,000 bales, so there is no fear of shortage. The reason why some people are worried all day long is that they lack combat training and experience, and they are used to a comfortable life, so they are panicked when they encounter changes. But according to the actual situation, there is no reason to panic. He also revealed that civil servants and workers in the city will be rationed salt, oil, rice, coal, sugar, and cloth starting from November 1st, and the preparation work can be completed within this month to ensure the producers' livelihoods. Finally, he warned his comrades that we have not yet encountered the real main force of the enemy, and we must be cautious to complete our sacred mission. He placed high hopes on the Youth Service Corps, saying that political training must be started to make them understand the purpose of the revolution and become loyal believers of the leader to engage in social reform.

Yesterday, more than fifty students from National Sichuan University responded in a letter, hoping that Chiang could lead the youth of the country to work hard together.

### Private Cars Are Still Allowed to Be Transferred; Oil Rationing for City Councilors Is Not Reduced

[Our Newspaper] The City Council passed the proposal to lift the restrictions on cars in the sixth general assembly. After the city government submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval, it is now known that the Executive Yuan has approved it and still maintains the resolution of the third meeting of the thrift supervision committee, "The transfer is approved, but the transferee should be limited to those who are eligible to use cars according to the original regulations on restricting private use of cars," that is, registered banks, factories, mines, and large-scale private enterprises related to people's daily necessities, as well as registered doctors.

According to the person in charge of the Public Utilities Bureau, the amount of oil allocated to cars owned by city councilors should also be reduced according to the central government's regulations, but because the situation in Shanghai is special and the city councilors are busy with meetings, the mayor has specially approved that the amount of oil allocated to them will not be reduced temporarily. The number of motorized bicycles will not be reduced for the time being, and the amount of oil allocated to them will still be maintained at eight gallons per month.

[Another News] In order to strictly enforce the conservation of gasoline for cars in this city, the Automobile Gasoline Conservation Review Committee has decided on interim measures. It is now known that car owners whose gasoline has been reduced can apply for adjustment of the oil allocation according to Article 4 of the original method. Before the end of October, they can purchase application forms from the Fourth Department of the Public Utilities Bureau and submit them to the Public Utilities Bureau for review by the Review Committee together with the documents to be submitted.

### A Fire on Ximen Road Completely Destroyed the Xieping Factory; Affected the Neighboring Xiangyun Factory; Thirteen Firefighters Were Injured

[Our Newspaper] At about 10:54 a.m. yesterday, a three-story loft motor room of the Xieping Weaving Factory at No. 115, Lane 239 (that is, Tianheli), Ximen Road, caught fire due to excessive heat. Sparks entered the raw wool and cotton, causing a sudden fire. After receiving the report, the Fire Department immediately sent Fire Department Director Zhou Zhaoxiang, Detachment Commander Zhang Xuan, Section Chief Ye Binyong, and others to lead the pump truck to put out the fire. Subsequently, the Songshan Xinkaihe District Team Department and the West District Fire Brigade also rushed to assist with multiple belt trucks. However, the surrounding dangerous walls were towering, making it impossible to pour water. Although the firefighters and police climbed the ladder and looked down from a high position, they still could not extinguish the fire. In a short time, the adjacent Xiangyun Electrical Sock Factory at No. 114 was affected. Li Changsheng, the central district team commander, first climbed onto the dangerous wall and sprayed water remotely. All firefighters and police officers rushed into the flames to rescue regardless of their own safety. Unexpectedly, the wall bricks were loosened by the fire and collapsed immediately, injuring police officers Li Changsheng, Sun Lin, Qiu Dezhong, Wang Yuchu, Shen Guitang, Guo Dego, Wu Guoqiang, Zhou Jinzhong, Lu Qiliang, Ma Guojun, Zhu Bingyan, Xu Shigen, and Zhang Chaosheng. All thirteen were sent to the police hospital for treatment. The fire was extinguished at 1:40 p.m. It is reported that in addition to the complete destruction of the Xieping Factory, half of the Xiangyun Factory was also burned. After the incident, Xieping Factory Manager Huang Rongqing and Chief Accountant Ye Guoqing were summoned by the bureau to investigate the responsibility for the fire.

### Yangtze Company's Goods Were Registered Long Ago

Kong Lingkan Has Not Left Shanghai

It was recently reported that a large number of materials seized by the inspection authorities from the Liham Automobile Company on the thirteenth floor were hoarded by the Yangtze Company. According to reporters, only a portion of the materials belongs to the Yangtze Company. Most of them are vitamins and DDT raw materials. According to the police bureau, the above-mentioned materials have been registered with the Social Affairs Bureau. The previous report that a large number of cars and parts sufficient to assemble hundreds of cars were seized is absolutely untrue. As for Kong Lingkan, the person in charge of the Yangtze Company, he is still in Shanghai.

### Three Defendants Implicated in Qi Zaiyu's Case Await Judgment; Jin Runsheng Testified That He Had Contacted to Bail Wu Baokang; Jiang Shilin Tried to Deny Receiving Bribes and Was Allowed to Be Released on Bail

[Our Newspaper] Jin Runsheng (also known as Jin Tuozi), Yu Shunhua, and Jiang Shilin, who were involved in the corruption case of Qi Zaiyu, the former head of the Sixth Investigation Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters, were transferred to the District Court for trial because they did not have military status. The preliminary hearing was held by Presiding Judge Zhu Yuhuang at 2:30 p.m. yesterday.

Did Not Purchase Goods or Components

Jin Runsheng responded to the court's inquiry, stating: He did not hold any position in the Garrison Headquarters, nor was he a member of the Sixth Investigation Brigade. However, he had contacts with some personnel of the headquarters. He knew Qi Zaiyu's wife during the war, so he sometimes visited Qi's family. One day last winter, a relative of Wu Baokang, a Ding, visited him at home several times, saying that Wu was arrested by the Garrison Department and asked him to inquire about the reasons for the arrest. Later, he learned that Wu Baokang had been reported to have searched and purchased telephone equipment to aid the enemy during the war. After Wu was released on bail by him and Xue Jianshu, the cashier of the Sixth Investigation Brigade, Ding and Wu's accountant, Lu Ruqing, went to his house together and gave him a check for 20 million yuan from the City Bank to express their gratitude to him. The court then inquired about the conditions for Wu's bail. Jin said: Ding first contacted Qi directly, and finally decided to pay 455 million yuan, which was not negotiated by him.

Borrowed Tables and Chairs

Next, the first defendant, Yu Shunhua, testified: He did not hold a position in the Sixth Investigation Brigade. Because the Garrison Department held a memorial service for Mr. Dai (referring to Dai Li), he borrowed tables and chairs on behalf of the department and purchased firewood for the team. When he went to the team, he met Chen Zengxiang, whom he did not know, at the door and asked how to report and the benefits of reporting. He replied that he did not know. Later, Chen Wenyi and Zhou Wenda, who handled the case (Chen and Zhou were previously sentenced to five years in prison by the Garrison Department and are now in custody), invited him and four or five others in military uniforms to arrest Wu. As for whether there was a formal arrest warrant for Wu's arrest and where Wu was detained, he did not know anything because he was illiterate. Later, Xue Jianshu sent him 5 million yuan as a reward for borrowing tables and chairs.

Responding with Six Reasons

Finally, Jiang Shilin, Qi's private secretary, replied: He did not have any title in the Investigation Brigade, and only assisted Qi in the capacity of a private secretary. He met Jin and Yu at the team or at Qi's house, but he was not familiar with them. He did not know anything about the case of Wu Baokang's report. Although he knew Xue Jianshu, the cashier of the team, he did not know that he had negotiated to send bribes because of Wu's case. He himself did not receive any bribes. After the confession, he claimed that according to Article 96 of the Criminal Law, he requested to respond with several points to explain that he was not related to Wu's case: (1) He was not an accomplice in Wu's case, and his name was not on the bribery list and check stub. (2) Wu's case was a conspiracy by a certain group of people. (3) After Qi Zaiyu's case occurred, the defendants' confessions did not involve him at all. (4) Qi's confession in the Garrison Department did not say that he had received money. (5) The recovery of bribes had nothing to do with him. He repeated the above-mentioned second point of conspiracy and framed him one by one, and was then stopped by the court. Later, witnesses Wu Baokang (currently detained in the Special Criminal Court), Lu Ruqing, and Xue Jianshu were summoned, but none of them appeared in court. After the lawyers of each defendant debated one after another, the judgment was scheduled to be pronounced at 4:00 p.m. on the 11th of this month. Jiang Shilin was granted bail pending summons, and Jin and Yu were returned to custody.

### Two Defendants in the Zhenfeng Factory Starvation Case Sentenced to Imprisonment

[Our Newspaper] The Special Criminal Court yesterday sentenced a starvation case. This is the first judgment in the court's trial of the labor tide case. The defendants are Wang Kun, the director of the dyeing and finishing department of the Taishi Zhenfeng Woolen Factory, and Wang Yihua, a worker in the factory. The main text of the judgment is: "Wang Kun and Wang Yihua jointly violated the National General Mobilization Order prohibiting obstruction of production and were each sentenced to two years in prison and deprived of civil rights for two years." The facts of the case: Wang was introduced to work in the Zhenfeng Woolen Factory in the 33rd year of the Republic. Wang then introduced Wang Yihua to work in the factory. Wang was active and Wang's personality was also stubborn. Wang ran a reading club in the factory and served as a teacher, so he had a good relationship with the workers. In December last year, a dispute occurred because the workers asked the factory for year-end bonuses. The workers elected Wang and Wang as representatives. The factory did not grant the workers' request, and the workers starved for three days. The factory reported to the police bureau because it suffered heavy losses. Because Wang and Wang were suspected of inciting a labor tide, the police bureau transferred the case to the Special Court for trial after the Special Court was established, and the judgment was made yesterday.

### Trial of the Settlement Fee Interest Case Opens; District Chief and Others Claim to Seek Employee Welfare

[Our Newspaper] Ye Zhenquan, the district chief of Penglai District in this city, Wang Naifeng, the clerk, Zhang Shijun, the district team commander, Yan Shouzi, the cashier, and others previously拆放生息 (a type of Chinese financial activity) 800 million yuan from the collected 900 million yuan of conscript settlement fees in the district, and distributed the resulting interest to the members of the district office in proportion. This was reported by Lu Lijie, an employee of the district office. After investigation, Ye and others admitted, but said, "Other districts also have interest distribution. At the request of colleagues in the office, we distributed it first and reported it to the Civil Affairs Bureau at the same time." The District Attorney's Office filed a public prosecution against Ye and others on suspicion of corruption. The District Court opened the trial yesterday afternoon. Except for Zhang Shijun and Ding Fenghang, who were on the run, Ye and others appeared in court and claimed that this behavior was to seek employee welfare and was definitely not corruption. After summoning witnesses Tian Hong and Wang Zhifu, the judgment was scheduled for the 8th.

### Strange Woman on the Roof of Huashan Road; Police Fired a Shot; Fell to the Ground and Died from Injuries

[Our Newspaper] At about 8:35 p.m. the night before last, someone was found moving on the roof of No. 240 to No. 246 Huashan Road in Shanghai West. After someone ran to report to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, police officer Luo Kaiman of No. 558 climbed the sunbathing platform and saw a dark shadow on the ridge of the roof. He ordered him to get off the roof, but the other party threw tiles and stones. The police officer was afraid that it was a thief, so he fired a shot into the sky as a warning. Unexpectedly, someone immediately fell down, and it was a woman over forty years old who died from a broken jaw. A paper for applying for a national identity card from the 31st District (that is, Gaoqiao District), named Yu Guo Xiuying, was found beside her. Afterwards, Yu Ding, the criminal section chief of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, led the police to investigate. According to He Yuying, a maid in the house, she witnessed the deceased entering from the back door of No. 240 Huashan Road at about 5:00 p.m. Because there were five or six households in the house and she was familiar with the door, she did not suspect anything else and did not question her. At dusk, she heard footsteps on the roof of the neighboring house. According to residents Chen Weixin and others, they heard noises on the roof at about 8:00 p.m., so they went up to the sunbathing platform and saw a dark shadow. They called out but there was no response. When they approached, they threw bricks and stones, so they called the police. Director Yu then detained the police officer. By the next morning, after the District Attorney's Office sent personnel to inspect, it was found that there were no bullet marks, and it was determined that he died from falling injuries. Subsequently, according to the receipt for the identity card application, personnel were sent to the 31st District to investigate. According to the neighbors on the left and right sides of Huashan Road, they did not know him, or he was suffering from mental illness. As for the police officer firing the gun, the examination was in line with the implementation regulations, and there was no improper behavior. He has been released first and is waiting for the superiors to review the case.

### A Conversation with Mr. Chen Gongqia: A New Outline for the Construction of Zhejiang

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Chu Yusheng

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 2nd] Mr. Chen Gongqia has been in charge of Zhejiang Province for three months. In these three months, he has implemented public document reforms, adopted layered responsibility, and public documents do not necessarily have to be approved by the主管 (responsible) officials. He has also abolished armed guards, completely using plainclothes police to guard the gates of the provincial government. He has also set up an inquiry office, staffed by an anonymous staff member to answer questions. In addition, he has replaced and transferred many county magistrates. In these actions, we cannot say that he does not have a new style, but we cannot help but say that he seems too trivial. Because today's Zhejiang is also a microcosm of the country, and there is only one problem, that is, the economic situation needs to be improved urgently. For this reason, the reporter had a long conversation with Mr. Chen Gongqia in his office. He admitted that the current problem is the economy, but improving the economy is easier said than done. "Now he started by sorting out the finances. The past accounts were inevitably a bit vague." He said, "After the finances of Hangzhou City were sorted out, they were much better. The provincial finances must also be sorted out. However, the capital of the Provincial Bank is only 50,000 gold yuan. How can such a bank, which controls the finances of the whole province and circulates the economic blood of the whole province, handle emerging businesses with such a small amount of funds?" According to his intention, the capital of the Provincial Bank should be increased to 5 million yuan.

Spend More Money to Nurture Zhejiang

There are many things he wants to do. He used to be able to issue角分票 (small denomination banknotes) in the Fujian Provincial Bank, which could circulate a lot of funds. Of course, this is impossible now. Therefore, he wants to use the resources of Zhejiang Province, regulate the circulation of resources, and use the trade income from foreign trade to revitalize the industry of Zhejiang Province. For this reason, he has specially established a Materials Utilization Committee. This committee does not belong to the Construction Department, but is directly under the provincial government. It is said that there are no funds, and he has to spend more money to nurture Zhejiang after making ends meet. The first step is to regulate and utilize green ramie, and the second step is to actively improve cotton planting and regulate the more than 2 million mu of cotton fields in Yuyao and the more than 1 million mu of cotton fields in Zhenhai. If the utilization of resources can be successful, then according to Mr. Chen Gongqia, Zhejiang has unlimited prospects.

Planning to Build Two Light Railways

Another plan of Mr. Chen Gongqia is to build light railways and establish a light railway preparatory office. According to him, gasoline will be more expensive in the future, and the parts of cars almost all rely on foreign countries. We can lay light steel rails on the highways, which can recover a lot of foreign exchange for the country and produce more efficiency than automobile transportation. If you think the light railway is not good, you only need to dismantle it, and it is still a good highway." He plans to build two light railways first: one is from Shaoxing Baiguan, from Baiguan to Zhenhai; the other is from Cao'e to Tiantai, Tiantai to Haimen in Linhai. In his view, these two railways increase Zhejiang's two exports, which can sell many local products to the outside, and at the same time, many things from the outside can also be transported in.

Develop Water Conservancy in Oujiang and Lingjiang Rivers

Regarding farmland water conservancy, his idea is that since it is not easy to succeed in Yongli Power Generation in Jiekou for a while, Oujiang and Lingjiang Rivers can also find ways to generate hydropower, which can probably have 10,000 kilowatts. He affirmed: If hydropower generation cannot be used, then the motivating power is lacking, and without the motivating power, there is no way for the countryside to progress. Therefore, in his plan, the water conservancy projects of Oujiang and Lingjiang Rivers must be done, but to do them, a huge amount of funds is required.

Actively Establish Farmers' Schools

He is now going to run a farmers' school. This school does not belong to the Education Department, but is directly under the provincial government. His ideal is to instill new knowledge and technology to farmers. First, set up a farmers' school preparatory committee, and regularly recruit teachers from classes A and B for training. Class A must be graduates from the agricultural college of the university, and class B must be high school graduates who serve in the cultural and educational circles. According to Mr. Chen Gongqia, the ideal of this school is to recruit a group of excellent and young farmers to enroll. After enrollment, they will be given three mu of land and asked to cultivate it according to what the teachers have taught. After graduation, the land will still be cultivated by him, and the harvest will also be at his disposal. In this way, the number of people who enroll will greatly increase, and new agricultural knowledge and technology will also deeply penetrate the countryside. The land policy has also been implemented a lot. He decided that the principal must be a university graduate, and the principal must lead by example and operate like the students.

Use Minerals to Exchange for Materials

In addition, in terms of industry, the alum mines in Pingyang, the copper mines in Qingtian, and the antimony mines in Wuyi, of which copper and antimony are the main raw materials for steelmaking, and alum is an important raw material for all refined steel products. He is now planning to use these many minerals to exchange for what Zhejiang needs.

The reporter asked him if he would go on inspection tours? Do you want to convene the heads of various counties to hold a review and planning of the work? His answer was: "I don't want to go on inspection tours, because even if you repeatedly order the local government not to entertain you, the local government is always prepared, which will inevitably waste money and manpower. For the time being, we will not hold meetings, as long as the agency is flexible, it can be as easy as pointing fingers."

Carefully Observe and Diligently Move Forward

After this conversation, I felt that Mr. Chen Gongqia's outline for the construction of Zhejiang was indeed carved very brilliantly. However, Chinese people often rely on seven parts of personnel affairs and three parts of handling affairs. Just in terms of regulating and utilizing resources, will it affect the interests of some powerful people in the local area? I am afraid that it cannot be completely said that it will not. Then, what method will Mr. Chen Gongqia adopt to deal with this problem when he faces this problem? This seems to be worth asking. We are eagerly hoping that this new outline drawn by Mr. Chen for Zhejiang can be realized as scheduled. We are even more eagerly hoping that Mr. Chen will lead the civil servants of the province, without fear or discouragement, to carefully observe and diligently move towards the goals!

### Stagnation of Fresh Meat Industry in Various Regions: Changshu Butchers Close Doors; Jinshan Raises Fresh Pork Prices

[Our Changshu Correspondent, 3rd] The fresh meat industry here is in complete shutdown due to the discontinuation of hog supply on the 3rd. A petition has been submitted to relevant authorities for relief. It is understood that in previous years, hog vendors procured hogs from Nantong and other places in northern Jiangsu to supply Changshu. However, since the Jiangkou blockade, they have disappeared. Moreover, farmers in the countryside are unwilling to sell hogs at low prices, which is the main reason for the shutdown.

[Our Jinshan Correspondent, 2nd] In recent days, Shanghai hog vendors have been buying live hogs at high prices in Jinshan County. This has led to most breeders being unwilling to comply with the "August 19th" price limit and sell to local butchers, resulting in a lack of meat on the market. In addition to urgently telegraphing the Jiangsu Provincial Government to request the Shanghai Municipal Government to order the pig industry association to purchase live hogs at the August 19th price limit of 26.70 Gold Yuan per dan (unit of weight), the County Government has issued public notices to all townships, forbidding both buyers and sellers from raising market prices, with violators being arrested and punished.

### Disputes Arise During Demobilization: Jiangyin Township Head Slapped

Public Outrage Incites Telegram to Garrison Headquarters for Handling

[Our Jiangyin Correspondent, 3rd] The deadline for the second conscription phase of this year has passed, with only 40% of the new recruits being accepted after inspection. Magistrate Xu has requested punishment for himself. This is due to excessively strict conscription standards.

[Further News] Zhong Jie, the 7th Company Commander of the 3rd Receiving Battalion, assaulted Xu Shouli, the township head of Changyin Township, while inspecting new recruits on the afternoon of the 2nd, leading to a dispute. It is understood that Township Head Xu faced difficulties in conscription, managing to recruit only one person, who was then rejected due to being mentally dull and inarticulate. Xu had a verbal altercation with Company Commander Zhong, resulting in being slapped several times and kicked. This incited outrage among the township heads of demobilized soldiers, who reported the matter to Magistrate Xu and telegraphed the garrison headquarters about the incident, awaiting their handling.

### Guilin Nickel Rush: Wu Guangming Makes a "Currency Reform" Fortune; Supervisor Liao Goes to Central Bank to Investigate

[Our Guilin Correspondent, 29th] The case of Wu Guangming, manager of the Guilin branch of the Central Bank, making a "currency reform" fortune and using his position to profit by hundreds of billions of yuan or more, has caused a sensation throughout Guilin.

Provincial Supervisor Liao Ge-min personally went to the Central Bank on the 28th of last month to investigate, and discovered many suspicious points: (1) The order from the head office to issue nickel coins was received on August 21st, but the Central Bank did not make it public, delaying until August 28th to draft a news release for newspapers. (2) The Central Bank delayed the redemption of nickel coins until September 4th to begin. (3) The Central Bank claimed that "the telegram from the head office did not specify whether the nickel coins to be issued were nickel coins previously issued by the Central Bank, or newly issued copper-nickel coins, so we dared not redeem them without authorization." However, the fact is that from August 21st to 28th, the bank neither announced the circulation of nickel coins nor telegraphed the head office for instructions. (4) On the 23rd, the Central Bank converted 19,000 yuan of nickel coins into Gold Yuan and recorded it in the account. Where did this huge amount of nickel coins come from? Supervisor Liao has now decided to first impeach Wu Guangming for dereliction of duty to the Control Yuan. Liao is actively investigating Wu's abuse of power and embezzlement. After this incident occurred, the Municipal Senate and the District Court paid close attention and were collecting evidence for this case in preparation for filing an indictment.

### Wuxing Holds Rice Sale at Government-Subsidized Prices

[Our Wuxing Correspondent, 2nd] The Special Commissioner ordered the Wuxing County Government to hold a sale of rice at subsidized prices two months ago, but it has not been carried out. Now, the People's Food Adjustment Committee convened a meeting on the 2nd and decided to distribute the remaining 113,200 catties of white rice to 61 townships at an average subsidized price, based on the original cost as the standard. The township heads are required to collect the rice within four days and sell it at subsidized prices immediately to benefit the poor.

[Further News] For this year's land tax, the central government stipulated a levy of one and a loan of one. The provincial government added an additional 1.2 dou (unit of volume) for pacification expenses. All county senators, considering the inability of farmers to bear the burden, jointly elected Speaker Ling to go to the capital with representatives from other county senates to petition for a reduction. Recently, definite information was received that the Executive Yuan disapproved of the levy for pacification expenses. However, the land tax levy of one and a loan of one is currently under negotiation for reduction.

### Turtles Moving: Zhenhai Zhutian Ocean; Sound of Collecting Money Under the Bridge

[Our Yin County Correspondent, 4th by Telegraph] Hu Chaojun from Yin County went to Zhenhai Jiangnan yesterday for business. While passing by the Xin Xin Bridge in Zhutian Ocean, he suddenly heard strange noises under the bridge. Hu, curious, leaned down to look and saw a large group of turtles floating on the water, raising their heads and moving forward with effort. They varied in size, the larger ones being like bowls and the smaller ones like shrimp, mostly black with some yellow. There were countless turtles, occupying about 9 meters in width and 4 meters in depth of the river surface. Wanting to know where they were going, Hu followed them for over half a li (unit of distance), nearing the Zhangjia Bridge near the foot of the mountain. Suddenly, the turtles dived into the riverbed and disappeared. Only then did he realize it was turtles moving house. Farmers in the fields spread the word, causing a stir.

[Our Lanzhou Correspondent, 2nd by Airmail] You Shoufang, the culprit in the shocking bloodshed case in Lanzhou, was given his final trial some days ago, and the verdict was announced at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. There was a large audience in attendance.

This court has decided to impose the death penalty. If you are not satisfied, you may appeal within ten days." The convict You said while being taken back into custody, "Of course I will appeal."

### Changzhou Rape-Murder Case: All Five Culprits Apprehended

[Our Wujin Correspondent, 1st] Yang Xinglin, 40 years old, a fishmonger residing in Jinjia Village, about three or four li from the south of the city, runs the Zhengxie Xing Fish Shop in Chen Du Bridge, a small town in Nanmen. Over the years, he has managed the shop well and is quite wealthy. He has one wife and one concubine, living separately. His wife, Zhou, lives in Jinjia Village in the countryside and cultivates dozens of acres of good land, hiring Ge Shunfu from the same village as a long-term worker. Yang is frequently away from home due to the fish shop, and over time, a relationship developed between the master and servant. At midnight one day at the end of May this year, Ge threw a brick at the roof of Zhou's bedroom. Zhou woke up, got out of bed, lit a lamp, and went out to investigate, when Ge grabbed her and raped her. Recently, Ge asked Zhou to meet him at a hotel near the train station, threatening her to elope with him. Zhou strongly refused, and it did not happen. Ge held a grudge and approached Lin Yueqing, Li Deliang, Li Changfa, and Song Jinyuan from Shangbei Min, offering white rice worth five shi (unit of volume), paying 48 Gold Yuan upfront, and conspiring to murder Zhou's husband, Yang Xinglin. On the night of the 28th of last month, he hid in the Hongbin Hotel on Carpenter Street, Nanmen. At dawn the next morning, Ge directed Li Deliang and others to follow Yang to a remote place in Diba Tou, where they grabbed Yang and stabbed him twelve times in the head and chest with a sharp blade, causing Yang to fall to the ground immediately. Assuming that he was dead, the culprits abandoned the knife and snatched a travel bag left by Yang. Later, Yang was found by a colleague passing by, who rushed him to the hospital for treatment. The local criminal police team received the news and launched an investigation, taking Ge into custody that night for questioning. In less than half a day, the whole case was clear. They used swift and decisive means to apprehend each culprit at their respective addresses one by one. After questioning, they all confessed without hesitation and have now been handed over to the local court for legal proceedings.

### Local Banks, Money Shops and Trust Companies Request Extension of Deadline for Capital Increase; To be Completed Within Three Months After Announcement of Detailed Rules for Capital Increase

[News from Our Agency] Regarding the issue of capital increase for local banks and money shops, since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the regulations and procedures for capital increase, the local banks, money shops and trust companies have listed more than ten articles of the regulations and requested amendments and interpretations. They submitted these to the Financial Management Bureau, which forwarded them to the Ministry of Finance for reference in re-drafting the detailed rules for capital increase. These detailed rules have not yet been promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, and the regulations for capital increase, announced on September 6, originally stipulated that the capital increase should be completed within two months of the announcement. Considering the current situation, the time limit is clearly insufficient. Therefore, the industry association recently jointly submitted a request to the Financial Management Bureau to forward to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the deadline for capital increase be changed to within three months after the announcement of the detailed rules for capital increase.

According to Director Lin of the Financial Management Bureau, as far as he knows, the capital increase regulations only apply to Chinese banks and money shops. Because the situation for foreign merchants is slightly different, it will be handled separately.

### Rice Supply Gradually Decreasing; Both Japonica and Indica Lacking Transactions; Flour Still Suspended from Market, Edible Oil Supply Low

The rice supply is decreasing, and transactions are scarce. A small amount of Jiangxi unpolished Indica rice and Zhonghuo machine-milled late rice are available in the Nanshi market. The former is priced at 17 yuan, and the latter at 18.70 yuan, both for immediate purchase, with approximately 600 dan available. Other Japonica and Indica rice lack transactions. There are few transactions in the Beishi market, and no rice samples are seen in the market, making the situation very bleak. Yesterday's arrivals were 960 dan in Nanshi and 238 dan in Beishi.

Flour

Transactions are still suspended from the market. The market is sluggish, and the number of dealers in the market has decreased. However, factory-allocated flour is still distributed as usual.

Miscellaneous Grains

Transactions are dismal. The supply of soybeans is extremely low. Even if there are samples for sale, they are quickly bought up by the local dealers. Meigong and Poyangzi are both available, but supply cannot meet demand. Corn and Yuanmai are not available. Several dozen packages of red beans were traded at a price of 10 yuan. Green beans and broad beans are not available at all. Sesame transactions are still numerous, making it the only one with normal transactions among miscellaneous grains. There is Nanjing Xinsheng Ren available, priced at 34 yuan.

Edible Oil

In the edible oil market, there was no activity at the beginning of the market, with only cooked vegetable oil available. Later, manufacturers jointly allocated soybean oil and raw vegetable oil, with a limited quota of 5 liang (unit of weight) per household, and a large quantity was distributed. Raw oil prices are stable, but the supply is extremely low. Cooked vegetable oil salt prices have increased by 7 jiao (unit of currency). Small cart sesame oil is available.

### Rice Industry Association Seeks to Expand Grain Sources; Discusses Exchanging Cotton Cloth for Rice

With the rice supply gradually decreasing, Economic Supervisor Zeng ordered Wan Nonglin, the chairman of the Rice Industry Association, to be responsible for expanding the sources of supply. Wan specifically convened representatives of rice merchants and Dong Jiufeng, the chairman of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, at the Rice Industry Association yesterday afternoon to discuss the matter of exchanging cloth for rice. In recent times, farmers in various producing areas have been unwilling to sell their rice because grain prices have not risen. If cloth is exchanged for rice, farmers can be expected to sell their hoarded rice. The two sides exchanged opinions and discussed the matter in detail. According to Dong, the cotton cloth industry has been facing many difficulties recently, and the production of cotton cloth cannot be freely bought and sold. Some of it has been shipped to other ports, and some needs to be allocated to cloth shops. Exchanging cloth for rice may not be possible, so the meeting ended without results.

### Sugar Market Slightly Declines

The sugar market yesterday stopped rising and turned to decline, and the market sentiment was already weak. The trend was slightly flat. Because of the continuous rise in the previous week, retail investors were worried about changes at high levels, and the association authorities also followed the supervisor's instructions to try to suppress prices. Therefore, there were many supplies on the market yesterday, and the interest of various groups was also weak. The market situation slightly declined by two or three jiao.

### Qihong Transactions Not Many

[News from Our Agency] Recently, tea industry insiders told reporters that Qimen black tea, which has always been popular in the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, is a major product, but in recent years, trade with the Soviet Union has been conducted by our government through barter trade. Therefore, at present, exporters in this city only have the United Kingdom as their destination. It is reported that the overseas market is extremely fond of this variety, but the inventory is almost exhausted, and the transactions are extremely narrow, making the situation very good. As for Tunlv and other green teas for export, French North Africa has repeatedly inquired, but holders insist on selling firmly because both production and inventory are scarce, and the process is extremely quiet. As for red and green teas for domestic sales, there are continued additions from this street and various places in Su Xi Chang, and the potential is still active. In terms of prices, they are in balance and not differentiated.

### Treasury Bills Issuance Amount

If the black market interest rate does not fluctuate, the sales volume will not decrease.

### National Cotton Textile Federation Requests Government to Take Charge of Raw Cotton

[News from Our Agency] The National Cotton Textile Federation held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 4:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Director Du Yuesheng. More than 50 directors and supervisors, including Wu Weijing, Wang Qiyu, Liu Jingji, and Pan Yangshan, attended. Important cases were resolved as follows:

(1) Based on the proposal of the cotton spinning associations in the Su Zhe Wan Jing Hu area, requesting the government to take charge of raw cotton, in order to stabilize the price of joint purchase under a comprehensive supply plan and to ensure sufficient supply of domestic cotton, it was agreed to consider the national procurement plan of the competent authorities and the National Cotton Joint Procurement Association, and all factories should abandon self-purchase of domestic cotton. After discussion, all representatives unanimously agreed and requested the Joint Procurement Committee to quickly pass the implementation, and set up joint procurement branches in major domestic cotton producing and distributing centers to facilitate comprehensive purchase.

(2) In addition, the Joint Procurement Committee requested the government to strictly crack down on the adulteration of cotton and the purchase of cotton by people outside the industry. It is hoped that the authorities will issue orders to the governments of all provinces, cities, and counties to strictly implement this. Regarding cotton merchants' flower collection, it is hoped that there will be no large storage quantities. If there is any suspicion of hoarding, it will also be cracked down on. The Textile Federation therefore decided to recommend that the Joint Procurement Committee accept the leaders it dispatched to various places to participate in the joint work. The candidates are: Shi Fengxiang in Xi'an, Pan Yangchu in Chongqing, Li Guowei in Hankou, and Yang Yizhou in Tianjin.

(3) Suggest that the Joint Procurement Committee increase the funding for joint purchase of domestic cotton to match the comprehensive purchase plan

(4) It was decided to convene the third annual meeting of the association on the 8th of next month.

Discussing Distribution Technology Issues

[News from Our Agency] Since the management authorities suspended the transaction of yarn and cloth in the market, the Social Bureau scheduled to convene representatives from the yarn and cloth market, the Yarn and Cloth Industry Association, the Textile Construction Company, the Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District, and the replication industry tomorrow afternoon to hold a meeting to discuss technical issues related to the direct distribution of yarn and cloth. Yesterday, the Textile Construction Company continued to distribute yarn to the replication industry, distributing 601 pieces to 378 households, equivalent to 1,291 pieces of 20-count yarn.

Cotton Yarn Unified Tax Will Not Be Adjusted

After the increase in tobacco tax, the market has been greatly affected. It is generally said that the unified tax on cotton yarn will also be adjusted. According to a responsible person from the Goods Tax Bureau, regarding goods tax revenue, cotton yarn accounts for the largest proportion other than tobacco and alcohol. However, tobacco and alcohol are non-essential items and have luxury components. The government has recently called for frugality and national construction, so it is natural to tax luxury goods. This levy is both prohibitive and can increase government revenue without affecting the welfare of most people. Cotton yarn is a necessity for people's livelihood and is of great importance. The government would rather reduce treasury revenue and does not want to adjust this tax rate.

### Sales Volume of State-Owned Enterprise Stocks on the 2nd

[News from Our Agency] On October 2, the total sales of state-owned enterprise stocks were 26,500 Gold Yuan. The total sales amount to date is 4,018,900 Gold Yuan. The sales amount of each type of stock is listed as follows:

Textile Construction 2,850,500 Yuan

China Merchants 45,500 Yuan

Taiwan Sugar 1,032,200 Yuan

Taiwan Paper 86,700 Yuan

Tianjin Paper 4,000 Yuan

Sluggish Cotton Market

There are still no transactions in the spot cotton market. Since the registration, the inventory in Shanghai is not abundant. Sources from various places have ceased, and the holders are unwilling to sell. The market is sluggish, and there are no prices even for Zhoupu seed flowers.

### Yarn and Cloth Market Stops Trading; Cotton Cloth Association Handles Distribution to Dyeing and Weaving Industry

Yesterday, the yarn and cloth market was ordered to stop trading. Chairman Tang of the industry association met with Supervisor Jiang yesterday to ask about the survival of yarn merchants after the market was closed and the supply and sales of cotton yarn for all members of the association in the future. The staff in the market gathered as usual, waiting for the authorities to decide, without doing any buying and selling.

The Textile Construction Company routinely distributed cotton yarn to manufacturers, listing 40-count three-ply Baoguang at a price of 1,030 yuan, 42-count double-ply Lima Jianxian at 990 yuan, 40-count T.K. Sunlight cone yarn at 1,150 yuan, and 32-count, 20-count, 16-count, 10-count, and 6-count coarse and fine yarns, a total of nine types. The transactions were mediocre.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was also verbally instructed by Supervisor Jiang that in order to coordinate the supply of cotton cloth and prevent repeated purchases, so as to stimulate market prices, the cotton cloth market should immediately stop the market. Therefore, there were no transactions in the market. Only the same industry members were handling the distribution of the dyeing and weaving industry association. In addition, the supply of cotton cloth to retailers and wholesalers is distributed by private yarn factories and the Textile Construction Company, and the allocated prices of each cloth are based on the "August 19" price limit. The first batch of cloth distributed to dyeing and weaving factories includes 62 types such as fine cloth, coarse and fine twill drill, and plain yarn drill, plain cloth white cloth, coarse cloth, etc., totaling 18,530 bolts, and members of the Cotton Cloth Association can take part in the distribution.

Further News: The Cotton Cloth Association will handle the second phase of distribution to the Dyeing and Weaving Association. The distribution procedures and time are as follows: Announce the cloth to be distributed and display samples at 11:00 AM. Collect purchase orders from 1:00 to 3:00 PM. Purchase orders will not be accepted after the deadline. Draw the lots for purchase permission the next day from 1:00 to 2:00 PM. (Purchasers should gather at 1:00). Issue purchase permits from 2:30 to 4:00 PM.

Further News: Yesterday, the business of various door-front cloth shops was thriving, with Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi Yuan drill being the most brilliant. There were some restrictions on purchases, with each person being limited to buying 1.5 zhang (unit of length) with an ID card, or each cloth industry member being limited to buying 1 pi (unit of length) with a membership card. Some cloth shops temporarily supplied, so the market situation was quite uneven.

It is also learned that Chairman Dong of the Cloth Industry Association suggested to the Supervisor's Office that door-front cloth shops should limit each Shanghai citizen to purchase 6 yards (unit of length) with an ID card, and wholesale shops should wholesale to retail shops with membership cards, one piece per shop. Foreign merchants and people will be refused to purchase at all.

### Chamber of Commerce Suggests Guiding Currency Circulation; Ministry of Industry and Commerce Has Approved Separately

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting the adoption of opinions on how to guide the currency obtained from the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency by the people. The Ministry has now approved, stating that the temporary suspension of registration of Chinese and foreign real estate companies is being handled according to the order of the Executive Yuan. The society's separate request to change the restrictions has been submitted to the Ministry, which has been specially submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. As for the request to restore the business of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, it can be left for reference. As for the proposal to issue public bonds to conduct industrial and mining projects, it has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval.

### Rayon Still Popular

The rayon market is still extremely tight, and various types are still in high demand with no supply. The silk weaving industry in this street can be supported because of the allocation. Sales in silk shops are also restricted, and the number allocated by the association is still 100 bales, but applicants are enthusiastic.

### Rising Prices at Production Sites and Impact of War: Export Goods Show Signs of Depletion

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to information from the Export Control Committee, Shanghai's inventory this week (September 27 to October 3) shows signs of depletion due to rising prices of export goods at production sites and the impact of the war in some areas. Approximately 7,000 tons of tung oil arrived in September, mostly purchased privately from the interior. Foreign demand remains strong, with the New York market price still at US$0.21 per pound. Although transactions are possible, trade is not vigorous. According to the United States Information Service, the Economic Cooperation Administration has reportedly approved the purchase of a large quantity of tung oil in China. Hog bristles from Sichuan, Tianjin, and Hankou are still rising in price, leading to scattered transactions. Exports are mostly pre-sold goods. Foreign prices are stable, with Shanghai No. 17 F.O.B. at US$2.45 per pound. Based on current domestic and foreign market prices, transactions are still possible. Foreign demand for tea is quite strong. In addition to the United Kingdom and North Africa, sales in South Africa should not be underestimated. However, the dwindling inventory in foreign tea markets has further caused sellers to hold firm, and trade is becoming increasingly weak. The raw silk market is fluctuating. D-grade silk F.O.B. is priced at US$2.80 per pound, which is exportable, but no business has been conducted yet. Sales of silk fabrics abroad are gradually developing, and market prices are also improving. For example, 45" heavy crepe and 45" "Da Wei Ni" from Sodium America are priced at C.I.F. US$1.50 and US$2.20 per yard, respectively. 27" "Liu Xiang" crepe (interwoven fabric) and 45" crepe satin sold to India are priced at 4 rupees 11 anna and 7 rupees 12 anna per yard C.T.F. in Indian currency, respectively. Goose feathers and duck feathers are also showing promise in the foreign market. Their F.O.B. prices per pound are US$0.50 and US$0.40, respectively, slightly higher than last week. In addition, exports of other items such as sausage casings, soybeans, and sesame seeds are also possible.

The Ministry of Education will soon begin reviewing them in order to approve excellent middle schools and provide subsidies for their development and equipment.

### "Two Cultures in Two Worlds": Hu Shi Speaks on Principles of History and Culture at Wuhan University

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 4th] Hu Shi, President of Peking University, and Li Ji, Director of the Preparatory Office of the Central Museum, gave academic lectures at Wuhan University today. Hu's topic was "Two Cultures in Two Worlds," stating that there is a fundamental principle in history and culture: survival of the fittest, accepting the excellent and discarding the inferior. For thousands of years, there was one world and one cultural tradition. Modern culture can be divided into three categories: (1) science for human happiness, (2) political democratization, and (3) economic socialization, which are accepted by the world. In the past thirty years, some self-proclaimed visionaries have implemented thorough reforms, used their intelligence, and worshiped dictatorship, forcibly dividing the world into two worlds and two cultures, leading to the existence of the Iron Curtain today. However, this is a measure that violates freedom and human nature. Seeing its oppression of the people, cutting off external communication, and feeling empty, it will eventually fail, and mankind will be restored from two cultures in two worlds to one culture in one world, re-accepting political democratization and economic socialization. It is also learned that another task of Hu's trip is to collect reference materials related to the Water Classic Commentary left by the sages Yang Shoujing and Xiong Huizhen of Hubei Province, in order to help him complete the textual research of the Water Classic Commentary.

The review of various issues such as funding, assets, teaching, and guidance will continue today.

### Qing Shu Scholarship Adds Twelve New Awards

The Qing Shu Scholarship, formerly the Shu En Student Loan managed by the Xinwen Daily during the Anti-Japanese War, has benefited no fewer than 400 university students, and more than 80 students have completed their university studies with the help of the scholarship. It is recently learned that the alumni of the school, together with the alumni of the Qing Shu School of Linghu in Shanghai, are willing to donate a portion of their monthly income to the scholarship in order to uphold the founder Zhang Rongchu's educational aid purpose and to establish new awards to promote the role of the scholarship. A total of twelve new awards will be added each semester. The Qing Shu Scholarship Committee will ask twelve schools, including Jiaotong, Jinan, Fudan, Shanghai Medical, Shanghai Commercial, Guanghua, Soochow, Datong, Hujiang, Daxia, St. John's, Zhendan, and Nantong, to recommend one second-year student from designated departments. The students must be from poor families, have excellent character and academics, be physically healthy, and have an average grade of 80 or above for both semesters.

### Expenses for Settling Refugee Students from Beiping and Tianjin Have Reached One Trillion Legal Tender; Counselor of the Ministry of Education in Beiping Talks About Northeast Colleges Starting Classes in Order

[Report from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 4th] Liu Qiunan, Counselor of the Ministry of Education in Beiping, said: The problem of schooling for refugee students from Beiping and Tianjin has been largely resolved. The Ministry of Education has spent one trillion legal tender for this purpose. Northeastern University will start classes on the 11th, and Changbai Teachers College will start classes on the 4th. If the Shenyang Medical College can find suitable school buildings in western Taiwan, the Ministry of Education has no objection to its relocation to Taiwan. Changchun University can also start classes as soon as it finds a school building in Tianjin. The cram schools for college and middle school students who failed the entrance exams can also start classes in Tianjin before the 20th of this month. The First Temporary Middle School has moved into the Yellow Temple, and there is no problem with starting classes in the near future. The Third Temporary Middle School will move to Tianjin within a week, and the Shuhe Temporary Middle School is starting classes on site at the Nianhua Temple. The only problem is the Shanxi Temporary Middle School, as a school site has not yet been found. In addition, the Executive Yuan and the Northeast Suppression Headquarters will each allocate funds soon to prepare cotton clothing for students.

### Overseas Students Complain: Difficult to Obtain Support Due to Increased Foreign Exchange Controls

[United States Information Service, New York, 4th] The Voice of America will broadcast tomorrow (Tuesday) Chinese students Song Xiyuan and Zhu Shilin talking about the economic difficulties of Chinese students in the United States. It is said that the Chinese government has strengthened foreign exchange controls, and the economic difficulties of overseas students have therefore increased. Even overseas students who have huge sums of money in China are currently unable to obtain support. Due to the strict restrictions, many are unable to pay for their living expenses and tuition. Some Chinese students are able to barely cope because they can work in nearby stores, but it is quite difficult to find a job due to competition, and they must do so without hindering their studies, so there are many difficulties.

### Taiwan Provincial Games to Be Held in Tainan on December 7; Budget of Over 70 Million Taiwan Dollars Approved

### Jingwu Cup Volleyball: Semifinals Today

St. John's and Jingwu Compete for Final Spot

The Victory Cup Volleyball Tournament organized by the Jingwu Athletic Association has entered the final stage. The atmosphere has been tense in the association's gymnasium on Sichuan Road in recent days. Yesterday, both matches were played as best-of-five. In the first match, the Tiemajun (Iron Horse Army) lost the qualifying match. The Tiemajun had more balanced personnel, and their skills and experience were better than the Xiangjun, so they won the qualifying match three to one. In the second match, Yongyi beat Watson's to win the championship match. Yongyi is the champion of Jingwu Cup Group B, and Watson's had previously followed closely behind with very close scores. Last night's battle was truly a clash of titans. Yongyi was aided by Ma Canxi and Guo Linjian, which was like adding wings to a tiger. Watson's lost again by three to zero. Yongyi won the final match. The results are recorded below:

Tiemajun 13-21 21-12 21-16 21-18 Xiangjun

Yongyi 21-15 23-21 21-18 Watson's

Starting at 6:00 PM today, the championship match between St. John's and Jingwu will still be held in the association's gymnasium on Hengbang Bridge. Another match will be a qualifying match. The order is as follows:

Zhenhua vs. Fanxing 6:00 PM

St. John's vs. Jingwu 7:00 PM

In the second match of the championship, St. John's will face Jingwu. Jingwu defeated Mobil in the semi-finals, proving that the team is at its peak. Qi Yongfu and Li Zhen'an serve as the backbone of the first and second rows. Li is known for his powerful attacks and strategic play. The Chen brothers are skilled at high spikes. Weng Chengguang's dropshots and Qian Jiaxiang's quick attacks from St. John's are fatal blows to Jingwu. However, if St. John's wants to win the championship match, they must fight hard with all their strength, so the competition will be fierce.

In the first qualifying match, Zhenhua usually plays with seven players. In the match against Jixian three days ago, the seven players were full of vitality, making Jixian at a loss. Captain Xu Mouliang performed brilliantly. It is often said that Zhenhua playing with seven players can beat nine players, but it is unclear why. Winning against Fanxing today is expected. The order today must not be changed. Please pay attention to the four teams.

### Yinyin Cup Table Tennis Tournament: Three Matches Today

The organizers hope that the winning teams will submit the record sheets to the association the next day, and the captains or staff of both teams must sign the sheets for verification, otherwise they will be invalid. In the Qian group match the day before yesterday, Zhexing has always been the iron army of the banking world. In this match, they defeated Tongshang by 13 to 4, living up to their reputation as the runner-up in the previous tournament. In another match, Yizhong defeated Zhongnongnong in a fierce battle. The former's Zhu Renyong fought bravely, winning five games alone and laying the foundation for the team's victory. Zhongnongnong was unable to catch up and lost by 10 to 13. The results of the day before yesterday and today's schedule are recorded below:

### On Chinese Cuisine

— Rong Zhi

Of all the manifestations of Chinese culture, one that is truly a source of pride and universally acknowledged is probably the art of cooking. Everyone says this, but upon closer reflection, even cooking is showing a trend toward decline; at the very least, it requires effort to maintain this reputation.

Chinese cuisine possesses a consistent artistic and philosophical significance, historically aligned with poetry, calligraphy, painting, landscape, and gardens, all mutually interconnected. The most crucial principle is that each dish or set of dishes must maintain its unique character, just like writing poetry. If a poem is half in the style of the Han and Wei dynasties and half in the style of the late Tang dynasty, or if it could be attributed to either person A or person B, then it is not a remarkable poem worth passing down or enjoying.

In recent times, the schools and styles of cooking are generally divided into Huaiyang, Shandong, Fujian, Guangdong, and Sichuan. This is not to say that there are no other good cuisines, but these are the readily discernible sectarian distinctions, universally acknowledged, just as the Four Wangs differ from Shi Xi and Shi Tao, with completely different appearances, impossible to forcibly equate. In major cities, you can experience whichever cuisine you prefer by visiting the corresponding restaurant. Before about 1931, famous restaurants mostly maintained their traditional styles. Some highly conservative establishments even only offered a few fixed dishes, making you feel that they were perfectly executed. In the last dozen years or so, the atmosphere has gradually changed. Every restaurant strives to imitate, resulting in a uniform taste across all establishments, even to the point where there is little distinction in the flavor of each dish. This is a great blow to the advantages of Chinese cuisine. For example, before 1921, walnut cream was only available in private Guangdong homes, and its preparation was more refined than later versions; its sweetness came from jujube broth rather than added sugar. In the decade that followed, it became available in every restaurant and consumed at every meal. The Chinese people's lack of critical thinking, blindly following the crowd, is truly innate. Every time I see the image of Wu Liang Shrine carvings used as a pattern on new book covers, all the same, I feel the same lament. There are many other patterns from Han paintings that could be used; is the tile-end design not good, or is the mirror inscription not good? No matter what it is, when it becomes so widespread, it will never be good.

The sense of taste requires variety the most. The excessive variety of Western cuisine is its weakness, but its combinations also have the beauty of complementing each other, such as cooked and raw, crisp and soft, rich and light, dry and wet, as long as they are not too biased toward one aspect. The ancients said, "Using water to dilute water, who can eat it?" If one cannot gather the strengths of all, innovate, and make the most of each, how can it be considered good cuisine? All artistic works must avoid rigidity and decay. To achieve this, one must first seek truth. The fundamental goodness of Chinese cuisine lies in preserving the original true flavor to the greatest extent possible. Some believe that ingredients like cabbage, bamboo shoots, and tofu have no flavor of their own, but this is not the case. It is not necessarily that sweet and salty are the only true flavors; bland is also a flavor. However, these ingredients are highly neutral, and when combined with other things, they can produce endless new flavors. These neutral ingredients are indispensable to good Chinese cuisine.

Every dish must have its main part. No matter how complex the ingredients, this main aspect must not be lost. For example, just as articles have a subject and a predicate, and prescriptions have a principal, assistant, adjuvant, and guide, once these are mixed up, the meaning becomes different. There must be distinctions in quantity, order, or preparation method.

The ancients said, "A large broth will not be exquisite." The highest realm of cooking is the absence of vulgar flavors, just as the greatest joy is not in pleasing the ear, and the most beautiful color is not in pleasing the eye. The Chinese artistic philosophy calls it "transcending the visible, returning from extreme splendor to simplicity." This principle is consistent. The popular three-word formula for chefs is "boil, soften, dilute." Although exaggerated, it reveals a profound truth. In short, the fewer seasonings used, the better. Especially recently, things like monosodium glutamate should only be used as a last resort, for quick fixes. If it is used frequently, thinking it can enhance the umami flavor, it is like adding another red carpet on top of a perfect carpet, not only useless but also harmful.

Cuisine is not only for eating, but also for seeing and smelling. The harmony of colors, the arrangement of forms, the management of positions, and the embellishment of the environment are all important. Generally, the shapes of animals are inevitably crude, so one should try to avoid exposing them. As for the natural colors and shapes of vegetables and fruits, they all have their own special advantages. Westerners pay great attention to this. Some say that Western cuisine is for looking at. Indeed, looking at it makes one feel refreshed, and the appetite naturally increases. This is the natural development of humanity's six senses, allowing one to enjoy the beautiful meaning of life. The emphasis on color, aroma, and taste in Chinese cuisine is for this very reason. Many vegetables should retain their original beautiful forms (such as celery, rapeseed sprouts, and carrots), preserve their green pigment, and fully utilize their nutritional value in cooking techniques. This is the right way. Many people still do not understand the importance of green pigment and cover the pot even after it is cooked. They do not realize that after being stir-fried in boiling oil, it is already thoroughly cooked, so there is no need to cook it further. Except for salt, there is no need to add any seasoning to preserve its raw and crisp deliciousness. This kind of cooking is often difficult to achieve in restaurants, but housewives should be aware of it. Chinese people do not pay much attention to eating raw vegetables, which is a major shortcoming. They can only resort to cold dishes to make up for it. Pickled vegetables in winter are simple, economical, and easy to eat. They do not lose their natural essence and are much more nutritious than pickled mustard tuber and Chinese turnip. Du Fu's poem says, "Crisp raw vegetables add beauty." Su Dongpo ate cold turnip after drinking. This is still the way it is eaten in the North. They mix pickled cabbage with ice in cold weather. Eating noodles must be mixed with raw scallions, raw radish, raw bean sprouts, and cilantro. They also eat corn and millet as their staple food, and the distribution of their diet is more reasonable, so their health seems to be stronger than that of southerners.

Lao Tzu said, "Governing a large country is like cooking a small fish." This is a saying that people who are particular about cooking quote with pride. How should this be explained? I think the art of cooking is connected to politics. It lies in everyone being content with their place and making the most of their abilities. Almost no ingredient is unusable in cooking. Those who are good at using them can turn the rotten into the magical, never letting anyone feel left out. Once used, they must be able to fully express their unique advantages. That's all. Skill advances to the level of Tao. This is what it means.

### Jade Tower Spring

— Chen Meng'an

A sakura song written for Qin Yanchong, inscribed by his younger brother Yanruo.

### Painted Fan Surface

The misty sea merges with the breath of flowers, languidly leaning on the east wind, charmingly awakening. Unsentimental, full of regret, with shallow and deep reds, cutting off the root of the past, transplanting it with new tears. A sorrowful spring, already resigned to being haggard, quietly appreciating the distant, precious clusters, supporting its long-lasting intoxication. Let the butterfly messengers and bee matchmakers have their way, look at its delicate and charming form. A guest used a rhyming poem to request a descriptive piece for the season, so I wrote this interpretation.

### Butterfly Loves Flowers

A guest used a rhyming poem to request a descriptive piece for the season, so I wrote this interpretation.

Now I believe the tide has its promise. Evening after evening, morning after morning, rain after rain, wind after wind in gusts. Sorrow shallow, sorrow deep, sorrow also exhausted, in the heart, things in the heart, asking the heart. Indulging in wine, indulging in flowers, lingering in every corner. One regret is longing, one regret is longing with hatred. Saying that lately people are not close, line after line of pearly tears, line after line of powder.

### Suggestion

— Fei Yu

"Suggestibility," also known as "suggestion receptivity" in psychology, is the most basic principle of hypnotism. We often accept other people's suggestions without even realizing it. Now I'm going to ask you readers a question: "In English, is it correct to say that six plus seven (is) fourteen, or is it correct to say that six plus seven (are) fourteen?" Some of you will think that (is) is correct, and some will think that (are) is correct, without realizing that six plus seven is not fourteen at all. This is because when I asked the question, I suggested to you that one of the two sentences above is correct, and the only difference between the two sentences is that one uses (is) and the other uses (are). So you accepted my suggestion and focused on these two words.

Now I'm going to ask you to calculate a problem. You can only look at the problem once, and you have to calculate it very quickly. The problem is:

"A train with fifteen passengers departs from the starting point. At the next stop, three people get on and seven people get off. At the next stop, six people get on and five people get off. At the next stop, eight people get on and ten people get off. At the next stop, nine people get on and two people get off. At the next stop, five people get on and eleven people get off. At the next stop, seven people get on and three people get off. How many stops has the train made now?"

If you really want to calculate quickly, I believe you will have to go back and count again to answer me. In fact, how many people get on and off at each stop is completely irrelevant to the answer I want. I deliberately said the unnecessary number of people, so readers only counted the number of people and ignored the stops.

Children's suggestibility is simply astonishing. Someone conducted several experiments to test the suggestibility of thirty elementary school children, and the results were extremely interesting. He first had a French teacher led into the classroom to introduce him to the children, and then the teacher left, and he began to ask questions. He first asked them what color the French teacher's beard was. As a result, eleven children said it was brown, eight said it was gray, five said it was white, two said it was red, and only four were correct, they said he had no beard. Then he asked them whether the teacher was holding his hat in his left hand or his right hand when he came in to speak. As a result, seventeen said he was holding it in his left hand, eleven said he was holding it in his right hand, and the remaining two were smart, they said he was not holding a hat in his hand. But in fact, the teacher's hat was always properly worn on his head!

In court, suggestibility is often cleverly used to uncover the truth of a case. A mechanic requested alimony from the railway company where he worked, because his arm could not move after a train accident. The company's lawyer sympathetically asked him how high he could lift his left arm now. He painfully raised it only about an inch. The lawyer then asked if his left arm was completely healthy before the accident, and he replied that it was. So the lawyer said very politely:

"Now let me see how high you could lift your left arm before the accident."

The plaintiff inadvertently lifted his left arm over his head, which caused the whole court to burst into laughter, and the truth was revealed.

### Strange Laws in America

— Yang Lu

Lighting a fire under a donkey's belly is illegal in Texas.

Dancing "face to face" is prohibited in Campden.

In Seattle, it is illegal to open the lid of someone's garbage can placed in front of their house without the permission of the homeowner or the municipal authorities.

In Nebraska, it is illegal for a shop selling beer if the shopkeeper does not put the beer-making pot outside. (Quite a reward)

### Yu Dafu's Age and Other Matters

— Lu Danlin

Last Thursday, I went to Suzhou for business, and in the Kaixuan train carriage, I was reading Chen Congzhou's "Yu Dafu's Year of Birth" in this publication. The reason why I wrote that Dafu was 54 years old in 1945 was because Dafu himself wrote it in his will. This error, perhaps Dafu intentionally added a few years to his age, just like his exaggeration about having more than five million volumes of books in his Hangzhou residence and saying he had been in business for eight years.

Coincidentally, when I finished reading Chen Congzhou's article, Dafu's eldest son, Yu Fei, was also on the same train to Suzhou, sitting in the seat next to me. (He had come to my house on Wednesday evening to chat and also said that he would go to Suzhou the next morning.) I asked him about his late father's age. He said: I don't remember exactly how old he would be this year, but I only remember that he was born in the year of Bing Shen, which seems to be 52 years old. So, what Chen Congzhou heard seems to be correct. In my article, I just copied his will as it was, and at the time I did not refer to other materials to explain it for him, which should be stated.

Regarding the recent situation of Dafu's several sons, I think that people who care about Dafu's orphans would like to know a general overview. The eldest son, Fei, is currently studying at a university in Shanghai and will graduate in more than a year. He currently lives on Emei Road. He studies political science, and although he likes literature, he only considers it a "side business." In recent years, he has also been very careful to collect writings and anecdotes about Dafu that have been published in various publications.

Regarding the issue of Dafu's complete works, according to his will, he wrote more than ten kinds of works, and no royalties have been received for more than ten years. However, it is said that Dafu gave nine books to the Beixin Bookstore for publication during his lifetime. And the rights to these nine books are not in the names of his three sons. Therefore, Dafu's statement in his will that "if someone negotiates with the Shanghai Beixin Bookstore on behalf of the publishing house, then the three sons who are in the country can get tens of thousands of yuan" is not based on any documentary evidence, and the bookstore said that Dafu's advance royalties are still overdrawn. Thus, the assertion that no royalties have been received for more than ten years and that tens of thousands of yuan can be obtained by negotiating with the bookstore are indeed conflicting. During this period, the copyright for the compilation of Dafu's complete works has become a problem, and the sales of the book are also in doubt. Therefore, no one has started editing it for three years, and there is a reason for this.

Dafu's second son, Yun, is currently in Fuyang, and his third son, Jun, is currently in Fujian, both of whom are attending school. The three brothers are in different places, working hard at their studies, which is reassuring to the literary friends who care about Dafu's orphans. I will add a few words in passing.

### A Record of Xu Zijin

— Qian Dacheng

Xu Zijin was a dealer in antiques during the Tongzhi and Guangxu reigns of the late Qing Dynasty. However, he was famous throughout the country, and Grand Historian Jiang Jianxia published his book "A Dream Record Before the Threshold." Scholars who study editions have repeatedly praised his book. Although Zijin's book only records stationery, inkstones, calligraphy, famous paintings, and books, which the sages called minor skills, they are all true insights and have something worth seeing.

Zijin's name was Kang, and his alias was Cuan Sou. He was from Wujun. He resided at the Old Mountain Building of the Zhao family in my hometown for a long time, helping Zhao Feixi, Esq., distinguish the antiques in his collection. Wu Kutie once said: "Zijin is an expert in connoisseurship. He can distinguish the authenticity of bronzes, calligraphy, and paintings as soon as they come into his hands. He is like Song Shangqiu today." Kutie's standards were higher than the top of his head, and he did not lightly praise people. His words like this show Zijin's learning.

This spring, I bought a handwritten copy of Zijin's "Pine Heart Notes" at the Qinchuan Bookstore in Suzhou, with three seals: "Xu Kang," "Xike," and "Shangchi Xian Guan," as well as two long postscripts by Zijin. The book was handwritten by Zijin's nephew, Ziyu. The notes are medical cases written by Old Man Miao Songxin of Wumen. Songxin was the son of Wenzi, and his family served as officials for generations, with spare time for medical arts. Zijin's postscript says: "The above are all the old man's newly made prescriptions, with refined thinking and wonderful principles, finally achieving success. Today's doctors are all unskilled, studying for less than a day and seeking quick results, eagerly hanging up their medicine bags to make a living. They are at a loss when they hear of difficulties, and they cannot distinguish between the real and the false. I once said that the scholar-officials of ancient times were all versed in medical theory, and even specialized experts must have deep learning, whether hidden or apparent, but sufficient to be immortal. Today's scholar-officials despise it as a lowly art, and those who practice medicine are all frivolous young men, with little money to study and insufficient strength to do business, so they learn medicine out of boredom and try it out casually..." Zijin was well-versed in medical theory, so his words were so poignant.

Zijin's son, Hanqing, was able to inherit his learning. He once forged a "General Who Conquered Liao" seal to deceive Wu Xianzhong, the governor. After obtaining this seal, the governor renewed his old ambition to ask for the mission to face the disaster of the Japanese pirates, and ultimately failed. This was the fault of a bookish armchair strategist. The novel "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" uses "Yu Hanqing" as a veiled reference to Hanqing's name. Kezhai was an expert in ancient appraisal, but he was deceived by Hanqing; then Hanqing's family learning was indeed enough. It is a pity that he did not follow the right path, and he was only known for his skill in forgery. Zijin's learning, on the other hand, was original, with exhaustive knowledge and wide hearing, and he would not disdain to do such a thing. However, today's antique dealers lack even this skill of forgery.
