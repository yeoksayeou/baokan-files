### China and Britain Exchange Compensation Demands in the Kowloon City and Shamian Incidents; London Attempts to Shift the Focus of Negotiations

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Regarding the Sino-British negotiations, there seems to be another twist on the 21st. After receiving instructions from London, the British Embassy, in the name of Ambassador Stevenson, delivered a written note to our Foreign Minister Wang this morning. The note was not in the form of a protest, but made quite specific demands regarding the Shamian incident in Guangzhou: The Chinese government should be responsible for the Shamian incident; thoroughly investigate the cause of the incident; severely punish the perpetrators; provide generous compensation to the British residents who suffered losses; and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs remained silent after receiving the note. A reply may be issued within days, informing the British side that the note has been received, but a specific response may not be presented in the short term. Regarding the Kowloon City issue, there was no progress on the 21st. The Ministry hopes to receive a reply from the British side within the week. It is understood that the British side's measures on the 21st seem to be an attempt to shift the focus of negotiations to the Shamian incident. Our side still believes that the Kowloon City and Shamian incidents are causally related, and the Kowloon City issue should be resolved as soon as possible based on the two principles of not abandoning our country's jurisdiction and restoring the freedom of the arrested people, and that the injured people receive compensation.

[Reuters, London, 20th] Minister of State McNeil, when answering questions from members of parliament in the House of Commons on the 20th, mentioned the Guangzhou incident and anti-British demonstrations throughout China.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 21st] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a note to the British Embassy on the night of the 21st, demanding compensation for all the losses of the Chinese whose houses were demolished in Kowloon. The British Embassy has forwarded the note to London, and a response should be received soon. It is noted that the British originally regarded the Guangzhou incident and the Kowloon incident as two separate incidents. However, the note submitted by the Chinese government tonight indicates that it will regard the two as the same incident. Furthermore, it is also the first time that the Chinese government has raised the issue of compensation.

[United Press, Nanjing, 21st] Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated at a press conference on the 21st that the Chinese government will handle the recent losses of British property in Guangzhou in accordance with the general principles of international law. The Kowloon City incident involves fundamental jurisdictional issues. The National Government was forced to make demands regarding the status of Kowloon City and the arrest or injury of residents by the Hong Kong police based on jurisdictional grounds, and as a result of Hong Kong's illegal firing in Kowloon City.

### Measures for Private Enterprises to Apply for Government Guarantees for Foreign Loans are Established

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Regarding private enterprises applying for government guarantees for foreign loans, there is still a lack of review standards and supervision methods, which need to be uniformly stipulated. The Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Economy, Transportation, and the Central Bank have met to discuss and agree that if a private enterprise applies for a government guarantee for a foreign loan, if the enterprise cannot repay the debt, the government must fulfill its guarantee responsibility. Therefore, this guarantee is tantamount to increasing the government's debt. However, China's industrial and enterprises are still in their infancy, and borrowing foreign capital is essential. In order to support private enterprises, it is necessary to guarantee their foreign loans. Therefore, the principles of review standards and supervision methods were discussed and determined. After being approved by the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Central Bank and other agencies jointly drafted the "Measures for Private Enterprises to Apply for Government Guarantees for Foreign Loans," which were approved by the Executive Yuan for implementation. The original text is as follows:

Article 1: Private enterprises applying for government guarantees for foreign loans shall apply in accordance with the provisions of these measures. Article 2: Private enterprises applying for government shall meet the following conditions and apply to the competent authority:  Articles of Association of the enterprise organization and registration date,  Balance sheet and profit and loss statement for the most recent three years,  Draft loan agreement,  Use of loan and repayment method.  Whether the product is exported and estimated foreign exchange income,  National Bank guarantee deposit. Article 3: The competent authority, when it deems it necessary to apply for the above-mentioned guaranteed loan, shall send the original documents to the Ministry of Finance for review. After the review is in compliance, it shall be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Ministry of Finance shall then transfer it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to notify the foreign government to approve the guarantee, or the Ministry of Finance shall directly guarantee it to the foreign bank. Article 4: After the loan contract is signed, the private enterprise shall separately copy and submit it to the competent authority of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank for reference. Article 5: The review of private enterprises applying for government guarantees for foreign loans shall be in line with the national industrial policy, and the priority order is as follows: (A) The loan is used to purchase export materials and equipment, and the product can be exchanged for foreign exchange; (B) The loan is used to purchase master machines to manufacture production tools, which can indirectly save foreign exchange expenditures; (C) The loan is used to purchase domestic necessary production equipment. Article 6: The loan repayment period shall be proportional to the loan amount, and the shortest shall not be less than five years. Article 7: Private enterprises with government-guaranteed loans shall deposit all foreign exchange earned from the sale of their products in the guaranteeing bank for the payment of principal and interest due on the loan. Article 8: Before the loan is repaid, the private enterprises shall submit their annual final accounts to the competent authority of the Ministry of Finance, and may send personnel to audit the business situation.

### This Year's Cotton Purchase Reduced to Three Million Dan; Detailed Rules for Cotton Yarn Cloth Control Being Reviewed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The plan originally formulated by the Cotton Yarn Cloth Management Committee to purchase cotton was to purchase 5 million dan. Now, due to the lack of cotton sources, this year it will be reduced to 3 million dan. Calculated at the current market price, each dan of cotton is 5.6 million yuan. Purchasing 3 million dan of cotton requires 16.8 trillion yuan. After Yuan Liang discussed with Zhang Jia'ao, it is heard that Zhang has agreed to invest 10 trillion yuan in loans from the Central Bank. In addition to the 2 trillion yuan that has been allocated first, the rest will be allocated successively. All these loans are guaranteed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The Ministry of Economic Affairs started reviewing the detailed rules for the implementation of the cotton yarn cloth control measures on the 20th. The detailed rules for the implementation of the unified purchase of cotton have been passed on the 20th. On the 21st, the review will continue to revise the detailed rules for the implementation of cotton yarn spinning and the detailed rules for the implementation of cotton cloth weaving. There are still three parts, including the detailed rules for the distribution of cotton cloth, which are scheduled to be reviewed at a continued meeting on the 22nd, and are expected to be completed on the 22nd. The review meeting on the 21st was still presided over by Liu Siying. Regarding the spinning part, several points have been revised: The profit for spinning work used to be calculated on the basis of 259 and a half pounds of cotton (20 counts of raw materials), and the legal currency was paid according to the price approved by the Management Committee. Now it is changed to be paid according to the market price converted into legal currency. Simplify the procedures. The original implementation rules stipulated that yarn merchants should first exchange the cotton yarn warehouse receipt for the cotton allocation certificate, and then exchange the cotton allocation certificate for the cotton warehouse receipt. The cotton allocation certificate has been canceled during the review on the 21st, reducing one layer of procedures. In addition, it is learned that regarding the part of the resident factory specialists in the implementation rules, after careful consideration by the relevant authorities, it is believed that there are more than 600 yarn factories in the country. If two resident factory specialists are sent to each factory, more than 1,000 people will be needed, which is worthy of consideration in terms of economy and technology. Therefore, the authorities are still reconsidering.

### After Japan Abolished the "Four-Party Policy Agreement"

January this year has become a political season for Japan. This month, there are two conferences that have a significant impact on the Japanese political situation, regarding the success or failure of the Katayama Cabinet. One is the third plenary session of the Socialist Party held on the 16th, and the other is the second Diet convened on the 21st. The Socialist Party is the largest party in Japan, and its chairman, Katayama, is the current Prime Minister. Since the party's victory in the election last April, it has been plagued by internal divisions between the left and right wings, as well as attacks from the Liberal Party led by Yoshida and the Democratic Party led by Shidehara. This has led to the Katayama Cabinet's indecisiveness in implementing policies. General public opinion and polls have predicted that the Katayama Cabinet will have difficulty surviving the January crisis, and that the party congress will undergo major changes in personnel and policies, and may even trap Katayama in a dilemma. On the 19th, the party congress overturned the "Four-Party Policy Agreement," which served as the basis for Katayama's joint government plan, by a margin of 21 votes. Domestic and foreign commentators believe this is a fatal blow to the Katayama Cabinet. The Democratic Party and the Liberal Party believe this is a major event for the Socialist Party, and the direction of the Katayama Cabinet is worthy of attention. Undoubtedly, this major event is a change in the Socialist Party's policy, which will affect the progress of the second Diet. But what is the truth of this event? Will the Katayama Cabinet retreat immediately? It is worth paying attention to.

The Japanese Socialist Party is a political party representing the working masses, and its mass base is built on the majority of workers and peasants. The party adheres to socialism and firmly upholds the principles of democracy and freedom. Since Japan surrendered, its organization has expanded, and its strength is strong. Last year, the new constitution was implemented, and a general election was held nationwide. The party defeated the far-left Communist Party, the right-wing Liberal Party, and the center-leaning-right Democratic Party, the Cooperative Party, and other parties, winning 408 seats in local councils (prefectures), 48 seats in the House of Councillors of the central parliament, and 143 seats in the House of Representatives, rising to become the largest party in Japan. According to the new party regulations, the Prime Minister must be elected by the majority party, so the party chairman, Katayama Tetsuo, took office as the "commoner Prime Minister" of the new constitutional government with the support of a majority of votes in the House of Representatives, and is still in office for less than a year. At that time, Katayama's appearance was due to the support of the entire Socialist Party, as well as the support of the Ashida faction of the Democratic Party and the Cooperative Party. Now, the Katayama Cabinet is centered on the Socialist, Democratic, and Cooperative parties.

According to Katayama's ambition at the time, the government implementing the new constitution should be a coalition government without the Communist Party. Therefore, before the personnel arrangement, he made many efforts to win the cooperation of Yoshida Shigeru of the Liberal Party, and did not hesitate to make the greatest concessions on the policies announced by the Socialist Party before the election, and the four-party common policy drafted after the election results were announced. On May 16, the so-called "Four-Party Policy Agreement" was established, which is divided into the following nine items: 1. In order to break through the economic crisis, a comprehensive plan may be drawn up to implement state management, taking into account the current economic organization when necessary; 2. In order to increase production, adopt a super-priority industrial policy, and implement state management of important basic industries when necessary. However, its management should abolish the bureaucratic control method and implement it in a democratic manner; 3. Industrial revitalization must be carried out with the active cooperation of entrepreneurs and workers; 4. In order to overcome inflation, adopt sound financial measures and implement financial control when necessary; 5. The government will increase the special burden on those who become rich by taking advantage of inflation or black market transactions. However, the plan to freeze new yen deposits or stop interest payments on national bonds will be abolished; 6. Place wages and prices under strict control, and implement a strict rationing system for the scarce parts of daily necessities, ensure the supply of fertilizers and agricultural tools and other necessities for rural areas to increase food production, and improve the purchase system as soon as possible to fully obtain the purchase quota; 7. In order to rebuild industry and stabilize people's livelihood, thoroughly eliminate black market transactions and fully improve sea and land transportation capacity; 8. In view of the fact that overcoming the crisis is more difficult than the awakening of the national consciousness of national salvation, special attention should be paid to promoting the elevation of national morality and the renovation of culture and education. These nine policies are mostly biased towards the economic aspect, and their focus is on the nationalization of important industries, financial control, wage and price control, and the protection of the working masses, and the crackdown and exclusion of the bullies. However, the item of not agreeing to freeze new yen deposits or stop interest payments on national bonds is intended to protect the wealth of a few vested interests, which is a compromise with conservative forces. This economic policy is neither completely socialist nor free capitalist. It can be called a reform of modified socialism, or a revision of capitalism. Yoshida of the Liberal Party and Shidehara of the Democratic Party did not have much opinion on the content of the "Four-Party Policy Agreement." What they insisted on was the arrangement of personnel. As a result, the agreement was established, but the Liberal Party and Shidehara did not participate in the coalition government, but this agreement has always been the route followed by the Katayama Cabinet.

This time, the Socialist Party congress overturned the "Four-Party Policy Agreement," indicating the strength of the party's left-wing forces, posing a new threat to Katayama and Suehiro Nishio. The Socialist Party has always been divided into left and right wings, and the right wing has both radical and gradual factions. "Nichino" is in the hands of the left-wing Kanjyu Kato, while the leadership of "Zennou" is in the hands of Rizo Hirano. Hirano is a radical of the right wing, and was the former Minister of Agriculture of the Katayama Cabinet. He was dismissed due to discord with the Cabinet Secretary General Nishio. Hirano then called on the backbone of "Zennou" and a small number of factions of the Cooperative Party to create a new Kanro Party movement, intending to divide the Socialist Party; recently, he launched 16 members of the House of Representatives of the Socialist Party to withdraw from the party, hoping to dismantle the first party's position in the House of Representatives, which once set off serious political waves. Katayama Nishio took emergency measures and rectified Hirano on the eve of the Socialist Party congress, and notified the House of Representatives to inform Hirano to resign voluntarily before the 21st. This time, the Hirano issue and the merger issue of "Nichino" and "Zennou" were listed as the main issues. It may be the rising anti-Nishio movement within the party, and the decision to abolish the "Four-Party Policy Agreement" shows that the majority of the party gave Nishio a major revolt victory. The development of this event will inevitably cause difficulties for the Katayama Cabinet.

However, this does not immediately mean that the Katayama Cabinet is on the verge of collapse. First, the "Four-Party Policy Agreement" is a policy agreement of the coalition government, not a complete party agreement. The Katayama Cabinet does not need to insist on this agreement, and may even re-establish a three-party policy agreement that lives up to its name. In fact, Katayama and Ashida are studying new policies to cope with the Allied peace conference with Japan. Last year's "Four-Party Policy Agreement" has long lost its effect in terms of the situation; second, in this Socialist Party congress, the left wing won in policy decisions, but in personnel changes, the right wing made a comeback and still won the leadership of the party, which shows that the left wing's attempt has been shattered. According to the results of the party's election on the evening of the 19th, in addition to Katayama being re-elected as the chairman, right-wing candidate Inajiro Asanuma defeated left-wing candidate Kanjyu Kato and was elected as the party's secretary-general, and centrist candidate Satoshi Nakazaki defeated left-wing candidate Matsuzuki Tanaka and was elected as the treasurer, presiding over the party's finance and accounting. In short, the right-wing personnel's holding of the leadership is a powerful explanation of the strength of the Socialist Party's right wing, and Katayama has overcome a difficulty in this crisis. In the future, the changes in the Japanese political situation within January will depend on the development of the second Diet.

How will Katayama cope with the undercurrents of the new Diet? He may propose new policies to win the support of the Diet. If the Diet supports the new policies, the government can stabilize. If it fails, he may dissolve the Diet and hold new general elections to let public opinion decide the fate of the government.

### The Brutal Killing of Foreign Missionaries Exposes the True Face of the Communist Bandits; Dong Xianguang Talks at a Press Conference

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Director Dong Xianguang said at a press conference on the 21st:

The case of the Hubei bandit army's wandering troops brutally killing three Lutheran foreign missionaries has fully revealed the illegal and chaotic situation in the Communist area, and can show that the Communists have abandoned their disguise and exposed their true face, attempting to intimidate the good people into engaging in rebellion by burning, killing, torturing, and slaughtering, and harming religious personnel. The existence of this terrible situation was previously obscured by the Communists' subtle propaganda, and foreign countries did not know much about it, but the truth of the facts has now been exposed, and modern civilization in the Communist area is feared to be completely bankrupt. Today, the number of men, women, and children who have escaped from areas under the pressure of the Communist army is no less than 500,000. These refugees have traveled around and lived a hard life, and many have fled to major cities, seeking refuge, causing the cities to be filled with internal refugees, forming the world's most serious relief problem today. The majority of these refugees are from poor families, and their lives are completely dependent on government relief. This not only increases the government's burden, but also worsens into a huge social problem. Today, concerning the people, all have the right to be elected, but this supplementary method of party nomination restricts party members from participating in the election on their own. I wonder how the party committee will interpret this order?

(Answer) The supplementary method of party nomination stipulates that party members must be nominated by the party to be candidates, which is to protect the right to be elected of ordinary citizens, and is the common practice in European and American democratic countries, and does not conflict with our country's constitution.

(Question) Can you tell us the reason why the government withdrew some personnel from Shenyang?

(Answer) At present, only the families of the technical personnel of the National Resources Commission in the Shenyang area are being evacuated. After some important industrial and mining areas in the Northeast fell into the hands of the bandits or were destroyed, most of the technical personnel have been dismissed. At the same time, factories in other areas of the country are in urgent need of these talents, so the relevant authorities have decided to transfer the above-mentioned personnel to work in other areas when needed.

(Question) Has the Central Propaganda Department instructed the party newspapers on the editorial position to be taken on the Kowloon Incident? If so, what is its nature?

(Answer) This question seems to be for the Central Propaganda Department.

### The Completion of the Liangjiadu Bridge Will Allow the Zhegan Road to Be Unobstructed

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 21st] The Liangjiadu Bridge is more than 500 meters long and is the first large bridge on the Zhegan Road between Hangzhou and Nanchang, except for the Qiantang River Bridge. It will be completed within days, and Hangzhou and Nanchang can be directly connected. Director Hou Jiayuan said that the Hangzhou-Nanchang traffic on the road is imminent and will leave for Shangrao and Nanchang on the 22nd to inspect.

The self-produced coal from the Kengkou Coal Mine is less than 100 tons. There is still a shortage of more than 1,000 tons per month. Purchasing from various mines in Jiangxi Province is difficult due to transportation and economic issues. Currently, there is no coal in stock on the road. If the allocated coal or purchased coal is not continued, there will be a danger of stopping the train. In addition, the road project is progressing very quickly, the route is increasing, and Hangzhou and Nanchang are about to be connected, but the lack of vehicles on the road is a major problem.

### Loss of Duty Case of Yu Ying-chieh, Director of the Examination Department of the Import Control Commission, Decided Not to be Subject to Disciplinary Action by the Disciplinary Committee for Public Officials

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The case of Yu Ying-chieh, Director of the Examination Department for Non-Quota Imports of the Provisional Import Control Commission, who was accused of dereliction of duty, was referred by the Control Yuan to the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee for disciplinary action. It has now been resolved that Yu Ying-chieh will not be subject to disciplinary action. The reason given is that the original accusation concerned the Zhonghe Paper Mill's application to purchase paper-making machines and printing presses, all of which were urgently needed industrial products. The Fund Department had already approved their purchase abroad, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had issued passports for travel to the United States to place orders. Yu Ying-chieh, as the Director of the Examination Department for Non-Quota Imports of the Provisional Import Control Commission, delayed approving foreign exchange, thereby delaying production, which was deemed a dereliction of duty. However, according to the defense: "Upon investigation, the Zhonghe Paper Mill's application to import paper-making and printing machinery involved a total of US$300,9903.75, which was considered a substantial amount. The responsible department submitted the original case to the Advisory Committee of the Commission for a decision, with a signed note stating, 'Experts should be consulted for review first, and the factory's performance last year should be investigated before a decision is made.' It was noted that 'the factory's expansion is still needed, but the paper-making machine to be ordered is found to be second-hand, and its production capacity is not as high as estimated. Furthermore, the factory's power supply is insufficient and needs to be supplemented by the Shanghai Electric Power Company.' Previously, Mr. Qu Lang, Consultant to the Executive Yuan, conducted a detailed investigation and research on the domestic paper-making industry and submitted a proposal stating, 'The existing equipment in paper mills throughout China is not being fully utilized. At present, priority should be given to supplementing parts and raw materials to promote resumption of work and increased production. As for applications for equipment expansion, they should be deferred due to limited foreign exchange reserves.' Consultant Qu Lang held the same opinion on the Zhonghe case. Subsequently, the matter was submitted to the 37th Executive Committee of the Commission for review and discussion. The committee members unanimously agreed with the opinions provided by various experts and rejected the case. The Provisional Management Department then notified the company of the rejection based on the resolution. The company resubmitted a petition on August 16 of this year, stating its reasons and requesting reconsideration. The matter was again reviewed at the 6th Business Meeting on October 6, which upheld the original decision to reject the case." Since the case had already undergone extensive consultation with experts and had been reviewed and approved for rejection by both the Executive Committee and the Business Meeting of the Commission, the responsible person in charge of the department could not change the decision.

However, it is reported that Vice President Wang Yunwu of the Executive Yuan does not agree with increasing staff salaries, so the matter has not yet been resolved.

### Ministry of National Defense News Bureau Releases Weekly War Situation Perspective: No Large-Scale Contact on Any Battlefield

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released a weekly perspective on the war situation from January 15th to 21st on the 21st. The full text is as follows:

The overall war situation this week was slightly calmer than last week. This is because the Communist troops across the board have been battered by the National Army and are undergoing reorganization and replenishment in the Northeast. In North China, they are under pressure from the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters and have no choice but to rely on the cover of the Taihang Mountains and the newly dug tunnels and rat holes. Apart from occasional sneak attacks and guerrilla warfare, the main force is also dormant. In particular, the Communist troops under Liu Bocheng, Chen Yi, and Chen Geng in Central China have been dispersed everywhere to avoid decisive battles with the main force. In southern Shanxi, the Communist troops, with a force of more than 40,000 men, could not even hold on to the Zhongtiao Mountains, which they claimed as their base area, and fled north in droves. The remnants of Liu Bocheng's troops, consisting of the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th Columns, are also scattered and fleeing in the Dabie Mountains. Therefore, apart from the National Army's mopping-up operations, there has been no large-scale contact on any battlefield this week.

However, this temporary calm will not last long. This is precisely what the Communist leader Mao Zedong instructed the Communist troops to do: "Preserve strength," "Avoid strength and attack weakness," and "Obtain rest." But he does not know that the National Army will not allow the Communists to breathe.

Based on the statistics of the war results we have obtained from all parties since the beginning of the new year, according to incomplete reports, from the end of December to the middle of this month, the Northeast has crushed the Communist troops of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 10th Columns in the areas on both sides of the Liao River and southern Liaoning, and they can no longer act rashly.

In North China, more than 4,100 people were killed, wounded, or surrendered from the end of December to the middle of this month. In the Central China battlefield, the statistics for one month show that more than 31,000 Communist troops were killed or wounded, and more than 4,200 surrendered and were captured (the results of the battles in western and eastern Henan have not yet been included). It can be imagined that the Communist troops' fleeing tactics still cannot avoid significant sacrifices. Now, in order to boost the morale that has been declining, they are again cheering up the Communist troops' cadres in various units, shouting the slogans of "Preparing for a counter-offensive," "Preserving existing bases," and "Expanding enlistment," intending to continue their last-ditch struggle.

In the aforementioned search and pursuit operations of the National Army, the local militias in western Henan heroically demonstrated the valiant achievements of "Protecting the homeland" and "Fighting traitors and bandits." In Deng County, more than 4,000 local militias resisted the attack of two columns of the Communist Geng's troops, plus the remnants of the 10th Column under Liu Bocheng, totaling more than 24,000 men, for as long as twelve days. On the 16th of this month, they joined forces with the National Army and local militias who came to their aid and safely retreated to Mengjialou and other places northwest of Deng County. The Communist troops' call to "Eliminate the local militias" did not achieve its goal, but they lost as many as 6,000 men in the attack on Deng County. This proves to what extent the Chinese peasants' mood of struggle against the Communist bandits has reached.

Summarizing the overall bandit suppression military affairs of the past week, we can see that the war situation of bandit suppression has gradually entered a new stage.

### First Meeting of the Four Powers After the Foreign Ministers' Conference, Inauguration of the Berlin Allied Control Council, Soviet Representative Accuses the Merger of British and American Zones of Violating the Agreement, U.S. Side Demands Reform of the German Currency System

[Reuters Berlin, 20th] The Berlin Four-Power Allied Control Council held its first meeting here today after the failure of the Four-Power London Foreign Ministers' Conference. According to reliable sources, the U.S. delegation presented the Frankfurt agreement on the new economic and administrative measures for the British-American merged zone during the meeting. The Soviet delegation immediately read a prepared statement, pointing out that the agreement violated the Potsdam Agreement and demanded its abolition, but did not indicate that this demand was an ultimatum. At the end of the plenary session, U.S. Army General Clay requested a restrictive meeting with each delegation attending with a maximum of four people. This meeting lasted only ten minutes, during which General Clay raised the demand for implementing a German currency reform. Today's meeting was chaired by British Army Lieutenant General Robertson, and the atmosphere was sincere. Allied delegation officials all stated afterward that the meeting was no different from previous meetings. French Army General Koenig, due to other business, excused himself before the end of the meeting and was replaced by his deputy. At the beginning of the meeting, General Clay first reported on the general situation of the Frankfurt Agreement and stated that the meeting held in Frankfurt only involved economic issues and was unrelated to politics. He promised that he would soon submit the detailed content of the agreement to the Allied Control Council.

### U.S. Army Commander-in-Chief Flies to Washington After the Meeting

After Clay's statement, Soviet Army Marshal Sokolovsky stood up and first thanked Clay for his report, and then took a long two-page typed statement to express the Soviet Union's views on the agreement, saying that the Soviet delegation believed that the Frankfurt agreement was a further step toward dividing Germany and establishing a West German state, completely ignoring the institutions of the Allied Control Council during the process, which violated the Potsdam Agreement. He also pointed out that the British-American zone agreement did not have the support or participation of German democratic elements, or even the participation of non-democratic German elements, such as German Social Democratic leader Schumacher, Soviet zone Christian Democratic leader Kaiser (who was recently dismissed by the Soviet authorities), and British zone Christian Democratic leader Adenauer (in fact, none of these three participated in the Frankfurt meeting). Finally, he said that the Soviet Union's demand was to stop the implementation of the British-American merged zone plan, which violated the Potsdam Agreement and the Allied Control Council agreement. Sokolovsky spoke for ten minutes, with a calm and courteous attitude. At this point, General Koenig excused himself and left, and after thanking General Clay for his report, he promised to convey it to the French government. British Army Lieutenant General Robertson then stated that General Clay's statement was made on behalf of the United Kingdom and the United States, and said that the Frankfurt Declaration was divided into two parts, one was a general statement, and the other was the content of the new suggestions announced by Clay, both of which were joint statements of the British-American merged zone. General Clay finally stood up again to declare that the new suggestions of the merged zone did not violate the Potsdam Agreement, and promised to submit the details of the merged zone resolution to the Allied Control Council soon.

[Reuters Berlin, 20th] U.S. Army General Clay, after attending the meeting of the Four-Power Allied Control Council for only twenty minutes, hurriedly boarded a special plane from Berlin to Washington.

### Soviet Army Commander Has Denied Saying That the United Kingdom and the United States Should Withdraw From Berlin, Soviet Union Will Launch an Offensive Against the British and American Zones

[Central News Agency Berlin, 20th, United Press] When the Soviet Army Commander explained how the Soviet policy would suddenly change at the important meeting of the Allied Control Council, he denied the newspaper's claim that the Soviet Union would demand that the Western Allies withdraw from Berlin.

[Reuters Berlin, 21st] Sources here believe that after the Soviet Union protested the new resolution of the British-American merged zone at the Allied Control Council meeting yesterday, the Soviet press will continue to launch a strong offensive against the "West German state."

At the same time, the "German People's Congress" led by the Socialist Unity Party will also launch propaganda for "unifying Germany." If the Soviet Union's demand to stop the implementation of the new resolution of the British-American merged zone encounters the resolute refusal of the United Kingdom and the United States, the Soviet Union may consider taking measures such as implementing currency reform in East Germany and demanding that the Western Allies withdraw from Berlin. However, these measures will be taken only when the Soviet Union feels that the situation has deteriorated to an irreparable point. The "German People's Congress" will demand a nationwide referendum in the general assembly in March this year to decide on the unification of Germany. According to people close to the Socialist Unity Party, a more moderate action that Marshal Sokolovsky could take would be to delay time. Although the Soviet Union has not issued an ultimatum, it has made specific and definite demands. It is expected that Marshal Sokolovsky will reiterate his demands at future Allied Control Council meetings and indicate that the Soviet Union may be willing to compromise if the decisions of the British-American merged zone can be revised. If the United Kingdom and the United States still refuse, the Soviet Union will not hesitate to announce its counter-measures.

### German Labor Strikes Spreading

[United Press Nuremberg, 21st] 20,000 German workers in the American-occupied area of the Ruhr began a strike on the 21st to protest the shortage of food. More than 100,000 workers in Cologne in the Rhineland also responded to the hunger strike. 30,000 metallurgical workers in Nuremberg began a half-day strike from noon on the 21st. According to union leaders, workers throughout the city, except for transportation workers, will participate. Nuremberg has a population of 400,000. Because the government refused to accept the Bavarian union's seven-point food collection plan, at least 30,000 strikers will hold demonstrations.

[Reuters Cologne, 21st] 100,000 workers in Cologne will hold a 24-hour strike today to protest the lack of food. The number of strikers in various parts of the British-occupied area of Germany will now reach at least 110,000. Cologne's postal, telecommunications, railway, and gas workers will not participate in the strike, but tram workers have been on strike for 36 hours. Construction workers in Wences County are also striking due to lack of food. The number of strikers in Wiesbaden has reached 9,000. Tram workers in Dortmund are already on strike. It is expected that the strike of 100,000 factory workers in Cologne will trigger labor strikes throughout the Ruhr region.

### Italy and France Will Establish a Customs Union Agreement

[Reuters Paris, 20th] Well-informed sources say the French government will issue a statement in the near future announcing its support for the establishment of a customs union between France and Italy. The French and Italian governments will announce the establishment of a joint committee to gradually implement the customs union plan. This plan was first proposed by Foreign Minister Sforza at the Paris Sixteen-Nation Conference.

### French Government Forbids Activities of Soviet Groups

[Reuters Paris, 20th] A spokesman for the French Interior Ministry said that the government has ordered the banning of the "French Patriotic Soviet Citizens Association" and its organ, "Soviet Patriots." The agency was established privately without police permission and is an illegal organization that can no longer publish publications. About a month ago, a Yugoslav patriotic group in France was also banned from activities by the French authorities.

### If the U.S. Is Unwilling to Aid Western Europe, the Soviet Union Will Sweep Across Europe, Dulles Advocates a Western Hemisphere Joint Defense

[Reuters Washington, 20th] Republican foreign policy advisor Dulles attended the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 20th to present his views on the European Recovery Program. He said: The free countries of Europe, after suffering serious wounds caused by the war, are gradually recovering, and the Soviet leaders are using various methods other than war to make it a fatal wound. Unless the United States helps these free countries to recover their health, it is feared that the Soviet leaders' plan will eventually succeed.

The goal of the Marshall Plan is not only to help others out of trouble, but also to safeguard the interests of the United States itself. The Soviet leaders believe that the free system in Europe is in a precarious state, and a slight push can push it into the abyss. The Communist Party is sitting on the sidelines, ready to provide this blow. The political disunity in Europe has caused economic turmoil. If the Western European countries, including Germany, can have organizations such as customs unions and currency unions, coupled with the aid materials provided by the United States, the current state of poverty can be transformed into a state of well-being. At the same time, the Western European countries must also have appropriate political unity to make them a solid front sufficient to cope with any emergency. Therefore, the Western European countries should establish a regional convention similar to the Western Hemisphere Joint Defense Treaty within the framework of the United Nations. Western European unity is one of the main points of the Marshall Plan and the reason why the Soviet leaders criticize it. The Soviet leaders know that a divided Western Europe and a desperate economic situation can make its people accept the Soviet Union's will. On the contrary, 250 million united Western European people can never be conquered by any force. Dulles then mentioned the West German issue and demanded a clear definition of the role of West Germany in the European Recovery Program. He pointed out that the Soviet Union already has a certain plan to determine the relationship between Poland and East Germany, waiting for the approval of the peace conference. Therefore, the people of East Germany and Poland have great confidence in the future and can carry out their economic plans. As far as France, the Netherlands, Belgium and other countries are concerned, their pre-war economies were closely linked to Germany, so they should know the future state of the Ruhr and other regions.

### Anglo-American-French Meeting to Be Held Next Week; Discussions on West German Administration; French Representative Fully Agrees

[Reuters, London, 21st] Well-informed sources say that discussions among the three powers of Britain, America, and France on the administration of West Germany will be held in London next week. France has expressed its agreement to hold these negotiations. French Ambassador Massigli will bring the formal consent of the French government when he returns to London from Paris today. Discussions between the British government and the United States on holding this meeting have not yet been completed. Britain believes that it would be very useful to discuss the administrative plans for the Anglo-American merged zone, especially the six-point plan to expand the authority of the German Economic Council in the merged zone.

### American Government in Germany Should Be Under the Command of the State Department

The American occupation government in Germany, regarding the supply for the European Recovery Program, is above any other European country. To facilitate the execution of this task, the American occupation government should quickly be placed under the command of the State Department. Marshall cannot jointly formulate West German economic policy with Bevin and Bidault on an equal basis during the period of military control in West Germany, so this situation should be quickly rectified. Dulles finally said: the United States does not want to assist Europe if it falls under foreign dictatorship, and the Soviet Union is about to sweep across Europe. At that time, the cost of military equipment needed by the United States, compared with the expenditure of the Marshall Plan, would be no more than "a bag of peanuts."

### Second Japanese Diet Opens; Emperor Hirohito's Address More Humble Than Before; Prime Minister Katayama to Deliver Policy Speech Today

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st] The second session of the new Japanese Diet opened on the 21st. The Emperor attended and delivered an opening address, acknowledging the Diet as Japan's highest authority and calling on all members of the Diet and the Japanese people to strive for the world's trust.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] This morning, the opening ceremony of the Japanese Diet was held, and communist members attended. Since its establishment, the Japanese Communist Party has refused to attend the opening ceremony, considering it shameful that when the Emperor enters the parliament to read the imperial rescript, all members of the Diet must bow to him. The imperial rescript issued by the Emperor at this morning's opening ceremony was much more humble in its wording than in the past. The previously common term "subjects" has been changed to "both sovereigns."

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] After the resumption of the second Japanese Diet, the Japanese House of Representatives and the House of Councillors will hold a formal meeting at 3:00 PM on the 22nd, at which time Prime Minister Katayama will deliver a policy speech, followed by questions from members of various parties. The first item on the agenda is the new budget issue.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st] Japanese Education Minister Katayama told the Associated Press on the 21st that the government's policy is not left-leaning. Although many problems are very difficult, he has decided to continue in power and has no intention of resigning.

### Japanese Senate Vice-President Refuses Emperor's Audience

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 21st] Japanese Senate Vice-President, Socialist Party left-wing leader Matsuki, today "refused the Emperor's audience after the opening of the Second Diet." This responsibility is an unprecedented action in Japanese history. Matsumoto said that he opposed the "audience". Since the Emperor was invited to attend the opening ceremony of the Diet, the speakers of both houses should welcome the emperor. Now instead of showing respect, it is absurd.

### Allied Control Council for Japan Meeting Lasts Thirty-Eight Seconds

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] The Allied Council for Japan held a meeting on the morning of the 21st and did not discuss international affairs. It lasted only thirty-eight seconds before adjourning.

### American Military Advisors Go to Greece to Participate in the War

[Associated Press, Athens, 20th] American military officers flew to the northern front line of Greece on the 19th to participate in the Greek army's operations against the guerrilla team led by General Markos.

### A Major Secret in German Archives: The Soviet Union Once Negotiated with Germany; Considering Joining the Tripartite Axis Alliance

[Reported by This Newspaper] New York, 21st Broadcast: Washington News, The U.S. State Department released the first volume of secret documents obtained from the German archives, which mentioned that the Soviet Union negotiated with Germany to discuss the possibility of the Soviet Union joining the German-Japanese-Italian axis. At that time, the Soviet Union insisted that the area south of Baku and Batumi should be within the scope of Soviet expansion.

### United Nations to Send International Troops to the Holy Land to Maintain Order; British Troops Decide to Withdraw Before August

[Social Success Lake, 20th] It is heard that the United Nations Palestine Partition Committee reached a general understanding on the 20th that after the British troops withdraw this summer and the United Nations implements partition, international troops will be sent to the Holy Land to maintain order. It is heard that this decision was reached as the United Nations Security Council prepared to convene a meeting to deal with another threat to peace in the world.

[Associated Press, London, 21st] An official gazette announced today that British troops will accelerate their withdrawal from Palestine and will not delay. Two-thirds of the British military supplies in the area have also been moved out for sale.

Colonial Secretary Listowel announced in the House of Commons on behalf of the government that British troops would not remain in Palestine after August 1st. On the contrary, the withdrawal date may be advanced, and there is no reason why the withdrawal cannot be completed before August 1st. Members of all parties cheered.

### Student Riots in Iraqi Capital Oppose Treaty Between the UK and Iraq

[United Press, Iraqi Capital, 20th] More than 6,000 students here rioted violently for six hours today in opposition to the revised alliance treaty between Iraq and the United Kingdom. As a result of the conflict, eight people died and 140 were injured. The police fired at the rioting crowds and arrested hundreds of people before order was restored.

### Kravchenko May Become an American Citizen

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th, Associated Press] A bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and sent to the Senate may make it possible for Kravchenko, the former chairman of the Soviet Union, to become a U.S. citizen.

### Truman Reports to Congress on the Amount of Gold in Various Countries; Soviet Gold Reserves Exceed US$2.5 Billion

[United Press, Washington, 20th] President Truman reported to Congress today that the amount of gold held by the Soviet Union is second only to the United States and greater than that of any other country. As of June 30 last year, the United States had gold bars worth $22,789,000,000, the rest of the world had a total of $14,000,000,000, and the Soviet Union had a total of $2,500,000,000, plus $50,000,000 held in the United States. Next was Britain, with gold worth $2,360,000,000, and then Switzerland, with gold worth $1,350,000,000. The sixteen Western European countries aided by the Marshall Plan had a total of $13,659,000,000 in gold and U.S. dollars.

### After the Revival of the Communist International: Where is France Going? November 12th Air Mail from Paris; Special Correspondent Mao Shu

The news of the Warsaw Nine-Nation Conference spread throughout Europe. The first country to react with the most tension was France. This was not only because the "bigwig" of the French Communist Party, Duclos, went all the way to Warsaw to attend, but it was actually a powerful factor in attacking the current French regime. After the end of World War II, France's domestic politics were a multi-party coalition. Initially, the Communist Party participated in the cabinet. Later, although the Communist Party was excluded from the cabinet, it still possessed a strong force in the French National Assembly (i.e., the original House of Representatives). In diplomacy, France was not only a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union, but almost the "only" bridge. In the international conference hall, Molotov's arrogant demeanor seemed to show a bit of "deference" only to Bidault. Recently, former U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes's magnum opus "Speaking Frankly" has been published daily in the "Paris edition" of the Avant-Garde Tribune, and there are several passages that talk about the old events of the Yalta Conference. Stalin and Molotov's contempt for France at that time has surprised many French readers today.

Frankly speaking, from Hitler's surrender to the present stage, France's diplomacy should be considered the most successful. France is still suffering from inflation, and the wars in the colonies are still nowhere near the end. The restoration of industry and agriculture is not only not keeping up with Britain, but is also much worse than Belgium and the Netherlands. Looking at France's national economy and people's livelihood on the streets of Paris, it is almost pitch black. However, Bidault sits in the international conference hall, and no one dares not to believe that he is one of the five great powers. Since the end of the war, the most international conferences have been held in Paris. In any international conference, the United States and the Soviet Union have turned against each other, and most of them have ended with Bidault's compromise proposal. If we use Chinese characters to express this meaning, it can be called "fence-sitting diplomacy" or "bridge diplomacy."

The attitude of diplomacy more or less reflects the structure of domestic politics. I said in a communication in April of this year that since General de Gaulle left the French Presidential Palace, there has been an actual leader in the political shell of France, and this person is called Léon Blum. I also said: "In the period when liberalism and totalitarianism, capitalism and communism, have not completely broken down, but also cannot be completely integrated, Léon Blum is an inevitable product. Although there is only one Léon Blum in the world, there are countless incarnations of Léon Blum..." I have met Léon several times in Paris, and he repeatedly said that he was a "true Marxist," but he was definitely not a communist, especially not a communist related to Moscow.

Léon Blum is the top leader of the French Socialist Party. From his fallout with de Gaulle to the present, France has always been the world of the Socialist Party. Not only France, but the situation in the whole of Europe for the past two years has been that the Socialist Party has been making noise in the east and west. The ruling party in Britain, although nominally "Labour," is actually the most authentic Socialist Party. This summer, the various organizations of the European Socialist Party held a meeting in the capital of Belgium, which many people called "the reappearance of the ghost of the Second International," although they did not use the name of the "Second International." But in fact, for the past two years, the entire European situation, which has been using bridge politics between the two great powers of the United States and the Soviet Union, has been the masterpiece of the Second International.

The Warsaw Conference of the Nine Communist Parties directly attacked the so-called ghost of the Second International. The Warsaw Communist Manifesto clearly criticized Léon Blum, Attlee, Bevin, and the current French Prime Minister Ramadier, saying that they stole the good name of socialism and were "accomplices" of capitalism. Not long after the Warsaw Conference, I went from Poland to France and listened to Léon Blum's speech in the city of Angoulême. The seventy-year-old politician blushed and scolded the Communist Party. He directly analyzed the current world's two major groups, the current situation and the future. He especially criticized the French Communist Party for listening to Moscow in everything.

That speech was given at a medal awarding ceremony for members of the Socialist Party. Léon Blum especially emphasized the unity within the Socialist Party. He said that some party members, because they could not resist the sweet words of the Communist Party, and at the same time because their understanding of true socialism was not enough, "have recently appeared very shaken." A French colleague secretly told me: that refers to Mollet. Mollet is now the leader of the left wing of the French Socialist Party and is an opponent of Ramadier. In the left-right struggle of the Socialist Party, Ramadier formed the cabinet, while Mollet took the post of Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Socialist Party.

No one told me the inside story of Mollet's cooperation with the Communist Party. Generally speaking, when the actions of the Communist Party are moving towards extremism, the Socialist Party has only two paths to take: one path is to "cooperate" with the Communist Party, even to the point of selling its soul to him. The left-wing leader of the Polish Socialist Party, the thirty-five-year-old bald young man Cyrankiewicz, is like this. During my stay in Warsaw, I saw Cyrankiewicz "fully" "cooperating" with the Communists, and at the same time I saw him using all means to "purge" the Socialist Party internally. As far as the so-called left wing of the Socialist Party is concerned, this path is not impassable, because socialism and communism are only separated by a wall. Although the old theories of the "Second International" thirty years ago still had a small effect in using the "US-Soviet bridge" in the past two years, the so-called international combination of the Socialist Party is still empty. American diplomacy under Vandenberg and Connally will not nakedly talk about socialism, but Moscow's strengthening of the use of the International Communist Party is never perfunctory in the slightest.

However, Mollet did not choose this path. After all, the situation in France today, and the factors of geography and history, have not yet reached the state of Poland. When I arrived in Paris, it was the eve of the general election of cities and towns, and the Communist Party's masterpiece "Labour Movement" expanded to all workers of the subway. According to Parisians, the subway strike was the first time in thirty years. When this transportation artery is cut off, no matter how beautiful Paris is, it will become like death. Prime Minister Ramadier mobilized all military vehicles and private trucks to help maintain transportation. The streets were crowded with vehicles. It took twenty or thirty minutes to wait for a taxi to cross a bridge. The army was dispatched all over the city, and the police were sweating profusely, unable to maintain that ugly traffic rule. The Communist Party was secretly laughing every day: "See how many days this Socialist cabinet can last?"

Those few days, the scene was indeed lively enough. De Gaulle, who made a comeback, was cheered "Long live!" by the crowds in the torrential rain in Algiers! A few days earlier, de Gaulle gave a speech at the Vincennes racetrack in Paris, scolding the Communists, cursing the spoils-system "democracy," and criticizing the current constitution of the Fourth Republic. The general idea was exactly the same as his founding declaration of the "Rally of the French People" in Strasbourg. One point was very new: in Strasbourg, he rarely talked about foreign countries, but this time in his speech at the Vincennes racetrack in Paris, he praised the United States and President Truman.

What interested me were the scattered materials after the speech. De Gaulle's own newspaper said that there were 700,000 listeners, while the Communist Party's "Humanité" said that there were about 50,000 listeners. The French people's lack of a sense of numbers surprised me! One army newspaper said that there were 500,000 listeners, while the police report said that there were 150,000 participants. According to the police spokesman, they calculated based on the seats in the racetrack, so it was more accurate!

It was at that time that Bidault returned from the United States! Paris's "Humanité" wrote in large headlines: "Bidault returns empty-handed!" On another day, the Communist Party's "Humanité" called Bidault "Truman's errand boy." What was especially humorous was that next to their report of Bidault returning empty-handed, they wrote in conspicuous large characters: "The Soviet Union's 1.5 million tons of wheat are waiting to be shipped to France!"

Bidault always had that "slow" and "unhurried" look. At the airport, he said: "The Marshall Aid Plan is a manifestation of the political wisdom of the United States, it is the generosity and assistance of the United States, it is the cornerstone of creating lasting peace for mankind after this war defeated the common enemy of mankind, therefore, I firmly believe that the Marshall Aid Plan will be realized!"

At the winter sports arena in Paris, at the campaign speech of the MRP (Popular Republican Movement), Bidault told many humorous stories that made people laugh until their stomachs hurt. He said: "The Communists say that I returned from the United States empty-handed, but may I ask, which one has returned from another country with both hands full?" He said: Today, France's right to exist has not been denied. "From the White House to Broadway Road in New York, none of the Americans I have contacted does not sympathize with and help us, France." Bidault also called on the Communist Party not to look at France with the eyes of Russians, but to look at France with the state of mind of French people. He believes that France has gained more support and will definitely be able to obtain American wheat, coal, and industrial raw materials this winter. "As for the detailed negotiations, diplomacy should be kept confidential, so please forgive me for not being able to reveal them here!" The crowd applauded him warmly.

The Popular Republican Movement was singing a "duet" that day. After Bidault's speech, Deputy Prime Minister dared to scold de Gaulle for a long time, saying that the Communist Party's terrorism and the "Rally of the French People's" nonsense were both enemies of the French people. He said: "De Gaulle is indeed great, therefore, in his mind, only he himself is great!" The audience burst out laughing!

However, the election ended, and the Popular Republican Movement (MRP) encountered an unprecedented defeat. Both the Communist Party and de Gaulle won. What do these symbolize? They symbolize dissatisfaction with the status quo and aversion to "bridge politics." The impatient French people may be thinking: the world is now divided into two groups, political systems and political forms, "if you don't belong to Yang, you belong to Mo," therefore, France must also choose a path to take!

Is this the general trend? The clear-headed Prime Minister Ramadier wants the people to think calmly, to think about the current French environment; is it to take a lopsided path with a great power? Or is it to maintain France's neutral position and take the middle path? The parliament voted a vote of confidence once or twice (the second time was 300 to 280 votes), the Socialist cabinet still exists, and Léon Blum's "fence-sitting philosophy," "bridge philosophy," and Britain's Laski philosophy still shine brightly on both sides of the English Channel!

How long can this situation be delayed? No one dares to make a reckless judgment. After the revival of the Communist International, Moscow's style will definitely be more "quick knife and bright head." Bulgaria's Petkov was sent to the gallows, Romania's Maniu entered the prison, and Poland's Mikolajczyk, who was repeatedly mentioned in my Polish communication in July, has now secretly fled to England, escaping from danger. The opposition parties in Hungary have almost all fled into exile, and Czechoslovakia is now in a turbulent situation. Europe is already intensifying the "unification movement," and the "bridges" of Western Europe are gradually losing their function. The Warsaw Declaration of the Communist International has clearly criticized Léon Blum and Ramadier, so Thorez (leader of the French Communist Party) sitting in Paris will certainly no longer seek compromise with the French Socialist Party!

Therefore, the "strikes" led by the French General Confederation of Labour, which is controlled by the Communist Party, will also continue to follow. The previous strike of 2,000 cleaners, storming the city government, almost caused a major bloodshed. Inflation, prices are continuing to rise, and the lack of supplies is cyclically fueling this terrifying winter!

Because there is no coal and the electricity is not enough, Paris is once again vigorously promoting "electricity conservation." There is no electricity in the city in the morning and no electricity in the suburbs at night. The London Mail's new headline says "Parisians Eat in the Dark." In fact, there are not many people in the city who really get up early.

What is still terrible is the food problem. The grain-made bread is also gradually being eaten up. The Russian wheat that the Communist Party has repeatedly declared was originally scheduled to donate 1.5 million tons to France, but now it has been reduced to only 300,000 tons, and it must be exchanged for French automobiles, textiles, and chemical fertilizers. France has an economic negotiation delegation in Moscow. The best thing is: the authorities in the Kremlin clearly told the French representative: the Soviet Union does not have too much food to supply to foreign countries, and besides, France is not a country worth supplying!

Is Moscow preparing to abandon this bridge, or is France itself changing? (At the Hotel Crillon in Paris)

### Legislative Yuan Elections Begin Yesterday; Campaign Propaganda Reaches Climax; Citizens Vote Can Maintain Order; Mayor Wu Personally Votes for Yen Hui-ching, Director Chang Prepares to Come Last

[Reported by This Newspaper] The first Legislative Yuan election in this city began at eight o'clock yesterday morning. The morning mist was still thick, and the roads were wet. After the citizens started their factories and sounded the whistles, they went to the polling places to vote one after another. Yesterday was the first day of voting, and it was not a holiday. Civil servants and office workers could only take time to vote during lunch and after work, so it was not very enthusiastic. It is estimated that the number of votes in the regional election yesterday was probably less than 200,000.

Mayor Wu Kuo-chen went to the third polling place in the Changshu District (Zhaoguang Middle School) at 9:10 AM to personally vote for Yen Hui-ching, a candidate backed by the government. It is said that the mayor's wife will vote at the same location at noon on the 23rd. Speaker Pan Kung-chan went to Beijing on official business and will rush back on the 23rd. It is speculated that he will also vote for Yen Hui-ching. Hsieh Jen-chao, secretary-general of the Kuomintang city party headquarters, voted for Yen Hui-ching at Zhaoguang Middle School after the mayor. Director Chang Kai-hsien also voted for Yen Hui-ching at the polling place in the Yuyuan Road-West Road area yesterday morning, expressing his satisfaction with the good order of this election. Director Chang Hsiao-sung, the chief executive of the election affairs office, was stationed at the election affairs office, contacting various parties by telephone all day, handling various emergencies, and giving instructions on everything. Chang said that he will still follow the precedent of the National Assembly election and cast the last vote at noon on the 23rd. The five members of the family will each support different candidates to show fairness.

### Military and Police Personnel Vie to Elect Wang and Fang

In this election for municipal legislators, most candidates are well-known figures with a substantial base of support, making the competition fierce. The outcome remains uncertain until the very last moment. Each candidate's ranking varies across different districts. In the Huangpu District, Wang Xinheng, Fang Zhichao, and Ma Junshuo hold a considerable advantage. Military and police personnel, in particular, almost unanimously voted for Wang and Fang. In the Changning District, as of last night's close, over 13,000 votes were cast, with Ma Shuli leading in the number of votes, followed by Yan Huiqing, Wang Xinheng, and Fang Zhichao, then Bu Wei, Cao Jun, and Xie Renzhao. In the Songshan District, due to the concentrated population, voter turnout was high yesterday, with Zhu Wende holding a notable advantage.

Rooftop Broadcasting Draws Attention

Zhu Wende set up a temporary radio station on the rooftop of a pseudo-foreign shoe and hat shop, with a loudspeaker extending onto Tibet Road. A Miss Li broadcast in Mandarin every few minutes, her melodious voice interspersed with popular songs, attracting considerable attention from passersby. The shop is only a few steps away from the Sino-French School polling station, making Zhu's campaign promotion both unique and effective.

In the Luwan District, it is estimated that approximately 5,000 people voted yesterday, with Wang Xinheng and Fang Zhichao receiving the most votes. In the Hongkou District, voters chose according to their identity, with military and police supporting Fang Zhichao and Wang Xinheng, and people from northern Jiangsu province selecting Ma Shuli. Yesterday, in the Jing'an, Yangjing, Xinjing, and Penglai districts, Ma Junshuo also held a considerable advantage in votes. Overall, yesterday's voting order showed improvement compared to the National Assembly election, likely due to increased experience. The dispute at the fourth polling station in Zhabei was an unfortunate exception.

Several Disputes

At around 11 a.m. yesterday, approximately two hundred voters swarmed to the polling station, demanding ballots based on their voter registration certificates. Zhao Xingqiao, the supervisor, refused because the individuals did not have identification cards, which did not meet the requirements. A conflict ensued, and Zhao was attacked. Following instructions from the election affairs office, voting was suspended for about an hour. Order was restored and voting continued after the police dispatched officers to the scene. Supervisor Zhao Xingqiao was exchanged with the supervisor of the first polling station in the district. The attacking crowd, mistaking "Zhao" for a homophone of "Cao," believed that Supervisor Zhao was the younger brother of candidate Cao Jun and was refusing to issue ballots to favor Cao Jun, leading to the conflict. Apart from this, there were minor disputes in the Yangshupu, Tilanqiao, and North Railway Station districts, but they were not serious and were resolved quickly.

Campaign Activities Employ Various Strategies

Yesterday, the campaign activities of the various candidates reached a fever pitch. Campaign slogans and promotional vehicles were visible everywhere at "strategic points" along the roads. Among the regional candidates, Zheng Yuxiu was the most generous in spending, using banners, slogans, promotional vehicles, and even distributing promotional pamphlets along North Sichuan Road in cars, as well as scattering small cards on the road to attract pedestrians. Fang Zhichao's campaign slogans were also quite cleverly researched. Many signs were posted in front of each polling station, reading "Those who vote for Fang Zhichao go this way." Many voters believed that they could only vote for the Wan family at this location. In the Zhabei District's first polling station, Ma Shuli and Ma Junshuo's activities were also the most vigorous, providing transportation for voters in trucks, benefiting both them and themselves.

Today is the second day of voting, and it is expected that the enthusiasm will surpass yesterday. Municipal Police Chief Yu Shuping will vote at the first polling station in the Luwan District this morning.

Leaving Stains Hard to Remove for Protesting the Kowloon City Incident

[Reported by This Newspaper] Student circles in this city protested the Kowloon City incident on the 17th of this month by gathering at the British Consulate and other locations on the Bund to protest and demonstrate. At that time, some students covered the consulate's gilded railing and the walls of several British companies, and even the Central Bank, with tar, writing slogans in tar. It is now known that the work to remove the tar writing is quite extensive, costly, and difficult to completely clean. According to Dalton, director of the Shanghai Chemical Laboratory, gasoline and kerosene are best for removing tar stains in general, but stone and cement absorb tar, so while the surface stains can be removed with the above-mentioned oils, traces will remain. Alternatively, caustic soda or a high-heat blowtorch can be used to heat the surface before wiping with gasoline or kerosene, but it is still impossible to completely clean it. Dalton stated that he will immediately experiment to invent a suitable cleaning agent to remove tar stains from stone and cement.

Professional Groups' Elections Held in Twenty-Eight Locations; Newspaper Workers' Voting Starts Today, Technicians' Procedures Not Yet Complete; Ding Jie and Lu Jingshi's Twenty-Three Vehicle Parade is Immensely Impressive

[Reported by This Newspaper] Elections for professional groups' legislative representatives were held enthusiastically at twenty-eight locations in the city throughout yesterday. Unlike the National Assembly elections, the list of candidates was printed on the ballot, and voters only needed to circle the name of the candidate they supported, saving them the trouble of clerical errors. In addition, voters had to present their national identification cards before voting, so order was well-maintained. Voters found the procedures simple and were already experienced with the election method, so the process went smoothly.

The candidates' promotional activities were in full swing, with large banners and colorful leaflets covering the streets. Among them, Lu Jingshi's parade was the most impressive. Starting at nine in the morning, the various labor unions gathered twenty-three promotional vehicles, which circled the city, adorned with colorful ribbons and flowers. Various factories took the opportunity to add advertisements to the vehicles, displaying electric fans and thermos bottles. After voting, workers from various factories in the Yangshupu area paraded in formation, singing songs in support of Lu Jingshi's campaign. According to the results of yesterday's all-day elections in the various labor union polling stations, Lu Jingshi led, followed by Ling Yingzhen (female). Some factories will close for the day today for the election, and it is expected that the number of voters will increase.

Professors Do Not Want People to Eavesdrop on Their Choices

Only professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants participated in this year's college faculty elections, so the number of participants was small. The voting situation yesterday was not enthusiastic. When marking their ballots, they did not want to be eavesdropped upon and went to a corner of the room to think carefully before hastily dropping their ballots into the ballot box. For this reason, no one could estimate which candidate in this group received more votes. Yesterday morning, Fudan University professor Zhu Sihuang went to Aurora University to vote, but the administrator verified that Fudan University should vote at the Fuxing Middle School polling station. A minor dispute ensued. Zhu insisted on exercising his right to vote as a citizen regardless of location, but the administrator believed that the ballot would be invalid if the ballot number did not match. The two sides debated politely, and in the end, Zhu followed instructions and went to Fuxing Middle School to vote.

Ou Yuanhuai Serves Oranges and Peanuts

Ou Yuanhuai, President of Great China University, set up a reception area in a small house next to the Aurora University polling station, providing oranges and peanuts to voters. Yesterday, Ou received the support of more than one hundred professors.

The most campaign banners are at the Great World Plaza, with dozens of red and white banners flying in the wind.

Ten Thousand Tons of Coal Rushed Southward, Divided Equally Between Nanjing and Shanghai

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Fuel Management Committee has already begun preparing for the city's coal needs in February and is confident in its ability to meet them. The committee will soon rush ten thousand tons of coal southward from the Xuzhou and Bengbu areas along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, with five thousand tons for Shanghai and five thousand tons for Nanjing. The committee will send Yang Yunfu to the Tianjin-Pukou line to oversee the transport of coal. In addition, at least five thousand tons of coal from Taiwan will arrive in Shanghai next month, and the committee has sent Commissioner Zhou to oversee the transport. Furthermore, there will be three to five thousand tons of foreign coal transported. Therefore, the city's coal supply for February should not be a problem. Furthermore, Zhang Shanyang, Deputy Chairman of the committee, has resigned, which has been approved by the ministry. The vacancy has been filled by Shi Xiangbei, who reported to work at the committee yesterday.

Adding Drivers, Tearing Slogans, and Cursing

Among special trade unions, the Telecommunications Union provided convenience for its workers, who are scattered in various locations, by first holding voting yesterday at the Fuzhou Road receiving office and the International Radio Station, and will move to the Yokohama Bridge General Bureau and the Zhenru Radio Station today. Among the candidates, many used promotional stickers and posted them on various vehicles. However, the owners of private cars strongly dislike this and often order their drivers to wash them off completely. As a result, drivers are often seen tearing off the stickers while cursing. Dongwu University converted a school bus into a mobile broadcasting vehicle and went to the streets to have its Law School Dean Xu Zhenwei give campaign speeches.

Some candidates also massively distribute campaign leaflets on the streets. However, after passersby briefly glance at these leaflets, they are immediately collected by street vendors to be used for wrapping peanuts and spiced beans.

The Engineers' election was originally scheduled to be held in Zhongzheng Park. Yesterday, the city's Election Affairs Office suddenly received a call from Nanjing stating that the group's election procedures were not yet complete and ordering a temporary halt. When it will resume has not yet been decided. The Journalists' Association is scheduled to vote today.

A Newlywed Arrested

[Reported by This Newspaper] Chen Huiting, thirty years old and an assistant manager at the Pudong Iron Factory, was holding his wedding ceremony with Li Jingru, a teacher at the Zhoupu Elementary School, at the Youth Association on Baxianqiao at around 4 PM. Suddenly, his legal wife, Ma Damei, found out and reported it to the Songshan Police Precinct. Police officers were dispatched and, at around 6 PM after the ceremony, Chen and Li were taken to the station for investigation. According to Ma, she has been married to Chen for nearly ten years and has two children. On June 29th of last year, Chen suddenly asked her to make a handprint on a blank piece of paper under the pretense of borrowing 100 dans of rice from a friend. Ma, unaware of his plan, agreed. Chen then used it to fill out a divorce certificate and completed the divorce proceedings at a lawyer's office. Chen believed his plan had succeeded, and then proceeded to hold his wedding with Li Jingru. The police precinct deemed that Chen was not without suspicion, and therefore detained him.

Haikang Ship Anchored Due to Fog, Arrival Postponed to This Morning

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Haikang ship, carrying the first batch of Japanese reparations goods, anchored at North Saddle due to fog at sea yesterday, preventing it from arriving yesterday. It is now scheduled to dock at the Zhanghuabang Wharf this morning. The handover ceremony will still be held as scheduled.

Postal and Telecommunications Price Hikes Without Legislative Procedures

[Reported by This Newspaper] Lawyer Cheng Mengming recently filed a complaint with the local court against Li Jinlu, the Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, requesting that the "underpayment" due to the "postal and telecommunications price hikes" be ruled invalid. The content of the complaint stated: "The postal and telecommunications price hikes concern the rights and obligations of the people. According to the regulations of the standard law, they should follow legislative procedures, otherwise they cannot be considered legal. Legal principles are not law, and laws must be passed through three readings, promulgated, and take effect on the date of arrival. Unless otherwise specified, it should not be retroactive. The State Council has the authority to formulate legislative principles, and while its expedient handling may be considered legal and effective, it cannot be considered law. Therefore, it cannot have legal effect. In past cases, the State Council has amended legal provisions through resolutions and ordered their implementation first, and while there are such precedents, given the above explanation, they are not in compliance. Now that the Constitution is in place, the old ways of doing things should not be followed again and again. The postal and telecommunications price hikes are without legal basis, and therefore the overcharged so-called "underpayment" is an unjustified enrichment." Cheng Mengming provided three points to explain his complaint: He filed a complaint with the local court on December 26th of last year. He is now refiling it because the court has not conducted a hearing on the case. This complaint is not against Li Jinlu personally, but for the benefit of the entire public. Legislative representatives express the will of the people, and the judiciary executes the will of the people. The court should not protect administrative officials and leave the case pending. According to the standard law, postal and telecommunications price hikes must be approved by the Legislative Yuan. The State Council cannot make such regulations.

Streetlights Added in Xuhui

[Reported by This Newspaper] There have been no streetlights along the Tianyaoqiao, Xuxie Road, and Xietu Road areas of the Xuhui District, making it inconvenient for pedestrians at night.

Hai Zhe Will Arrive in Yokosuka Tomorrow; Twenty-Six Boxes of Supplies Will Return to Shanghai

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] The Hai Zhe ship, the second of our country's ships to Japan to transport reparations goods, will arrive in Yokosuka at 7:00 AM tomorrow. It will load approximately 500 boxes of machine tools in Yokosuka and sail back to Shanghai on the 26th of this month.

In addition to the Hai Kang and Hai Zhe ships, our government has also leased three ships, including the 4,600-ton Yongxing, which will sail to Japan in February. A total of 1,600 boxes of machines and tools dismantled from the Tokyo Arsenal are now piled up in the Yokosuka port, waiting to be transported. At the same time, the dismantling of machine tools in Nagoya has begun and the boxes are now being packed. The total number of machine tools for reparations is 1,200, and they will be shipped by the end of February.

Shanghai Customs Embezzlement Case; Yin Lansun's Wonderful Testimony; Claimed He Didn't Understand the Use of US Dollars and Declared "Never Again"

[Reported by This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Shanghai Customs embezzlement case is still under investigation in the Capital District Court. Yin Lansun, the former assistant director of the Shanghai Customs and one of the main perpetrators, was questioned twice on the 21st about the details of the embezzlement. Yin confessed the process of committing the crime, which was very interesting. He stated that Zhang Yuan came to visit the first time, asking him to release the goods, but he refused. Zhang came to visit the second time and said that the goods were operated by Yue Xinmin's friends, and asked him to do it out of consideration for their relationship. He relented due to the friendship. Several days after the incident, Zhang sent him US$1,500, which he did not understand. After Zhang explained, he reluctantly accepted it and declared "never again." He did not know that this behavior was corruption. He asked the court to take this into consideration.

Dancing Girl Donates a Golden Pen Worth 80 Million to the Chairman

The city's dance hall industry's charity dance and auction has officially ended. The Paramount Ballroom donated the most, followed by the MGM. The detailed donation amounts will be officially announced by the Winter Relief Fund Raising Committee in the coming days.

The Winter Relief Fund's on-site personnel, representing Mayor Wu, donated it again for charity auction. Wen then bought it again for 40 million and presented it to the Chairman of the National Government. The golden pen has now been transferred to Mayor Wu by the Fundraising Committee, and Mayor Wu has agreed to present it to the Chairman.

The brothel called the police, who dispatched an ambulance to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### A Scene Woven with Blood and Tears: A Tour of Several Shelters; Their Encounters are Either Bandits or Disasters; The Life of Exile Contains Infinite Suffering

[Special Report by This Newspaper] Yesterday, this reporter visited several shelters in the suburbs to speak with the refugees being housed there. A scene woven with blood and tears, deeply imprinted on my mind, emerged. This scene, on the other hand of urban extravagance and dissipation, is such an unconcordant note, indeed like the vast difference between heaven and hell.

In the first shelter next to the Guanshengyuan Farm in Caohejing, a young man in his twenties from northern Jiangsu province tearfully recounted his unfortunate experience. He was from Funing, Jiangsu, and his family originally ran a cigarette shop and had 54 mu of thin land, which could be called a well-off family. Later, the Communists came, and needless to say, his family was the object of "struggle." The shop was looted and sealed, the land was confiscated and divided, and his brother was killed on trumped-up charges. He risked his life to escape to Shanghai to find his cousin, but because his clothes were ragged, he was arrested by the police on the street and sent to the shelter. He said excitedly: "Those who have been stimulated by the Communists know that the Communist Party is truly hateful!"

There was also an old man of fifty-four with gray hair. When he spoke, tears streamed down his face, and he kept shouting, "Bitter, ah, bitter!" He was from Peixian, Jiangsu, and worked as a farmer. He had 60 mu of land, but it had been devastated by floods and there had been no harvest for three years. This time, he came to Shanghai to seek refuge with his brother-in-law, but he was also mistaken for a beggar by the police on the street and sent in.

The Poorer You Are, the Less You Eat

In the Second Shelter near Sheng Sheng Ranch and the Third Shelter on Yangshupu Jun Gong Road, there were also many women, children, and the elderly. Their experiences were almost all the same: either bandits or disasters had ruined their families, destroyed their property, and the life of exile contained infinite suffering.

In the shelters, they had a set of cotton clothes, a cotton quilt, and two meals of rough rice a day, which kept them warm and fed, but they could not see their fathers and sons, and brothers and wives were separated. This kind of mental pain was enough for them to endure. The Relief Administration stipulated that each refugee's ration was two dou of rice per month and 50,000 yuan for vegetables per month. Two dou of rice a month might be enough for ordinary people, but the more unfortunate these people are, the more their stomachs expand. Not to mention adults, many small refugees also held their empty bowls and said, "We can't get enough to eat!"

### Several Reasons Why Refugees Flee

The First Shelter Houses

The First Shelter houses able-bodied refugees. Because it was established earlier, it is relatively on track. The management methods are completely militarized. In addition to food and lodging, they are also required to line up for exercises every day, and the administrators provide them with life education. The Second Shelter houses women, children, and the elderly, which makes it more difficult to manage. The Third Shelter was only recently opened, and because funds are limited and there is a lack of manpower, the order is not yet in place. Moreover, the address is combined with the reception center for unemployed workers in the rear, which makes management even more difficult. Some refugees who are unwilling to stay in the shelter flee at the opportunity.

Speaking of refugees fleeing from the shelters, it seems incredible at first glance. But yesterday, this reporter personally saw and heard several refugees asking to be let out. According to these people's statements, they can be roughly divided into several categories: one is that they are not refugees but were mistakenly arrested, one is that although they are refugees, their families are still wandering outside, so they would rather go out and share the hardships together. One is beggars and swindlers who were arrested. Their begging life is actually more comfortable than in the shelter, so they naturally hope to leave.

### Thumbing Up and Saying "Unlucky"

In the Third Shelter on Jun Gong Road, there was a child who looked like a little swindler who, with a flick of his thumb, vividly said, "I have fish and meat to eat every day outside. It's really unlucky to be caught here!"

The most heartening thing is that the Social Affairs Bureau has already started working on more than a dozen work-relief shelters to concentrate the able-bodied refugees and implement work-for-relief. This method is very worthy of encouragement, because according to this reporter's observation, simply giving refugees and vagrants food and lodging is absolutely not enough. This at most allows them to maintain the life of primitive animals. More importantly, they need to be given work to make their lives like a "human."

### Refugees at Two Shelters Start Ditch Dredging Work

[Reported by This Newspaper] The work-for-relief portion of the city's Winter Relief Society began yesterday. More than 500 refugees from the Third Shelter on Zhongshan Road, the Fourth Shelter in Hongqiao Town, and other shelters participated in the Puhuitang ditch dredging work starting yesterday. The ditch runs from Xujiahui, through Qibao Town and Sijing Town, directly to Qingpu and Songjiang. After completion, it will greatly benefit the transportation of rice to Shanghai from Qingpu and Songjiang. The Winter Relief Society is scheduled to invite Mayor Wu and Director Wu to inspect the site this Sunday.

### Seventeen International Gold Speculation Case Suspects Indicted

After the police cracked the international black market gold speculation case and transferred it to the district attorney's office, the handling prosecutor carefully reviewed all the case files and determined that the police's investigation of the case was extremely accurate. It was decided that no further investigation would be conducted. The suspects, including the main offender McDonald, have been separately indicted for disrupting the financial order. The indictment has already been drafted and is now being submitted to Chief Prosecutor Huang for review.

[Another report] The gold speculation black market case jointly cracked by the Financial Administration and the Shanghai Police Department is currently under investigation by the police. An extension of ten days for detention was previously requested from the district attorney's office, expiring on the 19th. Yesterday, the police again requested an extension of detention for one week. The prosecutor approved an extension of detention for five days.

### Jewelry Stores to Reregister Within Two Weeks

[Reported by This Newspaper] Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian said yesterday that jewelry stores in the city should reregister in accordance with the new regulations recently issued by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs. They will then be issued temporary business licenses after the Social Affairs Bureau approves their registration. After completing these procedures in two weeks, the issue of opening up the buying and selling of gold ornaments and the labor problems will be addressed, and there may be a solution.

### Foreign Girl Li Zhen: Scandalous Affairs Continue to Unfold; Arrested Late at Night with Shen Gongwei

[Our Newspaper's Report] The scandalous affairs of the renowned dancing star, Foreign Girl Li Zhen, and her "happy rivals," Shen Gongwei, have continued to unfold. Yesterday at 11 PM, Shen, along with Li, were drinking heavily at a restaurant, becoming quite drunk. Afterwards, they hired a car to return to Shen's residence at the intersection of Shaanxi North Road and XinZha Road. They went directly into Shen's father's bedroom, intending to stay overnight. Shen Gongwei's wife, Mao Xiuzhen, witnessed this. Although Shen had previously threatened her with a handgun, she could no longer endure it. She secretly reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station that her husband and Li were committing adultery. Police officers were dispatched to Shen's residence to make the arrest. At the time, Li was sound asleep, while Shen reluctantly opened the door, unable to deny the situation. He surrendered himself. The police station, considering the case as adultery, which requires a complaint from the spouse, advised Shen to reconcile with his wife. Mao Xiuzhen demanded 100 large gold bars as compensation for separation living expenses and child education and support, otherwise, there would be no room for negotiation. The case will be directly transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation this morning by the Jing'an Temple police.

### Post Office Mail Sorter: Embezzlement of Remittances Exposed After a Long Time; A Total of Two to Three Hundred Million Appropriated

[Our Report] On December 26th of last year, a person surnamed Bao remitted four million yuan from Taiwan to his mother's home at 530 Jing'an Temple Road in this city (the money had to be collected at the Shanghai Taiwan Bank). A few days later, another three million yuan was remitted. Subsequently, his mother sent a letter stating that she had not received the funds. Bao boarded a plane and returned to Shanghai, inquiring at the Taiwan Bank. He discovered that the four million yuan had already been collected by someone, while the three million yuan was still there. Bao immediately reported the situation to the Laozha Police Branch. Section Chief Jiang ordered officers Zhang Kui-dong and She Guo-zhen, along with personnel from the General Post Office, to investigate. After investigation, it was discovered that Zhang Yin-chang, a guest in room 4 of the Pacific Hotel, was suspected. Zhang was taken to the police station for questioning. Zhang confessed that the main culprit in the case was his elder brother, Zhang Jin-chang, who had conspired with accomplices.

Zhang Jin-chang worked as a temporary mail sorter at the Kade Road Post Office branch. Around September of last year, he secretly opened letters containing cash that were mailed from other cities to the Zhengfeng Bookstore on MeiBaiGe Road and the DaZhongHua Bookstore on Bak Road. He successively embezzled approximately thirty to forty letters without being discovered. He then conspired with ruffians Wang Gen-quan, Liu Ming-fa, Gao You-shan, Shao Chang-yao, Xia Qing-wei, Dong Zu-gen, and others to continue their illegal activities. The police station arrested the main culprit, Zhang Jin-chang, and others. According to their confession, they mainly targeted registered letters containing money orders. After forging seals and fraudulently collecting the remittances, they destroyed the letters. The following cases were recorded: Han Qi-feng Pharmacy at 1, Lane 270, Nanjing West Road, one hundred and forty million yuan remitted from Hankou to Shanghai; Zhang De-hong of Yingkang Cotton Weaving Factory at 3, Lane 70, Nanjing West Road, forty million yuan remitted from Taiwan to Shanghai; Liu Pei-jing at 8, Lane 318, Beijing West Road, five million yuan and another one hundred million yuan remitted from Zhenjiang to Shanghai; Xingren Customs Brokerage at 24, Lane 107, Huanghe Road, fifty-seven million yuan and thirteen million five hundred thousand yuan remitted from Taiwan to Shanghai twice; Shi Pin-shan of Yifeng Iron Factory at 46, Lane 353, Xinzha Road, seventy-five million yuan remitted from Hangzhou to Shanghai. There were also many other cases ranging from tens of thousands to over ten million yuan, totaling approximately two to three hundred million yuan embezzled.

### Review Committee for Encroached Civilian Land by Government Agencies to Hold Inaugural Meeting on the 24th

[Our Report] The Review Committee for Encroached Civilian Land by Central Government Agencies in Shanghai, under the Executive Yuan, is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at 3 PM on the 24th of this month in the City Hall's conference room, followed by the first meeting. The committee's task is to review and determine whether the civilian land used by various government agencies should be retained or returned.

### Field Survey of Gutian Silver Mine: Fujian Province's Great Wealth Source Eagerly Awaits Development

[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 19th Dispatch] The silver mine at the Zhulin Township silver field in Gutian County, Fujian, which had been forgotten by the world, is now once again attracting the attention of the Chinese people, especially overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia. The mining of this ore deposit began during the Xuande period of the Ming Dynasty. At that time, the national treasury's silver reserves relied on the output of this town's mines. However, due to the corruption of the court at the time, as well as the corruption and oppression of those responsible for overseeing the mining, bloody resistance was sparked among the miners, which led to the cessation of work. With the passage of time, the YinChangg silver mine, this great wealth source of Fujian Province, was forgotten by the Chinese people.

A reporter recently responded to an invitation from the Nanqiao Economic Construction Company and went to the site with construction engineer Chen Qifa to conduct a survey. To be able to finally see the true face of this mine that has been buried for hundreds of years is something I personally consider fortunate.

When we turn to the records of the History of the Ming, it is not difficult to prove that the amount of silver contained in the mines around YinChangg Town surpasses that of other provinces. In 1937, the Resources Committee of the Executive Yuan sent more than 30 engineers to conduct a survey here. According to their report, all the mines within a 20-kilometer radius of YinChangg Town produce silver. Unfortunately, the mining work could not be realized due to the outbreak of the "July 7th" Incident the following year. Years ago, the U.S. State Department also sent three engineers to conduct an on-site investigation. Their report also stated that the ore deposit could be mined to a depth of 300 meters and that the silver quality contains about 97% pure silver. The lowest estimate of the mine's output is about 400,000 tons or more. The mining work will require at least more than 400 years to complete.

Today, the town has a sparse population and the mines are surrounded by weeds. Talking about the past with the villagers brings forth sighs of regret and lamentation. This is because during the reign of Emperor Xuande of the Ming Dynasty, tens of thousands of laborers were conscripted to mine this ore. However, due to poor management at the time, the imperial envoy and the supervising officials were corrupt, causing public resentment. Even more unfortunately, a mine pit suddenly collapsed, and all the laborers inside were buried alive. In their extreme anger, the people lured the imperial envoy to inspect the mine pit and buried him alive to show their revenge. Emperor Xuande was furious about this and issued an order: All people within ten li of YinChangg Township would be executed. This mining project was then halted. Now, the residents here have all migrated from other places in recent years. Today, when talking about the matter of opening the mine with them, they all are terrified at the mention of "silver".

As for this silver mine, one of the great sources of wealth in Fujian Province, the reporter hopes that it will be developed as soon as possible. It can not only help alleviate the current national economic crisis, but also contribute to the economic prosperity of the country. We deeply hope that the government will lead overseas Chinese to invest and actively and rapidly develop this source of wealth!

### Yumen Covered in Four Feet of Snow: Mining Production Continues Steadfastly

[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 17th Dispatch] Guo Ke-quan, assistant manager of the China Petroleum Corporation and manager of the Gansu-Qinghai branch, flew from Jiuquan to Lanzhou yesterday (the 18th), accompanied by Jin Kai-ying, assistant manager of the company. Mr. Jin continued to Shanghai by the same plane, while Mr. Guo stayed temporarily in Lanzhou on official business.

This morning, the reporter visited Mr. Guo and inquired about the purpose of this trip and the recent situation of the Yumen mine. According to him: This trip to Lanzhou is purely to negotiate with the Gansu Provincial Government for the purchase of food for the employees, as the mine has nearly 10,000 employees and requires more than 4,000 shi of food per month, which must be purchased and stored in advance.

The cold front hit Yumen in early November last year, and the temperature at the mine has consistently been below minus 28 degrees Celsius until today. The snow at the mine is more than four feet deep, causing some of the machinery to freeze and crack, and production has been reduced to a semi-suspended state. From the end of November, the mine mobilized more than 3,000 employees to carry out emergency repairs in the icy and snowy weather. During this difficult period, they still managed to maintain production. Before 1946, the refinery used distillation furnaces. Last year, a semi-cracking oil furnace was added. In terms of quantity, the cracking furnace produces 80% to 100% more than the distillation furnace. In terms of quality, the cracking method can increase the output from 19% obtained by distillation to 35% to 38%. After the oil pipes of the cracking furnace were frozen and cracked, only the distillation furnace is currently working, so the production has been sharply reduced. However, compared to any past winter, the output is still the largest, because in the past, after October, all the machinery was often in a state of hibernation. The area of the mine's oil fields has increased fourfold compared to two years ago, reaching 50 square kilometers. There are more than 300 oil wells, but only a dozen or so are regularly producing oil. The main product is gasoline, followed by kerosene and diesel, and paraffin wax is a by-product. The new well-drilling and oil refining equipment purchased by the mine, totaling more than 6,000 tons, are currently concentrated in Shanghai. In addition to some of the equipment that has been delivered by air for urgent use, most of it must be transported to Hankou and then transported westward via the Sichuan-Hunan Highway. Recently, there are even plans to transport it to Tianjin and then to Ningxia via the PingSui Railway. Whether the production increase plan for this year can be realized depends on whether this equipment can be delivered in time. The 4.5-ton Dodge trucks that the Materials Supply Bureau plans to sell to the company have been gradually transported to Hankou and are currently being negotiated for transportation westward.

### Township Chief Falsely Accuses Good People of Theft: Footman Punished in Retaliation

[Our Newspaper, Lanzhou, 16th Dispatch] Zhang Huai-ren and Yang Sheng-cai, road workers of the Lanping Section of the Seventh District Highway Engineering Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, had a dispute with a footman on the 30th of last month for hiring a donkey to carry wheat. Unexpectedly, Li Huai-jin, the township chief of Shuangqiao Township, where the road work team was located, harbored resentment because the road workers had been too conscientious in protecting the trees on the road, having prevented his large iron-wheeled vehicle from driving on the highway. He took the opportunity to instigate the footman to falsely accuse the road workers of robbery. Township Chief Li even colluded with the Pingliang Self-Defense Force and sent troops to rush into the road work team's house at 10 PM that night, arresting nine people, including road workers Zhang Huai-ren and Duan Wei-dong. They were subjected to torture, resulting in serious injuries. After the Pingliang District Court investigated, it was discovered that Zhang and Duan had been falsely accused. They were acquitted a few days ago, and the footman was punished in retaliation. After learning of this, the Seventh District Highway Workers' Union expressed strong dissatisfaction that Township Chief Li Huai-jin relied on his power to act recklessly and falsely accuse good people of theft, and that the Pingliang Self-Defense Force aided and abetted the wrongdoing without being punished according to the law. It convened a board meeting, and in addition to submitting reports to the military and political authorities for thorough investigation and prosecution, it also sent a telegram to all union members to express their support.

### Yu Shu-huai Stabbed to Death: Murderer Arrested in Rong County

Yu Shu-huai, director of the Sichuan Construction Bank, was a business tycoon in Sichuan, residing in Gongjing Township, Zigong City. On New Year's Eve last month, a thief broke into his room at night, attempting to steal 50 million yuan in deposits from the safe. When Yu discovered him, he shouted to catch the thief, and the thief struck him on the head with a sharp weapon and fled with the money. Yu was seriously injured. His family hired Dong Bing-qi, director of the Health Department, to treat him in Zigong on the next day, with a special car for the price of one billion yuan. He eventually died of his injuries on the fifth day. The murderer was arrested in Rong County four days after the escape and escorted to the Zigong Court for trial. According to the confession, his name was Liu Hou-dun, formerly an employee of the Sichuan-Kang Inspection and Management Bureau. He had been unemployed recently and asked Yu for help, but was rejected. Feeling resentful, he did this. He also said that Yu was a newly emerging business tycoon in wartime. Due to favorable circumstances, he became wealthy and was deeply envied by his salt industry counterparts in Zigong. Therefore, they bought him to do this. After the murderer was arrested, he was escorted to the scene of the incident for on-site verification. He tried to escape on the way and was shot dead by the military police. Yu was one of the richest men in Sichuan Province. In 1942, he became famous for donating 10 million yuan in national salvation donations.

### Reclamation Project in Coastal Fujian: Transforming the Sea into Farmland Is Under Planning

[Our Newspaper's Fuzhou Dispatch on the 15th] Fujian Province is mostly mountainous, and arable land is extremely scarce. In the past, food production was insufficient to meet its own needs. Since last year, the local authorities have been requesting assistance from the "Executive Yuan" to manage the reclamation of beaches in coastal counties, raising freshwater and turning it into fields, in order to enrich the people's food supply. Since the project began, all parties have placed high hopes on it. However, since the beginning of this year, as a result of the "Executive Yuan's" funding being tight, some projects have been stranded halfway, which is a great pity. For this reason, the provincial government, through the National Water Conservancy Conference, requested a comprehensive development. However, due to the enormous funding required and the inability of the treasury to support it, it was suspended. We have recently heard that the Ministry of Water Conservancy has attached great importance to this and has telegraphed Fujian to inquire about the reclaimable area and value, intending to instruct the province to do its best to supervise local people's organizations to operate independently. Our reporter recently interviewed personnel from the Water Conservancy Bureau who had previously set out to various places to investigate the actual situation. The planning of the coastal reclamation projects in Fujian Province at the current stage and their current situation are recorded below:

The coastline of Fujian Province is still quite long. From Beisha [illegible] Port, Sanhe Bay, and the mouth of the Min River in the north, to the coastal counties in southern Fujian, all are

A seawater eroded area. During high tide, it is a vast expanse of water. During low tide, the coastal area within one or two li (Chinese mile) is all "Hai [illegible]" (that is, mudflats with extremely rich salt content). In such places, apart from the few shellfish that are produced on weekdays, little is gained. If it can be reclaimed and seawater prevented from entering, in two or three years, it can all be easily turned into fertile land. Moreover, this type of land is very rich in salt, and grains are very easy to grow. Once reclaimed, the profits will be great. In the spring of last year, the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau organized teams to conduct surveys along the coasts of eastern and southern Fujian. At that time, it was discovered that there were reclaimable coastal areas in the seven counties of Linsen, Lianjiang, Luoyuan, Ningde, Fu'an, Xiapu, and Fuding in eastern Fujian, totaling twenty locations, with an area of ​​389,520 mu (Chinese acre). In addition, there were twenty-one locations in the nine counties and cities of Fuqing, Pingtan, [illegible]tian, Xianyou, Tong'an, Hui'an, Jinjiang, Kinmen, and Xiamen in southern Fujian, with an area of ​​198,790 mu. In total, there were sixteen counties and cities in the province, with forty-one locations, covering a total area of ​​588,310 mu. It is estimated that after all the freshwater is raised, the annual increase in food production can reach 2,718,190 dan (Chinese bushel). Later, because the

Project was too large

It was not possible to start comprehensively, so twenty-six locations with greater economic value, covering 218,340 mu of land, were selected for preliminary execution. These twenty-six locations include: Jiadeng Township in Linsen County (500 mu); [illegible]xiang Township in Lianjiang [County] (11,500 mu); Songhuoxiang Township in Luoyuan [County] (15,880 mu); Xi[illegible]tang in Ningde [County] (10,000 mu); Wanwu Township in Fu'an [County] (750 mu); Shaha Pond in Xiapu [County] (6,000 mu); Dongge District in Fuqing [County] (8,700 mu); [illegible]kou in Pingtan [County] (34,000 mu); Beigaodaishi in [illegible]tian [County] (510 mu); Huoshaogang in Pingtan [County] (10,000 mu); Doumencun in Xianyou [County] (6,000 mu); Neizhou Port in Tong'an [County] (8,600 mu); Tang[illegible] Port in Tong'an [County] (470 mu); Ma Port in Tong'an [County] (4,630 mu); Baiqi Port in Hui'an [County] (13,500 mu); Houzheng Village in Hui'an [County] (2,080 mu); Qing Shandong[illegible] in Hui'an [County] (200 mu); Wuli Bridge in Jinjiang [County] (1,150 mu); [illegible]bao in [illegible] [County] (11,700 mu); Hanjiang Township in [illegible] [County] (4,500 mu); Si[illegible]hou in An [illegible] [County] (415 mu); Ya Tou in An [illegible] [County] (465 mu); Haimen in [illegible] [County] (7,100 mu); and Taipu in Tanpu [County] (3,500 mu). Among them, more than ten places, including Xi[illegible]tang in Ningde, have been under construction for years.

During construction

Funding mostly relied on the support of the Executive Yuan, and wages were all replaced with flour, with a slightly semi-work-semi-relief meaning. Unfortunately, the good times did not last, and it stopped halfway. Over the years, Fujian Province has been short of food, and famine has become a disaster. On the other hand, the coastal areas are overpopulated and unable to go abroad to make a living, resulting in wasted labor and an increasing number of displaced people. Now, if we want a win-win solution, there is nothing better than speeding up such projects. First, we can guide the millions of vagrants to the right path of farming; second, we can lay the foundation for the province's future food supply. However, the issue of funding for this [development] is quite complicated.

According to the province's previous plan, for this project, in addition to the [quantity] design and other aspects being the responsibility of the province, the subsequent

Reclamation work

Must be managed by the county and city governments or local people [themselves]. Considering the county's current financial situation, the prospects are not optimistic. However, considering the benefits after the completion of the project, it is believed that there will be no shortage of people [willing to contribute] their strength. Science is, after all, a [way to] overcome [difficulties]. If these many reclamation projects can be completed, then there will be no shortage of food in the future.

Beet Sugar Factory——Funds should be planned, equipment purchased, and factories established to centrally produce beet sugar, and small machines should be promoted separately so that rural production areas can also operate in a decentralized manner.

Food and fuel should be circulated within the province as [illegible]. When necessary, exchange with neighboring provinces should be sought. Hides, furs, animal products, and herbal medicines are the top ten products of the province and should be concentrated and transported out for sale by the trading company as much as possible. The trading company should gradually expand the business of purchasing raw materials, manufactured goods, machinery, and transportation equipment and selling finished products on behalf of companies and groups outside the province. Cooperatives at all levels should strive to improve their organization and develop their business to cooperate with provincial state-owned industrial, mining, and trade institutions to form basic units for production, sales, and distribution. A transportation company should be set up to handle import and export acceptances, increase the volume of trade, and coordinate the transportation tools of public business agencies by the Highway Bureau to negotiate the improvement of military transportation control and strengthen transportation functions.

### On the Tongji University Student Unrest, Hang Liwu Expressed: Trust in President Xi's Handling; Hopes to Still Adopt a Moderate Attitude; Students Remained on Hunger Strike Yesterday and Have Not Resumed Classes

[Report from this newspaper] Tongji University students are protesting the school's repeated expulsion of students. Yesterday, they still did not resume classes and went on a one-day hunger strike, transferring the funds saved from food to the student union's expenses. Because the students did not resume classes, the school authorities announced the names of students expelled for the third time, namely Li Fa, Rong Zheng, Yin Bangyan, and Zhu Wenxiu. In addition, students Huang Renduan and 13 others were each given two major demerits and two minor demerits, and placed on probation. Students Zhang Chun and 17 others were each given two major demerits. Yesterday, the students' emotions tended to ease, and it is feared that they will not resume classes in the short term.

Tongji University President Ding Wenyuan issued a "Notice to Students" yesterday. The full text is as follows: "Recently, a small number of students in our school have engaged in transgressive actions. In order to maintain law and order and rectify the academic atmosphere, the school authorities have taken appropriate measures, taking into account the principles of caring for students and giving lenient treatment, in order to maintain law and order and rectify the academic atmosphere, and have repeatedly advised them. In addition to publishing announcements for everyone to know, we have also issued notices to students twice, explaining in detail the school's position and the course of events. We originally hoped that all students would understand the school authorities' position and painstaking efforts, encourage each other, restore order, and concentrate on their studies, so that the school would be peaceful and tranquil. Unexpectedly, as of today, the order on campus has still not been restored. Although there are law-abiding students who are eager to attend classes, they are also coerced and unable to do so, and various manifestations have intensified, and they are threatened by a long-term strike. Such behavior is truly heartbreaking. It must be known that our school is a national university, and students are cultivated by the state. Should they abide by the laws and regulations promulgated by the government? Can they distort the facts and oppose the fair measures taken by the school authorities in implementing the rules promulgated by the Ministry? This is self-evident. This is one. Students use the name of petition to carry out coercion. On the 15th of this month, they surrounded me in the director's office, forced the director of training to sign, cursed and hit, and various other behaviors. Is this the attitude that students should have towards their teachers? If there is no other role in deliberately disrupting, why be so arrogant? This is two. The school selectively punishes to maintain discipline. On the 13th, two students were expelled, both of whom had major demerits and had repeatedly failed to repent. On the 17th, five students were expelled, three of whom were also students who had previously violated school rules and were placed on probation. On the 19th, four students were expelled, two of whom had also been placed on probation. Moreover, the punishment case on the 19th was decided by the Provisional Administrative Council, but because the class leader of the highest grade came to see us and was willing to find a way to persuade us to resume classes on the 20th, we specially reserved it for one day. Unexpectedly, on the 20th, the strike continued, and there were some elements with other intentions who deliberately obstructed other students who were willing to attend classes. There was no intention to repent or change, so we had to announce it on the 21st. It is extremely obvious that the school authorities have done their best to be lenient and unwilling to implicate others. This is three. For this reason, I will not hesitate to give earnest advice again, and I hope that all my students will take into account the reputation of the school and their own studies, consider this incident in a calm manner, do not be used, and do not be afraid of threats. Restore order immediately and go to classes as usual. Otherwise, if the situation expands and serious consequences occur, even if the students do not follow, it will be difficult to shirk responsibility. Be careful not to neglect!"

[Also reported] Deputy Minister Hang Liwu of the Ministry of Education responded to questions from our newspaper reporter yesterday, stating: Regarding the student unrest caused by the re-election of the student union at Tongji University, the Ministry of Education trusts President Ding Wenyuan's handling completely, but hopes that Ding will still adopt a moderate attitude to guide the young people onto the right track. The students' request to amend the student union's constitution will not be considered.

Deputy Minister Hang gave an impromptu speech on the situation of China's participation in the Mexico City WCOTP Conference, and stated that he felt that there were several points that should be improved during this conference: The geographical distribution of personnel was uneven, with very few Asians and a large number of British and French. Technical talents could not be coordinated. The Chinese delegation proposed to abolish the working groups and restore the subcommittee system. The conference time should be limited to three weeks. Currently, all parties are extremely interested in the WCOTP organization. This year's conference will be held in China, and the 1951 conference will be held in the United Kingdom to make the conference's influence spread more widely throughout the world.

### National Universities in Peiping and Tientsin Cooperating to Launch Five Campaigns

[Xinhua News Agency Peiping Telegram] National universities in Peiping and Tientsin are currently fully cooperating to carry out the following five campaigns: 1. Telegram to the Ministry of Education requesting that, starting from January, the regular expenses of national universities be increased by at least three times the adjusted amount in December of last year. 2. Starting from January of this year, salaries will be paid based on the cost of living index. The Ministry of Education is requested to allocate funds as soon as possible so that universities can pay salaries according to the new regulations. If these funds cannot be allocated immediately, permission is requested to use the existing cost of living subsidies from January to June in the national treasury to pay salaries for January and February. 3. It is reported that the Executive Yuan has stipulated that all civil and military agencies should streamline their organizations and dismiss redundant staff. It is not yet known whether the education sector is included. The Ministry of Education is requested to clarify that educational and cultural institutions cannot be compared with general administrative departments. Educational and cultural institutions hire teachers, staff, or researchers based on their needs, and the employment of professors has a fixed term and cannot be terminated at any time. It is hoped that this regulation of the government will not include the education sector. 4. It is reported that special subsidies for teachers and staff in schools above the vocational level will also be cancelled starting from January. The academic research subsidies and special office expenses provided by the government are originally very small. The Ministry of Education is requested not to cancel them and to make reasonable adjustments. 5. In the past, the food expenses for students on public funds in various limited schools were one-seventh of the basic amount (i.e., more than 140,000 out of 990,000). There is no clear regulation on the provision of food expenses for students on public funds in the current adjustment method. If calculated based on a base number of 30 yuan times 115,000, each student would require more than 500,000 yuan. Universities have no such public funds to advance. The Ministry of Education is requested to promptly formulate regulations on the provision of food expenses to provide guidance.

Reserved seats inside the venue are temporarily suspended. The first match is Jianle vs. Chenbai, the second is Chen You vs. U.S. Air Force, and the last is Shantou Team vs. Topeka.

In the Group A2, Section A match between Jianle and Chenbai, the former is experienced and has considerable strength with the participation of Zhou Jun, Chen Yong'an, Chen Chuliang, Jin Kun, Wang Lido, and others. After the expansion of Chenbai, it has gained Ni Zhiqi, Yang Xiehe, Yuan Peiyuan, and others from Jiaotong University, greatly increasing its strength. A fierce battle is inevitable when competing with Jianle.

In the Group A1 match between Chen You and the U.S. Air Force, although Chen You lost both matches against Encas and Hualian by a one-point margin, its strength has been fully demonstrated. Especially in the match against Dagong last week, it defeated Dagong by half a goal, shocking the basketball world. The U.S. Air Force has balanced strength, but lacks coordination. It will undoubtedly lose when it meets Chen You today.

In the third match, a main battle in Group A1, the Shantou Team meets Topeka. The Shantou Team was originally a leading strong team, but after Cai Yanxiong left the team and Lin Wei returned to his hometown, its strength has been greatly reduced. It must work hard when facing a strong enemy tonight. The schedule is as follows:

Today's Schedule

Jianle - Chenbai (A2A) 5:30 PM

Chen You - U.S. Air Force (A1) 6:30 PM

Shantou Team - Topeka (A1) 7:30 PM

### Governor Zhang of the National Bank Returned to Shanghai Yesterday: No Decision Yet on Industrial Loans The Joint Treasury is Studying Loan Methods

Mr. Zhang Jia, Governor of the Central Bank, returned to Shanghai from Peiping yesterday and went to the bank to work. According to relevant sources: Regarding the restoration of industrial loans, the Joint Treasury is collecting opinions from all parties and studying loan methods. No concrete decision has been made as of late. The authorities attach great importance to the economic difficulties in North China. The Joint Treasury will decide on the various demands put forward by the North China Petition Group, including the restoration of industrial loans. As for the barter trade between the North and South, it should be handled immediately. The only problem is the difficulty of transportation.

Regarding the issue of relief supplies, the government is coordinating the matter to make a reasonable distribution according to the needs of various regions throughout the country.

### Selling Pressure Covers the Market Most Chinese Stocks Decline

Chinese stocks yesterday did not escape the tight money situation. Guanglian fell again, showing signs of mid-session nervousness. Trading was very light, small stocks were lifeless, and Xinyi Factory broke through the 100 yuan mark, once falling to the limit.

Morning was weak. Yongsheng Yarn was immediately traded at 725 yuan. Without opening, Yongsheng Yarn immediately fell from 725 yuan and 731 yuan to 700 yuan and 705 yuan. It then rose slightly to 708 yuan and 718 yuan. The off-market interest rate opened at 3.3 and 3.75 corners, and retreated to 699 yuan and 705 yuan due to selling. The off-market asking price was still high, once rising to 710 yuan and 720 yuan. There were many sellers for forward delivery and closing immediate delivery, so it fell to a low price of 688 yuan and 696 yuan. Fuyi was suspended from trading due to falling to the limit. Yongsheng Yarn closed at 693 yuan and 700 yuan in the afternoon, compared to the previous close. Immediate delivery stock Xinyi fell to the limit. Qinxing, Zhongfang, Tongyi, Commerce, and Huafeng each fell by 10%. Rongfeng, Datong, and Yonggong fell slightly, and the rest fell by 5%. Forward delivery stocks Meiya and Hua fell by 10%, and the rest fell by 5%.

Only immediate delivery was done in the afternoon. Yongsheng initially entered at 705 yuan, but was sold to 693 yuan in general. The National Bank had limited access, and then entered at over 700 yuan. Trading was very scarce, and then fell to 692 yuan. The money situation gradually eased, and then rose to 702 yuan. The closing price was 700 yuan. Compared to the morning closing price, immediate delivery stocks Xinhua, Qinxing, Xinguang, Commerce, Datong, Match, and Yonggong were flat. Rong, Lian, and Lian suffered small setbacks, and the rest of the stocks rose slightly. Off-market unlisted stocks remained in a weak state, with selling exceeding buying.

### Unified Bonds Decline, Foreign Stocks Mediocre

Government bonds were even more depressed yesterday. Unified C opened at 80,000 yuan in the morning, and retreated from 81,000 yuan to close at 72,000 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, A and B were down 4,000 yuan, C and E were down 6,000 yuan, and Type D was also down by a small 5,000 yuan. The turnover was 4 million.

Foreign stocks were mediocre and changed little yesterday. Each stock fluctuated very slightly. Hong Kong Electric also stopped at 3.35 yuan. Yisha opened at 530,000 in the morning, and the high price did not exceed 550,000, and then it was slightly flat. Securities brokers bought, while Guang brokers and foreign firms sold. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha, British Alliance, Jardine, Shipping, Tram, and Xiangtai suffered small setbacks, and the rest were flat.

### Four Banks and Two Bureaus Adjust Internal Exchange Rates

The exchange rates of the Four Banks and Two Bureaus in various regions will be adjusted from today as follows: Guangzhou 120 yuan (originally 130), Wuhan 70 yuan (originally 80 yuan), Yutao 2 yuan (originally 10 yuan), Nanchang 40 yuan (originally 35 yuan), Jingdezhen 50 yuan (originally 40 yuan), Jiujiang 40 yuan (originally 35 yuan), Ningbo and Shaoxing 5 yuan each (originally 8 yuan), Haimen 30 yuan (originally 35 yuan), Linhai 30 yuan (originally 35 yuan), Chongqing 8 yuan (originally 2 yuan), Chengdu 8 yuan (originally 2 yuan), Henan District 70 yuan (originally 60 yuan).

Regarding the restriction of internal exchange to prevent hot money from concentrating in Shanghai and stimulating prices, the restriction method is still being discussed by the Ministry of Finance. It is reported that national banks and bureaus have now begun to individually implement restrictions on internal exchange. All remittances to Shanghai from various regions are strictly reviewed individually, while there are no restrictions on remittances from Shanghai.

Furthermore, the industrial and commercial sectors feel that the national banks and bureaus' individual implementation of restrictions on internal exchange is quite difficult, because some legitimate merchants sometimes rely on remittances from the mainland to use as working capital. In the absence of restrictions, their legitimate remittances will inevitably be unable to meet the needs of smooth exchange. Therefore, the industrial and commercial sectors hope that national banks and bureaus can provide a flexible method for the remittances of normal merchants when restricting internal exchange, so that the funds of legitimate merchants will not be unable to circulate.

### Deposit and Loan Interest Rates Increased Money Situation Slightly Eases in the Afternoon

The posted interest rates of the silver and money industry changed yesterday. The deposit daily interest rate was changed to 1.1 yuan (originally 1 yuan). The loan daily interest rate was changed to 7 yuan (originally 6.5 yuan). The interbank daily interest rate was changed to 5 yuan (originally 4.5 yuan). The treasury bill daily interest rate was changed to 5 yuan (originally 4.5 yuan).

The money situation was tight yesterday morning and slightly eased in the afternoon. In the bill exchange, the Four Banks and Two Bureaus had a difference of 37.3 billion yuan, with a total of 104,616 bills exchanged, totaling 3,299,303,988,000 yuan. The dark interest rate was 2.8 to 3 corners, and the certificate discount interest rate was 3.3 to 3.7 corners.

### Existing Silver Shop Organizations to be Renamed Money Shops by Ministerial Order

[Our Correspondent in Nanking, 21st] In order to reorganize financial institutions, the Ministry of Finance has recently issued an order to all silver and money shops throughout the country to change their names and adjust their organizations. The first step is to rename all existing silver shop organizations as money shops, and those currently called silver companies will be renamed banks. The second step will be to adjust the legal organizations of money shops and banks so that the money shops and banks after the renaming can comply with the law, and personnel will be sent to conduct random inspections at appropriate times.

### Rice Arrivals Flood the Market Market Continues to Weaken

Yesterday, a total of more than 13,500 shi of grain arrived in the North and South markets, and a large number of Wuhu indica rice arrived in Shanghai, totaling more than 8,000 packages. The cargo owners were very eager to sell, and the market continued to decline. Indica rice fell sharply by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, and lower-middle grades of japonica rice and early thin rice fell sharply by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan.

Soybean cakes were slightly taken in Shantou, but all items fell, and there was no lack of caution. High-priced goods were still fixed, and the central gate returned by a small 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

Shantou slightly absorbed yellow soybeans. The market was firm in the morning and slack in the afternoon. As a result, Du Huang was still weak, guest soybeans were fair, and tea soybeans in Beihua were moving but not prosperous. There were many suppliers, and those seeking goods were picky and slightly took goods, reducing the price by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Red beans were scarce, continuing to fall by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Cowpeas were flat, with few changes. Broad beans were not refreshing, weakening by 10,000 yuan.

The market opened at 1,242,000 yuan for white japonica, 1,240,000 yuan for Baiyangjian, and 1,324,000 yuan for Baiyuan, with a difference of slightly more than 10,000 yuan.

The rest of the edible sugar and foreign goods were all declining in unison.

### Fuzhou Trade Statistics for December Last Year

According to statistics, Fuzhou's import and export trade for December of last year totaled 125,138,788,000 yuan in exports and 113,088,133,000 yuan in imports, with a trade surplus of 11,050,644,000 yuan. Compared to November, exports increased by 19% and imports increased by 55%. Local specialties such as fir wood, bamboo shoots, paper, and tea accounted for 90% of exports, totaling 108 billion yuan. Imports were mostly composed of Jiangsu and Guangdong cloth, cotton, flour, and seafood.

### China-India Trade Not Yet Prosperous

Yu Qingbo, Chairman of the India-China General Chamber of Commerce, returned to China from India a few days ago and said that the total number of overseas Chinese in India is about 20,000, with more than 10,000 in Calcutta alone. The overseas Chinese in Calcutta mostly manufacture leather and woodenware, but the largest overseas Chinese merchants are mostly in Kalimpong on the border between Tibet and India, with more than 10 million yuan of capital, specializing in transporting tea from India to Tibet and wool from Tibet to India for sale in Europe. Trade from India has not yet become developed after the war. Before the war, the cost of camphor transported from Japan to India was higher than that of camphor transported from the United States to India, so Indians mostly switched to buying American goods. In addition to cotton, India's exports to our country include steel wire, but steel wire is prohibited from being exported by India, and gunny sacks are difficult to export due to high freight costs. Therefore, trade from India is not prosperous.

### China Farmers Bank Yesterday Auctioned Expired Unredeemed Tea

China Farmers Bank was ordered to hold the first auction of export tea pledged goods that expired and were not redeemed this year. The bidding was opened at 3:00 PM on the 21st at the bank. In addition to representatives from the Joint Treasury and its branches attending the auction, representatives from the Tea Export Association were also invited to participate. The event did not end until around 6:00 PM. It was publicly revealed that a total of 1,193.62 city dan, equivalent to 1,991 boxes, were auctioned, including 1,7109 boxes of Ping Lv, 151 boxes of Qihong, and 131 boxes of Ninghong, divided into 33 types, totaling 25,977,911,700 yuan. Due to the recent weak bottom, the prices were all about 30% higher than the bottom price. A total of eleven bidders won the bid, namely Jardine Matheson, Huaan, Tong Taixiang, Xinhua, Wuchang, Shanghai Tea Company, etc. It is reported that the bank still has 1,390 boxes that were not auctioned, equivalent to 985.48 city dan, totaling 13 types, totaling approximately 2,470,983,700 yuan.

### Domestic Tea Market Active

The rising tide of the tea market has not yet subsided. After domestic production tended to shrink, the holders of goods all believed that the goods in their hands were a rare commodity, and their willingness to sell did not relax slightly. However, the export of tea was still in a firm and quiet situation because the purchasing enthusiasm of exporters repeatedly hesitated. Domestic sales of colored varieties, both the street and the customer gang, had an end to inquire, and the vortex process was still active, and the market developed extremely quickly. Looking at this situation, there may be a continued upward trend in the future.

### Cotton Yarn Negotiated Price Reduced; China Textile's Outport Allocation of Yarn Begins Application Process

The National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, in view of the recent decline in commodity prices and the less vigorous trading in the yarn and cloth market than before, has decided to slightly reduce the negotiated price of jointly allocated yarn based on market conditions. Yesterday, China Textile's listed price for jointly allocated yarn was reduced to 33 million yuan for 20-count yarn, a reduction of 7.5 million yuan compared to the negotiated price on Monday of this week. Furthermore, China Textile's allocation quota for outport yarn for this month began its application process yesterday.

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual, totaling 368 pieces, including 79 pieces from Baoxian and 17 pieces from Jiangdu, totaling 515 pieces of 20-count yarn, with 87 purchase orders. The selling price remained unchanged.

Yarn Prices Fall Again: Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions at the opening were sluggish, with industry players taking a wait-and-see approach due to the approaching Lunar New Year, and customer groups were also inactive. Furthermore, with the opening of yarn sales by China Textile Construction Company and the reduction in negotiated prices, market sentiment was weak, and sales were plentiful, causing the market to fluctuate downstream. However, towards the close, powerful players absorbed some at lower prices, and the market slightly rebounded. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell another 1 million yuan compared to the previous day, while other coarse and fine yarns also decreased by around 500,000 to 1 million yuan.

Cotton Cloth Called Lower: Yesterday morning, the cotton cloth market opened with continued tightening of credit, and dealers were selling a lot, but actual sales were sluggish, and new purchases were inactive. The market was mainly dominated by clearing transactions among industry players. Guangbang was heavily selling twill, and scattered households and storefronts were cutting prices on fine cloth. As a result, the final 12-pound Longtou and other fine counts consistently fell by 2 to 4 million yuan. In addition, twill, straight tribute bleached cloth, and fine twill also decreased by 3 to 5 million yuan. However, dyed cloth and shirting remained stable. Yesterday's market in Renzhao County was due to the payment for allocated goods today, and manufacturers continued to experience sluggish silk sales and a lack of profit, leading to a sharp decline at the opening. 120-count Xu-character bright yarn initially opened at 88 million yuan, then traded at 7.5 million yuan, with the lowest point dropping to 6 million yuan in between, before recovering to 7 million yuan at noon. In the afternoon, there were transactions at 7.2 million yuan, resulting in a decrease of 5 million yuan compared to the previous day.

Factory Yarn: Yesterday's market also saw no actual sales, and all levels of prices declined, approximately 3 to 4 million yuan lower than the previous day. High-count zero-lot immediate bills traded at 91 million yuan with one or two transactions. The sales of Qianjing yarn were also stagnant, and quoted prices also fell by 1 to 2 million yuan.

Silk Goods: Yesterday's market saw Huaqiang Zhensi quilt covers decline by 4%, with one transaction at 1.3 million yuan at the opening. Subsequently, due to tight credit among industry players, many became nervous and cut prices, resulting in a straight downward trend. The closing price for immediate delivery was 39.8 million yuan, and for deferred delivery, it was 40.2 million yuan. Other silk goods also softened due to lower raw material costs and scarce actual sales.

### Cotton Loan News

[Our Dispatch] It is rumored that the third cotton loan of 70 million US dollars has been signed and allocated. Our reporter specifically inquired about this with the person in charge of the National Bank's Business Bureau, who stated: "There is no such thing." And refused to make any other comments.

### Cotton Merchants to Hold General Meeting to Organize Joint Venture

[Our Dispatch] The contract for the Yarn Management Committee to entrust the city's cotton merchants' association to purchase cotton was delivered to the association yesterday. The association held a group meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the contract. It is reported that the contract has 14 articles, and the content is similar to the previously announced cotton purchase principles. However, cotton merchants believe that there are still some technical aspects that need to be negotiated. After discussion, an opinion was formed, and a general meeting of members will be held to determine the allocation of purchases for each member, and then proceed to organize a joint venture to carry out the purchase.

### Cigarette Supply Exceeds Demand, Continues to Fall

Yesterday's cigarette market opened with wholesalers replenishing their stocks, and trading was not bad, with quoted prices rising. Subsequently, it was reported that Yizhong Company was distributing Nanwei Three Cannon Towers and Qiantang higher-grade cigarettes, and Dahua Tobacco Company was also distributing "Paul Kang" cigarettes, 10 packs per household, with an allocation price of 46,000 yuan per pack. Industry players' positions became tight again, and many sellers were selling heavily, causing the market to collapse. In the afternoon, there was also news that Huacheng Company would be distributing Meili cigarettes, and the market was full of selling pressure, with quoted prices showing further decline. The final 10 packs of British Old Knife and Liangpai cigarettes continued to fall by 350,000 to 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day, while other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also uniformly declined, ranging from 500 yuan to 56,000 yuan.

### International Trade Practice

— Xing Guangyi

By An Zhijie, published by The Commercial Press

Before the war, China's trade was bound by unequal treaties, putting it at a disadvantage. Most of it was controlled by foreign merchants, and import and export trade was mostly handled by foreign firms. Until the Anti-Japanese War, the government adopted a controlled trade policy to meet wartime needs, but because the import and export of goods in the occupied areas could not be controlled, and international routes were limited, it was difficult to develop freely. After the victory, China's import and export trade greatly expanded, and domestic import and export firms sprung up like mushrooms. International trade is a complex business, and there are various technical issues in buying and selling transactions that need to be deeply studied. There are already many books on international trade theory on the market, but there are few books that focus specifically on international trade practice, and even fewer that are practical. The author of this book, based on his practical business experience, provides a systematic description of international trade practice. Although this book focuses on trade techniques, it makes many contributions to the theoreticalization of international trade practice. It can not only be used as a suitable textbook for university business schools related to international trade, but also a good reading material for those engaged in international trade.

The book consists of five parts and nineteen chapters, in two volumes, totaling 497 pages. In the general introduction, the author first explains the various difficulties and complexities of international trade. The so-called complexity and difficulty are technical issues. One must have proficient international trade techniques to overcome difficulties and protect against possible dangers in trade. The author especially emphasizes that the creed of international trade survival is "mutual benefit first," avoiding tricks and honoring promises.

Part One, on Sales and Purchases, elaborates on the terms, methods, prices, and preparations of sales and purchases in four chapters. Regarding the currency system for prices, the author believes that after the war, China has jumped to become one of the four powers, and all trade should adopt an autonomous policy. The first thing is to insist that import trade be priced in China's national currency. This view is reasonable, but under the current circumstances, it may not be possible to achieve it in a short time.

The basic method of selling and buying is "offer." The so-called "offer" is "one of the parties to a transaction proposes certain sales and purchase terms to the other party, indicating a willingness to sign a legally effective sales and purchase contract in accordance with the law." When engaging in exports, it is even more common to adopt the means of "borrowed offer," that is, if one has no goods in hand, after receiving an "offer" from a foreign buyer, one does not want to purchase the goods in advance, and does not want to lose the transaction opportunity, so one consults with domestic suppliers to ask for a borrowed offer, also limiting the acceptance period. After borrowing it, one sends a telegram to the foreign buyer. If the transaction is concluded, the goods are purchased from the domestic supplier at the original borrowed offer price. This method was commonly used by foreign firms residing in China before the war, and most domestic exporters in China did not understand international trade management, and allowed foreign firms to exploit them at will.

Part Two, on Documents, mainly discusses the types, nature, functions, forms, production, acquisition, and acquisition procedures of documents. The commonly used symbols and texts on various documents are explained at any time to explain their principles. The types of documents include sales contracts, purchase orders, letters of credit, bills of exchange, bills of lading, warehouse receipts, various insurance policies, various invoices, and pattern code lists, etc. In addition to explaining the opening and production procedures, detailed examples are given for reference and adoption, which is quite practical.

Part Three, on Cargo Transportation, first explains the packaging method and mark form and the procedures for determining ship positions, and then elaborates on the procedures for loading ships and customs declaration, and includes various application documents such as export declaration forms, foreign goods import declaration forms, inspection certificates, foreign exchange purchase certificates, and loading manifests.

Part Four, on Finance, mainly discusses foreign exchange issues, explaining that export foreign exchange is sold by export merchants and purchased by the government or banking industry in national currency, while import foreign exchange is purchased by import merchants and received by the government or banking industry, which sells it in national currency. All foreign exchange conversions are a kind of buying and selling, and import and export merchants must sign buying and selling contracts with the government or banks to comply with the procedures. The author lists the methods of buying and selling contracts and explains the principles of the content of the contracts. Secondly, the method of export trade capital turnover is described, that is, by means of mortgage and packing loans, attempts are made to use bank funds to turn over. This is the bank's own business, but operators must be familiar with the various procedures involved. The author details the processing procedures of various procedures and the various forms of application for reference.

Part Five, on Claims, first states that if there is a shortage or damage in quantity, the responsibility should be carefully investigated and compensation should be claimed from the transport company and the insurance company. If the quality is inferior and changes, the circumstances should be considered and compensation should be claimed from the seller. The author has clear solutions based on various different situations.

The above is an overview of this book. Here, I will further comment on my impressions:

Overall, the book is clearly organized, with the wonders of integration and echoing back and forth, and without the disadvantages of repetition and contradiction. It is clear and simple, allowing readers to progress step by step and easily understand. This is its strength.

This book focuses on trade techniques. The application document formats are widely and richly collected. The terminology and symbols used in technology are explained in detail, and examples are given. If the meaning is not complete, additional notes are added at the end of each section to supplement it, and the details are not tired of. It is necessary to make readers thoroughly understand. Because to engage in international trade, one must be proficient in foreign languages, especially English as the basis. Whether it is the principles or techniques of practice, this book tries its best to annotate in English, which contributes a lot to the application of readers. An English index is attached at the end of the book, which is especially convenient to find information according to the map.

To engage in import and export trade, one must be familiar with the techniques involved to avoid suffering losses. The gains and losses in between affect the profit and loss of a transaction. The author has many places in this book that provide very detailed hints on the technical aspects, which readers can easily study and understand, and is worthy of cherishing.

### History of the French Revolution

— Qing

By Albert Mathiez, translated by Yang Renpan, published by The Commercial Press

The introduction of Western historiography to China has a history of nearly thirty years, but the translation of famous works of Western historiography into Chinese is few and far between, especially national history and specialized history. What I am going to introduce here is a famous work and a famous translation that has been completed after the author's lifelong research and the translator's several years of translation and annotation. It can not only be used as a reference for friends who study history, but also has a profound influence on the social life of our time. It is indeed a book that deserves special introduction.

When we mention Western democracy or the Western way of life, we often trace the background of its institutions and spirit to the French Revolution at the end of the eighteenth century. Indeed, human political and social life has historical origins. To explore all the psychological, institutional, and even material factors that constitute modern Western life, one must often trace back to the long past in order to discover its origins and development. This kind of echoing is very helpful to our research and understanding, and has become an indispensable and important step. European political, social, and historical scholars all pay special attention to the French Revolution, because the French Revolution has a great external and internal influence on Western democracy and the Western way of life. For more than a hundred years, the study of the French Revolution has achieved brilliant results, and these studies are accompanied by the organization and analysis of extensive and precise historical materials. Especially in recent decades, due to the opening of sealed historical materials, the expansion of the scope of historical materials, the discovery, organization, and analysis of new materials, and the great progress in technology and methods, the progress of Western scholars in the study of the French Revolution can be imagined, especially French scholars. Their spirit and methods are worthy of our attention.

Albert Mathiez was an outstanding historian of modern France. He devoted his life's energy and time to specialize in the history of the French Revolution. He is indeed a good model for modern scholars to study. His research on the French Revolution can be said to have reached the peak of Western scholars' research on the French Revolution to date. No one in the world is more correct than him. He did not follow any philosophy of history, and the only focus of his research spirit and attitude was to seek truth. He paid close attention to the economic life of that era, but he was not an expert in economic history. His focus was still on parliament and political parties. He also paid attention to the personal factors in history, which is completely different from the materialist view of history that completely obliterates personal factors. He only emphasized the role of economic factors. On this point, he and his teacher, Olar, the authoritative scholar of the history of the French Revolution at that time, had decades of debate. His view of the French Revolution is

His view of the French Revolution is comprehensive. Although he emphasizes economic factors, he does not dismiss the role of accidental events. What is especially valuable is his use of materials. He used as much original material as possible, such as newspapers, magazines, and pamphlets of the time, local government and Parisian government archives, personal diaries, letters, and memoirs. Under his careful and detailed analysis, these original materials have become useful and valuable historical materials, and constitute the flesh and blood of his papers and works. His initial research was limited to the question of education during the revolutionary era, but later his research expanded to all aspects of the revolution, especially parliament and political parties. And he has conducted thorough research on each stage of the revolution. His lifelong works are almost all specialized research papers, and these three volumes of "History of the French Revolution" are the only comprehensive works he has organized and written with the results of his lifelong research, and are the crystallization of his lifelong research. They have their own consistent attitudes and methods, which are naturally significantly different from general comprehensive works written by others.

Although the writing of this book is refined and careful, it does not lose its vividness. Because the author believes that academic research and historical works are different. The task of historical works is to "reconstruct" and "express" the "history itself." Academic research is analytical, while historical works are comprehensive. The "History of the French Revolution" is the author's comprehensive work. The author attempts to "insert a painting of the French Revolution with various forms, and try to be correct, clear, and vivid as much as possible." (See the author's original preface). Various complex social factors are arranged in an orderly manner in this book, showing a high level of organizational achievement. The original preface also states: "This book is based on a large number of documents, some of which are unpublished documents, and is interpreted with an independent critical spirit." From this, we can see the author's spirit, learning, and techniques. And because the writing is vivid, although it is a specialized work, it does not feel obscure. As for the years included in this book, it is from the Estates-General to the New November Coup. This starting point aroused much criticism at the time, but later it was agreed by most scholars as reasonable. The author has another monograph connected to this book on the period from after the New November Coup to the Directorate.

In addition to the original work, the Chinese translation of this book is also worthy of special introduction. The translator is one of the few scholars of modern Western history in China, and is also an expert in the history of the French Revolution. In his early years, the translator specialized in the history of the French Revolution under J.M. Thompson at Oxford, and wrote a paper "Saint-Just" under Thompson's guidance (already published in Chinese by The Commercial Press). Thompson is a famous scholar of the Mathiez school. Therefore, the translator's research on the history of the French Revolution has its own lineage of the Mathiez school. The translator has his own unique understanding and appreciation of Mathiez's spirit and methods of scholarship. During the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, the translator's main work in the rear, in addition to lecturing on the history of the French Revolution at the university, was the translation of this book. During the translation, in order to be detailed and precise, he also referred to the English translation and corrected some errors and omissions in the English translation, so this translation is more faithful and complete than the English translation. As for the translation names, he also referred to various specialized books and set five principles (see the translator's preface), which shows the translator's careful attitude and precise methods. As for the translation style, it is a direct translation that shows the meaning of the words, which is faithful and clear. And the writing style can closely match the original work. Although it is a direct translation, it does not feel awkward.

In addition, there are two points about the Chinese translation that are worth special introduction, namely the annotations and the appendix. The original work was written for general readers and omits annotations. But Chinese readers, especially Chinese readers who do not specialize in French history, will definitely feel difficult. The translator referred to various specialized books and made detailed annotations. In order to facilitate readers' reference, the translator also added five appendices. Among them, "Chronicle of Major Events of the French Revolution," "Table of Depreciation of the Mandate Tickets," and "Comparison Table of the Revolutionary Calendar in the Second Year of the Republic" can be used for inspection and comparison. "Overview of the Research on the History of the French Revolution" and "Mathiez and the Research on the History of the French Revolution" are written by the translator and can help readers understand the process and achievements of the research on the history of the French Revolution and the attitude and methods of the original author. The value of these five appendices can be imagined.

In the year of the inauguration of the constitution, an understanding of Western democracy is urgently needed, and this book meets this need. We are willing to sincerely introduce this work and this translation.

### Reading "Yong Yuan Ci Chao" (Collection of Ci Poetry from Yong Yuan Garden)

— Shuishen

Great literary works often arise in times of chaos and upheaval. The An Lushan Rebellion produced a Du Fu. The impact of this eight-year War of Resistance is immeasurably more profound than that of the An Lushan Rebellion. We should have many soul-stirring, immortal works worthy of the title "poetic history," to leave for future generations to read.

In Chongqing, due to the scarcity of paper and the difficulty of printing, many works have not been published, or at least we rarely see them. This summer, Master Juanhe sent me a copy of "Yong Yuan Ci Chao" from Nanjing. I had been too busy with personal matters to read it carefully until the end of the year and the beginning of the new year, when I had a little leisure to peruse it leisurely.

This is a collection of ci poetry by "exiles" who entered Sichuan, compiled by Yang Gongshu. The preface states: "I once traveled up the river to Sichuan with my wife and settled in Yong Yuan Garden in Shapingba, Yixian County. We both loved to write ci poetry and had a strong desire to collect it. The following year, the War of Resistance broke out, and many contemporary ci poets gathered in the Southwest. We heard many discussions. After nine years, following the story of Hong Ji Gongjin, we compiled this collection, also to record our association. However, limited by resources, we only tasted a small portion of the soup. Moreover, the favors of various families came at different times. Each time we obtained a collection, we immediately sent it to the printers, without having time to edit or arrange it. Therefore, we named it 'Ci Chao' (Collection of Ci Poetry)." The preface was completed in January of the 35th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1946], and the proofreader was Zhou Guangyu.

This anthology includes the ci poetry of eight authors: "Qing Meng Ci" by Ye Shisun, "Ling Suo Ci" by Wu Baitao, "Bo Wai Le Zhang" by Qiao Dazhuang, "She Jiang Ci" by Shen Zibi, "Jia An Ci" by Wang Dong, "Nan Yun Xiao Gao" by Tang Guizhang, "Nian Yuan Ci" by Song Ci, Shen Yinmo, "Juan He Jin Ti Yue Fu" by Chen Feishi, and an appendix of old-style poetry entitled "Jiu Shi Yue Se Qi Shi," also by Chen Feishi.

"Juan He Jin Ti Yue Fu" is titled "Ma Xie Ji" (Collection of Hemp Sandals). It has a postscript that reads: "I began studying ci poetry in the year of Wushen [1908]. After the age of fifty, my old friends Shao Cigong and Wu Qu'an often urged me to publish them. In the summer of Dingchou [1937], I had just finished writing three volumes and was about to discuss them with my two friends when the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred. My two friends passed away one after the other, and the old drafts were shelved. I set three rules for myself: to adhere to the rules of prosody, to be appropriate and smooth, and to avoid vulgarity and triviality in terms of artistic conception and overall tone, aiming to discipline myself, but I have not yet succeeded in graduating. These are works from the last seven years, and I dare not be confident in them, seeking improvement only." Although there are not many ci poems in the "Ma Xie Ji," I privately love one or two of them.

Bu Suan Zi (Divination Song)

Half the dream, each has... work, I compose this interpretation:

The horns of high autumn are broken, the sword is cold in the distant night, and lights flicker in the eyes of the wilderness. The moon shadow is faint, and the skinny horse has passed this road. Truly. Wet military uniform, old tears scattered in the wind. Towards... Continuing the journey like a crowing rooster, when will the floating mist and fog be broken? Good scenery is lightly cast aside.... Holding the golden immortal in the dew, there is nothing to be done about parting sorrow. Across the bank, the Western Mountains, hidden, like a pair of locked, dark eyebrows. Who can? Entrust my longing thoughts to the Liaocheng arrow. Listening to the remaining music while drunk by the flowing water, how sad it is to harmonize with the county's difficulties.

Shan Xi (Mountain Stream)

Hearing of the victory at Yichang on Double Tenth [October 10th]

Distant flutes and drums break through the evening haze of sorrow. Recalling past travels thirty years ago, embracing the Yellow Crane Tower, ascending halfway to the heavens. The rivers and mountains have two warnings: don't treat them like paintings. How many evenings, the moonlight was clear, lingering, illuminating the golden goblets filled to the brim. A good wind blows, carrying the sail shadow, following the Xiang River's turn. Pointing towards Jiangling for thousands of miles, the waves in the middle of the gorge display clouds for the first time. Youthful face with white hair, may dreams return home early. Beautiful land, stained with... carnage, whose house are the lights illuminating?

The entire book is one hundred and twelve pages long, filled with elegant words and beautiful phrases, each copy is invaluable.

Ye Xing Chuan (Night Boat) by Ye Shisun - Remembering Nanjing

Dreaming of the beautiful land of the Southern Dynasties. The east wind passes, the grass is dizzy, the flowers are drunk. Like a painting of the river and sky, the flock is startled and dances in confusion, making up the bright beauty of late spring. Not chasing after the rise and fall of dynasties before one's eyes. The places of joyful revelry have all become places of sorrow. The New Pavilion is well, but who is there to face? In vain, shedding tears towards the setting sun.

Tai Lan Hua (Magnolia) by Qiao Dazhuang

Youth often gets drunk in Jiangnan. Discussing songs to repay the wine's intention. In the mirror, one does not believe that the tides rise and fall; downstairs, you can see the depth of the water. Telling of longing thoughts across a thousand miles. Limited fragrant wine, limitless matters. Returning swallow feathers, returning geese to the north, my wife eats orangutan lips, my husband... carp.

Jian Zi Tai Lan Hua (Abbreviated Magnolia) by Shen Yinmo

Talking with Jiyuan [Wang Dong], feeling moved, I compose this and present it to Jiyuan.

Winding mountain paths, the houses of people across the ridge seem close but are actually far away. The same river and sky, it's not as good as Jiangnan for launching boats. These three years are vulgar, laugh at my lifelong thoughts of entering Shu. East of Wanli Bridge, it's hard to have a sentiment that surpasses Fang Weng [Lu You].

A small tripod [work], it ends here. The book does not state where it was published, nor does it have a fixed price, as it is not for sale.

### Hardy and His "The Return of the Native"

— Shibei

(Written by Thomas Hardy, translated by Hai Guan, published by Zhengfeng Publishing House)

(I)

In recent years, American publications have included specialized studies of Thomas Hardy: Lord Robert Cecil's "Hardy the Novelist" and Carl J. Weber's "Hardy in America." Both books focus on the study of Hardy's novels. This proves that Hardy's works are still respected by readers and have lasting value.

Hardy was born on June 2, 1840, in Dorchester, Dorset, England. His family was in the building trade. At the age of sixteen, he became an architectural apprentice in Dorchester. At the age of twenty-two, he worked in the architectural firm of Sir Arthur Blomfield in London. There, he worked in architecture during the day and studied at the University of London in the evenings. He also worked hard at writing, publishing many novels, collections of poems, and essays, six or seven of which are considered great works of English fiction. He died in his hometown on January 11, 1928, at the age of eighty-two.

Having read Hardy's novels, we can vaguely glimpse his view of life. In his world, the position of mankind is the least important. Studying human intelligence and work is not enough for us to understand the mysteries of the universe, and the main rationality or irrationality of things. Man is not only constrained, suppressed, and insulted by his fellow men; he not only struggles with his fellow men; his misguided fate is not only caused by his fellow men; our world is full of unpredictable changes, and man, since he is born into this world, must be subject to the environment.

Because Hardy's view of life starts from this angle, his artistic ideal is Greek tragedy. He respected and inherited the spirit of the great Greek tragic poets Aeschylus and Sophocles, and he loved reading their tragedies. In 1880, he also read Schopenhauer and Hartmann, whose works deeply influenced Hardy's thinking. His novels unfold before us with a strong atmosphere of sentimentality.

(II)

If we first understand Hardy's view of life and his literary and artistic creation points, and then read "The Return of the Native," we can see that in "The Return of the Native," he has brought his art and his philosophical beliefs to their full height, so that his views on life are fully expressed. Because "The Return of the Native" has a complete, balanced, and appropriate structure, it has become the greatest and most outstanding of Hardy's tragic novels.

At the beginning of this book, Hardy wrote the following poem:

"I have said goodbye to sorrow,

I want to leave her far behind;

But she, joyfully, joyfully,

Clings to me intimately;

She is so faithful to me, so kind.

I want to deceive her,

And leave her from now on,

But, alas! She is so faithful to me,

So kind."

This poem lingers affectionately in our minds. It is the keynote of the novel, running through the entire story, beginning with sorrow and ending with sorrow.

The whole book is divided into six parts: Part One, Three Women; Part Two, The Return; Part Three, The Uneasiness; Part Four, The Closed Door; Part Five, Discovery; Part Six, Aftercourses. The background depicted by the author is the Egdon Heath, containing a hint of confusion like a dream; it is desolate, mysterious, and almost a symbol of the objective, ominous forces of nature, silently watching the fate of the men and women who live within this region. The first section describes: "This place now completely matches human nature - neither terrible nor hateful, nor ugly; neither ordinary nor vulgar; but like mankind, it is neglected and continues in monotonous twilight with only its vastness and mystery. Being with people who have been living alone for a long time, loneliness seems to have lost its color. This is a lonely place, suggesting the possibility of tragedy." That is the background of "The Return of the Native," which the author has personified.

The story begins with fireworks on November 5th. Red lights rise one after another, decorating the entire countryside. Bunches of pale yellow light radiate in fan shapes around the dense air. The destinies of the tender Daisi [Eustacia Vye] and the beautiful heroine Wu Sidaisha [Eustacia Vye] are concentrated in this environment. The middle is the transition to welcoming Klin Yuebolai [Clym Yeobright]'s return from Paris. And take marriage as the final outcome, first Daisi's marriage to Weidifu [Wildeve], and then Wu Sidaisha and Klin Yuebolai's marriage. But these two couples are not satisfied with the love they have obtained, so on January 5th of the following year, they encountered an accidental fire signal, which caused Wu Sidaisha and Cheng Difu [Wildeve] to flee on a dark and rainy night. In the end, they both tragically drowned in the wilderness's waters. In the tragic stormy night, in the shining whirlpools and white foam, that is the destination of love.

However, in the "Aftercourses" of the novel, the author allows us to see, through the sad tragic atmosphere, a thread of sincere and simple union of a newly born love, and a life of eternal devotion to duty. The former is Daisi and the humble red earth peddler - Di Geli [Diggory Ven] Huai En's [Wildeve] marriage; the latter is Klin Yuebolai ending his life on Rainbarrow in evangelistic work. Although some critics say that this part is superfluous, I cherish it, just as Hardy uses the hymn to eulogize Daisi's revived love:

"She calls her lover from above the mist,

Oh, come in,

The dew is so thick, so thick!"

At this point, we can see the disillusionment of love, and also the rebirth of pure love.

(III)

In "The Return of the Native," Hardy brings out his certain sense of drama, the appropriateness of the atmosphere and layout, and the tight structure, all of which make its content extraordinary. From the perspective of the description of scenery, "The Return of the Native" is also the most successful work. Hardy believes that scenery is the primary element of a novel, and an indispensable thing for the development of the story. In "The Return of the Native," he uses his poetic pastoral method to express the image of the scenery. This is what we should pay special attention to. J.W. Cunliffe once said: "The Return of the Native" is a magnificent building; its story moves lightly at the height of human destiny, without haste or wasted effort, and the technique is very perfect, the subtle places, we only understand after careful examination. Touching or humorous scenes follow one after another, and we follow with ever-increasing attention to the designated destination; we see how each tiny part appropriately constitutes the complete whole."

This explains the creation technique of "The Return of the Native." I think this should also be the most appropriate evaluation for "The Return of the Native." If readers are tired of Hardy's tragic novels, reading "The Return of the Native" will certainly not be "tired," but rewarding.

### Giving and Receiving

— Heku

I think one of the reasons why everyone likes the Lunar New Year more than the Solar New Year is because in the few days approaching the Lunar New Year, we can more or less get a sum of money in addition to our monthly salary and allowance, as long as you work in a business, organization, or institution where even making a living is difficult. This sum of money is sometimes called a year-end bonus, sometimes a year-end allowance, sometimes a profit-sharing, but it is an extra part of the income.

In this city, I don't know how many families rely on this extra sum of money, let's call it "year-end funds" for now, to get the warmth that they can't get on ordinary days. For example, children may be able to eat some sweets that they usually long for but are difficult to obtain easily, wives may be able to wear a piece of clothing that they usually see in the window but can't afford, and they themselves may dare to invite a few close friends to their home for a lunch that is slightly more lavish than usual... etc. If there is no year-end fund, then even if the aforementioned warmth is requested like a fleeting udumbara flower, it is difficult to achieve.

As usual, these year-end funds, judging from the individual names such as "year-end allowance," "year-end bonus," and "profit sharing," are mostly issued voluntarily by one party, and should be released naturally at a certain time, just as plum blossoms should bloom in spring and chrysanthemums should bloom in autumn. But the reality is not so. Today's "year-end funds" must be fought for and demanded before they can be obtained, which also shows the seriousness of the general situation of "difficult times, barren years, and empty family fortunes."

In fact, the distribution of year-end funds is still beneficial to the "market." Because the general "receivers" who have long lacked warmth, after receiving this money, still "give" it to society. No matter how withered the year is, or how urgent the scenery is, they always exchange some things to take home. The family certainly gets warmth, and at the same time, the market also gets warmth. From this point of view, the giving party should be calm and generous in opening their wallets.

To this day, this year-end fund is no longer about savings, but a kind of hope and bestowal, a kind of warm giving and receiving. If there is spring in winter, it is that one party reveals a fleeting beauty on a heavy face after giving and receiving.

### On Diaries

— Lu Naizhen

Some people keep diaries, some people don't. Probably, more people don't keep diaries. I also don't keep a diary. I think that ordinary diary keeping is like keeping a running account or writing a dry and uninteresting record of daily life. Keeping it for a long time seems like a kind of punishment, something that must be done every day but is unwilling to do. It's like a poor man who has never eaten any nutritious food before. Suddenly, he has money and quickly buys a five-pound can of Klim milk powder. He eats it happily for the first few days, but after eating it for a few days, well, he can't stand eating it anymore. All the nutrition and delicious taste have become a kind of punishment. If he doesn't eat it, the milk powder will spoil. If he eats it, he's tired of eating it. So, he has to swallow it hard, or ask someone else to eat it. Keeping a diary is the same. At the beginning, you keep it with great energy, but after a month or two, you become impatient. You keep it one day and skip one day, and after another month or two, you simply stop keeping it altogether. No wonder Robert Louis Stevenson, the author of "Treasure Island," said that keeping a diary is a "practice of a profession," and you must have the spirit of going to the office on time to be able to keep it from beginning to end.

If you say that a diary is a trace of life, that's not entirely true. You can't record the two major events of a person's life, birth and death. As for some trivial things, like "Mother sent a letter today...", "Damn it, we ate turnips again for lunch, there was an uproar in the dining hall..." These things can neither be used as material for writing an autobiography after you become a celebrity in the future, nor are they precious "traces of life." As for the major events of one's life, such as first love, marriage, university graduation, etc., even if you don't write them down, the process before and after will be firmly engraved in your heart.

Personal diaries are inevitably peeked at by others, and there are many things that you often can't boldly write down. Diaries can sometimes show your true feelings, but there are also many cases of offending friends or even ending up in prison because of this.

I don't keep a diary. I would rather write down some things that are worth remembering as independent novels or essays, so I don't have to be afraid of people peeking at them, and I can also practice writing. The plot in a novel is like a rope of memory, which will lead me to think of a large area of past events.

Keeping a diary was originally the best way to start learning to write, but unfortunately, most people keep it as a dry and uninteresting running account, so that it has nothing to do with literature. Being able to write down the major events and feelings of the day in a few lines of notes, like Mr. Hu Shi's "Cang Hui Shi Da Ji," is certainly easy. Otherwise, as Mr. Zhu Guangqian said: "You don't have to predetermine the number of words you should record every day, as long as you record what should be recorded just right, whether it's hundreds of words or dozens of words, you don't have to be restrictive. You also don't have to record many things at the same time in one day. If you record too much, you will inevitably be like 'counting radishes to store in the cellar,' and you will never remember them well. Selection is the most important work of literature. You select one thing worth remembering every day, and record it properly, turning it into a 'work,' that's enough." Otherwise, it's better not to keep it, to avoid suffering "punishment" in vain.

### Churchill's Secret

Churchill had a kind of preparation before speaking. He said to himself, "Don't panic, speak according to what I want to say." When he stood up to speak, he always swept his eyes over the audience, and then reassured himself, "These below are all idiots!" Then he felt very natural when speaking. (Camel)

### Indian Funeral

— Mang

More than one million people in India burn incense and pray every day, hoping to be cremated in the prominent charnel ground after death.

After a person dies in India, the body is immediately moved out of the house. Men are wrapped in white cloth, while women are wrapped in red cloth. However, those who die from terrible diseases such as leprosy or smallpox, as well as children, are not wrapped at all, but simply thrown into the Ganges River.

The ceremony of carrying the dead to the cremation ground is very simple. There is no so-called hearse. The dead body is only tied to a bamboo pole and carried on the shoulders of two relatives, walking to the river while singing.

After arriving at the river, they give the dead person one last bath in the sacred river, and then build a fire to cremate the body. After building a pile of wood about four feet high, they put the dead body on the wood pile, and piled a lot of dried cow dung on the chest of the dead body. Then, the widowed woman, with her head shaved and wearing white clothes, brought fire from a sacred place, put a piece of meat in her husband's mouth, and circled the wood pile five times, then, without any expression, she lit a fire on a pile in front of her husband's chest.

The fire burned quickly. But the widow still used a long bamboo pole to stir it from time to time, calling the fire to burn faster.

After the fire went out, the widow threw all the unburned parts into the river. At the same time, her relatives also brought her to the water's edge and took off all the gold and silver ornaments on her wrists and legs and threw them into the river. Then, she took a clay pot of water from the river, carried it on her shoulder, walked to the ashes of the corpse, and poured it straight down. Then she went straight back, without even turning her head.

### Instant Enlightenment

— Lei Hong

Two brothers committed the crime of stealing sheep and were caught by the victim, who tattooed two letters on their foreheads: ST, meaning "sheep thief."

The older brother could not bear this humiliating symbol and prepared to live in seclusion in a strange place. But people were curious about the letters on his forehead and asked him what they meant. He was so ashamed that he couldn't answer, wandered back and forth, and finally, with the deepest pain, committed suicide and died, buried far away from home.

The younger brother thought, "I can't escape the crime of stealing sheep anyway, I want to live here, regain my reputation, and make my neighbors look up to me." As the years passed, the younger brother actually established his clear reputation.

One day, an outsider saw the letters on the old man's forehead. He asked the local villagers what these letters meant. "That was a long time ago," the villagers said. "I was born too late to know the details of that time, but I think the letters are probably an abbreviation for 'Saint' (Saint)."

### Cilang Island

— Zheng Guoyi

A certain newspaper's supplement contained "Record of Song Gentleman Xie Ao," with thorough and comprehensive textual research, for which I deeply admire it. However, I fear that referring to the gentleman by the name Xie Gaoyu (Ao) is inappropriate; Gaoyu initially followed Wen Tianxiang in his military campaigns, enduring hardship and danger, disregarding death and valuing life, hardly a recluse. Even after the fall of the Song Dynasty, though he hid and fled, the sorrow of a lost homeland, the pain of abandoning the imperial ancestral temple was expressed through mournful cries at the West Terrace. His writings and deeds are enough to change the universe and move ghosts and gods to tears. Even now, a thousand years later, one can still vividly imagine the man, making it impossible to compare him to the Jin recluse Tao Jingjie (Yuanming).

Jingjie briefly served during the late Jin Dynasty and then retired, never emerging again after the dynasty's change. Such a person can rightly be called a recluse. Gaoyu's experiences were incomparable to this. I believe it would be better to call him a "loyalist," which better reflects Gaoyu's original aspirations and preserves his true character. I venture to offer this presumptuous opinion, wondering if it meets with the approval of discerning minds. Gaoyu's tomb is in Guangdong, and his descendants are scattered throughout Chaoyang. These facts are recorded in the county gazetteer, but whether there is any fabrication involved is unknown. I am a native of Chaoyang, and I once spoke with local elders about Xie Gaoyu, but they were mostly bewildered and unaware of the details, vaguely wondering who Xie Gaoyu was. Chaoyang's literary atmosphere has long been poor, and historical traces are generally unknown. Speaking of this, I cannot help but sigh with grief! The attribution of ancient tombs to famous figures is not unique to Xie Gaoyu in Chaozhou; even the tomb of Prime Minister Lu (Xiufu) is subject to doubt. Lu Xiufu, carrying the Song Emperor (　), jumped into the sea, his body lost in the waves. Where could his bones have come from? It is undoubtedly a fabrication by well-intentioned individuals. (Xiufu was from Yancheng, and it is said that Yancheng also has a tomb of Prime Minister Lu, which makes it even more incomprehensible.) Many traces of Lu Xiufu are recorded in the Chaozhou prefectural gazetteer. Besides the tomb, there is Cilang Island, located on an isolated island off the coast of Nan'ao, 120 miles east of Raoping city, also named after Prime Minister Lu. One account says that at the end of the Song Dynasty, the Chaozhou local military commander Zhang Da advocated righteousness and escorted the imperial boat. Zhang Da's wife, Chen Biniang, saw him off here and bid him farewell. The words "farewell" and "serve" are homophones, so it is actually "Cilang Island" and not "Serving Official Island." The prefectural gazetteer records Chen Zhengyan's argument for Serving Official Island, saying: "North of Nan'ao Mountain, at Qingjing Estuary, there is the Prime Minister's tomb. The Prime Minister once served as a vice minister of the Ministry of Rites, so it is fitting that the island is named after the Prime Minister." It also says: "Scholars studying the past should be skeptical and reserve judgment when in doubt. If certainty is unattainable, they should follow the greater principle, to see the unwavering loyalty and dedication of righteous officials, who, when all hope was lost, drove their wives and children into the sea and gave their lives to protect the Emperor. Zhang Da and his wife's farewell at the crossroads is a trivial matter, and the evidence is remote and lacking. The island's name should follow Lu and not Zhang." It also records Zhou Shoxun's argument for Cilang Island, saying: "In Nan'ao, Chaozhou, there is an island called Cilang Island. It is traditionally said that Song Commander Zhang Da escorted the imperial boat to Hongluo Mountain, and his wife, Chen Biniang, saw him off at this island, hence the name. It implies knowing that success was impossible and there would be no return, so it is not called 'sending the husband' but 'bidding farewell to the husband.' The Historical Outline records: Commander Zhang Da launched a night attack on the Yuan army and was defeated. Zhang Da was a real person. It is also traditionally said that Da died in battle at Yaishan, and Biniang sought out his corpse and buried it, dying of starvation. Thus, the husband was loyal and the wife virtuous, parting forever in this place, the island named after the event, the island known through the people. But Chen Zhengyan recklessly changed it to Serving Official Island, attributing it to Lu. Lu retired to Chaozhou when he was a direct scholar of the Bachelor's Academy. He was not known to be a vice minister of the Ministry of Rites, so the place where he lived was called the Scholar's Hall. Why is it now called Serving Official Island instead of Scholar's Island?" It also says: "The position of commander is not low. Ling Zhen was a commander, and the Historical Outline annotates his surrender to the Yuan. Zhang Da was a commander, and it records his night attack on the Yuan army. Zhang Da was an outstanding figure among countless dead soldiers. Why do later generations consider him a commoner?" Such are the differences and similarities in the debate between Serving Official Island and Cilang Island. However, Zhou Shoxun's insight is remarkable. His words, "Knowing that success was impossible and there would be no return, so it is not called 'sending the husband' but 'bidding farewell to the husband,'" and "The husband was loyal and the wife virtuous, parting forever in this place, the island named after the event, the island known through the people," are particularly profound. Regardless of whether Zhang Da's story is a fabrication or not, as described here, it is both sad and heroic, a great subject for poetry. It is a pity that no one has put it into verse for contemporary people to recite. Chen Zhengyan's narrow view that "Zhang Da was an overseas military man, dying in the vanguard, who can also attach himself to the Prime Minister to contend for fame for thousands of years" (from Chen Zhengyan's argument for Serving Official Island) is truly vulgar. "Overseas military men, dying in the vanguard," though different in status from the Prime Minister, share the same dedication to defending the country and resisting foreign invasion. What difference does rank make? Not knowing this makes it difficult to be a scholar. Chaozhou scholars have historically rarely studied historical records, and Chen Zhengyan is a prime example. (Zhengyan was from Raoping, a licentiate through tribute selection in the Qing Dynasty.)

### Carefree Flower

Chapter Eight: Failure at the Last Moment (49)

Zhu Zhai was taken aback when he saw Yun Qing's stern face and heard her words. He laughed and said, "Can't you see my heart? I have nothing to say now, but future actions will prove it." Yun Qing nodded and said, "I'll be watching you." Zhu Zhai said, "I hope you'll be watching me. I'll go back today and negotiate with her." Yun Qing said, "Be careful in everything you do." Zhu Zhai said, "I'll go now. I'll negotiate with her first. If I need you, I'll call you and ask you to come and help." Yun Qing said, "It's better for the two of you to negotiate yourselves; there's no need for me." Zhu Zhai said, "I can't do without you." After saying that, he left in a hurry.

When Zhu Zhai returned home, he saw Feng Sheng still wearing a blue cloth jacket, working in the kitchen. He went straight to the bedroom, sat on a sofa near the bed, and pondered whether he should initiate the conversation or provoke her to do so. While he was thinking, Feng Sheng came in. Zhu Zhai closed his eyes, as if he didn't see her. After Yun Qing left, Feng Sheng became increasingly angry. Seeing Zhu Zhai in the house, ignoring her, she couldn't contain her anger. She stood in front of Zhu Zhai, put her hands on her hips, and loudly asked, "Zhu Zhai! What are you planning? Tell me clearly! I can't stand this ambiguity. I'm a living person, not a ghost. You can't treat me like this." Zhu Zhai was closing his eyes and thinking, and when he heard this, he thought his chance had come. He slightly opened his eyes, glanced at Feng Sheng, and said, "What are you saying? What people, ghosts? I don't understand at all!" Feng Sheng said, "Stop pretending! Speak clearly! What are you scheming? I know all your tricks. You want to cast me aside and not treat me like a person. I won't agree." Zhu Zhai said, "I still don't understand." Feng Sheng said, "You married me as your wife, but you don't treat me like a wife. What does that mean?" Zhu Zhai said, "Are you really the wife I wanted to marry?" Zhu Zhai's words were like a sharp sword, deeply hurting Feng Sheng's heart. In a mixture of anger and resentment, she said with a sob, "If you think I'm not the wife you wanted to marry, then you should divorce me!" Zhu Zhai said, "Divorce! This is your idea, not me forcing you to divorce." Feng Sheng patted her chest and said, "Yes! As long as you agree to my conditions, I'll divorce you." Zhu Zhai said, "If you really have the guts, I'll agree to you." Feng Sheng patted her chest again and said, "What am I afraid of! I'm only afraid you can't meet my conditions." Zhu Zhai said, "Tell me." Feng Sheng put one hand on her hip, raised the other, and gave a thumbs up, saying, "First condition: alimony. All existing housing and everything in it will belong to me, to be disposed of by me, and you must not interfere. You must also give me a considerable amount of living expenses every month. Can you do that?" Zhu Zhai responded softly, "That's acceptable."

### Atomic Warfare

— Weiying

If there were a global atomic war, the world would become a world of insects. There are two reasons: 1. The number of insects is already far greater than the total number of humans; 2. Insects' ability to resist atomic radiation is twenty to forty times higher than that of humans.

Besides insects, the second most dominant species in the world after an atomic war should be rats. Rats' ability to resist the radiation produced by atomic fission is inferior to that of insects, but far stronger than that of humans. Moreover, according to a 1947 report by the U.S. Department of the Interior, even in a country like the United States, which has not experienced war and where the general population pays considerable attention to hygiene, the rat "population" is already equal to the human population.

### Montgomery's Double

— Pingzhai

One day in mid-January 1944, in the dressing room of a famous London theater, the famous actor Clifton James was removing his makeup when someone suddenly knocked on the door. James thought it was probably another fan asking for an autograph and lazily called out, "Come in!"

However, the person who came in was his old friend, the famous movie star David Niven. David was in full military uniform, having already joined the army and become a major in the British Army. During their cheerful conversation, David suddenly asked him if he could take some photos. James naturally agreed. But David had many tricks. He took off his leather military jacket and asked James to wear it, and also gave James his military cap. He also asked him to put his hands in his pockets and puff out his arms. Then, with a flash of bright light, David happily said goodbye.

A week later, James suddenly received an official letter from the British military, asking him to report to Colonel Leicester at the Lister Hotel the next day. James of course obeyed. Colonel Leicester welcomed him warmly, and standing next to Leicester was David Niven, smiling broadly.

Colonel Leicester said, "You probably know that your face looks a lot like General Montgomery?"

A silence followed.

Leicester sized James up and asked, "Are you a patriotic person?"

James said, "Of course!"

"Then please sign here."

James glanced at it briefly and resolutely signed this confidential document.

David Niven said, "James, we want you to play General Montgomery."

James wanted to laugh, but Colonel Leicester and David Niven had suddenly become serious, and James didn't dare to laugh. So Leicester told him that General Montgomery had been appointed by the Allied High Command a month earlier to lead a large army to break through the European fortress. German intelligence agents were closely watching Montgomery's movements, because they could deduce where to strike based on the areas he inspected.

The military's request to James was very simple: starting from that day, he should contact General Montgomery, imitate his voice, actions, and walk, so that even Montgomery's closest friends could not tell the difference between the real and the fake. James thought: This was not an easy task. However, like rehearsing a difficult play, he began to work. He grew a mustache, dyed his hair white, and added "shoulder pads" to his clothes. Every day, he carefully watched how General Montgomery ate, how he washed, how he slept, and what his catchphrases were. General Montgomery himself was as happy as a child, enthusiastically teaching him everything. James liked to eat eggs, but Montgomery never ate eggs, so he had to give them up. His fingers had to be free of any yellow stains, because Montgomery didn't smoke. Montgomery didn't drink alcohol, so James quit drinking.

It wasn't until late May that he "performed."

That morning, he was in full military uniform, with many medals. He publicly boarded a military car, and as the car started, the crowd cheered thunderously! So he waved to the crowd from the car window and sat back comfortably...

The car arrived at the airfield. The airfield staff stood at attention. The plane door opened, and everyone saluted. Leicester guarded him and respectfully said, "Goodbye, General." He then lightly added, "Gibraltar." James carried a briefcase, filled with instructions, telling him who to see and what to say.

When he arrived in Gibraltar, James scanned the airfield with his eagle eyes, got off the plane gracefully, and Gibraltar Governor Sir Evesham hurried forward to greet him. James patted his vest and called him "Old Eve."

He stayed in Gibraltar until dusk, actually convened military meetings, held award ceremonies, and after a busy day, flew to Algiers. There he was again received with great enthusiasm, with the whole city turning out to welcome him. But after he arrived at his "residence," he spent every day hiding in the small building, playing cards with his bodyguard and listening to the radio.

On June 3, he arrived at the airfield again under tight military and police protection. This time it was to Cairo. In Cairo, he played until June 7, the day after the general offensive began. Then his mission was over, and he happily returned to London. Colonel Leicester, as soon as he saw him, gave him a smart salute and then handed him a check, saying, "General, this is your salary—calculated according to the general's salary!"
