### On the Issue of U.S. Aid to China, President Zhang Issues a Special Statement Elaborating on Ten Financial and Economic Reforms

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Zhang Qun, President of the Executive Yuan, recently issued a statement on the Chinese government's position regarding U.S. aid to China. This statement was formally announced by Director Hua Xian'guang at a press conference on the 28th. The statement said: China has experienced more than eight years of long-term resistance against Japan, compounded by the rebellion of the communists, and is therefore encountering unprecedented economic difficulties today. In order to overcome these difficulties, the Chinese government, in view of the long-standing friendship between China and the United States, has requested the U.S. government to grant us economic and technical assistance. The interim aid bill passed by the U.S. Congress has included China, and the U.S. government has also stated that it will propose a practical aid plan for China in the current session of the U.S. Congress. The Chinese government expresses its pleasure at this. The Chinese government is aware that it must have a complete and effective self-help plan, followed or complemented by general administrative and military reforms. The main financial and economic reforms that the Chinese government is preparing to implement are approximately as follows:

Reducing all government expenditures as much as possible â€“ both in terms of legal tender and foreign currency. Improving the national tax, provincial tax, and local tax systems and their administration to achieve the dual goals of increasing revenue and equalizing the burden. To improve the work efficiency of civil servants and officers and soldiers, their treatment will be gradually improved, while a plan for the gradual reduction of personnel will be implemented. The control of daily necessities must be strengthened and the scope expanded to prevent speculation and soaring prices. Making every effort to establish a foundation that will stabilize the currency system so that foreign aid can achieve maximum effectiveness. Improving the banking and credit system, strengthening the regulatory responsibility of the Central Bank, and continuing to promote policies to curb inflation. Encouraging the export of goods and making every effort to remove obstacles to exports. Improving the control of imported goods, and when the environment permits, the control measures containing emergency measures will be adjusted as appropriate. Developing agricultural production, improving the rural economy, and implementing land reform. The suggestions of the Sino-U.S. Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group will be adopted as soon as they can be implemented. Restoring transportation and important industries and mines as much as possible, in order to increase production and reduce excessive reliance on imports of foreign goods. (Editor's note: The above ten key points of reform were published in this newspaper on the 24th)

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] Our embassy in the United States today issued here the ten-point financial and economic reform plan to be implemented by the Chinese government, as announced by President Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan. This statement was issued simultaneously in Nanjing. The publication of this reconstruction plan coincides with the time when our technical delegation is holding talks with U.S. officials here, and it also coincides with the eve of the presentation of the U.S. aid to China plan to Congress.

### Ambassador Ma Received Bei Zuyi Yesterday; The Aid to China Plan is Expected to be Submitted Early Next Month

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] According to sources here: U.S. Secretary of State Marshall received Bei Zuyi, head of our technical delegation to the United States, on the afternoon of the 28th. Mr. Bei was accompanied by Ambassador Gu Weijun. Although external sources stated that they could not disclose the content of the meeting, they were obviously pleased with this encouraging development.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Secretary of State Marshall said last week that he intended to submit the aid to China plan to the National Advisory Committee and the Budget Bureau "within a week." The "one week" mentioned by Marshall will expire on the 29th.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th, United Press] A well-informed source said: President Truman is expected to submit the aid to China plan to Congress in the first half of February. It also said that the State Department has submitted the plan to the Budget Bureau, and then sent it to the National Advisory Committee to complete its preparation work, so as to submit it to the legislative body for discussion. He declined to disclose the total amount of the loan listed in the aid to China plan, but said that it would be more than 300 million U.S. dollars. This amount of 300 million was proposed by Marshall under the urging of Congress before February. He also pointed out that the Budget Bureau should be able to handle the aid to China plan quickly, because it does not involve particularly complicated financial calculations. The National Advisory Committee is a policy institution for such matters, so it is expected that it will also be handled quickly, because the pressure from Congress to submit this plan as soon as possible is increasing day by day. All the above factors are precursors to the early submission of the aid to China plan to Congress. It is heard that some officials are dissatisfied with Marshall's secret policy and his delay in deciding on the aid to China plan. Apart from Zhou Yide and other few who advocate aid to China, there are also some Republicans who share the same views as the above-mentioned officials, such as Senator Bridges, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.

[This newspaper] New York, 28th Broadcasting: Scripps Howard newspapers commented today, urging the United States to speed up aid to China. It said: The sphere of influence of the Chinese Communist Party is expanding day by day, and the future is worrying. The Northeast is the key to the Far East, not only controlling China and Korea, but also the gateway to Siberia and Japan. The outbreak of the First World War was caused by Japan's seizure of the Northeast. From an economic point of view, the Northeast is to Asia as the Ruhr area is to Europe. During the Great War, China restrained millions of Japanese troops and was a loyal ally of the United States. At this critical moment, the United States should provide assistance.

### The Two Cases of Kowloon City and Shamian Must be Resolved in Order; Foreign Minister Wang Reports to the Central Political Committee

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The Shamian incident will be resolved according to international practice after the Kowloon problem is resolved. The government will also study and reply to the protest raised by London regarding the Shamian incident after the Kowloon problem is resolved. This was mentioned by Foreign Minister Wang at the Foreign Affairs report at the Central Political Committee on the 28th.

Shi Zhaoying's Speech

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Regarding Sino-British negotiations, Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a press conference held by the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau on the 28th: The Kowloon City and Shamian incidents in Guangzhou are still under negotiation between the Chinese and British governments, and we hope to reach a reasonable solution that will satisfy both parties. The British Foreign Office's note to Zheng Tianxi, our ambassador to the United Kingdom, on the 24th (the content of which is in another article) clarifies the British view of the Kowloon City incident. Our country has not yet replied to it. A spokesman for the British Embassy also told reporters on the 28th: The negotiations are still in progress, and we hope to resolve them as soon as possible. As for our permission to the British Embassy for compensation for the Shamian incident, he firmly stated that he had indeed obtained a written reply from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but our Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said: When Mr. Reubowski, Counselor of the British Embassy, visited Mr. Yin Baozi, Director of the European Department, Yin handed him a document, which only stated that the destruction of the British Consulate in Shamian, Guangzhou, would be handled in accordance with international practice. This is no different from the position publicly announced by Director Shi Zhaoying of the Information Department on the 21st. However, it seems too hasty to say that this announcement means a specific reply that compensation should be granted. Our side is still waiting for the British government's reply to our protest regarding the Kowloon City incident. As for the Shamian incident in Guangzhou, our side still needs to wait for a detailed investigation to be completed before a specific decision can be made.

### Dong Xian'guang Corrects a Thames Newspaper Editorial

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Director Dong Xian'guang said at a press conference on the 28th: An editorial in the London Times on January 24 stated that "The Chinese authorities seem to have realized that the anti-British movement incited by some Chinese newspapers is endangering Sino-British relations, so they have banned the publication of news about the Shamian incident, except for those issued by government agencies." This statement completely distorts the relationship between the Chinese government and the press and must be corrected to set things right. I can responsibly state that no government agency has ever "banned the publication of news about the Shamian incident." Constitutional government has been implemented, and there is absolutely no possibility of "banning publication." I am in charge of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau. Hearing these words, I will take the "government agencies" mentioned by the newspaper to refer to me as the one who is ordered to release news about the Shamian incident. I am very surprised by what the Thames newspaper editorial said. I am eager to know who issued this instruction and on what authority the issuer based it.

### The Investigation of the Shamian Case is Over; Pan Hankui Returns to Nanjing to Report

[This newspaper, Guangzhou, 28th] Mr. Pan Hankui, who was responsible for investigating the Shamian incident in Guangzhou, delayed his work and only flew back to Nanjing on the 28th to report.

[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] According to reports, the British government has agreed to release the detained Chinese in Kowloon City and promised not to make arrests during the talks, but this has been denied by the British Embassy.

### The British Released a Note to Us Regarding the Kowloon City Incident

Hope that Jurisdiction and Eviction Issues Can Be Handled Separately

[Reuters, London, 27th] The British Foreign Office officially released the content of the note sent to Dr. Zheng Tianxi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, on the 24th regarding the Kowloon City incident, expressing the British government's sincere hope that the issue of jurisdiction over Kowloon City can be handled separately from the recent issue of ordering residents "occupying" the area to relocate. The British government deeply regrets that riots caused by the eviction occurred while negotiations on the future status of Kowloon were still in progress. The British government believes that the aforementioned negotiations are still in progress, and the government hopes to be able to present its views to the Chinese government soon. The British government's note also pointed out that it would be a major mistake if the Hong Kong government could not take administrative measures for the welfare of the Kowloon area because the issue of jurisdiction over Kowloon City was still under discussion. The note reviewed the eviction of residents from the old urban area and the actions of the Hong Kong police on January 5, and also criticized Chinese newspapers for systematically inciting anti-British movements for several weeks. For example, the Hong Kong National Daily published exaggerated and distorted reports. Furthermore, the speech delivered by Magistrate An to the residents of Kowloon City under the Chinese flag after the Hong Kong side implemented the eviction order for the first time was also a provocative act, and Chinese newspapers recognized this action as reaffirming China's sovereignty. The British government believes that the Hong Kong government has sufficient reasons to decide to clear the occupied area and believes that the Hong Kong government has given thorough consideration to the "occupying" residents. The British government further believes that if the entire course of events can be made public to the Chinese people in an appropriate manner, the entire issue will inevitably be observed in a calmer and more objective spirit. Therefore, the note finally emphasized the appropriateness of making all the facts public to the Chinese people. The note did not mention the Guangzhou incident. Britain recently sent a note to China requesting compensation for the losses suffered by British property in Guangzhou during the anti-British movement. The note subsequently submitted by the Chinese government did not mention the British side's request, but only requested compensation for the losses in the Kowloon City incident.

### Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman's Views on the British Note

Stated the Reasons for the Kowloon City Incident

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Central News Agency reporter recently asked Director Shi Zhaoying of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for his views on the note from British Foreign Secretary Bevin to Ambassador Zheng Tianxi. According to reports: Our people are indeed very willing to learn more about the British official's views on the Kowloon City incident, but the Chinese people will definitely remember that our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its representatives in Hong Kong seriously advised the Hong Kong government before January 5 that it should not take coercive measures in areas where our country has never abandoned its sovereignty, and reiterated this serious advice repeatedly before January 12. The Hong Kong government's failure to give appropriate consideration to the above advice is the main reason for the unfortunate incident of shooting and tear gas on January 12.

### Listed Companies' Stock Certificates Must Be Reissued with New Stocks by a Deadline; The Shanghai Stock Exchange's Application for Extension is Rejected

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The Shanghai Stock Exchange's application to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to extend the "Measures for the Transfer of Company Stocks" listed on the market until the end of March of the 37th year has been decided not to be extended after consultation between the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance and the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The Shanghai Stock Exchange has been instructed to implement six measures, which are as follows: Those who have been approved by the company law to increase capital, change registration, and obtain a license, but have not printed new stocks, or the stocks are being reissued and have not been fully completed, are allowed to be listed temporarily with stock certificates, but are still limited to reissuing new stocks uniformly before the middle of March of this year, and new stocks will be listed from March 16. From the date of receipt of the document, those who have applied to the local competent authorities for approval of registration changes regarding the increase of capital must submit the application documents to the Shanghai Stock Exchange for verification, and they are allowed to be listed temporarily with stock certificates in accordance with the previous provisions, and they should still reissue new stocks for listing within one month after the approval of the registration change. Those who have formulated a stock value increase plan in accordance with the method of re-determining the value of fixed assets in the industrial and mining transportation industry and submitted it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval, and hold the approval documents, but have not applied for registration changes, are temporarily allowed to list and trade receipts or other certificates according to the number of increased stocks, but are limited to applying to the local competent authorities for registration changes within half a month from the date of receipt of the document, and submitting the application documents to the Shanghai Stock Exchange for verification, they are still allowed to be listed temporarily. Those who have been approved for registration changes should reissue new stocks for listing within one month after the approval of registration in accordance with the provisions of the second item. Those who have not applied for capital increase registration in accordance with the Company Law, or have not submitted an application for valuation and capital increase in accordance with the method of re-evaluating the value of fixed assets in the industrial and mining transportation industry, will all be temporarily listed according to the original number of stocks before the capital increase, and new stocks will still be reissued for listing within one month after the approval of registration. Those who have not processed the registration changes in accordance with the handling measures for the registration of various companies in the recovered area will all be temporarily suspended from listing. From the date of receipt of the document, those who newly report to the Shanghai Stock Exchange for capital increase or valuation and capital increase in accordance with the method of re-evaluating the value of fixed assets in the industrial and mining transportation industry shall not list the stocks after the capital increase until they have been approved for registration changes and reissued new stocks. The instructions were issued on the 28th.

### The United States Reveals Its Intention to Delay the Opening of the Peace Conference

[United Press, Washington, 27th] Informed sources said on the 27th that the United States has "de facto abandoned" its intention to urge the early convening of the peace conference with Japan. On the contrary, the United States will increase its efforts to assist Japan's economic recovery under occupation and can wait for a more appropriate time to devote itself to the Japanese peace conference. It is said that no firm decision has been made on this matter. According to recent discussions by U.S. officials, it is believed that they will choose one of two paths: (Continued on page 2, column 1)

### We Are Studying the U.S. Plan to Rehabilitate Japan by Experts

Director Dong Answers Reporters' Questions

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] At the Executive Yuan's press conference, someone asked Director Dong Xian'guang that according to Shanghai news, our side believes that the plan proposed by the U.S. representative on the Far Eastern Commission to rehabilitate Japan is unsatisfactory and may express something. I wonder what Director Dong's opinion is? Dong replied that this matter is still waiting for experts to study, and I have no opinion. Secondly, a reporter raised a diplomatic question, that is, it is heard that our merchants on the French-Vietnamese border have been robbed of mules and horses by the French. What countermeasures will our government take? Director Shi of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that wars cannot occur where there is a war, but the countermeasures to be taken will only be decided after the facts have been ascertained.

### Supervision Committee Proposes Improving the Treatment of Public Education Personnel, Which Will Be Submitted to the President and Then to the National Government

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The Supervision Yuan passed the proposal to improve the treatment of public education personnel at a discussion meeting on the 26th. It has been drafted and submitted by 19 members of the committee, including Miao Peicheng and Yu Shude, to President Yu Youren on the 28th, who will then submit it to the National Government. The full text of the proposal is as follows:

"For the matter of the proposal: This adjustment of the treatment of public education personnel is based on the cost of living index and is issued every three months. Regarding the allocation of in-kind goods, in addition to the allocation of two dou of rice per person per month, items such as oil, coal, cloth, sugar, and salt are all cancelled. It is found that the Legislative Yuan, the Political Participation Council, and our Yuan previously proposed to improve the treatment of public education personnel, and it was proposed that adjustments be made monthly according to the cost of living index, and that the original in-kind goods should still be allocated. At present, commodity prices fluctuate sharply, and the index is soaring from time to time. Adjustments are made once every three months, which is very different from the cost of living index. For public education personnel with a base salary of 100 yuan, the salary and allowances in December of last year were 1.39 million yuan (990,000 yuan for living allowances, plus 400,000 yuan for the multiplier), and the difference between in-kind goods and market prices was about 1.4 million yuan (870,000 yuan for two bags of flour, 70,000 yuan for three catties of cooking oil, more than 200,000 yuan for two loads of coal balls, more than 30,000 yuan for two catties of sugar, 20,000 yuan for four catties of salt, and about 200,000 yuan for cloth), totaling about 2.8 million yuan (excluding the surplus of living allowances). If we calculate according to the new adjustment method in February of this year, the salary and allowances and rice price will only be more than 3.5 million yuan (2.55 million yuan calculated according to the basic cost of living index of 30 yuan, 595,000 yuan for one-tenth of the 70 yuan index, and about 360,000 yuan for three dou of rice). Compared with the two months, February only increased by more than 700,000 yuan, but the commodity prices in February were several times higher than those in December of last year, so this adjustment not only did not increase the benefits of public education personnel, but also reduced them, making life even more difficult. The government's allocation of in-kind goods to public education personnel in major cities was originally to stabilize commodity prices and control the market. Once the existing allocation is cancelled, it will cause a large number of consumers to compete for materials in the market, driving up commodity prices, which is inevitable. This method actually runs counter to the economic emergency measures program and loses the original intention of adjusting treatment. The members of the committee are aware of this, and in order to stabilize the lives of public education personnel, that is, to stabilize politics, it is proposed to restore the original allocation method, or adjust the treatment of public education personnel monthly according to the cost of living index from February to make up for it. Is it appropriate? I respectfully request you to review and submit it (title omitted)."

### Business Profit Tax: Collection Method Prepared; Ministry of Finance to Officially Announce and Implement Soon

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] Regarding the 1948 Business Profit Tax collection method, the Ministry of Finance, based on the principles passed by the Executive Yuan, has prepared detailed measures, totaling fourteen articles. It was reported at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 27th and will be announced and implemented soon.

The estimated payment will be adjusted with refunds or additional payments after the official tax amount is calculated and determined in the future. Any overpaid amount will be given statutory interest. The standard for the estimated payment will be based on a comparison of the tax revenue budgets for 1948 and 1947, the increase in business profits, and the price increases between 1948 and 1947. The estimated payment will be temporarily set at six times the previous year's tax amount. Newly established businesses in 1947 and businesses established before the end of 1946 that have not yet paid taxes will be required to pay 12.6% of their capital. Local tax authorities will begin filling out tax bills from February 15th and must complete the delivery to taxpayers within one month. Taxpayers must pay the tax within twenty days of receiving the tax notice. It is understood that the Ministry of Finance will officially announce and implement these measures soon.

Finance Minister Yu Hongjun will also make a statement when the measures are announced to provide explanations. According to estimates from relevant parties, after the estimated payment method for the 1948 Business Profit Tax is adopted, this tax revenue could reach over 40 trillion yuan before April of this year.

The so-called fixed-order loan method is an important part of the economic reform plan. This newspaper has previously published articles separately pointing out its effects and gains and losses. Although all loans are currently suspended, the various implementation methods recently announced have not deleted these loan methods. Furthermore, given the urgent appeals from the Northern Petition Delegation and the unanimous demands from industrial and commercial circles across the country, the authorities are reconsidering industrial loans, and the general trend seems to be that there is a possibility of selectively opening them up through this method. If the comprehensive allocation method is fully implemented, controlling materials will become an important condition for allocation, and the use of fixed orders to replace procurement will inevitably increase.

However, the views of the authorities and the industrial and commercial circles on this issue do not seem to be the same. The authorities emphasize controlling materials, and financial turnover seems to be secondary. The focus of the industrial and commercial circles is on financial accommodation, and whether they are willing to easily give up their materials is still a question. The reason is very simple. In this era of rising prices, when hoarding is the most profitable, who would be willing to sell as soon as they produce and miss the sure profits in front of them? Engaging in industry is currently the most difficult, so who would be willing to throw out fixed orders as much as possible just to obtain a loan and only earn some superficially legal profits? Moreover, according to past examples of official price purchases and the price limits set by the government, they are often too harsh and unreasonable, causing producers to hesitate. Various exceptional expenses and apportionments, the difficulty of replenishing raw materials, the difficulty of replenishing machinery, and the future cost calculation after wages are calculated according to the index and donations and taxes and power are adjusted at any time are extremely difficult, and generally, they will inevitably increase day by day. Under these extraordinary circumstances, unless it is absolutely necessary to drink poison to quench thirst and temporarily relieve the immediate crisis, they will probably not enthusiastically respond to the fixed-order loans as the authorities expect.

Of course, this type of loan is not mandatory. The government is tightening monetary policy and contracting currency to curb inflation. If manufacturers are unwilling to take out loans and find their own solutions, isn't that what the authorities would be happy to hear? However, the difficulty of financing affects current production and severely impacts future development. This seems very noteworthy from the perspective of the overall national economy. Currently, fixed-order loans have not yet been implemented, and only a guideline for contract spinning, weaving, unified purchase and sale has been set forth in the control plan for cotton yarn and cloth. However, because of this, many in the textile industry are already preparing to tighten their belts as much as possible. This is a useful reference for the progress of fixed-order loans.

Even if manufacturers are happy to accept it and this loan method can be successfully launched, we must also have considerable reservations about its scope and effectiveness. Because government fixed orders are mainly used for allocation, followed by military and public use. As for what to do with the huge amounts of goods ordered beyond military, public, and allocation purposes, it is necessary to consider this first. If they are sold as they are produced and supplied to the market, it is similar to state-run commerce. Except for essential necessities for people's livelihood, this policy has not been established in various economic plans and measures. If they are temporarily stored and sold at a higher price, how can this be reconciled with the regulations prohibiting hoarding and profiteering? The most ideal way, of course, is to regulate the supply and demand and transport large quantities of products produced locally to other places. However, based on the precedents of the transportation of yarn, cloth, grain, coal, and raw silk, it is difficult to believe that the current material agencies have this sufficient capacity. Isn't the purchase of cotton still entrusted to others? And isn't the coal stacked in the preparation area unable to be transported to major cities for use? Based on this reasoning, the so-called fixed-order loans are likely to narrow the scope and designate certain goods, such as daily necessities, to handle, and it is also possible to designate certain areas, such as Shanghai, to try out. This reduces the burden on the organizer and makes it easier to gather things, and it can also greatly help in terms of allocation. However, this local plan is only for the organizer and does not take into account the government's important mission of helping industry and commerce increase production, nor does it take into account the widespread aspirations of industrial and commercial circles in various places.

Originally, the promotion of loans, regardless of what method is adopted, its other meaning is to increase issuance and inflate currency, thereby stimulating prices and endangering people's livelihood. Therefore, after deep reflection, it is necessary to adopt the so-called "financial cutoff" policy to correct the current situation. This was originally a last resort. However, under other loan methods, the objects and amounts of the loans can still be selected by the national banks, and the initiative is completely in the hands of the national banks, whether to lend or not, or how much to lend. If fixed-order loans are implemented, then in theory, anyone who meets these conditions should be treated equally, regardless of closeness or distance; moreover, the amount of the loan should be based on the amount of production and fixed orders, and should not be arbitrarily reduced or freely approved. Otherwise, the policy of fixed-order loans cannot be fully implemented. Therefore, whether national banks have such a large amount of money to deal with this matter, or in other words, whether it is possible to expand issuance to bear this loan, this question is very important. We believe that it is inappropriate to provide fixed-order loans for the production of a certain factory and refuse it for other factories producing the same product; it is also unreasonable to provide fixed-order loans for a part of a certain factory's products and refuse it for the same products from the same factory; it is even more unreasonable to provide fixed-order loans for a factory's products in Area A and refuse it for the same products from factories in Area B, C, etc. In the past, various loans were often criticized for favoring certain classes, and the reason was the uneven treatment. If fixed-order loans are still not implemented in a universal and uniform way, then it is better to conduct thorough research before announcing and implementing them to achieve the most appropriate compromise and facilitate implementation, rather than encountering various difficulties after implementation, and then trying to fix them piecemeal, creating many biased and uneven phenomena. Therefore, although the timing for this loan method is gradually maturing and it seems that the arrow is already on the string and must be fired, we are anxiously overthinking and hope that everyone will reconsider it carefully. Of course, we are not opposed to opening up loans, nor are we absolutely opposed to this loan method. We would rather say that we support considerable loans, but we do not want to see the shortcomings of past loans still remain in the future.

### U.S. Intentions on the Peace Conference

[Continued from Page 1] Continue to exert pressure to convene the peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, and adopt a compromise attitude towards China and the Soviet Union, which insist on retaining the veto power in the peace conference. It is admitted that the differences between China, the Soviet Union, and the United States and Britain cannot be reconciled at present, and this matter should be abandoned until future developments change the situation and make a compromise solution possible. These officials understand that the reason why China does not agree to participate in a peace conference without veto power is that it fears that the United States will take an excessively lenient attitude towards Japan's industrial level. If China does not have veto power, it will not be able to do anything about it. However, they said that there are two points on the industrial level on which they cannot agree with China: The level set by China is not enough to make Japan self-sufficient and must seek foreign assistance. The United States must provide assistance at that time, and the government fears that taxpayers will rise up in opposition one day. For these two reasons, the United States has decided to temporarily shelve its hope of convening the peace conference as soon as possible to seek coordination.

### Tibetan Business Delegation Arrives in Shanghai

(Continued from Page 1)

More than a month in India

The delegation members are all influential figures in Tibetan politics and business circles. The head of the delegation, Xia Guoba, is currently the General Manager of the Lhasa Silver Bureau. They left Tibet for India two months ago and stayed in India for more than a month, visiting various commercial situations. It is reported that in the past, there were very few commercial transactions between Tibet and India. Only a small amount of cloth and iron were imported from India each year, and Tibetan specialties such as wool, leather, and medicinal materials were only exported to India and then re-exported to the United States and Britain. Therefore, in addition to visiting, they did not conduct any commercial contacts in India.

Head of Delegation's Speech

According to Xia Guoba, in the past, the routes for trading goods between Tibet and the outside world were mainly four: through Yunnan, through Kangding, through Qinghai, and waterways mainly through India. In the past, there were no accurate statistics, so the quantity of goods traded could not be investigated. The main task of this delegation's visit to the mainland is to study in detail where it is most cost-effective to purchase the goods needed by Tibetans and where the most convenient transportation route is, in order to formulate plans after returning to Tibet for formal and large-scale trade with the mainland. It is reported that the most urgently needed goods for Tibetans are tea, silk, and porcelain.

Current Situation in Tibet

The Tibetan local government is currently headed by the 13-year-old Dalai Lama, while the Regent Da Zhazha handles all religious and political duties. Under the Regent Da Zhazha, there are the "Kashag" and forty "Kalons" (both political institutions), which are responsible for various departments. There is currently no machine industry in the area, only handicraft industries such as weaving wool. The "Pulu" (material name, similar to broadcloth), woven from wool, is the clothing material worn by Tibetans all year round. In addition to ordinary residents, monks wear pure red "Pulu," which is brightly colored and highly representative of the Tibetan religion. Tibetans still wear long robes, and since there are no motor vehicles, horses are used as transportation.

Departure to Nanjing Soon

The delegation members wore Tibetan clothing on their way from India to Hong Kong, but later changed into Western clothing in Hong Kong due to being noticed and surrounded by residents, which made it inconvenient to move around.

The delegation brought letters from the Dalai Lama and the Regent Da Zhazha to the Chairman, as well as several Tibetan specialties. They plan to stay in Shanghai for two days and then go to Nanjing to meet with the Chairman and present the letters. At the same time, they will also visit Committee Member Xu of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and relevant ministries to discuss future methods of trading goods between Tibet and the mainland. If time permits, they also plan to visit Beijing for inspection.

Today, the municipal government will arrange an itinerary for them to visit major factories in the city, and Secretary-General Shen will jointly host a banquet with various sectors this afternoon to warmly welcome them.

### First Batch of Japanese Reparations Machines: Over 2,000 Total Value Allocated to Private Sector

Application Deadline Set for Mid-March

[Our Nanjing Bureau, 28th] According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs: A total of 9,447 machine tools from Japan's reparations to China, of which 2,362 have been allocated to the Ministry for distribution to private sector businesses. These machine tools include 20 boring machines, 181 iron beds, 13 gear cutting machines, 163 grinders, 1,307 lathes, 256 milling machines, 19 gantry planers, 183 shapers and other, 12 bending machines, 2 hydraulic presses, 32 mechanical presses, 131 hand presses, 17 shears and punching machines, 24 metalworking machines, and 2 wire forming machines. It is reported that the various machine tools have been successively shipped from Japan. The Ministry has ordered the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office to receive and store them, and in accordance with the Executive Yuan's order, representatives from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and national people's industrial and commercial groups will jointly form an evaluation committee to accurately assess the value to facilitate the price allocation. The scope of the price allocation for this batch will focus on developing the textile industry, followed by the paper industry, electrical industry, and coal mines. Industries that manufacture or repair textile, paper, and electrical machinery, and coal mines that increase coal production can apply for price allocation. Other industries will be allocated later, after the second batch of machine tools is drawn. It is also reported that the main condition for this batch of machine tools is the ability to use them most quickly. Remote areas with inconvenient transportation, or areas still in the pacification zone, that are difficult to transport to, difficult to utilize in the short term, or areas that have suffered war losses and have no urgent need will be allocated later. As for the application procedures for price allocation, the application form and factory construction plan form issued by the Executive Yuan must be filled out in triplicate and submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. After the Ministry reviews and forwards them to the Compensation Committee of the Executive Yuan for approval, a contract can be signed, the price paid, and the purchased machine tools can be collected for installation and construction. The application deadline is from the date of the announcement until March 15th of this year. The machine tool list and application procedures can be obtained for 100,000 yuan from the Ministry of Economic Affairs or the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Offices in Shanghai, Hankou, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Tianjin.

### U.S. Relief Supplies for China: Import Duty Exemption

Two Ships of Supplies Arriving in Shanghai Soon

[Our Report] Chen Guangyuan, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling U.S. Relief Supplies, recently went to Nanjing to request the central government to exempt U.S. aid to China relief supplies from customs duties.

If the first batch is handled well, then a second batch can be requested from the U.S. government.

According to Director Chen's report to reporters, the association strives for speed in handling relief supplies. This time, the two ships "California" and "Labartia" transported flour to China. The U.S. shipping company planned to complete unloading in ten days, but the association accelerated its work and completed unloading in eight days, thus receiving a bonus of approximately US$3,000 from the two shipping companies. On the 30th of this month, two more ships of relief supplies will arrive here.

### Press Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense Announces One-Week War Situation: Brilliant Achievements of National Army in Northeast China

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The Press Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense announced the one-week war situation from January 21st to 28th on the 28th. The full text is as follows:

Situation: Since the Communist troops on various battlefields suffered heavy blows from the National Army in the previous two weeks, most of them have been resisting stubbornly this week, except for a few who attempted to use offense as defense. Therefore, the various battlefields seem to be temporarily silent with the wind, snow, and severe cold. However, our heroic National Army is still continuously striking at the remaining bandits.

In the Northeast, the entire 2nd and 7th Columns and part of the 8th Column of the Communist troops, along with the main force of the artillery brigade, totaling more than 60,000 men, attacked Xinlitun. From the 20th to the present, more than half of the Communist troops have been killed or wounded, but they still cannot cross the Lei Chi pool, creating brilliant achievements for the National Army. To cooperate with the victory at Xinlitun, the National Army also took mobile sweeps in various places. On the 18th, the National Army annihilated the remaining bandits of the 8th Column in the northwestern part of Liaobei. On the 24th, a strong force of the National Army in Liaobei recovered Dong, Xi, and Yongji in one fell swoop. The National Army also launched sweeps and recovered Huapichang and many other important strongholds on the 20th.

In North China, Nie Rongzhen's Communist troops have been scattered since their disastrous defeat on the outskirts of Baoding. The remnants of its 5th and 7th Columns fled to the mountains west of Mancheng, while its 1st Column fled to Zhaizhang. They suffered heavy casualties after being bombed by our air force on the way. On the 24th, they fled to the mountains northwest of Zhangfang. The remnants of the 4th Column fled east from Wangdu. On the 24th, the main force fled to Renqiu. There are currently no bandit traces on either side of the Pingbao Road.

In the Su Lu Yu Wan area, Chen Yi's Communist troops have been repeatedly suppressed by the National Army over the past week and are in a passive position everywhere. They are now cut into two sections by the National Army. The remnants of its 10th and 11th Columns were annihilated between Cao County and Chengwu, while the remnants of the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 8th Columns are forced to the area between Xuchang and Xiangcheng, where the National Army is encircling and annihilating them from all sides.

In the Yu E Wan area, Liu's Communist troops have done everything possible to change their tactics in order to avoid the National Army's search and suppression over the past week. However, the National Army, in close cooperation with local teams, is encircling and suppressing them from all sides. In addition, the bandits have not yet been fully clothed in cotton clothes and are suffering from cold and hunger, with more than half of them dead. The bandits in the mountainous areas are now at the end of their rope. On the 23rd, its 12th Column raided the vicinity of Tang County town to plunder food and clothing for warmth. They were encircled and suppressed by the National Army in separate routes. On the 26th, they fled back to the vicinity of the Dabie Mountains. Its 10th Column and Chen Geng's Communist troops have been repeatedly encircled and annihilated by local teams and the National Army in the southeast of Deng County and the Manchuanguan area of Zhechuan. They have been routed and are now fleeing to the areas between Yunxi Yun County and Deng County Xinye. Part of the 9th Column fled to the vicinity of Shahe Town in an attempt to escape annihilation. However, our teams are assisting the National Army to step up the search and suppression, striving to thoroughly eliminate them before stopping.

Results: In the Northeast battlefield this week, more than 22,000 bandits were killed or wounded, more than 550 bandits were captured, and 3 82mm mortars, more than 30 light and heavy machine guns, more than 330 rifles, 37 grenade launchers, and 60,000 rounds of various gun and artillery shells were seized.

In the North China battlefield, more than 5,000 bandits were killed or wounded, 77 bandits were captured, and 107 rifles and 3 pistols were seized this week.

In the Su Lu Yu Wan area, more than 11,000 bandits were killed or wounded, more than 700 bandits were captured, and 5 heavy machine guns, 13 light machine guns, 93 rifles, more than 140 hand grenades, and 19,300 rounds of rifle ammunition were seized this week. (The above figures are based on statistics reported from various sources and do not include the figures from the Pu Shaan area).

### National Public Opposes New Anglo-Iraqi Treaty; Iraqi Cabinet Resigns En Masse; British Anti-Communist Plan in the Middle East Suffers Setback

[Reuters, Baghdad, 27th] The Iraqi government, led by Prime Minister Jabir, has announced its resignation. Jabir flew to Baghdad from Britain 36 hours before the cabinet's resignation. Protests against the new Anglo-Iraqi treaty have intensified. Demonstrations on the streets of Baghdad even involved the use of machine guns, resulting in several deaths and injuries. Under these circumstances, Jabir, who signed the new Anglo-Iraqi treaty in London, had no choice but to announce his resignation. After the cabinet's resignation, the Iraqi Regent broadcast to the nation, calling for cooperation to avoid bloodshed. Upon hearing the news of the government's resignation, many people cheered and danced wildly in the streets. The Speaker of the Iraqi Lower House and 30 members of parliament also resigned at the same time.

[Reuters, London, 27th] There is no hiding the serious concern here regarding the forced resignation of the Iraqi government. Diplomatic circles also expect that the Anglo-Iraqi treaty, signed on January 15th but not yet ratified, may be renegotiated. The British government's position is that until the new treaty is ratified, relations between Britain and Iraq will continue to be governed by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1935. The treaty was originally scheduled to expire in 1952 and will remain in effect unless modified by mutual agreement.

[Associated Press, London, 27th] Government officials declared today that the Iraqi cabinet's resignation is a major blow to Britain's plan to prevent communism in the Middle East. The cabinet's resignation and the Baghdad riots indicate that Prime Minister Jabir's attempt to promote the ratification of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Friendship and Military Assistance has ended. Officials expressed deep disappointment upon receiving the news. Foreign Secretary Bevin once called the treaty a "template" that he hoped to use to gradually sign alliances with Middle Eastern countries, thereby establishing a joint British-Arab security system. British representatives are expected to continue to work behind the scenes in Iraq to support the new Prime Minister in winning public acceptance of the treaty. Foreign officials are currently in London discussing the signing of a similar treaty, and Saudi Arabian officials have also agreed to begin negotiations here at the end of this month. In addition, Britain hopes to reopen negotiations with Egypt on the long-stalled treaty revisions.

[Associated Press, London, 27th] Government sources claimed today that Foreign Secretary Bevin has begun negotiations with Arab leaders on Middle Eastern issues in order to negotiate a joint anti-communist security plan with Arab countries, which is expected to eventually involve the military strategies of both Britain and the United States. Bevin is more concerned about Soviet ambitions in the Middle East than the Palestinian-Jewish conflict. Bevin intends to create a bulwark to prevent Greek guerrillas from threatening the British and American dominance of the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean once they win. This is part of a joint plan by the British Foreign Office and the US State Department.

### Parliamentary Debate on Currency Devaluation; Premier Appeals with Resignation Threat; Technical Amendments Made to Free Gold Trading Bill

[Our dispatch] London, 28th Broadcast: Paris dispatch, the Socialist Party decided to abstain from voting on the issue of the French franc devaluation in the National Assembly, its intention is obviously to avoid the collapse of the Schuman Cabinet.

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] A Socialist Party spokesman said that Prime Minister Schuman has agreed to make some technical amendments to the bill to establish a free gold market in order to allow Parliament to pass it.

[Reuters, Paris, 27th] Prime Minister Schuman warned the National Assembly today that if the Assembly rejects the government's bill to establish a free gold market, the government will not be able to continue governing.

Before the National Assembly began debating the bill, the cabinet held a meeting for two hours and forty-five minutes to discuss the opposition to the bill from some members of the Party. The Socialist Party's decision to oppose the bill was made at a meeting of its members of parliament. At the same time, the Finance Committee of the National Assembly rejected the bill by a vote of seventeen to fifteen, with seven abstentions. The debate in the National Assembly was originally scheduled to begin at 2:00 p.m., but was delayed until 10:00 p.m. because the cabinet meeting had not yet ended. The government motion to treat the bill as an emergency bill was passed by the National Assembly by a vote of 373 to 184, with all those opposed being Communist Party members. After one hour of debate, it was announced at 10:00 p.m. (7:00 a.m. Shanghai time on Wednesday) that the debate would be adjourned until 4:00 p.m. the following day. It is understood that the cabinet has scheduled a meeting for Wednesday morning, to be presided over by President Auriol, while the Socialist Party's parliamentary group has also scheduled another meeting for Wednesday morning, to be attended by Finance Minister Mayer and Foreign Minister Bidault. According to informed sources, the government's bill to establish a free gold market is expected to pass in the National Assembly, as the opposition of Socialist Party members is gradually subsiding. It is not yet known whether the government will make any amendments to accommodate the demands of Socialist Party officials. Before the debate begins on Wednesday, Prime Minister Schuman will address Socialist, Republican, and Radical Party members separately, explaining the significance of the government's bill.

### Next UN General Assembly to Be Held in Paris

### UN Commission on Korea Awaits Soviet Response

Koreans Present Opinions on Elections

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 28th] The United Nations Commission on Korea decided today to extend the date of the general meeting to this Friday, hoping to receive a satisfactory response from the Soviet Union allowing the Commission to enter North Korea.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 27th] Yan Luyi, a representative of the South Korean Democratic Council, issued a statement today calling on the United Nations to recognize the upcoming elections in South Korea as a nationwide vote. He pointed out that the Koreans participating in this vote will account for at least two-thirds of the total population. After Korea becomes a member of the United Nations, the Korean people, with the support of the United Nations, can directly negotiate with the Soviet Union to seek national unification and liberation. Yan emphasized that the unification of Korea is not hopeless and its success depends on the rapid establishment of a Korean Republic in the mountains. It is expected that Koreans under Soviet rule will embrace their own government and will not support a foreign puppet government. The establishment of the Korean Republic can make the Soviet Union realize that handing over North Korea can establish peaceful relations with a truly democratic country.

### French Memorandum on German Western Unification Issue

Saar Coal Production to Be Wholly Controlled by France

[Reuters, London, 27th] French Ambassador to Britain Massigli submitted a memorandum to the British Foreign Office on Saturday, detailing the French government's views on the new economic and administrative measures in the British and American zones of Germany. Authoritative sources say that after the British Foreign Office studies the memorandum, they hope that the final plan for the new measures in the merged zone will be in line with French expectations. At the same time, the premiers of the merged zone are also scheduled to submit suggestions regarding the new measures to the British and American Commanders-in-Chief Robertson and Clay tomorrow.

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] It is reported that Britain and the United States have suggested to the European Coal Organization that coal production in the Saar region be gradually transferred to France. The Saar's annual coal production is 12 million tons. From the second quarter of 1949, all coal production will be transferred to France and will no longer be supplied to Germany. Officials believe that this is in fact recognizing French control over the Saar. The Soviet Union has previously refused to recognize this point.

### Churchill Strongly Advocates Convening a Three-Power Summit to Seek Understanding and Safeguard World Peace

[United Press London, 27th] According to sources close to Churchill, he hopes to convene a round-table conference of the three major powers to reach a practical agreement among the world's major powers, to establish an understanding with the Soviet Union, and to "guarantee peace to the world." It is said that Churchill's speech in the House of Commons on the 23rd, requesting a "showdown" with the Soviet Union, actually called for another three-power summit (i.e., a meeting of Stalin, Truman, and Attlee). It is revealed that after his speech, Churchill told Conservative Party members that what he truly wanted was a round-table conference to bargain with Stalin. Furthermore, Churchill also hopes to obtain a decisive "yes or no" answer from Stalin regarding: Whether the Soviet Union's satellite states intend to cease their aid to Greek guerrillas and stop stirring up unrest along the Greek border. A firm guarantee that the Cominform will not expand beyond the "legitimate" scope of communist influence in Eastern Europe. A frank understanding with Stalin, with both East and West making straightforward declarations regarding the framework for lasting world peace they are willing to allow. If these three guarantees cannot be obtained from Stalin, Churchill believes that "some step" (unspecified) should be taken.

### The Biggest Obstacle to the Austrian Peace Treaty May Be Eliminated; Four Powers to Reopen Negotiations; Soviet Counter-Proposal of Four Points Still Requires Compromise

[Agence France-Presse Washington, 27th] A State Department spokesman declared that the State Department is currently studying the Soviet Union's new proposals for the Austrian peace treaty, and the U.S. government will notify the three major powers within a few days to convene a new meeting of the four-power representatives to discuss these proposals.

[Reuters Vienna, 27th] Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber and Vice-Foreign Minister Walter Renner will travel to London within days to attend the talks on the Austrian peace treaty. The Austrian government also announced that it has received the Soviet Union's counter-proposal to the Austrian treaty and has reviewed it. Austrian Chancellor Figl expressed hope that the Austrian treaty could be quickly concluded to restore Austria's freedom.

[Reuters Vienna, 27th] Although Western Allied sources believe that the recent Soviet proposals regarding German assets in Austria represent progress toward the completion of the Austrian treaty, there are still four points that make their proposals unlikely to be accepted by the Western Allies. The Soviet Union originally demanded 800 million dollars in German asset rights, which has now been reduced to 352 million dollars, including: Oil rights valued at an estimated 135 million dollarsâ€”two-thirds of the rights to Austrian oil exploration, refining, and prospecting, valid for 50 years. Navigation rights valued at approximately 17 million dollars, including 25 percent of Austrian Danube River navigation rights, including control of downstream traffic. The remaining German assets are valued at approximately 200 million dollars. Western Allied sources point out that the Soviet Union's new proposals still present several difficulties: The aforementioned third item, the remaining German assets, must be converted into freely convertible currency totaling 200 million U.S. dollars, to be repaid by Austria within two years, a large amount of which must be provided by the United States. The obligations attached to German assets are not transferred to the Soviet Union until the date of transfer, which means that Austria will abandon its claims against Germany. In the event of disputes regarding the compliance with the German asset clauses, the countries concerned should resolve them through direct negotiations. Allied sources pointed out that this refusal to accept arbitration makes disputes difficult to resolve. Austrian sources believe that the Soviet Union has already agreed to pay Austria 200 million dollars for all other German assets besides oil and navigation rights, without haggling over the definition of other German assets, which can eliminate the biggest obstacle to the negotiation of the Austrian treaty.

### British-Italian Trade Agreement Signed

[Reuters London, 27th] An Italian spokesperson stated: After 40 days of discussions on British-Italian trade by the British-Italian Joint Economic Committee, the two sides have reached a one-year trade agreement. The meeting has now concluded, and a joint communiquÃ© will be issued on the 28th.

### U.S. Army and Marine Corps Generals Request Funding to Reorganize the Military

[United Press Washington, 27th] Several high-ranking U.S. Army and Marine Corps generals appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee today to present their opinions.

The amount of funding was not announced. However, according to Chief of Staff Eisenhower and his successor Bradley, President Truman's proposed military budget of 11 billion dollars for the next term should be increased by half.

However, the communiquÃ© proposed that the State Department continue to use the current military government and its personnel, and stated that almost all personnel in the military government are currently civilians, and there will be no military personnel within it from July 1st. As for military tasks related to the military occupation, they will continue to be handled by the military. However, no plans have yet been made for changes in the military governments of Korea and Japan.

### Eastern German Political Situation to Undergo Major Changes

Recently, there have been many rumors here about these generals, even claiming that they have formed a German army in the Soviet Union and are being trained by the Soviet Union. If the news of the return of Paulus and others is confirmed, the political situation in East Germany may undergo significant changes.

### Eliminate Racial Discrimination; Marshall Plan Should be Expanded, Secretary of NAACP Says

[Reuters Washington, 28th] Walter White, Secretary-General of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the European Recovery Program should be expanded to Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean, and that the program should include all countries that can best assist the United States in helping the world. White said that hunger is the same whether it is suffered by white people or by yellow, brown, or black people. Countries receiving aid that have colonies must grant freedom to the people of their colonies, and it is foolish for the United States to help white European recovery while denying freedom to the people of colonies. White supremacy in Indonesia, Asia, and Africa has been destroyed forever, and any attempt to rebuild it will lead to a third world war.

### Soviet Union Forbids Officials and Civilians from Contacting Foreigners Without Authorization; Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the Only Agency for Foreign Contact

[United Press Moscow, 28th] The Soviet government today issued an order prohibiting Soviet citizens from talking to foreigners, and designated Molotov's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the only agency for contact with foreigners. The only exceptions are the Ministry of Foreign Trade (which may enter into contracts with foreign countries with the special permission of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and clerks, waiters, and ticket sellers. However, clerks and waiters have also been instructed to limit the topics of conversation to their duties when talking to foreigners, otherwise they will be prosecuted under criminal law, and the penalties have not yet been specified. When any official other than those from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs encounters foreign diplomats, they are not allowed to discuss the issues raised by the latter, but can only reply that inquiries can be sought from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Soviet Union's new decision was passed by the Supreme Soviet on the 16th of last month and published in the official gazette on the 27th. Soviet officials who receive written notices from foreigners should immediately forward them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The procedures for contact between senior military officers and foreign attachÃ©s should be resolved separately by application to the Council of Ministers, meaning that the Council of Ministers can handle such cases individually.

First Task After Entering the State Department

When I entered the State Department, our government was already preparing for the economic conference to be held in London. Preparatory meetings convened by the League of Nations had already been held in Geneva, and a complex agenda had been drafted. To prepare further, the President invited eleven countries with whom we had significant commercial relations to send representatives to Washington to discuss economic issues with us.

In a broadcast address on May 7, 1933, the President enumerated four goals of the talks. They were: reduction of armaments; reduction of trade barriers; stabilization of currency, so that commercial companies could sign contracts in advance; and the rebuilding of friendly relations and greater trust among all nations. In addition, the President and British Prime Minister MacDonald had held a special meeting on the war debt issue, without result.

I rarely participated in the war debt negotiations. The President entrusted that task to Assistant Secretary of State Moley (Raymond Moley). I believed that this issue involved the Treasury Department more than the State Department. In addition, I believed that the war debt issue had become a dead horse, and I was glad not to be too involved in it.

Around this time, Moley came to my apartment one morning. His expression was serious. He then told me that he had no intention of occupying my position as Secretary of State, contrary to the rumors circulating outside. After he left, I said to another visitor, "Moley at least has that thought in his mind." This was later confirmed in many ways, culminating in the London Conference.

In early May 1933, with the President's consent, I instructed Davis (Norman D. Davis), who was stationed in London at the time, to recommend a temporary tariff truce to the organizing committee of the London Economic Conference. The other countries initially opposed, but eventually accepted, albeit with various reservations and explanations.

On May 20th, Moley suddenly delivered a broadcast address without consulting me beforehand or afterward. In this address, he firmly denied that beneficial results could be obtained from the London Conference, and even if the conference was successful, it would be of no benefit. He said that foreign trade was of little importance. This address, broadcast to the entire United States as the actual position of the U.S. government, was clearly inconsistent with the position later adopted in the instructions given to the U.S. delegation sent to London. Moreover, this address was repeatedly rebroadcast in Europe, damaging the position of the U.S. delegation, especially my position. Under these circumstances, Moley should have been severely reprimanded by the President, but unfortunately, Mr. Roosevelt sometimes gave his close friends excessive freedom, without regard for his other friends.

Until the end of May, when the delegation I led was preparing to sail to London, the issue of reducing tariff barriers, which was about to be discussed in London, and the contradiction between the high tariff demands advocated by the National Recovery Administration and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (especially the former) were only briefly discussed. I had a firm position on several purposes for attending the London Conference, one of the main ones being to reduce tariffs. Until we set off, there was no contrary action taken while we were crossing the ocean.

On May 30th, the President received the delegation, which included five members besides myself. The President had not consulted me beforehand when appointing these members.

Mr. Roosevelt gave us a memorandum outlining the policies to be followed in London. He asked us to immediately propose several major issues at the conference, namely: implementing a tariff truce during the conference; establishing general principles for a coordinated monetary and fiscal policy; abolishing foreign exchange restrictions; reaching a basic agreement on gradually eliminating artificial trade barriers and reducing tariffs; and agreeing on the production and distribution of several basic commodities. I had six draft resolutions covering these topics, ready to be proposed in London.

On May 31st, when I set sail from New York on the "President Roosevelt," I had a copy of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in my bag. This bill was then on the President's desk. I expected to be able to show this bill to the other delegations in London to prove that our efforts to reduce tariffs were sincere and capable of being achieved. I hoped that when the conference reached a certain stage, the President could submit the bill to Congress and have it passed. However, developments made it impossible for me to mention it in the conference, only to use it as a reference.

During the voyage, I began a habit that I maintained for many years while traveling back and forth by ship to attend various conferencesâ€”that is, working hard on board. I never got seasick, which I was quite fortunate about. Even on the worst of days, I was able to read and write as I pleased. I often took long walks along the promenade deck as exercise, and occasionally played shuffleboard on the deck. Every day, I held several meetings with the representatives and experts who were with me on the ship, and kept in touch with Washington by radio.

I thought that of the three economic issues of interest to the major countries at the time, I could truly propose only one for discussion in London. These three issues were the war debt issue, the immediate stabilization of currency, and the reduction of trade and tariff barriers. The war debt issue was completely left out. The issue of currency stabilization was prepared for discussion, but was handled solely by experts from the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank. This matter was unrelated to the conference and was not within the scope of the U.S. delegation's work. The only remaining issue was the reduction of trade barriers.

At that time, I began to receive radio messages from Washington on the ship, conveying news of new legislation to raiseâ€”not lowerâ€”tariffs and implement import quotas, indicating that the President would not submit the Trade Agreements Act to Congress. After a week of sailing, I sent a radio telegram to the President on June 7th, saying:

"I hear that the President will not ask Congress to authorize the government to negotiate reciprocal commercial treaties based on mutual tariff concessions, with Congress retaining the right of veto, as proposed in the State Department's draft bill. I sincerely hope that this news is unfounded. After careful consideration, I feel that this approach, besides posing the most significant obstacle to the mission of our delegation attending the London Economic Conference, will delay the power to negotiate such commercial treaties until 1934, which is truly a major mistake."

The President replied, "I fully understand and agree with your anxiety about the actions to be taken on the tariff issue in the current Congress. However, in the last few days of Congress's near-closing, the situation is so tense that an immediate recess has become necessary. Otherwise, profit-sharing legislation, currency inflation, etc., may be forced throughâ€¦ Therefore, tariff-related legislation not only seems extremely inappropriate but also impossible to achieve.

"You have full authority to negotiate general reciprocal commercial treaties in London based on mutual tariff concessions. Furthermore, there is no reason why you cannot prepare to convene meetings in Washington to discuss definite reciprocal agreements with individual countries at length. Once Congress reconvenes, all these agreements, whether general or bilateral, can be submitted to Congress for approval."

This news was a terrible blow. It fundamentally dispelled one of my basic reasons for going to London. Originally, I hoped that with these basic points, I could achieve real results at the conference, so that countriesâ€”albeit graduallyâ€”could extricate themselves from the world depression. The fundamental difference between my position and the views advocated by the President in his telegram was this:

In my view, Congress must authorize the government to negotiate reciprocal trade agreements, including reducing tariffs, and to a certain extent, these agreements could take effect without Senate approval. This point seemed to be achieved in June 1934. However, the method proposed by the President was to negotiate tariff treaties on the old basis, which meant that they had to be submitted to the Senate for approval by a two-thirds majority. This method gave me neither help nor encouragement, because no U.S. Senate had ever approved a trade treaty negotiated by the government that advocated a major reduction in tariffs. Not to mention trade treaties negotiated without prior congressional authorization.

When I arrived in London, the delegations of other countries were already well aware of the extremely difficult situation of the U.S. delegation. On June 9th, the President announced that he would not submit tariff legislation to Congress. The other delegations immediately avoided discussing any treaties, because they believed that this would be indefinitely shelved in Congress.

On June 11th, the day before the opening of the London Conference, the President telegraphed me, saying, "Regarding reducing tariffs and eliminating trade barriers, you need not worry about the situation here. The final debates on domestic issues in Congress endanger the general debate on tariffs for our entire plan.

"I firmly support you, and what is said or done here will not hinder your efforts. There is no reason for your policy or my policy to change. And remember, if we can get the treaty signed, I can convene a special session of the Senate separately in the fall to consider approval."

But I had little hope here. The President supported me verbally, but if I wanted to achieve anything in London, I also needed to be supported by action.

But one extremely important fact should not be ignored, which is that there were vast differences of opinion among almost all countries regarding an acceptable method of reducing trade barriers. Britain was moving towards a quota system. Certain gold standard countries like France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland demanded temporary currency stabilization before considering reducing tariffs. Other countries proposed other preconditions, such as war debt relief.

Never has a conference been as entangled as this one. For most of the time, it seemed to be groping in the dark. Here, provocateurs, agitators, perverse figures, and cunning critics could have a field day.

These conflicting views and attitudes expressed at the London Conference also extended to the members of the U.S. delegation. There were members of the U.S. delegation who advocated high tariffs, such as Senator Pittman. Opinions on the issue of currency stabilization, and indeed on all other issues, differed greatly. It was a mistake for the head of a delegation attending a world conference to have no opportunity to consult with the President beforehand on the selection of all membersâ€”or to allow delegation members to have such a clear impressionâ€”and its misfortune was rarely greater than this. Because in this way, some members lacked a sense of loyalty and cooperation, while other members expressed open contempt. This was my experience.

### City Council and Four Other Groups Host Joint Banquet for North China Petition Delegation, Council Speaker Represents Citizens to Express Concern

[Our Own Report] Yesterday at 6 PM, the Shanghai Municipal City Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, and the Industrial Association jointly hosted a banquet at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company restaurant to welcome the North China Petition Delegation and express their hospitality. Attendees included delegation representatives Shi Zizhou, Xu Huidong, Li Zhuchen, and Ji Aochuan, as well as Council Speaker Pan, Xu Jiyin, Du Yuesheng (represented by Yan Xing), Wu Yunxu, Mayor Wu, Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, Liu Gongyun, Yang Guanbei, Cheng Cangbo, Shu Yunzhang, and Wu Weijing, totaling over a hundred people. The grand gathering lasted until 8:45 PM.

Council Speaker Pan first delivered a speech, stating that he had three impressions of the petition delegation's trip: The delegation's trip has achieved considerable results, demonstrating that the government understands the needs and expectations of the people, and is considering adopting them for implementation, which is a welcome phenomenon. The delegation's requests are not limited to North China or Tianjin, but are relevant to the entire country. The various relevant departments of the central government in Beijing have been sincerely discussing and considering measures to facilitate the flow of goods, demonstrating that the government and the people are fully cooperating in economic policy, which is a good start for the country and the people. Shanghai is still able to live and work in peace under this difficult situation, thanks to the brave soldiers who have fought to suppress the bandits and defend the area, and thanks to the people in the front (such as North China) who have worked hard to build and develop production. The people of North China suffer more than the people of Shanghai, and the people of Shanghai express their deep concern. He hoped that the gentlemen of the delegation would convey the small token of concern from the people of Shanghai to the people of North China.

Subsequently, Xu Jiyin, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association, and Wu Yunxu respectively read written welcoming speeches, expressing deep admiration for the delegation members who had traveled arduously to Beijing to petition on behalf of tens of millions of people in North China. Zhang Xingyan also represented Local Association Chairman Du to pay tribute to the delegation.

Delegation representative Shi Zizhou briefly stated that the petition to Beijing had achieved considerable results, thanks in large part to the support of all sectors of Shanghai. He was deeply grateful for the banquet invitation and hoped that Shanghai could provide more guidance to North China as an elder brother, and that they would implement the instructions in the future. Xu Huidong briefly stated that the North China political and military authorities have a governance vision of two parts politics, three parts military, and five parts economy, which shows that economic factors are an important part of stabilizing the overall situation in North China. Therefore, all economic problems in North China must be resolved reasonably. Finally, Yang Guanbei explained the external transportation price and sales situation of fine flour in Shanghai. The meeting adjourned at 8:45 PM.

### Extravagant Farewell Event at the Tianchan Stage: Recovered Soldiers Return to the Front Lines, A Convoy of 28 Vehicles Rolls Grandly, Residents Along the Way Light Firecrackers and Cheer

"Miss Shanghai" Wang Yunmei Represents the People in Presenting a Banner to the Warriors

[Our Own Report] Yesterday, various sectors of the city held a grand meeting at the Tianchan Stage to bid farewell to recovered soldiers returning to the front lines and to express their appreciation. Mayor Wu, Council Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, as well as the Commander of the Garrison District, Fu Zhengmo, Commander of the Wusong Fortress, Shao Baichuan, Commander of the Air Force, Wang Weimin, Chairman of the City Federation of Trade Unions, Shui Xiangyun, and representative of the Women's Association, Lu Huimin, all attended and delivered speeches. The atmosphere at the meeting was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. The meeting lasted from 11:30 AM to 2:30 PM.

At 7 AM, a white jeep, adorned with a red banner and broadcasting "Shao Kuai Le Troupe's Comedic Songs," slowly led the way. Behind it followed a long convoy of 28 military vehicles from the port command, fully loaded with over three thousand recovered soldiers from the 20th and 101st Rear Hospitals. The convoy departed from the Army Friends Society on Wusong Road and passed through North Sichuan Road, Tianhougong Bridge, Beijing Road, Xizang Road, and Fuzhou Road before arriving at the Tianchan Stage. Residents along the way and stores on both sides set off firecrackers to express their respect and waved to cheer the recovered soldiers on the trucks. A wounded soldier from the 20th Rear Hospital told a reporter: "For the first time in my life, I was moved to tears. It is already a disgrace for a soldier not to die on the battlefield. What does a little injury matter? The country has treated us too well, and the people have moved us even more."

Work Hard to Eliminate the Communists, Persevere and Strive On

The meeting was presided over by Mayor Wu, who, in addition to expressing the respect of all sectors of Shanghai to all recovered soldiers, pointed out that the current situation in China, where the people cannot live and work in peace, is caused by the Communist bandits. He hoped that the recovered soldiers would return to the front lines and continue to use their previous spirit to work hard to eliminate the communists. Council Speaker Pan represented the five million citizens of the city in bidding farewell to all the soldiers, and said: "The communist rebellion is not simply a bandit problem, it has an international background. The communist bandits sell out the nation and are willing to be the vanguard of foreign invaders. They are no longer Chinese nationals. Shanghai's ability to live in peace depends entirely on you going back to the front lines and smashing the communist bandits' conspiracy. We must also use this shout of farewell to awaken those who are living in a dreamlike state." Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters said: "If the communist bandits are not eliminated for one day, the country cannot be built for one day, the people cannot live in peace for one day, and China cannot be stable for one day, which means that the world cannot be peaceful for one day. Your success in suppressing the bandits and achieving success in the front lines will not only make you national heroes of China, but also heroes of the world."

A Perfect Shot of Heroes and Beauties

After representatives from all sectors delivered their speeches, the microphone announced that "Miss Shanghai" Wang Yunmei would represent the citizens of Shanghai in presenting a banner to the two rear hospitals. Recovered soldiers' representatives An Yin and Zhuo Jingliu stepped forward to receive the banner, and the presentation ceremony was completed amidst music and applause. Photography reporters from various newspapers and cameramen from the Central Film Studio flocked to capture this "heroes and beauties" shot. The entertainment program included the "Big Doll's Big Tonic Pot"; singing by Misses Luo Ling, Huang Lifang, Kang Hua, and Ye Minzhi; soft acrobatics by overseas Chinese Miss Zhang Baoyu; magic by the Shen family troupe; and finally, the famous actors Ma Lianliang and Zhang Junqiu performing the Peking opera "You Long Xi Feng" (Roaming Dragon and Playing with the Phoenix). The entire performance lasted for over three hours.

### Strengthening Meteorological Reporting: Beijing Headquarters Relocated to Shanghai, Decision to Merge Operations

### Police Bureau Launches Comprehensive Inspection: Carry Your ID When Going Out

[Our Own Report] As the Lunar New Year is approaching, the Municipal Police Bureau has decided to implement a comprehensive inspection from today until the 9th of next month to crack down on the seasonal crime wave.

According to a responsible person from the Police Bureau yesterday, citizens are advised to carry their identification cards with them during this period to avoid trouble during inspections.

### A Major Combination in the Cultural World: The Artists Association Held its Annual Meeting Yesterday

Target Reality, Urge Intensified Efforts to Suppress the Rebellion

[Our Own Report] The Shanghai Artists Association held its first annual meeting at the Zhapu Road Cultural Hall at 2 PM yesterday. Over six hundred members attended, including Yu Wen, Wang Jinshan, Liu Haisu, Zheng Wuchang, He Tianjian, Lu Danlin, Yan Duhe, and Shi Chongpeng. City Councilor Pan, the Chairman of the City Council, and Director Fang of the City Party Headquarters also attended the meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Yu Wen reported that the Shanghai Artists Association was established last year, and in the past year, the number of members has increased to more than five hundred, symbolizing a major combination in Shanghai's cultural world. In the past, some people believed that artists only need to diligently pursue their personal art and do not need to consider social responsibility, but this idea is not entirely correct. What day is today? The communist party, which betrays the country and harms the people, is causing trouble everywhere. Not to mention the widespread war in the north, the people only dozens of miles away from Shanghai cannot live and work in peace. If the communist party comes to Shanghai, can we still hold meetings here? Can we still maintain a minimum standard of living? Therefore, in the future, the artists should unanimously target reality, and continuously strike at the Communist Party in terms of the content and ideas of their works. Every word and action should be coordinated with the suppression of the rebellion and the building of the country, so as to increase the strength of the country and overcome the difficult situation.

Director Fang of the City Party Headquarters then delivered a speech, believing that the purpose of studying art is to seek the beautification of life, society, and the country. When the entire society reaches a state of beautification, phenomena such as corruption and darkness will have no way to occur. Therefore, he hoped that the artists would fulfill their responsibility as pillars of the country. Secondly, in the current period of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, soldiers on the front lines are fighting bloody battles, and people in the rear should each stay at their posts, using their hands or their mouths to work hard to promote national policies, so as to quell the bandit rebellion and restore unity and peace.

### To Seek Social Stability, Art Should Be Promoted

After Mr. Fang finished speaking, Council Speaker Pan arrived in time. The council speaker first strongly criticized the common misconception that during times of world turmoil and material hardship, it is inappropriate to talk about art. He argued that art is a necessary cultivation of life, and that humans are different from animals because humans have an innate ability to love art and appreciate art. People whose thoughts and lives can reach a state of beautification will be able to transcend the material environment. Even if life is more difficult, their works will be more outstanding. There are countless examples of this throughout history, both in China and abroad. The reason why today's society is turbulent and uneasy is also due to the lack of artistic cultivation of the general public. Therefore, to seek social stability, promoting art is the way to solve the problem at its root. He deeply hoped that the artists would not only seek progress in their personal works, but also take on the responsibility of enlightening the innate aesthetic psychology of their compatriots. This is one point. Secondly, modern science has developed to the point where the world is one family, but spiritual thought is far behind. The reason for this is the extreme nationalism of people like Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo Hideki, and the extreme classism of people like Stalin. Nothing hinders the development of human thought more than this. Only the thinking of us Chinese people, the so-called "governing the country and pacifying the world," is most suitable for the trend of the times. Therefore, he hoped that the art world would take on the mission of promoting this kind of thinking from the art field first, so that human spirit can receive a new baptism and move towards the world of great harmony.

Finally, Mr. Yan Duhe, the director, delivered a speech, encouraging artists to be more closely connected with society and do more work that is beneficial to society, so as to popularize and democratize art.

### Two Papers Read, Eight Proposals Passed

Two papers were then read, one by Liu Shi, "Research on Modern French Painting," and one by Xu Shiqi, "Reasons for the Decline of Chinese Figure Painting."

Finally, the directors and supervisors were re-elected, and the proposals were discussed and passed: To send representatives to request Mayor Wu to allocate funds early to build an art museum. To organize an art visit group to visit Taiwan and Hong Kong. To organize art lectures to study and expand art movements. To hold a joint charity exhibition of the Shanghai art world to raise funds for the art museum. In coordination with the national art movement, the Shanghai Artists Association will be renamed the Shanghai Artists Association. To send a telegram to the Central Government in the name of the conference, urging intensified efforts to mobilize and suppress the rebellion. To send a telegram to Chairman Chiang to pay tribute. To send a telegram to Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the National Artists Association of China, to pay tribute. Finally, the meeting was adjourned after a screening of Cathay Film's "Love, Love" film.

### Lottery Decided to Proceed as Scheduled: Last Struggle of the Dance Industry

[Our Own Report] Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, the Social Bureau summoned Sun Hongyuan, Chairman of the Dance Hall Industry Association, to the bureau for talks. Yuan Wenzhang, the Fourth Section Chief, informed him that in order to implement the ban on dancing, the Social Bureau will hold a lottery at the bureau at 3 PM on the 31st to determine which half of the dance halls should close by the end of March. At that time, the dance hall industry is also expected to send representatives to participate. Sun Hongyuan said that he was unable to decide whether or not to participate in the lottery and would need to wait for the dance industry's investors and dancers to hold a general meeting on the morning of the 31st to discuss and decide. The ban on dancing will have little impact on the investors, as the original site of the dance hall can be converted into a movie theater or a shopping mall. However, the consequences of dancers and workers losing their jobs are worrying. Therefore, they intend to go to Nanjing again to petition and attempt a final rescue. Director Yuan informed him that the local government has done its best to ban dancing in the city. The decision to hold a lottery on the 31st will stand. If the dance hall industry does not send representatives to participate at that time, the lottery will still proceed as scheduled.

### Annual Bonus for Light Bulb Industry Resolved: Huade Factory Once Slowed Down Work

[Our Own Report] The Social Bureau's Year-End Bonus Processing Committee is scheduled to hold its third meeting at 3 PM this afternoon to discuss the closing of the committee and the handling of outstanding cases.

The issue of year-end bonuses for workers in the light bulb manufacturing industry has been resolved after mediation by Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Trade Union, and representatives of the Electrical Industry Association. It is stipulated that 25 days of wages will be paid, based on the December 1947 index. In addition, Huade Light Bulb Factory once slowed down work because the investors only agreed to pay 20 days, but work has resumed after persuasion.

The year-end bonus issue for occupational workers in the Western clothing, fashion, sewing, and leather shoe industries was previously decided by the Labor-Management Evaluation Subcommittee to persuade both labor and management to reach a resolution. Yesterday, workers sent representatives to petition the Social Bureau. Zhao Banfu, the Deputy Director of the Year-End Bonus Processing Committee, said that he would urge the investors to reply and seek a resolution as soon as possible.

### Beijing Shoe Store "Starvation Strike": Federation to Send Personnel for Investigation

[Our Own Report] Thirty-five workers at the No. 3 workshop of the Beijing Shoe Store at No. 48 Baokang Lane, Linsen Middle Road, have been on "starvation strike" since the afternoon of the 26th. According to workers, they had previously agreed with the investors that the index for the part of the base salary above 30 yuan would not be discounted from the seventh to the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month, and that working hours would be extended. Now the investors are not fulfilling the agreement. After unsuccessful negotiations, they are implementing a "starvation strike." The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee sent personnel yesterday to investigate the incident, and it will be handled by the Social Bureau.

### Cars Brought Back from Abroad Allowed to Be Transferred and Licensed

[Our Own Report] According to the regulations on private car restrictions during the emergency period promulgated by the central government, cars brought back from abroad are not eligible for licenses and cannot be resold. After the municipal government submitted a document to the Executive Yuan requesting amendments, the Public Works Bureau received instructions from the central government yesterday that they are allowed to be transferred to others. Those sold to qualified car owners will be allowed to be licensed.

### 56 Fish Merchants Jointly Submit Petition: Opposing the Cancellation of the Shanghai Fish Market

Regarding the case of Lin Chengzong, a standing director of the Shanghai Fish Merchants Association, going to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Agriculture to request the cancellation of the fish market, the Fish Industry Association said that there were many twists and turns behind the matter. 56 members of the association, including Yongyuan Fish Bank, have jointly submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Agriculture to state the truth. It is also stated that Lin Chengzong's petition to Beijing on behalf of the Fish Industry Association, claiming that the 21st board of directors and supervisors meeting decided to request the cancellation of the Shanghai Fish Market to reduce the pain of the industry, was an individual attempt by Lin Chengzong. As a result, Jin Chuxiang, the association's director, was constrained and unable to achieve his ambitions, and resigned in anger. Furthermore, regarding the cancellation of the fish market, most of the directors and supervisors believe that the Shanghai Fish Market was established based on a government order, and members have no right to make wild statements about the issue of survival or abolition, so they strongly advocate caution and express dissent. In addition, the association has no record of Lin Chengzong's petition to Beijing, and although the petition states that there are more than 40 fish firms that have signed it, it is impossible to know whether there are non-members included. Lin Chengzong has not publicly disclosed the contents of the petition, which is clearly a separate attempt by Lin Chengzong under the guise of the Fish Industry Association, so it is unanimously denied.

### Peiping-Shanghai Air Transport Drug Trafficking Case: Initial Public Trial of Ten Defendants

Li Jianfei's Confessions are Inconsistent

[Our Own Report] In the major case of air transport drug trafficking between Peiping and Shanghai, in which more than 90 catties of morphine were seized, the Criminal Court of the District Court held its first public trial yesterday, presided over by Judge Shen Tianbao. Because there were many defendants in the case, the trial will be held over two days, yesterday and today. Yesterday, the defendants who impersonated a colonel officer, Li Jianfei, Haizi, (also known as Mai Changde), Jia Renfa, Kong Fanzhen, Bu Longfu, Danqing, Ma Xueyi, Mai Lizhi, Chen Jixi, and Mai Jinbao, were questioned.

Li Jianfei first confessed that in November of last year, he and his friend Zhang Guangyu flew from Peiping to Shanghai on the same plane. The morphine was hidden on Zhang's body. Because he was unemployed, he asked Zhang to introduce him to a job. Zhang agreed to introduce him to the Ministry of National Defense. Before it was successful, Zhang advised him to transport drugs, with a reward of 20 million yuan each time. The Colonel Staff Officer certificate from the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense was also given by Zhang. It is unknown whether it was forged. He does not know who the backstage boss behind the drug trafficking is. He does not know who owns the more than 80 catties of drugs seized in Nanshi. He met Mai Renfa on the plane and did not know him in the past. Mai Renfa confessed that he is related to Mai Changde and met Li Jianfei on the plane. The ten taels of gold and 80 million yuan in cash that he was carrying were not for the purchase of drugs. The last time he went to Beiping, he was entrusted by Mai Changde's wife to take the luggage to Henan, which did not contain drugs. He did not carry morphine on his leg when he came to Shanghai from Peiping. The other defendants all denied trafficking in drugs. After the questioning, all the defendants were returned to custody and will be questioned again today.

### Accused of Embezzling Rationed Goods: Ward Chief and Others Summoned for Interrogation

[Our Own Report] The ward chief of the 8th Ward of the 14th District of Zhabei, Fu Daosheng, and the district people's representative, Yu Luolin, were sued by the ward residents for embezzling civilian rationed rice. Yesterday, they were interrogated by the District Attorney's Office, and the plaintiffs' representatives Zheng Chaozhen, Wang Chengfu, Xu Renjie, Zhang Yiming, and Liu Chunshan, as well as the defendants Fu and Yu, were present. The main points of the case are: The rationed rice for civilians in each ward should be one dou for a large family and five sheng for a small family, but Ward Chief Chuan only distributed two sheng and five he for a large family, and did not distribute anything for a small family. There are a total of 14,000 households in the ward, and about 700 shi of rice were embezzled. Oil and sugar are not distributed according to the number of households, and even when they are distributed, they are discounted by 20% to 30%. Each household is charged 2,000 yuan for baojia (mutual responsibility system) fees, without issuing receipts, and the accounts are never made public. After the prosecutor finished questioning, he ordered the defendants and plaintiffs to return, and the interrogation will be held again at a later date.

### Cao Hang Township Murder Case: Transferred to District Attorney's Office for Investigation

[Our Own Report] The Shanghai County Government yesterday transferred the case of Jin Jiasheng, a carpenter from Jinjiatang, the 1st Ward of Cao Hang Township, Shanghai County, being murdered by his wife, Zhou, to the District Attorney's Office for investigation. The case occurred around the 18th of this month. Because Jin had another lover outside and did not care about the family's livelihood, Zhou was extremely angry and bribed her neighbors Jin Cai and Jin Xuesheng to kill Jin in the middle of the night and bury him under the pigsty. Zhou pretended that Jin had disappeared. After investigation by the township office, the incident came to light. The District Attorney's Office had previously sent personnel to the township to examine the body.

### Shen Gongwei and Li Zhen Indicted

[Our Own Report] The case of Shen Gongwei and the "Foreign Nunu" Li Zhen being accused of undermining the family by Shen's wife, Mao Xiuzhen, was indicted by the District Attorney's Office yesterday. Shen and Li are co-conspirators in Article 28 of the Criminal Law and Article 239 of the same law (a person who has a spouse and commits adultery with another person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year). Shen is also guilty of Article 186 of the Criminal Law for the crime of endangering public safety due to private possession of firearms. The case will be transferred to the Criminal Court of the District Court for trial within days.

### Two Enthusiastic Readers Generously Donate Large Sums to Support Education

Yesterday was the seventeenth day of the "Reader's Education Assistance Fund" micro-donation campaign, and we received new encouragement and two large donations. One reader personally came to our office and said: "Reading the words in Shen Bao over the past few days appealing for donations for impoverished students has deeply moved me. When I was young, I dropped out of school because of poverty, so I can personally experience the pain of being out of school! Now I am the owner of several yarn factories, and I have enough power to help a few poor students. Today I brought 50 million yuan to donate to the 'Reader's Education Assistance Fund,' but please do not publish my name, just write 'Anonymous' in the donation report."

Another anonymous person also came to this office at 2 pm yesterday to donate 60 million yuan to the "Reader's Education Assistance Fund," saying: This is a birthday gift from relatives and friends to an old lady. Considering the large number of out-of-school youths, they decided to donate all the savings to the "Education Assistance Fund." The appeal of the past ten days has finally achieved considerable results. Yesterday alone, we received 110 million yuan in donations, setting a new record for "Reader's Education Assistance Fund" donations. However, we hope that people in society who possess wealth can emulate the generous actions of these two "anonymous" individuals, actively donate, and enable this education assistance movement to achieve its expected goals as soon as possible.

### Large Flower Found in Shelter; All Refugees Vaccinated Against Smallpox

[Report from this newspaper] The Winter Relief Association's third work-for-relief shelter discovered a refugee with smallpox the day before yesterday. The epidemic prevention committee transferred him to the First Infectious Disease Hospital for treatment yesterday. The epidemic prevention committee also sent personnel to the shelter to vaccinate all refugees against smallpox and will conduct disinfection today.

Furthermore, Yuan Wenzhang, deputy leader of the Winter Relief Association's investigation and release team and director of the Fourth Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, is scheduled to inspect the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth work-for-relief shelters in Pudong this morning.

### Chronicle of Disaster Relief Efforts

The silver and money industry colleagues' disaster relief movement has raised 150 million yuan in lieu of goods and 600 pieces of winter clothing (500 pieces have been sent to the Winter Relief Association's second shelter). They have also purchased 55 dan of xian rice and 200 dozen towels, which have been distributed to various disaster areas. They also plan to purchase 50 million yuan worth of medicines to conduct medical consultations and dispense medicines.

The Huining Native Place Association in Shanghai, because the two counties of Hui and Mi suffered serious bandit disasters and heavy losses, specially convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors to discuss relief for the disaster victims in the two counties.

The Anxinggang area in the eastern district of Gaochen County, Southern Jiangsu, suffered a severe drought and locust plague last year, affecting more than 100,000 disaster victims. Zhang Ding and Wang Zhongjun, the heads of the county's winter relief association, sent telegrams to fellow villagers in Beijing and Shanghai yesterday, widely soliciting donations to benefit the disaster victims.

### The Words "Tin Foil Money" Cause Trouble; Apprentice at World Book Company Fired

[Report from this newspaper] Yu Yaoting, an apprentice in the printing and lithography department of the World Book Company, wrote the words "tin foil money" on the receipt when he received his year-end bonus and handed it over to the employer. The employer considered it intentional insult and fired him. According to Yu Yaoting, after receiving the year-end bonus, he immediately thought about buying fish, meat, tin foil, and other items to return to his hometown for the New Year, and he wrote these three words subconsciously. He asked the employer for forgiveness. The matter is currently being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau.

### Difficulties for Motorized Junk Merchants Association; Preparing to Sue Shipping Industry

[Report from this newspaper] The motorized junk merchants in this city requested to join the Shipping Industry Trade Association but were rejected. After several mediations by the Social Affairs Bureau, no results were obtained, and the stalemate has lasted for more than ten months. A few days ago, the motorized junk merchants asked a lawyer to publish an advertisement on their behalf, appealing to the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Shipping Administration Bureau. According to news from the Shipping Administration Bureau yesterday, they have not received official documents regarding the motorized junk merchants' advertisement, so they are not convenient to intervene. As for the matter of motorized junks joining the shipping industry association, there has long been an order to the association, explaining that motorized junks belong to ships and should be allowed to join the association. According to the motorized junk merchants, if the shipping industry association makes no further statement, they will file a lawsuit.

The Fumin Shipping Company's Great Wall express ship, which specializes in the Tianjin-Shanghai line, has a very high speed because it was originally converted from an escort warship. On the 25th of this month, the ship sailed from Tianjin to Shanghai. Due to the severe cold in Beiyang, the ice was very thick, and the seawater was particularly shallow, causing it to run aground outside Dagu Port. Later, the ship used wireless radio to notify the Tianjin branch, and the China Merchants Bureau sent a tugboat to rescue it. It is now known that the ship has been released from the shoal and safely sailed to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive at 5 pm today.

### US Military Advisory Group Burglarized; Six Criminals Arrested, Stolen Goods Recovered

[Report from this newspaper] The US Army Advisory Group's engineering office at the intersection of Gangche, Shan Lu, and Dalian Road was burglarized at midnight on the 19th, losing machinery, motors, wires, and other items worth over 200 million yuan. The group's representative, an American named English (resident at 1226 Xin Zha Road), reported the information to the Municipal Police Bureau.

### Brand New Customs Gold Unit Notes; Four Thieves Arrested After Using Stolen Money

[Report from this newspaper] The Lianglu Police Department recently arrested a large number of habitual thieves, including the famous giant thief Ma Junjie, also known as Sun Xiaoshan.

### Voice from Yanbei; A Panoramic View of the Ancient City of Datong

[Airmail report from Beiping on the 20th] Datong, strategically located outside Yanmen Pass, has been a battleground for those vying for power since ancient times. Not to mention twenty years ago, the Mongolian cavalry from the desert and the agricultural people inside the Great Wall had already stained the ancient city with the wind, blood, and rain. Even in modern times, the gain or loss of Datong is related to the safety of the world. During the Ming Dynasty, the three prefectures of Daning, Xuanhua, and Datong were located outside the Great Wall to defend the northern frontier. After the loss of Daning, the right wing was damaged, leading to the Tumu Crisis of Emperor Yingzong of Ming. Fortunately, the Datong elite troops on the left wing provided eastern support, reversing the dangerous situation. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Li Zicheng also captured Datong first before daring to compete for the capital. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese army also held Datong tightly in their hands, watching over Chahar and Suiyuan. After the victory, Datong, the gateway to northern Shanxi and a vulnerable place for bandits in Chahar and Suiyuan, also experienced many changes. At the beginning of Japan's surrender, Fu Zuoyi's cavalry advanced rapidly into Datong. At that time, Quan Liu, commander of the Twelfth War Zone, was outside the inner Great Wall. Later, Chu Xichun, under the orders of Yan Xishan, led his troops to return to northern Shanxi, and the twelve counties outside Yanmen Pass were allowed to return to the jurisdiction of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters. Last August, the Chinese Communists also wanted to remove this nail, connecting Chahar and Suiyuan. They gathered more than 50,000 people, changed commanders four times, and besieged the city for 45 days. Finally, due to the support of the Fu troops and the battle of Jining, the siege of Datong was lifted. Afterwards, this continuously developed into the Battle of Zhangjiakou, transforming the entire military situation in North China.

A Kite with a Broken String

Datong is 400 li from Taiyuan. Since the Tongpu Railway between Huairen and Xin County was cut off, it has been isolated outside Yanmen Pass, becoming a kite with a broken string in Taiyuan's hands. Zuoyun and Youyu, which are related to the stability of southern Suiyuan, are stationed with troops from Zhang's Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters. The Ping-Sui Railway's northern Shanxi corridor, which connects Chahar and Suiyuan, is also stationed with considerable troops.

In order to continuously strike Yanbei, Yan Xishan also established two institutions. On the military side, there was the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters Datong Command, originally commanded by Chu Xichun, representing Yan to govern the military affairs of Yanbei. After the successful conclusion of the Battle of Datong, Chu retired and drifted away. Afterwards, the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters announced that Yu Zhenhe, the former military leader of a certain army, would succeed Chu.

On the political side, the Shanxi Provincial Government also established the Jinbei Administrative Office in Datong, governing the eighth and tenth special commissioner districts of Yanbei and the eleventh special commissioner district of Hequ, totaling 19 counties. Director Meng Xiangzhi is one of Yan's brains trust, with a careful mind and skilled in speech. He is quite capable of handling his difficult work.

A Breath of Yan Xishan

Taiyuan's political pattern has changed somewhat in Yanbei. For example, the vigorous integration of soldiers and farmers in the 25 counties around Taiyuan has not spread to Yanmen Pass. It is said that Yan Xishan instructed that unless more than half of the people automatically request it, the 13 counties in Yanbei do not need to implement the integration of soldiers and farmers. Although there are many soldiers in Jinbei, it is clear that they have not exceeded half of the strong men.

However, it is still full of the atmosphere of Taiyuan, just not very strong.

Yan Xishan's political style and tactics also have their Jinbei version. For example, the current slogan popular in Datong is: In military affairs, oppose disturbing the people; in politics, oppose corruption; in the economy, oppose exploitation; in life, oppose inequality; in thought, oppose left and right leaning... and so on. Administrative Director Meng Xiangzhi told reporters that the Jinbei military and political institutions are now concentrating their efforts on the following tasks: Actively collecting food to prepare for the defense of Datong again. Strengthening city defense works to compensate for the lack of troops. Rushing to build roads, the highway from Zhangjiakou to Datong has been completed. Eliminating disguised elements. Establishing struggle committees at all levels. Whatever is lacking, struggle for it. Small things like not being punctual, big things like work paralysis... are all objects of struggle. Struggle against yourself, struggle against others, groups struggle against groups, to maintain political clarity and efficiency. For example, the sixth discussion meeting of the Datong County Struggle Committee decided to submit a written struggle against Datong County Chief E Mingxian for not attending the Struggle Committee three times and not asking for leave, "to correct his unprogressive performance and promote his thorough transformation."

The Grain War

The military grain for 19,000 people in Jinbei has caused the people of Datong to rack their brains. The grain department's purchase price for military grain is as slow as an old ox cart, while the active market price of grain is always as fast as a galloping horse. The grain price issued by the Yanbei military grain from April to June to purchase in the market would be short 10,454 bags, which would increase the burden on the people by 15 billion. Now, military grain is about to be purchased again. Calculating it, purchasing with the issued price is still a huge number short. The local people are complaining that the grain department set the issued price too low and issued it too slowly. However, the chief of the 38th station, Chi Yao, was very clear-headed. Based on the grain price at the time, after submitting the request, the grain department did not discount it at all and quickly allocated the funds. However, when purchasing, the grain price suddenly jumped. Even with half wheat and half millet, it would increase by an average of one-quarter. Who is to blame?

The problem is not limited to this. According to government regulations, soldiers should eat white flour, but Yanmen Pass is the hometown of wheat and millet. Wheat can only be sought from Chahar and Suiyuan, and the grain shortage in Peiping and Tianjin is severe. Suiyuan and Chahar are also trying to make their military and civilian food self-sufficient. Even with banknotes, it is not easy to turn them into something to relieve hunger. In order to solve the grain problem in many ways, the authorities mobilized local armed forces to launch grain-grabbing battles day and night. It is said that the results are quite impressive. All these mixed grains are enough to supply the military and civilians for half a year.

A World of Refugees

The city of Datong is now home to six county chiefs. In addition to the Datong county chief, the other five county chiefs from Shanyin, Shuoxian, and other counties have established exile governments in Datong City. Most of the exile county government buildings have two signs hanging in front of them. One sign, needless to say, is the government of a certain county. The other sign is the refugee shelter of a certain county. Because the county territory has been lost and there is nothing to do, they can only accommodate some refugees. In reality, due to limited funds, they cannot afford to accommodate them, so those shelters only allow newly arrived refugees to settle down there briefly.

Datong is a city with more than 100,000 people. According to the report of the Datong County Chief, refugees account for 50,000 of them. There are only two institutions for rescuing refugees: one is the relief center, which can accommodate 400 refugees, and the other is the relief branch, which can accommodate 70 refugees. In the past, the UNRRA branch also distributed relief supplies to refugees. Although it could not solve the problem, now that UNRRA has been cancelled, even that cup of water has disappeared. The cold wind from the north is tightening, and the famine wind in North China is intensifying. How will the millions of God's children without clothes or food rely on their own efforts to survive the long winter?

For the refugee problem, the local military and political authorities are also experiencing conflicting feelings. They are happy that the refugees' return shows their allegiance to the government, but they are worried that their city cannot control enough villages and obtain food sources, and that each refugee cannot bring their own warehouse from their own village or small town (assuming they have one).

Not far from Datong is the Kouquan coal mine. After 4 pm every day, the local security is in a chaotic state. The famous Zhigang Stone Buddha is also avoided by pedestrians, which is even more desolate.

Local military authorities all told reporters that they hope the central government will attach importance to Datong's strategic position, increase funding for city defense and replace ordnance, and request to increase Datong's troop strength, which is secondary. One major general said: "We want to increase Datong's defense power by strengthening fortifications and strengthening equipment!" (Special Correspondent Zhang Jianmei)

### Yang Yinlin Died in Prison; On His Deathbed, He Confessed to His Accomplice Lu Xiaodi; Seven 79 Rifles Seized at His Address

The person and the rifles have now been sent to the county.

### Free Voting, Fair Competition: A Glimpse of the Election Education Movement in Nanhui

[Nanhui 27th Dispatch] Taking advantage of this legislative election, Nanhui has launched a widespread election education movement, which is truly an innovation in county-level elections in China. The process of this matter is as follows: In the past, elections in local areas were often manipulated by the township heads in charge. The public not only didn't see the ballots, but even didn't know there was an election at all. At the same time, the township heads, because they controlled

large numbers of votes

would wait to be bought. If a candidate wanted to obtain votes, he had to negotiate terms with them. This also created a kind of election broker, running between candidates and local officials who held the votes, negotiating and connecting, creating a smoky atmosphere and generating many unnecessary disputes. "Elections" became "election disasters." What democracy could be talked about? Progressive people in Nanhui knew that this was an unreasonable phenomenon and were determined not to let it happen, so they launched this movement. They wanted to educate the candidates so that everyone could campaign publicly and compete fairly. They wanted to educate the election staff so that they would not withhold ballots or interfere with people's voting. They wanted to educate the voters not to give up their right to vote and actively participate in voting.

With this motivation, they then organized a "Nanhui County Election Education Movement Promotion Association," with the participation of the county party headquarters, the county government's education section, the China Construction Pudong Work Station, the county bank, and the Pujian Company. Chen Tao was appointed as a member and general manager, and Gu Dangqing, Weng Bixian, Zhang Keping, Shen Zhilian, Pan Ziping, Shen Mengqing, and others were appointed as members. In addition, in every township in the county, a

Election Education Team

was established, composed of the township head, the principal of the central school, and the liaison officer sent by the promotion association to each township. Below the township level, security units were also established. Each team was composed of the security chief, the security representative, the principal of the security national school, and the security liaison officer. There were a total of 30 township teams and 499 security teams in the county. The total number of personnel involved in the work exceeded 2,500. Thanks to the initiation of these enthusiastic people, after two weeks of effort, the promotion association finally achieved the expected results.

After the promotion association was established, the first step was naturally publicity, especially widespread and universal publicity for all voters in the county. They organized many propaganda teams, organized by the schools, organized by the township election education teams, and organized by the promotion association itself, totaling about ten teams, working in various places. The methods they adopted included posting slogans and leaflets, disguised speeches, and performing street plays. The content was very different from general campaign propaganda. For example, they wanted voters to have

Interest in elections

and understand election procedures. They put forward the following many slogans:

"Let's have a model election!"

"Let our Nanhui County get first place in the national elections!"

"Vote freely, without interference from anyone!"

"If someone interferes with voting, report to the supervisor immediately."

Regarding the candidates, they paid attention to public and universal introduction, and never made blind recommendations. What they put forward was:

"Welcome candidates, regardless of county affiliation, to openly and fairly compete."

"Oppose anyone colluding with election personnel to deceive public opinion."

"If someone can work for the people's welfare, vote for him!"

"Be careful, selling your vote is selling your own soul!"

At the same time, because candidate Wang Genzhong was a local of Nanhui and usually was able to enthusiastically contribute to local construction projects and community public welfare, the public inevitably had an idol-like worship of him. The election education promotion association, in order to achieve

Fair Election, from the outset, did not hesitate to use slogans to break this idol. They put forward:

"Examine Wang Genzhong. If he has ever abused his power for personal gain, don't vote for him!" "If he has ever oppressed the people, don't vote for him!"

"Examine Wang Genzhong. If he has ever extorted a penny from the people, don't vote for him!"

These many slogans, along with the footprints of every propagandist, penetrated into every village.

The materials for street plays and disguised propaganda were similar to the content of these slogans, wanting

Everyone to vote, wanting everyone not to give up their rights, but the introduction of the candidates was very objective and very universal. Even Wang Genzhong's own Pudong Local Construction Company, the slogans posted on its vehicles never said "Please vote for Mr. Wang Genzhong." What was used instead was the list of all candidates, and the slogan of "Free Election, Fair Competition." The success of this Nanhui election education was greatly due to publicity and visits.

The candidates' campaign activities in Nanhui were also very common. Wu Shaoshu, Yan Xinqi, and others all sent representatives to come, but this kind of so-called "vote buying" was not feasible. The only way was to win the sympathy of the voters. Only by gaining the sympathy of the voters could one get votes. This sentence is absolutely correct in Nanhui.

After the launch of this election education movement, the total number of voters reached 232,313, accounting for 90% of the number of voters, which can be considered a great harvest.

### Solving County-Level Financial Problems: Assembly Speakers of Ten Counties Decide to Petition

[Our Newspaper, Fengxian 26th Dispatch] Since the central government expressly ordered that the 30% of the land tax originally belonging to the central government be allocated to the province, the ten county assembly members of the third district of Jiangsu Province, because each county's finances were extremely difficult, and the income and expenditure could not be balanced, and the people's burdens were already impossible to increase, therefore the assembly members of Baoshan, Fengxian, and other ten counties jointly petitioned the Yuan, Ministry, and Provincial Departments, requesting that the land tax be equally distributed between the provincial and county levels to alleviate the current financial difficulties of the county level and reduce the people's burdens. On the afternoon of the 25th, the assembly speakers of Tian, Song, Feng, Jin, Qing, Nan, Chuan, Shang, Jia, Bao, and Chong ten counties gathered in Shanghai and went to the province together to petition. Also, according to reports: The ten county assembly speakers' trip to the province to petition was decided at a symposium on the 19th, and the county assembly was chosen to draft the petition. Assembly Speaker Cheng of this county specially took the petition documents to Shanghai on the morning of the 25th to meet with the assembly speakers of ten counties to go to the province.

The price of 20 medium sand white was 1,640,000 yuan, Shan Genqing was 1,456,000 yuan, a small amount of 10,000 yuan. The price of Xinghua Chi High Goods was 1,550,000 yuan, Diaoqing was 1,380,000 yuan, recycled goods were 370,000 yuan, and Taiqing was 1,300,000 yuan, and the secondary was 1,250,000 yuan.

### The Tea Market Is on a Solid Footing

The foreign merchant tea market, exporters are still extremely active in the situation of foreign sales of tea and domestic sales of patterns. Green tea has remained in the lead due to the consumption of local merchants and foreign merchants, so there are still many inquiries. Unfortunately, the inventory in the market has not increased so far, and the transaction volume has not increased more than the previous day in the lack of supply. In terms of price, they have continued to show their elegance, and there is no sign of falling.

### Remittances to North China Have Not Stopped

[This newspaper] National Bank officials said that remittances to North China have not stopped in recent months. If there are legitimate uses for industry and commerce, they have been approved separately. In the future, industrial and commercial remittances should also be approved for exchange based on the circumstances. It is also rumored that after the petition delegation from North China went to Beijing, the Central Bank decided to provide funds to alleviate the difficulties of North China's industry and export industry by purchasing. National Bank officials refused to comment on this point.

Chinese Medicine Rises

The Chinese medicine market is now facing rising transportation costs and increased foreign costs. In addition, the purchase prices in the producing areas are rising step by step. Hankou and Ganzhou have been lacking in arrivals for a long time. The price in Hankou has risen, and the stock in Shanghai is empty. The supply is unbalanced, and the market price is rising steadily. The opening and transaction prices of Xixidangshen are: Kuilu 400,000, Tulv 360,000, and Gonglu 320,000. The price of Ximian Top was also raised to 320,000. Xiang's producing areas are short of goods, and it is difficult to purchase them. Hunters are hoarding goods, and Taiwan and foreign countries have a sharp increase in access. The price of Mao Xiang has soared to 26 million, creating an unprecedented high price. The refining and cleaning process consumes a lot of money, so the prices of Jue Xiang with the names of "Yi", "Quan", and "Du" have to follow suit, rising to as high as 72 million. It is said that there is still a lot of profit.

### The Cotton Industry Pays Attention to the Detailed Rules of Management; It Is Decided to Convene a General Meeting to Discuss Countermeasures

[This newspaper] The Six District Cotton Textile Association convened a standing council meeting yesterday. In addition to reporting to Chairman Yuan of the Yarn Management Committee for requesting the Jingwo outside, each director saw the published official announcement of the Yarn Management Committee, the detailed rules for the implementation of the unified purchase of cotton and the registration method of cotton yarn. The emotions were immediately tense. The reason is that the directors requested Chairman Yuan on the 27th to postpone the publication of the detailed rules for implementation. The directors did not know the details of the detailed rules and had no way to prepare. Once the publication and implementation are announced, it will inevitably be difficult to implement. The announcement came out immediately after the request was made, which is a great regret. Moreover, according to the cotton yarn registration method, the cotton yarn in each factory cannot be moved from the 29th of this month, which is equivalent to freezing it. It is even more inappropriate to increase the difficulty of capital turnover in each factory at the end of the lunar year. After discussion, it was decided to convene an extraordinary general meeting of all members on the afternoon of the 29th to discuss countermeasures for the industry.

[Another report] The standing directors of the Six District Cotton Textile Association visited Chairman Yuan of the Yarn Management Committee again at around 4 pm yesterday to reiterate the opinions of the industry and request the Yarn Management Committee to pay attention to the opinions of the yarn factory industry and give them consideration. Do not make it impossible to implement after the announcement of the detailed rules for implementation. It is heard that Chairman Yuan was quite moved and was willing to give it further consideration.

### The Allocation Price Remains Unchanged; The Sales Are Sluggish; Cotton Yarn Continues to Weaken

The Cloth Opens Small and Then Recovers Firmly

Yesterday, in the analysis of the yarn market, the Textile Construction Company opened yarn as usual. The allocation price did not change, the sales were very sluggish, the foreign merchants' appetite was weak, and the local street also lacked improvement. Moreover, the Yarn Management Committee held registration, and people's hearts were softening. Many long positions were closed. Until the end, the price of 42 blue phoenix fine yarn fell by 300,000 compared with the previous day, at 58 million yuan. The prices of other coarse and fine yarns also continued to fall by 350,000 to 1 million yuan.

[This newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 464 pieces, and 603 pieces of 20-count yarn. The selling price of 20-count Golden Rooster yarn was still 34.75 million yuan.

Yesterday, the cloth market opened with small gains. Because the cotton yarn was being registered, people's hearts were extremely soft, and the countertop was also very strong. The low price of dragon head fine cloth was 1.57 million yuan, and the low price of Five Blessings was 1.245 million yuan. There were a few transactions. After 10 o'clock, it was heard that the Hankou gang had news of waiting for ships to rush to load, and the buying appetite in the market turned stronger. The yarn and flower gangs also came to sell yarn and buy cloth to do hedge transactions. The floating air groups rose to make up for the losses, and the market recovered again. In the end, the price of each grade of 12-pound fine cloth rose by 45,000 to 156,000 yuan compared with the previous day. The direct purchase price of serge also rose by 10,000 to 30,000 yuan. The footing of other cloths seemed to be quite strong.

Raw Cotton Continues to Weaken

Yesterday, the standard cotton market turned weak. Due to the weakness of yarn and cloth, people's hearts were depressed, and buyers were waiting and watching. Yarn factories were absorbing at low prices, and transactions were slightly expanded. The Textile Construction Company had not yet opened the price, and the transactions between the industry were therefore silent. 220 bales were traded yesterday, and the closing price of the Guan Factory was 5,428,000 for the three-odd Zhen, 5,374,000 for the Han fine, and the closing price of the Jian giao was 5,374,000 for the Han fine, 5,870,000 for Shashi, and 1,220,000 to 1,230,000 for Zhoupu seed flower.

Woolen Cloth Is Deserted

Yesterday, in the Chang Le Teahouse, Qipan Street and Xie Da Zhengyu and other large wholesalers, woolen cloth transactions in and out were deserted. Because the business of both the local street and the foreign gang was mostly lagging, the buyers were making steady and steady profits, which led to the rare sales and the price turned mostly flat. Yesterday, the white-edged Maiden was sold for 1.25 million yuan per yard, and the local-edged Maiden was sold for 850,000 yuan. The various firms in the industry felt bored early, and the transactions were clear.

### Cigarettes and Soap Are Stable

Yesterday, the cigarette market opened stable. It was then heard that the tax procedures of the Yizhong Company had not been completed, and the distribution of goods was expected to be delayed until the 2nd of next month. The local street was eager to make up for the losses, and the trading was even more prosperous in the afternoon, and the market rose step by step. As a result, the price of ten British Old Knife two cigarettes rose by 500,000 to 550,000 yuan compared with the previous day, and the prices of other Chinese and foreign cigarettes also rose.

In the daily necessities and soap market, the market atmosphere was weak in the morning due to the sale of recycled Arrow Knife soap. In the afternoon, as the monetary policy tended to be loose, the internal and external purchases of the industry rose, and the final price of solidified soap rose by 25,000 yuan compared with the previous day, and the price of arrow knife rose by a small amount of 20,000 yuan. Xiangmao Niupai also rose by 12,000. Guanghua Beauty and others were stable. The sales of matches and miscellaneous brands were relatively booming, and the prices rose by 120,000 yuan.

### On the Issue of Overseas Remittances from Siam (Thailand)

â€” Xu Zuoren

The figures for overseas remittances from Siam over the years have not yet been officially tallied, but are estimated to be over 20 million yuan in gold. The total amount of overseas remittances from Siam last year and for each month of the past year are listed below, based on statistics from the Bangkok Chinese Yuan Bao newspaper:

According to the table above, we can see that the largest amount of remittances in national currency (Guobi) last year was in July, totaling 11.1 billion yuan, and the smallest was in January, at just 1.11 billion yuan. In terms of Siamese currency (baht), February saw the most remittances, totaling over 64 million baht, while December had the least, just over 12 million baht. (This figure is a half-month statistic; the total for the full month should be more than this.) Looking at the full-year figures for overseas remittances, the amount in national currency is gradually increasing, but when viewed in terms of Siamese currency, it is trending downward. In particular, August saw a sharp drop from over 56 million baht in the previous month to just over 19 million baht, a decrease of almost two-fold. There are two main reasons for this gradual decrease in remittances from Siam:

First: Due to the instability of the national currency's value. As shown in the table above, the exchange rate from January to December declines like a staircase, with a forty-fold drop between January and December. Upon closer inspection, the rapid decline resembles "walking a tightrope," constantly swaying. As a result, although the national currency was declining earlier, overseas Chinese were reluctant to lose out of patriotism, so each drop stimulated excitement about remittances. However, like the surging Yangtze River, it was gone and unrecoverable. Once the hope of recovery was dashed, enthusiasm cooled considerably. Those who previously did not want to miss out on initial declines now have the experience that "there is no end to the decline" and have adopted an unconditionally bearish attitude. The gradual decrease in remittances is therefore to be expected.

Second: Due to speculation on remittances. Because remittances cannot be directly transferred domestically by our country's banks and are mostly handled by private remittance agencies, and because the currency value is declining daily, this has led to speculation by remittance agencies paying for overseas remittances. They often compete by absorbing remittance drafts at lower prices. The total amount of remittances from January to July last year was approximately 320 million baht, accounting for three-quarters of the total for the year, while remittances from August to December totaled just over 90 million baht; this is due to the prevalence of speculation on remittances before July. In particular, the record high in July, ranking second for the year, was due to the impact of speculation. Also, because the remittance amount in July was exceptionally high, subsequent months appeared even more sluggish. The economic capacity of overseas Chinese is limited, except for a few with more assets who have no problems raising funds. Because Julyâ€™s intake was too much, it could not be replenished instantly after July, so regardless of how "low Kang" the exchange rate was in September and October, the amount of remittances continued to decline.

### Review of Seven Post-War Published Educational Maps

â€” Liu Gao

The struggle for territory is often an important cause of war. Even wars that do not arise from territorial disputes often end with territorial concessions. Therefore, almost every war changes the face of the map. The changes in the borders of China and other major participating countries in this World War are so great that pre-war geography books and maps must be significantly revised. However, many of the geography textbooks published by various bookstores in our country after the war have been substantially revised or only slightly modified, and their content is more inconsistent with the post-war situation than the pre-war versions. Only newly published maps have mostly been redrawn entirely. After careful reading, the content is far from satisfactory. The sixteen-page maps of China and foreign countries seen by the reviewer are as follows:

1. Yang Jingxiong et al.: Latest Provincial Map of the Republic of China (Huan Cheng Publishing House)

2. Jin Qingyu: China Geography Textbook Map (Da Zhongguo Bookstore)

3. Chen Duo et al.: China Geography Textbook Map (Nan Wu)

4. Wang Chengzong et al.: New China Provincial Map (New China Publishing House)

5. Jin Qingyu: World Geography Textbook Map (Da Zhongguo Bookstore)

6. Qiu Zumou et al.: New World Atlas (New China Publishing House)

7. Chen Duo et al.: World Geography Textbook Map (Commercial Press)

In addition, Da Zhongguo Bookstore also has China Provincial News and New World National Maps, whose content is the same as the above-mentioned maps 2 and 5. There are also many pocket editions published by other bookstores, all of which are omitted. The reviewer does not intend to check the small errors in each map, such as incorrect locations and incorrect place names, but only points out the inappropriate compilation styles and more serious errors. The following statements apply to the shortcomings shared by all maps unless otherwise specified.

Layered Colors

Since the publication of the China Map (Shen Bao Guan) by Ding Wenjiang et al. in the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), the method of drawing maps by dividing layers with contour lines has become a fashion. Over the past ten years, most of the maps published in our country have been drawn using this method. However, the contour lines drawn are mostly thick brown lines with deep colors. In provinces or countries with mountainous terrain, there must be many contour lines. Therefore, contour lines have become the most eye-catching feature in the maps of mountainous provinces or countries. The maps of these provinces or countries appear blurred and difficult to read, which can be said to be a major shortcoming. The contour lines in the map by Ding Wenjiang et al., which was the first to be drawn using this method, are extremely thin black dashed lines, without this shortcoming. The reviewer believes that since layers have already been divided and colored, then even these thin dashed lines can be removed, because a line is naturally formed between two different colors.

Villages and Town Names

Each provincial division of the Chinese maps listed above, at least in part, not only depicts county towns but also cities larger than counties, as well as many villages and towns. The trend of adding small place names below the county level to middle school textbook maps seems to have started in the early days of the War of Resistance. At that time, small place names often appeared in war news, and people could not obtain detailed maps except by consulting middle school textbook maps. Therefore, publishers of middle school maps competed with each other for having small place names in their maps. However, during wartime, due to the relationship between the location and the terrain, fierce battles could take place even in a three-household village, and its place name could appear in the headline of a newspaper. When reading war news, sometimes even the most detailed maps secretly kept by military agencies are not enough. A map should be in accordance with the situation. For those labeled for middle school teaching, it is enough to draw only county towns and a few small place names of special importance. If you want more detail, you must increase the version size. It is not appropriate to add small place names without restriction in a small version, which increases the difficulty of reading. Among the above-mentioned Chinese maps, Jin Qingyu's China Geography Textbook Map is better in terms of drawing, but it also has the most small place names, especially the Sichuan Province map, which is particularly difficult to read and can be said to be a major shortcoming.

New National Borders

The only thing that the world maps published in our country after the war are better than those published before the war is that they have the new national borders after the war. Other changes besides the national borders are not included, which makes the revisions seem too few. The Soviet Union was composed of ten one Soviet Socialist Republics before the Great War, but after the war, it has increased to sixteen republics. The five newly added republics are all in the west. In addition to drawing the new borders of the Soviet Union, the three world maps listed above still preserve part of the old borders and the boundary lines between the republics. The Jin and Chen world maps both cancel the boundary line between Lithuania and East Prussia. Although the two maps agree on this point unintentionally, they are baseless and lead to errors. After the northern part of East Prussia belongs to the Soviet Union, it isåŠƒinto the Russian Republic and notåŠƒinto Lithuania. The reviewer believes that errors are better than omissions. The authors of the three maps do not know how the new territories of the Soviet Union are divided. They should know that the boundary lines between the old republics must already be inaccurate, and it is better to omit them when drawing the maps. There have also been major changes in the boundary lines of provinces and regions within the Russian Republic. Many of the Soviet city names have been newly changed, but the three maps listed above have not been modified. (The boundary lines between the Soviet republics and provinces and regions cannot be explained in a few words. Last spring, new world maps were published abroad with the latest national borders and political divisions. Last summer, Shanghai had them for sale.)

Self-Governing Dominions

Before World War I, the United Kingdom had five self-governing dominions, one of which was Newfoundland. Shortly after World War I (1922), the Irish Free State was established, increasing the number of self-governing dominions to six. The following year (1923), Southern Rhodesia in South Africa was changed from a directly-governed colony to a self-governing dominion, bringing the total to seven self-governing dominions. In 1933, Newfoundland requested to be changed to a directly-governed colony due to financial difficulties, leaving only six self-governing dominions. There have been more increases since World War II. As far as the reviewer knows, all books and maps published in the country over the past twenty years have not been corrected, and they all say that the United Kingdom has five self-governing dominions and that one of them is Newfoundland, which is quite strange. The three world maps listed above have not been corrected either, treating the situation before World War I as the current situation after World War II, which is disappointing.

Level of Detail

World maps published in our country often have simplified depictions of South America, Africa, and Oceania, with only one map for each continent. Europe and North America, in addition to the full continental maps, always have separate maps. The reviewer believes that some small countries in Europe and North America are not larger or more important than the countries in South America, Africa, and Oceania. Their maps can already be seen in the full continental maps, and there is no need for separate maps. The national defense map of China in Jin Qingyu's China map has nothing related to national defense other than provincial borders, national borders, highways, and railways. Provincial and national borders can already be seen on the political map, and highways and railways can already be seen on the transportation map. This so-called "national defense map" is completely meaningless and should be deleted to save space. Otherwise, the content must be enriched to make it worthy of the name.

Attached Explanations

The seven maps listed above all have more than fifty or sixty pages of explanations. However, Yang Jingxiong et al.'s Latest Provincial Map of the Republic of China has a gazetteer. Each school has separate geography textbooks when teaching, and teachers and students seem to rarely read the map explanations. And the place names in geography textbooks cannot be annotated with detailed locations. Smaller place names are difficult to find without a gazetteer. The reviewer believes that a map can be without explanations, but it cannot be without a gazetteer.

The seven maps listed above each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Among them, Qiu Zumou et al.'s New World Atlas, Chen Duo et al.'s World Geography Textbook Map, and Wang Chengzong's New China Provincial Map are relatively poor. Wang Chengzong's map was published at the end of September of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946). If the reviewer's guess is correct, this map was originally intended to be published before the start of the school year in September of the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), and the drawing was started too late. Therefore, it was hastily completed in a short time, and there are many omissions. The national soil map is so wrong that it is useless. The draftsman did not read the instructions, and the instructions written and the attached instructions are inconsistent with each other. The new national borders drawn in Qiu Zumou et al.'s New World Map Collection are erroneous and incomplete. Chen Duo et al.'s World Geography Textbook Map is not actually newly drawn, but only the old map has the new national borders added in red money, which is also incomplete. As mentioned above, the only advantage of the world maps published in our country after the war is that they have new national borders. Qiu and Chen's maps do not even have this only advantage.

The four Chinese maps listed above are, on the whole, not as good as Ding Wenjiang et al.'s New Provincial Map of China (Shen Bao Guan) published before the war. The three world maps listed above are also not as good as Tan Lian's Latest World Atlas (Commercial Press) before the war. The eight-year War of Resistance has obviously regressed our country in many ways, and it has not been able to restore its original level more than two years after the victory. Maps can be said to be one aspect of it.

### Introduction to "The Reconstruction of Chinese Agriculture"

â€” Mu Yun

Author: Luo Jun Price: NT$200

Published by: Taiwan Sugar Corporation Sugarcane Research Institute

The author, Dr. Luo Jun, specializes in sugarcane. After graduating from Jinling University in Nanjing at an early age, he returned to Guangxi in the south to engage in practical agricultural work, delving into the hinterland of the province to investigate specialty crops. He also used tractors to cultivate 10,000 mu of wasteland in Shibei Peng, Liucheng County, to plant sugarcane, which was one of the earliest large-scale experiments in mechanized agriculture in our country. In the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), he presided over agricultural affairs at the Guixian Sugar Factory, which was well-known in the sugarcane industry in our country. In the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), he went to Louisiana State University in the United States for further study, specializing in sugarcane pathology. He returned to China in the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941) and taught at Fujian Agricultural College and Guangxi University until the end of the War of Resistance. After the restoration of Taiwan, he returned to the sugarcane industry and served as the director of the Sugarcane Research Institute of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. "The Reconstruction of Chinese Agriculture" is the author's reflection on China's agricultural policy over the years.

Regarding Chinese agriculture, the author believes that the self-sufficient agricultural management model must end. Farmers are still people, and farmers also need to live a human life. After the destruction of China's self-sufficient agricultural society by the commodity economy, the income from self-sufficient agricultural management is meager, and farmers' annual income is very small. Unless the way farmers manage their farms is changed, it will be impossible to improve the lives of farmers, who account for 80% of China's population. This also means that it is impossible to improve the living standards of the Chinese people.

China must become an industrialized country, and self-sufficient farm management is an obstacle to industrialization. It divides social production into countless small production units, and each production unit is surrounded by a layer of insulation, preventing the concentration of production and suffocating the lifeline of low-priced supply of industrial raw materials.

Agricultural finance, like industrial management, cannot lose money. If managing agriculture does not even pay wages, no one will want to manage it. Self-sufficient agricultural management is a production method that does not calculate costs, does not ask for profits, and has the least effect. In a self-sufficient society with barter, farmers can exchange their products for agricultural products they do not have, which is enough for them to survive. However, if they exchange them for industrial products and daily necessities, they can exchange very little, which is the reason for the low purchasing power of Chinese rural areas. We believe that the only way to improve the living standards of the majority of farmers and increase the purchasing power of rural areas in China today is to change agricultural management, turning unprofitable agricultural management into profitable agricultural management, which is what the author refers to as enterprise farming.

Enterprise farming requires first geography and second technology. The author advocates developing local specialties on the spot, that is, taking advantage of the situation and making a start, and then consolidating the foundation of production technology with the assistance of government technical personnel. When enterprises prosper, profits can be used to increase research funds and use enterprise profits to improve the production methods of the industry, so that the enterprise will be invincible over time.

Enterprise agriculture must have an environment that can prosper, and the responsibility for opening up and arranging this environment rests with the state. We believe that the government should have priorities, and indomitable confidence in building new enterprise agriculture, first developing transportation to facilitate transportation and reduce production costs; then building dams and dredging rivers to ensure the safety and stability of production volume; and then controlling the prices of agricultural products and preventing the tragic drop in agricultural product prices, and sharing the losses of disasters byæ¶ˆå£°è€…, so that production andæ¶ˆå£°form a whole, so that the losses caused to farmers by natural disasters and man-made disasters can be reduced to a minimum.

The backbone of enterprise farming is the knowledge of the producers. Enterprise farmers must not only have production technology, but also need to have common sense of sales, storage, and refining. All of this cannot be done by illiterate people. China wants to develop a new agricultural gold industry, and she has the power to carry out nine years of compulsory education, so that agricultural producers have the intellectual level of junior high school and become farmers in the scientific age.

The book is divided into ten chapters: Chapter 1, China enters the era of enterprise morning industry. Chapter 2, The Improvement of Chinese Morning Industry and Its Obstacles. Chapter 3, Basic Understanding of Building a New Agriculture. Chapter 4, Establishment of a New Agricultural Zone in China. Chapter 5, The Driving Force of Agricultural Construction. Chapter 6, The Dependence of New Agricultural Enterprises on People's Livelihood Industries. Chapter 7, The Guarantee System of Enterprise Agriculture. Chapter 8, The Road to Agricultural Science in China. Chapter 9, The Responsibility of the Government. Chapter 10, A Theatrical Example.

Overall, the book's arguments are precise, its insights are unique, and it is a book worth introducing to readers who are concerned about the future of Chinese agriculture.

### After Reading "Sensation Psychology"

â€” Zuo Renxia

Written by Zhang Yaoxiang Published by Commercial Press Price: Six Yuan

Since the victory of the War of Resistance, the famous works on the psychology of sensation that I have had the opportunity to read are: one is Perception and Cognition by Professor Boring of Harvard University in the United States (first edition in 1942); the second is Sensory Theory by Professor PiÃ©ron of the University of Paris (1946 edition); and the third is Sensation Psychology, a recent work by Zhang Yaoxiang, a senior figure in the Chinese psychology field. Boring's argument focuses on the historical system; PiÃ©ron's point of view focuses only on physiological phenomena. As for Zhang's writings, they collect all the facts of psychological experiments, engage in deep exploration, and use clear words and fluent writing to compile a special collection to guide future generations. It is necessary to introduce it first.

The original book is divided into nine chapters. The first chapter is an overview: a general discussion of the common properties of sensation, and also involves issues such as the classification of sensation. Chapter 2 discusses cutaneous sensation: in addition to discussing general properties, it also discusses complex sensations such as hard, smooth, blunt, wet, sticky, and itchy. Chapter 3 discusses olfaction: this chapter has unique insights into topics such as olfactory preference and art. Chapter 4 discusses gustation: there are also novel discoveries about taste preference and art. Chapter 5 discusses the sense of hearing: this chapter is essential scientific information for those who study music. Chapter 6 discusses the sense of sight: this chapter discusses the theory of color and the psychology of color appreciation in detail, and is especially a good work that those engaged in äº‹ should have on hand. Chapter 7 discusses kinesthetic sensation: in addition to general discussions, there are also discussions on complex sensations such as effort, friction, movement, and direction. Chapter 8 discusses interoception: in addition to general discussions, it also provides reasonable explanations for nausea, colic, childbirth, and sexual sensation. Chapter 9 discusses animal sensation: this chapter is the most lacking in domestic heart regulation literature, and I am very happy that the author has made an interesting supplement to this.

In terms of the whole book, its characteristics that are worthy of special mention are approximately the following teaching points:

General psychological writings often focus on principles and ignore facts, while this book focuses on the concrete facts of psychology, in contrast to principles. Therefore, some "Mr. So-and-so's law, Mr. So-and-so's principle" that have been praised by the world are often not invited to be included.

This book discusses sensation not only in humans, but also in animals, and there is a special chapter discussing it; this is undoubtedly a stimulant for the Chinese psychology field, which is still neglecting animal psychology research.

Most of the psychological writings published in China are due to the unassimilated swallowing of foreigners' writings, so the text often cannot convey its meaning, causing readers to become tired. The author of this book is able to express profound meanings with fluent writing, so that readers do not feel the dryness of science, but only the appreciation of literature and art.

Most of the psychology circles in our country only understand imported psychology; but the psychological wisdom accumulated in Chinese studies has never been consulted. The author of this book is proficient in both Chinese and Western learning, so his writings often cite extensively. Gao Lian of the Ming Dynasty's discussion of incense and Zheng Fuguan of the Qing Dynasty's discussion of color are all examples developed by the author.

Zhang's psychology of sensation is part of his planned compendium of central psychology, of which the introduction, sensation, and emotion articles have been published in separate volumes one after another, and the rest are waiting to be published. According to the world, psychology giants like "Integrated" are all written by a large number of psychologists. Apart from Ribot, the hero who wrote "Integrated" by himself is still a rare sight like Zhang's.

Finally, I originally planned to say a few words of criticism to achieve the effect of seeking completeness, but I occasionally thought of committing the suspicion of "small scolding is a big praise"; and the true price of this book is there, there is no need to talk too much, it is better to stop here.

### Translation Examples

â€” Zhong Huan

(Compiled by Su Zhaolong Published by Jingwen Bookstore)

Jingwen Bookstore has indeed made great efforts in publishing English books. Most of the books it publishes are suitable for middle school students. They are divided into research and practical types, and "both reading materials and reference books are equally important." This "Translation Examples" is a good reference book.

The translation work of Mr. Su Zhaolong, the author of Translation Examples, has always been admired by everyone. We can know that this is a good book for a translator like Mr. Su to write this small "Translation Examples." This book has been proofread and corrected by Mr. Ge Chuanrong.

This book is divided into two major categories for research: English to Chinese and Chinese to English. It is divided into four parts: The first part and the second part include examples of "sentence translation." The first part is English to Chinese, and the second part is Chinese to English. Each example sentence has two or more translations, so that scholars can use it flexibly. Every ten example sentences are attached with an exercise, totaling one hundred and twenty example sentences and twelve exercises. The third and fourth parts include examples of "paragraph translation." The third part is English to Chinese, and the fourth part is Chinese to English. Each paragraph is followed by comments. The good ones explain their advantages, and the bad ones are corrected, so that scholars can try to translate themselves before reading the translation, and then compare it with the comments, which will make progress faster. There are a total of sixty articles, each with an exercise attached to every five articles. As for the themes, they are mostly selected from European and American masterpieces and the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Ancient and Modern Wonders, which can arouse interest.

Translation is a tool for communicating Eastern and Western cultures. It is the most important and most difficult part of English, and there have always been very few reference books on translation. This time, I was fortunate enough to find this Translation Examples and introduce it in particular.

### Wen Tung English Primer

â€” Ge Chenxun

The Wen Tung English Course Primer, Volumes One and Two, compiled by Lu Dianyang, first edition published by Wen Tung Bookstore in February of the 36th year of the Republic.

This is an elementary English textbook, just as its name suggests, specifically for those who are beginning to learn English. The most elementary English teaching materials are the most difficult to compile. It is not easy to compile materials suitable for teaching without a very deep understanding of English language and literature and rich experience in English teaching. This is a fact generally recognized by teachers.

Elementary school Chinese language textbooks often have only a few words per lesson. They seem extremely easy, but truly well-compiled textbooks are few and far between. This is because the fewer the words used, the higher the level of skill required for compilation. People often have high aspirations but low abilities, capable only of criticism and unable to compile themselves. If that's the case even for Chinese language textbooks, one can imagine how difficult it is for elementary English textbooks. Therefore, for decades, there have been very few excellent elementary English textbooks published in the market.

In English-speaking countries like England and the United States, textbooks used for children often have what is called a Primer PrePrimer before the first volume, with few words, so that children can have adequate preparation before formally learning a language. The famous British The Oxford English Course has a Primer volume, and the American Learning to Read, published in 1945, has two volumes: Pre-primer 1-Bill and Susen and Pre-primer 2-Under the Tree. Most other books are like this as well.

The Wen Tung English Primer is a Primer, and its compilation is very similar to the British style, which is more formal. It is extremely suitable for use as an elementary school English textbook. Elementary school children in our country are originally allowed to study English when local needs require it. It is said that the Ministry of Education's recently revised but not yet announced elementary school curriculum standards also allow various regions to select foreign languages if needed. Elementary school children in places such as Shanghai and Guangzhou have always had optional English classes, so there is a real need for English textbooks suitable for elementary teaching.

According to learning psychology, it is better for children to learn a foreign language at a younger age. It is not easy to succeed if they are too old. It is a very common and significant phenomenon that older students in junior high school often do not perform as well in English as younger students. Originally, language is not a knowledge discipline, but a skill, like typing, playing the piano, swimming, or playing ball, and it must go through countless repetitions of learning before it can be used skillfully and naturally. This kind of repeated practice is most effective when applied to young children. The older they get, the more they like to use reason and comparative study, and they are unwilling to imitate and repeat the exercises like young children. This is most detrimental to learning a foreign language. Therefore, if elementary school children select English, they can easily succeed if the teacher is good and the teaching materials are good. And it does not hinder the learning of other subjects at all.

Speaking of teaching materials, elementary schools generally use junior high school English textbooks. The physical and mental development of junior high school students is different from that of elementary school children. The progress of junior high school English is very fast, and the content is not suitable for elementary school children. Some elementary schools use foreign elementary school textbooks, but the living habits of foreign children seem unfamiliar to Chinese children. Even with good teachers, the lack of good teaching materials ultimately makes it impossible to achieve significant teaching results.

The Wen Tung English Primer, in terms of level, is suitable for fifth and sixth graders in elementary school; children over the age of ten will definitely find it easy to learn. After learning the Primer, they can lay a foundation in English, and in the future, when they go on to learn junior high school English, they can achieve twice the result with half the effort.

The compilation of the entire book is very thoughtful. The two volumes have forty lessons, with about 150 new words. The first volume has only 64 words, and the second volume has only 85 words. The restrictions are extremely strict, and the repetitions are extremely numerous, which is very much in line with the psychology of language learning. In addition to the text, each disc has listening, speaking and other exercises in the first volume, and command, question-and-answer and other exercises in the second volume. Repeated changes make it a habit; each volume also has writing exercises, arranged in a scientific way from simple strokes to familiar words and sentences. Every four or six lessons form a unit, and the content is consistent. After each unit, there are various tests: multiple choice, fill-in-the-blanks, silent listening, question-and-answer, true or false, etc., mostly represented by pictures, which can increase interest. Using this book, the teaching situation will be very lively.

I love to read its texts the most. The progression of the texts is natural and lively, and the sentences used are all used in daily life. It is not difficult to teach this kind of text in a class of fifty children. I know that many elementary school teachers in Shanghai are choosing a good English textbook to make it easier for their children to learn, so I am happy to introduce this Wen Tung English Primer.

The compiler of the Wen Tung English Primer, Mr. Lu Dianyang, has served as an English professor at National Southeast University and National Zhejiang University, training English teachers, and has done a lot of research on English teaching, and has written many works, which I think readers are well aware of. After the war, he felt the pain of Shanghai elementary schools not having suitable teaching materials for optional English classes, so he compiled this book to meet the needs. He used great effort to compile this book, which can be seen from the overall structure, organization, and vocabulary.

There is one shortcoming in this book. The illustrations in both volumes are all in black, which inevitably detracts from the children's love of learning. If this Wen Tung English Primer were to have all color illustrations, like the American Learning to Read, it would be even more irresistible. We hope that within the possible scope of material production conditions, printing technology will be gradually improved, and the Wen Tung English Primer will become the most perfect English textbook in the country.

### A Judge's Story

â€” Shao Xunmei

Book title: The Judge's Story p.218 Author: Charles Morgan Publisher: Macmillan & Co London Price: Seven shillings and sixpence

Charles Morgan indeed occupies a special position in the British literary world. He has published five novels in total, and he has won the three most important literary awards in England. Each time he publishes a work, it always attracts everyone's serious attention and sells quite well, but some people often feel that it is difficult to read, but everyone admits that he is a first-class contemporary British writer.

Originally, since George Moore's death in 1931, many writers have wanted to inherit his two titles of "Master of Prose" and "Master of Storytelling." The most likely candidate was Somerset Maugham. His reputation, status, and achievements have been recognized by the world, but some people still criticize him for not being serious enough. There is also Aldous Huxley, but unfortunately his interest in philosophy, politics, and religion is as strong as his interest in literature; his novels, especially his recent works, often give you a confusing and complex feeling. In addition, there are two contestants who are orthodox disciples of George Moore. One is David Garnett, and the other is Morgan.

Garnett seems to be the youngest. His novel "Lady into Fox" won two literary awards at the same time. The literary world placed great hope on him. However, his later works, in order to excessively develop his talent for telling stories, rendered the simplest themes complex and vivid; because the basic story was too ordinary, in the end, the reader felt that his spirit was wasted, as if he had used all his heart and mind but received no reward.

We all know that George Moore's writing style has reached a state of perfection, as pure as an angel and as vivid as a spring. Although it has been revised and modified many times, it is natural without any trace. He also knows how to choose themes to match his writing style. His memoirs about the Irish literary movement have become a permanent monument in the British literary circle.

Morgan tells mostly modern stories. His writing style is too deeply influenced by George Moore, and there is a suspicion of deliberately showing off. This phenomenon is most obvious in "Sparkenbroke," so this novel is also the most unsuccessful. Of course, he himself also understands the foolishness of this style. To worship a hero does not necessarily mean abandoning one's own personality. "The Voyage," published in 1941, gradually moved away from this path. "The Judge's Story," which was recently published, can be said to be completely his own style.

"The Judge's Story" is not long. The entire book is only two hundred and eighteen pages, but it is as exquisite as a Keats' sonnet. The story has a whole philosophy, a perfect structure; the characters' personalities are all active in front of a real background; and the concise and intimate writing style appropriately matches the speed of the story's progress. This is a typical British work because only they have that leisurely abundance, rigorous temperament, and tenacious will. This work does not hope to exchange for a large amount of American dollars, but is striving for an immortal status. As the title of the book suggests, this novel tells the story of a retired judge. He has a pure personality, or a perfect soul. After resigning, he lives a clean and normal life. He plans to write a historical record of the lives of "virtuous people," and spends most of his time collecting and organizing materials. Opposing him is a wealthy industrial magnate, who has almost no personality or soul to speak of, so he is satisfied with destroying other people's personalities or souls. He wants to seduce those so-called "good people" into falling into depravity, and then try his best to rescue them from the trap, so that they can live again in gratitude to him, completely obeying his commands and arrangements. This is a devilish identity in the Bible. The judge has an adopted daughter. She is smart and beautiful. However, because she is overly active, she seems to have more than one personality or soul; driven by the environment and emotions, she will change her nature and color at any time. If it were not for the judge's hints and actions, she would almost let that industrialist grasp her soul. Her husband is also a "good person." He also has a personality or soul, but they are not obvious enough or complete enough. The industrialist does not think he is worth seducing, except that he may have a considerable influence on his wife. These different personalities are the backbone of this story.

In short, this novel is indeed rare in the modern publishing world, where commercial influence is extremely common. However, I always think that the atmosphere of philosophy and psychology is too heavy. If it were Maugham, he would let the story progress to explain everything, completely avoiding dry discussions and analysis.

### The Road of Intellectuals

â€” Jingwen

The group of people who used to be called the scholar-official class and are now called intellectuals can be said to be the most suffering in modern society. People used to joke about scholar-officials with the saying, "A scholar's rebellion will not succeed in three years." Today, "A scholar is useless" has long become a footnote to the fate of all intellectuals.

However, a society without intellectuals is simply unimaginable. Especially in modern society, the word intellectual is not limited to so-called scholars. Anyone who belongs to the middle social class can be said to be an intellectual. What Europeans and Americans call the white-collar class, what we call the salaried class, and so-called freelancers are all the backbone of the intellectual class.

Since the theory of class struggle was first proposed, some people have not believed in the possibility of a so-called middle social class existing in this world, believing that there are no other social classes besides the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Although there is a so-called petty bourgeoisie, its position is uncertain. It may be a "hanger-on" of the bourgeoisie, or it may be a "fellow traveler" of the proletariat.

This statement seems to make some sense at first glance because there are indeed many "helpers" who are either left-leaning or right-leaning among the so-called petty bourgeoisie. But we cannot deny a major fact because of this, that is, the middle social class has its own independent existence and strength, and is the leading force in all forms of society. Regardless of what kind of system a country or a society adopts for its economic life, the existence of the middle social class always plays a leading role.

This is not an exaggeration. When it comes to capitalist countries, Britain and the United States are of course representatives, but the pillars that make up British and American society are definitely not a few capitalists, but middle-class people who make up the absolute majority. The working class in British and American society naturally ranks first in terms of numbers, but their spiritual yearning is still centered on the middle-class society.

The Soviet Union was the first country to experiment with the so-called proletarian revolution, but the backbone of today's Soviet society is still the middle social class, with intellectuals as the leading center. Moreover, the Soviet Union's founding policy, in the final analysis, is nothing more than wanting to establish a country with the petty bourgeois class as its common foundation. The so-called proletarian dictatorship is just a political means used by some intellectuals to appeal to the masses. May I ask, which of Marx, Lenin, or even Stalin, was truly born into the so-called proletariat?

Isn't the situation in our country the same? Although many people look down on a long gown, how many people who wear a long gown are willing to take it off resolutely? And how many of those who have not yet worn a long gown are secretly hoping that they or their children will wear a long gown? Many people who work hard to make a living, usually save money on food and clothing, is his hope only in the four boards behind him? Definitely not, he wants to use his bare hands to climb up to the upper class of society, and what he considers to be the upper class in his mind is precisely the middle social class that everyone despises now, with intellectuals as the social backbone. The symbol of that is a long gown.

The saying that a scholar's rebellion will not succeed in three years may be used to mock some "reading officials," but it definitely cannot be applied to the broad intellectual class. May I ask, which major movement in ancient and modern history, at home and abroad, did not come from the promotion and leadership of intellectuals? And the stabilizing force of modern society belongs to the intellectual class.

The purpose of this short article is not to call for "rescuing intellectuals." Since intellectuals are the leading force in society, there is no need to call for rescue. Although the middle-class people in modern countries are suffering from the heavy pressure of life, there is no object to call for, and there can be no effect. The way out for intellectuals today or in the future is not to lean left or right, but to be able to firmly believe that they are the mainstay of society, uphold the belief of social justice, and become a stabilizing force to consolidate society in troubled times.

### Winter Vacation

â€” Mang

Almost every composition in childhood had the words "Time flies like an arrow." Not only was I like this, but many classmates also liked to use these words to start, as if it wouldn't be a good composition without this sentence. In fact, at that time, time did not fly like an arrow. I only hated that the days passed slowly. I couldn't wait for today to pass New Year's Day, and after a while, it would be the end of the twelfth lunar month, because the happiest time was during the New Year.

Now it's different. Instead, I feel that the days are passing too quickly. I clearly remember the situation when I came to school at the beginning of the semester, and now it's time for vacation again. Perhaps there are still many people who think that these few months have passed slowly, but I think that these few months have passed too quickly. Now I deserve to use the words "Time flies like an arrow."

The students all hope that the winter vacation will come soon, so they can go home for the New Year. I only hate having this winter vacation. However, this is a feeling that I only had this semester. In the past, I also had a strong desire for the winter vacation.

Maybe I'm too selfish, thinking that because I don't want to go home for the New Year, I don't want to have a winter vacation. This is true. I hope there is no winter vacation because the winter vacation doesn't give me happiness, it gives me sorrow. Worry about the tuition fees, miscellaneous fees, and meal fees for the next semester...

The winter vacation also gives me distress. When I go back to my home (which is not really my own home), I have to see my father's worried face and hear my mother's sad sighs. Worried faces, sad sighs! When can they turn into happy smiles and joyful cheers?

Walking out of the school gate, I was secretly sad. After walking for a while, I often turned back to look at the neat classrooms. I was reluctant to leave them because I didn't know if I could be with them again in a month.

How annoying the winter vacation is!

### A Worthy Opponent

â€” Lei Hong

There was a Quaker merchant who loaded a ship with goods in the old days of sailing ships and transported them to other ports. He hadn't received news of arrival for a long time, so he thought it had been lost. The merchant went to another friend, Jones, who was also a Quaker and an insurance broker. He asked Jones to insure the ship and was willing to pay a high premium.

The insurance broker thought for a while and said to the merchant, "Friend, please write down the details and let me take them back and consider them overnight. I'll give you an answer tomorrow." The merchant wrote a note and left.

That night, the merchant received bad news that the ship had indeed been lost. He didn't know if Jones had already decided to accept this insurance business. He turned the matter over in his mind all night. If he had already signed the note, he could get insurance compensationâ€”if he hadn't signed, everything would be over.

So, early the next morning, he wrote a note and sent it to the insurance broker's office, which read: "To my brother Jones: I have learned that the ship is safe. Regarding the matter I begged you to do yesterday, if you have not signed the note, please have the bearer bring it back."

The insurance broker thought the ship was safe. In order to collect the huge insurance premium as soon as possible, he quickly signed the insurance policy and gave it to the messenger to take back.

### On "Officials Don't Repair Government Offices"

â€” Maogong

According to Hu Shi, Xiong Bing argued against "officials not repairing government offices" during his lifetime because he lacked constructive ideas. Regardless of whether the old officials not repairing government offices was truly an expression of a lack of constructive minds, according to my foolish thoughts, officials who do not repair government offices are better than those who do.

The reason is actually simple. The purpose of officials repairing government offices is not necessarily for so-called construction, just as officials riding in cars is not for the convenience of transportation. If an impetuous reporter visits an official who is repairing a government office and asks, "Why do you want to repair your government office?" The most plausible answer would probably be no more than "to enhance the appearance." Enhancing the appearance is certainly not construction, and if it is not construction, it is certainly not worth supporting or endorsing. No, no, because they want to enhance the appearance, they should actually be opposed.

What is called enhancing the appearance? Isn't it just showing off or acting mysteriously? In the imperial era, the palaces and halls of the emperors were built magnificently and beautifully. The intention, in addition to personal enjoyment, was to enhance the appearance, that is, to scare the common people. Who says that the construction of the Afang Palace by a certain emperor and the construction of the Summer Palace by a certain emperor were for construction? The construction cost of the Summer Palace, however, was misappropriated from the funds for building the navy. However, in the era of emperors, "I am the state," and they can do whatever they want. What can we common people say?

What is strange is that the people's servants in democratic countries also like palaces quite a bit. Take the most democratic United States as an example. The president may be a commoner who grew up in a small wooden house, but the president's office must be the magnificent White House (of course, the word "palace" is our translation, and the fault is not theirs). We have probably all used servants, or we will use them one day. Would we put the best room in the house for the servants to live in? I am not very clear about the situation in the United States, but it would not be wrong to say that Mr. Truman's bedroom and study must be more exquisite than the servants'. Today, people in democratic countries are all suffering from a housing shortage, moving houses, and floating houses. No matter how many tricks there are, there are still people sleeping in the open, while their servants are very comfortable in the White House, Black House, and magnificent halls. Is this called a democratic country, the people's century? Are you deceiving people or dogs?

You may say that public servants are different from private servants. Public servants are those who govern the country and pacify the world, and they must be well served, otherwise their spirits will be affected due to material discomfort, and if they mess up the country a little, it will cause disaster to the people. I say that is not the case. First of all, the importance of private servants to us is no less than that of public servants. We tell the cooks to sleep in the stove room. Are we not afraid that their lives will be bad and their spirits will be bad, so they will put arsenic instead of MSG? Secondly, whether public servants work conscientiously and whether they are determined to benefit the country and the people has nothing to do with whether they live in tall buildings. No, no, public servants who want to live in good houses are definitely less conscientious and less determined to save the world than those who do not want to live in good houses. The appointment of public servants is not for earning money like the appointment of maids. Most of them are determined to save the people from suffering, unlike what is said in old novels, "Traveling thousands of miles to become an official is only for money." Therefore, in terms of diet and daily life, they should not seek anything too good. If there is a public servant who refuses to go to work without an eighteen-story or twenty-seven-story building, what kind of political achievements do you think he will have after taking office?

Even if we take a step back and say that the size and beauty of the government office is the respect of the people and not created by the officials, I think the people's servants should also resign at this time and say: How many people in the country have no place to live? I really feel uneasy working in such a big government office. Therefore, until the people have at least a snail's house each, I will definitely work in the open air...

### The Mystery of the Palace of Eternal Life

â€” Wang Baili

The legend of the Palace of Eternal Life, performed on the national day of mourning in the Kangxi year of Dingmao (corresponding to the 26th year of Kangxi), offended many people. This point is consistently recorded in books such as Wu Mei's "Gu Qu Chen Tan," Wang Dongxu's "Liu Nan Bi Ji," and Ruan Wushan's "Cha Yu Ke Hua," leaving no room for doubt. However, the performance on the national day of mourning was merely the headline accusation; the details beneath the surface are where the real story lies. These details vary in different accounts. For the sake of clarity, I will transcribe two different versions below for reference.

"Liu Nan Sui Bi" states: "During the years of Kangxi Dingmao and Wuchen, the actors of the capital's Liyuan troupe considered the Neiju Troupe as the best. At that time, Hong Fangsi, a student of the Qiantang Hongtaixue, had just completed the play 'The Palace of Eternal Life' and taught it to the Neiju Troupe to perform. The Holy Ancestor watched it and praised it, granting the actors twenty taels of silver. He also commended it to the princes. Consequently, all princes and cabinet ministers had the play performed at their banquets. The 'red packets' they received were the same amount as the imperial gift. The actors of the Neiju Troupe gained a considerable amount, and they reported to Hong, saying, 'Thanks to your new work, we have received many rewards. We invite you to a banquet and perform the play to accompany the wine. We will invite all your friends to come as well.' They chose a date and prepared the feast, holding a grand gathering at the Shengyuan Garden, inviting all the famous figures in the capital. However, Zhao Xingzhan (Zhao Zhengjie) of our county (i.e., Changshu) was not invited. Zhao was working at the residence of Censor Wang, and he spoke to Wang, urging him to submit a memorial, saying that the day was the Empress Dowager's death anniversary, and holding a banquet with music was a great disrespect. He requested that they be punished according to the law. The Emperor read the memorial and ordered the Ministry of Justice to imprison them. Nearly fifty scholars and students were removed from their positions. Zhao Zan-shan Shenfu (Zhixin) of Yidu, and Cha Taixue Xia Chong (Silian) of Haining, were among the most prominent. Later, Cha changed his name to Shenxing and passed the imperial examinations, while Zhao remained unemployed for the rest of his life."

"Cha Yu Ke Hua" states: "Zhao Qiugu Zhixin was impeached and dismissed by Censor Huang Dahong for attending a performance of 'The Palace of Eternal Life' at Hong Fangsi's residence during the national mourning period of Dingmao. Xu Shengli, an editor of Jia Yan, was also at the banquet. During the interrogation, he bribed the actors of the Juhe Troupe to falsely claim that he was not present, and was thus spared. The people of the capital had a saying: 'Although the mourning robes have been removed, the mourning period is not yet over. How can one enter the theater? One has three parts of fault, do not blame old Huang for the impeachment. Qiugu's talent is unmatched, a promising young scholar; alas, a single performance of 'The Palace of Eternal Life' ended his career! The Zhou Wang Temple priest is frivolous, also indulging in the "Palace of Eternal Life". Shaking out incense money to seek escape, tailoring costumes in the Juhe Troupe.' Xu Jianyi had a beautiful beard, and was referred to as Zhou Zishi. He later became an academician. It is said that Censor Huang was selected for a position in the capital by the Zhixian, and gave local products and poetry manuscripts to many famous scholars. When it came to Qiugu, he replied with a note saying: 'Local products are gratefully received, the manuscripts are respectfully returned.' Huang hated him to the core, hence the impeachment."

In summary, not only do the surnames of the impeaching censor differ ("Wang" and "Huang") (hereafter temporarily referred to as Huang), but also the location of the performance, one being Shengyuan Garden, the other being Hong Fangsi's residence; the troupe name, one being "Neiju," the other being "Juhe," also differs. Furthermore, the reasons for the impeachment differ significantly. One is Zhao Xingzhan's displeasure at being excluded from the invitation, urging Huang to submit a memorial. The other is Huang Dahong's resentment toward Qiugu for the insult of "respectfully returning the manuscripts." In ordinary circumstances, "Cha Yu Ke Hua" seems more plausible: Huang felt extremely slighted by Qiugu's "respectfully returning the manuscripts," and therefore hated him to the core. This was Huang's personal matter. Zhao Xingzhan's urging would only be a minor annoyance to Huang, not something that would pain him to the core. However, even though Huang hated Qiugu to the core, Qiugu was merely one of the invited guests, not the organizer of the performance. It seems unlikely that Huang would be so ruthless as to implicate all the famous figures present out of hatred for one invited guest. My opinion is that Zhao Xingzhan expressed his resentment to Huang, and Huang happened to use Qiugu's presence at the scene as an opportunity to vent his old grudges. Such coincidences often occur. However, this is just my speculation and should not be taken as definitive. I will leave it for learned scholars to investigate.

### Congratulations to Mr. Shougao Chuiwan on His Seventieth Birthday

â€” Yao Yuanzhu

Yan Zhou admired Xi Fu in his later years, praising his abilities as surpassing Han and Ou. Fang and Yao continued the tradition in succession, their names and virtues equally matched. Wangxi in the middle faced many hardships, encountering literary persecution. He cherished Zhongshan and lectured, but who could keep him from the honors? For twenty years, he followed Master Zhenchuan, reluctantly serving as a low-ranking official before retiring. He read books and drank water in leisure, interacting with his neighbors. His writing could move people's emotions, inspiring deep contemplation. His sentences were smooth and clear, avoiding sensationalism, exploring what others found difficult to express. Mr. Gao excelled in writing at a young age, and Fang and Yao's works stirred the nation. Scholars brought their writings and wine, eager to learn from his wisdom. He often composed elegant poems, spreading his fame to distant corners. He never held an official position, enjoying a carefree life on his ten acres of mulberry fields. Alas, the world is in chaos, the rivers and lakes offer no peace. He has retreated to a corner, abandoning half of his possessions, entrusting his books to a boat in Nantang. Now he lives in a rented house, his mind still filled with the essence of books. Though far from Tongcheng and Kunshan, the waters of Anting are clear and bright. Try climbing Ma'an to commemorate Xiang Ji, find pleasure and peace in the scenery. In this small room, he transcends the world, studying countless books, exploring the depths of knowledge. His words are sincere, his figure thin, but his spirit is complete, his eyes clear. He does not need strange and extravagant things to withstand the cold. The green bamboos contain the wind's strength. I know he still has thousands of poems hidden away, precious treasures. I offer this short composition to express my admiration, daring to present my humble work.

### Heyang Pork and Huishan Spring Water

â€” Tan Zhengbi

Having grown accustomed to hearing "the moon is always better in foreign countries," I can't help but recall two stories. Not only are they strikingly similar, but they also echo each other across different eras.

One story concerns the great Song Dynasty writer Su Dongpo, recorded in Pan Changji's "Song Biao Lei Chao," volume seven. It recounts Dongpo's own experience: "When I was in Qixia, I heard that the pork from Heyang was particularly delicious, so I sent someone to buy it. The messenger got drunk, and the pig escaped at night. He bought another pig to replace it. The guests were all amazed, thinking it was beyond what other places could produce. Later, the truth came out, and the guests were greatly disappointed." "Song Biao Lei Chao" is a compilation that draws from Song Dynasty notebooks, so this account is naturally taken from one of those notebooks. However, the modern scholar Ding Chuanjing's "Song Ren Yi Shi Hui Bian" also cites this passage, sourcing it from "Song Biao Lei Chao," indicating that the original source is now difficult to trace.

The other story concerns Qiu Changru of Macheng in the Ming Dynasty, found in Yuan Hongdao's "Yuan Zhonglang Ji," in the essay "After Reading Zhang Youyu's Poem on Huiquan": "My friend Qiu Changru of Macheng traveled east to Wu and Hui, carrying thirty jugs of Huishan spring water. When the boat reached Dafeng, Changru returned first, ordering his servants to carry it back. The servants, disliking the weight, secretly poured it into the river. Only when they reached Daoguan River did they refill the jugs with river water. Changru, unaware, was extremely proud of it. The next day, he invited all the connoisseurs in the city to taste the water. The connoisseurs arrived as scheduled, sitting together in the studio, looking very pleased. He took out the wine vessel, filled porcelain cups with a small amount, passed them around for discussion, and then drank it. After smelling and examining it for a long time, they slowly savored it, making gurgling sounds in their throats. Then they looked at each other and exclaimed, 'How wonderful! What water! If not for Changru's generosity, how would we have the chance to drink this water in our lives?' They all sighed with admiration and left. Half a month later, the servants quarreled, revealing each other's secrets. Changru was furious and dismissed his servants. The connoisseurs who had drunk the water heard of this, and could only sigh in shame." Zhonglang's prose is known for its humor. This passage is particularly representative, vividly depicting the serious demeanor of the connoisseurs while drinking the water, with tremendous force. When the truth is revealed, Changru is furious, and the guests are ashamed. Readers can't help but laugh.

In fact, readers need not laugh. There are many similar things in the world, too many to count. "The moon is always better in foreign countries" has long become a popular saying. Even currency is better in foreign countries, and banks are better in foreign countries. That's why the price of American dollars keeps rising, and Chinese deposits in foreign banks only increase, never being repatriated. Take our own bank as an example: If the same words come from the mouth or pen of someone hailed as an authority, aren't they considered golden rules, and no one can criticize or oppose them?

However, Heyang pork and Huishan spring water, in the mouths of those without discernment, may indeed be indistinguishable from the real thing. But in reality, they have some differences from the ordinary. As for modern people's belief that everything foreign is good, and everything said by authorities is right, this so-called "good" and "right" deserves further study. What is the truth? We'll have to wait for the next installment. We can't draw conclusions just yet.

Many years ago, I included Yuan Hongdao's article in a "Chinese Reader" for middle school students. There was a sentence that read, "This matter is similar to the Heyang pork incident of Dongpo." At the time, I couldn't find the reference to "Heyang pork," so this was the only allusion in the entire book that wasn't annotated. Later, a careful reader specifically wrote to me to ask about it. I honestly told him and promised to inform him as soon as I found out. Who knew that by the time I found out, I had lost his contact information, leaving me unable to tell him. I was very disappointed! Now I am adding this note here, treating it as an open letter to the readers of my "Chinese Reader," and also writing down some of the thoughts I've had.

### Treasure Hunting

â€” Bronze Camel

In the United States, there are groups dedicated to unearthing ancient treasures. Anyone can do it, as long as they have two sets of gardening tools, endless optimismâ€”and a place to dig. The U.S. Antiquities Department already has records of hundreds of potential treasure locations, including pirate caches, sunken treasure ships, and hidden valuables. The pursuit of ready-made wealth is said to be "a truly flourishing American industry." Searching for just one unsubstantiated Arizona mine draws no fewer than seven thousand treasure hunters from around the world.

In 1911, the mail ship Merida sank off the coast of Charles Cape, carrying gold bars, silver bricks, and the jewels from the crown of the deposed Mexican Emperor Maximilian. Rockefeller and Beattle obtained the excavation rights and set about searching for the sunken ship. They found nothing, instead, they spent $500,000. But this kind of record did not discourage treasure hunters. The only reason is that there is a rich "history of success" to encourage them.

A writer and photographer from Boston named Snow has been searching for hidden treasures for twenty years, but without success. Before the war, he heard a story from a sailor named John: A hundred years ago, a mysterious figure came to Boston and found a job as a butler. According to rumors on the docks, the mysterious butler had been a pirate. The man later died in 1882 without revealing his secret. Twenty years later, someone claiming to be the pirate's brother told Sailor John that the pirate had a map buried on Great Brewster Island, according to which a box of treasure could be found.

Now, forty-five years later, Snow heard the story and went to Brewster Island to search. Although the map was not found, he did find a cipher in a wrecked ship, which revealed that the pirate's loot was on Strong Island, outside "Pants Pocket Corner."

Snow rushed there, bringing the necessary equipment, such as shovels and testers sensitive to metal objects. On the sixth dig, they heard the shovel hit a metal box. They dug up two tarnished bronze boxes, and opened them to find a box full of gold coins!

What kept gold diggers hopeful was seeing the family of Board in Florida and made their conviction firmer. It is said that Board's banking business, metal industry, and real estate all started with the discovery of a basket of gold. The pair of boxes was buried by a pirate, La Tuotuo, at the mouth of the Suwannee River. At that time, Board's grandfather ran a sawmill, and a friend gave his grandfather a treasure map. Board followed the map and succeeded in one fell swoop, laying the foundation for their family and business.

Everyone thought the US government owned half of the treasure uncovered, but that's not true. It is said that the government's tax can't exceed 25 percent, and some are as low as 10 percent. But the government has the right to purchase the gold found with cash.

Chapter Nine: Leaking Secrets (56)

Mrs. Zhang said, "If you don't want to ask, then don't ask. Don't be angry." After saying that, she showed a loving and tolerant expression, smiling gently at Zhuzhai, and then got up and left. Yunqing cried for a while, and the anger and frustration in her heart had dissipated, so she was not as impulsive as before. Then, she picked up Qihuan's photo again and looked at it again. She thought to herself that it would be better to return the photo to him. Keeping it would make it seem like she was investigating his whereabouts, which would only make him wary. Moreover, she couldn't bring down Zhusu with just a few photos. If his heart has changed, it would be even worse to reveal it. I absolutely cannot let that happen. It would be my lifelong regret. Zhuzhai is now obsessed with Qihuan. These singing girls are fickle by nature. Even if Zhuzhai can marry her, it would be a lifelong burden. I must also point him in the right direction so that he can escape from the sea of â€‹â€‹misery. Yunqing is the most careful and considerate. After thinking about it repeatedly, she calmed down and put Zhuzhai's photo back in his coat pocket. She tiptoed to Zhuzhai's bed to take a look. She saw Zhuzhai leaning his head against the pillow, sleeping soundly. His cheeks were flushed with wine, making him even more handsome. She thought that it was a pity that this person's heart had changed and he was no longer mine! Thinking of this, she didn't want to look at him anymore and returned to her room. She lay on the bed, thinking over and over again, but she couldn't fall asleep. She felt that her hopes were empty. Seeing Zhuzhai and Qihuan getting together, she was really unwilling. Zhuzhai used her to persuade Fengsheng to get a divorce. Now, what can I do to make Qihuan not want to marry Zhuzhai? I have no friendship with Qihuan, so it would be presumptuous to go to her house. Not only would Qihuan not believe me, but if Zhuzhai found out, he would be even more disgusted. This is definitely not an option. As for persuading Zhuzhai, he is obsessed with Qihuan and has no ability to judge right from wrong. It would be useless to talk to him. At this time, the only solution is to tell Fengsheng and let her, in the name of Zhuzhai's legitimate wife, negotiate with Qihuan. They are actresses, so they have the greatest vanity. If they see the wife come to their door to tell them, they will never want to be a mistress. In this way, perhaps their union can be broken up. That night, Yunqing thought about this over and over again and couldn't sleep. Until eight o'clock the next morning, Zhuzhai woke up, had some refreshments, and came in to tell Yunqing that he was going to work. Yunqing was hesitant to say anything. When she saw him, she couldn't say a word. Mrs. Zhang was a straightforward person. Seeing that Zhuzhai was about to leave, she called him into the house and asked him if he planned to get married in the future. She also expressed her willingness to marry Yunqing to him. Zhuzhai was very embarrassed when Mrs. Zhang suddenly raised this question. He couldn't answer for a while and could only stammer, "I haven't considered this matter yet, and there are still problems in the family. It's impossible to talk about this right now."

### Refusal to Redeem Sold Rice Paddy, Dispute Over Rent Paid in Rice

[Mr. Wang Sihan asks] A, Mr. A, sold several acres of rice paddy to B twenty years ago, with a contract as proof. However, the sold field is still cultivated by A nearby, and he only pays B interest every year. The sales contract states, "The field can be redeemed at the original price within five years." The redemption period has expired, and A has died. Since the Anti-Japanese War, he has not paid interest. The sales contract also states, "If interest is not paid in any year, the owner shall take charge of the property in accordance with the contract and hire another tenant." According to Article 380 of the Civil Code, the seller may not buy back after the five-year period has expired. Is it applicable to this case? B, can A's son sue the court to order B to return the field sold by his father, which he has occupied and refused to return? C, does A's son have any legal basis for redeeming the sold field now? D, is B legally justified in sending a letter stating that he is withdrawing the original agreement to redeem the field, based on Article 380 of the Civil Code?

The rent is paid in rice, and the tenant has formally signed the lease. However, the council has recently resolved that rent cannot be paid in rice, so the tenant refuses to pay in rice. What should be done?

[Legal Answer by Mr. Tang Mingshi] A. Article 380 of the Civil Code does not say that it cannot be bought back; it is not applicable here. If it is a pledge right, the term is 30 years (Civil Code Article 912), and if the agreed term is less than 15 years, it cannot be attached with a clause that it is an absolute sale if not redeemed upon expiration (Civil Code Article 913). Furthermore, according to Article 923, paragraph 2, of the Civil Code, if the pledger does not redeem the pledged object at the original pledge price after two years from the expiration of the pledge period, the pledgee shall obtain ownership of the pledged object. (B) Since the land is said to have been absolutely sold, but the sales contract also states the time limit for redemption at the original price, the ownership and pledge rights are confused. If the sales contract is valid, it is a problem of eviction; if it is a pledge right, it is a problem of redemption. It all depends on the evidence. (C) Determine the basis by calculating the time in accordance with the above articles. (D) The notice is of course valid.

According to the principle of freedom of contract, once a contract is signed, it must be performed in accordance with the contract. There is no explicit prohibition of rent paid in rice in current law.
