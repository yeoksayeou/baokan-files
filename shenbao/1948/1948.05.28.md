### Weng Wenhao Flies from Nanjing to Shanghai to Confer with He Yingqin and Gu Mengyu. The List of Heads of Ministries and Commissions May Be Released Soon.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] The list of heads for the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan has not yet been announced as of the 27th. One of the reasons is whether or not the Min and Qing parties will participate. At 9:00 AM on the 27th, Weng Wenhao met with Lei Zhen, who is assisting him in consulting with the two parties, to exchange views on the progress of communication. He also spoke with Zhang Lisheng, Gu Zhenggang, and Shen Yi. At 10:00 AM, Mr. Weng paid his respects to the President to make a request. He did not leave until after 12:00 PM. After returning to his residence, he met with Li Weiguo. Around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, Mr. Weng boarded a China Airlines flight to Shanghai. This trip was planned in the morning and decided after consulting with the President.

[Our Report] Executive Yuan President Weng Wenhao arrived in Shanghai at 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon on a China Airlines flight from the capital, accompanied by Nanjing Mayor Shen Yi. Mr. Weng kept this trip strictly confidential beforehand, so very few people in the city knew about it. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Weng first drove to Linsen Middle Road to visit General He Yingqin, who was recuperating in Shanghai, but he was out. Mayor Wu heard the news and visited, talking for about ten minutes before leaving. In the evening, Mr. He learned of this and went to Mr. Weng's residence on Xiaoshadu Road to return the visit, discussing matters for half an hour. Although Mr. He is on vacation in Shanghai, he is in constant telephone contact with senior officials in the capital. Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong even called to inquire about him the other day. Those around Mr. He frankly stated that Mr. He will assume an important position in the country. Therefore, it can be asserted that President Weng's visit to Mr. He yesterday has great significance in the cabinet formation process. Around 10:00 PM in the evening, Mr. Weng once again traveled simply and inconspicuously to Hunan Road to visit Mr. Gu Mengyu, who is rumored to be the upcoming Vice President of the Executive Yuan, and held secret talks for more than two hours, finally taking his leave at 12:20 AM. When Mr. Weng met with our newspaper's reporter, he was very secretive about the content of the conversation. However, both Mr. Weng and Mr. Gu are famous scholars from the north and have a deep friendship. Moreover, Mayor Shen Yi, who came to Shanghai with Mr. Weng, and Mr. Gu were classmates in Germany. Their participation in the consultation is noteworthy. Mr. Gu returned to China from the United States not long ago, and there are high calls for him to serve as the Vice President of the Executive Yuan. When the reporter asked President Weng in person whether Mr. Gu plans to go to the capital soon, he replied that he would know later. Furthermore, after President Weng arrived in Shanghai yesterday, it was generally speculated that he would personally break the legislative deadlock between the Min and Qing parties. It is now learned that because important official matters in the capital urgently need to be dealt with, he is scheduled to return to the capital today. Zhu Neng will visit the leaders of the two parties. It is reported that both the Min and Qing parties held central standing committee meetings yesterday to discuss the issue of participating in the new cabinet. Because no conclusion was reached, the meeting will continue today. Neither party was aware of President Weng's quiet arrival in Shanghai yesterday. The Social Democratic Party even telegraphed President Weng about the meeting situation at 10:00 PM last night, explaining that Xu Chuanlin will postpone his return to the capital.

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] General He Yingqin returned the visit to President Weng at 9:40 PM last night. When taking his leave, President Weng escorted him to the door. The two talked as they walked, appearing very happy. Many believe that President Weng invited Mr. He to serve as the Minister of National Defense in the new Executive Yuan, and a decision has probably been made. It is also learned that Mr. He is scheduled to return to the capital by plane this morning (28th).

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] Zhang Lisheng firmly refuses to assume the positions of Vice President of the New Executive Yuan and Minister of Interior. It is rumored that the Kuomintang Central Committee has decided to appoint Mr. Zhang as the Minister of Organization, because Chen Lifu has been reassigned as the Vice President of the Legislative Yuan and will be going to the United States, having already resigned from his position as Minister of Organization. One of Peng Xuepei and Hong Lanyou will be selected to fill the Interior Minister position vacated by Mr. Zhang. It has not yet been decided whether Gu Zhenggang will continue as the Minister of Social Affairs. Mr. Gu has expressed his firm refusal to continue. Weng Wenhao has sincerely persuaded him to stay in person on the 27th. It is rumored that if Mr. Gu insists on resigning, Hong Lanyou and He Zhonghan are both hopefuls to succeed him.

### The Question of Min and Qing Party Legislators: The Government Will Seek a Swift Solution, and Participation in the Executive Yuan May Be Discussed First

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] According to reliable sources, although the Min and Qing parties regard resolving the legislative dispute as a prerequisite for participating in the Executive Yuan, after two days of consultations, it is possible to discuss the Executive Yuan issue first, and the government will find a way to quickly resolve the legislative dispute. After the leaders of the Min and Qing parties convene in Shanghai, they will return to the capital on the 28th to further negotiate with the government so that the new Executive Yuan can be formed quickly. The principle of the Youth Party having two ministers and two political committee members, and the Social Democratic Party having one minister and one political committee member has been determined. The candidates will be recommended by the Min and Qing parties themselves after obtaining their consent.

[Our Report] The Min and Qing parties convened central standing committee meetings yesterday. Key personnel in the capital rushed back to participate, discussing the legislative deadlock and participation in the new cabinet. After the meeting, the Social Democratic Party's attitude remained that participation in the new cabinet should be premised on resolving the issue of legislative seats. Executive Yuan President Weng Wenhao invited Zhang Junmai to the capital for face-to-face discussions via long-distance telephone yesterday, but he did not accept. After the Youth Party's central standing committee meeting yesterday, its spokesperson also stated: "Participation in the new cabinet should be premised on resolving the legislative seat deadlock. What the party is fighting for is the principle of 'three-party consultation.' Under this approach, Lei Zhen's proposal can be used as a basis for discussion. The Youth Party does not completely insist on the number of seats. After the legislative issue is resolved, the Youth Party will put forward concrete opinions on participating in the constitutional government." It also stated that the Min and Qing parties are in constant contact to discuss the legislative issue. It is also learned that Wu Tiecheng came to Shanghai yesterday to make every effort to break the deadlock between the Min and Qing parties.

### Legislative Special Review Committee Suggests Adding Two Committees

To be submitted to the Yuan meeting for discussion today

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] The Legislative Yuan's Special Review Committee continued its meeting on the 27th, both in the morning and afternoon, chaired by Cheng Tianfang. After heated discussion, the committee resolved six points regarding the types and number of committees to be established by the Yuan: (1) Add a Maritime Affairs Committee, the scope of which is to be determined by the general meeting. (2) Add a Food and Grain Policy Committee. (3) Merge the Civil Law, Criminal Law, and Commercial Law committees into a Civil, Criminal, and Commercial Law Committee. This resolution was a majority opinion, so whether or not it will be established depends on the Yuan's decision. (4) The Internal Affairs and Local Autonomy Committee and the Economic and Resources Committee do not need to be separated into four committees and will remain as originally stipulated in the Organizational Law. (5) It is recommended that the Yuan invoke the first half of Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Organizational Law to establish a Procedure Committee, composed of one representative elected from each standing and special committee, to convene when necessary. (6) It is recommended that the Yuan consider establishing a US Aid Special Committee and a Special Committee to Investigate the Capital of Powerful Families. Thus, the work of the Special Review Committee has been completed. The revised organizational law provisions and various suggestions not submitted by the Yuan for discussion will be submitted together to the fifth Yuan meeting on the 28th.

[Our Report] Bei Zuyi is scheduled to fly from Hong Kong to Shanghai today and leave Shanghai for the United States on June 2 to continue his mission as a technical representative. Because his stay in the United States will be relatively long, he will be accompanied by his family. Mr. Bei's main task in the United States is to provide China with the required quantity and degree of need for various US aid materials so that they can be shipped to China separately according to their priority. This task is to be coordinated with the mission of Lapham in China. As for the negotiation of new loans, it is only a supplementary task because there is still no clue so far. In addition, Mr. Bei will also serve as the supervisor of the Bank of China in the Americas during his stay in the United States, but the nature of this task is not important.

[Central News Agency, New York, 26th] New York Governor Dewey stated today that he will continue to denounce the Democratic government's China policy in his presidential nomination campaign.

### The Bandit Forces in Changchun are Defeated, The Battle Situation on the Outskirts is Quiet

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 27th] Military sources: The battle situation in Changchun has been relatively quiet in the past 24 hours. The bandit forces have been defeated. The outposts of Changbian, Xiaohelong, Fanjiatun, and Shihugou have all been captured by the bandits. The bandits continue to gather in the Jiutai, Kalun, and Yitong areas east of Changchun, and there seems to be a new deployment. The bandit Third Column stationed in Xi'an has crossed Siping and fled west to Tongjiangkou, seemingly heading towards western Liaoning. According to a spokesman for the Suppression Headquarters, the bandits' purpose in attacking Changchun is: (1) to counter the National Army's suppression, (2) to cover the retreat of their main force to the south. Therefore, the bandits attacking Chang are all independent divisions, and the battle of Changchun is not a main force engagement.

[Another Dispatch] The Fifth Column of the bandits was found in the area between Liaoyang and Benxi. In the past, the communists avoided using this kind of designation.

Editorial

### Demand for a New Foreign Exchange Policy

The necessity for improving foreign exchange policy has become a consensus among Chinese and foreigners, both in and out of the government. Since the recent announcement of the new measures for settling foreign exchange, this call for thorough improvement has only intensified. When Minister of Finance Yu assumed the concurrent position of Governor of the Central Bank, he also publicly stated: "Future foreign exchange policies will be improved at any time based on factual needs." This shows that this is no longer the view of only a few people in society. We would like to simply reiterate the reality of the factual needs as follows:

(1) Stifling exports. The reason is that the exchange rate is too low to cover production and sales costs, while overseas selling prices cannot be lowered, thus weakening its competitive power.

(2) Impeding imports. This is the result of excessive restrictions, insufficient quotas, and uncertain settlement dates.

(3) Creating a black market. This is also the result of the unreasonableness of the above two measures. Because the export exchange rate is too low, many exporters are forced to underreport and undervalue exports, leaving a portion of foreign exchange to be sold on the black market, or even engaging in large-scale smuggling without customs clearance, resulting in the total loss of export foreign exchange and exacerbating the rampant smuggling. As for the import sector, not to mention those who smuggle goods into the country, even legally permitted imports result in too much profit due to the subsidy-like benefits obtained from the exchange rate, leading to many crimes, troubles, and a black market.

(4) Driving away overseas remittances. Since the exchange rate is low and overseas Chinese merchants are not allowed to use their own foreign exchange to purchase goods for import, they are unwilling to accept losses and have no choice but to escape to Hong Kong by various means, creating prosperity there.

(5) Stimulating prices. This does not seem to be in line with the authorities' expected goals. However, intermittent increases in the exchange rate have too great an impact, and each adjustment inevitably triggers a wave of price increases. Moreover, each adjustment always seems to be on the path to higher prices. Therefore, the general public has developed a habit of expecting prices to rise, which has increased the sentiment of speculative hoarding. Even before each adjustment, the expectations and rumors in the market are a strong factor stimulating prices.

(6) Hindering the progress of agriculture, industry, commerce, and transportation. Because international trade cannot be carried out flexibly, import and export businesses have to wait and see and come to a standstill. Furthermore, with the supply of imported raw materials failing to keep up, many industries have had to suspend production or reduce output, and recently many are trying to relocate to Hong Kong to solve their raw material, machinery, and export problems. As for large-volume exports, at present, they are still mostly agricultural products. With prices too low and exports stagnating, the adverse impact will naturally spread to rural areas. The most regrettable thing is that, due to the stagnation of domestic and foreign sales channels, the shipping industry, which regularly transports goods, has also fallen into a very difficult situation due to sluggish business and insufficient revenue to cover expenses.

In addition, the lack of development in legitimate businesses has further deepened two undesirable situations: one is reduced production and insufficient supply; the other is an abundance of idle capital with no place to go, which has intensified the price涨风, spread the black market, and made it impossible to control. In order to cure the symptoms, the authorities have imposed various controls on finance, prices, and production, as if building dams to prevent flooding, as a certain financial authority said. Unfortunately, the foreign exchange policy is too unreasonable, and the fundamental shortcomings cannot be remedied. This kind of dam-building and flood prevention will ultimately be unable to withstand the torrents of flooding!

For this reason, we believe that the most important economic measure for the Executive Yuan after the implementation of the constitution should be to change the foreign exchange policy. Currently, there are differing opinions on whether the foreign exchange policy should be completely opened up. However, we believe that the following three paths should be adopted immediately: one is the implementation of import linkage system; two is the opening of 自仅 foreign exchange; and three is the transportation of US aid materials.

The proper use of US aid was given great emphasis in the administrative report submitted by the government and in the first press conference held by the newly appointed President Weng. There should be no problem with "the proper use of this assistance and the future urging of relevant personnel to make earnest efforts." As for the first two points, although various parties have repeatedly urged them, and the relevant authorities have even drafted plans and recommended implementation, they have ultimately been shelved due to too many considerations. The two deepest concerns are: one is creating arbitrage and a black market, and the other is stimulating prices and triggering inflation. We will not discuss the accuracy of these two reasons at this time, but we want to ask: Under the current foreign exchange policy, is there no black market? Will prices not be stimulated? If the above-mentioned points (3), (4), and (5) are indeed facts and cannot be denied, then the reason for the repeated delays must be attributed to the excessive laziness and irresponsibility of the responsible personnel. It is hoped that this kind of bureaucratic style will not be seen again in the new Executive Yuan!

### Northeast Industry and Mining Struggle to Support; Power Generation Sets New Record; Coal and Cement Production Both Increase

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 27th] Currently, Northeast industry and mining are still struggling to cooperate with military operations in a difficult environment.

### Sheng Xuanhuai, the "Opium King" Traitor Case, Re-Tried and Still Sentenced to Death

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Sheng Xuanhuai, the "Opium King" traitor, was sentenced to death again by the Capital High Court on the 27th. Sheng's traitor case was previously sentenced to death by the Court, but the Supreme Court overturned the verdict and ordered a re-trial, and the result was still a death sentence. At 11:10 this morning, Sheng was escorted from the Laohuqiao Detention Center to the High Court. His hair was all white, he looked old and frail, his body was short, and he wore a dark gray padded robe. At 11:50, Judge Jin Shiding of the First Criminal Division, along with Judges Shen Tuochen and Zhong Zhengxian, and Clerk Sha Rongsheng, took the stand. The bailiff helped Sheng stand at the defendant's seat. First, they asked his name, age, and origin. He stated that he was 74 years old, from Wujin, Jiangsu. Then, Judge Jin announced the main text of the verdict: "Sheng Xuanhuai colluded with enemy countries, plotted to resist this country, sentenced to death, deprived of civil rights for life, and all property confiscated except for the necessary living expenses for his family." Then, he explained the main points of the verdict, stating that Sheng had held important positions in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic, and possessed a large fortune, but still did not know how to love his country and himself. During the enemy-puppet period, he first formed the Hongji Charity Hall to act as a front for the enemy, openly selling opium and promoting the drug policy. Then he formed the Yuhua Espionage Company, providing the enemy with military salt. His claims of transporting military supplies for the Forward Army and negotiating with the enemy in Shanghai for the return of confiscated legal tender were all unsubstantiated and could not be adopted as reasons for reducing his sentence. Based on his crimes, he should be sentenced to the extreme penalty. Finally, Sheng was advised that if he still disagreed with the verdict, he could apply for a retrial within ten days after the verdict was served. At 12:00, the court adjourned and Sheng was returned to custody.

As a result, Dai Mingyou and another bandit, Zhu Deming, were arrested and interrogated around 9:00 PM the day before yesterday. After the arrest, they initially argued that they were legitimate merchants.

正陽第五次解圍
Zhengyang Relieved for the Fifth Time.

  本報記者　卜眠
Our Correspondent Bu Mian

  正陽爲平漢路之屏障，信陽之外衣，淮河北岸之走廊。他的安危，影響於平漢路的交通，也影響於信陽的安全，堅守正陽的國軍（事實上係地方部隊改編的保安團），他們深深感到自身責任的重大，而不敢輕易使人失望，這次戰役，始終抱着必死的決心，捍衛城垣，因此軍事當局對正陽的前途是樂觀的。
Zhengyang is the shield of the Pinghan Railway, the outer garment of Xinyang, and the corridor on the north bank of the Huai River. Its safety affects the transportation of the Pinghan Railway and the security of Xinyang. The National Army (actually a security regiment reorganized from local troops) who steadfastly guarded Zhengyang deeply felt the importance of their responsibility and dared not easily disappoint others. In this battle, they always held a determination to die defending the city walls, so the military authorities are optimistic about the future of Zhengyang.

　如果說，已經淪陷或凡是匪軍竄擾過的地方，是被迫失去貞潔的少女，那麼正陽是一位聖潔的處女。在豫南，祗有正陽與信陽，一直在國軍的掌握中，從未丟過一次。匪軍曾經圍攻正陽先後四次，終未得逞，這一次，我軍依然以寡敵衆，擊敗匪軍，全城安然無恙。
If the places that have been captured or disturbed by bandit troops are like young women who have been forced to lose their chastity, then Zhengyang is a pure virgin. In southern Henan, only Zhengyang and Xinyang have always been under the control of the National Army, never lost even once. The bandit troops had besieged Zhengyang four times before, but never succeeded. This time, our army still defeated the bandit troops with fewer troops, and the whole city was safe and sound.

　　此次匪軍圍城兵力，有魏鳳樓，金少山獨立旅，沙南專署沙南支隊和汝河支隊，劉伯承的第一縱隊，二·六縱隊各一部，共四萬人。一日魏鳳樓從黃汎區竄入汝南（因該地無國軍），二日向東南推進，三日竄抵正陽東北卅里之傅砦汝店，當天黃昏，記者走訪朱副司令官，問他對正陽當面匪情作何觀感？他泰然的回答我：「沒有關係，這是家常便飯，正陽絕不會失守，你等候好消息吧！」短短的幾句話，好似「定心丸」，走出司令部，我暗自的爲正陽守軍祈禱，祝福他們像以往一樣的傳來捷報。這天夜裏三點鐘，匪一部約五六百人，向城郊佯攻，企岡誘我主力出城，一鼓消滅，乘虛攻城，守軍早窺破其鬼計，遂未受愚。拂曉，匪又撤到離城三華里的地方，這是正陽的序幕戰，從這一天起，戰事便一天一天的緊張了。
The bandit troops besieging the city this time included Wei Fenglou, Jin Shaoshan's Independent Brigade, the Shanan Detachment of the Shanan Commissioner's Office, the Ru River Detachment, Liu Bocheng's First Column, and parts of the Second and Sixth Columns, totaling 40,000 people. One day, Wei Fenglou sneaked into Runan from the Yellow River Flood Area (because there were no National Army troops in that area). The next day, they advanced southeast. On the third day, they sneaked to Fuzhai Rudian, 30 li northeast of Zhengyang. That evening, the reporter visited Deputy Commander Zhu and asked him for his views on the bandit situation facing Zhengyang. He calmly replied, "It doesn't matter, this is commonplace. Zhengyang will never fall, just wait for good news!" These few words were like a "peace of mind pill." Walking out of the headquarters, I secretly prayed for the defenders of Zhengyang, wishing them to send good news as before. At three o'clock that night, a group of bandits, about five or six hundred people, launched a feigned attack on the outskirts of the city, attempting to lure our main force out of the city to wipe them out in one fell swoop and then take advantage of the opportunity to attack the city. The defenders had already seen through their trick and were not fooled. At dawn, the bandits retreated to a place three li away from the city. This was the opening battle of Zhengyang. From that day on, the war became tense day by day.

　　四日下午，匪軍抓了幾百民伕，帶着數百攻城之雲梯，魏鳳樓和金少山親自督戰，由東北分三路向城郊進攻，至晚十時，四面包圍，電話綫割斷。這時，正陽至信陽有綫電話已不通，命令的傅達與指揮，全依賴無綫電話和報話機了。晚上，我又去看朱副司令官，他的談話神情仍極其自然，與昨天毫無異樣，我很敬佩這位指揮官沉着應戰的精神，夜晚我寸步不離的徘徊在作戰科傅科長的辦公室，等侯正陽的戰報，大衆抽朋，談天，……來點綴這緊張空氣中的沉寂，至午夜，才去就寢。
On the afternoon of the fourth, the bandit troops captured hundreds of civilians and brought hundreds of siege ladders. Wei Fenglou and Jin Shaoshan personally supervised the battle, launching an attack on the outskirts of the city from three routes in the northeast. By 10 p.m., they had surrounded the city on all sides, and the telephone lines were cut. At this time, the wired telephone line from Zhengyang to Xinyang was no longer working. The delivery of orders and command relied entirely on wireless telephones and radio transceivers. In the evening, I went to see Deputy Commander Zhu again. His expression and conversation were still very natural, with no difference from yesterday. I greatly admired the commander's calm and responsive spirit. At night, I lingered closely in the office of Section Chief Fu of the Operations Section, waiting for the war report from Zhengyang. Everyone smoked, chatted, ... to embellish the silence in this tense atmosphere, and only went to bed at midnight.

　　五日上午一時（即四日夜），劉伯承的第一縱隊也加了攻入城的行列（按一縱隊係三日晚由新祭西汝河東竄來，四日渡汝河，五日始抵正陽）匪軍聲勢浩大，亡命之徒的匪軍，又迷信龐大數字的武力了，向四門猛攻，以南門爲主攻對象，曾反覆衝殺三次，我守軍阮專員身先士卒，督師西門，夏縣長發動民衆運輸彈藥，送飯送茶魏副團長（按該團張團長赴京參加國民大會）沉着指揮，軍民士氣旺盛，遂將來犯之匪一一殲滅於城郊之外壕內。激戰至拂曉，槍砲聲漸趨緩和，匪軍惟恐空軍轟炸，而暫停攻擊。入晚，匪軍又發動攻擊，要番猛撲四門，我砲兵發揮其最大之威力，制壓敵陣，摧毀匪之攻擊隊形，南關北關，火光冲天，匪軍行動，黑白分明可諾，雙方徹夜鏖戰，此爲圍城緊張之一幕。
At 1 a.m. on the 5th (i.e., the night of the 4th), Liu Bocheng's First Column also joined the ranks of attacking the city (according to records, the First Column sneaked east from Xinjixixi Ru River on the evening of the 3rd, crossed the Ru River on the 4th, and only arrived in Zhengyang on the 5th). The bandit troops had a huge momentum. The desperate bandit troops were once again superstitious about the power of large numbers, and launched a fierce attack on the four gates, with the south gate as the main target, repeatedly charging and killing three times. Our defending troops, led by Commissioner Ruan, supervised the battle at the west gate. County Magistrate Xia mobilized the masses to transport ammunition, deliver food and tea. Deputy Regiment Commander Wei (Regiment Commander Zhang went to Beijing to participate in the National Assembly) calmly commanded, and the morale of the army and the people was high. They annihilated the invading bandits one by one in the outer trenches on the outskirts of the city. The fierce battle lasted until dawn, and the sound of gunfire gradually subsided. The bandit troops, fearing aerial bombardment, temporarily suspended their attack. In the evening, the bandit troops launched another attack, with key bandits fiercely attacking the four gates. Our artillery exerted its maximum power, suppressing the enemy's positions and destroying the bandit's attack formations. At the south and north gates, the fire was blazing. The actions of the bandit troops were clear as black and white. The two sides fought fiercely all night long. This was one of the tense scenes of the siege.

　　六日拂曉，匪軍攻勢頓挫，下午四時，我空軍機羣凌空猛炸，並向詎陣掃射，匪軍大爲恐懼。夜晚，匪又前仆後湧，不惜犧牲，使用「人海戰術」，向南門連續攻擊七次，每次最多支持半小時，因傷亡過重，七氣　喪，逐發生動搖。至午夜二時，大雨傾盆而下，匪軍乃把握此良好時機，藉雨聲之掩護，向四門作瘋狂之攻擊，先後連七次之多，我砲兵以純熟之射擊技能，向匪全面掃射，彈不虛發，匪傷亡慘重，一時雷電交加，風雨淅瀝，匪軍最高級指揮官（某旅長）乃作孤注一擲，集合官長三十人，士兵八九百人，　少校參謀李國珍及隨員，至北關外八百公尺土廟前，組織突擊攻城隊，並將山砲兩門隨伴掩護攻擊，此爲戰鬥之最高潮，不料爲我砲兵觀測所發見，且由諜報人員證實此一行動，魏副團長（砲兵出身）當即指揮砲兵向該處猛轟，砲彈甫射出兩發，觀測所以迅速之觀測，報吿全部命中，匪之指揮官及全體官兵皆葬送該地，軍心動搖，遂紛亂向後撤退，我守軍立刻派出一營由北門，一連由南門出擊，集中砲火，向無政府狀態之匪軍作疲勞射擊，至是，匪軍乃失去信心，準備退却。
At dawn on the 6th, the bandit troops' offensive was frustrated. At 4 p.m., our air force group fiercely bombed from the air and strafed the bandit positions, causing great fear among the bandit troops. At night, the bandits surged forward again and again, sparing no sacrifices, using "human wave tactics" to continuously attack the south gate seven times. Each time, they could only sustain for half an hour at most. Because of heavy casualties, their morale was lost, and they began to waver. At 2 a.m. at midnight, heavy rain poured down. The bandit troops seized this good opportunity and, using the cover of the rain, launched a frenzied attack on the four gates, one after another seven times. Our artillery, with its skillful shooting skills, fully strafed the bandits, with every shot hitting its target. The bandits suffered heavy casualties. For a time, there was thunder and lightning, and the wind and rain were pouring. The highest-ranking commander of the bandit troops (a certain brigade commander) made a desperate gamble, gathering 30 officers and 800-900 soldiers, including Major Staff Officer Li Guozhen and his entourage, in front of the earth temple 800 meters outside the north gate to organize a storming force. Two mountain guns were also brought along to cover the attack. This was the climax of the battle. Unexpectedly, it was discovered by our artillery observation post, and intelligence personnel confirmed this action. Deputy Regiment Commander Wei (who came from the artillery) immediately directed the artillery to bombard that place. As soon as two shells were fired, the observation post, with rapid observation, reported that all of them had hit the target. The bandit commander and all the officers and soldiers were buried there. The morale of the army wavered, and they retreated in confusion. Our defending troops immediately sent a battalion out of the north gate and a company out of the south gate to attack. They concentrated artillery fire and launched harassing fire on the bandit troops in a state of anarchy. At this point, the bandit troops lost confidence and prepared to retreat.

　　七日下午三時，援軍魯師已飛抵達正陽北四十里之唐家舖，城內守軍更爲興奮，同時城外老百姓亦揮淚燃火，燒掉自己的房子，使匪軍無怯利用家屋前進，而我軍射界之障礙亦無形掃淸，這一種犧牲小我完成大我精神，令人可歌可泣。黃昏，匪軍以援軍尙未入城，此乃千鈞一髮之一剎那，成敗在此一舉，於是，作最後一次的猛烈攻擊，以兩團攻南關，北關一個團，其餘作層層遞補之隊形，分向西南·東南·南·西南與南之間四點，反覆猛撲，並强迫老百姓機遝門板，木板，木梯，浮梯，至外壕內，致無辜民衆亦遭受不幸之犧牲，待匪走入外　之木板上時，我軍將手榴彈像雨點似的扔下去，壕內匪屍堆集如山，　水猶如血海。至夜十二時，匪雖犧牲慘烈，仍像賭徒似的下注，作困獸似的攻擊，我守軍以旺盛之氣燄，官兵上下ｇ　致，發揮最大之戰鬥精神，匪終無法越雷池．八日晨，援軍進城，匪軍大爲失色，失望之餘，狼狽逃竄。九點正，匪軍向東·東南·東北分三路撤退，正陽遂吿解圍。此役匪傷亡官兵兩千餘人，逃亡六千多人，失蹤兩千人，斃旅長一，團長一，參謀長蕭乃，我僅傷亡六十餘人。
At 3 p.m. on the 7th, the Lu Division reinforcements had flown to Tangjiapu, 40 li north of Zhengyang. The defending troops in the city were even more excited. At the same time, the common people outside the city also shed tears and set fire to their houses, so that the bandit troops would not dare to use the houses to advance, and the obstacles to our army's line of fire were also invisibly cleared. This spirit of sacrificing the small self to achieve the greater self is admirable and moving. At dusk, the bandit troops, seeing that the reinforcements had not yet entered the city, knew that this was a critical moment, with success or failure hinging on this one move. Therefore, they launched a final fierce attack, with two regiments attacking the south gate and one regiment attacking the north gate. The rest formed a layered formation and repeatedly pounced on four points: southwest, southeast, south, and between southwest and south. They forced the common people to carry door panels, wooden planks, wooden ladders, and floating ladders to the outer trenches, causing innocent civilians to suffer unfortunate sacrifices. When the bandits walked onto the wooden planks on the outside, our army threw grenades down like raindrops. The bandit corpses piled up like mountains in the trenches, and the water was like a sea of blood. By 12 p.m., although the bandits had suffered terrible sacrifices, they were still betting like gamblers, attacking like trapped beasts. Our defending troops, with their vigorous spirit, united officers and soldiers, and exerted their greatest fighting spirit. The bandits were ultimately unable to cross the Lei Pool. On the morning of the 8th, the reinforcements entered the city, and the bandit troops were greatly dismayed. Disappointed, they fled in a panic. At 9 a.m., the bandit troops retreated in three directions: east, southeast, and northeast. Zhengyang was thus relieved. In this battle, the bandit troops suffered more than 2,000 casualties, more than 6,000 fled, and 2,000 were missing. One brigade commander, one regimental commander, and Chief of Staff Xiao Nai were killed. We only suffered more than 60 casualties.

On the morning of the 16th, after the reporter finished inspecting Zhengyang, when I said goodbye to Regiment Commander Zhang, I wished him to always exert his vigorous spirit and not let the bandit troops step into this ancient village even once. He stood at the gate of the south gate, pointed at the south gate, patted me on the shoulder and said, "Please rest assured, as long as I am here, my brothers are here, we will fight to the end even if it is with one gun and one bullet."

阿聯盟拒绝停戰建議後　聯合國臨重大考驗
After the Arab League Rejected the Ceasefire Proposal, the United Nations Faces a Major Test.

英美今後對聖地決策重心已移倫敦會談貝文要求考慮阿停戰條件
The Center of Gravity for British and American Decisions on the Holy Land Has Shifted. Bevin Demands Consideration of Arab Ceasefire Conditions in London Talks.

〔本報訊〕倫教廿七日廣播：本日，英外相貝文與美駐英大使陶格拉斯舉行五日中之第四次會晤，此次會晤，係緊接貝文參與閣議之後，衆信所討論者當爲巴勒斯坦問題。英外部某發言人謂，英國認爲阿拉伯國家仍有接受停戰令可能。某方面謂，貝文曾要求聯合國老盧阿拉伯所提停戰條件，如聯合國認爲無通過可能，則英國可老慮停止對阿拉伯各國之條約義務，而使英國之政策與聯合國之政策相一致。聯合國助理秘書長英人傑克遜已自成功湖飛返倫教，帶有賴伊秘書長之親筆函，內稱聯合國之前途與聲譽，已因巴勒斯坦問題而面臨重大考臉矣。
[Our Dispatch] London, 27th Broadcast: Today, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Ambassador to the UK Douglas held their fourth meeting in five days. This meeting followed closely after Bevin's participation in the Cabinet meeting, and it is widely believed that the discussion focused on the Palestine issue. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said that the UK believes that Arab countries may still accept a ceasefire order. Some sources said that Bevin had asked the United Nations to consider the ceasefire conditions proposed by the Arab countries. If the United Nations believes that there is no possibility of passing them, then the UK may consider terminating its treaty obligations to the Arab countries, so that British policy is consistent with UN policy. UN Assistant Secretary-General, the Englishman Jackson, has flown back to London from Lake Success with a handwritten letter from Secretary-General Lie, stating that the future and reputation of the United Nations are facing a major test due to the Palestine issue.

　　〔本報訊〕紐約廿七日廣播：成功湖訊，安理會今日下午開會時，將考慮向英方詢問是否將繼續以軍火供給阿拉伯國家以及討論應付阿方不接受停戰呼籲之辦法。消息靈通方面認爲阿方可能减低停戰條件，且認爲阿方巳承認以色列國之成立巳爲一已成事實。
[Our Dispatch] New York, 27th Broadcast: Lake Success report: The Security Council will consider asking the UK whether it will continue to supply arms to Arab countries and discuss ways to deal with the Arab side's non-acceptance of the ceasefire appeal at its meeting this afternoon. Well-informed sources believe that the Arab side may reduce its ceasefire conditions and that the Arab side has recognized that the establishment of the State of Israel is an accomplished fact.

　　〔路透社成功湖廿七日電〕聯合國安全理事食定廿七日開會，討論應否援用簽章第三十九條之規定，而對阿拉伯國實施制裁。比間人十認爲阿拉伯之一方而聲明拒絕休戰而一方面則表示願在廿四小時內討論休戰條件，不過爲對其拒絕休戰令之立塲蒙上一層糖衣而已。
[Reuters, Lake Success, 27th] The United Nations Security Council decided to meet on the 27th to discuss whether to invoke the provisions of Chapter 39 of the Charter and impose sanctions on Arab countries. Some people from Belgium believe that the Arab side's declaration of rejecting the truce while at the same time expressing its willingness to discuss ceasefire conditions within 24 hours is just a sugar coating on its position of rejecting the ceasefire order.

　　〔路透社成功湖廿六日電〕安全理事會之巴勒斯坦休戰建議於廿六　標準時間下午五時限期屆滿後僅數分鐘，聯合國當局即宣布，阿拉伯聯盟業已知照聯合國，聲明拒絕安理會之休戰令，但願意談判巴勒斯坦之休戰條件。阿盟以其政治委員會昨在阿曼開會成立之決議，知照安理會，聲明雖拒絕安理會之停戰令，但準備任命委員會，與聯合國之巴勒斯坦休戰委會討論伏戰條件。
[Reuters, Lake Success, 26th] Just minutes after the deadline of 5 p.m. EST on the 26th for the Security Council's Palestine truce proposal, UN authorities announced that the Arab League had notified the UN, declaring its rejection of the Security Council's ceasefire order, but was willing to negotiate ceasefire conditions for Palestine. The Arab League informed the Security Council of the resolution passed by its Political Committee at a meeting in Amman yesterday, declaring that although it rejected the Security Council's ceasefire order, it was prepared to appoint a committee to discuss war conditions with the UN Palestine Truce Committee.

　　〔聯合社成功湖廿六日電〕巴勒斯坦猶太公會今日代表以色列政府宣稱，阿拉伯拒絕聯合國安理會停戰建議實屬罪惡昭彰，欲戰欲和悉憑阿拉伯各國決定，以色列願予周旋。同時，此間各國代表多人認爲阿拉伯之答覆已構成蔑視聯合國停戰令。
[Associated Press, Lake Success, 26th] The Palestine Jewish Congress, representing the Israeli government, declared today that the Arab rejection of the UN Security Council's ceasefire proposal is a blatant crime. Whether to fight or make peace is entirely up to the Arab countries to decide, and Israel is willing to mediate. At the same time, many representatives of various countries here believe that the Arab response constitutes contempt for the UN ceasefire order.

馬歇爾發表談話　美是否解除聖地軍火禁運令　期待聯合國進一歩行動
Marshall Issues Statement: Whether the US Will Lift the Arms Embargo on the Holy Land; Awaits Further Action from the United Nations.

〔合衆社華盛頓廿六日電〕美國務卿馬歇爾廿六日談稱：美國在決定是否解除軍火運往巴勒斯坦之禁令前，仍在等待聯合國之進一步行動。馬氏稱：渠除開自報上讀到美國貨款與以色列國外，一無所悉．渠又明白表示，對以列國之承認，乃限於聯合國分治計劃中所置定之邊張。
[United Press, Washington, 26th] US Secretary of State Marshall said on the 26th that the United States is still waiting for further action from the United Nations before deciding whether to lift the ban on arms shipments to Palestine. Marshall said: He knows nothing except what he read in the newspaper about US loans to the State of Israel. He also made it clear that the recognition of Israel is limited to the boundaries set in the UN Partition Plan.

　　馬氏對渠是否希望英美間對聖地歧見早日解決之一事，拒絕加以說明。渠稱：渠必須首先獲悉，美駐英大使陶格拉斯與英代表廿五日在倫敦舉行會議之結果如何。渠已於廿五日晚接獲報吿，惟無時間閱讀全文，渠指稱：此次倫敦會議乃一特別性質者。
Marshall declined to comment on whether he hopes for an early resolution of the differences between the US and the UK on the Holy Land. He said that he must first find out the results of the meeting between US Ambassador to the UK Douglas and British representatives in London on the 25th. He received a report on the evening of the 25th, but had no time to read the full text. He indicated that this London meeting was of a special nature.

〔路透社華盛頓廿七日電〕美空軍運輸機廿四架現駐在塞浦魯斯島，準備於必要時撤退近東美倫，駐在之飛機塲已與英常局商安暫准美機使用。本社塞島尼柯西亞來電，謂美機包括達柯大式運輸機十六架及飛行堡壘三架。國務部發言人透露前項消息時，並曰：中東美僑約一萬二千三百人，在巴勒斯坦者四千二百名，沙地阿拉伯者五千名，黎巴嫩者一千四百名，埃及者一千二百名。撤退時將以飛機轉助船頭運輸。自美機抵塞島該機塲後，該塲即不許民航機使用。美國軍隊若干，亦隨機抵達塞島，駐在禁區內之皇家空軍營房內。據目擊者言，各機塲均載有武器配備，美軍中並有傘兵部隊。
[Reuters, Washington, 27th] Twenty-four US Air Force transport planes are now stationed on the island of Cyprus, ready to evacuate US nationals in the Near East if necessary. The airfields where they are stationed have been temporarily approved for use by US planes after consultation with the British authorities. A dispatch from our Nicosia correspondent on the island of Cyprus said that the US planes include 16 Dakota transport planes and 3 Flying Fortresses. When the State Department spokesman disclosed the above news, he also said: There are about 12,300 US nationals in the Middle East, 4,200 in Palestine, 5,000 in Saudi Arabia, 1,400 in Lebanon, and 1,200 in Egypt. During the evacuation, planes will be used to transfer people to the ships. Since the arrival of the US planes on the island of Cyprus, the airfield has been closed to civilian aircraft. Some US troops have also arrived on the island with the planes and are stationed in the Royal Air Force barracks within the restricted area. According to eyewitnesses, all airfields are loaded with weapons and equipment, and there are paratrooper units among the US troops.

軍事援助以色列　美談員提出法案

〔路透社華盛頓廿六日電〕紐約州共和黨議員台維資，頃向衆議院提出對以色列國之一億元軍事援助計劃案，規定以價値至多一億元之軍事供應物品及技術援助給予以色列國。渠並主張此等援助，應以租借方式供給，並由美國船舶輸送。
[Reuters, Washington, 26th] Republican Congressman Taviz of New York has recently introduced a bill to the House of Representatives for a $100 million military aid plan for the State of Israel, stipulating that military supplies and technical assistance worth up to $100 million be provided to the State of Israel. He also advocated that such aid should be provided by lease and lend and transported by US ships.

英援助外約但履行條約義務　　貝文外相在下院宣布
Bevin Announces in the House of Commons that Britain is Providing Aid to Transjordan to Fulfill Treaty Obligations.

〔路透社倫敦廿六日電〕貝文外相廿六日再吿下議院，聲明英國以軍官協助外約但軍團之義務，須俟此等義務之履行與英國對聯合國應盡之義務相抵觸時始可不予履行。渠正從事結束聖地衝突之努力，在目前階段中，不願引起其他枝節。貝文並透露，外約但軍團轟擊耶路撒冷之砲隊並無英軍官指揮，目前隨外約但軍團供職之英軍官共有三十七名，係根據英國外約但條約，而由英政府供給，目前在耶路撒冷，雖有外約但軍團在，但並無英國軍官參加。
[Reuters, London, 26th] Foreign Secretary Bevin told the House of Commons again on the 26th, declaring that Britain's obligation to assist the Transjordanian Army with officers must be fulfilled until the fulfillment of these obligations conflicts with Britain's obligations to the United Nations. He is working to end the conflict in the Holy Land and does not want to cause other problems at this stage. Bevin also revealed that the artillery units of the Transjordanian Army bombarding Jerusalem were not commanded by British officers. There are currently 37 British officers serving with the Transjordanian Army, who are supplied by the British government under the British-Transjordanian treaty. Although there is a Transjordanian Army in Jerusalem, no British officers are participating.

耶城美記者採訪不自由　　電話亦常受猶人竊聰
US Journalists in Jerusalem Lack Freedom to Report; Their Telephones are Often Tapped by the Jews.

〔路透社倫教廿六日電〕紐約時報記者稱，耶路撒冷之美國記者，均困居薩爾維亞旅舍中，均以不能確保電訊之得以遞達總社爲苦。各美國記者每日僅能拍出聯合電訊一則，其餘各人所撰之通訊，祇能交哈迦那專差遞至台拉維夫拍出，需時約四至十天。在耶城之採訪，有時悉憑電話，控制電話局之猶太當局，殆對美記者與交戰雙方所通之電話，不時竊聽。
[Reuters, London, 26th] A New York Times reporter said that American journalists in Jerusalem are trapped in the Salvia Hotel and are suffering from the inability to ensure that their communications can reach their headquarters. Each American journalist can only send one United Press dispatch per day. The rest of the communications written by each person can only be delivered to Tel Aviv by special messengers of the Haganah for dispatch, which takes about four to ten days. In Jerusalem, reporting sometimes relies entirely on telephones, and the Jewish authorities controlling the telephone bureau are almost constantly eavesdropping on the telephones of American journalists and the warring parties.

New Medicine and Self-Discipline in the Medical Field   Liang Junqing

In recent years, we have often seen news of medical disputes involving malpractice resulting in death or manslaughter in newspapers. Although the outcome in court is always a declaration of innocence, such "alarmist" news always gives the general public a less than favorable impression. Moreover, our medical profession does not necessarily consider such news frequently published in newspapers to be a matter of honor!

Of course, we are also human, not immortals. We are still at a loss when faced with incurable diseases. Therefore, it is impossible to bring every patient back to life. We definitely do not have such supernatural powers! However, if patients (or their families) have such excessive demands, disputes between doctors and patients can easily arise. This is naturally a problem of insufficient medical common sense among the general public and emotional impulsiveness overriding reason. Besides passively hoping to raise the level of public knowledge and stealthily instilling general medical knowledge into the public, we really have no better solution for the time being.

However, we should say, "The best way to stop slander is to improve oneself." If Zengzi's mother had not routinely given her son the name "Zeng Shen," she would not have been disturbed even if hundreds of people ran past her door saying "Zeng Shen killed someone." Therefore, we think that if our medical profession would pay a little more attention and exercise more discretion when diagnosing illnesses, perhaps many troubles could be reduced! For example, regarding injections, some doctors always want to inject patients with some medicine, hoping to earn more fees. Also, some doctors often comply with patients' requests, regardless of whether the condition requires injection, always trying to find a way to inject them. Disputes often arise as a result, which is very regrettable, isn't it? To be honest, we only need to think, is it superfluous to inject medicine into someone suffering from an unrelated skin disease? If an accident occurs as a result, will there not be a feeling of "If only I had known"? Also, will injecting a cardiotonic (such as digitalis) during an acute heart attack accelerate the heart's failure? And can a person with heart disease tolerate an unnecessary surgery? Are all cesarean sections necessary? Is a plaster bandage applied for two years necessary? (Someone was misdiagnosed by a doctor as having bone tuberculosis and had a plaster bandage applied for two years, and was then diagnosed by another doctor as having arthritis and was cured). Is air needle injection suitable for every tuberculosis patient? Such problems are truly countless. If we were to describe them one by one, it would truly shake the faith of the entire Shanghai citizenry in doctors.

The ancients, like Xunzi, once said: "Things must first rot before worms grow in them; people must first insult themselves before others insult them." I feel that this sentence can be borrowed here. Therefore, I boldly request self-discipline from our medical profession!

### Side Effects of Ai Pei Che   Xu Jin

Since I mentioned Ai Pei Che as a good medicine for tuberculosis in this publication (April 30th issue), many readers have written to inquire about its use. The writers are not limited to this city, but also come from Yongdong, Xuzhou in Jiangsu, Ningbo in Zhejiang, and other regions. What is even more touching is that two armed comrades made a special trip from Wusong Ordnance School for a day to seek advice. It is truly difficult for me to reply to everyone and keep up with the requests. From this, it can be seen that there are many tuberculosis patients (including teachers, students, soldiers, merchants, and various other types). When they hear of a possible good medicine, they rush to it in a panic. Their situation is both sad and pitiful. In summary, the questions are generally nothing more than the following:

(1) Is Ai Pei Che a specific drug for tuberculosis?

(2) What are the side effects of Ai Pei Che? (Because Dr. Liang mentioned in the previous article that the side effects of this drug are very large, causing public suspicion.) -- Junqing's note: Ai Pei Che does have side effects, and I have a lot of experience with this. I will write another article about this in addition to Mr. Xu's article.

(3) Which types of tuberculosis are most effectively treated with this drug?

(4) Can rural doctors use this drug without danger?

I will be going abroad on the tenth of next month, and in a hurry, I may not be able to reply to everyone individually. For the sake of a one-time solution, I will answer each item publicly as follows.

(1) Ai Pei Che is still not a specific drug for tuberculosis. As of now, there is still no specific drug in the world that directly kills tuberculosis bacteria in the human body. The reason for this was already stated in my previous work on April 2nd, and will not be repeated. I once had a patient bring a piece of news from Dagongbao, asking if there was this kind of "Bai Si on sale in the market. (United Press Stockholm, one-day telegram.) According to the latest issue of the Swedish medical journal, Swedish scientists have invented a holy drug for tuberculosis, which is especially effective for treating tuberculosis. However, it is not very effective for elderly patients with poor blood circulation. The drug is called "Bai Si" (Pas), which is an abbreviation for para-aminosalicylic acid. Patients with intestinal tuberculosis experience complete symptom reduction within two to four weeks after taking this drug. It is also effective for treating pulmonary tuberculosis and may have surprising results. This drug does not have serious side effects, and can be completely eliminated if taken with a glass of milk. Tuberculosis experts Karlsten and Sturling have treated and cured 130 patients with this drug since January 1947." However, as far as I know, this drug is not sold in China. The truth is unknown. If it is indeed a holy drug for tuberculosis, it should have been sold to the world long ago. I will be going to Europe next month and would like to investigate and report back.

(2) Ai Pei Che has very few side effects if used properly. The so-called side effects (Effets secondaires) are different from reactions (Reaction). What is commonly called side effects is generally mistaken for adverse reactions. Ai Pei Che is a copper preparation, the main chemical component of which is the sodium salt of (Cupro-alyl-thio-urea-benzoic) acid. If it is used to treat progressive tuberculosis (Taberculose evolutive), it is not only ineffective but can also cause serious reactions, such as high fever, palpitations, asthma, congestion, etc. In fact, patients with progressive tuberculosis already have these symptoms. Ai Pei Che will further aggravate the condition. Therefore, patients who already have a high fever (such as 36.5°C in the morning and 38.5°C in the afternoon) should not use this drug. Also, if intravenous injection is accidentally injected into the muscle, it can cause severe pain.

(3) Except for progressive or active tuberculosis, all chronic tuberculosis can be used, especially for treating tuberculosis with stiffening tendencies. Its effect is to enhance physical strength and accelerate the calcification of lesions. There are often cases where hundreds of calcium needle injections have no effect, but two full doses of Ai Pei have an effect.

(4) Rural doctors also have rich injection experience. If they can carefully select appropriate cases and gradually increase the dose to test the patient's confusion and suitability, there should be no danger.

In recent years, the status of doctors has been completely unprotected. Patients' families often litigate with doctors, and even surgeons are unwilling to operate on urgent and dangerous diseases to avoid disputes. Internists are also unwilling to use strong drugs for the sake of caution. If something goes wrong with an injection, the patient's family will not be willing to let it go, and the doctor's position will be even more precarious. (People with good intentions all regret this.) Therefore, doctors who have no injection experience with Ai Pei Che mostly refuse to use it, fearing that there may be a reaction. Readers from other places often say in their letters that local doctors dare not use this drug, which is expected.

Ai Pei Che is not a new drug. It is produced by Bayer in Germany and has been around since before the Anti-Japanese War. When it first came out, people in the medical community had high hopes for it. However, due to large-scale implementation without careful selection of suitable cases, serious reactions occurred. Eventually, doctors stopped using it and it was gradually forgotten. A person in charge of a pharmacy told me that every time Bayer pharmaceuticals delivers goods in this city, this drug is included. There are no sales, and it is regarded as a cold, money-losing item that is shelved all year round. I also don't know what it is used for. Recently, however, it has suddenly become lucky, and sales are extremely smooth. There is a shortage of goods to meet the demand. This is also a miracle. Could it be due to someone's advocacy?

In fact, there is no specific effective drug for tuberculosis, and chronic diseases are often more difficult to treat than acute diseases. Generally, once the high fever of an acute illness subsides, the dangerous situation is completely eliminated, and recovery is very rapid. In chronic diseases, the bacterial forces are stubborn, and human cells and tissues are destroyed and eroded. Even if there is a magic drug that can kill bacteria, it is difficult to quickly restore health. If there is no specific drug for tuberculosis, it is even more appropriate to focus on cultivating the body's foundation, nourishing vitality, and enhancing physical strength to resist the disease. Cod liver oil (containing vitamins A and D), eggs, milk, and vitamin injections can all be used. Calcium preparations, such as calcium gluconate, not only help nutrition but also make the lesions calcify, which should be a good medicine. If Ai Pei Che is used, it can make up for the insufficiency of calcium preparations. I have repeatedly treated appropriate cases effectively, which is not a coincidence or a fluke.

Another method for treating tuberculosis is to take the patient's sputum, make it into a vaccine, and inject it. This is also a method of enhancing resistance. It has been adopted by a small number of doctors. In theory, this vaccine has no special therapeutic value, but as a foreign object (protein) to stimulate the human body, the reaction is still good when done repeatedly, and it may gradually change the condition. Ai Pei Che is a copper preparation, or it may have this kind of stimulating effect. It is unknown.

In short, there is no specific drug for treating tuberculosis that has "a hundred benefits and no harm." Therefore, all good medicines that can improve the condition can be used, and it is advisable to try Ai Pei Che.

### Common Knowledge About Vaccination   Wu Yiqun

(6) The question of whether children can be vaccinated when they are ill depends on whether it is the initial vaccination or a revaccination, and the severity of the illness. If it is the initial vaccination, because there is a considerable degree of systemic reaction, it is best to wait until the disease is completely cured before administering it. For example, children with anemia, malnutrition, and weak constitution are included. If it is a revaccination and the disease is very mild, vaccination will generally not be much of a hindrance. As for children suffering from dangerous symptoms such as pneumonia, diphtheria, and scarlet fever, vaccination should naturally not be carried out. I think no parents would ever ask this inappropriate question at this time.

(7) Children with scabies or eczema should not be vaccinated. Because after vaccination, it is often easy to carry the vaccine to the affected area of scabies or eczema, and seep into the skin through the broken skin, resulting in local or systemic smallpox rash, which is different from other skin diseases. If it is on the face, it may also cause hateful scars like natural smallpox, "pockmarks." If it is systemic, it can also cause death. If it is during a smallpox epidemic, and it is estimated that the child must be vaccinated, if the range of skin disease is not large, it can also be reluctantly carried out. But at this time, the inoculation site must be tightly sealed with a cowpox cover so that the vaccine fluid does not have the risk of contaminating other places, or ask a doctor to perform subcutaneous inoculation.

(8) Adults who have already had smallpox do not need to be vaccinated for life. If they have only been vaccinated with cowpox, it is best to be vaccinated every three to five years in peacetime, and should be vaccinated at any time during a smallpox epidemic to prevent accidents.

The above are all common knowledge that should be possessed about vaccination. Naturally, there are inevitably some omissions. If readers have other questions, it is best to consult a familiar doctor and ask him to answer them in person. (To be continued)

### Discussion on Hookworm Disease   Tu Wanbai

Although I have been writing medical articles for the past thirty or forty years, I have recently kept a low profile for a long time. However, I still have old friends who frequently ask for manuscripts, so I occasionally write one. Since this column was re-published, there was only one translation of the latest principles of high blood pressure in Western newspapers last year. The "Enemy of the Countryside, Hookworm Disease" on the 23rd of this month was written because the Suzhou Shuguan Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Field sent a letter saying, "Many rural workers suffer from this disease every year. The medical facilities in rural towns are simple and crude, and seeking medical treatment in the city is beyond their means, forming a situation of helplessness." Therefore, this article was written. According to the "New Medicine and New Drugs" edited by the Medical Association, the original purpose was to instill medical common sense in society, not to be discussed by colleagues. Therefore, I tried my best to avoid specialized terminology, using only approximate numbers for various numbers, and striving for simplification.

Mr. Songnian published an article, and the authorities have set up a local disease prevention and control center in Suzhou. Dr. Shen of the Xiangshan Health Practice Center of the center believes that "hookworms are not scary." After reading it, I couldn't help but applaud, thinking that the authorities must have a plan in mind for the hookworm disease prevalent in the Beijing-Shanghai railway area, and it will not be difficult to eliminate it.

However, the article discusses hookworm disease and puts forward discussions on what I wrote, which is very insightful. My humble opinions are stated below:

(1) The anemia problem of hookworms. Mr. Shen believes that hookworms do not "suck human blood" as Mr. Wang said, but only absorb nutrients in the small intestine for a living. According to this issue, the medical community has not yet reached a conclusion today, because hookworms are very small in size. If they only absorb nutrients, why do patients see severe anemia in a short period of time? Other intestinal parasites are many millions of times larger than hookworms, but patients do not have such obvious anemia. Therefore, Osler's Internal Medicine Book says, "Whether the life of the worm depends on blood or not has been discussed many times. Generally, this worm has blood-sucking organs. When the intestinal mucosa is healthy, this worm mainly feeds on food. When the mucosa is infiltrated and thickened, the worm relies on epithelial cells and mucosa for food. Most of the blood is lost directly, but it is also said that the glands of the worm's head secrete a toxin that hinders blood coagulation or can dissolve blood cells."

Later, Tidy's newer Internal Medicine Book also said, "Hookworms live in the small intestine, using their teeth and spear-shaped pieces to pierce the mucosa and suck blood, or secrete hemolytic toxins from their head, and there is very little blood coagulation power.

The above are all excerpts from the latest translated version of the Chinese Medical Association. What I said in my previous article, "parasitism and blood-sucking... and harm caused by toxins secreted by worms" is not fabricated. I checked Beckman's "Clinical Treatment," which has not yet been translated, and the book says in more detail, roughly saying, "Each hookworm can survive for seven to ten years. During this long period, the places where the worm can pass in the intestine are as dense as stars. Each time it leaves its mouth, the bite will bleed for a long time because the worm's head secretes a toxin that hinders blood coagulation." According to scientific medicine, which is changing with each passing day, we should humbly accept it if there is a reason to put it forward.

(2) The problem of dividing worm medicine. There are many medicines for treating hookworms. In the previous article, I only mentioned the most famous chenopodium oil. As for the dosage and the interval between doses, it is also based on Osler's proposal. Now Mr. Shen believes that the dosage is too light and the interval is too long. Naturally, if prescribed by a doctor, it can be increased or decreased according to age and physique. However, for the sake of popularization in the previous article, I only gave a stable and feasible example. According to what Osler said, "If there are still worms in the stool, then take it again, but at the earliest, it should not be earlier than ten days." According to my personal experience in treating this disease, I hosted a church hospital in Changzhou for 20 years. Many villagers suffering from "mulberry leaf yellow" were cured and passed it on to each other. Therefore, the loyal ones often hired a boat to come for diagnosis in groups. Most of them had already lost blood and were physically weak to the extreme. If I were to order them to take worm medicine and laxatives continuously every day or two, I am afraid that the worm disease would not be cured and life would be in danger. Therefore, I fully agree with Osler's proposal.

Free Talk: A Trip to Lingyan   Banmeng

As the saying goes, there is paradise above, and Suzhou and Hangzhou below. I planned a trip to West Lake in the spring, but because there were too many pilgrims, the prices of hotels and yachts all rose dozens or even hundreds of times. We had no intention of offering incense, so we stopped the trip. Then, we shifted our thoughts to Lingyan in Suzhou. In April of the lunar calendar, I made an appointment with Quan Tang Qian Mengsou to meet in the express train of the Jinling. On that day before noon, I went to the North Station to board the train with my friend Yu Jingzhai. Mr. Qian also came to meet. We chatted about our parting thoughts in the train. At 3:09 pm, we arrived in Suzhou and stayed at a friend's place near the Dinghui Temple. It was raining non-stop, so we could not go out.

The next day, the weather cleared. We went to Guanqian Street, took a horse-drawn carriage out of Changmen, and took a public bus to the foot of Lingyan Mountain. After getting off the bus, we climbed the mountain. Along the way, we observed the ancient and modern tomb paths and looked at Taihu Lake in the distance. The sails were clearly visible. We happened to encounter two mountains embracing each other, with a door opening in the middle. The atmosphere was majestic, and there was a small mountain in the lake that protruded like a pearl, standing outside the door. It was called Two Dragons Playing with a Pearl, which was very appropriate. Lingyan Mountain has this atmosphere, so it should continue to develop.

After circling back and forth for a long time, we finally reached the main road to the mountain. There was a spring in a ruined garden and broken wall, making a tinkling sound. We sat on the stone and listened, completely forgetting our fatigue. As Shao Ling's poem says, "The spring water in the mountain is clear, and the spring water out of the mountain is turbid. How is life not the same? Pure and lofty qualities should be sought in the deep mountains and dense forests." Then, we reached the top and first visited the Guanyin Cave, a small cave with a monk sitting in silence. People entered the main gate of Lingyan Temple. A full map of Lingyan Mountain was hung on the wall, with exquisite paintings. There were ponds on both sides. We ascended to the Grand Hall of the Great Hero, visited the Abbot Miaozhen, and sat in the guest room together. There was a plaque in the room called Dongge, written by the villager Wu Guyi, with very fine characters. There was an image of the Master Yinguang in the county, which was very respectful. Lingyan Temple was nothing more than a broken temple more than ten years ago. Master Yinguang lived here, promoted the Zongfeng, and spared no effort to speak clearly, so that this pure land could be promoted and expanded. Abbot Miaozhen was even more able to manage diligently, and fully abide by the last instructions of the old man Yinguang, rectifying without sparing any effort. Everything depends on people, which is even more believable. This is not only true for a temple, but also for governing a country!

Abbot Miaozhen even took out the collected books and paintings. There was a pagoda scroll of the Lotus Sutra written by a calligrapher and painter of the Ming Dynasty, with characters as small as flies' heads, and a book of painted Buddhas, painted in gold on a blue background, with delicate and wonderful workmanship, all rare masterpieces, with many inscriptions by famous people. Unfortunately, due to the short time, I could not appreciate them in detail, which was unavoidable. After the meal, Abbot Miaozhen led us to visit the memorial room of Master Yinguang. After reaching the door, we took off our shoes and put on straw sandals to enter. The room was divided into two rooms, the outer one being his bedroom, with beds and curtains all prepared. Next to it was a chair for sitting at the time of death, with the word "death" hanging on the wall, and the words "Those who study the Tao should never forget this word, then the Tao will be achieved" written below. The calligraphy was simple and had true meaning, which was an immortal brush. The inner room was a study room, with tables, chairs, and bookshelves untouched. In addition to scriptures and commentaries, there were also ancient books on the shelves. After leaving the memorial room, we visited the warehouse, cafeteria, and school, all of which were in order. There were still students studying in the school. After leaving the main gate, Abbot Miaozhen led us to visit the stupa courtyard of Master Yinguang. The courtyard was newly built, with a stone pagoda placed in the main hall. The walls of the hall were written with Master Yinguang's instructions, solemn and solemn. There were four or five monks living in the courtyard, all of whom were ascetic monks, who put their palms together to send us off when we left the door. After the tour, we said goodbye to Abbot Miaozhen and went down the mountain.

When I was in West Lake, I visited the valley mountains on the lake, and the number of springs in the temples on the top of the mountains could not compare to Lingyan. There are several springs on the top of Lingyan Mountain, and there are still six or seven places where ponds can be built below. For temples built on the top of the mountain, water is the most important thing. Without water on the top of the mountain, the monks cannot live in peace. The future of Lingyan is vast and boundless, and the water veins are deep and secluded, which has a lot to do with it. It is expected that great monks will continue to emerge.

### The Justice of the Judiciary   Sun He

The cry for democracy is now uncontrollably flooding every corner of the earth. If China cannot separate itself from the entire earth, then "democracy" cannot just become a mantra. Looking at the newspapers and magazines of the Allied countries, they mostly express dissatisfaction with China's democratic facilities, and mostly cite the erosion of judicial power as an example to prove that China does not have enough rule of law.

If you want to prove it, the best example is the era of the Beiyang warlords' Beijing regime, which was undoubtedly the darkest era in China's political history, although it was already called a republic: corruption, selling out the country, politics based on bribery, killing the people, just as the saying goes, "Small drinks and big banquets, everything is complete." At that time, the judiciary, under this low-pressure atmosphere, did some things that made the suffocating and dying people breathe a sigh of relief. Famous examples include: the Golden Franc case of the Anfu clique, which was reported by Mr. Weng Jingtang of the legal profession, the bribery case of Wu Lianglian, which was also reported by Mr. Luo Wengan, and the massacre of the people on March 18th, which was actually reported by Mr. Dai Xiuzan, who was not afraid of death.

Naturally, under the rule of the Beiyang warlords, the unarmed judiciary naturally had no ability to arrest these criminals. But with this expression, the right and wrong of the world and the justice of the judiciary were raised high. This not only showed the sacredness of the law, but also clearly expressed the dignity of the legal profession, writing a glorious page in the history of Chinese justice. And the holy pioneers who represented the spirit of the Chinese people's protest of stroking the tiger's whiskers without fear of death are still models of incorruptible public opinion, and their voices still ring in our ears. The old saying in China is: "A word like ice and frost, an axe to all ages," "There must not be this thing, but there must be this saying"! With the evil flames of the Beiyang warlords reaching the sky, they could not do anything to these three gentlemen. Although they hated them to the bone, they did not dare to persecute them. This is a good example that if there is a shred of right and wrong in the world, victory will ultimately belong to justice.

Although this is an old story, can we take it to explain to the Allied countries? Of course, what is hoped for is more than just using old stories to explain.

### British Suffering   Xu Tonghua

A British person, in a dispatch from London describing the current situation in Britain after the war, had a section in which he confessed: "I am wearing a suit of clothes left to me by a deceased person to write. The suit was originally very well-fitting, but now it is too big, because Britain has implemented a food rationing system, and my weight has decreased by more than twenty pounds. The pair of ten-inch-long leather shoes I am wearing are borrowed from a disabled person in the hospital. I originally wore nine-inch shoes, but because my socks are patched with rough thick woolen cloth, they still fit. My suspenders used to be elastic, but after five years, they have lost their elasticity. The shirt I am wearing is too tight on the neck and cuffs, and the hem is surprisingly short, because half of it has been cut off to make a collar."

The above is not a special example. Another Mrs. Mai Ling, the wife of an active soldier, could not find a house for a while and borrowed a room in the residence of a duchess. She and her two children slept together on a simple iron bed. The youngest baby was lying in a modified and rudimentary suitcase.

I also saw a satirical painting in a post-war issue of the magazine Punch, depicting the British Minister of Food eating a whole roasted sweet potato by the Thames. Looking at his appearance, it was as if he was seriously tasting delicious foods such as roasted pork and mutton. The same issue of Punch also published an advertisement for Radiac brand shirts that are durable and long-lasting, but the advertisement had a tail saying: "If you are lucky enough to be able to buy it."

When I put these scattered materials together to read, I initially felt it was very funny, but when I thought about it, I felt that the British people were suffering quite a bit at present. If I were in their place, I would feel a little uncomfortable for them. But after thinking it over, I couldn't help but feel respect for them, because it is said that the British people are not without money to buy what they need, but they are limited by the rationing system and cannot buy as they please. The British people's excessive emphasis on practical benefits, such as their firm refusal to return Hong Kong to our country during the Second World War, has been criticized by the Chinese people, but their spirit of hard work and endurance for the country is far beyond what countries that only seek to survive can match, and it is not a new atmosphere of "the British Empire returning to youth."

### The Death of Li Yanqing   Lao Dan

Last year, I read the autobiography "Before I Was Sixty Years Old" published by Ma Yichu, and I listed some omissions and errors in the book and wrote to him, asking him to correct them in the reprint. Later, I received his reply, which said: "Thank you for pointing out the omissions and errors in "Before I Was Sixty Years Old". I will record and correct them one by one. Thank you very much..." But regarding what he wrote. "Cao Kun used bribery to become president, Wu Peifu, holding the qualifications of Cao Kun's eldest son, entered Beijing to clear the emperor's side, and shot and killed Cao Kun's male favorite Li Yan (should be "Yan") Qing, and ordered Feng Wangxiang to leave the customs to attack Zhang Zuolin..." According to this statement, Li Yanqing's death was shot and killed by Wu Peifu. I said that Li's death was not shot and killed by Wu, but was arrested and executed by Feng Yuxiang, Sun Yue, and Hu Jingyi during the Capital Revolution. However, Ma's reply emphasized: "Li Yanqing was indeed killed by Wu Peifu." In fact, this is wrong.

Why do I say that Li was not killed by Wu's clearing the emperor's side? The "Tea Guest Diary" in "The Collected Works of Mr. Wu Zhihui" recorded on November 29th, the thirteenth year of the Republic of China: "When I arrived at the station, Huiqing had already gone to call Uncle Fang to talk about all the recent situations, mostly what was reported in the newspaper, but he said that Li Yanqing had recently been whipped forty times and was willing to pay 170,000 yuan, of which 150,000 yuan had been handed over. He confessed many other things, but he did not confess whether he had had ×× with Cao San."

The diary of December 2nd said: "In the first soldier's room after entering the door, Ren Yan said that it was Li Yanqing's detention place. When passing this room, Ren hurriedly said, "Li Yanqing, Li Yanqing." When I looked, Li was facing inward and wanted to enter the door. Later, he followed two soldiers, probably going out for a walk, and shrank in when he saw a guest. Li was wearing a dragon skin robe, with a tall and thin face, only half of his face." It turned out that Feng and others launched the Capital Revolution on October 23rd of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, and Cao Kun lost his freedom on November 3rd. At the same time, Cao's favorite Li Yanqing and others were also arrested. Wu Zhihui's diary on November 29th and December 2nd still recorded Li Yanqing's recent situation, which can prove that Li was not shot and killed by Wu Peifu. Li Yanqing was detained in the Chandan Temple, which was the location of Feng's Army Review Envoy's Office. After the Capital Revolution, some important figures of the Kuomintang were in Beijing, engaged in political activities. Xu Qian, Huang Fu, and others also lived in the Chandan Temple. Wu Zhihui also often went in and out, inadvertently seeing this male infant Li Yanqing of the bribery president Cao Kun. However, Li's ugly and strange appearance has been fully portrayed under Wu's pen.

Therefore, what Ma said, "Li Yanqing was indeed killed by Wu Peifu," must be wrong.

### Skull Ship   Mao Yi

The "Wellington Evening Post" in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, once published a news item on November 13, 1913, about a British sailing ship discovering a "ghost ship" driven by skeletons. This news was later officially confirmed on the 26th of the same month, becoming a real-life wonder. The situation was as follows:

When the British sailing ship "Joe Sheng" was sailing near the coastline of Punta Arenas in Chile, it saw a sailing ship sailing. "Joe Sheng" raised a signal flag, but there was no response. When the two ships gradually approached, they saw that the masts and sails of the suspicious ship were covered with green moss. It seemed to be an abandoned ship abandoned by sailors.

The sailors of "Joe Sheng" went up, and found a human skeleton under the rudder. The deck was already decayed and could be pierced by stepping on it. Three skeletons appeared on a panel, and ten skeletons were found in the sailors' cabin, and six on the bridge, for a total of twenty terrifying skeletons.

On the deserted bow, the words "Marlborough Glasgow" were still faintly visible. According to the ship's log, it was known that the "Marlborough" had sailed from Lyttelton Port in New Zealand in January 1890, fully loaded with wool and frozen mutton, and had a crew of twenty-three, commanded by Captain Herd. It was last seen on a regular voyage in the Strait of Magellan, and then disappeared. In April 1890, the authorities searched everywhere, but found nothing. In addition to the sailors, there were a few passengers and a woman on board.

After more than twenty years of drifting and wandering, the "Marlborough" was finally found. However, how did two or thirty living people turn into twenty stiff skeletons is still an incomprehensible mystery.

### Raindrops   Shi Jimei

Lonely people are especially lonely in noisy crowds, so they especially like to be alone.

We should rather know fewer people, but hope that all the people we know are friends.

Is a personality without individuality also called a personality? But in fact, there are indeed many people who have this kind of personality.

Whenever I think about doing something, it's almost too late, so there are so many "I wish I hadn't" in the world.

Love without understanding is like a flowerbed without roses and a twilight without sunset. A flowerbed is still a flowerbed, and twilight is still twilight, but it always seems to be missing something.

The same raindrops, hitting the banana leaves and hitting the mud, how different!

No one can be as solemn as the Buddha's image, because the human face is not like the Buddha, so it is covered in gold.

Confusion is not stupidity, but even more stupid people like to regard confused bugs as fools.

When Qing Guangxu was thirty-two years old, I was still studying in middle school. At that time, women's schools were just sprouting, and most women did not leave the family. But foreign teachers would walk around the school with their wives, or ask the students to talk together, which was regarded as normal. Therefore, when talking to the English teacher, Mr. Ham 油克, about the development of women's schools and the prosperity of women's rights in European and American countries, which are beneficial to society and family, China at this time is truly beyond reach. The teacher suddenly smiled and said: People say that there are no women's rights in China, but now the power of the Empress Dowager is so great that not only China, but the world is unparalleled. The Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager, refers to the Western Empress Dowager, that is, the so-called "Cixi". The Western Empress Dowager can establish and imprison the emperor at will, and can kill ministers at will based on her likes and dislikes. Her power is definitely not comparable to that of European queens, but she does not have the qualifications of a monarch. The position of the Empress Dowager in history is very high, and honest people are often used by powerful ministers, such as Huo Guang, Wang Mang, and Sima Yi, who either deposed the emperor or seized power, all under the orders of the Empress Dowager. Xiao Mo Yuan Shikai was re-appointed as Prime Minister and forced the Regent Prince to abdicate, also in the form of Zai Feng asking Longyu to return to the vassal, and Longyu approved it with an imperial edict. The edict itself said, "I have been in the deep palace for a long time and have not heard of major plans," which is also true. However, Yuan's removal of Zai Feng was effective. As for Lu Hou of the Han Dynasty, Wu Hou of
