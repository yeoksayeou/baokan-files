### Li Zongren Analyzes the Overall Situation at a Welcome Meeting in Hangzhou; Confident of Suppressing the Rebellion, Urges Compatriots Not to Lightly Believe Rumors

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 17th] Vice President Li Zongren visited scenic spots such as Huxin Pavilion, Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, Liuzhuang, and Xiling Seal Engravers' Society at 9:00 AM on the 17th. At noon, he was invited to a banquet at Lou Wai Lou by Tang Enbo, Zhang Yanzhe, and Zhou Xiangxian, and to celebrate Tang's birthday. Zhu Jiahua was also invited to participate. In the afternoon, he visited the museum and Zhongshan Park and enjoyed the moon on the lake late at night. On the 18th, he will visit the Yuhuangshan, Hupao, and Liuhe Pagoda areas in the Fuyang District.

[Another Telegram] All sectors of Hangzhou society welcomed Vice President Li at 5:00 PM on the 17th. Li analyzed the current situation on the spot, emphasizing the optimism of the prospects for suppressing the rebellion. He stated: Quickly suppressing the Communist bandits' rebellion is the unanimous demand of the government and the people. We have absolutely no need to worry about the bandits' autumn offensive. This can be seen from the failure of the bandits' previous offensives. The reason for their failure is very simple: the bandits must gather a large army in a small area in order to attack our main force, but the supply of food and ammunition is difficult. This is the main reason for their failure. During the suppression of the rebellion, our side has its inherent difficulties, but the bandits have even more difficulties. The people are threatened by the Communist bandits' rumors and often lose confidence. In fact, although the work of suppressing the rebellion is arduous, there is no doubt that the Communist bandits can be eliminated. Peace is hoped for by everyone, but hope and reality are two different things. We cannot use courtesy with the CCP, nor can we use reason to influence them. The only way is to quickly eliminate them by force. Those who think that the Communist Party can cooperate with other parties do not understand the Communist Party's schadenfreude and their intention to fish in troubled waters. The Communist Party's style is far from the Chinese cultural tradition of thousands of years and can never win the hearts of the people. He firmly believes that the Communist bandits' autumn offensive will be defeated and that the bandits can be eliminated. If the people work hard together, the time for suppressing the rebellion can be shortened. He also said: The Soviet Union has abandoned Lenin's claims of the past and restored the ambitions of Imperial Russia, which is even worse than imperialism. If a third world war occurs, the Soviet Union will be defeated.

[Another Telegram] Vice President Li told our reporter: The scenery of Hangzhou is even better than Guilin. The places he visited such as Wuxi, Suzhou, Wuzhen and Jiaxing, although each has its own merits, are not as beautiful as Hangzhou. As for the suppression of the rebellion, he is confident, and he urges compatriots not to lightly believe rumors and shake their confidence.

### Bai Chongxi Elaborates on the Central China War Situation; After the Mid-Autumn Festival, Bandits May Intrude Again in Western Henan and Northern Hubei; Implementing Total War Requires Political and Economic Coordination with Military Affairs

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 17th] Huaizhong Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi, at the invitation of various newspapers, received reporters for the first time at a tea party at 10:00 AM on the 17th to report on the war situation in Central China. Bai pointed out: The bandits north of the Yangtze River, south of the Yellow River, and east of the Daba Mountains include two major groups: Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng. Chen's main force is in western Shandong and on the north bank of the Yellow River, and Liu's main force is between Fangcheng, Yexian, and Lushan, currently forcibly recruiting soldiers and looting food everywhere, attempting to stir up trouble. These two major groups of bandits have the task of strategically cooperating with each other, but in reality, they stand by with folded arms in every emergency and have never truly cooperated (for example, when Liu's bandits were besieged in the Dabie Mountains, Chen's bandits in the Xiangcheng and Shangcai areas did not send reinforcements). Therefore, in the end, they are individually defeated. If we understand this point, we do not need to worry about the bandits' mobility. As for the bandits active within the jurisdiction of the Central China Pacification Headquarters, they include Liu's Field Army (1st), (2nd), (3rd), (6th), (7th) and 12th Columns, Chen Geng's (2nd) and (9th) Columns, and Kong Congzhou's 38th Army, totaling about 150,000 people. (There are also about 150,000 people in the military region troops of western Anhui, Henan-Hubei, Jianghan, Henan-Jiangsu-Anhui, and Henan-Hubei-Shaanxi). Bai said that the combat effectiveness of the bandit army's field troops is currently not as good as that of the National Army, but the bandit army's military region troops are stronger than our local militias. Therefore, our local militias are inevitably subjected to attacks by the bandit army's military region troops, and even restrain a part of the National Army's forces. In response to this defect, we are trying to equip the local militia cadres and strengthen combat training. Regarding the recent movements of the bandit army, Bai said: When Liu's bandits saw that the Dabie Mountains were exhausted, they sent their 10th Column to the Tongbai Mountains to establish the Tongbai Military Region, and the 12th Column to the Dahong Mountains and the Jianghan lake area to establish the Jianghan Military Region, hoping to prepare for crossing the Yangtze River by stealth. As a result, the plans to cross the river in May and August were crushed by the National Army, and the Xiang River and East Jing River coasts, which the bandit army regarded as their economic lifeline, have been completely controlled by the National Army. Now that the bandit army sees that the Jianghan area is untenable, it has turned to the mountainous areas of western Hubei (the Yuannan and Hunnan area) to stir up trouble, intending to establish a springboard for crossing the river in the area north of Yichang. At the same time, the main force of Liu's field army stationed in Fangcheng and Yexian is also looking to move, and may intrude again in western Henan and northern Hubei after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Currently, the National Army is stepping up its encirclement and suppression separately, and is confident that it will win militarily. At this point, Bai said in a heavy tone: Implementing total war requires political and economic coordination with military affairs. Currently, some people who do not understand the overall situation are using the pretext of reducing the burden on the people to repeatedly demand the reduction or exemption of grain and conscription, which is hindering national policy and cannot be tolerated. In particular, the city defense works of Wuhan are unable to collect civilian workers for processing and construction as scheduled, which shows that the municipal authorities' perfunctory and cosmetic efforts have reached an unforgivable level. I have been ordered to preside over the task of suppressing bandits in Central China, and it is difficult to tolerate this bureaucratic style of procrastination and expediency. I hope that the public opinion circles will uphold justice and correct it together.

### Supervisory Yuan to Propose Corrective Action on Salary Standards for Public and Education Personnel; Finance and Grain Committee Resolves to Request Improved Treatment

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Regarding the issue of salary standards for public and education personnel, the Supervisory Yuan has decided to submit a corrective action to the Executive Yuan. The Supervisory Yuan's Finance and Grain Committee discussed a case at its second meeting held the other day, "In order to improve administrative efficiency, it is proposed that the government make reasonable adjustments to the salary standards for public and education personnel based on gold yuan notes." The resolution was to designate five committee members, including Hu Wenhui, to conduct an investigation into the government's financial revenue and expenditure situation, and to interview Speaker Weng and Minister Wang to exchange opinions on the issue of the treatment of public and education personnel before further discussion. At the third committee meeting held at 9:00 AM on the 17th, Committee Member Wang Guanwu gave a detailed report on the process of visiting Speaker Weng and Finance Minister Wang. Subsequently, the committee members spoke one after another, unanimously believing that it was necessary to submit a corrective action. However, the correction was only of a negative nature. As for the positive suggestion of revising the standards, the meeting did not decide. In the end, it was decided to entrust Sun Yulin, Chen Fangxian, Zhang Dinghua, and Wang Xiangchen to draft the text of the corrective action, the content of which was determined according to the following principles: (1) The government should refer to the ability of the national treasury to bear it, re-determine the salary standards as soon as possible, and try to improve the treatment of public and education personnel. (4) The treatment of staff of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury is much higher than that of general public and education personnel, which urgently needs to be corrected to show fairness. (3) State-owned enterprises have varying profits and losses. Revenue and expenditure should be coordinated as a whole. Those with surpluses should be supervised to hand them over to the national treasury, and they should be used to compensate for loss-making enterprises. Government subsidies should be reduced to the minimum, and redundant staff should be effectively eliminated to reduce expenditure. (4) After the currency reform, the currency value has gradually stabilized, and the price differences in various places have narrowed. The salary payment methods with markups and reductions should be considered for cancellation. Furthermore, there was another proposal at the meeting on the 17th, a telegram from He Yijun on behalf of the professors' associations of national colleges and universities in the capital, transferred by the Education Committee, calling for increased treatment, and a telegram from the presidents of various universities in Guizhou, requesting that the treatment of provinces and regions with reductions be issued according to the Beijing-Shanghai area, which has also been merged into the case.

[Another Telegram] The Supervisory Yuan is actively carrying out its work. The following corrective actions have been sent out separately this month: (1) Corrective action on the price increase of state-owned public utility and transportation enterprises. (2) Corrective action requesting the government to reasonably improve the selection of members of the Gold Yuan Note Issuance Preparation Management Committee, who are not representative of the whole country.

### Low-Priced Purchase of Grain Tax Case

Supervisory Yuan Finance and Grain Committee Sends Personnel to Investigate

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The telegram from the Jiangdu County Provisional Council, requesting the competent authorities to change the central government's low-priced purchase of county-level grain tax case, sent by Supervisory Committee member Ni Bi, was submitted for discussion at the Supervisory Yuan Finance and Grain Committee on the 17th, and it was decided to appoint Yang Yiyuan and Yu Zhenzhou two committee members to investigate first before discussing it further. The original case was supplemented with two points: (1) The purchase price for the first and second periods of the 36th year was 174,000 yuan per market stone, while the market price was more than 300,000 yuan. (2) The purchase price for the third period (May) was 1.5 million yuan per market stone, and the market price was 3.5 million yuan, a difference of more than double. The county's financial revenue, self-defense soldiers, appeasement and other political affairs, and the adjustment of the treatment of public and education employees are all maintained by selling the field tax with market prices.

At this point, the members realized that it was impossible to obtain the accurate source of the news from the Ta Kung Pao building and the reporter who published the news. Furthermore, the opening price of Yongsha on August 19th was 16,800 yuan, and the limit down was 15,280 yuan. Adding the off-site interest for one day, which was 390 yuan, the total was 910 yuan. Based on 30 million shares of Yongsha, releasing at the opening price and covering at the limit down could only yield a profit of 57.3 billion yuan, which is vastly different from the profit figure listed in the newspaper. In addition, the Shanghai Stock Exchange starts business at 9:30 AM every day. If the unnamed person takes the night train from Beijing to Shanghai, they can arrive at 7:10 AM, which is more than two hours before the business hours. It does not seem necessary to be as hurried as "not washing the face or eating," so the factual content is quite questionable as to whether it is the same as what the newspaper published. However, considering the situation of the Shanghai Securities Market, the members believe that similar facts may have occurred. Moreover, the government's reform of the currency system is an important decision to balance the national financial revenue and expenditure and stabilize the social economy. All citizens, based on the standpoint of safeguarding the interests of the entire country, have the responsibility and obligation to support and cooperate with the implementation. If someone takes advantage of the opportunity and their position to illegally speculate for profit, it will not only damage the government's credibility but also affect the implementation of the entire national policy. Therefore, they decided to disregard any difficulties and conduct a thorough investigation, hoping to achieve something to maintain the national law and appease the people's feelings. They secretly contacted the responsible personnel of the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau, the Garrison Command, the Police Bureau, and the Stock Exchange to inquire separately and exchange opinions. They all believed that speculative behavior may occur inside or outside the Stock Exchange. At the same time, with such a large number of 30 million Yongsha shares, it is bound to be broken down into smaller amounts and sold in several pure brokerage firms, and the amount sold by each broker may be around 2-3 million shares.

Agreed Steps

Based on the above analysis and judgment, the following steps were agreed upon and carried out separately: First, among the 237 legally registered firms, those with a transaction volume of more than 3 million shares were selected. The Financial Management Bureau and the Police Bureau were requested to send inspection personnel, divided into eight groups, to depart at the same time to inspect all accounts and the situation of payment and redemption of funds as a basis for research and judgment. Second, based on the sorted and analyzed data and the information obtained, a thorough investigation was conducted on whether the relevant brokers had off-site transactions, the amount of their transactions, and the related parties.

Hyderabad Surrenders: End of the War Between India and Hyderabad; Indian Army Only 48 Miles from Hyderabad City

[United Press, New Delhi, 17th Urgent Dispatch] Hyderabad surrendered to India on the 17th, and the Nizam has ordered a ceasefire.

[United Press, New Delhi, 17th dispatch] The short war between India and Hyderabad ended on the 17th. The Nizam, whose wealth rivals that of a country, yielded to India's demands and ordered his troops to cease fighting. As the Indian army attacked from both the east and west, only 48 miles from the capital of Hyderabad, the Nizam accepted the Indian government's ceasefire request. He ordered the regular army and the hard-fighting guerrillas to lay down their weapons, while Hyderabad's request for the United Nations to intervene had been submitted in Paris.

[United Press, New Delhi, 17th dispatch] As two pincers of the Indian army advanced from the east and west to within 48 miles of the capital of Hyderabad, the Indian government called on the Hyderabad army to surrender on the 17th. The surrender call was broadcast on All India Radio, ordering the Hyderabad army commander to order his subordinates to lay down their weapons, "because your mission is hopeless." The broadcast was made by Lieutenant General Rajendrasinhji Jadeja, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, directly to General El Edroos, Commander of the Hyderabad Army. Jadeja said: "If your subordinates continue to resist, it will only lead to meaningless bloodshed. My subordinates are capable of taking Hyderabad City and will enter the city from several directions at once. Therefore, I ask you, for humanitarian reasons and to avoid unnecessary loss of life, to surrender." It was reported that before the surrender request was issued, India was only 48 miles from Hyderabad City from the east and west, and the eastern army was also 40 miles from Secunderabad. The Bombay Telegraph reported from the front that the army had approached Sadashivpet, 40 miles west of Secunderabad, after occupying the transportation center of Zahirabad on the 16th. Another important force from the west broke through the resistance of the Hyderabad army and had entered Nagapalle, 50 miles east of Hyderabad City. An Indian military spokesman said that the troops had sent troops to less than 48 miles from Hyderabad City. Front-line reports indicated that the Hyderabad regular army had retreated to the vicinity of Hyderabad City before the arrival of the Indian army, and laid out a defensive formation to fight a last-ditch battle, while the Razakars (irregular army) were fighting alone. As a result, the Hyderabad regular army and the guerrillas had a split opinion, and more and more of the latter surrendered. After the Indian army occupied Aurangabad, residents turned over more than 2,000 guns, and a weapons factory was found in the palace of Prince Bela, the Nizam's grandson. The eastern army group was led by the 1st Armored Division, and its "progress was quite satisfactory."

Ceasefire Between India and Hyderabad: The Security Council's Agenda Remains Unchanged, But the Meeting Scheduled for Next Monday May Be Postponed

[Our newspaper report] London, 17th broadcast, Paris dispatch: According to authoritative sources at the United Nations, the Hyderabad ceasefire order has no direct impact on the Security Council's handling of the case of India's invasion of Hyderabad. However, this development may postpone the next meeting of the Security Council to discuss the Hyderabad case.

[United Press, Paris, 16th dispatch] The Nizam of Hyderabad complained to the Security Council on the 16th that India's attack on Hyderabad was an unprovoked aggression. Hyderabad's Foreign Minister Moin Nawaz Jung appealed to the United Nations to stop the attack. Indian representative Mudaliar said that India was forced to enter Hyderabad. He said: "The Indian army entered Hyderabad to maintain law and order."

Mudaliar insisted that the Security Council had no right to handle the matter, because Hyderabad was not an independent country, nor had it ever been independent, so Hyderabad had no right to ask the United Nations, which "can only handle the affairs of independent countries," to handle the matter. The debate on the 16th focused on the question of whether the Security Council had the power to intervene. China and the Soviet Union questioned the power of the Security Council, while the United States announced that it reserved its decision. The Security Council adjourned after hearing the statements of the Indian and Hyderabad representatives and was scheduled to reconvene at 3:00 PM on the 20th.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 16th dispatch] Although the Security Council followed India's wishes and put the Hyderabad case on the agenda, the hope that Hyderabad would receive United Nations intervention is still very slim. Although the case has been put on the agenda, it has not been decided whether the Security Council has the power to handle the case.

United Nations Mediator for the Holy Land: Count Bernadotte Suddenly Killed; Palestinian-Jewish War Reignites

[Our newspaper report] London, 17th broadcast, Amman, Jordan dispatch: According to a United Nations report on the 17th, Count Bernadotte, the United Nations mediator for Palestine, was assassinated in the Jewish area of Jerusalem, and a French army colonel was killed at the same time. The report said that Bernadotte was shot by people wearing military uniforms while passing through the Jewish area of Jerusalem.

United Nations General Assembly Opening Nears: Diplomatic Center of Gravity to Shift to Paris; If the Soviet Union Does Not Change Its Mind on the Berlin Issue, the Three Western Powers Will Appeal to the United Nations

[United Press, Paris, 17th dispatch] The three Western foreign ministers are expected to meet here early next week. If the Soviet Union does not change its mind in the final stage, the three foreign ministers will agree to submit the Berlin issue to the General Assembly. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin are expected to arrive here on the 20th. They and French Foreign Minister Schuman can personally decide on the second step. Since the Berlin crisis occurred, the three foreign ministers have not met. They have mainly consulted by telegrams and subordinates during the summer, but this time a Western foreign ministers' meeting can be held.

Before the last meeting in Moscow, the West had decided that if the Soviet Union stubbornly refused to compromise and refused to lift the Berlin blockade, they would stop the Moscow talks and appeal to the United Nations. It is reported that the West recently intended to meet with Stalin, but Stalin had left Moscow, which greatly disappointed the West. Therefore, the only diplomatic path for the West is to appeal to the United Nations, but in terms of procedural issues, there will be a fierce battle to put the Berlin crisis on the agenda, because the Soviet side will definitely denounce it as a propaganda offensive.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 16th dispatch] U.S. officials remain silent on what the U.S. will intend to do if the Moscow talks unfortunately end in a breakdown. However, the U.S. and British delegations will try to avoid submitting any resolutions that would continue to increase tension to the United Nations for debate. On the contrary, political and diplomatic circles in Washington expect the Soviet Union to launch a fierce offensive against the United Nations, because it has already denounced the failure of the four-nation meeting to discuss the issue of the Italian colonies as the work of "warmongers" and "imperialists."

Soviet Ambassador Criticizes MacArthur: For Banning Japanese Labor Strikes; MacArthur Declares No Violation of Allied Directives

[United Press, Washington, 16th dispatch] Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin, on the 16th at a closed meeting of the Far Eastern Commission, requested that the FEC abolish the ban on strikes issued by the Japanese government on MacArthur's recommendation. He accused General MacArthur of ordering the ban on strikes against "the government" as a "complete violation" of international agreements. The United States immediately refuted this. This dispute has not been resolved, and the FEC has put the Soviet request on the agenda for a future meeting.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 17th dispatch] MacArthur today vehemently denied outside attacks on him, saying that his labor policy was contrary to the directives of the Allied forces, and took the opportunity to denounce communism and the Soviet Union's detention of Japanese prisoners of war without promptly repatriating them to their home countries.

[United Press, Berlin, 17th dispatch] Under the instigation of the Soviet Union, the German Communist Party began purging right-leaning elements within the Socialist Unity Party of Germany on the 17th. American personnel interpreted this move as a prelude to implementing Soviet-style terror rule in Berlin. German Communist leader Ulbricht has set up a management committee and branches in various states and regions in the Soviet occupation zone that can carry out the purge. The Socialist Unity Party was directed by the Soviet Union and formed by the merger of the Communist and Socialist parties in the Soviet zone and Berlin. It is reported that the purge was ordered by the Kremlin.

Relationship Between India and Hyderabad

Our Newspaper Information Room

According to reports, the war between India and Hyderabad is becoming increasingly fierce. India has been independent from Britain for only one year and one month, and another large-scale war has broken out. This ancient country in the East can be said to be extremely troubled. Hyderabad, like Kashmir, is a very serious problem in India. However, our readers may still be unfamiliar with this name. Here, we will provide a brief introduction to help readers understand the recent developments in the Indian situation.

On August 15th of last year, India officially declared its independence from Britain based on the Mountbatten Plan. According to this plan, India was divided into two dominions based on the different religions of the people: India and Pakistan. The former is mainly composed of Hindu people, while the latter is mainly composed of Muslim people. After such a division, the territories划 into the Pakistan dominion were the western and eastern lands; the territories劃 into the India Union dominion were the central and most of the land from south to north. It was a stretch to divide by religion, because there were still many Muslims in the territory belonging to the India Union, and there were still many Hindus in the territory belonging to Pakistan, but in terms of proportion, they were only a minority after all, so this difficult problem was temporarily solved.

But there was one problem that could never be solved, and that was the status of these many "princely states." According to the partition plan, the princely states were free to decide whether to join the India Union or Pakistan, or neither and declare independence. As a result, most of the princely states within the India Union joined the India Union; most of the princely states within Pakistan also joined Pakistan. Unfortunately, two of the largest princely states, Kashmir and Hyderabad, were unwilling to join either side and declared independence.

Speaking of princely states, this needs to be explained from the beginning. There have always been many princely states in India, numbering more than 560, and their total area accounts for two-fifths of the total area of India, and their population accounts for about one-quarter of the total population of India, so their power and influence cannot be underestimated. During the British rule, they also maintained a semi-subordinate and semi-independent relationship with Britain. These princely states were of various sizes, the largest being Kashmir, with an area of 86,000 square miles, as large as France. The second largest, Hyderabad, also had 82,300 square miles, as large as the mainland of England, and its population was the largest among the princely states, reaching more than 16.33 million people (according to official surveys in 1940 and 1941).

The princely states were all ruled by hereditary princes. These princes had their own fiefs, possessed a considerable number of troops, and practiced a kind of feudal autocratic rule. The prince's words were the law, and the taxes he levied on the people were very heavy. The Nizam, the prince of Hyderabad, possessed countless gold and jewelry, and was said to be the richest man in the world. Even the American oil tycoons or automobile tycoons could not match him in wealth.

Hyderabad is a malignant tumor in the heart of the India Union, because its area is so large, its population is so numerous, and its location is just in the heart of the India Union, that is, the south-central part of the India Peninsula. If this princely state is not incorporated into the India Union, then it may be a great threat at any time. In terms of religion, most of the civilians in Hyderabad are Hindu, so incorporation should not be a problem; but its ruling royal family and the land-owning landlord class are all Muslims, and Hyderabad is a multi-ethnic country. Therefore, this contradiction has become deeper and deeper, and finally developed into a war with India.

Typhoon Causes Heavy Damage in Japan: Major Flooding in Eight Prefectures Near Tokyo; 2,000 Deaths, Tens of Thousands Homeless

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th dispatch] According to the Jiji News Agency and Kyodo News Agency on the 17th, 2,000 people have died or been injured in Sendai, which was hit by a typhoon. According to a United Press statistic of Japanese police and news reports, more than 15,000 Japanese in Tokyo alone are homeless. In four prefectures near Tokyo, 12,148 houses have been flooded, and 2,069 houses have been destroyed by storms and floods. Officials told United Press that the typhoon, which swept through the outskirts of Tokyo, had a speed of about 80 miles per hour.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th dispatch] A typhoon accompanied by torrential rain may cause severe flooding in the Kanto Plain. Eight prefectures near Tokyo reported flooding or potential flooding this morning. Tokyo Prefecture also faced the danger of severe flooding last night, but the water has receded this morning.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 17th dispatch] Ichinoseki, one of the cities in central Japan, which suffered extremely heavy damage from a typhoon last year, suffered flooding and fire again today, exactly one year later. The Iwai River swelled due to yesterday's typhoon, and the dikes collapsed, causing flooding. It is reported that thousands of people drowned. To make matters worse, a major fire broke out in a certain area of the city yesterday, destroying dozens of houses in an instant. According to news this morning, the city was flooded at 6:00 PM last night and is now completely isolated from the outside world, and no relief can be carried out. As of noon today, the number of deaths or missing persons is feared to have reached 3,000. It is reported that 16 sections of the railway from Ichinoseki to Sendai have been washed away.

Ashida Invites Nishio to Serve as Deputy Prime Minister of Japan: Currently Seeking Consent from Tetsu Katayama

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th dispatch] It is reported that Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida has asked SDP Chairman Tetsu Katayama to agree to invite Suehiro Nishio to rejoin the cabinet as Deputy Prime Minister. However, it is reported that Tetsu Katayama has not expressed his attitude. Suehiro Nishio previously resigned from his position as Deputy Prime Minister after being prosecuted for perjury and receiving 500,000 yen in political donations in violation of cabinet orders. Recently, he was found not guilty on both counts.

Pravda Publishes Article Criticizing Lie

[United Press, Moscow, 16th dispatch] The Communist Party newspaper Pravda on the 16th accused United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie of siding with the Anglo-American bloc in the United Nations. The newspaper criticized Lie's recent annual report, saying that "Lie's position is completely in line with the interests of the British and Americans, and not with the peace and security between countries. He is not only not objective, but in fact stands with the British and American bloc, supporting the discord in the United Nations."

Special Criminal Court Takes Swift Action: Mass Arrest of Foreign Exchange and Gold Speculators; Sixteen Wealthy Merchants Escorted Under Custody

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday was the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival, and merchants were feasting and celebrating, when the Special Criminal Court took swift action, dividing into eleven teams, led by court clerk Ye Xiao, departing at 9:00 AM, accompanied by the police bureau's economic inspection team, distributing to a total of twenty-one locations on Sichuan Middle Road, Jiangxi Road, Jinling East Road, Beijing Road, Nanjing Road, Ningbo Road, etc., and quickly arresting a large number of private foreign exchange and black market gold and silver giants, totaling more than ten people, mostly wealthy Cantonese merchants. Because of the Mid-Autumn Festival, most of them did not have time to escape and fell into the legal net. The arrests began around 11:00 AM and were transferred to the Special Criminal Court by the police bureau at 4:00 PM. These groups of prisoners were all dressed in suits and ties, but were all handcuffed. They were interrogated by Wang Naizhang, an investigator of the Special Criminal Court. Because the case was serious, they were all detained after interrogation.

This case is not a single case, consisting of Lu Maolin, Deng Zhongjian, and Cui Jiqu of Changcheng Shenzhuang at 26 Qingyuan Lane, Beijing Road, whose crime is private foreign exchange speculation. They transported goods from Shanghai to Guangzhou and sold them for 150 billion Legal Tender. The money was handed over to China Trust Company, which privately speculated in foreign exchange in Hong Kong with the money. It is also heard that this case is related to Hu Guoliang and Dai Jiaju, who have already been detained. Ni Xianzhang of Yaguang Company, Cen Taoting of Lidacheng Company, Mo Minqing of Yongchang Company, Lu Zhaoqi of Xincheng Company, He Pan of Haichang Company, and Cai Jiarui, Guo Hongben, Xu Xiangchun, Lin Xueren, and Wang Wenbin are all suspected of engaging in black market gold and silver transactions and private foreign exchange speculation. A large number of account books and telegrams were seized, and the numbers of ins and outs are extremely alarming. The Special Criminal Court did not have time to question them in detail yesterday, and will summon them for interrogation after reviewing all the files.

Yesterday, when the bailiffs made the arrests, it was noon, and the defendants were mostly happily drinking and playing finger-guessing games. Suddenly, the bailiffs knocked on the door and entered directly. They immediately turned pale, knowing that a disaster was coming, and hurriedly instructed their families before being escorted away by the bailiffs. Relatives and friends, fearing being implicated, also dispersed unhappily.

In addition, Xu Ke, the manager of Huaxin Shenzhuang on Ningbo Road, was arrested by the economic police on the 15th for engaging in foreign exchange speculation and black market gold and silver transactions. At that time, seven gold ingots, hundreds of US dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, more than eighty zoloti, and seventy-two silver dollars were seized from Xu Ke's home. This case also involves Zhang Zucheng and Liu Shijie. Xu and the two were escorted to the Special Criminal Court yesterday and were all detained for investigation.

Socializing – Yuan Yi

The enthusiasm of Shanghai people for socializing sometimes surprises us out-of-towners. It's extremely common for eight or nine colleagues in an office to form a small group and take turns treating each other to dinner every day. Sometimes, outsiders also participate in these dinners, and then that outsider joins the group, and the invitations go back and forth. Every night, after getting drunk and full, someone is sure to suggest "entertainment." Those who prefer quiet activities play cards, while those who like excitement go to the dance hall. They call this kind of life a "necessary social activity." It is said that these social gatherings, large and small, are the best opportunities to curry favor with superiors or seek some kind of position. Therefore, all those who "can get by" or hope to "get by" regard it as their top priority in life.

The so-called "getting by" means being able to move smoothly within a "circle" without encountering resistance. To achieve this, one naturally needs as many acquaintances from all walks of life as possible. Since "socializing" can help "make friends," everyone rolls around in invitation cards every day. However, they certainly don't make friends indiscriminately. Even Confucius, who constantly spoke of benevolence and righteousness, told people not to befriend those who are not as good as themselves. People today are, of course, even more ruthless. Their motto might be said to be: "Make no friends who are useless to me." In other words, their purpose in going to social events is to find people they can use. Since the goal is to exploit, once the person being used loses power or influence, those "getting by" friends will immediately discard them like worn-out shoes, kicking them aside. In the past, people called this kind of kicking-aside behavior snobbery, saying it was a matter of the coldness of human relationships and the fickleness of the world. But people today say that this is "knowing what's what," and it is precisely one of the main conditions for "getting by."

So, are all those who are "made" into "friends" in social situations fools? Not at all. They themselves have attained their current positions by exploiting others. Now that someone is using the same method to exploit them, how could they not understand the principle? So why do they happily mingle together? Because where there is profit, everyone's eyes are sharp. If you have benefits, you will inevitably have to share some with me. Moreover, in the world of bright lights and extravagant banquets, there are even more alluring figures. Checks fly alongside flirting glances, and conscience naturally becomes the same color as glossy black hair.

Of course, there are also people who can never see through the mysteries of this. I have a friend who has heart disease. Whenever he goes to crowded, noisy restaurants and banquets, he often feels dizzy and faint. Sometimes, if people play drinking games at the table, he has to run away for his life. As a result, he vehemently declines all "social engagements." Later, people stopped inviting him altogether, and he became completely isolated. More polite people criticized him behind his back for being "eccentric," while less polite people scolded him in Shanghai dialect as a "fool." My friend gradually heard about this and, in a fit of anger, went to study in England. Recently, he wrote a letter saying that he has job opportunities in England and doesn't want to return home for the time being.

As I write this, another friend walked in. He is a "public figure" who holds the position of General Affairs Section Chief in a certain organization. After reading these paragraphs, he said, "Of course, there are many people in social situations with ulterior motives, but many are just 'going along.' Once you enter this circle, it's as if you owe others a debt, and you simply have to keep going. If you suddenly say you want to sit at home and read a book or go to a movie, people will think you look down on them." He frowned and said with a wry smile, "It's not that I enjoy socializing; I have no choice! You don't know how tiring the daily life of bright lights and extravagant banquets is. Others say we are enjoying ourselves in ease and comfort, but in reality, it's so exhausting that my whole body aches!"

I invited him to have a simple meal at my house, but he said he couldn't because he had another dinner appointment that he absolutely had to attend. He hurriedly left. I know that he is a skilled and witty conversationalist in social settings. But thinking about it again, wasn't his earlier complaint just a formality?

It is said that this is what makes Shanghai, Shanghai.

Art Gallery Drinking Party – Shi Shufan, Kong Wo, Xue Ni, Bai Jiao, San Mu, Yao Yuanchu

When rites are lost, music also perishes; six arts, already lost half. Only the competition truly has staying power, skillful hands entrust soft brushstrokes. Painting is a surplus of calligraphy, its matter not to be idly trifled with. Expert obtains Bai Deng, robustly drives his drunken wrist. Running script and standard script are extremely refined and pure, orchids and rocks surpass the ordinary. Shi Ran indulges in bitter rhymes, hands in sleeves, but claims to be happy. His poems are certainly excellent, only lacking dragon and goose exchanges! Old Sun's vegetables and bamboo shoots fragrant, the rest of his life, pearls and jade gleaming. What are we like? Rather like blacksmithing under a tree. Here we come to share a cup, the clouds and objects, autumn, faint and clear. Leaving the capital is truly reclusive, rivers and lakes, for now, self-exiled. Riding a small car through the city, celebrating, how is it different from riding a humble steed? Still boasting of being near the drinker, pure talk does not lead to chaos. Furthermore, passing Old Man Huangshan, strange writings analyze Qin and Han. (After the party, dispersed with Kong Wo and Bai Jiao, visited Bin Hong's residence) Inside the garden, together with Huang Puheng and Zhang Shutong, composed:

Gazing from the building surrounded by sea air, autumn sky surges with city noise. Returning after twenty years, how many old friends remain? Resentment towards the world is hard to exhaust, doubts about age are self-esteemed. Yearning to visit frequently, not just for pure talk.

### Discussion on Elementary School History and Geography – Shun Xi

In today's educational circles, history and geography are mentioned together; teachers hired also sometimes teach both history and geography. I suppose it's because people generally believe that history and geography are closely related – but I don't know when this trend started?

In fact, geography emphasizes the natural world, while history pertains to human affairs. Their natures are completely different, and the difficulty of teaching them varies greatly. Explaining geography doesn't seem to cause much controversy. As for history, we cannot raise the ancients and ask them, and even if we could, they might not be willing to tell the truth. Therefore, the accuracy of historical facts is already questionable, and interpretations of historical facts vary even more from person to person, making it difficult to reach a consensus. So, those who compile geography textbooks can boldly compile them based on facts, while those who compile history textbooks must be bold yet cautious, with a clear head, or else it will be difficult to write even a single word.

Recently, I read my child's elementary school textbook and had these feelings after reading the history and geography sections. Now, I will give an example from the geography textbook: "The Yangtze River is also called the Yangzi River. It originates from the southern foothills of the Bayan Har Mountains in Qinghai, passes through nine provinces: Qinghai, Xikang, Yunnan, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu, and flows into the East China Sea. It is about 5,500 kilometers long, making it China's largest river..." This is a good piece of general geographical knowledge for children.

I also saw a passage in the history textbook about Wang Anshi's reforms during the Song dynasty. This passage takes the Song dynasty's "excessive emphasis on literature, resulting in a very weak national defense, with repeated military defeats" as the "beginning"; uses Emperor Shenzong's "resolute determination to strengthen the country and appointment of Wang Anshi as Prime Minister to implement new laws" as the "development"; uses "implementation of the Green Sprouts Law, Equal Tax Law, Recruitment Exemption Law, Baojia Law, and Baoma Law, etc." as the "transition"; and concludes with "Unfortunately, most of the officials at that time were very conservative and opposed the reforms, and due to a lack of talent and improper appointments, the new laws ultimately failed to be implemented, resulting in a situation of partial peace." This passage will obviously raise many questions among adults. Today, there are many scholars who hold completely opposite views.

The history textbook also talks about how magnanimous Emperor Gaozu of Han was and how heroic Emperor Taizu of Ming was, etc. I think it's better not to mention these kinds of so-called historical facts in books for young children. Mentioning them will only confuse children when they read other history books later, just like making children who are learning English memorize Nesfield's Grammar, which has the same negative impact. In fact, instead of focusing on political aspects, history textbooks should shift their attention to cultural history, which might benefit children more. For example, in the same history textbook, there is a passage about stationery and books: "...Until the time of Emperor Shun, there were inventions similar to paper, ink, and pens. At that time, they used thin bamboo dipped in lacquer to write on bamboo or wooden tablets. These bamboo tablets were called 'jian,' and the wooden tablets were called 'zha.' The jian or zha were linked together with cords, forming a 'ce,' and the cords used to link them were called 'bian'..." This passage is brief, but I think it's very good.

I personally believe that not only should elementary school history focus on cultural history, but also that today's historians should intensify their work in this area. As for non-cultural aspects, it's already difficult to explain today's events clearly, so why dig up the manure pits of ancient times, or regard the maggots that have long turned into nothing as phoenixes, only to increase people's resentment?

Buying Mooncakes – Ren Qian

It's Mid-Autumn Festival, and although the government has repeatedly banned gift-giving, the mooncakes of several famous food companies are still being snatched up. If you go late, you can only "sigh at the empty boxes."

Originally, I didn't want to buy any mooncakes, but because a relative asked me to buy them for them, I had to go. So, I first ran to "Xing Hua Lou." Based on my colleague Shen Jun's three empty trips (sold out, he went as early as 9:00 AM, thinking he could definitely buy some, but the sign "Please Come Early Tomorrow" was already hanging high on the counter—so he immediately turned around and rushed to Guanshengyuan. Mooncakes were available, but the crowd was as dense as crucian carp crossing the river. People were coming and going, with no free moment. After squeezing for half an hour, he still hadn't bought a single one. Coming out, he was drenched in sweat, and his white leather shoes had turned gray.

To avoid returning empty-handed, I went to Laoda Fang nearby and bought a box as a perfunctory gesture, delivered it to my relative, not caring whether they were satisfied.

East Scales and West Claws – Xian Si

Hollywood has also been affected by American inflation. In 1937, the average cost of making a film was $360,000, but now it averages $1.04 million.

Police in England, Sweden, and Norway do not usually carry guns.

American women's feet have suddenly grown a lot in recent years. The reason is that during the war, women abandoned high-heeled shoes and wore comfortable flat shoes, so the development of their feet was less restricted. Twenty years ago, the average size of American women's shoes was size 5, but now it is size 7.5.

One-third of American soldiers who participated in World War II have gone to school. To date, the total number has reached 4.85 million.

Last year, the state in the United States with the highest cigarette consumption was Connecticut, with an average of 2,393 cigarettes consumed per person.

Anecdotes of Huang Jigang – Yi Yun

Huang Jigang and Wu Jianzhai Chengshi were both great disciples of Zhang Taiyan and both renowned scholars of their time. Jigang was impatient and easily angered, while Jianzhai was composed and had the demeanor of a Confucian scholar. Jigang died of illness first. During the War of Resistance, Jianzhai resided in Tianjin and refused to submit to the enemy, sacrificing his life for his country. His character and scholarship were highly admired by the world. I remember that in 1926, Jigang and Jianzhai lived next door to each other in Beiping. At that time, the Beiping Police Department was strictly conducting household registration investigations. Jianzhai suddenly sent someone to inform me, saying that Jigang was arguing with the police and could not resolve the issue, hoping that I could help. Asking about the reason, I learned that Jigang had recently lost his young son and was in a bad mood. When the household registration police came to investigate and inquired about this child, it triggered his anger, and he flew into a rage. The police were also stubborn, blaming him for not reporting the death, and they couldn't reach an agreement. After mediation, the police still insisted on handling the matter officially, giving him a deadline to report the death, saying that if he didn't report it by tomorrow, he would be punished. So, I negotiated with the district office and finally settled the matter. Not long after, Jigang got into a big argument with his landlord again because the landlord's wife cherished electricity and always turned off the main switch at 12:00 AM. Jigang, as a scholar, was working hard with the lamp on, and the sudden darkness was very disappointing. Although separate electric meters were later installed and there was no more control, Jigang's anger did not subside. On the day he moved out, he wrote the words "The Most Inauspicious House in the World" on the roof beam and left. The roof beam was very high from the ground, and one could not write on it without using a table and chairs to climb up. I imagine it took a lot of effort to write those words. I also heard that later in Beijing, he hosted a banquet for guests, and a certain important person arrived by car, inviting the chauffeur as well, which made many guests uncomfortable. Generally speaking, scholars are focused on their studies and have no time to attend to worldly matters. Even Master Taiyan was not immune, so it is not a fault of Jigang.

My Views on the Painting Art of the Dunhuang Art Exhibition – He Tianjian

In a time of economic hardship, our government did not hesitate to spend a large sum of public funds to establish the Dunhuang Art Research Institute for the sake of national culture. Its aims are truly sincere and grand, and deserve much praise! All of us engaged in painting art naturally applaud! Therefore, when the Dunhuang Art Exhibition was held in this city, I also took time out of my busy schedule to visit it. Now, I will briefly express my views on the great art of this exhibition:

(1) From an artistic point of view, it can be roughly divided into three types:

(A) Brushing Color - In ancient times, oiled paper or lead skin was used to cut out the shape of an object, creating gaps, and then it was placed on paper or other objects, and color was applied by brushing. In the art exhibition, there are those that use only flat colors of green, black, and red, with the edges of the object's form being sharply cut and drawn straight, and the composition is simple and stiff.

(B) Filling Color - In ancient times, the image was first outlined with an ink brush, and then the colors were filled in according to their position. In the art exhibition, there are those in which colors are applied in order, such as using powder on top of ink to create eyes, teeth, and other transparent objects, which belong to this category.

(C) Copying - In ancient times, famous brushes were used to create models for copying. In the art exhibition, there are those in which the folds of clothing of the figures are the same in every piece, which belongs to this category.

The above three types are all artisan paintings. Look at the images of gods in paper horse shops, and the images of the Three Stars, Longevity Star, Heavenly Official, and Harmonious Union in the market. The methods and techniques of their composition are nothing more than these.

(2) From a religious point of view - Most are centered on Buddhism, with others being secondary. At a time when sea routes had not yet been opened, the Central Plains of Asia were indeed in Dunhuang, and all countries in India and the Western Regions had to follow the Tianshan Mountains as a route to communicate with China. Therefore, Dunhuang became the destination for Buddhist propaganda. These kinds of paintings are Buddhist propaganda paintings, as well as paintings of devotees reporting merit and offering blessings.

(3) From the point of view of painting cultural history - Figure and animal paintings from the Tang Dynasty and earlier had already reached perfection in China, with what is called vivid energy and spirit. If you don't believe it, you can test it with various images. Most of them are more noble, beautiful, and good than the traces left in Dunhuang. Therefore, I believe that the murals of Dunhuang may have few Chinese brushes. Even judging by their mood, they often have a simple, robust, strange, abrupt, and stiff flavor, which is rare among us Chinese.

The above is what I have observed. As for what it is actually like, I have not been to Dunhuang to carefully examine the original works and distinguish the details, so I dare not make a final judgment; I am only exploring its origins through the aspects of copying and reproduction.

Although, the beauty of the color matching of one kind of pattern is complete - and there is no lack of famous brushes in one kind of event. Therefore, perhaps some of them were created by famous artists from our country.

I am writing this article not to criticize the researchers and copiers, and I admire their tireless efforts! I only fear that in this turbulent time, young students will regard this as the highest standard of painting art and neglect to practice it, which is a deep concern.

The association's research publications were not complete, so I did not buy them. The reasoning and wording of this article are inevitably negligent, so I hope for your understanding.

### U.S. Ambassador in Beijing Makes a Statement Praising China's Economic Reforms, Considering Them a Genuine Effort of Self-Help, and Praising Chiang Ching-kuo's Speech Last Week as Sound and Clear

[United Press Nanjing, 17th] U.S. Ambassador Stuart stated to United Press reporters on the 17th: The Chinese government's position, after the currency reform, is "more hopeful." He believes the strict implementation of the economic emergency plan has been very thorough [up to now]. Ambassador Stuart stated that he initially approved of the new economic reform plan, "because it demonstrated the courage, vision, and determination of the Chinese government authorities." Generally, things are as good as imagined after the currency reform. If the Chinese government can balance the budget and reduce military expenditures without weakening combat effectiveness, "it will greatly strengthen public confidence." The Ambassador praised the economic reform as "China's first genuine effort of self-help in its revival," which is in line with the general demands for reform movements. Besides this, China will continue to carry out various other reforms to overcome the national crisis. He stated that some necessary reforms are already included in the principles contained in the Constitution, but constitutional democracy can only succeed on the basis of cooperation between the government and the people. Currently, the Chinese people still lack organization.

When asked if the U.S. government would assist the Chinese government in strengthening the foundation of the gold yuan, he said, "At present, I am not aware of how such assistance can be carried out." Finally, he said that he especially approved of Chiang Ching-kuo's speech in Shanghai last week, in which Chiang permitted intensified combat against speculation and hoarding. The Ambassador said, "This speech was sound and clear, pointing out what should be done and what should be avoided. Chiang will definitely not go to extremes."

Continuing to discuss the Japanese peace treaty issue, the Ambassador stated that although both the United States and China hope for an early resolution, he does not know how to break the deadlock. He stated that the main sticking points are the veto power and the organization of the preliminary meeting. If these two issues cannot be resolved, then the stalemate will be impossible to break. The Ambassador declined to comment on the claim that China will abandon its veto power and support the U.S. proposal to convene a preliminary meeting.

Essay

### How Should the Kuomintang Reform?

— Hu Xianxiao

In the spring of 1937, when I first met Mr. Chiang, I stated that although the Kuomintang advocated the control of capital and the equalization of land ownership, the social policies of the National Government were far inferior to those of capitalist countries such as Britain and the United States. If the Kuomintang wanted to eliminate the threat of the Communist Party, it had to move to the left. At that time, Mr. Chiang quite agreed with my words. Time flies, and ten years have passed in the blink of an eye. Although we went through an eight-year war of survival, the Kuomintang has failed to realize the Principle of People's Livelihood. On the contrary, wealth has become more and more concentrated. Powerful families and treacherous merchants have become increasingly rampant. Military morale has disintegrated, and the people are struggling to survive. The Communists' rise to power today is really due to the Kuomintang's erroneous policies. Now, more than 400 members of the Kuomintang Central Committee and Kuomintang members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan held a symposium on August 3rd and 4th to openly discuss how to reform the Kuomintang. Some said that democracy must be implemented within the party and the opinions of party members must be respected; some said that the party's discipline should be improved, party members in politics should be strictly managed, and the Principle of People's Livelihood should be implemented; some said that the party should be representative of farmers, workers, and progressive intellectuals; some said that the revolutionary spirit should be restored; some said that there should be no factions within the party and that the bourgeoisie should not be allowed to exist within the party; some said that the party affairs should be thoroughly reformed in the spirit of the reorganization in 1924; some said that party members should register their property at the same time as they register as members. All of these people were able to grasp the essentials. However, the failure of the Kuomintang was due to the loss of the revolutionary spirit and the failure to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, which caused the Kuomintang to become a corrupt and degenerate group, as Mr. Chiang said, and to become the object of revolution today. The only way to reform is to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, in other words, to move to the left.

Left-leaning is a common spirit of revolutionary parties. The Communist Party is like this, the Socialist Party is like this, the Labour Party is like this, the Anarchist Party is like this, and the Kuomintang is also like this. The only difference is that the Communist Party advocates dictatorship, while other parties advocate democracy. Moreover, left-leaning thought is actually the tradition of Chinese culture. Confucianism is like this, Taoism is like this, and Mohism is also like this. This is why Sun Yat-sen advocated the chapter "The Great Way" from the Book of Rites and regarded it as the highest ideal of the Kuomintang. The failure of the Kuomintang was that after the successful Northern Expedition, the National Government, with enemy parties at home and enemy countries abroad, had to consolidate its power and maintain stability. Therefore, it compromised with bureaucrats and capitalists, those who should have been reformed could not be reformed, and those who should have been eliminated could not be eliminated. Thus, it lost its former revolutionary spirit and became increasingly corrupt. In addition, those in charge of party affairs only knew how to create factions to consolidate their power and did not know how to absorb enlightened and patriotic intellectuals. Therefore, the party power was largely transferred to the hands of party officials, and those who kept themselves clean avoided it. The party was declining day by day.

The way to reform is that on the one hand, the leaders of the party must have a thorough awakening, abandon factionalism, and learn from the political parties of various countries as much as possible to absorb talents. On the other hand, they must actively promote left-leaning economic policies so that intellectuals who love political freedom and economic equality are happy to join the Kuomintang, instead of being absorbed by the Communist Party. In this way, the Kuomintang can appear as a left-wing party similar to the British Labour Party, and the Kuomintang will have the possibility of creating a new life, and China will be saved.

This time, the government reformed the currency system, stopped the operation of the stock exchange, strictly cracked down on the black market for gold and banknotes, inspected warehouses, punished treacherous merchants, and rectified tax revenue, which showed that the government had the determination to implement new policies. Therefore, for a time, it was able to win the trust and support of the people. However, if we examine the regulations carefully, their main purpose is only to establish currency credibility and stabilize value, and they have not been able to use this opportunity to give any blows to wealthy families. Instead, raising the exchange rate of gold and banknotes to the black market level is tantamount to giving legal recognition to the vested interests of wealthy families and treacherous merchants. In terms of rectifying tax revenue, the emphasis is still on increasing commodity tax, customs duties, and salt tax, and they have not dared to impose property tax (or waited for the Legislative Yuan to draft a property tax law). The progressive tax rate of the war-suppression surtax is only as high as 60%, which is far from the 87% of direct tax in the United States. All of this shows that the government has not yet made a decision to equalize wealth. As for the land law, although the provincial governments of various provinces have drafted their own laws, the central government has not yet ordered the Ministry of Land Affairs to draft a national law. Even the 25% rent reduction has not yet been ordered by the provincial governments to be strictly implemented, while the requisitioning of food is urgent, and many county magistrates have been imprisoned as a result. This shows that the government has no intention of saving the general poor farmers. Compared with the fact that the British Labour government has been able to implement national social insurance, there is a world of difference. Because the government still does not dare to levy heavy taxes on wealthy families and the military operations to suppress the rebellion cannot be stopped, it can only exploit public servants. Public servants hope that the difficulties can be alleviated after the currency reform, but the increase in living expenses is very small, and it is still not enough to make ends meet. The virtuous still have to endure, and the wind of the unscrupulous will not be suppressed. There is no hope for a change in the political climate for the time being.

In today's situation, if we want to suppress the rebellion and build the country, and win back the hearts of the people, it is not enough to simply reform the currency system and balance the budget to save the crisis. It is imperative to reform the land and equalize wealth by bloodless means. The Chinese people are indeed poor, but the wealth accumulated by corrupt officials, wealthy families, and treacherous merchants over the years must be considerable. Even if we learn from the United States to levy high income tax and inheritance tax, it will be enough to pay for the current small national budget and have a surplus. There is no need to use new policies to exploit civil servants, or to use requisitioning policies to exploit farmers. Enacting a land limitation law and issuing land public prices to requisition excess land to distribute to tenant farmers who actually cultivate the land is an urgent policy to relieve the suffering of farmers. Do not say that the Communists have abandoned the land reform policy in central China, and then say that land reform can be delayed. The failure of the Communist land reform lies in the fact that the land is divided too small, which is not in line with the principles of agricultural economics, and thus caused a food shortage. If the land reform is reasonable, no farmer will not welcome it. The government must not be afraid of the obstruction of local bullies and gentry, and be determined to implement it, and must give appropriate compensation to the landlords, so that the goal of the tillers owning their land can be achieved.

All of these, the virtuous in the Kuomintang, how can they not know? Looking at the main points of the two reform plans proposed by the Kuomintang members, if we earnestly implement the economic policies of the Principle of People's Livelihood, eliminate the erroneous economic policies of the party program that are close to capitalism in the past 13 years, register the property of party members, increase the income tax rate, divide the profit tax rate, strictly collect property tax and relief special donations to equalize the burden of wealth and poverty, formulate private property standards and levy heavy taxes, and effectively improve the treatment of public servants, if we can implement them, we will be able to win back the hearts of the people and gain the support of the people. If the Kuomintang implements left-leaning economic policies, the Communist Party will lose its support, and it will not be difficult to suppress the rebellion and build the country. The Kuomintang can restore its leading position, and the country will benefit from it. What is worrying is that the leaders of the Kuomintang still do not have the determination to thoroughly reform party affairs and politics. Internally, they still rely on the strength of their factions to maintain their party power and political power. Externally, they still compromise with the forces of corruption and degeneration, and do not have the courage to revolutionize. Then, even if there is a good reform plan, it will eventually be shelved. If so, the goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the country will not be achieved, the national budget may not be balanced, and the economic crisis may not be overcome in the end. Although the Communist Party will eventually fail, the domestic turmoil will still be unavoidable, and the future of the Kuomintang will not be very hopeful. The rise and fall of the party and the country depends on this reform. The leaders of the Kuomintang should think about it!

### Government Adopts Gradual Approach to Establish Income Tax System, Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu Hopes for Assistance from All Sectors

[This newspaper Nanjing, 17th] The Supplementary Measures for the Collection of Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax for the 37th Year have been promulgated by the Executive Yuan. Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu specifically issued a statement, saying that after the currency system reform, the focus of the Ministry's administration is to seek balanced financial revenue and expenditure, and the consolidation of tax revenue is the key. The President's order to promulgate supplementary measures for consolidating finances stipulates that profit-seeking enterprise income tax will be reported and paid every six months thereafter. Income tax is suitable for the ability to bear taxes, and the tax base is rich and elastic. The supplementary measures for collection still focus on taxpayers' declarations and tax assessments. The declaration period ends at the end of September. For those who fail to declare on time, the collection agency will estimate the amount of tax payable by each business based on the member rosters compiled by the industry associations and the local business conditions survey data, and limit the payment within half a month. For those industries that fail to comply with the estimated standards, with the approval of the collection agency, they may request a random inspection of the account books of 5% of the businesses in that industry as a standard for assessment. As for state-owned enterprises and enterprises jointly run by the government and the people, they still need to conduct account audits and tax assessments. For the past ten years, the collection of profit-seeking enterprise income tax has been wavering between declaration, account auditing, and simplified apportionment. The collection method has not yet been established. This is because most of the account books of various businesses are incomplete, the accounting system is not perfect, taxpayers hope to simplify collection procedures, and the government requires tax payments to be deposited into the treasury quickly. This measure is aimed at the current national conditions, extracting the strengths of both account auditing and tax estimation, with the aim of establishing a good income tax system in a gradual manner. It is deeply believed that this kind of fair collection method based on openness has simple procedures, is beneficial to business and enriches the country, and can prevent malfeasance and eliminate embezzlement. It is hoped that all sectors will provide assistance so that the Ministry's work of consolidating tax revenue can be completed as soon as possible.

### Visual Inspection of Industrial and Commercial Conditions in Taiwan, Zhang Zigui and Others to Depart at the End of the Month

[This newspaper Nanjing, 17th] In order to understand the industrial and commercial conditions in Taiwan and to provide guidance, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has recently decided to send Vice Minister Zhang Zigui and Director of the Industrial Department Gu Baochang to inspect Taiwan. Zhang, Gu, and their party are scheduled to depart from Nanjing for Shanghai and then to Taiwan at the end of this month. The main task of Zhang and others during this trip, in addition to inspecting the industrial and commercial situation in Taiwan Province, is to promote the development of industry in Taiwan. Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian has already sent a telegram to Wei Daoming, informing him that Zhang, Gu, and others will be going to Taiwan soon.

### Nanjing District Prosecutor's Office Investigates Tao Case, Sends Letter to Shanghai Inquiring About Li Guolan's Testimony, Yuan Yang'an Completes Procedures and Returns to Shanghai

[This newspaper Nanjing, 17th] The Capital District Prosecutor's Office is still strictly investigating the case of leaking the secrets of the currency system reform. It is reported that Tao Qiming's testimony in this case involves his wife Li Guolan a lot. The District Prosecutor's Office urgently needs Li's testimony for investigation. However, since Li is now detained in the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office, the Nanjing District Prosecutor's Office specifically sent a letter to the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office on the 17th, raising some key points and requesting that Li Guolan be questioned during the interrogation in order to obtain her testimony. It is also learned that another defendant in the case, Yuan Yang'an, was released on bail pending trial with the permission of the District Prosecutor's Office. On the 16th, Yuan completed the written guarantee of 13,000 gold yuan and was released. On the 17th, he took a train back to Shanghai.

### Holders of National Currency Public Bonds Push Representatives to Petition in Nanjing, Believing the Handling Method Is Too Unreasonable and Requesting Revision

[This newspaper Nanjing, 17th] After the promulgation of the National Currency Public Bond Handling Measures, holders of Shanghai National Currency Public Bonds believed that the method set by the government was not reasonable enough and pushed representatives Song Xiemingjiu, Qi Junhua, Chuan Chenghua, Shi Zhuoyong, and others to come to Nanjing to petition. Qi and others arrived in Nanjing on the 17th and went to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Finance in the morning, and to the Central Party Headquarters and the Control Yuan in the afternoon to petition and submit a petition. They also planned to go to the Presidential Palace and the Executive Yuan on the 18th to appeal, requesting the government to revise the "National Currency Public Bond Handling Measures." The main points of their appeal pointed out that the National Currency Public Bond Handling Measures stipulate that the principal and interest of each bond that has been drawn will be repaid in gold yuan notes converted from legal tender at a rate of one to one. The principal of each bond that has not been drawn will be repaid in advance at a multiple. The interest coupons that have not been drawn and the principal and interest that have been drawn will be handled in the same way. All holders of national currency public bonds believe that this method is too unreasonable. The reasons are: (1) The benchmark of the Unified Public Bond before the war was silver yuan, and the interest coupons were clearly marked. At that time, a 10,000 yuan bond was actually worth 70 taels of gold and could buy 700 dan of white rice. Today, it is prepaid at a price 27,000 times that of buying 4 dan of white rice, which is extremely unreasonable. (2) All kinds of national currency bonds that have been drawn are repaid in gold yuan notes converted from legal tender at a rate of one to one, which is equivalent to the government defaulting on its debts. (3) All kinds of U.S. dollar bonds and national currency bonds are national debts. Why is the handling of U.S. dollar bonds unique and superior, and the handling of national currency bonds is so unreasonable? It values foreign currencies and undervalues national currencies, which is difficult to make public. (4) At the time of issuance of the national currency public bonds, in order to attract public trust, whether the customs, salt, and unified taxes were used as collateral for the issuance, and whether a fund committee was established. Although the custodial committee no longer exists, the income of the customs, salt, and unified taxes has increased sharply due to tax rate adjustments, so there is no need to repay them in advance.

### Autumn Silkworm Cocoon Loan, Four Joint Organizations Decide to Suspend

[This newspaper Nanjing, 17th] Regarding the autumn silkworm cocoon loan in Zhejiang Province this year, the Four Joint Organizations previously negotiated with relevant parties and formulated a specific plan, intending to use the order method to handle it. After the promulgation of the Financial and Economic Emergency Disposal Order, the organization was ordered to stop the loan and decided to stop handling the order loan in the future. Therefore, the original plan is actually no longer applicable. It is learned that the recent Four Joint Handling Affairs Meeting had added research and decided to suspend the loan. The main reasons are as follows: (1) After the foreign exchange rate was revised, it was difficult to export raw silk, and most of it has been eliminated. In the future, the silk industry should strive for independent development. (2) After the currency system reform, the market funds are relatively abundant. In order to cooperate with the government's current austerity policy, it is not necessary for the national banks to provide loans for autumn cocoon collection. (3) Autumn silkworm rearing is not as common as spring, and new grains have already been harvested in the countryside. Stopping the loan does not affect the rural economy. It is also learned that the suspension of this loan has been reported to the senior authorities for approval. However, in the future, export packaging loans may still be used to assist the silk weaving industry's export business.
