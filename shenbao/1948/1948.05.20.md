### President Chiang's Ancestors Lived in Yixing During the Han Dynasty

Chiang Cheng's Lineage Moved to Fenghua During the Five Dynasties

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] President Chiang's ancestors lived in Yixing during the reign of Emperor Guangwu of the Han Dynasty. The tomb and ancestral hall of Jiang Cheng, the Marquis of Hanhan, can still be found today on Hanshan Mountain near Yixing. On the 16th of this month, the Chairman visited the tomb to pay respects. According to researchers, the Chiang family was a prominent clan in the Jiangnan region at that time, with the saying "No two Chiang families in Jiangnan, nine sons and eight marquises." Jiang Cheng and his eight brothers originally resided in Duling near Xi'an. During the reign of Emperor Guangwu of the Han Dynasty, Jiang Cheng and his elder brother moved to Yixing. Jiang Cheng was the ninth child. During the Jin Dynasty, Jiang Cheng's family moved to Taizhou. The Chairman is descended from Jiang Cheng's lineage. During the Five Dynasties, they moved from Taizhou to Fenghua. The Chairman was born in Fenghua. However, there are still many people with the surname Chiang in the Yixing area today. Researchers believe that all nine branches originate from Jiang Cheng's lineage. The migration of the Chairman's ancestors is little known to the outside world. This research result was completed by a certain person who spent half a year researching various records. The Chairman's place of origin can now be clarified. Those who wish to be proud of being fellow villagers with the President on the day of his inauguration can use this as a basis for their claims.

### Tillers Must Have Their Own Land, Workers Must Have the Means of Production; North China Suppression Headquarters Formulates a Plan to Be Implemented Immediately

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 19th] Fu Zuoyi stated at a reception for over fifty journalists in Beijing on the 18th that: "Now is the period of suppressing bandits for the people. To promote the power of the people, tillers must have their own land, and workers must have their own means of production. For this purpose, the North China Suppression Headquarters has formulated a plan that will be implemented in Chahar and Suiyuan. It will also be implemented in Hebei Province after it is passed by the Provincial Provisional Assembly in the coming days. This plan aims to ensure that tillers permanently obtain their land and that workers obtain shares in local industries, so as to realize 'self-defense through production.' Rural villages will be organized into levels, and an organization for equalizing land rights composed of the farmers themselves will be formed to implement this policy. Landlords, except for those who cultivate their own land, cannot retain more land. Landlords who do not participate in the suppression of the rebellion will no longer have their land rights recognized by the government."

### Past Resolutions of the State Council Do Not Affect Constitutional Provisions

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The State Council previously passed a resolution authorizing the Executive Yuan to adjust tax revenues in a timely manner during the period of suppressing the rebellion. The Legislative Yuan recently suggested that the State Council request the revocation of this resolution, and that any taxation that increases the burden on the people should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review before implementation. The State Council raised this for discussion at its final meeting on the 19th and resolved that the State Council will be concluding soon, and there is no need to re-discuss and change past resolutions. However, after the establishment of the Legislative Yuan, which is produced in accordance with the Constitution, any increase in tax revenue, except for emergency measures that may be taken in accordance with Article 43 of the Constitution, must go through legislative procedures before being implemented. The resolutions of the State Council cannot affect the provisions of the Constitution and the powers of the Legislative Yuan under the Constitution. This point should be brought to the attention of the competent authorities.

### The Government Is Working Hard to Encourage Exports; Dong Xian Guang Discusses the Situation of Our Foreign Trade

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Director of the Information Bureau Dong Xian Guang answered questions at a press conference on the 19th as follows:

Monthly Statistics

(Question) What are the legal tender values ‚Äã‚Äãof China's imports and exports for the months of January, February, March, and April of this year?

(Answer) Exports in January were 1.738 (unit: 1 billion yuan), and imports were 2.080. Exports in February were 1.724, and imports were 1.969. Exports in March were 3.515, and imports were 6.558. The figures for April have not yet been received from the Customs. The above figures are based on the actual selling prices of a certain port in our country or the exchange rate of the Exchange Equalization Fund at that time, so it is difficult to be completely satisfied with the conversion. However, the amount of foreign exchange purchased and supplied by various designated banks can better reflect the actual situation. The amount of foreign exchange settled for exports was 14.814 million yuan (unit: US dollars) in January, 9.282 million yuan in February, and 10.742 million yuan in March. The amount of foreign exchange supplied for imports was 17.165 million in January, 14.373 million in February, and 14.130 million in March.

Main Items

(Question) In terms of the percentage occupied, what items are the main imports? What items are the main exports?

(Answer) The main import items and their percentages are: machinery and tools 10.8%, cotton 8.7%, diesel 7.5%, gasoline 6.8%, steel 6.3%, paper 5.6%. The main export items and their percentages are: cotton cloth 17.4%, tung oil 12.6%, pig bristles 8.3%, cotton yarn 6.1%, leather goods 5.3%, edible vegetable oil 4.6%.

(Question) During the above period, what percentage of the total imports was purchased by the government? What percentage was operated by importers?

(Answer) The materials purchased by the government from foreign countries, excluding military supplies, account for about 30% of the total imports. The purchased items include rice, wheat, flour, fertilizers, transportation equipment, and some petroleum items.

(Question) During the above period, what percentage of the total exports was sold by exporters? What percentage was handled by government agencies?

(Answer) Those handled by government agencies account for 20%, and the main items include minerals and white sugar.

Barter Trade with Japan

(Question) In addition to normal foreign trade, what was the total amount of barter trade during the above period? What plans does the government have to resume barter trade with Japan? Why was this transaction suspended?

(Answer) The amount of barter trade accounts for about 15% of the total trade. Barter trade with Japan has not been suspended and is still in progress. However, due to the following reasons, the amount of barter trade has sometimes been very small: (1) The lack of Chinese products needed by Japan or Japanese products needed by China; (2) The excessive difference between China's imports and exports in barter trade with Japan, so we have to be cautious about importing large quantities of Japanese goods. (3) The difficulty in formulating barter trade terms.

(Question) What efforts is the government making to encourage exports?

(Answer) One of the government's measures to encourage exports is the "Import Method for Raw Materials Needed for Export Products." Another method is to implement the loan plan proposed by the Transportation Management Committee, with loans from various banks to subsidize production, manufacturing, and trade.

(Question) The "Circular No. 131" issued by the Central Bank and the Transportation Management Committee caused controversy in Shanghai. What are the contents of the clauses of this circular? What is the theoretical basis for it?

(Answer) According to Director Huo Baoshu of the Transportation Management Committee, the main point of this circular is that it is a rule stipulating that importers must convert 50% of the foreign exchange amount of the permit into legal tender at the market price of the day and deposit it with the Central Bank until the imported goods arrive, and then settle the price. This rule aims to prevent illegal profits, because the profits obtained by importers will be several times the cost, and the government and the people will suffer. In other words, the purpose of this rule is to ensure a balanced relationship between the original price and the selling price.

Budget Matters

(Question) Since the government has adopted a relatively open policy on budget matters, what is the total budget for this year up to May 15? Also, what is the total amount of legal tender issued up to the same date?

(Answer) The total amount of legal tender issued up to the end of March of this year was 69 trillion. The expenditure budget for the first half of the 37th year is 96 trillion. The budget for the second half of the year is pending government decision.

(Question) How will the Chinese government use the funds from the sale of materials obtained under the US Aid to China Act to improve its financial situation?

(Answer) It will be jointly decided by representatives of the Chinese and American governments. I cannot provide detailed explanations at this time. However, the main purpose of the US Aid to China Act is to help the gradual stabilization of China's monetary system. Most of the funds from the sale of materials will not be used for the implementation of new plans, so as not to increase government expenditures, but will be used to make up for the current imbalances in the budget, thereby reducing the need to increase the issuance of legal tender. (End)

Editorial

### Celebrating the Inauguration of the President and Vice President

The grand inauguration ceremony for the first President and Vice President of the Republic of China was held this morning in the capital. This is a landmark initiative in our country's politics and the most glorious page in our history. From now on, our country's politics will enter a new era of democratic constitutionalism, which has profound historical significance. After the President and Vice President take office today, the first candidate for Premier of the Executive Yuan will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for their consent and appointment tomorrow. The Premier will then be responsible for organizing the new government, presenting policy guidelines to the Legislative Yuan, and implementing a responsible cabinet system. Thus, the government will not only have a completely new appearance but will also make a fresh start with the people in practice. Therefore, today, all 450 million compatriots across the country are looking forward to the capital, anticipating that our country's politics will gradually embark on the path of constitutionalism and unfold a truly democratic future. They are all enthusiastically celebrating the inauguration ceremony of the President and Vice President with excitement and joy. Everywhere in the country, the streets are filled with vibrant national flags fluttering in the wind, which is enough to symbolize the bright future of our country's democratic constitutionalism. Even the people of all countries in the world, especially those friendly countries that yearn for China's peace, democracy, unity, and strength, are embracing full enthusiasm to welcome our democratic China to appear in the post-war international community with a new posture and extend their sincere wishes.

However, our country is still in the learning stage of democratic constitutionalism. As the saying goes, "Be cautious in the beginning of everything." When we stride forward on the path of democratic constitutionalism, we must be especially cautious, especially to move forward on the right track of democratic constitutionalism. Therefore, while we are enthusiastically celebrating the inauguration of the President today, we must never be forever immersed in self-intoxication, only knowing how to sing praises or be complacent. The most important thing is to maintain composure amidst the jubilation, think more about the future of the country, and use everyone's wisdom to explore the future of China's democratic constitutionalism. At the same time, every citizen should deeply reflect on how to fulfill their responsibility as a citizen of a democratic country for politics. Standing in the position of journalists, we would like to take this opportunity to offer a few suggestions for the reference and reflection of the entire country, both government and opposition.

First, after the implementation of the constitution, whether it is all the policy measures of the ruling party in power or any words and deeds of the opposition party, they must take this Constitution of the Republic of China as the highest standard. Whatever conforms to the constitution is "right" and "good"; conversely, whatever violates the constitution is "wrong" and "evil." Even if our people want to express their opinions, they must also take this as the basis for their arguments to urge our country's politics to move forward on the right track of democratic constitutionalism. For example, the first National Assembly after the implementation of the constitution, according to Article 27 of the constitution, only has two powers that can be exercised: one is to elect the President and Vice President; the other is to amend the constitution. Apart from these two items, everything else is beyond its jurisdiction. Therefore, the first National Assembly discussing current national affairs and requiring various ministries of the government to submit reports during the meeting is, strictly speaking, an unconstitutional act. Furthermore, in the case of the first Legislative Yuan convening itself, some legislators also requested to expand the exercise of the "power of consent" when discussing the rules of procedure, even requiring the Premier of the Executive Yuan to obtain the consent of the Legislative Yuan before appointing the heads of various ministries. We will not ask what sufficient reasons they have for their proposal, but this approach seems to be greatly inconsistent with the provisions of Article 56 of the constitution. The National Assembly has already closed, so there is no need to talk about the past. However, the Legislative Yuan has not made a final decision, so we sincerely hope that the Legislative Yuan will carefully consider this to comply with the provisions of the constitution. Only when the entire country, from top to bottom, unanimously adheres to the constitution and earnestly follows it can our country's politics advance along the right track of constitutionalism; only then can our country's democratic politics have a bright and splendid future. On the day of the President and Vice President's inauguration, the entire country, both government and opposition, must have this awareness and this self-awareness. If everyone can take the implementation of the constitution as their own responsibility, then all 175 articles of this constitution can be fully realized, and it will not become a mere document of black and white.

Second, our constitution is the newest constitution in the world after the war. In terms of the central political system, it adopts a responsible cabinet system. The Legislative Yuan is equivalent to the House of Representatives in European and American countries, and the Executive Yuan is the cabinet in European and American countries. Not only does the President need to obtain the consent of the Legislative Yuan to appoint the Premier of the Executive Yuan, but the Premier of the Executive Yuan must also be responsible to the Legislative Yuan, fully demonstrating the characteristics of the responsible cabinet system. However, the responsible cabinet system in European and American countries aims to achieve checks and balances between the executive and legislative powers. The parliament can pass a vote of no confidence against the cabinet, forcing the cabinet to resign; but the cabinet also has the power to dissolve the parliament and hold a general election to clarify public opinion. In our country's constitution, the Legislative Yuan has the power to consent to the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the power to decide on important national matters, and the power to question the heads of various ministries; but the Executive Yuan only has the power to submit proposals to the Legislative Yuan. In the end, it either accepts the resolutions of the Legislative Yuan or resigns. Therefore, after the implementation of the constitution, even if the entire country, from top to bottom, can faithfully adhere to the constitution and earnestly follow it, if the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan is not entirely centered on "policy," then political disputes will inevitably emerge endlessly, and it will be impossible to seek political stability. Therefore, we advocate that the relationship between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan after the implementation of the constitution should be centered on policy. Some legislators advocate that the Legislative Yuan should have the "power of consent" over the candidates for the heads of various ministries of the Executive Yuan and the ministers without portfolio. If this opinion is incorporated into the rules of procedure, then the history of the early Republican Congress will be repeated in the future. Currently, our country is in a period of suppressing rebellion and building the nation, with many difficulties. We need not only political stability but also a "capable" government. If we cannot make drastic and thorough reforms, then we will not be able to satisfy the people's yearning for good governance, nor will we be able to overcome the current political difficulties.

Third, so-called democratic constitutionalism, in a nutshell, is public opinion politics. Under the constitutional system, whatever policies the government adopts for current national affairs, they must be based on public opinion. Therefore, in today's democratic era, the people cannot but be concerned about politics. But how do the people get involved in politics? We believe that the people should criticize the current national policies and the guidelines adopted by the government for implementation, and use everyone's wisdom to explore the future of the country. In particular, they should create strong public opinion to urge the government to accept the people's criticisms and constantly seek progress from criticisms. To be honest, without criticism, there will be no progress in politics, and it will not be considered democratic politics. Regarding basic national policies, there are also principled provisions in the new Chinese constitution. However, the government should prioritize and weigh the importance of implementing national policies. In light of the current domestic situation, what the general public expects from the new government is the implementation of the basic principles of the national economy, that is, "implementing equalization of land ownership, regulating capital, and seeking the equalization of national welfare and people's livelihood." Today, the people of the whole country are fervently celebrating the inauguration of the President and Vice President. Although everyone has no selfish motives, they all hold a hopeful heart, hoping that the new government can show great courage in the future, demonstrate a revolutionary spirit of daring to act, and thoroughly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood to allow the people to survive.

In short, the inauguration of the President and Vice President, in the process of implementing the constitution, is another step for our country's politics to embark on democratic constitutionalism, but it has brought us unlimited new hopes. The above three points are only the starting point for the entire country, from top to bottom, to work together to reform politics after the President's inauguration. May the President be able to fulfill our wishes with actions after taking office.

### National Army in Western Henan Continues to Capture Deng County; Confrontation Across the Xiang River in the Laohekou Area; Communist Bandits in Central Hubei Slink Into Shayang and Hougang

[Report from Xinyang, this newspaper, 19th] The National Army that entered Xinye continued to capture Deng County at 6 pm on the 19th, and the bandits fled westward in panic. The National Army, which moved from Laohekou to the west bank of the Xiang River, is still confronting the bandits. In addition, the communist army in the northwest of Luoyang is frequently mobilized, and all are now gathered in Luoyang.

[Report from Hankou, this newspaper, 19th] There are a total of three columns of bandits harassing Laohekou, estimated to be about 30,000 people. After the area was evacuated, the loss of military and civilian supplies was quite heavy. The military here officially announced late last night: the National Army in Laohekou had evacuated to the Lengjiaji area west of the river on the morning of the 18th. It also said: This battle has not yet reached its peak, and it is expected that major results can be achieved within days.

[Report from Hankou, this newspaper, 19th] The development of the war in northern Hubei has attracted much attention from all parties. This reporter interviewed Xu Zuyi, Chief of Staff of the Xun Command, and Liu Yinggu, Chief of Staff of the Wuhan Provisional Headquarters, this afternoon. Both pointed out that the evacuation of the National Army in Laohekou was a strategic retreat in accordance with the instructions of the supreme authorities, and would have no major impact on the war situation in central China. Xu also said: After our army took the initiative to evacuate west of the river, we have gained a favorable position. If the communist army attempts to cross the river, it will be difficult to succeed, and he implied that the recovery of Laohekou is just around the corner.

Moreover, the important military towns in northern Hubei are actually Xiangyang and Fancheng. Currently, the defenses in these areas are solid, the National Army's deployment is thorough, and it can launch mobile attacks at any time. Laohekou itself has no danger to defend, and in terms of the current situation, its temporary gains and losses are not worth worrying about. According to the two, who are important officials stationed here, their attitudes are very calm and composed.

### Cheng Cangbo and Others Jointly Issue a Statement Reporting on the News Conference

[Central News Agency New York, 8th Air Dispatch] Cheng Cangbo, Ma Xingye, and Liu Huoxuan, the representatives of our country attending the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press, issued a joint statement while on an inspection tour in the United States to report on the conference to the domestic press.

The statement stated: "This conference passed important cases, including three draft international conventions on freedom of the press, one draft charter on human rights, and 43 other resolutions. The above items will be studied by the United Nations Economic and Social Council and submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for approval, inviting the countries participating in this conference to sign them. Although these documents are mostly close to ideals, they are indeed a preliminary success of the international freedom of the press movement and a major step forward for human freedom. We believe that after careful study by our government and the press, our country will be happy to join."

Looking at the various resolutions of this conference, in summary, one is to seek an increase in the quantity of news flow, and the other is to strive to improve the quality of news. In order to achieve these two major goals, the conference decided to recommend that countries relax restrictions on foreign journalists entering the country, increase the convenience of news gathering and transmission, determine methods for correcting erroneous news, and find ways to fully supply and evenly distribute printing paper and various equipment to various countries. Other aspects, such as promoting news ethics and encouraging journalism education, all demonstrate the conference's efforts towards freedom of the press and mutual understanding between countries.

After a month of meetings and free contact with representatives from 56 countries, we believe that the Chinese press should pay special attention to the following three points in the future: (1) We must strive for and ensure the lofty principles of press and news freedom, and at the same time, we should strictly examine our own responsibilities to fulfill our mission to the people, the country, and society. (2) Any form of government control and private capital monopoly is an obstacle to press and news freedom. We believe that only if the national industry has a sound and permanent organization, manages itself, and seeks its own improvement can the Chinese press hope to move towards an ideal state. Therefore, national press organizations and journalist organizations should be completed quickly. (3) The level of a country's newspapers depends entirely on the cultivation of knowledge and morality of news reporters. The cultivation of excellent reporters is the main key to the future development of Chinese newspapers. The promotion and improvement of journalism education is a fundamental plan for realizing freedom of the press. In this conference, we have made our best efforts to strive for equal opportunities for the development of the Chinese press and the newspapers of generally economically backward countries. For example, the development of national news agencies should not be hindered by foreign news agencies with strong financial resources and a long history. These cases have been supported and passed by the majority of countries. The principle of equal opportunities for freedom of the press and news development is especially what we have repeatedly strived for and has finally been supported by the sympathy of the majority of countries. Today, China's news industry, like other situations in the country, is in a difficult stage, but we firmly believe that China's news industry will gradually achieve success and a bright future due to the joint efforts of the entire news community.

### US Army Department Releases Clapp Report Recommending Further Reduction of Japanese Reparations and Advocating Large-Scale Economic Assistance to Japan and South Korea

[United Press International Washington, 18th] The US Army Department revealed an report on the 18th, recommending that Japanese reparations be reduced to around US$165 million, which is a very sharp cut compared to any previous recommendation. The report also calls for large-scale economic assistance to Japan to enable Japan to export goods worth US$1.575 billion annually. The report also calls for limiting the dissolution of Japanese zaibatsu and other economic obstacles as much as possible to achieve the above export goals and promote Japan's recovery. The report was drafted by the committee led by Under Secretary of the Army Clapp and Economic Cooperation General Director Hoffman, who recently visited Japan, Thailand, and Korea. The secretary of the committee, Johnston (Chairman of the Board of Directors of New York Trust Company and Chemical Bank), was responsible for drafting this final report. The Army Department named it the "Johnston Report." The report recommends that only industrial equipment (mostly war equipment) worth 662,247,000 Japanese yen, valued at the 1939 exchange rate, be transferred as reparations. At the 1939 exchange rate, which was four yen to one US dollar, the yen is worth about US$165 million. The committee stated that Japan's assets abroad, such as assets in Northeast China, Taiwan, and other regions, have fallen into the hands of the Soviet Union and China, and should be formally recognized as reparations and written off. The committee also recommended that even after the US military withdraws from Korea, the United States should continue to provide Korea with "loans, advisors, food, and raw materials" until Korea is economically self-sufficient. The report calls for the United States to provide "strong assistance" to the new government of South Korea. The report states that Korea has been part of the Japanese economic system for a long time, and Korea must encounter the problem of developing a completely new business relationship. It is said that what Korea needs most will be experienced industrial leaders and technicians, because in the past, all of these people were Japanese. The best way is to send senior industrial advisors and business consultants from the United States to Korea, and if possible, to send Koreans to the United States to learn technology.

[US News Service Washington, 19th] A group of American advisors recently accompanied Under Secretary of the Army Clapp to the American military occupied areas of Japan and Korea to investigate the economic situation. Today, Secretary of the Army Royal released his report. The report said, "If the active trade relationship between China and Japan is restored, our country's economic assistance to the two countries can develop to the greatest effect. However, China currently has no significant amount of trade with Japan. China can sell many raw materials to Japan and benefit from it. On the other hand, Japan also has many commodities and equipment that China needs." Regarding the issue of compensation, the committee said: "All reports on Japan have agreed on the following two premises: (1) Japan's industry must be demilitarized so that it will never again pose a threat to world peace; (2) Japan should retain sufficient industrial production capacity to enable it to have the opportunity to develop its economy and thereby provide a barely decent standard of living."

### After the Release of the Clapp Report All Sectors in Japan Enthusiastically Welcome it Believing it is Sufficient to Lay the Foundation for Japan's Economic Recovery

[Agence France-Presse Tokyo, 19th] The Clapp Report released yesterday was unanimously welcomed by the Japanese government and important figures from all sectors of Japan. Japanese government officials unanimously believe that Japan only needs to pay US$100 million in reparations to be safe and sound, even though the Clapp Report estimates that the value of the compensation materials to be moved is US$165 million.

However, Japanese government officials believe that due to the receipt of industrial equipment in Northeast China, Korea, Mainland China, and Taiwan, US$65 million in reparations have already been paid. According to a report from Japan Kyodo News, due to its unexpectedly generous conditions, the disclosure of the Clapp Report made the Japanese financial community here express that the publication of this document by the United States is actually sufficient to lay the foundation for a five-year plan to revive the Japanese national economy and restore the Japanese standard of living to the level of 1930 to 1934.

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 19th] It is believed here that the US Army Department's publication of Under Secretary of the Army Clapp's report on the Japanese reparations issue is aimed at testing the reactions of various countries to the report. Although the report has been submitted to the State Department for discussion by the US Army Department, it has not yet been finalized. Now that the countries involved in the Far East relationship have attacked the report, the US State Department may not adopt the report's views. In addition, according to a spokesman for the US Government Accounting Office, regarding the Japanese reparations issue, the Army Department's opinion is only part of the US government's internal opinion. The US government's attitude on this issue will ultimately depend on the opinions of other units, so it is currently impossible to predict how it will ultimately be decided.

### Japanese Cotton Fabrics Sold in Large Quantities to the Dutch East Indies

The Dutch royal family was not in the palace at the time. Prince Bernhard, the prince consort, ordered the antiques stored in the palace to be moved to a safe area. Because a fire exhibition was being held in The Hague, the fire brigade arrived later. By the time the fire was extinguished, most of the roof had been destroyed.

### Marshall Criticizes the Soviet Union for Not Being Sincerely Peaceful in International Institutions and Reiterates Refusal to Negotiate Separately with the Soviet Union

[Our Newspaper News] New York Broadcast, 19th: Washington News, Secretary of State Marshall told reporters today that the Soviet Union does not have the appearance of sincerely seeking peace through existing international institutions. Marshall strongly stated that what the world needs most urgently is to take active and constructive actions in international institutions. Regarding the Holy Land issue, he said that the United States is currently waiting for the decision of the Security Council. Marshall believes that there are many international issues that need to be dealt with at present, all of which have been disputed for a long time without resolution, such as the issue of arms reduction, the issue of atomic energy control, the issue of peace treaties with Germany and Japan, and the issue of Korea. If the Soviet Union is sincere in seeking peace, it should take active and constructive actions in international institutions and international gatherings.

[Reuters Washington, 18th] The US government has formally rejected Stalin's proposal to hold direct US-Soviet talks based on the open letter to him by Wallace, the US third-party presidential candidate. Stalin's recent diplomatic move was announced by Moscow Radio on the 17th, in response to Wallace's open letter to him, stating that he was willing to base US-Soviet negotiations on the recommendations listed in the letter. The State Department has released a statement drafted by Marshall and President Truman after consultation, stating:

The State Department has learned from the press about Marshal Stalin's statement answering Mr. Wallace's open letter. Marshal Stalin's opinion that a peaceful resolution of outstanding issues is possible and necessary for the general benefit of peace is indeed exciting. However, the specific issues listed in his statement are not issues solely between the United States and the Soviet Union, but are closely watched by many countries. In the past two years, they have also been discussed repeatedly in institutions with the participation of other countries, such as the United Nations institutions and the Foreign Ministers' Conference. For example, the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission and its subcommittees have met more than 200 times, and the committee just submitted a report yesterday stating that due to the firm opposition of the Soviet Union and Ukrainian committee members, the remaining nine countries' acceptance of the war building was unable to be agreed upon, and the other issues mentioned in Marshal Stalin's statement also exist in similar situations.

Earlier, White House officials pointed out that Stalin still had not made specific proposals, and Secretary of State Marshall had repeatedly stated that making specific proposals should be a condition for any meeting. White House officials further pointed out that Stalin had stated that he was prepared to discuss the resolution of the issues listed by Wallace, but in fact Stalin did not know whether the US government agreed with Wallace's views.

### Britain Feels Satisfied with Washington's Statement

[Reuters London, 18th] The State Department's rejection of Stalin's "peace proposal" was expected by people here. After Moscow Radio published the contents of the exchange of letters between Gromyko and Ambassador Smith last week, Britain initially felt bewildered. After Marshall stated his position, Foreign Minister Bevin expressed to the House of Commons that he opposed negotiations with the Soviet Union in the current environment. Bevin's remarks continue to be the official attitude of the British government, so the State Department's statement on Stalin's proposal naturally makes Britain feel satisfied.

### The US Congress Will Make Specific Proposals to Strengthen UN Institutions as a Test of the Soviet Union's Sincerity in Peace Talks

[United Press International Washington, 19th] The US Congress may propose ways to test the Soviet Union's sincerity in exploring "peace talks." Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, suggested that the United States make renewed efforts to strengthen the United Nations. The Foreign Relations Committee is expected to pass his proposal on the 19th. Vandenberg hopes that the Senate will formally express its support for the establishment of the long-awaited United Nations International Guard and the reduction of the veto power of major powers. The Soviet Union has repeatedly obstructed these two matters.

If the United States renews its efforts to limit the veto power in the Security Council and establishes a guard and controls arms with "maximum effort," it can be used as a test of the Soviet Union's sincerity in the prelude to "peace." Vandenberg and people in the Foreign Relations Committee have said that a strengthened United Nations is the proper way to resolve the US-Soviet "Cold War" deadlock. It is pointed out that arms control (including the elimination of weapons of mass destruction such as atomic bombs) occupies an important place in Wallace's peace plan and is endorsed by Stalin. Vandenberg's motion will open the door to this matter, and he also said that there must be "appropriate and reliable guarantees to prevent breaches."

### Britain Continues to Supply the Arab Army with Weapons and Officers for Combat The Jewish Army Defends the Capital in the Struggle for the Holy City

[Our Newspaper News] New York Broadcast, 19th: Washington News, the New York State House of Representatives told the House of Representatives today that Britain is the culprit in the situation in Palestine and continues to pull the strings behind the Arab countries. It believes that if Britain wants to stop the work in the Holy Land, it can do so within 24 hours. It proposes that the Security Council be requested to take steps to deal with Britain and the Arab countries, and if necessary, to intervene militarily.

[Reuters London, 18th] When answering questions from reporters today, a spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry stated that although the war in Palestine has broken out, Britain will continue to allow British officers to serve in the Arab Legion of Jordan; will continue to provide subsidies and weapons to Jordan and supply weapons to Egypt, Iraq, and other countries in accordance with treaties; unless a United Nations institution decides that this is illegal, Britain has no reason to refuse to fulfill its treaty obligations.

[Reuters Tel Aviv, 19th] The war in Palestine has entered its sixth day, and the center of the war has shifted to the city of Jerusalem in the center. Following the entry of the Arab Legion of Jordan into Jerusalem, the Irgun forces, under the Israeli flag, broke into the Old City from the Jaffa Gate of the Old City under the protection of artillery fire and have made contact with more than 1,300 Jews in the besieged Jewish Quarter of the Old City. Haganah said that its bridgehead in the Old City is gradually expanding, and the Arab army is gradually retreating under the pressure of Jewish artillery fire. Military officials believe that this is the beginning of the Jewish army's attempt to regain the initiative from the Arab army, but at the same time, they also pointed out that although the Jewish army in the new urban area of Jerusalem has broken into the Old City and made contact with the Jewish army in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City, the main force of the entire army in Jerusalem, about 50,000 people, is now concentrated in the coastal plain area to defend the capital Tel Aviv.

### The Issue of Forcing an Arab-Jewish Truce: The Security Council Finds It Difficult to Reach an Agreement; Jiang Tingfu Expresses His Views to Reporters

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] New York, 19th (Radio): Lake Success Dispatch ‚Äì Chinese representative to the Security Council, Jiang Tingfu, stated during an interview with reporters that he doubts the Security Council can quickly agree to take strong action to stop the fighting in Palestine. Due to the existence of the veto power in the Security Council, it is difficult for the five major powers to take unified action. Although the Soviet Union seems to support the United States' position on the issue of a truce in the Holy Land, taking concrete action is another matter. Jiang believes that it is too early to talk about China recognizing the State of Israel.

[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] On the 18th, Jiang Tingfu, the Chinese representative to the United Nations, expressed great doubts as to whether the Security Council would approve any forceful steps to prevent the fighting in Palestine.

When Jiang was interviewed by reporters, he was asked if he agreed with the prediction that the five major powers would not be able to reach an agreement on rapid steps to prevent the fighting in Palestine.

Zafarullah also stated that the Islamic Alliance passed a resolution requesting full assistance to the Arabs of Palestine, and the Pakistani government is seriously considering this matter.

### Jewish People Again Ask the British Government to Recognize Israel

Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Other Countries Have Already Recognized It

[Reuters, London, 19th] A British Foreign Office spokesperson said that Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok has sent a telegram to the British government requesting that Britain recognize Israel. Britain is still studying this request.

He mentioned Churchill, believing that the Conservative Party currently has no attractive policies, only rotten, stinking fish.

### It Is Widely Rumored that Kim Gu Intends to Retire Temporarily; The Korean Government May Be Established Next Month

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 18th] It is learned that Kim Gu, leader of the Korean Independence Party and former Chairman of the Korean Provisional Government in Chongqing, has decided to retire to Myeongsa Temple, about 40 to 50 miles south of Seoul, for two or three years. This will lead to new developments in the South Korean political situation. According to people close to Kim Gu, Kim knows that he cannot achieve Korean independence at this time, so he is willing to retire temporarily, and will come out again when independence is in sight to do his best.

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 19th] According to Korean sources, the Korean government will be established by the end of June, at the latest by July 15th. The South Korean Interim Legislative Assembly has decided to dissolve on the 20th, so that it can be succeeded by a newly elected parliament. It is reported that the South Korean Election Committee is consulting with the US military government to determine the opening date of the new parliament, so as to elect the president, vice president, and cabinet members.

### Future Negotiations on a Peace Treaty with Japan: Australia Agrees to Retain the Veto Power

[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] The official newspaper of the British occupation forces published a dispatch from its correspondent in Australia, suggesting that Australia may join the Soviet Union in demanding the maintenance of veto power in the Japanese peace treaty negotiations. The correspondent said that the Australian government is apparently less distrustful of the Soviet Union than other dominions. It is generally believed that the Australian government no longer opposes the retention of veto power by the major powers in the Japanese peace treaty negotiations. It has been reported that official sources have not formally commented on this report from the newspaper, but US sources have admitted that Australia's policy towards Japan has indeed changed recently. For example, Paul, the Australian representative to the Allied Council for Japan, has repeatedly criticized US policy towards Japan, especially the US claims that Japan's democratization has been successful, and that Japan should become an anti-communist fortress in the Far East.

### Representatives of the National Bank Negotiate with the Hong Kong Government: Eliminating the Free Market in Hong Kong

A new Sino-Hong Kong agreement is under negotiation between the Chinese and Hong Kong governments, and will soon be finalized. After the establishment of the new government, a final decision can be made. According to inquiries from relevant parties, the principle of the new Sino-Hong Kong agreement is to control the Hong Kong market. The implementation steps will be to eliminate free trade in Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong government will prohibit the establishment of commercial and financial institutions with a high degree of speculation. If this can be achieved, it will eliminate black market activities in gold and banknotes, which will greatly benefit the stability of our finances. This matter is being negotiated by the representative of the Central Bank stationed in Hong Kong, and it is reported that the Hong Kong government has expressed its willingness to assist.

According to news from the Central Bank, Mr. Yu Yingjie, the bank's representative in Hong Kong, has recently negotiated with the Hong Kong authorities again on the financial part of the Sino-Hong Kong economic agreement. However, it is generally believed that it is difficult to say whether this matter can achieve the desired results. The current prosperity of Hong Kong comes from abnormal financial speculation, and if the financial part of the Sino-Hong Kong agreement is implemented, the Hong Kong authorities must assist the Chinese government in strictly controlling speculative funds in Hong Kong engaged in foreign exchange and gold banknote speculation. This is tantamount to asking those who make money from the country's difficulties to donate all their wealth and prohibit them from speculating again.

### Prices Rise Frequently in Production Areas: Rice Prices Reach New Highs Repeatedly; Few People Apply to Purchase Rice Sold by the People's Livelihood Adjustment Association

The rice market continues to rise. Because the price of rice in production areas such as Wuxi is high, merchants rarely sell because of the high cost and want to raise prices. In addition, the arrival of goods is scarce and the supply is not abundant, so the price rises. The market price in the northern city is 5.7 million for white japonica rice and 5.75 million for thin paddy rice, an increase of 100,000 to 150,000 yuan. The price of the early indica rice and the late indica rice in the port has increased by 200,000 yuan. The price in the southern city has also increased by 200,000 yuan, and the price of white round grain rice has reached a high of 7 million. The People's Livelihood Adjustment Association sold two types of rice, white japonica rice and common indica rice, in the northern and southern cities, half and half. The price of the former was 5.4 million yuan, and the price of the latter was 5.2 million yuan, but few people applied to purchase, and a total of only 2,344 piculs were sold. The total of goods received in the two cities including rice that was sold was 5,532 piculs.

Flour: The price has risen again. As prices in Suzhou and Wuxi have risen, those who hold the goods have successively raised prices. Moreover, the price of rice and other goods on the open market have all increased, so people unanimously expect prices to rise. The initial price of "Old Car" and "Warship" brand flour was 1.88 million yuan, but the China Trust Bureau sold 28,500 bags at a price of 1.8 million yuan, which stopped the rising trend. The closing price of "Old Car" and "Warship" brand flour was 1.85 million yuan, and the closing price of "Red Bee" and "Built" brand flour was 1.82 million yuan, each rising by 20,000 yuan. The price of bran turned firm at 60,000 yuan, and the price of wheat at the flour mill increased by 150,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains: The price continues to rise. Merchants from other provinces have continued to inquire about goods, and the market situation is very good. In addition, the price of rice and other goods on the open market have all increased, so the owners of the goods are doing their best to raise prices. The price of soybeans in the market is firm, and the sales of corn and mung beans are sluggish and the price is flat. The price of red beans, sesame seeds, and raw peanuts have all risen. The final price of raw peanuts from Qinhuangdao was 12 million yuan, a sharp increase of 2 million yuan, and the price of other raw peanuts also increased by 1.5 million yuan.

Cooking Oil: The opening price is also high, and retailers are holding on to the goods even more strongly. The price of new soybean oil from Dayou and Dachang once reached 14.2 million yuan, and the market price later fell slightly, closing at 13.9 million yuan, still an increase of 890,000 yuan. The price of raw oil increased by 780,000 yuan. The price of soybean cake initially increased by 100,000 yuan, but actual sales were sluggish and mostly speculative, so the market price fell later, increasing by 780,000 yuan.

### Market Conditions in Various Places

Suzhou: [Our Newspaper's Dispatch, Suzhou, 19th] The price of rice in Suzhou today has risen again because of the continuous price increases in neighboring areas and people's anxiety has increased. The market price for early japonica brown rice is 4.95 million yuan, and the market price for white rice is 5.5 million yuan. The retail price for white rice has reached a high of 6 million yuan.

Wuxi: [Our Newspaper's Dispatch, Wuxi, 19th] Today, commodity prices fluctuated greatly and people were confused. There was a severe shortage of rice and paddy rice. The open market price was 5.726 million yuan, the price of late indica rice was 5.676 million yuan, the price of wheat was 5 million yuan, the price of white wheat was 5.15 million yuan, the price of flour was 1.9 million yuan, the price of soybean oil was 1.395 million yuan, and the price of cotton yarn was 21.95 million yuan.

Zhenjiang: [Our Newspaper's Dispatch, Zhenjiang, 19th] The provincial government has issued another telegram to the city and county governments, ordering them to quickly find ways to stabilize prices and strictly crack down on hoarding, and to dredge the sources of grain because the prices of food and daily necessities have risen again recently.

The prices of yarn, cloth, grain, and oil have all risen sharply.

Tongzhou: [Our Newspaper's Dispatch, Nantong, 19th] After the adjustment of foreign exchange rates, the market has reacted only slightly, but the prices of various goods have fallen generally and have risen again. The price of fine cloth has increased by 100,000 yuan. There is a price but no market for miscellaneous grains, and all five foreign brands of cigarettes are selling well.

Chengdu: [Our Newspaper's Dispatch, Chengdu, 19th] The rising price of rice in Chengdu has not stopped. On the 19th, the price was 8.28 million yuan per double dan. The provincial and municipal governments have decided to allocate rice to households according to the average amount starting tomorrow. The price of rice throughout Sichuan has recently increased dramatically.

Guangzhou: [Our Newspaper's Dispatch, Guangzhou, 19th] The financial market in Guangzhou continues to fluctuate. However, because of the large amount of rice sold, the price of rice once fell by 100,000 yuan per dan. Although the market price has risen again later, the rising trend has slowed down.

### The Textile Export Association Launches an Investigation of the Yarn and Cloth Market in the Dutch East Indies

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Textile Export Association:

(1) In order to understand the situation of the yarn and cloth market in the Dutch East Indies, the Association has decided to invite one representative from the Textile Construction Company, two representatives from private factories, and one representative from the cotton weaving industry to go to the Dutch East Indies, Bangkok, Singapore, Manila, Saigon, and other places to conduct an on-site investigation.

(2) In the first batch of 100,000 bales of US loan cotton, a portion must be paid for by our government first. However, the price of US cotton is too high, and the raw materials for textiles require a combination of various types of cotton. If all US cotton is used, it is not economical. Therefore, the Textile Export Association suggests that the funds paid by our country be used to purchase other suitable types of cotton for allocation.

(3) In order to facilitate the selection and purchase of suitable foreign cotton, the Association is currently organizing a technical committee for the selection and purchase of foreign cotton, which will be organized by experts recommended by state-owned and private factories and hired by the Association.

Yarn Prices Rise Again: Yesterday's cotton yarn market initially had a lot of good news. In addition, the Textile Construction Company allocated little yarn, and merchants from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other provinces continued to purchase goods. The market was full of enthusiasm. The opening price of 42-count "Blue Phoenix" fine yarn was as high as 300.5 million yuan. Later, the authorities put up another sign for tender, and people gradually became timid, with fewer buyers. The final price fell slightly to close at 291.2 million yuan, an increase of 2.1 million yuan compared to the previous day.

The prices of various brands of 40-count yarn have fallen by 1 million to 7.8 million yuan because of oversupply. 21-count "Double Horse" yarn is the target of speculators, and arbitrage transactions are still active, with the market price increasing by 15 million yuan. The prices of other coarse yarns such as 32-count, 20-count, and 16-count have all risen generally.

Cotton Cloth Prices Rise Sharply: Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened with steady to firm prices, and people were optimistic about the market. The opening price of 12-pound "Leading Brand" fine cloth immediately jumped by 200,000 yuan, and transactions were very active, with prices rising to 6.5 million yuan. Although prices once hesitated around 500,000 yuan, a large amount of goods were purchased by merchants from Tianjin, and yarn prices rose again. The market was full of buying interest, and the market rose sharply in a straight line, rising to a closing price of 6.65 million yuan, a sharp increase of 400,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The price on the open market was about 200,000 yuan higher. The prices of other fine cloth, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, and serge have also generally increased by 340,000 yuan. The prices of colored cloth and shirting from the factory have been slightly adjusted, increasing by 350,000 yuan.

Also, the five-blessing fine cloth allocated by the Textile Construction Company on the previous day was allowed to increase the purchase order by 423,000 yuan, and the transaction price was 6.4 million yuan. Because dyeing factories were purchasing goods, the purchase order for 20-count extra-fine cloth increased by 300,000 yuan, and the price was 5.8 million yuan before it was sold. The market atmosphere was firm and stable. The national banks have reduced the domestic exchange rate in various places again as follows: Guangzhou 60 yuan per 1,000 yuan (originally 120 yuan), Shantou and Haikou 100 yuan (originally 150 yuan), other places in Guangdong 100 yuan (originally 150 yuan), Xiamen 90 yuan (originally 100 yuan), Fuzhou 50 yuan (originally 70 yuan), Quanzhou 100 yuan (originally 110 yuan), Liuzhou, Wuzhou, and Nanning 70 yuan (originally 80 yuan), Changsha 30 yuan (originally 70 yuan), Hengyang 40 yuan (originally 80 yuan), other places in Hunan 60 yuan (originally 100 yuan), Hankou and Wuchang 40 yuan (originally 70 yuan), Nanchang 20 yuan (originally 30 yuan), Jiujiang 30 yuan (originally 40 yuan), and other places have not changed.

### The Gold Control Bureau is Actively Preparing to Establish a Secret Tip-Off Bonus Committee

It is learned that the organization of the Gold Control Bureau that rewards secret tip-offs about private black market gold banknotes is currently being actively prepared. Because the Gold Control Bureau has received many secret tip-offs recently, and the previous few times it cracked down on black market gold banknotes, it relied heavily on secret tip-offs. Therefore, this secret tip-off bonus must be issued on a regular basis to show credibility. It is also understood that the organization has now been named the Secret Tip-Off Bonus Committee, which will be organized by the Gold Control Bureau and the heads of responsible agencies and financial institutions in this city.

### The Silk Committee Revises the Purchase Prices in Various Regions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] This year's spring silkworm cocoon loan and purchase price of fresh cocoons in various domestic regions were previously determined by the National Cocoon Committee based on the average price in the first half of the 26th year of the Republic of China, and were separately determined according to the commodity price index in various cocoon-collecting regions. Because commodity prices have fluctuated recently, in order to protect the reasonable profits of silkworm farmers, and with reference to the actual changes in commodity prices in various places, the National Cocoon Committee agreed to revise the original verified purchase price of improved cocoons to: (1) 21 million yuan per market dan in the Jiangsu region, (2) 20 million yuan per market dan in the Zhejiang region, (3) 14 million yuan per market dan in the Sichuan region. Also, because the time for collecting cocoons is very short, the above-mentioned cocoon prices will not be changed again during the Qingming collection period after adjustment.

### External Stimulation Is Sharp: Chinese and Foreign Stocks Both Rebound

The value of imports in March was led by raw cotton, with a total value of more than 700 billion yuan. The second largest was various types of machinery, with a value of 680 billion yuan. The third largest was cotton and raw silk, with a value of 600 billion yuan.

Among exports, livestock and their products ranked first, reaching 566 billion yuan. Fabrics ranked second, with a total value of 580 billion yuan. The third largest was oils, fats, and honey, with a total value of 454 billion yuan.

Comparing the net value of our country's imports in March, American goods ranked first, with a total value exceeding 2.9 trillion yuan. India and Siam ranked second.

In terms of the country of origin of our country's exports in March, Hong Kong ranked first, importing more than 1 trillion yuan worth of our country's goods. The United States ranked second, exceeding 980 billion yuan. Japan ranked third, also exceeding 260 billion yuan, mainly for barter trade.

### A Large Amount of Tax Revenue Was Deposited into the National Treasury: The Balance of National Banks and Bureaus Increased by More Than 1 Trillion Yuan

Yesterday, the money market in this city was stable and then improved. The implied interest rate in the market remained at around 3.3%.

According to news from the Central Bank, the reason for the large increase in the reserves of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury yesterday was mainly due to the payment of a large amount of tax revenue into the national treasury, totaling more than 300 billion yuan. In addition, the sale of yarn, cloth, rice, oil, and other necessities by the China Textile Corporation and the China Trust Bureau was also a major reason for this phenomenon.

### Tianjin Basketball Team Loses Again to Renyu, Yunnan Shuizhen Women's Team Defeats Minli Again

[Report from this newspaper] The Tianjin World Games basketball preliminary team played its third friendly match last night, losing again to Renyu by a narrow margin of 53 to 57. The two sides were evenly matched and difficult to separate. In the first half, Renyu trailed by only one point, 29 to 28. Tianjin changed its style last night, adopting a steady strategy, which seemed somewhat awkward and prevented them from playing freely. Although Tianjin lost, they were able to absorb the good points. In the women's match, the Yunnan Shuizhen team continued to demonstrate its power, defeating Minli Girls' High School 48 to 41.

Shuizhen Wins Again The first game saw Yunnan Shuizhen's second appearance, facing off against Minli. Shuizhen served, and Ma Jinfu scored first. Minli's Wang Zelong replied, and Ma Jinfu struck again, scoring again. Minli's Huang Pinzhen scored on a free throw, and Qian Mengyue added another point, giving Minli a 5 to 4 lead. Zhu Zelong and Huang Pinzhen repeatedly scored, giving Minli an 11 to 5 advantage. The visiting team called a timeout, and Zheng Rong, Xu Wanxiu, and Ma Jinfu successively broke through the basket. However, Minli also gained points frequently, and Minli led 17 to 12 in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Shuizhen's Liu Chun replaced Zou Rong, and Xu Naifeng and Ma Jinfu both scored, allowing the visiting team to score eight points in one go, taking the lead 24 to 19. Minli substituted Xu Xiuyun for Huang Pinzhen, but still could not stop their momentum. At the end of the first half, Shuizhen led 30 to Minli's 24.

Resuming the match, Ma Jinfu scored first, and Qian Mengyue responded in kind. Minli's Huang Pinzhen scored three consecutive points, closing the gap to 34 to 31. Shuizhen led 42 to 35 in the third quarter. In the final quarter, Minli's Qi Lishao entered the game, replacing Xu Xiuyun, and Ze Lun switched to forward. Mengyue scored twice, and Xu Naifeng scored with both hands, making it 45 to 41, a difference of two points. Minli was about to reverse the declining trend, but time was not on their side. When Nai Feng scored three consecutive free throws, the time had already run out. In total, the visiting team overcame Minli with a score of 48 to 41, winning both games.

Tianjin Suffers Defeat In the second match, Tianjin faced Renyu. Tianjin fielded Wang Qi, Zhang Changlu, Fu Jinsheng, Li Hanting, and Tang Zhensheng, while Renyu countered with Shen Pengju, Xu Zhongyi, Sun Guozheng, Yao Wen, and Le Jiazhou. Tianjin's Wang Qi scored first, but soon Wang Qi committed a foul, and Le Jiazhou scored on both free throws, tying the score at 2. Then they scored 4, 6, 8, and 10 points each, tying at 15, with evenly matched strength and difficult to separate. At the end of the first half, Renyu led by only one point, 29 to 28.

Resuming the match, the game continued to be a seesaw battle. After 36 to 34, Renyu found their rhythm again. Shen Pengju scored, and Le Jiazhou scored twice, adding six points, and Tianjin began to fall behind. Wang Qi tried to catch up. Tianjin's Tang Zhensheng and Renyu's Le Jiazhou scored points alternately, making it 48 to 41, with the game in turmoil. When Yao Wen scored on a free throw, making it 53 to 44, a difference of nine points, Renyu's advantage became more stable. However, Tianjin was not willing to give up, scoring two consecutive points. Renyu's Sun Guozheng fouled out, and Le Jiazhou re-entered as a substitute. After that, there were no major changes in the game, and at the end of the game, Renyu won by two points, 57 to 53.

### The Song of Shanghai University

‚Äî Lu Shixiong

The most wonderful moment of the Shanghai University concert

The atmosphere of music appreciation is relatively strong in church schools. If you walk into the residences of their faculty and staff, you can often see a piano lying across the room as the main decoration, and sometimes violins and accordions are hung all over the place.

Shanghai University has always been known for its well-managed business school, so people may think that Shanghai University students all have the "Tao Zhu" style, are skilled in trade, and can calculate well. However, because they live in a quiet environment and are immersed in the embrace of church education, most of the students are familiar with orchestral music, play the piano or violin, or at least hum a few beautiful songs.

Last night, Shanghai University held a concert at the Lyceum Theatre. I am a layman when it comes to music, but I was specially invited by the school to attend. As the saying goes, "playing the lute to a cow," I was no different from a cow for two hours because I didn't understand music.

Beautiful Soprano The overall impression of the Shanghai University concert that it gave me, such as the scene, musical instruments, and the demeanor of the students, can be said to be neat, complete, beautiful, elegant, and serious, and fully demonstrates the talent and qualities of the male and female students who love music. They have artistic cultivation, but without any annoying habits, and a kind of innocence, humility, and earnest attitude, which is very suitable for the identity of students from higher institutions. All the performers were able to show their strengths, among which Cheng Zhizhen's soprano solo and Situ Huacheng's violin solo won the most thunderous applause. Cheng Zhizhen's singing voice was clear, tactful, and moving, and it sounded a bit like "Jenny McDonald." As for Situ Huacheng's violin solo, it was played with great earnestness. The sound of the strings was secluded and graceful, with proper cadence. His artistic excellence was praised not only by "foreign music devils," but even the Gypsies would be inferior. After he played twice, he still could not meet the audience's expectations, so after the applause lasted for five or six minutes, he had to play it again. In addition, Tong Lichun's piano solo also had the charm of "a song that is hard to forget." If you want to achieve deep attainments in all kinds of music, you must have musical instruments for daily practice, but the price of a piano is not cheap, and it is not easy to purchase, so good piano players are also not easy to come by.

Refined Chorus The "Shanghai University Song" chorus at the end was particularly wonderful, melting all the advantages of Shanghai University into one, and presenting them all. This is a carefully crafted masterpiece by Dr. Zhu Qidong, a music professor at the school. The fifth section of the song has "Ai Yo Ai Yo Hum" and so on, which indicates the singing of the hardworking workers in the school, which is particularly unique. This makes the famous song "Fu Jia" in the movie "Party Soul" in the past cannot be exclusively beautiful.

After the meeting, I met President Ling of the school. He was smiling and proud, because the students have such achievements, and he is also "honored."

"Playing the lute to a cow" seems to mean that those who don't understand music are not worthy to appreciate music. In fact, music can be pleasing and transformative, and no matter whether you understand it or not, it is always beneficial to listen to it. Therefore, although I don't understand music, listening to the Shanghai University concert also has the feeling of relieving worries; what's more, I recently heard that some people in the United States installed wireless music in cowsheds, and the quality of milk from those cows that listened to music was more excellent, and the amount of milk was more abundant, which shows that music is not only beneficial to people, but also beneficial to animals, which is another thought I have about music.

### Chairman and Mrs. Receive Overseas Chinese Athletes at the National Games and Encourage Them to Love Themselves, Strengthen Themselves, and Contribute Their Strength to the Motherland

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Chairman Chiang and Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek received more than 280 male and female overseas Chinese athletes who came to Beijing for the National Games at the auditorium of the Ministry of National Defense at 2 p.m. on the 19th. Minister of Overseas Affairs Chen Qingyun, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Liu Weizhi, and Secretary-General of the National Games Hao Gengsheng accompanied the athletes to pay their respects. At 2 p.m., Chairman Chiang and Mrs. Chiang arrived, and Minister Chen and Chairman Liu greeted them outside the auditorium. All the athletes stood up and applauded enthusiastically to show their respect. Chairman Chiang and Mrs. Chiang nodded to the athletes with a smile and bowed in return. Then, they stepped onto the podium and accepted the flags presented by the overseas Chinese athletes from Malaya, the Philippines, Indonesia, Siam, and Hong Kong. Immediately, they delivered a brief speech, roughly stating: The overseas Chinese athletes have performed very well in the National Games. After the athletes return overseas after the end of the Games, they should strengthen their physical fitness even more and hope to win greater glory in the future World Games and bring glory to the motherland. The motherland's love for overseas Chinese is no different from the love for domestic compatriots, so I hope that overseas Chinese can love themselves, be self-reliant, and contribute their strength to the motherland with all their efforts. Finally, I wish all the athletes good health. After Chairman Chiang finished his speech, Mrs. Chiang took the stage in the midst of enthusiastic applause from all the athletes and continued to speak, hoping that all the overseas Chinese would return overseas, whether in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaya, Siam, or anywhere else, they should pay special attention to their physical fitness and the inherent noble morals of China, and promote them. Today, I am very comforted to see that you are full of energy and healthy. Mrs. Chiang, fearing that some of the overseas Chinese athletes were not very familiar with Mandarin, repeated it in English. The athletes then shouted slogans such as Long Live the Republic of China and Long Live Chairman Chiang and Mrs. Chiang. Chairman Chiang and Mrs. Chiang nodded with a smile and said "Good," showing great pleasure, and shook hands with Gu Athletes before leaving.

### Black and White Play the Shantou Team Tonight

### The Wind and Rain are Dreary, the Music Ends, and the People Disperse A Tour of the National Games Venue The Streets of the National Games are Filled with Reed Sheds The Basketball Room is Converted into a Reception Center

[Report from this newspaper] A reporter recently went to the National Games athletes' dormitory in the Zhongxun Tuan on Shuidao Road for a tour. Shanglian Zhai was already empty, and major construction was underway to convert it into the "Shanghai Supply Bureau Joint Logistics Training Class." In Zhongzheng Hall, there were still athletes from the Northeast, Hebei, Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Rehe, and other units who had come to Shanghai on the Zhongcheng warship. Some of them were jumping and running on the basketball court, while some were playing cards on the couches. The female athletes lived together in the low house on the right side of the hall. According to Liu Changchun and Qi Peilin, who broke the national record for discus, the Zhongcheng warship is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 23rd. However, the ship is carrying too much cargo on this trip north, and it is inconvenient for the athletes to rest, so the leaders of each unit are trying to negotiate with the China Merchants Bureau for ships. If that is not possible, they can only return north on the "Zhongcheng" again. Among them, the Rehe athletes were very uneasy after reading the news about the emergency in Chengde and hoped to return as soon as possible. The Guizhou athletes are scheduled to go to Hankou from Shanghai today and then return to Changsha. The reporter then left the Zhongxun Tuan and went to inspect the sports field. The heavy rain overnight had restored the National Games field, which had been trampled on by millions of people, to its original state. The reed sheds were still there, and all the fancy facades had been completely dismantled. The wind and rain were dreary, which increased the loneliness. The Municipal Sports College in the swimming pool is scheduled to resume classes on the 20th. The school has been ordered to take care of the swimming pool and gymnasium and has sent police to guard it. However, according to the teachers of the school, some of the tiles in the swimming pool have been stolen by thieves in recent days, so the interior has been cleared and the doors have been sealed, and no idlers are allowed to enter. The basketball room, which used to have many wrestling and fighting scenes, now has a wooden sign hanging on it that says "Reception Center for Shanghai Transit Troops of the Joint Logistics Headquarters." Inside, three or four students from the Municipal Sports College were playing basketball, dribbling, and running, which caused a loud echo in the empty room. The track and field was full of stagnant water. The advertising signs were washed by the rain and became more vivid. On the scoreboard in the south of the field, there were still the words "Nanjing" vs. "Sichuan", which seemed to be a very big mockery. Several students were practicing starting on the lonely runway, which made people feel empty and melancholy. The houses in the northern part of the East Command have been converted into dormitories and classrooms for the Sports College, but some are empty, with only walls full of "hot dog" and soda slogans that have not been removed. On the wall of an empty house, there were several lines of large characters saying: "Come for advertising, leave at a loss, see you at the 8th National Games!" On the other side, it was written: "The joy of the closing of the National Games." The horizontal words were "A grand opening but a weak ending," signed by Shi Jun, which made people laugh dumbfounded. (Written by Wen Yu)

### "Life and Aesthetics"

‚Äî Wen Zhaotong

(Written by Chernyshevsky, Translated by Zhou Yang)

(Published by Hong Kong Ocean Bookstore)

Since the publication of Cai Yi's "New Aesthetics," it can be said that some progress and development have been made in the study of aesthetics in China. Because in "New Aesthetics," we can see a solemn criticism of the old, traditional aesthetics, discovering its mistakes; on the other hand, a new aesthetic system is established. Although "Life and Aesthetics" is not completely consistent with "New Aesthetics" in theory, it is certainly not in the category of the old aesthetics that are games of ideas.

"Life Aesthetics" mainly tells us: "Beauty is life," not "Beauty is the complete matching and consistency of concepts and images."

Because "beauty is an individual, living object, not an abstract idea," therefore "anything in which we see life, as we understand and hope, as we like, is beauty."

Chernyshevsky also pointed out that beauty comes from life, and that the concept of beauty depends on the economic conditions of human life, such as: "Making young farmers and farm girls have the complexion of fresh roses‚Äîthis is the first standard of beauty in the eyes of simple people. ‚Ä¶ Noble beauties are different; their ancestors have all lived without manual labor; due to the idle life, the blood rarely circulates, the muscles of the limbs are weaker and weaker from generation to generation, and the bones are more and more brittle, and the inevitable result is slender limbs. This is the only life worth living that the upper class feels." ‚Äî Is a beauty worth praising.

Starting from such a point of view, he determined art as: "Art does not express ideas abstractly but with living, individual facts," "Because there is nothing abstract in life and nature. There everything is concrete. Reproduction should convey the essence of the reproduced thing as closely as possible. Therefore, artistic creation should be the least abstract and express itself concretely in vivid outlines and individual images." He valued the role of art in explaining life higher than science because of the image.

He also accurately said: "Art is the reproduction of life and nature." This is determined from the question of "image," but it is not the same as the pseudo-classical "imitation of nature" in the 17th and 18th centuries, because art emphasizes the essential characteristics of things, which must delete many useless details to achieve concise and clear characteristics.

Chernyshevsky, in this book, under his aesthetic point of view, combines art and life, "respects the reality of life, and does not believe in any a priori assumptions." and denied that works of art are "things produced by everyone's desire for beauty." This is his theoretical attitude and his method, which is also his conclusion in the author's preface": "Only those special ideas that are particularly related to aesthetics are his own. In this booklet, all broader ideas belong to Feuerbach."

### Math Train

‚Äî Qing

Wang Juncen

Kaiming Youth Series

This is a popular reading that talks about "Calculus."

"Calculus is a branch of the so-called advanced mathematics, but its application is extremely large. Because of it, mathematics is a powerful tool for people who study science." Therefore, some people think that if you haven't read calculus, you can't talk about entering the hall of mathematics! Now, the average middle school student spends so much time and energy reading math books and doing difficult problems, but they know nothing about calculus, which is an important subject, which is really unreasonable. Although there are many kinds of books on calculus published in bookstores, the traditional works are not easy for ordinary middle school students to understand. This book is intended to meet this need, introducing the basic concepts of calculus in a very shallow, clear, correct, and thorough way. Let a middle school student can easily obtain the important concepts and methods of this subject. This is indeed a very meaningful thing!

The whole book narrates the progress of a train, divided into sixteen stations, introducing the basic concepts of "change," "relative change," "limit," "infinitesimal," "rate of change," "differential method," "integral method"... with popular descriptions, so that readers can understand it at a glance. It is not like ordinary math books full of symbols and formulas, making people's heads hurt. Nor is it a blank face reciting "theorems" and "definitions," which makes people bored. There are no piles and piles of exercises that require you to answer and calculate them one by one, scaring you away. This is a story full of interest that you can read in one breath.

The author wrote an appendix at the end of the book, summarizing the entire book, and re-narrating and organizing it according to the original sections, titled "Car Inspection," so that readers can get a correct outline of what was said before, and avoid misunderstandings. This is very necessary.

I think there is a flaw in the printing of this book. Probably for the sake of the uniformity of the series version, it is all vertically arranged, which is very unsuitable for math books. I believe that readers may therefore add a lot of trouble, or reduce their interest in reading. I wonder if the publisher of the book has also noticed this? If it can be changed to horizontal arrangement, it will definitely increase the value of this book a lot.

### A Brief History of the World War

‚Äî By Tian Chunyin

A Miniature History of the War

By R.C.K Ensor

Oxford University Press

This war can truly be called a world war. Starting with Japan's invasion of the Northeast, its brewing and expansion continued until its end‚Äîeven now, a peace treaty has not been signed, and on the surface, it cannot be called over. It has lasted no less than fifteen years, and its complex and intricate content is unprecedented. Therefore, just considering the war itself in a narrow sense, the writing of this war history alone presents a myriad of possibilities, making it difficult to cover everything. If we expand and elaborate further, discussing other aspects of politics, economics, and society, as well as the origins and details, it requires both bold strokes and meticulous detail. For an individual or a small group to write it hastily would be a reckless adventure, resulting in a sense of neglecting some aspects and being incomplete and inaccurate. Moreover, with the progress of modern historiography‚Äîespecially the attention and collection of historical materials in both depth and breadth‚Äîcoupled with the fact that from the very beginning of this war, countries like Britain and the United States intentionally preserved and recorded information, and all of this was overseen by military personnel, the storage of historical materials is truly vast. In terms of the normal steps of historical writing, one must first gather and record information, then test and organize it, and only then can one begin writing and compile it into a credible history. Furthermore, given the urgency of the times, the proximity of events, the absence of a peace treaty, and the fact that aftershocks are still emerging, relevant historical materials cannot be released. Therefore, talking about completing a book at this time is simply too early and hasty.

Taking the history of the First World War as an example, the Englishman F.W. Pick pointed out three issues: First, the vast amount of historical materials is overwhelming, making it impossible to extract oneself. For example, Germany published its foreign ministry archives in 52 volumes as Grosse Politik (1870-1914); France, by 1932, had not finished compiling and had already published 19 volumes of Documents Diplomatiques Francais (1898-1914); and the United States published 14 volumes of Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States. Second, what seems complete in fact has many omissions. Third, publishers prioritize national interests, and historians and published works are thus enslaved and used as tools of the nation, making it impossible for people to fully believe. He emphasized the importance of both method and author, believing that the former should combine the strengths of chronicles and annals and integrate them into one, especially requiring the use of cross-referencing and the addition of reliable indexes. As for the latter, he believed that the author must be an independent and unbiased historical expert, free from the intrusion of political forces. He further emphasized that what we need today is not another flood of historical books, but a guiding committee to help crystallize meaningful historical events and express them in the form of towering rocks. Based on this, we have recently seen Ensor's A Miniature History of the War published by Oxford University Press, and C. Grove Haines and Ross J.SHoffman's Origins and Background of the Second War‚Äî(These two books are unrelated to Pick's remarks, at most coinciding with them unintentionally.) This article describes the content of the former book.

The content of A Miniature History of the War is limited to the military aspects of Europe, so it ends on May 7, 1945, when all remaining German forces surrendered. The first edition was published in November 1944, and the second and third editions were expanded to include the end of the European war in 1945. The entire book is only a hundred pages long, with four pages of major events, and four maps of the Western European front, the Mediterranean, the Russian front, and the Pacific. After reading it, one can truly say that it is concise, accurate, and most convenient for the general reader. The first chapter is an introduction, stating that the war reached its peak in November 1942. In this month, the victories of El Alamein and Stalingrad marked the turning point for the Allied forces, gradually leading them to success and eventual victory. The second chapter discusses how the Germans made advantageous preparations for war. The third chapter discusses how the Germans expanded their borders. The fourth chapter discusses how the war spread globally. The fifth chapter discusses how the Allied forces (New York Times Book Review Weekly) began to fight freely, starting in mid-summer of 1943. The sixth chapter covers the last two years. The seventh chapter discusses the victory of the three parties. The eighth chapter discusses the invasion of Germany. In the ninth chapter, the author, focusing on war, shows some bias and imbalance in other aspects. Therefore, in this chapter, five points are reiterated: First, other allied nations besides the three great powers made genuine contributions to the entire war: Norway and Greece provided transport ships, Belgium provided the resources of the Congo, and the Netherlands initially provided the resources of the East Indies. Although they were used very little on the battlefield, there were still excellent examples, such as the Free French at Bir Hakeim, the Dutch East Indies Navy in the South Pacific, the amazing fighting spirit of exiled Poles, the heroic actions of the residents of Malta, and the brilliant achievements of the Indian 4th Division. Second, China took the lead in resisting Japan, which was extremely remarkable in terms of the world war before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Their martyred soldiers and civilians effectively determined their future and the world, which no one can deny. Third, this war was not only against aggression but also against barbarism. Fourth, the superiority of mechanical power in the war. Fifth, the power of the spirit, the aggressors who accumulated evil will inevitably fail to last.

Currently, our countrymen have produced translations and writings on this war, but in terms of time and materials, especially method and authorship, there is much to be discussed. The creation of this book is still a good popular work of the time, which is briefly introduced here. As for its detailed discussion, it cannot be fully covered in this article.

### Music for Children

‚Äî By Wu Huaichen

Translated by Feng Zikai, Published by Kaiming Bookstore

I hope that every national teacher has some artistic cultivation. Whether you teach arithmetic, English, or history and geography, national education is essentially an education of influence, using emotion more than reason. When dealing with a pure and mischievous child, sincere guidance is often more effective than rational coercion. This is undoubtedly true.

In the past, Mr. Cai Yuanpei also advocated "aesthetic education." "Aestheticization" is essentially an exercise of emotion, and the expression of emotion, coupled with artistic cultivation, will inevitably be more measured. Art is also a concrete expression of "aestheticization."

If you, the teachers of national education, want to ask me about books on artistic cultivation, I have an excellent book to recommend to you: that is "Music for Children," which I have read three times. This book is translated by Mr. Feng Zikai, originally written by Japanese author Hisao Tanabe, and includes ten chapters and a preface. As soon as you read the preface, it will clearly give you an inspiration to know its intrinsic value. I will not praise it; I hope you will read it carefully, use your wisdom to comprehend it, and use any methods you have gained from your past experience to implement it. This is a little expectation I have after introducing this book.

### The Water Carrier Girl

‚Äî By Yu Ying

Written by Balzac, Translated by Gao Mingkai, Published by Haiyan Bookstore

In Balzac's short fifty-one-year life, most of his time was spent writing the monumental work "La Com√©die humaine." On August 18, 1850, he passed away. At his burial, the French Minister of the Interior suddenly asked Mr. Hugo, "Is he a great genius?" Hugo replied, "It is fair to say he is a great genius." - In France at that time, people's view of Balzac, a man of his generation, was so indifferent. After Balzac's death, many critics of his artistic theories emerged, but I believe the most accurate criticism is what a certain European philosopher said:

Balzac is a great realist artist. In his great work "La Com√©die humaine," he gave us the best realist history of French society. In the form of recording customs, the author, year by year, from 1816 to 1848, wrote about the gradual pressure of the gaining bourgeoisie on aristocratic society. He wrote about how this society was destroyed under the pressure of vulgar nouveau riche, and he described how the affairs of these great figures were only a way to support themselves. Around this central issue, he arranged the entire history of French society, and we learned more economic details. Here, there is even more information than the combined works of all professional historians, statisticians, and economists of this period." (See "Scientific Literary Theory")

"La Com√©die humaine," in terms of its social significance, is no different from a history of France in the early 19th century.

Not long ago, I continuously read several of Balzac's novels. In terms of writing technique, I prefer "Le P√®re Goriot"; in terms of the exquisite character portrayal, I prefer "Eug√©nie Grandet"; but in terms of the excellent structure and layout, I prefer "The Water Carrier Girl" (also known as "A Bachelor's Establishment").

"What Napoleon could not complete with the sword, I will complete with the pen." This is Balzac's bold statement. Anyone who has slightly read "La Com√©die humaine" will not taste his bold words with a mocking tone! Balzac worked diligently for more than thirty years, and he finally established his small kingdom in the world of literature. Just looking at his "Trilogy of Bachelors" or "Trilogy of Illusions," we can know how broad his writing scope is, how rich his life experience is, how vivid his vocabulary is, and how deep his observation is.

"The Water Carrier Girl" depicts the frequent inheritance disputes in the French upper class during the Restoration period. Obviously, the characters he wrote are typical characters, and the events are also typical events.

The first half of the story centers on Agathe, the daughter of Dr. Rouget, describing how she struggled to survive under the torment of the wastrel Philippe, and finally ended up with no way out, so she had to return to her hometown of Issoudun with her second son Joseph to seek refuge with her brother Jean-Jacques Rouget, but was miserably persecuted by the conspiracies of Maxence (rumored to be Dr. Rouget's illegitimate son) and the water carrier girl Flore, and was driven back to Paris. Balzac writes about Agathe's loyalty, purity, and sincerity, a woman full of maternal love who has lived a wandering life, vividly. The second half centers on the duel between the wastrel Philippe and the rogue Maxence, revolving around a detailed description of French provincial life, a psychological portrayal of the guards during the Restoration period, and how Philippe squeezed into the aristocratic class after his victory. But at the same time, the purpose of this duel was only to compete for Dr. Rouget's inheritance worth about one million six hundred thousand francs, so Philippe's various struggles and fights to obtain this inheritance can be said to be the focus of the second half of the book.

The whole book has two climaxes. The climax of the second half is the "duel," which has already been mentioned above; the climax of the first half is the death of Philippe's aunt, Madame des Grassins. Madame des Grassins had no hobbies in her life, she just loved to buy lottery tickets. She and Agathe depended on each other and lived together, so when Philippe became a burden to his mother Agathe, his aunt Madame des Grassins also suffered the same burden. Their family finally became poorer and poorer, and they had to return part of the house, sell furniture, mortgage interest, and compress their lives, living helplessly. But Philippe was still drinking wildly and gambling heavily, often bringing them unpredictable disasters.

In order to describe Philippe's rogue appearance, Balzac used a grand style. Especially in order to highlight the tragic death of his aunt, Madame des Grassins (which can be used to reflect Philippe's ruthlessness), Balzac arranged a lot of space, closely pressing on the central theme of "lottery draw," and achieved a very profound tragic effect.

In terms of characters, Agathe, Philippe, Joseph, Madame des Grassins, Maxence, the water carrier girl Flore, and the bachelor‚ÄîDr. Rouget's only son, Jean-Jacques Rouget‚Ä¶ each has its own prominent personality and its own social environment. Although the scene of the whole book is large, the clues are extremely clear. However, the ending describes Philippe's tragic death in Algiers, which inevitably makes people feel overly hasty after reading it.

### Tea Brewing and Culture

‚Äî By Bai

Nowadays, brewing tea in a pot is no longer popular. Even at home, it's like traveling‚Äîa glass of water is poured over it and it's done. Long ago, selling brewed tea was not common. Usually it was boiled tea and whisked tea, that is, cooking tea. The ancient method of Lu Yu definitely couldn't be done with just pouring hot water; even when boiling, one had to pay attention to the heat and bubbles like "crab eyes." Later generations simplified everything, which might be one aspect of it? (In Hunan and Jiangxi, there may still be remnants of boiled tea and whisked tea.) At a friend's place, I saw children's clothes from the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods of the Qing Dynasty. The patterns, embroidery, and workmanship were so intricate and dense that they were almost incomparable to today's materials and workmanship. The same was especially true for adult clothes. From this, I thought about the differences between ancient thought and culture and today's. These minor details can also give a glimpse into the differences. The ancients were serious and meticulous, not sloppy in the slightest, which was their strength, but their complexity and lack of focus on essentials, lack of efficiency, and disregard for utilitarianism were their shortcomings. Today, it is the opposite. Whether the gains and losses can be balanced is something one cannot help but feel emotional about.

Thinking carefully about the matter of culture, as Liang Rengong said, it is like a teapot that has been brewing tea for a long time. There must be tea juice inside. After being soaked for a long time, even without tea leaves, pouring water into it will have its own flavor. The reason why Yixing purple clay is valuable is precisely because it retains more tea juice, that is, tea essence, and can maintain the original flavor. This statement makes a lot of sense. If so, isn't culture about "enduring years" and "accumulating qualifications"? China has more than three thousand years of history, so it has culture. Regardless of the influence of this culture, in terms of culture itself, it has undoubtedly experienced many years, taken the essence, and used it widely. For example, a centenarian, even if he was once a member of the Boxers or the White Lotus Sect and did extremely stubborn things, but today, speaking from personal experience, is still a good historical source and life experience. We can also view culture in this way. The English look down on Americans because they think their culture is too shallow. This statement is not without some truth. The United States was founded less than two hundred years ago. If China is a centenarian, the United States is just a playful child of six or seven years old. Their jumping and frolicking are naturally different from those who are old and dragging their canes. But when it comes to life experience or abstract thought, it is far inferior to the centenarian who can talk about ancient events, making listeners weep and sigh.

Therefore, at the end of the First World War, many people admired Eastern spiritual civilization, believing that the sins created by material civilization were too great. Liang Rengong's "European Travel Heart Shadow Record" can be taken as a representative. At that time, many scientists, such as Mr. Ding Wenjiang, believed that the publication of such articles had a negative impact on China, which was lagging behind in science, but Liang still published them regardless of everything. However, it never really caused China to regress, because the convenience that material civilization gives people is sensory, stimulating, and realistic. Once you have it, you can never leave it. You can only find a way to use it well, what is called adapting to the situation, and you cannot refuse to eat because of choking. At the turn of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, the theories of Lao-Zhuang, although they criticized Confucius and Mencius thoroughly, ultimately failed to overthrow the existing order, that is, the material civilization of that time. This is inevitable. However, what we want to say is not a dogmatic rejection of material things, but a desire not to abandon the spirit within material things.

To be honest, material things are "civilization," and spiritual things can be called "culture." Civilization can be created, discovered, or invented, but culture cannot be created, as mentioned earlier, it requires accumulating qualifications! A teapot cannot have tea juice all at once; it must endure the years. The auspicious bronze and jade from the Zhou and Han dynasties were not necessarily considered valuable at the time, but after two or three thousand years, they were excavated from the ground and became priceless. Why? "Culture!" This is nothing but "culture"! Counterfeits of antiques can use chemical agents to make copper tripods and copper cauldrons grow red and green rust, but they cannot fool the eyes of experts! Therefore, those who imitate elegance are like fake antiques. During the Ming Dynasty, Li Mengyang and others imitated Tang poetry, but ultimately could not become Tang poetry. This is an example of fake antiques. People at the end of the Qing Dynasty wanted to write Jiangxi poetry or Xikun style, but it was still a fake! Then, why should we abandon our real things? We not only should not abandon them, but we probably cannot abandon them.

Civilization requires the use of the brain, and culture also requires it. The essence seems to be no different, but the radio and gramophone only satisfy your curiosity or give your senses temporary satisfaction. You cannot stare at a Philco or RCA for a day, appreciating its beauty. However, a painting by the Four Wangs and Wu Yun, a work by Bada Shanren, or an official kiln, a famous porcelain from the Ru kiln, is enough for you to stare at it every day. If it is a beautiful poem, a vivid article, it can even more make you dream of it; and especially a profound thought, a principle, will always give you understanding and inspiration. This is true "culture." I feel that today's China not only relies on "US aid" for "civilization," but it also seems to have already imitated others in culture. If we are all comrades who cannot use both hands and brains, then let us use a little more brain and think a little more, okay? At least it won't be below listening to advertisements or even Peking opera broadcast on the radio, right?‚Äî‚ÄîAlthough Peking opera can also be regarded as one of the bits and pieces of culture.

### Spring Outing Notes, Part Two

‚Äî By Sanmu

Stone Pavilion Mountain

I am tired of listening to the sounds of drums and music, a short spring outing appreciates the soft sedan chair, dangerous stones form stairs to the sky with faint paths, wild flowers surround the visitor desiring to bewilder the ford, the ancient Silence Light Cave has clouds carved into its walls, the Bright Moon Slope is flat and the grass obstructs people, only the lake waves know prosperity and decline, the tide always gathers towards the shore.

On the Road to Bao Mountain

The spring water ripples with long white duckweed, cooking smoke dimly visible separated by fine dust, forest flowers face the sun, plum blossoms compete to cover, wood carrier follows the creek, calf avoids people; knife forging mountain home's craftsmanship is alive, coffin surrounds monk's abode but poverty remains, old age meets beautiful scenery adding melancholy, can't bear to see the new green grass in the fields.

Xianqing Temple

Heard that the Xianqing Temple of the previous dynasty, in prosperous times it welcomed imperial envoys, today the desolate courtyard has long spring grass, the Dharma hall is silent and the embroidered curtain hangs askew.

### Famous People's Backgrounds

Thomas Edison - the world's king of invention, once worked as a newsboy.

Giuseppe Garibaldi - the Italian revolutionary, was the son of a fisherman.

George Stephenson - the inventor of the train, was a shepherd boy when he was young.

Robert Fulton - the inventor of the steamboat, was originally an apprentice in a jewelry store.

Joseph Stalin - the son of a shoemaker.

Aesop - the world's greatest fable writer was a crippled slave.

### Rationalization

‚Äî By Shi Yu

Everyone defends their own actions. A child bumps into a table corner and feels that it is the table corner's fault, so he hits the table corner hard to show a slight punishment; an athlete loses a race and comes in last, looking at the shoes that run too slowly, his anger rises and he throws the shoes away forcefully. Writers collectively defend themselves: saying that the reason why there are no great works produced in modern China is entirely due to the lack of a mood to write great works. The decline of our country's reputation in the international community, according to Party A, is entirely due to Party B's hide-and-seek; according to Party B, it is entirely due to Party A's pedantry. Doing something right, the glory belongs to oneself. Doing something wrong, the blame belongs to others. Rationalizing is easier than self-blame, and this is probably a fact that no one dares to deny!

Humanity's explanation of nature is a kind of rationalization. In the eyes of humanity, nature is inherently ignorant: the sun rises in the east, the moon sets in the west, the height of the mountains, the depth of the sea, the white snow, the green grass, all are a series of mysteries. The oldest philosophers then rationalized and explained these mysteries eloquently. Egyptian scholars explained the earth as a slightly convex plane, supported in the sky like a dome. Greek scholars explained that the moon and the sun were three spheres of about the same size, all revolving around the earth. We deny that Plato and Socrates were scientists, because they "rationalized" too much and observed too little. A ten-year-old child is exploring the true meaning of life:

"Where does the chicken come from?"

"From the egg!"

"Where does the egg come from?"

"From the chicken!"

The child is satisfied because he has fully found a reason to rationalize. Pavlov said that human knowledge comes from asking "Who is this?" "What is that?" But when we find an answer that satisfies us, that is also when our knowledge runs aground. Smart people are the easiest to find a satisfactory answer. A poet loses love and can write a long poem, deeply feeling that this is God's arrangement; Xiang Yu is trapped in Gaixia and cannot help but exclaim: "Heaven is destroying me, it is not a crime of war!" A middle school student is saying "I can get knowledge in college!" A college student is saying: "College is a place to learn to live together! Doing scholarship is a matter after graduation!" Here, changing "gold everywhere" to "reasons everywhere" would be more appropriate. Byron said: "You can see Helen in every woman." George Bernard Shaw said: "You can find truth in every book." Therefore, if we want to rationalize, we can find reasons in every corner of our memory, and still be excellent and moving.

"Rationalizing" is mostly subconscious. Conscious rationalization is already a means. A child wants to eat "salad," so he creates various reasons to explain to his parents the importance of "salad" to the human body. A hypocritical person is telling everyone annoyingly: "I think everyone in the world is a good person!" to show that he is also a "good person." In order to establish the lofty ideals of Confucianism, Confucius forgot the principle of gradual evolution of society and described the most ancient society as perfect. Greek philosophers also described the original gentleman as a celestial being and the original society as a paradise.

From a psychological point of view, the "rationalizing" mentality is an abnormal mentality. Because it is escaping reality. Rationalization can give you temporary satisfaction and happiness, but it keeps you away from facts and truth.

One year before the founding of the Republic of China (the third year of the Xuantong reign, Xinhai year, 1911 AD), the President was twenty-five years old. The Wuchang Uprising occurred. The President returned to China in disguise and arrived in Shanghai. Chen Qimei ordered him to take charge of Zhejiang affairs and appointed him commander of the Zhejiang vanguard. The President then led a dare-to-die squad to bomb the Zhejiang governor's office, capturing Governor Zeng Yun. Another army attacked the general's office, and the Banner garrison also surrendered.

### Speaking About Writing Articles

‚Äî Yi Jun

This publication has previously published several articles about writing, some discussing writer's block, some discussing squeezing [ideas out], and some discussing writing habits. Their discussions have made me want to talk about it as well. This is what is called "throwing a brick to attract jade."

I am not a writer, and my method of writing articles is certainly not particularly clever, but I am still a "writer," so my method of writing articles is not necessarily "insignificant."

Enough small talk. I have a brain, so I can think; I am not a mute, so I can speak. Thought becomes language, language becomes words, and language that becomes words is an article. So before I write an article, I first think about how to speak, and then I write down what I say. Because one always speaks, and there is always something to say, otherwise one would be a mute. For example, if someone asks me, "What are your plans after graduation?" I will either state my plans truthfully, or speak vaguely, or speak off the cuff. No matter what, if I express what I say in words, it becomes an article. For example, if someone hits me for no reason, I get angry and curse him, or even file a complaint against him with the authorities. Afterwards, if I write down what I cursed or what I complained about, it becomes an article. So I think the way to write an article is simply to write down what you want to say or what you have already said.

I have a younger brother who is not very good at studying. Asking him to write an essay is like squeezing oil from a stone. One morning, he said to me, "I had two dreams last night." I said, "What dreams? Tell me about them." So he told me the whole story, in detail, and it was quite interesting. After he finished, I said to him, "Write down the dreams you just told me about, and ask me about any words you don't know how to write." As if he had received inspiration, he quickly finished writing it, and it was surprisingly good and well-structured. Writing down what you say is another example.

After writing down what you say, of course, it's not a case of "once a word is out, four horses cannot chase it back." The second step is to slowly revise it, delete what should not be said, and add what was left out. For example, if you want to change the sentence "I am very happy" to "I am very pleased," you can. You can also change it to "I am overjoyed," or "My mind is clear and my spirits are high, forgetting both favor and disgrace," or "It stirred the musical strings of my heart." Or else, you can simply delete the four words "I am very happy," or you can add the sentence "I am simply ecstatic" in addition to keeping the four words.

That's how I write articles. If you think it's insignificant, I might as well say it's not insignificant.

### Hospital Village

‚Äî Mao Yi

The "Public Convalescent Home" in the British industrial city of Leeds is planning to move to the countryside and become a new type of organization: a "Hospital Village."

The center of the Hospital Village is a new hospital with 500 beds. It can also accommodate 350 patients who need treatment but do not need to be bedridden, who can stay in the Hospital Village's hotel.

The advantage of this new type of Hospital Village over ordinary hospitals and home convalescence is that it provides ample opportunities for work and recreation.

Work in a park-like environment will allow patients to gradually recover their health while operating lathes, saws, or looms‚Äîconvalescence is not about lying still, activity is essential. For patients with amputated legs or arms, clever experts will teach them how to use their remaining limbs.

Part of the Hospital Village is reserved for frail children, who are educated in hospital wards, and if they are able to get up, they go to the village school. This school specializes in accommodating children with psychological or physical illnesses who cannot enter ordinary schools. There are also plans to accommodate 200 visually impaired children, who study separately in one part of the school, but play with the other children.

The Hospital Village will have a theater, showing movies, or where patients themselves can perform plays and give concerts. As for those patients who prefer outdoor life, they can happily stroll and relax in the flower-filled environment.

The main purpose of the planners of the Hospital Village is to eliminate the aversion to long-term hospitalization. Patients in ordinary hospitals feel isolated from normal life, and this feeling of "isolation from the world" is a significant obstacle to recovery. Once moved to the Hospital Village, patients feel as if they are taking a vacation in a village with a normal daily life background, and a pleasant mood can certainly have the effect of curing diseases, increasing confidence and speed of recovery.

### Bearing Obligations, Bearing Responsibilities

For a person to be president, it is by no means to enjoy rights or to enjoy fame, but to bear obligations and to bear responsibilities. Rights can be declined, fame can be avoided, but the responsibility of revolution must not be shirked, and the obligation of revolution cannot be abandoned. (Respectfully recorded from Chiang Kai-shek's speech on the presidential issue on March 22, 1931)

### The President, Vice President, and Five Yuan After the Implementation of the Constitution

The National Assembly has concluded successfully, and the President and Vice President have been elected successively and formally inaugurated today. From now on, China will truly enter the stage of constitutional governance. How the government after the implementation of the Constitution will be organized, what the powers of the President and Vice President are, how the presidents of the Five Yuan are produced, and what their interrelationships are, are all issues that we are most concerned about today, and that every citizen of a constitutional country must clearly understand. Here, we will provide a general explanation of the above issues in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.

The President is the head of state and represents the state externally. The President's powers include promulgating laws and issuing orders in accordance with the law (which must be countersigned by the President of the Executive Yuan or the President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of relevant ministries), exercising the power to conclude treaties, declare war, and make peace in accordance with the Constitution, and exercising amnesty, special pardon, commutation of sentences, and restoration of rights, etc.

Regarding the President's power of emergency measures, there was a heated discussion at this National Assembly. Article 43 of the Constitution originally stipulated: "When the state encounters natural disasters, epidemics, or major changes in the state's finances and economy that require rapid disposition, the President may, during the recess of the Legislative Yuan, issue emergency orders in accordance with the Emergency Order Law upon the resolution of the Executive Yuan Council, and take necessary measures, but must submit them to the Legislative Yuan for ratification within one month after the issuance of the orders. If the Legislative Yuan does not agree, the emergency order shall immediately become invalid." Although this clause includes hypothetical situations such as natural disasters, epidemics, and major changes in finances and economy, it does not mention mobilization for suppressing rebellion, which may cause difficulties in implementation. Therefore, during this National Assembly, more than 1,000 representatives, including Mo Dehui, proposed the formulation of a "Temporary Clause for the Period of Mobilization for Suppressing Rebellion." This proposal has been passed by the Assembly. According to this temporary clause, during the period of mobilization for suppressing rebellion, the President may, in order to avoid urgent crises for the state or the people, or to cope with major changes in finances and economy, take emergency measures upon the resolution of the Executive Yuan Council, without being restricted by the procedures stipulated in Article 39 or Article 43 of the Constitution. The Legislative Yuan may, in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Constitution, change or repeal the aforementioned emergency measures. The end of the period of mobilization for suppressing rebellion shall be announced by the President, or declared by the President upon the request of the Legislative Yuan.

This is an important resolution of this National Assembly, which enables the government to simultaneously implement the Constitution and suppress rebellion. Moreover, since this is a temporary clause, it will be cancelled after the period of validity expires, so it can be said to be a supplement to the Constitution, and not a modification of the Constitution itself. The President's term of office is six years, and may be re-elected for one consecutive term.

The election of the Vice President was also a very important program at this National Assembly. The Vice President's term of office is also six years, and may be re-elected for one consecutive term. When the President is unable to perform his duties due to circumstances, the Vice President shall act on behalf of the President until the President's term of office expires. When both the President and the Vice President are unable to perform their duties due to circumstances, the President of the Executive Yuan shall act on behalf of the President.

Next, speaking of the Executive Yuan, the Executive Yuan is the highest administrative organ of the state, and its position is of course very important. The President of the Executive Yuan is nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Legislative Yuan. As for the Vice President of the Executive Yuan, the heads of various ministries, and the ministers without portfolio, they are nominated by the President of the Executive Yuan and appointed by the President. The Executive Yuan shall submit its administrative policy and administrative report to the Legislative Yuan. If the Legislative Yuan does not agree with the important policies of the Executive Yuan, it may resolve to request the Executive Yuan to change them. If the Executive Yuan refuses to change them, it may, with the approval of the President, transfer the matter to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. During reconsideration, if two-thirds of the legislators present maintain the original resolution, then the President of the Executive Yuan must accept it. If he refuses to accept it, he will have to resign.

If the Executive Yuan believes that the laws passed by the Legislative Yuan, such as budget proposals and treaty proposals, etc., are impossible to implement, it may, with the approval of the President, transfer the matter to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration within ten days of the resolution being delivered to the Executive Yuan. During reconsideration, if two-thirds of the legislators present maintain the original proposal, then the President of the Executive Yuan must accept it and act accordingly, otherwise he will have to resign.

From this, it can be seen that the Legislative Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution has great power. The Legislative Yuan is the highest legislative organ of the state, and is organized by legislators elected by the people. Legislators have a term of three years and may be re-elected for consecutive terms. Legislators may not hold concurrent government office.

The President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan are elected by the legislators. The Legislative Yuan meets twice a year, the first time from February to the end of May, and the second time from September to the end of December. However, a special session may be convened upon the request of the President or the request of more than one-fourth of the legislators. The powers of the Legislative Yuan are to deliberate on legal proposals, budget proposals, martial law proposals, amnesty proposals, declarations of war, peace treaties, treaty proposals, and other important national matters.

Furthermore, speaking of the Judicial Yuan, the Judicial Yuan manages the adjudication of civil, criminal, and administrative lawsuits, and the discipline of civil servants. The Judicial Yuan interprets the Constitution and has the power to unify the interpretation of laws and orders.

The President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan are nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Control Yuan. The Judicial Yuan also has a number of Grand Justices, who are also nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Control Yuan.

The Examination Yuan manages matters such as examinations, appointments, merit ratings, performance evaluations, commendations, and pensions. The President, Vice President, and members of the Examination Yuan are nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Control Yuan.

The Control Yuan is the highest control organ of the state. Control Yuan members are elected by the provincial and municipal councils, the Mongolian and Tibetan local councils, and overseas Chinese organizations. The President and Vice President of the Control Yuan are elected by the Control Yuan members. The term of office for Control Yuan members is six years and they may be re-elected for consecutive terms.

The Control Yuan may impeach the President and Vice President, but it must be proposed by more than one-fourth of all Control Yuan members, reviewed and resolved by more than half of all Control Yuan members, and then submitted to the National Assembly for discussion on whether to remove them from office. The National Assembly originally met only ninety days before the end of each presidential term, but if the Control Yuan formally submits an impeachment case against the President and Vice President, it will immediately convene a special session.

### The Life and Style of Li Zongren

Vice President Li Zongren, courtesy name Delin, is a native of Lingui County, Guangxi. He has dedicated himself to the revolution for more than 30 years, his meritorious service is brilliant, and his name is famous throughout the world. His election as Vice President is worthy of celebration for our country's future.

Li was born in 1891. His family was well-off, but his father was charitable and generous, and he liked to make friends, but did not engage in production. Therefore, when Li was young, he was already poor. However, Li was open-minded and did not bother with the learning of chapters and sentences in his studies, but only focused on the great meaning of the classics and the causes and consequences of the rise and fall of dynasties.

Before he reached the age of coronation, Li joined the Tongmenghui secretly when he entered the Guangxi Army Primary School. At the time of graduation, it coincided with the Xinhai Revolution. In the first year of the Republic of China, he entered the Guangxi Army Rapid Training School. After graduation, he served as a platoon and company commander. He was seriously injured twice in the National Protection and Law Protection battles, and accumulated merits to the rank of lieutenant colonel. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, Guangxi was in great chaos. In less than two years, Li gradually quelled the prefectures and counties of Guilin, Wuzhou, Yongzhou, and Longzhou. At that time, Huang Shaohong, Bai Chongxi, and Huang Xuchu were all under his command. Grand Marshal Sun then appointed Li as the Superintendent of Pacification of Guangxi. In the spring of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, Tang Jiyao of Yunnan took advantage of the change of the new funeral of the Father of the Nation, and secretly colluded with Yang Minxi, Liu Zhenhuan, and Shen Hongying's troops as internal support, claiming to be the Deputy Marshal, leading a large army, dividing the road from Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi into Guangdong, wanting to seize the two Guangdong territories, so he first sent an envoy, Wen, to Yongzhou to fabricate with Li, to induce Li to obey with sweet words and heavy coins, and to threaten Li with military power, saying that Li must comply. At that time, Li's force was only more than 10,000, and the place was newly settled, and there was no foreign aid, so the people were shocked and at a loss. Li was calm and composed, and without consulting Huang, Bai, and others, he resolutely and strictly refused, and imprisoned the envoys. So he urgently summoned Huang, Bai, and others to decide to eliminate the internal enemies first, and in less than a month, he defeated Shen Hongying's army, and then returned to the army to create a great defeat for the Yunnan Tang army's three routes into Guangxi, Guangxi was unified. Soon after, he ordered generals to send troops to Qinzhou, Lianzhou, Gaozhou, Leizhou, and the four counties of Guangdong, to assist the base camp in unifying Guangdong, and the foundation of the revolution was laid.

Before the Northern Expedition: Great Plans

In the autumn of the fourteenth year, Zhao Hengti, the governor of Hunan Province, was deeply afraid that the Xiang army in Guangdong would return to Hunan, which would be detrimental to him, so he sent Ye Qi as a representative to enter Guangxi, wanting to form an alliance with Li and jointly advocate the autonomy of the provinces, or even if not, he would ask to maintain neutrality when the Xiang army in Guangdong returned to Hunan. At this time, Li's inner advocacy of the Northern Expedition was very urgent. Dong Wu Peifu directly declared that after the failure of the Zhili-Fengtian War, he made a comeback, stationed in Wuhan, reorganized his troops, and the military's heart was not solid, and it was easy to break through. Moreover, the National Government should take advantage of the victory of unifying the two Guangdongs, and inherit the unfinished ambition of the Northern Expedition of the Prime Minister, one can eliminate the hidden dangers of internal disputes within the party, and the other can avoid the fear of stopping the army and aging the division. Therefore, he took the opportunity to ask Ye to persuade Zhao to participate in the revolution and jointly launch the Northern Expedition. Ye said: Zhao is a generous person, this is a very unusual thing, he will definitely not be able to decide, but Tang Shengzhi, who stationed troops in southern Hunan, is quite ambitious, or he can talk about this. So Li urged Ye to persuade Tang to participate in the revolution, and Ye also agreed very much. Li also deliberately made this matter appear in the newspapers, saying that Ye was representing Tang to Guangdong and Guangxi to negotiate. Soon after, this news was known to Wu and Zhao, and they suspected that Tang had different intentions, and they controlled him even more. Tang was very afraid, and his explanation to Wu and Zhao was ineffective, and he was forced more and more, so he decided to drive away Zhao, first launching an attack to seize Changsha and Yueyang, and sending a telegram to Guilin to deploy troops in Huangshahe as support. At this point, Wu Peifu was greatly enraged, and immediately sent a large army to assist Zhao in suppressing Tang. Tang's foothold was not yet stable, and he retreated to Hengzhou. Li saw that the time was ripe, and on the one hand, he sent troops to Hunan to assist Tang, and on the other hand, he telegraphed the central government to decide on the great plan of the Northern Expedition as soon as possible. Tang also sent representative Liu Wendao to Guangdong to ask for assistance. The central government then decided to swear an oath to launch the Northern Expedition on July 15th of the fifteenth year. Since then, the revolutionary armies of Guangdong and Guangxi, under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Jiang, entered Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and were victorious everywhere. Li, as the commander of the 7th Army, had only 10,000 troops, and fought forward, attacking stubborn enemies, and people at that time called the 7th Army the Steel Army.

The Revolutionary Regime: Turning Danger into Safety

Since the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party has participated in the National Revolution by joining the Kuomintang, and has been plotting to usurp the leadership of the Kuomintang. In the spring of the fifteenth year, the Zhongshan warship incident in Guangzhou was its beginning. At that time, it was fortunate that President Chiang was so decisive and suppressed it, so he was slightly restrained. After Hubei and Jiangxi were settled, Jiang ZhengÁù£Â∏àNanchang, the conspiracy of the Communist PartyÂ§çÊàñÂÖöÊîøÂÜõÂêÑÁ∫ßÂπ≤ÈÉ®ÈòüÊÑèÊîªÂáªËíãÂÖ¨, Êõ¥ÊâòËæûÂõΩÊ∞ëÊîøÂ∫úÂ∫îËÆæÁ´ã‰∫éÊ≠¶Ê±â, ‰ºÅÂõæÂà¶ÊåÅÊîøÂ∫ú, ‰ª•Êé®ÂÄíËíãÂÖ¨‰πãÂÜõ‰∫ãÁªüÂ∏ÖÊùÉ„ÄÇJiang GongÂøµÈù©ÂëΩÂ§ß‰∏öÊú™Á´ü, ‰∏çÂøçÂÜÖÈÉ®Á∫∑‰∫â, ‰πÉÊõ≤‰ªéÂÖ∂ËÆÆ, Â∑≤ÂàôÁéáÂ∏à‰∏ú‰∏ã, ÈÅÇÂÆöÊ±üÂçó, ËÄåÂÖ±ÂÖöÈò¥Ë∞ã‰∫¶ÊÑàËÇÜ, ‰∏ÄËÄåÂèëÂä®‰∫¨Ê≤™Êö¥Âä®ÁΩ¢Â∑•, ‰∏ÄÈù¢ËØ¨Ë∞§ËíãÂÖ¨‰∏∫Êñ∞ÂÜõÈòÄ, ‰ª•ÁÖΩÂä®Èù©ÂëΩÂÜõ‰πãÂêÑÂ∞ÜÈ¢Ü, Áî≥Ë®ÄËØ∑ËíãÂÖ¨‰∏ãÈáé„ÄÇÂΩìÊó∂Èù©‰ªëÂÜõ‰∏≠‰π¶Â∞ÜÂèäÊâÄÂ±ûÂπ≤ÈÉ®Ë¢´ÂÖ∂ËõäÊÉëËÄÖÂ§™Âçä, ÊÉüÊùéÊ∞èÂπ∂ÊâÄÁªüÁéá‰πãÁ¨¨‰∏ÉÂÜõ‰∏éÁ¨¨ÂçÅ‰πùÂÜõ, Â±πÁÑ∂‰∏ç‰∏∫ÊâÄÂä®„ÄÇÁÑ∂ÂΩìÊó∂ÊÉÖÂäøÂ∑≤ÁîöÂç±ÊÄ•, ÊùéÊ∞è‰πÉËµ¥Ê≤™‰∏éÂ∞ÜÂÖ¨ÂØÜÂïÜ, Âª∫ËÆÆËøÖÈÄüÊ∏ÖÂÖö, Âπ∂Êí§Êç¢Á¨¨‰∏ÄÂÜõ‰∏≠ÊÑèÂøóÂä®Êëá‰πãÈáçË¶ÅÂπ≤ÈÉ®, ‰∏îÂç≥Ë∞ÉÁ¨¨‰∏ÉÂÜõ¬∑ÂçÅ‰πùÂÜõÁî±ËöåÂü†ÂõûÈïá‰∫¨¬∑Ëäú¬∑‰∏ÄÂ∏¶, Âá°Ê≠§ÁöÜ‰∏éËíãÂÖ¨ÊÑèÊó®Á¨¶Âêà, Á´ãËßÅÊñΩË°å, ‰∫éÊòØÂç±Êú∫Ê∂àÂº≠, ËÄåÂçó‰∫¨ÂõΩÊ∞ëÊîøÂ∫ú‰∫¶ÈÅÇ‰∫éÊòØÊó∂ÁªÑÊàê„ÄÇËíãÂÖ¨ÊóãÂç≥Êå•Â∏àÂåóËøõ, Âç†ÊçÆÂæêÊµ∑, ÊòØÊó∂Ê≠¶Ê±âÊñπÈù¢‰∫¶Âá∫ÂÖµÂπ≥Ê±âË∑ØÂåóÊÆµ, È©±ÈÄêÂ•âÂÜõ‰∫éÈªÑÊ≤≥ÂçóÂ≤∏, ËøõÂç†ÂºÄÂ∞ÅÈÉëÂ∑û, ÁÑ∂Âõ†‰∏çÂ†™ÂÖ±ÂÖö‰πãÈ™ö‰π±ÂéãËø´, Âç≥ÂõûÂ∏àÊ≠¶Ê±â, ‰∏æË°åÂàÜÂÖ±, È°æ‰ªçÂÜ≥ËÆ°Êé®ÂÄíÂçó‰∫¨ÊîøÂ∫ú‰πãÈ¢ÜÂØºÊùÉ, ‰πÉ‰πò‰∫¨Ê≤™ÂÖµÂäõËñÑÂº±‰πãÈôÖ, Ê¥æÂ§ßÂÜõ‰∏ú‰∏ã, ËøõË¢≠È¶ñÈÉΩ, Âπ∂Áî≥Ë®ÄÈùûËíãÂÖ¨‰∏ãÈáé, ‰∏çËÉΩÂÖç‰∫éÂÖµÊàéÁõ∏ËßÅ, ËíãÂÖ¨ÈõÖ‰∏çÊ¨≤‰ª•‰∏Ä‰∫∫‰πãÊïÖËá¥Ëµ∑ÂÜÖÊàò, ‰πÉÁøªÁÑ∂ÂºïÈÄÄ, ÊåΩÁïôÊó†Êïà„ÄÇ

In the seventeenth year, the Northern Expedition was completed, and the whole country was unified. In the nineteenth year, Li's Ministry returned to Guangxi, and with Bai Chongxi and Huang Xuchu, they devoted themselves to the construction of the province. In a few years, the effects were remarkable. People from other provinces went to visit, and they all expressed their admiration, and praised it as a model province.

After the "September 18th" Incident, Li knew that the Japanese pirates' ambition would never cease, and that there would be no way to save the country without resisting Japan. He advocated the "scorched earth resistance theory," and many discerning people admired his ability to foresee the future.

Anti-Japanese Achievements Shocked China and Foreign Countries

When the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, Supreme Commander Jiang called on the whole country to engage in the War of Resistance. Li was summoned to Beijing to discuss major plans. Soon after, he was stationed in Xuzhou as the commander of the Fifth War Zone. In the winter of the 26th year, the capital fell, and Han Fuju, the chairman of Shandong Province, retreated without a fight. Jinan fell to the enemy, and the Japanese army was gathered on the north and south of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Xuzhou was a place of four battles, and he was worried about being surrounded and attacked. Li adhered to the strategy of the Supreme Commander, calmly deployed, and encouraged his comrades to defend vigorously, creating the great victory of Taierzhuang, which shocked China and foreign countries. This battle not only inflicted heavy damage on the enemy army, but also increased the confidence of our soldiers and civilians in winning the War of Resistance. Moreover, it delayed the Japanese army's movements, so that they did not dare to drive straight in, and our troops who retreated westward were able to calmly reorganize and deploy, so there was a protracted war on the periphery of Wuhan. Therefore, Chinese and foreign military commentators also praised the defense of the Battle of Xuzhou as an amazing achievement in the history of China's War of Resistance. Later, Li entered Anhui and Hubei from Jiangsu to command the army, with a total of thousands of miles of battle, stationed in Xiangdu for six years, during which there were repeated battles, and repeatedly repelled strong enemies, and the land in northern Hubei and southern Henan was able to be secured from beginning to end. In the spring of the 34th year, he was promoted to the director of the Hanzhong Office. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he was transferred to the director of the Beiping Office until now.

Open-minded and Generous, Firm and Calm

To sum up, although the length is not short, there are still many omissions in Li's life deeds. As for his great achievements, brilliant plans, and contributions to the transfer of the situation to the party and the country, there are indeed many and huge, and the discerning people have their own opinions, and there is no need to write more. As for his firm and calm attitude in times of crisis and shock, his decisive response to the situation, and his compliance with the appropriate measures, these are Li's strengths, and it is far beyond the reach of ordinary people. Moreover, Li's nature is kind and generous, he treats people with sincerity, he is amiable and approachable, and he leads a simple life, and he does not engage in extravagance. It is appropriate that his fame is known throughout the country, and those who admire him are countless. Li is open-minded and generous, he knows people well and is good at assigning them, and he is especially able to give them convenience and make the most of their talents, so people are happy to use them for him. All those who have been under his command and have made outstanding achievements and become famous generals and commanders have been heard to be more than ten people.

### Boundless Longevity

‚Äî Cheng Tiexuan

One person stabilizes the country, early in his meritorious deeds of great service, ten thousand households return to spring, the spirit of the coiling dragon is flourishing. The vast suburbs and the purple frontier, how difficult was the creation, the bright sun and blue sky, the admiration is doubled. We respectfully praise our Chairman, now President Jiang of Fenghua, who inherited his aspirations since childhood. Exhausting principles and studying minutiae, he excelled in Sun Wu's leopard strategy, renewing and reforming, praising Tang Wu's great plan. Holding the axe north, foxes and rats were exhausted, raising the halberd east to punish, the whale did not wave. He harmonized with all nations, and internal affairs prospered. He swept away the blemishes and filth, and turned weakness into strength. His name matched that of Mount Song, and his achievements were in the footsteps of Yu, and his deeds were obvious to all, without further elaboration. Now, I respectfully take his sincere heart of spreading virtue and teaching, and his great undertaking of revitalizing education and cultivating talents, and describe its main points, and append it to the chapters, to serve as a law for the world.

Since ancient times, the simplicity or flippancy of the world has been influenced by the rise and fall of civilization and education. Guangwu used it to revive the dynasty by laying down arms and lecturing on the arts, and the Tang Dynasty achieved prosperity by building schools and promoting culture. He modeled himself on past sages, and cultivated the masses. He played strings and sang in times of difficulty, and regarded schools as the most urgent task. He revealed virtue, intelligence, physical fitness, and groupism as four goals, and examined the roots and branches, priority and sequence with one heart. Feeling the frivolous customs of scholars and the trend of people towards evil and perversion. Competing with each other with strength, indulging in snail-horn disputes, only seeking profit, not hesitating to get up at cockcrow, so he corrected them with the four dimensions. Learning is against what is used, and industry does not seek perfection. Building a car behind closed doors, how can the tracks conform to the middle road? Returning the pearl and buying the casket, the skin and hair are only attacked by others, so he medicated them with the six arts. Counting the classics and forgetting their ancestors, thickening oneself and thinning the group. Folding hands to rise and fall, saying that the barbarians are not worth distinguishing, measuring the body to manage the chaos, if Qin and Yue are not related, so he enlightened them with the great meaning of the nation. People can conquer nature, and instruments do not seek old ones. Treasures have not been opened, and it is urgent to use divine work, stagnation will eventually fall into the wilderness, so he benefited them with scientific knowledge. Other things such as nourishing the mind, strengthening the body, advocating simplicity and frugality, practicing diligence, both hands are omnipotent, and spirit is superior to material. Incorporating the small self into the big self, equally in peace and war. None of them are in accordance with the times, and the success is to encourage. He aroused the deaf and awakened, like receiving the sound of morning bells and evening drums. Those who have achieved virtue and talent all benefit from the transformation of the rain and spring breeze. The National Chengchi University was founded in a difficult and arduous meeting, and operated in a dismal situation. The trees have grown into shade, and the foothills of Zijin Mountain are lush. The elites are covered by the benefits, and the vermilion paper corridors are green. Changes started in You and Yan, and the harm of the Japanese mulberry finally broke out. He moved to Kui and Shu, and opened the flowers of peaches and plums everywhere. Those who graduated from this school, some went out to respond to the people, some entered to assist the central government, some taught in Jiaoxiang, or some mediated at the wine table, but he was still able to help the world and not fail the country. It was his face-to-face instructions, which could remove their ignorance and show them the way.

East Japanese pirates are subdued, and the South Country is restored. In April of the thirty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the society moved from Bayu to the capital, and the palace wall was in sight, and the Big Dipper was shining. On the occasion of the sixtieth birthday, he offered the elegant praises of Shengshen. Thinking of building hundreds of walls, to commemorate thousands of years. Therefore, he gathered workers and materials, and began to build things. Based on the meaning of holding up the horn, he offered this hall of longevity. Towering like hills and mountains, how beautiful is the revolving building. He takes longevity as the country, and forgets to nourish the body while nourishing the house. Ten thousand rooms sheltered many scholars for joy, and the four seas sang one person for celebration. Extending the love of plants, trees, insects, and fish, as if climbing the Terrace of Laozi, wishing that those who offer grass and pheasants and rabbits would come, there is even greater garden of King Wen. (Note: Mr. Cheng's manuscript was originally written for the National Chengchi University Alumni Association to present the Hall of Longevity, because the full text elaborates on the President's spirit of promoting education and cultivating talents in detail, it is specially recorded above.)

### President on Constitutional Governance

The constitution is the fundamental law of the country and cannot be compared to ordinary laws and regulations. The constitution is a code of law adhered to by the whole country. On the one hand, it must also take into account the current situation of the country. Our ideal is the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution left by the Founding Father. The reality of our country is that the country and society have undergone long-term evolution and progress since the War of Resistance. Only a constitution that takes into account both ideals and reality is a constitution that is suitable for national conditions and is perfect and feasible. Only then can it guarantee long-term stability and security for the country and genuine happiness for compatriots. (Opening speech at the National Assembly in November of the 35th year of the Republic of China)

We are about to implement constitutional government. The people are the main body of the country. From now on, the destiny of the country is entirely in the hands of the people of the whole country today. While the government cannot shirk its responsibilities, the people must also properly fulfill their obligations to the country. (New Year's Day Broadcast Address to the People of the Whole Country in the 36th year of the Republic of China)

The best law and discipline for human organization is universal politics‚Äîthat is, the politics of the Principle of Democracy. To stipulate the obligations and rights of each citizen, we rely entirely on the rule of law and discipline as the standard of leveling. (The System of the Three Principles of the People and Its Implementation Procedures)

Freedom and the rule of law are inseparable. Freedom must be within the legal boundaries to be freedom. If it exceeds the legal boundaries, it is indulgence and willfulness. Only when everyone strictly observes the legal boundaries can they reach the realm where everyone has freedom. A country where everyone is free can be said to be a country ruled by law. (China's Destiny)

The people must develop a spirit of independence and initiative towards political systems, laws, regulations, and rules, and grasp the center of gravity, so that political systems and laws and regulations can be placed in a sound and effective domain. Self-strengthening is the basis of freedom, and self-reliance is the basis of independence. If the people cannot be self-strengthening and self-reliant, then the status of independence and freedom will inevitably be gained and lost one day. Therefore, the people are the driving force behind political construction, and the spirit of independence and initiative is the basis for enriching political construction. Only then can the national organization of China be sound, and the national administration can improve its efficiency. Therefore, future political construction should be based on the people's spirit of independence and initiative, and the most basic items are cultivating the people's rights and strengthening the national defense system. (China's Destiny)

Our Chinese democratic system will never be modeled after the democratic system of individualism and class concepts in 19th-century Europe and the United States. The construction of our country's politics must establish the foundation of the Five-Power Constitution and universal politics, not be fooled by empty slogans, not be confused by hypocritical forms, and proceed step by step, earnestly practice, so that China can become a modern democratic country and join the ranks of the international community. (China's Destiny)

If the people of a country cannot care about their own happiness and manage their own common affairs, that is to say, if the people cannot actively participate in politics, they cannot build a strong and solid country. Therefore, the most powerful and solid politics in the world must be built on public opinion, must take the interests of the people as their own, and take the people's hearing and vision as their own. The Prime Minister's democratic ideal is to create a country of, by, and for the people, which is the same throughout ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. (Closing speech at the Third Session of the Political Participation Council on February 21 of the 28th year of the Republic of China)

The public opinion on which democratic politics is based must be sound, collective, and representative of the will of the majority. The freedom granted to the people by democratic politics must be freedom that does not harm public interests and does not violate national laws. In order to effectively protect the interests of all the people and the entire nation, those who destroy laws, discipline, and systems must be sanctioned according to law. (Ibid.)

What is democracy? Democracy is freedom. The so-called freedom must be based on not infringing on the freedom of others, not infringing on the rights of others, and strictly abiding by discipline. Freedom must be guaranteed by law and be the basis for implementing freedom. Only this kind of freedom can become true freedom, and only this kind of freedom can become true democracy. (Closing speech at the Political Participation Council on July 6 of the 27th year of the Republic of China)

The effectiveness of constitutional government does not lie in the articles and forms of the constitution, but in possessing the spirit of constitutional governance. In China, during the Three Dynasties, we already had the scale of constitutional governance in which the people discussed and participated in politics. Since the Republic of China, there have been proclamations of provisional laws and constitutions and the establishment of two houses of parliament. But what contributions has this constitution and this parliament made to the Chinese nation and people? It can be said that it has only been harmful and not beneficial to the country and people. I believe that since the Republic of China, our constitution and parliament have had no foundation. The constitution is false and does not meet the needs of the country. The parliament does not understand its own responsibilities to the country and the people. The members themselves cannot respect the duties and moral obligations that representatives of the people should have. The biggest problem with our past parliaments is that they forgot the inherent spirit of our Chinese nation. What is our inherent spirit? It is "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame." These four words are explained in modern language: propriety is order, righteousness is responsibility, integrity is respecting others, and shame is respecting oneself. This is the same meaning as the three sentences in our ancient saying: "Live in honor, work with respect, and be loyal to others." Our past members ignored this meaning, did not know how to abide by the law and be responsible, respect others, and respect themselves, so it is no wonder that they relied on their positions to delay national affairs, resulting in the desecration of the dignity of the country and deepening the suffering of the people. (Speech in September of the 28th year of the Republic of China on "The Necessary Understanding of Implementing Constitutional Government")

Our only important problem at present is how to ensure unity and how to establish democracy, in other words, how to realize the Three Principles of the People. We must know that there must be true unity before there can be true democracy. (Closing speech at the Political Consultative Conference)

The matter of constitution-making should be entirely for the benefit of the country and the people. We should not only pay attention to the past, but also consider the present and the future. For the past, we should pay attention to the history of our country and the consistent national conditions, and the painful lessons since the Republic of China. For the present, we should take into account the actual environment of the War of Resistance and national construction, and at the same time, for the future, we should also take into account the future situation within ten or twenty years after the promulgation of the constitution and the long-term plan for the nation-state, and lay a good foundation for the constitution on how to enrich the national self-defense forces, how to develop the happiness of all the people, and how to consolidate the true rights of the people, all of which must be considered very carefully. I often say that the most important thing about the meaning of action is earnestness, and that we must make sure that there is no way that cannot be done, so that constitutional government can stand firm.
