The strategic importance of the Southwest Sand Islands for national defense is particularly significant.

Traitorous Bandits Plot to Create Disturbances and Riots; Government Closely Monitoring; Unruly Elements to Face Severe Punishment
[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th Dispatch] According to sources concerned, the traitorous bandits' conspiracies to cause disturbances in the rear are becoming increasingly blatant. They are not only dispatching spies to probe military intelligence, plotting arson, sabotaging warehouses, planting landmines, and derailing tracks, but also actively planning to incite labor and student unrest, merging them into a major riot. Recently, the traitorous party members lurking in various universities have become more obviously violent in their words and actions. Since January, they have been universally distributing intimidating propaganda in universities across the north and south. According to reliable intelligence, the traitorous bandits intend to create disturbances and riots in various important cities in the rear around the opening of the National Assembly on March 29th. It is reported that the government is closely monitoring this matter, and those unruly elements who have completely lost their student status and willingly allow themselves to be used by the traitorous party will be severely punished. Local school authorities are also paying special attention to the actions of these "professional students." Neutral students, seeing that their studies will be affected, are deeply vigilant and plan to jointly assist the school authorities in preventing riots. They will also expose the "professional students" who have recently distributed traitorous propaganda to curb the source of the unrest.

Adjusting Public Education and Civil Servant Salaries to Compensate for Increased Expenditures; Will Be Submitted to the Executive Yuan Meeting for Discussion
[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th Dispatch] The method of adjusting the salaries of public education employees and civil servants monthly according to the cost-of-living index is currently being studied by the Executive Yuan. The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics is also conducting a detailed statistical analysis of the salaries of civil and military personnel, as well as the public expenses for students and the supplementary rations for officers and soldiers. According to a responsible source, the total number of civil and military personnel throughout the country, both central and local, is estimated at six million. If each person receives an increase of 10,000 (currency unit not specified) per month, the increased expenditure would be 60 billion (currency unit not specified) per month. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance is currently studying ways to compensate for this increase in expenditure due to salary adjustments, so that revenue and expenditure can be balanced. This proposal is being actively studied by all parties and is scheduled to be submitted for discussion at the Executive Yuan's regular meeting next Tuesday.

Ministry of Finance Strives to Eliminate Black Market Foreign Exchange Transactions
[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th Dispatch] Regarding preventing capital flight and cracking down on the black market for foreign exchange, the Ministry of Finance has long been paying attention. At the end of last month, the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau, together with the Shanghai Police Bureau, launched a large-scale investigation of privately-run Hong Kong exchange institutions, discovering 43 privately-run Hong Kong exchange businesses and arresting over 50 suspects. Evidence is being reviewed, and they will be sent to the courts for legal proceedings. The investigation of private high-power radio stations is continuing, and rewards are offered for reporting, in order to completely eliminate black market foreign exchange transactions. Furthermore, the Sino-Hong Kong Financial Agreement contains detailed regulations to block the flight of funds to Hong Kong, and more effective results can be achieved once the aforementioned agreement is implemented.

Viewing Our Merchants: Plot to Monopolize Fisheries Production
[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th Dispatch] Chinese merchants who came to Japan from Hong Kong today said that the Hong Kong government discriminates against Chinese merchants. They claimed that when the Hong Kong government issues import permits for Japanese seafood to be exported to the UK, it refuses to issue such import permits to Chinese merchants who want to import seafood into Hong Kong. This proves that the Hong Kong government intends to use British commercial organizations to monopolize fisheries production in the Hong Kong area.

US House Foreign Affairs Committee Passes Military and Economic Aid to China Bill; Encourages China to Maintain Administrative Integrity
[US Information Service, Washington, 19th Dispatch] The House Foreign Affairs Committee today passed the 6.205 billion US dollar US foreign aid bill by a vote of 15 to 0. The bill is expected to be acted upon by the full House next week and includes 5.3 billion US dollars for the European Recovery Program, 570 million US dollars for economic and military aid to China, 270 million US dollars for aid to Greece and Turkey, and 60 million US dollars for the International Children's Emergency Fund.

The 570 million US dollars in aid to China will include 150 million US dollars in military aid, with the remaining 420 million US dollars to be handled by the proposed Recovery Program Administration.

Republican Congressman Judd explained that this division is to prevent military aid to China from being mixed up with economic issues. The aid to China has been revised to approve the establishment of a five-member joint committee for rural reconstruction in China. The bill will authorize the committee to use 5% to 10% of the 420 million US dollars for rural reconstruction projects. The committee will include two Americans and three Chinese. Judd stated that the conditions and restrictions included in the European Recovery Program section of the bill will apply to economic aid to China. He said that the conditions for military aid to Greece and Turkey will apply to military aid to China. At the same time, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee announced that it had unanimously passed a bill approving 275 million US dollars to continue aid to Greece and Turkey. Work on the aid to China bill will begin on Saturday.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th Dispatch] The US House Foreign Affairs Committee tonight passed the merger of 150 million US dollars in military aid and 420 million US dollars in economic aid to China under the Foreign Assistance Act.

When drafting the economic aid plan, the committee stated in the preamble to the bill that US policy is to encourage China's efforts to maintain genuine independence and administrative integrity and to support and strengthen individual freedoms and free institutions through programs based on self-help and cooperation. In addition, it acknowledges that the current situation in China threatens the establishment of lasting peace, US national interests, and the achievement of the United Nations' goals.

Third Day of National Assembly Delegate Registration; Overseas Chinese Delegate Zhang Zitian and Others Arrive in Nanjing; Delegates Insist on Attending Assembly After Signing Nomination
[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th Dispatch] The 20th was the third day of National Assembly delegate registration. Due to the heavy rain in the capital all day, the registration office was even more deserted. A total of 15 people registered for the entire day, bringing the total to 62, with women's organizations accounting for the largest proportion, at 23, followed by Jiangsu Province, with 9. Those who registered today include Zhu Jiahua, Tian Peilin, and Hu Dingan. Zhu was the first incumbent head of a ministry or commission to register. It is also learned that 35 people are en route and will arrive soon. In addition to National Assembly delegate registration, registration procedures are also being carried out for two items: news reporters for observing sessions and automobile permits. As of tonight, over 160 units have registered as reporters, and over 160 automobile permits have been applied for, a coincidence. At the same time, the number of reporters registered exceeds the number of National Assembly delegates registered by over 100, leading some to say that the observers are being overly enthusiastic.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th Dispatch] Overseas Chinese National Assembly delegates from Central and South America, Zhang Zitian (Canada), Zheng Rongkai (Central America), Chen Zhonghai (United States), Xu Rongnuan (Cuba), and Zhang Zizai (Cuba), arrived in Nanjing by train from Shanghai in the afternoon of the 20th.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th Dispatch] The results of the National Assembly elections continue to be reported to the Election Headquarters. As of the evening of the 20th, the total number of delegates was 2,825.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th Dispatch] National Assembly delegates who were elected by signature nomination still insist on their eligibility and are preparing to attend the assembly. Their "Elected National Assembly Delegates Office" held its third reception for reporters at noon on the 20th, declaring the above determination. It is learned that the total number of delegates with issues related to signature nomination and party nomination is over 800. The problem of these 800 delegates has not been resolved. The approximately 400-500 delegates elected by signature nomination are scheduled to gather in Nanjing on the 24th and 25th and register at the same time. Delegate Ma Wenche and others told reporters on the 20th that if they are not allowed to attend, they will automatically assemble and express their views. Ma and others still insist that "letting the party cede to the party," filling out certificates of renunciation of election, and canceling candidate qualifications are all illegal and therefore unacceptable.

When I attend the National Assembly and vote in the presidential election, I will sincerely elect President Chiang as President."

Chinese Land Reform Association Suggests Land Reform; Drafts Plan to Submit to Government
[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th Dispatch] The Chinese Land Reform Association held a press conference for Chinese and foreign reporters at 3:30 PM on the 20th, hosted by Xiao Zheng, Chairman of the Association, and Standing Directors Bao Deshu, Huang Tong, and Ren Zhuoxuan, announcing the Chinese Land Reform Plan drafted by the Association. Xiao Zheng gave a detailed explanation of the Association's purpose and the key points of the land reform plan, saying that the current land problem in China has reached a point where reform is imperative. The only way to overcome the current difficulties and save China's destiny is to implement land reform. Xiao Zheng pointed out that this land reform plan is more radical than the government's past "Regulations for Handling Land in Pacification Zones" and the methods currently being discussed by the Central China Pacification Headquarters. However, it does not endorse the land policies implemented by the Communists, such as killing landlords and redistributing land. There are many reasons why land reform in China has not been completed, and one reason is that Chinese farmers have not yet awakened themselves. Therefore, this plan is being made public to arouse attention from all parties. Before suggesting it to the government, it is first suggested to the masters of China, hoping that all parties will promote it. The contents of the plan (passed by the Board of Directors of the Land Reform Association on February 19) are recorded below:

Preamble: The Chinese Land Reform Association, recognizing the severity of the current land problem in China, which has become the root of all chaos and the key to the nation's survival, and that the government's current land policies and laws are insufficient to fundamentally solve this problem, believes that if a thorough and widespread reform is not urgently sought, there will be very terrible consequences. The Association has proclaimed the principle of "land to the tiller" in its founding declaration (full text of the declaration published on page 3). Based on current needs, it now proposes this preliminary land reform plan in order to quickly and universally achieve the goal of "tiller owning his land" and to realize the spirit of Article 143 of the Constitution.

Chapter 1: Goals of Land Reform: The goal of land reform is that the tiller owns his land, so all farmland in the country should, from this day forward, belong to the current tiller.

Chapter 2: Terminating the Tenancy System and Transforming Tenants into Owner-Farmers: Farmers who currently till the land of others should pay off the land price in installments to obtain land ownership and transform from tenants into owner-farmers. The above-mentioned land price shall be seven times the current rent amount, payable in fourteen years. However, if the current rent amount exceeds 37.5% of the regular output, it should still be calculated at 37.5%.

Chapter 3: Paying off the Land Price to Obtain Land Ownership: (1) When current tenant farmers obtain land, they must register with the local authorities through the township tenant farmer association. (2) The rent paid annually as payment for the land price shall be collected by the township tenant farmer association and paid to the original landowner, and reported to the local government for record. (3) If the direct relatives of active-duty soldiers are tenant farmers, the land price they must pay to obtain land will be paid by the government.

Chapter 4: Transferring Land Rights and Paying off Debts: (1) From the first year of paying land rent to pay off the land price, the land ownership of the original landowner shall be terminated and transferred to the original tenant farmer. The original landowner should submit their land ownership certificate to the local land administration agency in exchange for land price coupons (triplicate fourteen copies) appropriate to the total amount of their seven years of rent. Tenant farmers who obtain land shall pay one-fourteenth of the land price each year in exchange for one copy of the original landowner's land price coupon. After the land price is fully paid off in the fourteenth year, they shall submit it to the land administration agency to obtain their land ownership certificate. (2) The original landowner shall no longer pay land tax, and the government shall not levy any tax on the land price they receive. (3) The new owner-farmers who obtain land are obligated to pay land tax. Before their land price is fully paid off, this land tax shall not exceed 10% of the annual production value of their land.

Chapter 5: Exempting Land Surcharges and Facilitating Funding: (1) Before the implementation of this plan, current tenant farmers who are unable to pay rent and are in arrears shall not be pursued for payment. After the implementation of this plan, in case of famine, the government may, at its discretion, approve the postponement of payment of all or part of the land price for that year. (2) When new owner-farmers need to borrow production funds for agricultural operations, local national financial institutions shall be responsible for facilitating them. This debt can only be secured by land income and cannot result in the confiscation of land, houses, or other means of production due to debt.

Chapter 6: Eradicating Land Consolidation and Improving Agricultural Operations: (1) Any person who is not engaged in self-cultivation shall not purchase farmland. (2) All existing owner-farmers or new owner-farmers should join local agricultural cooperatives. (3) Implement farmland consolidation, adjust and expand the area of farms.

Chapter 7: Organizing Tenant Farmer Associations to Promote Land Reform: In order to thoroughly implement land reform, tenant farmers in various regions should organize tenant farmer associations to handle land registration and collect land prices on their behalf. The organizational methods of tenant farmer associations shall be determined separately.

Weekly Forum: On the Tasks and Policies of the Central Bank by Zhang Zhengli

I. Introduction

Although the development of modern central banks has been going on for a century, the high degree of development of their policies and calibration has only occurred in the past thirty years. Since World War I, due to the gold standard, followed by a global panic, and the breakdown of international monetary and credit systems, the tasks of central banks have become increasingly immense. With the outbreak of World War II, central banks played an even more significant role in raising war funds and stabilizing finance. Their policies and facilities have also been continuously improved in response to the times and locations, developing into an independent and complete system. This article will first review the development trends of modern central banks, and then try to discuss the path that our country's central bank should follow.

II. Evolutionary Trends of Central Banks

Central banks are a natural product of the development of modern credit systems. If we purely observe the tasks of central banks from an economic perspective, they are nothing more than the following five points:

(1) Reducing the amount of idle reserves in the entire banking system so that loanable funds in the national economic system are used most effectively.

(2) In the event of an economic panic, the central bank has the power to create additional reserve funds, so the contractionary liquidation process can be avoided or delayed.

(3) On the other hand, excessive credit contraction or expansion caused by commercial banks taking parallel actions can be controlled or curbed by reducing reserve funds or increasing reserve ratios, as well as other regulatory methods.

(4) Central banks can provide effective services to commercial banks, especially for the clearing of bills.

(5) The sound operation of the central bank can create and maintain monetary and credit conditions that are conducive to the sound development of industry and commerce.

Based on the foregoing, it can be seen that the active role of central banks is actually much greater than the passive one. In other words, the true function of central banks is to support the sound development of national financial institutions and, in turn, promote the prosperity of industry and commerce. At the same time, although the power of central banks is extremely large, it has its limits. Although central banks can create more funds, they can never force businesses to take out loans. Conversely, although central banks can exercise credit contraction, they cannot arbitrarily depress price and cost structures. The movement of prices and costs is actually caused by other more fundamental factors. However, in any case, the sound operation of central banks is a key to a country's economic stability and development. In recent years, central banks in various countries have undergone major changes in policy mechanisms and technologies to complete their tasks. The most important of these are described below.

(1) Rationalization of the Relationship between Central Banks and Governments

The nationalization of central banks has been a common trend in recent years. Today, central banks that are completely state-owned include the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, China, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Finland, Latvia, Denmark, New Zealand, Bulgaria, Uruguay, Paraguay, Czechoslovakia, and Costa Rica. The only central bank established by commercial banks is the US Federal Reserve Bank. In addition, only a few countries, such as Switzerland, the Netherlands, Spain, and India, have central banks that are entirely funded by the people. This fact not only illustrates the increasingly close relationship between central banks and governments, but also shows the general trend of economic socialization. Although the relationship between central banks and governments is becoming increasingly close, the two are by no means one entity. Major countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and Australia, have strict restrictions on central bank loans to the government and the holding of government bonds. For example, the Central Bank of Canada's loans to the government are limited to one-third of the fiscal year's revenue budget and must be repaid before the first quarter of the following year. As for the holding of government bonds with a term of more than two years, it is limited to half of the total amount of banknotes issued and deposit liabilities. Although the Reserve Bank of India has no restrictions on the amount of advances to the government, it must be repaid within three months. The amount of government securities purchased by the bank is limited to three-fifths of its share capital, reserve fund, and deposit liabilities. In addition, countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States have similar legal regulations or customary restrictions. The effect of these restrictions is clearly to prevent the unlimited expansion of central bank advances to the government. Judging from the experience of the past twenty years, large-scale government borrowing, whether directly from the central bank or indirectly discounted, has been an effective way to promote expansion. Therefore, for the sake of the entire national interest, the relationship between the central bank and the government should be established on the basis of ordinary business relations. Indeed, the government should have the right to directly finance from the central bank in the event of urgent needs, and the latter should also provide the necessary convenience, but its status must be effectively guaranteed by law or custom. In this way, the central bank will not be reduced to the government's treasury and violate its own lofty mission.

(2) Abandonment of Ordinary Banking Business

In recent years, central banks in various countries have mostly abandoned all general banking business and devoted themselves to the completion of their own responsibilities. For example, central banks in countries such as Mexico, Australia, France, and Argentina used to have direct dealings with industry and commerce, but these have now been almost completely eliminated. Although the US Federal Reserve Bank is legally allowed to directly handle loans, it never abuses this power except in special circumstances, such as the Great Depression of 1931 or the urgent discounting of military industries during wartime. This is because central banks must have strong turnover power in peacetime in order to effectively control the market. If the central bank itself also engages in ordinary business, its liquidity will be greatly reduced, and it will be difficult to cope with a panic. Some people currently believe that central banks engaging in direct transactions can be used as a means of controlling credit and can also replace or supplement public market activities. This view is actually wrong. Central bank direct lending is not only narrow in scope and extremely ineffective, but will also seriously damage its independent position as the "bank of banks." From a more positive perspective, the completion of the central bank's tasks often depends on the active cooperation of general banks. If the central bank receives the deposit reserves of banks on the one hand and competes with them in business on the other hand, then the relationship between the rights and obligations of the two will be disproportionate. Normal cooperative relationships are difficult to establish, and the entire banking system will ultimately be difficult to grow soundly.

(3) Actively Engaging in Open Market Operations

The importance of open market operations lies in their ability to increase or decrease the total supply of bank funds, so that interest rates, prices, and commercial activities can be automatically adjusted. In the past ten years, open market operations in the United Kingdom and the United States have not only been a supplementary tool for bank interest rates, but have also become the main means of controlling credit. This is because the economic structures of modern countries have been strengthened, and government intervention has been intensified, and the implementation of managed currencies has made the efficiency of controlling credit by using the discount rate gradually decline. On the other hand, the increase in the types and quantities of government securities has further expanded the operational basis of open markets.

Although the application of open markets is extremely important, in reality, it is only used on a large scale in a few countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. This is because currently, only London and New York have markets for long-term and short-term government securities. However, other countries are also taking various measures to promote the establishment of government securities markets. For example, countries such as Canada, Australia, India, and Argentina are developing financial markets centered on treasury bills with the assistance of their respective central banks. Therefore, the application of open markets has also become increasingly important.

(4) Strengthening Credit Control

In modern countries, changes in the amount of credit often lead to changes in the purchasing power of money. Especially in countries with highly developed credit systems, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, the use of checks as payment instruments accounts for almost 90% of the total payments, while the deposit reserves of general commercial banks are only about 10%. Therefore, the maximum limit for banks to expand credit may reach ten times the amount of deposits. The importance of credit control is self-evident. In the past, the most commonly used control methods in various countries were raising and lowering discount rates, deposit reserves, or open market operations, as well as credit allocation and moral persuasion. In recent years, selective credit control has become extremely popular. The old agricultural bank law promulgated in Guatemala last year has particularly unique provisions on selective credit control. Article 80 of its new banking law states:

"In order to regulate the total amount of credit and promote its allocation to fully meet the economic interests of the country, the Monetary Committee may take the following measures: (1) Revise the minimum amount of required capital and reserve funds. However, in any case, it must not fall below the level stipulated in Article 20. (2) Select investments placed in certain types of securities or loans, and strictly stipulate different ratios for various types of investments." (Reference: Federal Reserve Bulletin, April 1947)

Under this system, the central bank can selectively control the required capital amount of banks. In a period of high prosperity, it can use this tool to suppress the flow of production funds into speculative and expansionary channels. If the central bank believes that general banks are lending too much to a certain type of business, it can increase the required capital amount for this type of loan. Conversely, in a period when credit expansion is needed, it can reduce the required capital amount ratio for a certain type of investment or loan that it wants to encourage. This method is more effective and faster than general traditional methods. However, in actual application, it requires a high degree of skill and extreme caution.

Credit control is indeed the responsibility that modern central banks should bear, but credit control itself is by no means a "panacea." The effect of control depends on various objective conditions and execution techniques, especially in countries where the organization of financial markets is relatively loose. At the same time, central bank credit control should not be limited to bank credit, but should also cover various forms of credit such as production and commerce, such as book credit, bills of exchange, and promissory notes. Various credits used to purchase commodities, securities, and real estate all have the same function as money. Therefore, contemporary scholars such as Leaf, Anderson, and Dunkman have emphasized the importance of non-bank credit in the overall credit. We should not ignore this fact. [Continued on page 5]

Famous Figures from All Walks of Life in Shanghai Gather to Support President Chiang Kai-shek's Presidential Campaign; Recommend Li Zongren for Vice President
[Report from This Newspaper] Famous figures from all walks of life in the city held the Shanghai All Circles Support President Chiang Kai-shek's Presidential Campaign and Mr. Li Zongren's Vice Presidential Campaign Conference at the Lido Garden at 3:00 PM yesterday. Over 200 people attended, including Xu Jiyu, Du Yuesheng (represented by Zhu Wende), Chen Fengshi, Zhao Zengjue, Chen Guangfu, Jiang Yiping, Yuan Xiluo, Chuan Zhengmo, and Wang Xinheng. Yang Hu was publicly elected as chairman. First, Mr. Yang Xiaotian, the newly elected Supervisory Committee member from this city, delivered a speech, stating: "President Chiang Kai-shek's great achievements and virtues resonate throughout the world. Mr. Li Zongren has both literary and military talents and is highly regarded by public opinion. I am very excited to participate in this grand event today. I sincerely hope that all those with the right to vote will cast a ballot to elect the President and Vice President who are supported by the public." Then, Mr. Yuan Xiluo, a National Assembly delegate from Jibaoshan County before the Xinhai Revolution who is over seventy years old, delivered a speech. He traced the historical facts of the revolution over the past 37 years, comparing the current enthusiastic sentiment of the public supporting President Chiang Kai-shek as President to the people's support for Sun Yat-sen as the Provisional President in those years. He also highly praised General Li Zongren, believing that Li is the most suitable person to assist the head of state and assist in governing the country. Next, Senator Zhu Wende delivered a speech on behalf of Mr. Du Yuesheng, chairman of the Diligence Association. In addition to praising the achievements of the two gentlemen, he said: "President Chiang Kai-shek led the party and the country to complete the victory of the War of Resistance. The people admire virtue and reciprocate merit, and unanimously support him as the first President of China, just as the American people supported Washington as President after the independence and freedom of the United States. Success is inevitable." The applause sounded like thunder, and the emotions were unprecedentedly enthusiastic. Qian Jianqiu, Li Mingwei, Zhou Yizhi, and others then gave speeches separately, and the conference adjourned after 5:00 PM.

[This City Report] The former Shanghai All Circles Support Cheng Qian for Vice President Committee telegraphed Mr. Cheng, welcoming him to visit Shanghai.

Zhang Guogan, Hu Zongduo, Tian Huan, Xiang Songpo, Xiao Xuan, Li Lixia, Guo Taizhen, Tian Yongqian, Ouyang Zunquan, and others attended. It was decided to organize a committee to support Ju Zheng for Vice President, and it is planned to send telegrams to all parties to unanimously recommend him.

Beiping City Council Urges US Military Aid to China in Telegram
[Central News Agency, Beiping, 19th Dispatch] The first session of the second general assembly of the Beiping City Council unanimously passed a telegram to US President Truman and Congress urging prompt military aid to China. The telegram was sent this afternoon, forwarded by Ambassador Stuart. The telegram first stated the harm of the Communists to the country and the people: "The Communist Party has caused hunger and poverty among the people of our country, and has even coerced good people to join the Communist army, charging forward on the front lines and making meaningless sacrifices, causing endless internal strife. All of this is by no means comparable to a simple peasant revolution, and cannot be concealed simply by a land reform movement." It then analyzed the current situation of suppressing the bandits: "At present, the situation in eastern and northern China is extremely serious. Once the northeast and northern China are lost, China will not be able to survive in a corner. If China's vast manpower and abundant resources unfortunately fall into the hands of the Communist Party, it will be a great threat to the world's peaceful and democratic countries, and the area of the world's eight categories of freedom will also gradually shrink." Finally, it appealed to the United States to provide emergency assistance to our country based on past friendship: "Your country has always been the fortress of world democracy, so the Four Freedoms advocated by President Roosevelt are undergoing the same severe test as democracy. Based on the traditional friendship between our two countries and the protection of democracy, the colleagues of this council dare to and also have the right to request that your country provide effective assistance in terms of economy and military affairs as soon as possible. Only a free and democratic China can guarantee the existence of democracy, and only by quickly freeing China from the red threat of armed forces can the world be spared the ravages of war."

Hangzhou City Council Solicits Public Opinion Extensively; Receives All Sectors Before Meeting
[This Newspaper, Hangzhou, 20th Dispatch] The Hangzhou City Council meeting is about to open. This morning, it specially received over a hundred gentry and journalists from the city to extensively solicit public opinion. In addition to Mayor Zhang and Councilor Zhou giving reports, many sectors spoke out, and the central issues were how to solve the housing shortage and reduce the land tax. It was also proposed to open up the West Mountain area of West Lake, which could alleviate the housing shortage and prosper the market. The city government could issue bonds or financial circles from Shanghai and Hangzhou could organize a syndicate to invest in it. Yu Shaosong called for attention to public security issues, stating that of the ten prefectures in the province, only Quzhou has fewer bandits because the Pacification Commissioner's Office is stationed there. The people in other counties are not safe. Recently, refugees have gathered in Hangzhou, and public security in

Principles for Special Donation Solicitation Determined; To be Implemented in Shanghai After Approval by the Supervisory Committee; Public Criticism Should be Applied to the Wealthy and Ungenerous

〔Our Newspaper's Report〕The Shanghai District Special Donation for Relief Committee held its second meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the City Government Conference Room. Attendees included Deputy Director Yu Hongjun of the Special Donation Supervisory Committee, Supervisory Committee members Liu Butong and Jiang Yong, as well as Shanghai District Committee Chairman Wu Guozhen, Vice Chairmen Pan Gongzhan and Du Yuesheng, Committee Members Wu Xianxian, Xu Jiqi, Wang Xianqing, Qian Xinzhi, Dong Yunjhang, Qin Runqing, Shui Xiangyun, Cheng Cangbo, Wu YunChu, Fang Zhi, Li Fuxun, and Xi Yushu, along with Zhang Qiang, Speaker of the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly, Yan Xinhong, Speaker of the Wuxian Assembly, Li Tiping, Speaker of the Wuxi Assembly, Zhou Dalie, Speaker of the Yin County Assembly, and over twenty others. The meeting concluded at 5:00 PM. During the meeting, Deputy Director Yu elaborated in detail on the significance of this special donation drive (the full text can be found in the left corner). Afterwards, Mr. Yu hosted a reception for reporters in the conference room. He stated that the specific solicitation methods have not yet been finalized, but the principles have been determined. Mr. Yu and others will take them to Nanjing tonight, and after approval by the Supervisory Committee, they will be implemented in Shanghai. Mr. Yu stated that the central government's launch of the special donation for relief is not a tax but a fundraising effort. The disparity between the rich and poor is the main factor of social instability, and we hope to arouse the sympathy of the wealthy and generous to contribute generously to help the government overcome this difficult situation. The amount is not intended to be rigidly fixed, and it may be apportioned by various trade associations. The names of donors will not be published if they do not wish to be publicized. Those who are stingy will not be forced, but it is hoped that they will be subject to public and moral criticism.

Modifications Made to Solicitation Targets

Yesterday, reporters also visited Mayor Wu after the meeting. According to him, the point of creating a list of names has not yet been considered, because the fundraising method set by the central government is not practical. For example, if the targets set by the central government were those who made fortunes from national crises, victory, or suppressing rebellion, who in the country would be willing to donate money and then bear this bad name? Therefore, it was decided at yesterday's meeting to modify the fundraising targets to become great philanthropists. As for the progress of fundraising in this district, it will be based on the principle of unified management. The amount of fundraising in various places will not be rigidly fixed. The list of fundraising will be drafted by each location itself, and after it is approved by the general meeting, it will be managed uniformly.

Minister of Finance Hosts Press Conference, Reports Three Measures to Stabilize Finances; Proposed Amendments to Tariff Rates and Levy of Temporary Surtax

〔Our Newspaper's Report〕Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun met with reporters from various newspapers in the City Government Conference Room at 5:00 PM yesterday to report on the central government's three measures to stabilize the city's finances as follows: (1) Eliminating the problem of speculative hot money in Shanghai: Shanghai is the financial hub of the country, and hot money is concentrated here, which is inevitable. The government's revision of the Banking Law, the use of interest rate policies, the strict formulation of loan policies, and the strengthening of financial business management, as well as the improvement of the securities market, are all measures to channel hot money and eliminate speculation. In order to prevent illegal transactions in the black market of gold and banknotes, a Financial Administration Bureau has been established, hoping to work closely with local governments. Although the effectiveness is great, illegal transactions of gold and banknotes still exist. The Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to this and is determined to eradicate it. I (the 20th) convened a meeting this morning with Li Du, Director of the Customs General Administration; Ding Guitang, Tax Commissioner; Huang Zupei, Director of the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau; Shi Shouzhang, Director of the Commodity Tax Bureau; and Li Lixia, Director of the Shanghai Financial Administration Bureau to review and thoroughly eliminate speculative methods for absorbing hot money. The relevant agencies will proceed separately and cooperate with each other.

Profits Tax to be Collected More Quickly

(2) Regarding the estimated payment method for profits tax: it is stipulated that six times the tax value paid in the previous year shall be paid on a regular basis first, because the government's expenditures have increased sharply and the old tax law is no longer applicable. The United Kingdom, France, and other countries have also adopted a pay-as-you-earn system. The government's expenditure budget for this year is about twenty times higher than last year, so it has been decided to accelerate tax collection to cover the expenses. Prices this year are about fifteen times higher than in 1946, and there should be no difficulty for merchants to pay profits tax at six times the amount. If their profits are indeed less than six times, the Central Bank will calculate and pay interest. It is hoped that merchants will understand the government's difficulties and cooperate to contract the currency. (3) Tariff issues: Our country's tariff rates have always been lower than those of other countries. The tax rules were set in 1934 and are no longer in line with reality. They are being prepared for amendment. In order to increase revenue, the government is preparing to levy a temporary surtax, but necessities such as cotton, flour, coal, and oil will be exempt.

Seeking to Completely Eliminate Import and Export Smuggling

I believe that the phenomenon of import and export smuggling must be completely eliminated, because its impact on tax revenue is secondary, and its obstruction of the national economy is serious. In the past, the most rampant smuggling was in South China. According to statistics, more than 23,000 smuggling cases were cracked last year, and smuggled goods worth more than 310 billion yuan were confiscated. From mid-January to mid-February this year, more than 2,900 smuggling cases were cracked, and smuggled goods worth more than 100 billion yuan were confiscated. The reason for this is that South China is adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau. In order to thoroughly eliminate smuggling, it has been decided to cooperate with the Hong Kong government. The central government is currently negotiating with the Hong Kong government authorities to formulate a Sino-Hong Kong customs agreement, but some of the articles still need to be promulgated and implemented after the Hong Kong government completes the legislative process. On the Macau side, the government authorities are also discussing anti-smuggling measures, and it is hoped that the phenomenon of smuggling will improve in the future. Minister Yu emphasized that the government's revised anti-smuggling regulations stipulate that smugglers will be subject to criminal penalties in addition to the confiscation of smuggled goods. It is firmly believed that the phenomenon of smuggling will decrease after the implementation of the new anti-smuggling regulations.

District Chiefs Concurrently Serving as Senators; City Government to Select One to Resign

〔Our Newspaper's Report〕Regarding the question of whether elected district chiefs in this city can concurrently serve as senators, according to the interpretation of the Ministry of the Interior, they cannot. The city government has already, based on internal explanations, instructed district chiefs who concurrently serve as senators in each district to select one to resign and no longer serve concurrently. It has been found that the senators elected as district chiefs in this city include Jin Dehuan of Jing'an District, Wang Jianfan of Xincheng District, and Zhong Yuliang of Gaoqiao District.

Provincial and Municipal Boundary Officially Determined; Zhuzhai Town Still Bounded by Panlong River; Newly Demarcated Urban Districts Subsidized as Usual

〔Our Newspaper's Report〕The boundary dispute between Shanghai and Jiangsu Province, which has been delayed for more than twenty years, has been greatly emphasized by the City Government after victory. The dispute has been repeatedly investigated on-site, and the opinions of local people have been taken into account. In October of last year, representatives of the Shanghai and Jiangsu Provincial governments met in Shanghai to hold a provincial and municipal boundary demarcation conference, and the agreed points were submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. After careful review by the Land Administration and Interior Ministries, it was decided to report the provincial and municipal boundaries and methods to the National Government for approval and record. The Executive Yuan has now ordered the city government to inform the Land Administration Bureau, and the provincial and municipal boundaries have been officially determined. The provincial and municipal boundaries and methods approved by the central government are as follows: (1) Boundary section: The Yunzaobang River serves as the boundary of the Shanghai North Datang District; The Chunshen River, Hengli River, and Quejia Tang serve as the boundary of the Shanghai South Xinzhuang District. The remainder follows previously approved standards. Regarding the affiliation of Zhuzhai Town, although some people in the area have requested to be incorporated into the city, the provincial and municipal governments have not agreed. The Panlong River will continue to serve as the natural boundary, with the north bank belonging to the province and the south bank belonging to the city. (2) Subsidy issues: There was a precedent before the war. After the newly demarcated urban districts are incorporated into Shanghai, the city government should subsidize them as usual, and the standards are the same as those for the old urban districts. (3) Land tax, public funds, public property, and local armed forces will be handled in accordance with the agreement between the two parties and will be approved for record.

Report on Alleged Misconduct by Taiwan Sugar Corporation; Bureau of Social Affairs Expresses Opinion; Believes it Arose from Dissatisfaction with the Allocation System

〔Our Newspaper's Report〕The city police department recently received a confidential report alleging misconduct in the allocation of sugar by the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. Director Wu of the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Taiwan Sugar Corporation have also received the mimeographed report. According to Director Wu, the report may have been initiated by sugar merchants from other areas who are dissatisfied with the current allocation system. Regarding the claim in the report that most of the city's 600+ sugar shops are fictitious, the Bureau of Social Affairs stated that, according to commercial registration laws, application procedures are not strictly restricted and only require three main conditions: an address, a business number, and a person in charge. Later, because sugar merchants saw the high profits and many applied for registration, the Bureau of Social Affairs strictly stipulated that at least two members of the Sugar Business Association must vouch for them, and a license could only be obtained after approval by the association. Before strict control was implemented, there were inevitably fictitious numbers used to profit from sugar speculation, but not as many as rumored.

A Batch of Refugees Returns Home, Arrives in Shanghai; Overseas Chinese Affairs Office Will Provide Assistance to Return to Their Hometowns

〔Our Newspaper's Report〕Fifty-one refugees who lived in Italy before the war and were displaced to other countries due to the war were sent back to China from Milan by the International Refugee Relief Agency and our embassy in Italy and arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday. These refugees are all from Qingtian, Zhejiang. They went to Italy before the war to run small businesses for many years. After the outbreak of the war, they were detained in concentration camps by the Italian government during the Mussolini era in 1940 for four years. Until the Allied forces occupied Italy in 1944, the overseas Chinese were released from the camps. However, most of the overseas Chinese were penniless at this point, with no savings, and wandered until our embassy and the International Refugee Relief Agency found ways to send them back to China. After they arrived in Shanghai yesterday, the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office sent people to take care of them. Some were sent to the New Recruit Training Center on Fusheng Road for temporary accommodation, and some overseas Chinese had some savings and took care of their own meals and accommodation in hotels such as Lanju Taishan. Reporters visited several returned overseas Chinese yesterday. Because they had been away from their homeland for many years, their Chinese language was gradually unfamiliar, but they were extremely fluent in Italian. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Office will now work with the Ministry of Social Affairs and other relevant agencies to find ways to send the refugees back to their hometowns. Those who are confirmed to be poor will be sent back to their hometowns and provided with relief by the government. Those who can afford it themselves will be assisted by local agencies to handle the procedures for sending them back.

Travelers to Taiwan Province Must Have Identification

In order to strengthen the effectiveness of the use of national identification cards, the Taiwan Provincial Government has stipulated that, in addition to requiring outbound people to be responsible for the issuance of ship and plane tickets by shipping companies with national identification cards, non-provincial mobile inbound populations must hold national identification cards from their original residence. Those who have not obtained national identification cards should prepare a household registration transcript issued by the township (district) office of their original residence or a legal pass issued by the county or city government. Otherwise, all hotels or other shops that provide accommodation for people may refuse to accommodate them, and if there are suspicious persons, they will be ordered to be dealt with by local military and police agencies in accordance with the law.

Adjustment of Rickshaw Rental Prices; Before Receiving a Reply from the City Government; Still to be Determined by the Review Committee

〔Our Newspaper's Report〕The Bureau of Social Affairs convened a meeting of the Shanghai Tricycle and Rickshaw Rental Review Committee on January 3rd. It was stipulated that from January 1st to March 31st, 1948, the rickshaw rental should not exceed 34,000 yuan per day, the single tricycle rental should not exceed 60,000 yuan per day, and the double tricycle rental should not exceed 69,000 yuan per day. Since the implementation of this rule, rickshaw merchants have requested that the rental fees be calculated based on the cost of living index to allow for temporary adjustments due to the repeated increase in prices. After the Bureau of Social Affairs submitted this method to the City Government, no reply has been received. With March 31st approaching, how the rental fees will be stipulated from April 1st needs to be discussed urgently. The Bureau of Social Affairs is preparing to proceed as originally planned and convene a rickshaw rental review committee to determine new prices before receiving instructions from the City Government.

Commander of the First Naval Base, Dong Shu, Speaks

〔Our Newspaper's Report〕Fang Nianmai, Commander of the First Naval Base, has retired due to old age. The General Headquarters has appointed Dong Shu, Commander of the Second Naval Base, to succeed him. Mr. Dong came to Shanghai from Qingdao a few days ago to take over. Yesterday (the 19th), he hosted a press conference and said: China's coastline is more than 800 miles long. After the establishment of the Naval General Headquarters last year, in order to strengthen defense, it followed the American system and established four base command headquarters. The First Base is in Shanghai, and its jurisdiction extends from the border between Jiangsu and Shandong provinces to the border between Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. The main tasks of the base command headquarters are repair, supply, coastal patrol, transportation and communications, land guard, and medical services. Because China's navy is still under construction, it is hoped that all parties will provide assistance. The First Base Command Headquarters was previously said to be relocated to the Zhoushan Islands during Commander Fang's tenure. Now, a patrol office has been established in Dinghai, so there are no plans to relocate. As for preventing the Communist bandits from landing by smuggling on the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the base command headquarters has established close ties with the garrison command headquarters and other relevant military and police agencies.

The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee has scheduled a small group meeting at 4:00 PM on the 22nd to invite the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Labor Association, the General Labor Union, the Industrial Association, and the City Chamber of Commerce to discuss the issue of workers in factories claiming grain rations based on the number of household members.

A revolver and nine bullets are confiscated." The civil portion was not mentioned in the judgment. It is heard that Li Zhen said that she was dissatisfied with the judgment and would appeal. Shen Gongwei had been detained in the Sinan Road Detention Center for more than a month during the investigation and trial, and the calculated detention period has exceeded, so there is no need for execution.

A Bird's-Eye View of British Education, by Our Correspondent in Britain, S.B. Geng

In recent years, many systems in Britain have undergone changes. In education, too, the passage of the Education Act 1944 has led to several differences from the past. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief introduction to the current education system in Britain.

We can begin with educational administration.

The Ministry of Education Was Established Not Long Ago; Universities Are Not Under Its Jurisdiction

British schools at all levels originated very early. Some schools, such as Oxford and Cambridge, originated in the 13th century, but most schools were run by private individuals or churches. Therefore, national educational administration, strictly speaking, began with the subsidy system in 1833. In 1839, a committee was established in the Privy Council to manage matters related to education. In 1899, a Board of Education was established to separate educational administration from the Privy Council. The passage of the Education Act 1944 led to the establishment of the Ministry of Education to replace the previous Board of Education. The highest educational administrative body in Britain now is this newly established Ministry of Education. However, one point should be noted: the British Ministry of Education does not have jurisdiction over universities and cannot interfere with them. Furthermore, in principle, it neither directly establishes schools nor interferes with the adoption of textbooks. At the local government level, the County and County Borough are the primary units for handling educational administration. (Note: County and County Borough are the highest-level units in the British local government system. A county is roughly equivalent to a province in our country, and a county borough is roughly equivalent to a municipality directly under the central government in our country.) Each has an education committee and a chief education officer to handle various types of education within its jurisdiction. The appointment of the education officer must be approved by the Minister of Education.

As stipulated in the Act of 1902, the county is mainly responsible for secondary and higher education. Ordinary Boroughs, Urban Districts, and Rural Districts below the county level may also have the power to handle elementary education. This system has both advantages and disadvantages. The Education Act 1944 abolished the educational administrative power of areas below the county level and concentrated it in the county and county borough. However, a new system of "Divisional Executive" was established. This "Divisional Executive" can be divided into two categories. One category is where the county, after consulting with its subordinate units (such as districts), can submit a plan for entrusted execution to the Ministry of Education, that is, dividing the various urban areas in the county into several units and entrusting them with the management of education. The other category can be said to be special, that is, all ordinary boroughs and urban districts with a pre-war population of more than 60,000 and no fewer than 7,000 elementary school students have the right to become a region on their own and formulate other methods. If its population is less than this number but there are special circumstances, it can also request the Ministry of Education to become a region on its own. The powers of these divisional executives are not all the same. Some districts may have all the educational administrative powers conferred by local governments, while others have less power.

Compulsory Education Gradually Promoted; Expanded to Secondary Schools

The current education system, except for the special nature of university education (see below), can be divided into three parts: elementary education, secondary education, and continuation education. The educational administrative power of local governments lies in making various efforts to ensure that the people in their respective regions receive appropriate education. The responsibility of the central Ministry of Education, on the other hand, focuses on supervising the effective management of education by local governments. The age for compulsory education is gradually increased, that is, originally stipulated as five to fourteen years old, and must be increased to fifteen years old before April 1, 1947. If the Minister of Education believes that the various facilities and teachers are sufficient, it will be further increased to sixteen years old. In other words, compulsory education will extend to secondary education, not limited to elementary education. Before the Education Act 1944, public elementary education institutions were not allowed to charge fees, and now secondary schools are also free.

Elementary education refers to various types of education for children under the age of eleven. This education usually includes two parts: one is a kindergarten for children aged two to five, and the other is an elementary school for children aged five and above. Secondary education refers to various types of education for children over the age of eleven. This secondary education is divided into three categories: the first category is the commonly known "Grammar School," which can be divided into several types, namely public, private, and private but subsidized by local or central governments. The Grammar School originated very early; the second category is the "Modern School," which developed from elementary schools and focuses on general training, especially education tailored to students' environment and daily practical life. The third category is the "Technical School," which originated in 1905 and was previously commonly known as a junior technical school, but should now be included in secondary education. This type of school usually takes two or three years to impart students with the knowledge to participate in a certain commercial or industrial profession. Continuation education generally includes two types: one is education for those over the age of compulsory education, and the other is continuation education for employed people. This education includes vocational education, non-vocational education, and so on.

Textbooks Are Freely Adopted; The British Government Does Not Intervene

As mentioned above, we can see that there are three characteristics in the entire British education system: first, although the central government has a Ministry of Education, it does not directly establish schools, but local governments are responsible for its actual implementation. This is an application of a decentralized system. Second, in the local government system, the responsibility of higher-level units is, in principle, more than that of lower-level units. Third, the atmosphere of free development is relatively strong, and the state does not intervene in textbooks and so on.

In addition to the above, two points about British education must be explained. The first is that there is a strong trend of private or group-run schools, and they also occupy an important position in the entire education system. This can be said to originate from the trend of church-run schools. At present, all levels of schools in Britain, except for public schools, are private. Some of these private schools receive government subsidies, while others are completely self-sufficient. Among those receiving government subsidies, there is also a distinction between receiving central government subsidies and local government subsidies. After the Education Act 1944, all private schools, regardless of whether they receive subsidies, must be registered and supervised. However, so-called supervision mostly involves paying attention to whether certain facilities meet standards, rather than interfering with school administration. Second, British universities are "autonomous" organizations and are not under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education. They also receive subsidies from the state, which are directly issued by the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance has a University Grants Committee, which is composed of experts and scholars. The Ministry of Finance provides subsidies based on the opinions of this committee. Some universities also receive subsidies from local governments. The Ministry of Education has established "National Scholarships" in various universities to subsidize students. It is estimated that about 40% to 50% of "full-time" students in British universities (note: "full-time" refers to not holding other jobs; there are also "part-time" students) receive various scholarships. Of course, these scholarships are not entirely from the state; some are from private individuals or private groups. Currently, there are twelve universities in Britain that can award degrees. Before the war, there were about 40,000 "full-time" university students, of which about 22% were female. Universities do not completely provide dormitories; rather, day school is the norm. Each school has its own methods. The situation of University A is different from that of University B. Within the same university, the situation of College A is also often different from that of College B. In general, British schools, especially universities, seem to be the development of the ancient private tutoring system, and therefore have evolved into unique situations that are not similar to each other.

Today's Group A Football Match: Railway Meets Jewish; Mayor's Cup: Donghua vs. Municipal Printing

In addition to the Group A and Group C finals of the football league today, there will also be a total of four matches, including the Mayor's Cup and the Youth Cup, starting at 10:00 AM at both the Chung Cheng Park and ______ football fields. The Mayor's Cup match between Donghua and Municipal Printing will not sell tickets. The Railway vs. Jewish match will be held at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM, and tickets will still be sold for 40,000 to 60,000 yuan, starting at the Municipal Stadium at 1:00 PM. However, due to continuous rainy days and standing water on the football fields, whether today's match can be held depends on the weather. Each team scheduled to play can call 38683 to inquire with the Football Committee.

At 10:00 AM today, in the Mayor's Cup match between Donghua and Municipal Printing, Donghua is the champion of the previous Group A league, with a wealth of talent. Although Sun Jinshun's leg injury has not yet healed, they should be able to easily defeat the mediocre Municipal Printing team and announce their promotion. Municipal Printing is relatively strong in Group B. Meeting a strong enemy in the Mayor's Cup, knowing that they will inevitably lose, they will strive to play well. They will do their best at that time.

At 3:00 PM, in the Group A match between Railway and Jewish, Railway has been in good condition recently. Under the constant supervision of Chairman Wang Zhaohuai, they have been training diligently. The team's strength has also improved since the beginning of the season due to the careful planning of team captain Wu Binghao. The coordination between the forwards and defenders is tacit, and both offense and defense demonstrate skill. Moreover, all the players are young and capable fighters. In this football season, they are known as the "dark horse." Their fighting power is unpredictable. Jewish is also an old dark horse. Recently, due to the departure of main players Manya, Dasidanen, and Wennuogan, their strength has been greatly affected. After losing to Donghua last week, they have been working hard in training. Meeting Railway today, it is expected that there will be a fierce battle under evenly matched strength. When dark horses meet, it is unknown who will win.

End of Group A Basketball War; Hualian Loses Form, Detracting from the Spectacle; Dagong Fights Hard and Wins; 51 to 45 Overwhelms the Ever-Victorious Army

[Our Newspaper News] In the final match of the Basketball League Group A last night, Dagong "acted quickly and shot accurately" and surprisingly overwhelmed Shanghai's ever-victorious army Hualian with a score of 51 to 45 to win the runner-up. The tension of the game was unprecedented. In the first half, Dagong led by 23 to 21, leading by two points. Although it was raining heavily outside, the gymnasium was still packed with more than 4,000 fans, which shows the enthusiasm. In the Group A2 AB Championship final, Green Forest won over Donghua by one point, benefiting greatly from free throws. In the first half, Green Forest led 15 to 11.

Successes and Failures

Last night, Wu Chengzhang of Hualian played despite his injured waist, which greatly affected the strength of the forwards. Bao Songyuan's close shots supported the situation and was one of the most outstanding members of Hualian last night. Da Li seemed to lack strength, and the "family members" were unable to do what they wanted, while Xue Chong and Xiang Cheng were not weak. Looking back at Dagong, the shots of Zhang Wenhua and Wenlong were excellent, playing very smoothly. Zhongqiang worked hard, and Tu Wenlong waved the ball with one hand. The two were worthy of being old partners, and Tongke's housekeeping skills boosted Dagong's peace of mind. The victory of Dagong in this fierce battle was due to their psychological stability, full-strength offense, and willingness to learn. It was indeed better than usual. However, because the marking was too tight, it was easy to foul, which needs to be paid attention to. It is undeniable that Hualian was inferior to the past. Later, they wanted to attack but could not, falling into depression. The overall situation of the team was abnormal, which was the cause of their defeat. The old referee Shu Hong seemed very polite to both sides because of his guest appearance with the Green Forest because of his connections.

Dagong Leads

In the Hualian vs. Dagong game, Hualian's lineup included Zhenzhong, Songyuan, Xue Chong, Fu Shan, and Xiang Cheng, while Dagong's lineup included Wenhua, Wenzhang, Wenlong, Zhongqiang, and Lianke. The game started at 7:23. Wenlong fouled, and Songyuan missed. Wenlong made a free throw to record for Dagong. Zhongqiang added two points with a long shot, making it 3 to 0. Hualian called a timeout. Five minutes later, Hualian scored one point from Songyuan's free throw. Zhongqiang shot accurately, and Wenhua made a free throw, making it 6 to 1.

### The Central China Pacification Conference Successfully Concludes; Overall War Plan Approved by the Assembly; Chairman Chiang Delivers Instructions Emphasizing Thorough Implementation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] The Central China Pacification Conference, attended by the governors of eight provinces, the commanders of various pacification zones in Central China, and relevant government leaders, concluded successfully at 7 PM on the 20th after four consecutive days of meetings. Chairman Chiang personally attended the closing ceremony and delivered instructions, urging the participating governors and pacification zone commanders to thoroughly implement the overall war plan for Central China as approved by the assembly. He emphasized that military, political, and economic efforts should be effectively coordinated to rectify past shortcomings in military and political affairs. When implementing the overall war plan, all available forces should be mobilized and devoted to the task, while also ensuring that close ties are maintained with the populace and that they are not harassed. The Chairman's address lasted for ten minutes, during which he provided concrete instructions for strengthening future pacification efforts. At 8 PM, the Chairman hosted a banquet for all attendees.

Today's pacification conference consisted of a comprehensive review session in the morning and a plenary session in the afternoon, both presided over by Bai Chongxi. The overall war plan for Central China, which had been under discussion for several days, was formally approved at the plenary session on the afternoon of the 20th. Key points are as follows: (1) Adjustments will be made to the organization of pacification zones. The Wuhan Provisional Headquarters will be abolished, and a Central China Pacification Headquarters will be established instead. The Pacification Director will have full authority over military, political, and other affairs in the region. The military will be directly under the command of the highest authority, and the political affairs will be directly under the command of the Executive Yuan. The commanders of the various pacification zones under the Pacification Headquarters will also be fully responsible for military and political affairs within their respective zones. However, their political authority will be derived from the provincial governments. The provincial governments within the pacification zones will be solely responsible for administrative matters. The military structure of the Army Headquarters stationed in Xuzhou, commanding the four provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, will remain unchanged. However, a Political Affairs Committee will be established within the Army Headquarters to handle political matters related to bandit suppression in the four provinces under its jurisdiction. (2) Members of the Political Affairs Committee will be appointed by the government upon the recommendation of the chairman. Pacification zone commanders will have the authority to recommend administrative inspectors for their respective zones, who will be appointed by the provincial government and supervised by the pacification zone commander. (3) Funding for provincial self-defense forces will be provided by the central government. Counties will also establish security teams or security regiments, funded by local sources. (4) To prevent resources in the pacification zones from falling into enemy hands, pacification zone commanders are authorized to control resources in their zones. The government may purchase resources from bandit-controlled areas for the pacification zones. (5) A survey of grain reserves among the people in the pacification zones will be conducted, stipulating that people may retain enough grain for three or six months, with the remainder to be purchased by the government. (6) The system of land distribution to soldiers will be implemented, with a general principle of allocating three to five mu of land to each soldier. Detailed implementation measures will be decided upon through further consultations between the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Land Administration. Regarding revisions to the regulations on land management in pacification zones, the review session decided that land in pacification zones not cultivated by the owner, regardless of whether it was illegally distributed by the communists or not, would be permitted to be retained by the family up to a limit of five mu per person. Any amount exceeding this limit would be acquired by the government and compensated with land-backed bonds, redeemable within fifteen years. The land would then become the property of the owner-cultivator. However, this was only approved in principle at the plenary session on the 20th, and the implementation measures were left to the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Land Administration for further detailed study, to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for decision and to complete the legislative process.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] Heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan will host a joint luncheon on the 21st for the governors of various provinces attending the pacification conference in Nanjing.
