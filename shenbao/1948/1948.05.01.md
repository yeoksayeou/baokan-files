### National Assembly Cables the Entire Country: Unanimous Mobilization to Intensify Suppression of the Rebellion; Passes the Establishment of a Constitutional Supervision Committee

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The First Session of the First National Assembly, on the 30th, cabled the entire country on the total mobilization to suppress the rebellion. The full text is as follows:

To all compatriots across the nation and those residing overseas: The Communist Party disregards the nation and betrays the people, raising arms in rebellion with no intention of repentance. They embody the worst of roving bandits and excel in murder and looting. The people are plunged into misery, living in fire and water. Their crimes are too numerous to count. To swiftly eliminate the rebellious flames and save the country and its people, the government should strengthen the front lines and intensify suppression. Our compatriots at home and abroad should strive to rise, overcome the difficulties together, and promote the spirit of military-civilian cooperation, with mobilization to suppress the rebellion as the top priority. We, by the unanimous resolution of the entire assembly, wish that our compatriots at home and abroad remember the difficulty in creating the nation and the immense suffering of the people. Let us pool our wisdom and efforts and mobilize together to remove obstacles to democracy and establish a permanent foundation for the nation. The country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate. National Assembly, April 30th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The First Session of the First National Assembly, after five weeks of meetings and the election of the President and Vice President, is approaching its conclusion. The sixteenth session was held on the morning of the 30th, which was also the final session of this meeting. It passed a resolution to establish a Constitutional Supervision Committee, following the precedent of establishing a Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee after the Constituent National Assembly. Representatives can freely participate in this committee, which will study the Constitution, supervise its implementation, and serve as a regular liaison. With this, all the agenda items of this meeting have been completed and will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion on the morning of May 1st.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] Representatives of this National Assembly will serve as members of the Mobilization Committee for Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction after the meeting. Secretary-General of the Assembly, Hong Lanyou, has sent letters to all representatives. The original letter stated: "Respectfully informing you: We have recently received a letter from Wu Wenguan, Secretary-General of the National Government (dated the 29th), stating that he was instructed by the Chairman: 'After the closing of the First Session of the National Assembly, the government plans to initially invite representatives to serve as members of the Mobilization Committee for Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction.' We are hereby conveying this message for your information."

### Discussion Situation of the Last Session of the National Assembly

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The sixteenth session of the National Assembly was held at 9:40 AM on the 30th, chaired by Pan Gongzhan from the second group of the presidium. After the presidium reported on the National Assembly's cable to the entire country on the general mobilization to suppress the rebellion and the closing ceremony on May 1st, it proceeded to discuss the seventh report of the First Review Committee regarding the establishment of institutions after the meeting. The original review opinion was to establish a Constitutional Assessment Committee and a Constitutional Research Committee, with the participation of all representatives. Subsequently, the presidium received a motion from Yuan Shuren and 138 others, proposing an amendment to the review report, advocating the establishment of a Constitutional Supervision Committee, with the headquarters in the capital and branches optionally established in various provinces and cities. The committee members would be unpaid. The presidium also presented two opinions on the results of the study of the review report and the amendment: (1) Organize a Constitutional Research Committee, following the procedures of the National Economic Research Committee, with each representative-producing unit recommending one person, and the presidium recommending 50 representatives who have a deep understanding of the Constitution. (2) Members of the Constitutional Research Committee and the National Economic Research Committee are all unpaid. The above three opinions were combined for discussion.

As a result, Chairman Pan Gongzhan announced the cessation of discussion and summarized the opinions of the representatives into two points, which were put to a vote: (1) Establish an institution following the precedent of establishing a Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee after the Constituent National Assembly, with the free participation of all representatives. (2) The name should be either the Constitutional Research Committee or the Constitutional Supervision Committee. At that time, there were only 980 representatives present. After using the voting machine three times, it was passed to establish a Constitutional Supervision Committee after this meeting, following the precedent of establishing a Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee after the Constituent National Assembly, with the free participation of all representatives. The meeting adjourned at 12:15 PM.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the Thirtieth] The National Assembly Presidium held its forty-second meeting at 8:00 PM on the 30th, chaired by Qian Dajun, to discuss the method of nominating members of the National Economic Research Committee.

### Military Institutions to be Reformed

The Pacification Headquarters May Be Renamed the Presidential Northern Headquarters

[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 30th] The reform of the central military institutions is under discussion. According to qualified sources, establishing a new institution to unify the command of the army, navy, and air force, and to strengthen the suppression of the rebellion, has become a unanimous hope. However, the name of the new institution under discussion may not be "Military Commission."

[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 30th] China News Agency reports: Wu Qiwai, Deputy Director of the Pacification Headquarters, said that the Pacification Headquarters would not be abolished after the implementation of the Constitution, and its powers would be expanded and its ranks strengthened. As for the name, it may be changed to the Presidential Northern Headquarters.

### Sun Ke Establishes the National Reconstruction Association; Officially Established in Nanjing Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, Dispatch of the 30th] In order to unite progressive elements in the country to assist in the great cause of national reconstruction, Vice Chairman Sun initiated the establishment of the National Reconstruction Association. The inaugural meeting was held at 6:00 PM on the 30th at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center, attended by more than a thousand National Assembly representatives and like-minded individuals. Mr. Sun announced the purpose of initiating the organization of the association. The National Assembly representatives present unanimously and enthusiastically approved it. In addition to passing the association's constitution item by item, they unanimously elected Mr. Sun as the president. Due to the urgency of time, the selection of the association's interim directors, supervisors, and councilors was scheduled to be done by each unit separately on the 1st, and then formal establishment of branches in various provinces and cities would be conducted. After the organization of branches in various regions is completed, a representative meeting will be held to elect formal directors, supervisors, and councilors. The purpose of the National Reconstruction Association is roughly stated as follows: With the opening of the National Assembly and the commencement of constitutional government, Chinese politics has entered a new era. This is truly the pivotal moment for the nation's fortunes and the people's livelihoods. We, after the hardships of the past, cannot but grasp this once-in-a-millennium opportunity with the utmost seriousness to achieve the completion of the great cause of constitutional government and the realization of the Three Principles of the People. In this critical situation, we believe that the current political tasks are still nothing more than suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. Without suppressing the rebellion, it is impossible to guarantee the completion of national reconstruction, and without national reconstruction, it is impossible to strengthen the power to suppress the rebellion. Among the two, national reconstruction is the key to solving national affairs. To ensure the smooth progress of national reconstruction, political reform is essential. Recently, throughout the country, the calls for political reform have been surging like a storm. All the resolutions of the National Assembly and the appeals of public opinion everywhere take this as their goal. To achieve this goal, empty words alone cannot be effective, and collective power must be transformed into organized action. Cognizant of the difficulties of the times and feeling the weight of responsibility, we have specially gathered insightful people from all over the country to initiate the organization of the National Reconstruction Association in the capital and plan to establish branches in various places at home and abroad, in order to summon the people of the country to pool their wisdom and efforts and move towards the overall goal of building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. However, the great cause of national reconstruction involves myriad aspects, and innovation is not the task of a single individual. Fortunately, we have received the support of domestic talents who agree with this purpose and enthusiastically participate, which will not only be the good fortune of our colleagues, but also the benefit of the nation.

### National Assembly Decides to Send Representatives to Present Certificates of Election to the President and Vice President; Wu Jingheng Chosen to Administer the Oath at the Inauguration Ceremony

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] Regarding the presentation of the certificates of election to the President and Vice President, the National Assembly Presidium made a new decision on the 30th, deciding not to hold a presentation ceremony. Instead, the Presidium will appoint Zhou Zhongyue and the Secretary-General of the Assembly to represent the Assembly and deliver the certificate of election to the President's official residence at 9:00 AM on the 2nd. Yu Bin and the Deputy Secretary-General of the Assembly will simultaneously deliver the certificate of election to the Vice President's official residence. The presentation ceremony planned by the Presidium on the evening of the 29th was presented to the Assembly for reporting on the morning of the 30th. Chairman Pan Gongzhan immediately announced that the Presidium intended to conduct further research on this presentation ceremony based on the general practice of various countries and would not make a decision for the time being. During the recess, the Presidium held a meeting and decided not to hold a ceremony. Hong Lanyou then made a report before the adjournment, stating that the Presidium had made a new decision regarding the method of presenting the certificates of election to the President and Vice President on the spot. According to the general practice of various countries, they are all sent by representatives without holding a separate ceremony. Chairman Pan Gongzhan sought the Assembly's opinion, and with no objections, it was passed. As for the President and Vice President's inauguration ceremony, Wu Jingheng was chosen to administer the oath, and this was also presented to the Assembly for reporting on the 30th and passed without objection.

It is also learned that the certificates of election for the President and Vice President were signed and sealed by the National Assembly Presidium on the evening of the 30th. The cover and back of the certificate of election are both made of brocade, the front cover is red satin stamped with gold, and the signature page is ivory-colored rice paper, totaling six pages, each page is one foot four inches long and eight inches wide. The first two pages are the main text, written in regular script by Ye Yi, Secretary of the Assembly, which is extremely beautiful.

### Remarks by an Authoritative Source: The Legislative Yuan Should Convene as Soon as Possible to Allow the New Government to Smoothly Implement Political Affairs; The Date of the President's Inauguration is No Later Than the 20th

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] After the closing of the National Assembly, the date on which the President and Vice President will take office has not yet been determined. On the 30th, the reporter visited an authoritative political figure and asked about both legal and factual aspects. The response was: "According to Article 7 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, 'The first President and Vice President shall take office within 20 days after being elected.' There are two interpretations of 'elected': (1) According to Article 4, Paragraph 3 of the same law, 'Those who receive more than half of the total number of votes of the representatives shall be elected.' The President was elected on April 19th, and the latest date for his inauguration is May 9th. The Vice President should take office at the same time as the President; (2) The President was elected on April 19th, and the Vice President was elected on April 29th, and the time when the elected person actually knows that he has been elected should be when he receives the certificate of election, and the Assembly has scheduled to send the certificate of election on May 1st. If this interpretation is followed, then the latest date for the inauguration is May 20th. However, regardless of how it is interpreted, the President and Vice President's inauguration period, as early as before the 8th, and no later than the 20th, can comply with the specific provisions of the Election and Recall Law. Therefore, the preparatory work before the inauguration must be accelerated. After the President takes office, the constitutional government will be established, and orders can be issued to implement political affairs. According to Article 37 of the Constitution, 'The President shall promulgate laws and issue orders in accordance with the law, and must be countersigned by the Premier of the Executive Yuan or the Premier of the Executive Yuan and the heads of relevant ministries,' so after the President takes office, the Executive Yuan must be organized immediately in accordance with the law so that there is legal countersignature to implement political affairs. This is the most important issue in the Constitution. According to the Constitution, the Premier of the Executive Yuan must be appointed with the consent of the Legislative Yuan, so the Legislative Yuan must convene before the Executive Yuan is organized. According to Article 6 of the Preparatory Procedures for Constitutional Implementation, the first Legislative Yuan shall convene itself on the seventh day after the closing of the National Assembly. Now that the National Assembly will close on the 1st, the Legislative Yuan should convene before the 8th. However, there are still problems with the election of legislators, and the list of those elected has not yet been announced, so the elected legislators have no way to report and convene. The government should pay special attention to this issue, but this is not an extremely difficult problem, because Article 8 of the Legislative Yuan Organic Law stipulates that 'Meetings of the Legislative Yuan may not be convened without the attendance of one-third of the total number of legislators,' so it seems very easy to notify and convene a meeting. From the current situation, the issue of legislators should not be delayed any longer. The government should promptly announce the list of elected legislators in accordance with the law, so that one-third or more of the legislators convene as soon as possible to agree on the candidate for the Premier of the Executive Yuan, so that the new Executive Yuan can be established quickly, and the President can smoothly implement political affairs after taking office.

After Li Zongren was elected Vice President, he and his wife visited Chairman Chiang and his wife on the 29th to discuss the situation. (Photographed by the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan)

### Government Committee Prepares for Handover; Premier Zhang May Be Re-elected

[Another Dispatch] The National Government Committee is scheduled to hold its last State Council meeting on the 4th to handle all pending cases, complete all administrative matters, and transfer them to the Presidential Palace. As for the candidate for the new Premier of the Executive Yuan, it is rumored that Zhang Chun will still be appointed in order to ensure familiarity with the job. However, this still requires the approval of the new Legislative Yuan. Mr. Zhang has now been ordered to prepare and has been consulting with various parties in recent days. The Executive Yuan is scheduled to hold temporary meetings on the 1st and 3rd to discuss various important cases in preparation for the handover. According to an authoritative source, the first thing the new Executive Yuan will do after its establishment will be the use of American loans. Of the more than 4.7 billion US dollars of US aid, apart from the portion used for military affairs, the remainder will be used primarily for production.

### Executive Yuan Passes Supplementary Military Expenditure Bill

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The Executive Yuan held its 53rd meeting on the morning of the 30th, chaired by Zhang Qun. After military and diplomatic reports, the following important military cases were discussed: (1) A total of 14 trillion yuan in supplementary expenses for various military expenses in the first half of this year was approved. (2) The case of military rations for 500,000 troops outside the quota was decided to be discussed further after consultation between the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Food. (3) A supplementary bill for new recruits' clothing expenses was resolved; in addition to the 400,000 sets already added, another 300,000 sets will be produced. (4) A supplementary bill for the second phase of conscription expenses for this year, totaling 23.6 billion yuan, was approved. (5) The supplementary bill for the first traffic police headquarters of the Ministry of Communications for recruiting new recruits in the 36th year was resolved and approved, with an additional 1.4 billion yuan, which was changed to a special budget for supplementary expenditures in the 37th year. (6) A supplementary budget of 150 billion yuan for the Ministry of National Defense's intelligence agency was a special supplementary budget. (7) The Ministry of National Defense decided to resolve the Taiwan exchange rate difference and approve the salaries of officers and soldiers stationed in Taiwan in October of last year, resolving to allocate 52 billion yuan to supplement the Taiwan exchange rate difference. (8) The supplementary bill for the construction of barracks in Northeast China was resolved: it is proposed to approve an additional 55 billion yuan for the actual number of households.

### Qingshuihe County Town Recovered

### Over 20,000 Bandits Heavily Besieged in the Area Between Yidu and Linzi in Lu; National Army in Northern Jiangsu Launches Extensive Suppression

[Our Jinan Dispatch of the 30th] The center of gravity of the battle in central Shandong has shifted to Yidu. Over 20,000 bandits in the area between Yidu and Linzi have been heavily besieged by the National Army. The National Army, with the coordination of land artillery and air force, is gradually shrinking the encirclement in order to wipe them out in one fell swoop. Although ChangLe has been besieged by bandits for 29 days and nights, the city walls still stand firm. In Wei County, the core position of the East City customs is still stubbornly defended by the National Army. Although the bandits shelled the area a dozen times on the morning of the 30th, the fortifications are strong, and the National Army is still able to defend stubbornly, waiting for the National Army advancing from the east to relieve the siege.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch of the 30th] The National Army's suppression forces in northern Jiangsu have launched extensive sweeps in recent days. The National Army completely defeated over 2,000 bandits in the Fanchuan Xiaoji area northwest of Tai County, killing over a hundred bandits, capturing over fifty, and seizing two machine guns and a hundred rifles. Another unit of the National Army defeated the LianDong Middle Detachment and Shanshan Guerrilla Company of the bandits near Lianshui and Jingjiang yesterday.

[Our Nanti Dispatch of the 30th] After repeated searches and suppressions, the main force of the bandit army in the Liangtai Pacification Area has been defeated. Over 2,000 bandits in JiangJiaZhuang northwest of Tai County fought fiercely with the security regiment and local self-defense forces yesterday. By 7:00 PM, the bandits were unable to withstand and fled. In this battle, Battalion Commander Liu Yunbiao bravely commanded the battle and was wounded in the leg.

[Our Qingdao Dispatch of the 30th] After the National Army defeated over 3,000 bandits who invaded Weishanwei yesterday, they tracked and pursued them to the northeast. At noon on the 30th, they recovered Dianji Town, and the remnants fled towards Jinkou.

### Major Battle North of the Wei River Nears Its End; National Army Recovers Lin You Yesterday; Several Senior Officers of the Peng Bandit Army Captured

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The four columns of bandit troops dispatched from northern Shaanxi were personally led by Peng Dehuai. Because of the famine in northern Shaanxi this spring, they went out to wander around. It is recently learned that several senior officers of Peng's troops have been captured by the National Army and will be escorted to Nanjing within days.

[Our Intense Xi'an Dispatch of the 30th] The National Army recovered Lin You at 6:00 PM on the 30th. A military spokesman said: The major battle north of the Wei River is nearing its end. The county towns between the Jing and Wei Rivers have now all been recovered. The reasons for the victory are: (1) A change in strategy, not stubbornly defending Yan'an and Baoji, striving for the initiative. (2) High morale, retaliating for the Battle of Yichuan. (3) The various units and services cooperated in combat and worked together.

[Our Xi'an Dispatch of the 30th] The Political Affairs Department of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters issued a battle report at 1:00 PM on the 30th, stating that the National Army had won an even greater victory in Changning Town (east of Yongshou) and Cuimu Town, completely annihilating the pseudo-cavalry Sixth Division. The pseudo-commander Wu Jingduo (i.e., Hu Jingyi's younger brother) was seriously injured and his life is in danger. The battle began on the 28th and ended completely at 8:00 PM on the evening of the 29th. The bandits suffered over 20,000 casualties, and the seized spoils are being inventoried in detail. These bandits attempted to cross the Jing River eastward to escape towards Chunhua and Yiyi on the afternoon of the 29th, but were decisively attacked and annihilated by our 82nd Cavalry Division stationed in Bin County and our troops stationed in Yongshou.

[Our Xi'an Dispatch of the Thirtieth] A senior spokesman for the relevant parties told our reporter at noon on the 30th in the most optimistic words: The great annihilation battle near Eryang is underway. The three columns of bandits, the first, second, and fourth, are like fish in a net, and a decisive victory can be expected soon. It was also stated that the bandits crossed the Jing River south from Bin County last week and briefly occupied a corner of Changwu, Bin County, Yongshou, and Qian County on the West (Xi'an) Guan (Zhou) Highway, then fled to Lin You and a corner of Fengxiang, Qishan, Fufeng, and Wugong at the western end of the Longhai Railway. The Baoji garrison once made a strategic retreat to the south bank of the Wei River, shattering the bandits' plan to cross south. Reinforcements arrived in time from the Luo River area and the east side of the railway, joining forces with the southward troops from eastern Longdong, first defeating the bandits' Sixth Column on the Xilan Highway, and then joining forces with the Baoji garrison crossing the Wei River north to capture the counties along the railway line. The remnants fled to Xianyang and were surrounded by our troops and are being annihilated. In addition, a large army of ours is gathered south of Baoji, so the bandits will definitely have difficulty fleeing south into Sichuan.

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch of the 30th] Over 20,000 bandits were annihilated in the Binzhou victory. There are no bandits north of the western section of the Longhai Railway. They are still being pursued and suppressed by separate routes. There are only small groups of bandits wandering in Gansu, including Lingtai, Ning County, Zhengning Qingyang, etc., all of whom have been repelled. Currently, the southeast of Gansu, including Tianshui, Pingquan, and Liangfeng Town, etc., have announced temporary martial law, concentrating forces under the command of the local garrison commander, and implementing a scorched earth policy to prevent bandits from fleeing.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an Dispatch of the 30th] Personnel from various agencies in Yan'an arrived in Pucheng at noon on the 29th after evacuating with the National Army and will arrive in Xi'an within days.

### Record of the National Assembly: Singing the Third Verse of Yangguan

[Special Report from this Newspaper] The first session of the first National Assembly under the Constitution occupied the entire spring in the capital. From the opening day, the preparatory meeting was handled, followed by the revision of laws, the election of the president, and the discussion of proposals. One event after another, like spring flowers, bloomed and faded. Until today, the issue of permanent institutions, like a late-blooming crabapple, is causing leaves and branches to wither as news of summer approaches. The sixteenth session on the 30th was the last session, with discussions on the final proposal. The performance was constantly filled with a hesitant desire to speak, and a lingering attachment to passing the proposal. But no matter how reluctant people were emotionally, the third verse of Yangguan has already been sung. After tomorrow's closing ceremony, those who came from the people will return to the people.

Before nine o'clock in the morning, the delegates arrived one after another, and the area in front of the assembly hall was bustling with activity. The photographers guarded the entrance, looking up. Ms. Guo Dejie, wife of Li Zongren, smiled and warmly shook hands with each delegate, using her strained and hoarse voice to express her gratitude repeatedly, thanking each delegate for their support of Li Zongren's candidacy. The corridor lacked the tension and excitement of previous election meetings. Publicity materials and newspapers were no longer distributed everywhere. The crowd hurried into the meeting hall, but had barely sat down before they ran off again. The walls of the lounge were covered with sample photos from the photography team, and the delegates admired them, choosing numbers to prepare for additional prints. The work of returning the election certificates was being carried out in the lounge, and groups of delegates were chatting and saying goodbye while sipping tea. It was truly a scene of farewell, with a hint of sadness mixed in with the hustle and bustle.

The meeting hall was holding a meeting to discuss the issue of permanent institutions. The majority of delegates advocated for the establishment of a necessary institution, calling for everyone to be responsible for supervising the government and researching the Constitution. Some said: "Permanent institutions are for fulfilling obligations, while members of the Suppression of Communist Rebellion Committee are officials. We don't want to be officials, we want to represent the people and do things, exercising political power." Some said: "We want to establish permanent institutions. The results of our investigation and research should not only be provided to the next temporary congress for reference, but also submitted to the government for attention at any time." Someone reported to the presidium about research opinions on limiting the number of people in the organization of permanent institutions, and strongly criticized: "The presidium's opinion is to cater to the government's use, forgetting to speak for the people."

Someone shouted loudly: "Delegates! The opportunity for this final meeting is fleeting. We are entrusted by the people. The people don't want us to be delegates who do nothing for six years. Without permanent institutions, what will we rely on to represent the people after the meeting adjourns? How can we face our elders and fellow villagers? How can we face our elders and fellow villagers!"

The meeting hall was full of speeches advocating the establishment of permanent institutions. Everyone emphasized representing the people in exercising political power, doing work, taking responsibility, not enjoying rights, and not wanting money. Even more emphasized that this institution should be located within the assembly hall and participated in by all delegates. The purpose was very obvious: everyone was coveting the powers of the Legislative Yuan, but no one dared to express opposing theories. Only Zhang Qiping submitted a written opinion, saying that the powers of the National Assembly, according to the Constitution, should not establish any permanent institutions. The National Assembly under the Constitution must not violate the Constitution at the very beginning. However, this opposing opinion received no response after being read by the Secretary-General. What followed was still "establishment," "establishment," "must establish," one insightful opinion after another, until 11:53, when the people who supported it became impatient with listening. They clamored from all directions, shouting: "Chairman! Vote!" So Chairman Pan publicly displayed the revised opinions of the review report, summarized into three points: the first was Jia Guoen's proposal to add the words "refer to the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association;" the second was Gu Yuxiu's proposal to change the name of the institution to "Research and Discussion" to avoid others feeling that the word "supervision" was terrible; and the third was Dai Tianqiu's proposal that delegates freely participate in the permanent institutions. However, before the vote, someone raised the issue of numbers. From the more than two thousand people at the beginning of the meeting, only a little more than nine hundred remained midway. Fortunately, according to the rules of procedure, this did not affect the quorum. Chairman Pan calmly maintained order in the meeting hall and proceeded with the vote. The delegates pressed the last button, and the voting machine displayed the last light. Except for the word "supervision," which people were afraid of, everything was passed according to the revised opinions.

In the sound of adjournment, many people laughed victoriously. The National Assembly has a permanent institution. (April 30, in Nanjing)

Editorial

### Commemorating Labor Day

Today is "May 1" Labor Day, the 63rd Labor Day commemoration since 1886. The Chinese people have a spirit of diligence, and the Chinese national spirit is based on hard work as the foundation of the country. Therefore, Labor Day is of particular significance in our country.

The use of "May 1" to commemorate Labor Day is to remember the day of bloody struggle by European and American workers after the Industrial Revolution. Later, international workers used this day as a goal, demanding that all workers around the world unite, organize, and strive for survival, bearing the mission of social evolution. Social evolution is what humanity demands, and the social evolution movement is a movement to strive for human life. The essence of this movement is sacred and should be promoted and developed. However, the Communist Party's concept of social evolution is different from the concept of general social activists. The Communist Party believes that social evolution must go through class struggle and bloodshed. Therefore, for half a century, the international Communist Party has used the solemn "May 1" to paint the blood of the working class. The Communist Party uses the blood and heads of workers to test its erroneous theories, while it is unwilling to shed blood itself, and even sacrifices or abandons the labor front halfway. The history of the past half century tells people: international labor is a peaceful and evolving social movement, not a violent movement that uses class struggle and bloody rebellion as its means. In recent times, the many achievements of the International Labor Conference, as well as the brilliant performance of the British Labour Party's labor policies, have proven the misperceptions of the international Communist Party. The theory of class struggle has been abandoned by the times.

Today's ideology is that the era of Marxism has passed, and democratic and free socialism has arrived. The Chinese people believe in the Three Principles of the People. The spirit of the era of the Three Principles of the People is to establish a democratic and free country of the people, by the people, and for the people. The Principle of People's Livelihood of the Three Principles of the People is a socialism of the new era, a kind of era ideology that is suitable for the national spirit of our country. The economics of the Principle of People's Livelihood focuses on nourishing life, so that the elderly are provided for, the strong are employed, the young are educated, everyone has a job, and everyone has food to eat. Because everyone has a job, everyone must work. Everyone works, so there is no shortage of life. Everyone works, so there is a guarantee of the right to survival. This is the highest standard of peaceful human life, which does not require bloodshed to obtain, nor violence to struggle. A progressive socialist opposes class struggle, a progressive social movement denies bloody struggle and the destruction of happiness and well-being, and a progressive labor policy avoids the use of violent methods. Marxism has hindered social evolution and will inevitably be abandoned by the times. The erroneous path taken by the international Communist Party has become a historical ruin, and is also abandoned by the times. All of humanity in the world, all the workers in the world, today solemnly commemorate this great holiday, and must clearly recognize this point.

The Chinese nation is the most hardworking nation in the world. Working at sunrise and resting at sunset is a manifestation of the spirit of diligence for thousands of years. Due to the poverty of China's social economy, the hardworking masses are still mostly trapped on the verge of starvation. Therefore, China's social policy must be combined with an economic policy that focuses on nourishing the people, to create a progressive, happy, and prosperous society. This happy and prosperous society should not only achieve a comfortable life, but also move towards the realm of great harmony. The highest ideal of the Father of the Nation and the policies of the Three Principles of the People are aimed at this goal. The newly promulgated Constitution last year stipulates in Chapter 13, Basic National Policies, that "The State shall provide appropriate job opportunities to those who are capable of working" (Article 152). This explains that everyone has the right to work and everyone can serve the country through labor. After everyone obtains labor, "The State, in order to improve the lives of workers and farmers and enhance their productive skills, shall enact laws to protect workers and farmers and implement policies to protect workers and farmers" (Article 153). This stipulates that the policy of protecting labor should be promoted with the force of law, so that everyone does not feel deficient or insecure after obtaining labor, and special attention should be paid to the health and safety of women and children in labor. Therefore, Article 153, paragraph 2, stipulates: "Women and children who are willing to engage in labor shall be given special protection according to their age and physical condition." Regarding the improvement of labor life and the relationship between labor and capital, it is further stipulated that "Labor and capital shall develop production enterprises based on the principle of coordination and cooperation. The mediation and arbitration of labor disputes shall be determined by law" (Article 154). This is a progressive social policy, using labor-capital cooperation to develop production, and using democratic compromise through mediation and arbitration to eliminate any labor-capital disputes.

The spirit of the new Constitution is great. It is hoped that the government after the implementation of the Constitution will formulate various laws and promote various policies based on this noble standard.

### Japan's Establishment of a Maritime Security Agency is a Warning Sign of Rebuilding Armed Forces

All Sectors in Shanghai Attach Great Importance to It

[Report from the Central News Agency in This City] All parties here attach great importance to the Japanese government's establishment of a Maritime Security Agency. The reporter consulted several experts on Japanese affairs yesterday, and they unanimously believed that this is a serious warning sign of Japan rebuilding its armed forces. According to Shao Yulin, "Strictly prohibiting Japan from rearming is an important aspect of the Allied control policy over Japan, and the Allied authorities should handle it with special care." Meng Xianzhang believes that this is Japan's preparation for restoring the Ministry of the Navy when the time is ripe, and a further development of the American policy of arming Japan. Fang Qiuwei demanded that countries in the Pacific oppose the American support for the revival of the Japanese navy. Song Yuelun pointed out that less than three years after Japan's surrender, the old institutions still exist. Not only is the Japanese economy about to fully recover, but the entire military system also has the potential to restore its former appearance at any time. Pan Shixian believes that the maritime force that Japan is now planning to organize, with a large fleet of ships as its backbone, has the possibility of transforming into a navy. Zhang Guangya felt strange that countries other than China and the Soviet Union remained silent on this matter. He advocated that the Allied forces should be responsible for controlling smuggling and other illegal activities off the coast of Japan. If the UK and the US object to other countries safeguarding security, another committee to control Japan can be formed, and a control army can be organized to prevent Japan from rebuilding its armed forces.

### Truman to Consult Congress to Implement Aid to China: Washington Expects China to Submit Letter of Agreement

[Report from the Central News Agency in Washington on the 29th] This reporter from the Central News Agency learned today that President Truman will formally consult Congress within the next two weeks to allocate 463 million US dollars to implement the already approved Aid to China program. The US Congress has already approved 338 million US dollars for China's economic recovery, and another 124 million US dollars to be given to China for military or other purposes. Now, it should approve the allocation of the required funds. The White House is currently busy dealing with the House Appropriations Committee's review of the European Recovery Program. Before requesting Congress to allocate funds, it still needs to resolve an important issue of the 125 million US dollar grant portion. The Appropriations Committee is expected to approve the 463 million US dollar Aid to China funds without reduction. Regarding the types and supply of materials for Aid to China, China and the United States have reached a broad agreement. The Economic Cooperation Administration will submit the reasons for allocating funds to the Appropriations Committee, and the Reconstruction Bank has already advanced 50 million US dollars as a start. Once China returns the letter of agreement to the United States, indicating its willingness to sign a bilateral agreement, the shipment of Aid to China materials can begin. Officials in charge of economic aid to China said that it is expected to receive the letter of agreement from China in the short term.

[Report from Nanjing by this Newspaper on the 30th] Regarding the recent letter from American aid personnel to our country expressing their willingness to sign a bilateral agreement to implement the aid plan, it is reported from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that China and the United States are currently preparing to exchange views first, and then negotiate and conclude a bilateral agreement.

### American Government and Private Figures Attach Importance to China's Economic Recovery

Remarks by American Lawyer Alexander Arelman

[Report from this Newspaper] Alexander Arelman, a famous American lawyer in Shanghai, returned to the United States for a matter and attended both the Senate and the House of Representatives to express his views on Aid to China. Arelman flew back to Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 29th). When he met with reporters yesterday, he said: Most Americans hope that China's economy can recover as soon as possible, and the United States is willing to do its best to help. The United States believes that the Aid to China passed in this Congress will enable China to begin its economic recovery work. They hope that this aid can be used for the construction of industry and mining, and not be wasted on passive relief. Given the arduousness of China's recovery work, no one said that the current amount of US loans is sufficient. On the contrary, this is only the beginning. As for whether the United States can lend to China every year in the future, it all depends on how China uses this aid. The more it is used for economic recovery, the greater the possibility of obtaining loans in the future.

### The U.S. Is Currently Considering Supplying Western European Alliance Countries with Limited Quantities of Weapons; The White House Denies This Rumor

[Our Report] New York, 30th Broadcast: Washington News: White House Press Secretary Ross stated that the rumor that the United States will ship a limited number of munitions to the Western European alliance countries is absolutely untrue.

[United Press, Washington, 29th] Well-informed sources here stated that President Truman will submit a special message to Congress next week, requesting that limited quantities of American military equipment, tanks, and aircraft be supplied to the sixteen European countries under the Marshall Plan, including the five countries of the Western European Defense Treaty. According to our agency, President Truman will ask Congress to adopt a limited Lend-Lease Act assistance approach to the armed forces of England, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and [Blank] Luxembourg. The message is still a closely guarded government secret, and its contents are known only to a few top officials. Unless there is a final change, the message will be submitted to Congress on the 3rd or 4th.

[United Press, Washington, 29th] Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference that the plan to transport American military equipment to aid the Western European alliance is under active study, and the heads of the various military departments also stated that they are studying the plan. The White House is accelerating the implementation of this plan, apparently because Congress intends to adjourn around June 15th for the National Political Convention, and not because of any new developments in the international situation. If Congress adjourns on schedule, there will be only six weeks to decide on Truman's request. The government deeply believes that if any delay occurs, the hope of taking action this year will be almost extinguished. It was previously reported that the United States would instruct the European group to prepare a "list" of the materials they need, which is very similar to the submission of lists by various countries in the Marshall Plan. This military equipment aid plan will implement the guarantee provided by Truman on the day the Brussels Pact was signed, that is, Truman's words in Congress that the United States supports the Western European alliance. How Congress will react to the peacetime limited Lend-Lease Act plan is not yet known. Some foreign policy leaders, such as Senator Lodge, have advocated that the implementation of American Lend-Lease aid must establish a European [Blank] Headquarters and appoint a supreme commander for the West. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton disclosed yesterday that the committee recently requested the State Department to prepare a military Lend-Lease Act for non-communist governments. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges has called for increased military aid to the Chinese National Government, and Senator Ball has repeatedly warned that the European Recovery Program is not enough to save Western Europe from world communism.

It is understood that the questions include: (1) the extent of military cooperation that Western European countries can organize among themselves; (2) to ensure the security of Western Europe and resist possible aggression from the East, what level of military assistance do Western European countries need from the United States, including weapons and equipment? The chiefs of the three armed forces of the five Western European countries also participated in today's meeting.

### British Air Force Conference

### Next Session of the Security Council to be Held in Paris

The Soviet Union Opposes Investigating the Czech Coup

[Reuters, Lake Success, 29th] The Security Council held a closed-door meeting today and decided that this session would adjourn on August 21st. The next session will be convened in Paris on September 21st if the international situation permits.

[United Press, Lake Success, 30th] The Soviet Union was originally prepared to use its double veto to thwart the United Nations investigation into the Czech coup last night, but the Security Council adjourned after four hours of heated debate without putting it to a vote, and reconvened this afternoon.

### German Constitutional Assembly

May be Established on September 1st

[Reuters, London, 29th] Observers here believe that the meeting of the six countries of England, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to discuss the German issue will soon reach an agreement stipulating that a German Constitutional Assembly be established before September 1st. Under this plan, the German Constitutional Assembly, based on the instructions of the occupying powers, will draft the constitution for the three zones of West Germany. It is expected that a government under the new West German constitution will be established in early next year. The Constitutional Assembly will be elected by the states of West Germany, with one representative elected for every 750,000 people. After the draft constitution is approved by the military governors of the three zones of West Germany, it will be submitted to a referendum. If approved by a two-thirds majority of the citizens, the constitution can be finally passed. Since the opening of this London meeting, spokespersons for the various delegations have always kept the meeting situation strictly secret, so they have all refused to comment on the aforementioned report. It is generally believed that the plan to establish a West German Constitutional Assembly is a compromise solution to the plan proposed by England and the United States to establish a military government for the three merged zones of England, the United States, and France. However, the extent to which the details of this matter have been agreed upon, or the extent to which it can be accepted by the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, cannot be answered for the time being.

### It is Rumored that the U.S. Will Change its Holy Land Policy; The Situation of the UN is More Difficult; The U.S. Announces That the Trusteeship Plan is Temporary in Nature

[Our Report] New York, 30th Broadcast: Lake Success News: Today, UN President Jiang Tingfu submitted the main points of the United States' proposal for a UN trusteeship in Palestine to the Political Committee. US Representative Jessup pointed out in the committee today that the trusteeship plan is temporary in nature. Indian Representative Biley believes that the shorter the trusteeship period, the better, and said that in order to promote the UN's proposal, it is necessary to organize a UN volunteer army.

[United Press, Lake Success, 30th] The United Nations Special Assembly's debate on the Palestine issue has entered its third week today.

### This Month's Per Capita Rationing of Oil and Rice: Prices Set, Sales Begin Today; Social Affairs Bureau to Discuss Increasing Coal Ball Prices for Rationing to Workers Today

[Our Newspaper] The May per capita rationing of rice and oil in this city will commence sales today and end on the 25th. The quantities and prices for rationing were jointly signed and agreed upon yesterday afternoon at the City Hall during a meeting of three individuals: Ren Xianqun, Director of the Municipal Food Allocation Committee; Pan Guangjiong, representative of the Executive Yuan's American Relief Material Distribution Committee; and Ye Shifu, representative of the Food Department. The decisions are as follows: (1) The types of rice for this month's per capita rationing include eight varieties: American yellow rice, white rice, brown rice, and domestic white japonica, thin indica, indica rice, as well as Burmese and Siamese rice purchased by the government. The rationed quantity has been restored to fifteen *shi jin* (approximately 7.5 kg) per person, a decrease of four percent compared to last month. The rationing price is 350,000 yuan regardless of the rice quality. Citizens can freely choose which type of rice to purchase, and rice retailers are not allowed to mix the varieties. (2) The per capita oil ration is twelve *liang* (approximately 600 g). The price for soybean oil, sesame oil, and vegetable oil is 63,000 yuan, and the price for raw tung oil is 73,000 yuan, including a 3,000 yuan security donation.

[Further News] Regarding the general rationing of coal balls, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau specially invited Ren Xianqun, Director of the Municipal Food Allocation Committee, yesterday to discuss the matter. Director Wu believes that it is difficult to assess the quality standards of coal balls, which could easily lead to abuses. He suggested changing to coal lumps instead, but from the perspective of citizens' usage habits, coal lumps are not as convenient as coal balls. However, Director Wu also stated that whether rationing will occur is still undecided. As for the price of coal balls rationed to industrial workers, the previous period's price was 60,000 yuan per *dan* (approximately 50 kg), with the government subsidizing 200 billion yuan each period. Therefore, it is proposed to raise the price to 150,000 yuan per *dan*. However, the Social Affairs Bureau believes that 150,000 yuan is too high, and Director Wu will convene all parties again today to discuss and determine a reasonable price.

### Principle Agreement on Distributing Cloth to Workers

As for the distribution principles, he does not express opposition.

### Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce Annual Meeting: Praise for Our Foreign Exchange Policy

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce held its 29th annual meeting yesterday. During the meeting, Chairman Ke Xuan delivered a speech, recounting the trade and investment situation of British businesses in China over the past year, and expressing his thoughts on our country's foreign exchange and import/export controls.

Ke believed that the achievements of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund were indeed excellent. If the fund could continue its original policies, regularly publishing exchange rates that are in line with reality, unaffected by political interference, and if the government could control the credit policies of state-owned institutions through the Central Bank, then China's export industry could still be saved in time. However, it should be noted that free enterprise must be encouraged and not obstructed. Regarding remittances, Ke expressed that the most disappointing thing was that remittances for business profits, family expenses, life insurance, and other important items such as commissions on foreign income have still been impossible to remit in the past year. This situation is certainly not enough to encourage foreign investment in China. Ke also stated that the most difficult thing for importers now is the delay in issuing permits and allocating deadlines. However, these two things cannot be blamed on the Import/Export Control Commission (IECC). The reason for the delay is the complete reorganization of policies and regulations and the IECC's slow access to foreign exchange. He welcomed the government's new policy of encouraging the import of raw materials for the manufacture of export products, which is an important trend in liberating international trade from various restrictions. The Chamber has also repeatedly contacted the IECC on various matters and felt that the IECC was very polite to them and receptive to their suggestions.

### Special Criminal Court Tries Dancing Hall Case: Defendants Argue No Political Motivation; Sun Hongyuan and Others to Be Questioned Soon

[Our Newspaper] After the Police Bureau transferred the dancing hall case to the Special Criminal Court for trial, the court secretly tried the case at the end of last month. After a misunderstanding arose on February 1st when dancing hall workers and dancers petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau was vandalized, and the Police Bureau arrested more than 30 people, including Tang Zongjie, Chairman of the Dancing Hall Workers' Union, directors Hu Yunyuan, and dancers Hong Xiaoping, Tan Pei'e, and Feng Aina, who are currently detained at the Huangpu Police Sub-bureau. On the 28th and 29th of last month, judges of the Special Criminal Court issued summonses and brought Tang Zongjie and the other 30 people from the Huangpu Sub-bureau for interrogation. The interrogation was extremely secretive, and defense lawyers were not notified. The judges questioned them one by one, investigating the details of the vandalism of the Social Affairs Bureau in great detail, especially regarding whether there were any treacherous bandits instigating them behind the scenes. All suspects in court claimed that at the time, the Social Affairs Bureau had broken its promise and held the lottery in the morning, causing the workers and dancers to face the risk of unemployment after the closure. Driven by the need to make a living, everyone was agitated after hearing the news, and due to the large number of people, a shout to attack became uncontrollable. However, they all claimed not to have laid a hand on anything. Moreover, the Special Criminal Court specializes in handling bandit cases, and the Police Bureau's investigation of them for three months could not prove that there were Communist bandits instigating them behind the scenes. They were all acting on momentary emotional impulses and had no political motivation. At most, they constituted the crimes of "disturbing order," "obstructing official duties," and "damage," which all fall under the scope of ordinary criminal cases. They requested that the case be transferred to an ordinary court for handling. The judges did not consider this and ordered them to be returned to the Huangpu Sub-bureau for continued trial at a later date. It is reported that the investigation of some of the detained suspects has been completed, and Sun Hongyuan, Chairman of the Dancing Hall Industry Association, and others who are out on bail will be summoned for questioning soon. After the collegial panel concludes the debate, the defendants' lawyers will be allowed to appear in court to defend them, and the trial will be open to the public.

Director of the Telecommunications Bureau Expresses Thoughts

[Our Newspaper] Yu Bingjian, Director of the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, recently expressed his thoughts on telecommunications, stating that since the Second World War, technological advancements have completely transformed telecommunications technology. The holding of the Telecommunications Exhibition can increase people's scientific knowledge. Secondly, the knowledge required to use telecommunications today and the complexity of telecommunications operations make it impossible for the general public to understand. The holding of the exhibition can enable people to understand the breadth of the telecommunications industry today and understand that completing telecommunications construction requires mobilizing enormous human and material resources. At the same time, the future development of the telecommunications industry relies heavily on the cooperation and assistance of the people. Small things such as etiquette when using the telephone and sending telegrams, and large things such as cherishing telecommunications equipment and developing telecommunications manufacturing, are all related to the construction of the telecommunications industry in the future.

Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Shanghai to Upgrade to New Machines

According to Yu Bingjian, Director of the Telecommunications Bureau, in view of the fact that thousands of telegrams are exchanged daily on the Beijing-Shanghai and Tianjin-Shanghai circuits, and the original teletype machines transmit 60 words per minute, in order to improve the efficiency of telecommunications work, it is now planned to adopt the latest six-unit Radiotype teletype machine from the Global Telegraph Company. The machine is equipped with 42 fonts, has only one shift, and has a speed of 160 words per minute, making it extremely convenient to use, saving time and reducing errors. The Bureau has tested it and is satisfied. After the machine is sent to the Telecommunications Exhibition for public display, it will be upgraded on the aforementioned circuits to meet practical needs.

If one film is said to be an allegory for a certain person, then every film or every script has the potential to be an allegory. In the past, unfortunate incidents have occurred with films such as "Fake Phoenix and False Wind," "Where is the King?" and "Su Fengji." If the law believes that this constitutes a possible crime, and therefore cannot make a fair judgment on such unwarranted accusations, then drama and film will be forced to disappear from the world. The spokesperson continued that the progress of the case has not only aroused public outrage from people in the drama and film industries across the country, but also caused international film industry professionals to express shock. For this reason, the Association will make a serious statement.

### Refugees and Unemployed Workers Invite Reporters to Appeal

Please Public Utilities Bureau Issue Tricycle Licenses

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the request of Northern Jiangsu refugees and unemployed workers for licenses for tricycles they have already made, representatives of the petitioners yesterday invited reporters to uphold justice and requested the Public Utilities Bureau to issue licenses to maintain their livelihoods. It is said that there are hundreds of thousands of Northern Jiangsu refugees and unemployed workers in Shanghai, of which about ten thousand were lured by car dealers to pawn and borrow money to jointly purchase more than a thousand tricycles, hoping to make a living by pedaling.

Later, the fifth general meeting of the Municipal Council again resolved that driving in the suburbs would not hinder traffic in the urban area and again requested the municipal government to approve it, but more than a month has passed and the authorities still ignored it, causing the refugees to have no way to survive. Therefore, they are making another appeal.

### Restrictions on Remittances and Cash Transportation, the Gold Control Bureau Recommends Lifting Restrictions, the Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Tianjin Bureaus Have Reached a Consensus

[United Credit Bureau News] Lin Chongyong, Director of the Hankou Gold Control Bureau, and Gao Fang, Director of the Guangzhou Bureau, came to Shanghai one after another a few days ago. They were originally scheduled to go to Beijing together with Li Lixia, Director of the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau, on the 29th. Shi Kuiling, Director of the Tianjin Bureau, also rushed here yesterday. They changed their plans and went to Beijing together by car last night. It is learned that the directors have made informal reviews of the business situation in various places. Regarding control aspects, it was decided to recommend improvements to the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank authorities. The current restrictions on remittance and cash transportation between Shanghai and Guangzhou have lost their meaning, and it is indeed necessary to lift the restrictions. It is reported that the four directors have reached a consensus on this.

[Also News] According to Shi Kuiling, Director of the Tianjin Financial Administration Bureau, the four directors' opinions are purely based on the experience of actual work in recent months. He believes that since the implementation of the restrictions on remittances, the effect has been very small, and it has caused a bad consequence. The business of general Chinese merchants and banks in North China has declined due to this restriction. However, foreign banks are not restricted, and their business has improved. Shi believes that abolishing the restrictions will not affect the control of internal remittances, as banks can use the exchange rate to make appropriate adjustments. He also expressed his views on the handling of the inflow of funds from Northeast China, saying that based on past experience, it has been proven impossible to completely eliminate the entry of funds from Northeast China. Therefore, it is believed that the authorities should start from channeling and disperse it to various places and invest it in production, which can reduce its stimulation to prices. Therefore, he advocates that the government should expand the areas for internal remittances from Northeast China beyond the current open areas of Beiping and Tianjin to areas such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Chengdu, Lanzhou, Shaanxi, Guangzhou, and Xi'an.

### Match Industry Asks for Cancellation of Restrictions on Raw Material Imports

[Our Report] It is reported that the match industry is requesting the authorities to cancel the decision made by the National Economic Conference to prohibit the import of phosphorus and potassium chlorate, raw materials for matches, starting from the seventh quarter. According to the match industry, the current annual demand for phosphorus and potassium chlorate raw materials in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang regions is approximately 1,240 metric tons. If combined with the national calculation, it is feared that this number would increase by four to five times. However, there are very few factories in China that manufacture these raw materials. Although the Changshou China Match Raw Material Factory has production, it is only sufficient for Sichuan Province. As for the Taiwan factory, it can currently only produce about 15 metric tons per month. After one year, it may be possible to increase it to 40 metric tons per month, but it is still far from the required number. Therefore, a sudden stop of imports will inevitably affect match production. The industry has recently submitted a request to the authorities to cancel this decision.

### Sixth Quarter Quota Begins Today

[Our Report] According to sources from the Export Control Committee, the fifth quarter quota ended yesterday (30th). The sixth quarter quota, from May 1st to the end of July, has been announced together with the previous quarter. It only needs to wait for Director Huo's approval to determine the allocation method.

### Interview with Madam Li Qingquan

[Our Report] Madam Li Qingquan, who led the first batch of Philippine athletes to Shanghai yesterday, is already 54 years old, but she still gives people the impression of a middle-aged person. With a rosy face and a strong physique, she did not show any fatigue after seven or eight hours of continuous travel. When reporters visited her, she still spoke eloquently. She said: This is the third time she has come to Shanghai, and she is very excited to set foot on the land of her motherland. She said: In addition to leading the Philippine overseas Chinese female athletes back to the country for observation, she also has some private matters to deal with, so she may stay in Shanghai for a while after the National Games. She is currently the president of the Philippine Overseas Chinese Women's Comfort Association, which was established when the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. It made significant donations to the motherland during the War of Resistance. Her husband, Mr. Li Qingquan, was the chairman of the Philippine Overseas Chinese Anti-Enemy Association, and unfortunately passed away in 1938 due to overwork. Although this was a major blow to her, she has rededicated her entire energy to the Philippine Overseas Chinese community and public welfare undertakings. She now has many children and grandchildren, with six sons, three daughters, and fourteen grandchildren. Everyone says she is a blessed lady.

### Torch Relay Long-Distance Run Delivering Presidential Message to Depart from Beijing Tomorrow Afternoon, Our Newspaper Sends Special Vehicle for On-Site Broadcasting

[Our Report] In order to report in detail the grand event of the Beijing-Shanghai long-distance torch relay delivering the President's message, this newspaper, with the assistance of the Shanghai Branch of the National Amateur Radio Association, is organizing on-site interviews and reports on the passing situation along the way. A special vehicle will be dispatched to Beijing today, equipped with a generator and two amateur radio shortwave transmitters with wavelengths of 20 meters and 40 meters. Liu Wenqu, a special correspondent from our newspaper in Nanjing, will lead the team, accompanied by Wu Guanzhou and Chen Yiming. Zhang Zhifeng, Xu Shijie, Liang Yijian, and Mr. and Mrs. Xu Yujia will be in charge from the amateur radio association. The special vehicle is expected to arrive in Nanjing tonight along the Beijing-Shanghai Highway. It will depart from Nanjing with the athlete team tomorrow afternoon, passing through Tangshan, Tianwang Temple, Yixing, Wuxi, Changshu, Taicang, and returning to Shanghai. Broadcasting will begin along the way after the ceremony of receiving the message. Everything from the athletes' activities to the grand welcome scenes in various places along the way will be selectively extracted and reported in the most vivid and realistic manner, so that audiences across the country can keep abreast of the long-distance relay run. This newspaper has also negotiated with various private radio stations in the city, and they will all broadcast it at that time. Amateur radio stations across the country will also rebroadcast it simultaneously. The torch long-distance relay to deliver the President's message is of great significance and is a characteristic of this National Games. The on-site interview and broadcasting vehicle of this newspaper will follow the route and the things heard and seen will be particularly vivid and rapid. It is expected that it will be welcomed by readers across the country at that time. The interview and broadcasting vehicle used by this newspaper this time is rented from Liangjiang Automobile Company. The responsible authorities of the company are enthusiastic about sports and spare no effort in supporting news reports, and the smooth completion of this newspaper's on-site interview and broadcasting plan along the way is due to the company's efforts.

[Our Report from Suzhou, 30th] The Jiangsu Provincial Government recently issued an order to various counties along the Beijing-Shanghai Highway, such as Yixing, Wuxi, Yushan, and Taicang, to dispatch police officers to assist and provide protection along the way during the relay run to deliver the President's message to the National Games.

### Female Sprint Athlete Qian Hangsu Discusses the Current National Games and Shanghai Athletes

[Our Newspaper Special] Qian Hangsu, a female sprint athlete who made a big splash in the 5th and 6th National Games, is now the mother of four children. However, her interest in sports has not diminished from those years. For more than ten years, she has never left her post and is currently a sports instructor for female students at Jinan University and a coach at the East Asia Institute of Physical Education. This time, the National Games are being held in Shanghai, and Ms. Qian has been appointed as a member of the Shanghai team's selection committee.

When the reporter visited this athlete who once dominated the sports scene yesterday afternoon, Ms. Qian said that she did not dare to be too optimistic about the Shanghai athletes participating in this National Games. She shook her head and said: "The training time is too short. It has been less than half a month from the selection on April 11th to the present, and they can only practice three or four times. Moreover, they usually don't pay attention to it. The interest of various schools in the city in track and field seems to have gradually decreased and turned to ball games, so the hope of winning a medal in this National Games is really very small."

A total of 55 athletes from the city will participate in the competition, including 19 women. All track and field events will be participated in. According to Ms. Qian's observation, the most promising one is Chen Yingzhen from St. John's University in the high jump. The results are not bad during practice and she has jumped to 1.34 meters. In addition, Shi Zonglan of Shanghai No. 1 Girls' High School is also making progress in the low hurdles. Ms. Qian is currently training her to move from five steps to one hurdle to three steps. Last time she practiced, she was able to jump over five hurdles with three steps. If she can pass eight hurdles, she can be expected to score points. According to Ms. Qian's observation, Miss Shi is a very talented athlete, tall, with superhuman strength, and good at both basketball and volleyball. If she is given sufficient training time, it is believed that she will definitely win glory for the city. In addition, Ma Shenmei of Guangdong East Girls' High School and Xi Yongjuan of Peiming Girls' High School, who are participating in the 100-meter sprint, are relatively promising. These two days, they are working hard to practice. Today was originally scheduled to be the last practice, but in order to fully maintain the athletes' physique, it is planned to be cancelled.

At the 5th National Games, Ms. Qian won the first place in individual scoring. The 80-meter low hurdle result from the 6th National Games has not been broken yet. The 100-meter sprint championship and runner-up, Li Sen and Qian Hangsu, have not faded from the minds of sports enthusiasts. However, as time goes by, Li Sen passed away due to childbirth problems in Chengdu five or six years ago. As for Ms. Qian, because of the regulations of the National Games, sports instructors are not allowed to be athletes, so Ms. Qian did not participate in the competition this time. She said apologetically to the reporter: "It's not possible now. After so many years, my physical strength and age are not enough."

According to Ms. Qian's opinion, the most promising units in women's track and field in this National Games are Fujian, Taiwan, and Guangdong. But according to her observation: although the practice results are mediocre, miracles often occur due to excitement and stimulation on the field. She said: "If Shanghai can have unexpected gains in this National Games, it can only be said that it is entirely due to talent, without any training to speak of." Everyone believes that there is no shortage of "talent" in this city. Let us wait for the "miracle" to appear!

### Police Team Attending National Games Arrives in Shanghai with 80 Representatives, Second Batch of Navy Athletes Arrives on the Same Day

### Navy Has Good Athletes in 10,000 Meters, Shot Put, and Javelin

[Our Report] The Navy participated in the National Games, and the second batch of 46 representatives, led by General Team Leader Jia Lianhong, arrived at the city's North Station at 4:05 pm this afternoon on the Beijing-Shanghai train. All personnel are staying at the Navy First Hospital on Sichuan North Road. Various naval units stationed in Shanghai sent representatives to welcome them at the North Station, and a welcoming banquet was held at the Navy Social Center at 6:30 pm last night. The names of all 81 Navy team representatives were seen in the April 28th edition. Currently, only four people, including Li Yongnian and Kou Hongfei, are still staying in the capital due to official business, and the rest have all arrived in the city. The team's athletes, Liu Jingkun's 10,000 meters and 5,000 meters, have quite good results. Wu Zhenwu's shot put can throw 12.30 meters, Wang Xuewu's javelin is often around 50 meters, and Zhang Zhiqing's 400-meter hurdles are 62 seconds. All of them are promising athletes to be selected.

### National Games Tidbits, Honolulu Uniforms are Full of Temptation, Philippine Team Flag Features a Fierce Lion

[Our Newspaper Special] If we compare the uniforms and team emblems worn by athletes from various places participating in the National Games this time, they are truly colorful and beautiful. Generally speaking, overseas Chinese and South Pacific athletes are mostly luxurious and elaborately designed, while athletes from the mainland tend to be simple and unadorned.

Among the costumes that have been seen, the uniforms of the three Hawaiian overseas Chinese representatives are the most unique. They wear cream-colored thin wool sports tops, no lapels, two top buttons, patch pockets, said to be the most popular sports jackets in the United States, lined with Hawaiian shirts with complex floral patterns. The most eye-catching thing is the circular team emblem attached to the small pocket on the chest. The outer circle reads "Aloha Honolulu", with palm tree patterns on both sides, and in the center is a girl wearing a grass skirt, dancing the hula hula. The grass skirt can even be opened and moved, which is truly full of the temptation of tropical flavors!

The first batch of Philippine athletes arrived yesterday. As soon as they got off the plane, they unfurled two dazzling satin flags, one was the national flag and the other was the team flag. The design of the team flag is a white flag bottom, in addition to the words Philippine Overseas Chinese Delegation, etc., there is a shield-shaped team emblem in the middle, with an orange-yellow bottom bordered with bright red, and in the middle is also inlaid with a fierce lion with its teeth and claws bared. It seems that the Philippine Overseas Chinese representatives are determined to seize the Games championship with the perseverance of a fierce lion.

The costumes of the Philippine overseas Chinese representatives are all full sets of dark beige poplin suits. In addition, the male athletes all wear white shirts and beige wool ties. The female athletes all wear white round-neck shirts, and instead of suit pants, they wear skirts that reach the knees, with bare feet and high heels, looking graceful and full of Western girl style.

The numbered seats in the Games swimming pool are located on a stand facing the main entrance, and although the place is not large, it is said that 700 seats will be arranged. When allocated, the width of each seat is only 14 inches. If a fatter person sits down, there is a risk of overflowing the boundaries.

What is most commendable this time is that many overseas Chinese units are participating for the first time in the history of the National Games. Those who have arrived include West Samoa and Honolulu. It is said that the Siamese overseas Chinese representatives will also arrive today. How eager and enthusiastic their expectations for the motherland's National Games are, so cold water must not be poured. This pouring will not only reduce the purpose of the Games, but seriously speaking, the concern of overseas Chinese for the motherland may gradually fade away from now on.

One overseas Chinese representative said: "They repeatedly say that the funds are insufficient, which makes the preparations for the Games seem inadequate everywhere. In fact, this is a specious argument. If the funds are not enough, it is better to postpone the event. Why bother making a big show and attracting overseas people to a climax, and then giving people the reality of facing disappointment, it is inevitable that overseas Chinese will feel cold-hearted towards the motherland."

Among the male and female team members of the Siamese overseas Chinese delegation, those from the Chaozhou and Shantou region account for two-thirds, so it is no exaggeration to say that it is the Chaozhou delegation. The advance unit, Ji Yuejun, had already come to Shanghai to plan everything, and had already negotiated with Zheng Ziliang, the leader of the Chaozhou community in Shanghai. After the team arrives today, they will temporarily stay at the Chaozhou Guild Hall on Yangxing Street.

### World Games Football Team Flies to the Philippines, South China Expeditionary Force Suffers Another Defeat

[United Press, Hong Kong, 30th] The Chinese World Games football team took a plane to Manila at 1:00 pm today. Captain Feng Jingxiang and team member Zhang Jinhai did not go due to business reasons. Before going to England, the World Games team will perform several exhibition matches in the Far East.

[Associated Press, Manila, 30th] In the third battle of the South China football expeditionary force in the Philippines, they were defeated by the Overseas Chinese University United Team 1-3 on the evening of the 29th. The match was still held at the Rizal Stadium. South China captain Liang Rongzhao and starting goalkeeper Li Huihe did not play.

### Preferential Measures for Student Visits

Representatives from the Municipal Private Primary and Secondary School Federation, Jiang Jizhou, Tong Hangbai, Yu Chuanding, Shen Xibin, Mao Jiaju, and Cui Jianwu, etc., visited Mr. Hao, the general director of the National Games, yesterday to discuss preferential measures for school group visits and transportation issues for students in the Games gymnastics. The following agreements were reached: (1) The track and field stadium will reserve 2,000 seats every day to accommodate student visits. The concessionary tickets will be sold at 10,000 yuan per ticket, but the school must apply with a letter. (2) Students participating in the Games gymnastics rehearsal and formal performance will be subsidized for transportation expenses.

### Malay-Cantonese-Guangzhou Athletes: Second Batch Arrived Yesterday by Plane

According to Mr. Lin, half of the Cantonese-Guangzhou athletes have already arrived in Shanghai, and the remaining 70 or so athletes are expected to arrive in Shanghai in batches in the next two days.

Zhenjiang [Report from this Newspaper in Zhenjiang, 30th] The Jiangsu Province delegation participating in the National Games will depart for Shanghai on the night of the 2nd.

Also, according to Li Yangkun, Shi Xuehuang (male), Wang Xuefang, Ran Shufang, Chen Yeqin, and Qi Chunzi (female), who were selected but did not make the trip, they told this newspaper reporter today: The standards set by the Chongqing selection committee are unreasonable. Some standards exceed the national records, such as the 60-meter dash for women, which was set at 7.8 seconds, causing Wang Xuefang, who won the 50-meter, 100-meter, and long jump championships at the last National Games and who now runs the 60-meter in 8 seconds, to be unable to participate in the National Games. In addition, the standard for the 80-meter hurdles for women was set at 15.3 seconds, while the National Games record is 14.8 seconds, which resulted in Zhou Zhongxia, who runs 15 seconds, being selected. Also, Chen Yeqin's discus record is 28.70 meters, and Ran Shufang's high jump is 1.27 meters. They requested an explanation from Yang Sen after he came to Chongqing.

Jiangxi The athletes and representatives from Jiangxi to attend the National Games have already been selected, and the Jiangxi Association in this city has been entrusted by telegram to handle everything on their behalf.

The group is scheduled to depart on May 1st, and a flight letter has been sent to Shanghai. The Jiangxi Association in Shanghai is currently actively preparing for a welcome reception.

Joint Logistics The Joint Logistics team participating in the 7th National Games has a total of over seventy people. After selection, they immediately concentrated on training in Nanjing.

### Several Obscure Operas in *Dream of the Red Chamber* and the Scripts of the Southern Troupe

— Tang Changru

Almost all the operas performed or mentioned in *Dream of the Red Chamber* are *Kunqu*. According to Mr. Hu Shih's research, this book was written before the 18th or 19th year of the Qianlong era. The events described in the book probably took place in the early years of the Yongzheng reign. By the early Qianlong era, northerners were no longer very fond of *Kunqu*. For example, the preface to *Mengzhong Yuan Zhuanqi*, written by Zhang Jian and published in the 15th year of Qianlong, already stated:

The Liyuan troupe in Chang'an (Beijing) reigns supreme... but they only like Qin tunes and *Yiyangqiang*, and hate to hear the Wu sounds. Whenever they hear *Kunqu* songs, they scatter in an uproar. Later, *Yan Guan Xiao Pu*, published in the 50th year of Qianlong, said:

*Kunqu* is not liked by northerners, so there are no generous patrons. Here, the term "northerners" refers only to the general audience, but the literati probably still mainly appreciated *Kunqu*. Moreover, the Cao family, grandfather, grandson, and brothers, served as officials in Jiangnan for a total of fifty years. Cao Yin even engraved the *Lü Gui Bu* and could compose music. It is only natural that a family so influenced by regional culture and heredity would still love *Kunqu*.

Most of the *Kunqu* operas recorded in the book are still popular on the operatic stage today. When the Xian Ni Kunqu Opera Troupe was not disbanded ten years ago, they could perform them.

However, the Jia household did not only perform *Kunqu*. *Yiyangqiang*, which was popular at the time, even infiltrated this scholarly family (to use the words of the book). In the 19th chapter, Jia Zhen invites Baoyu to watch an opera. What is performed is:

*Ding Lang Recognizes His Father*, *Huang Boyang Sets Up the Yin Soul Array*, *Sun Wukong Raises Havoc in Heaven*, *Jiang Ziya Executes Generals and Consecrates Gods*. The 80-chapter edition of the Youzheng Bookstore has a marginal note under this section that reads: "The talents of *Yiyangqiang* are exhausted." The marginal notes in this edition are quite early, and some may even be original notes by Cao Xueqin. Since it says *Yiyangqiang*, it is believable. In the 22nd chapter, the Old Dowager celebrates Baocai's birthday, saying:

On the 21st, a small, simple opera stage was set up in the Old Dowager's inner courtyard, and a troupe of newly emerging opera performers was hired, with both *Kunqu* and *Yiyangqiang* operas. This clearly states that it is *Yiyangqiang*. Furthermore, it can be inferred that at this time, there were already small opera troupes that performed both *Kunqu* and *Yiyangqiang*. The only difference between *Yiyangqiang* and *Kunqu* is the tone and rhythm of the singing; the lyrics are not very different. Therefore, *Tian Zhi Ou Wen* says: "Later, *Yiyangqiang* became popular, commonly known as *Gaoqiang*, which still uses the lyrics of *Kunqu* but changes its tone and rhythm." However, the operas performed are very different. *Kunqu*, after being refined and sifted through by literati, mostly performs stories of talented scholars and beautiful ladies and programs rich in emotion. *Yiyangqiang*, however, tends to favor lively and humorous aspects. The Old Dowager loves excitement and interludes of humor. What Fengjie seeks to cater to the Old Dowager's preferences cannot be found in *Kunqu*, so she can only seek it in *Yiyangqiang*. Let us see what *Yiyangqiang* looked like in Baoyu's eyes in the 19th chapter. The book says:

Ghosts and gods appeared in a chaotic mess, and then demons swarmed out. There were even processions and incense-welcoming ceremonies, and the sounds of drums and shouts could be heard far outside the alley. Everyone in the street praised the liveliness of the opera, which could not be found in other people's homes. This gives an idea of what it was like.

Since *Yiyangqiang* used the old texts of *Kunqu*, can we find these operas mentioned above in *Kunqu* scripts? I do not know the plot of the opera *Ding Lang Recognizes His Father*. *Sun Wukong Raises Havoc in Heaven* is *An Tian Hui*, which is originally a *Kunqu* opera and needs no further explanation. The story of *Huang Boyang Sets Up the Yin Soul Array* is occasionally mentioned in the popular *Later Eastern Zhou Kingdoms*, saying that it is a matter of the prequel, but this prequel is not the current *Annals of the Eastern Kingdoms*, so there is no way to check. However, it is known that Huang Boyang was Yue Yi's teacher. In order to battle the Yin Soul Array against Sun Bin, Sun Bin invited the head teacher, the Antarctic Immortal, down the mountain and subdued Huang Boyang with the Immortal Binding Talisman. There are *Ma Ling Dao* dramas and legends that tell the story of Sun Bin. Volume 9 of the *Qu Hai Zong Mu* compiled by Dong Kang has *Qi Guo Ji* written by Li Yuanyu. The summary says: "Selected Yuan dramas and embellished them into it." There is no mention of Huang Boyang. The *Yangzhou Hua Fang Lu* records that Huang's repertoire also has a *Fan Qi Guo*. I don't know if it has anything to do with this. There is also a kind of *Feng Shen Bang* in the repertoire recorded in the *Hua Fang Lu*, both of which are listed in the mediocre category of one hundred and five kinds of opera lyrics. According to Wang's *Sheng Ping Shu Zhi Lüe*, Chapter 4, Partitioning, the section on performing for the first and fifteenth of the lunar month, records:

*Sheng Ping Bao Fa*. According to *Xiao Ting Za Lu*, it was made by Zhang Detian in the early Qianlong period to perform the story of Tang Xuanzang's journey to the West.

*Feng Shen Tian Bang*. The original note says that it is the same as *Feng Shen Yan Yi*.

*Jian Feng Chun Qiu*. The original note says the name of the novel is the same, and it tells the story of Sun Bin and his son in the Later Seven Kingdoms.

*Ping Ling Hui*. The original note says it is slightly the same as the previous work. Wang also said: Now, examining the secret collections of cultural relics of the Sheng Ping Shu, apart from the printed edition of *Quan Shan Jin Ke*, the rest of the major operas are all finely copied Southern Troupe versions. Those that were later moved to the Sheng Ping Shu can be determined to be old objects from the Qianlong period without a doubt.

According to *Xiao Ting Za Lu*, various major operas of the Southern Troupe were all compiled during or after the Qianlong period. Some of them were newly made, and some were adapted from old versions. For example, *Sheng Ping Bao Fa* came from *Journey to the West*, *Feng Shen Tian Bang* came from *Feng Shen Bang*, and *Jian Feng Chun Qiu* and *Ping Ling Hui* came from *Ma Ling Dao*, *Qi Guo Ji*, *Fan Qi Guo*, *Huang Boyang Sets Up the Yin Soul Array* and the like. Zhao Yuncong's *Yan Pu Za Ji* describes the grand occasion of the Qianlong 21st year of the Longevity Festival at Rehe: The autumn hunt went to Rehe, and all the Mongolian princes watched. The Longevity Holy Festival was two days before Mid-Autumn Festival, so on the sixth day of the month, a grand opera was performed until the fifteenth day. The operas performed mostly used gods and monsters from *Journey to the West* and *Feng Shen Chuan*. Its absurdity and unreliability were unrestricted, and it could be embellished out of thin air, bizarre and strange, truly a grand sight. The opera stage was nine *yan* wide and had three layers. The demons played sometimes came from above and sometimes protruded from below... Sometimes gods and ghosts gathered together, with hundreds of masks and no two alike (omitted below). The liveliness described matches what Baoyu saw. I think it was probably also sung in *Yiyangqiang*.

In the 29th chapter of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, the Old Dowager offers incense at Qingxu Monastery, and what they perform is

*Legend of the White Snake*, *A Bed Full of Tablets*,

*A Dream of Nanke*. These are three complete operas, performed over three days. The 28th chapter says: The people in charge said again: "Yesterday, the Imperial Concubine sent Eunuch Xia out to deliver one hundred and twenty taels of silver, asking to hold a three-day peace-seeking Taoist ceremony at Qingxu Monastery from the first to the third day of the month, performing operas and offering sacrifices."

It can be known that it had to be performed for three days, otherwise it could not be finished. This *Legend of the White Snake* is also quite obscure. The book says:

Jia Zhen came back for a while and said, "An opera has been chosen before the gods. The first opera is *Legend of the White Snake*." The Old Dowager asked, "What is the story of *Legend of the White Snake*?" Jia Zhen said: "It is the story that starts with Emperor Gaozu of Han slaying the snake." Volume 5 of *Qu Hai Zong Mu* has *Bai She Ji*, and the summary says:

Compiled by Guo Xuan, a native of Zhejiang. It is an old version from the early Ming Dynasty, later changed to *Luan Chai Ji*. This play is named *Legend of the White Snake* because Liu Hanqing saved the white snake and released it, which led to his nobility and prominence. Although the name is the same, the plot is different. Fortunately, the Old Dowager asked, otherwise they would have definitely regarded it as *Lei Feng Pagoda* or *Lan Chai Ji*. However, even the Old Dowager, who had watched operas for decades, did not know what the story was, which shows how obscure it was. The *Sheng Ping Shu Zhi Lüe* has *Chu Han Zhuan*. The note says: "Slightly the same as *Western Han Romance*." *Legend of the White Snake* is probably the first volume of *Chu Han Zhuan*. Twenty years ago, the Dan Gui First Stage and the Gong Wu Stage in Shanghai both rehearsed the serial opera *Emperor Gaozu of Han*. Most of those table operas, apart from current affairs dramas, were adapted from old versions. This *Emperor Gaozu of Han* is probably the *Chu Han Zhuan* recorded in *Sheng Ping Shu Zhi*. I remember that the first volume was precisely the story of slaying the white snake. If this guess is correct, then there should have been *Legend of the White Snake* first, and later the Southern Troupe adapted it based on it and added some miscellaneous dramas and legends telling the story of Emperor Gaozu to form *Chu Han Zhuan*, and finally it was changed to *pihuang* and performed outside.

In the 53rd chapter, the Old Dowager celebrates the Lantern Festival, saying:

Musk Moon and others asked, "What is she holding in her hand?" The daughter-in-laws said, "It is the food that the Old Dowager is rewarding with golden flowers to each young lady." Autumn Grain laughed and said: "The opera outside is singing *Eight Virtues*, but not *Hun Yuan He*. Where did the Golden Flower Goddess come from?"

Volume 40 of *Qu Hai Zong Mu* has *Hun Yuan He*. The summary says:

Made by recent people, absurd and unreliable, roughly imitating books such as *Feng Shen Yan Yi* and *Journey to the West*, concocted out of thin air to please the eyes and ears of the moment. The so-called "recent times" probably also refers to before Qianlong. *Hun Yuan He* also appeared in the mediocre category of one hundred and five kinds of opera lyrics in *Yangzhou Hua Fang Lu*. Chapter 4 of *Sheng Ping Zhi Lüe*, Section on Duanwu Performances, says:

For large-scale serial operas, there are

*Elucidating the Tao and Eliminating Evil* and *Hun Yuan He*. According to this, this opera also flowed from the folk into the imperial court. Item 37 of *Qing Bai Lei Chao*, Notes on Opera Performances in the Summer Palace, says:

Yu Runxian first arranged

and performed *Hun Yuan He*. All its

equipment was mostly borrowed from the Imperial Household. This item is unknown from which book it was recorded. Most of it plagiarized the Longevity section of *Yan Pu Za Ji* in the 21st year of Qianlong, using the events of the Qianlong years to talk about the liveliness of opera performances in the Summer Palace, which is ridiculous. However, at the end of the Qing Dynasty, *Hun Yuan He* flowed from the imperial court to the folk again, just like *Legend of the White Snake*. Other operas such as *Yan Men Guan* and *Wu Cai Yun* are also like this.

In summary, we can know that during the Yongzheng and Qianlong periods, *Yiyangqiang* was popular, and even families like the Jia household, that is, the Cao family, often performed it. After the Qianlong period, it successively entered the imperial court. Therefore, almost all the obscure operas in *Dream of the Red Chamber* can be found in the major Southern Troupe operas preserved by the Sheng Ping Shu. I have no research on the history of opera. I am only presenting some materials for conversation, but even these materials are well-known to everyone.

### On the Use of "余" in Stone Drum Inscriptions Instead of "朕"

— Tang Lan

Reply to Mr. Tong Shuye Again

The Stone Drum Inscriptions use "余" (I), '[　]' , and "我" (I), but not the character "朕" (royal I). I believe they should be dated after the Qin Gong Bell and Qin Gong Gui and close to the era of the Cursing Chu Texts. Recently, Mr. Tong Shuye, in his article "Another Question for Mr. Tang Lan on the Era of the Stone Drum Inscriptions" (see the Shanghai Central Daily News Cultural Relics Weekly, issue 77), put forward a novel opinion, saying:

The grammar of the Stone Drum Inscriptions is closer to the Eastern system, so it uses the character "吾" (I). It is not entirely the same as the characters used in other bronze inscriptions and can only prove that it is an Eastern dialect; it cannot prove that its era is late.

This is very worthy of attention. I very much agree that the character '[虞]' (I) is originally an Eastern language element, because it is the same as the situation with the character "也" (also). Now, Mr. Tong's new theory and my theory have finally found a common point. However, how could the Qin state's stone inscriptions use an Eastern dialect and also write it as "吾" (I)? Mr. Tong believes that "the Qin ethnicity originally came from the Huaiyi, also an Eastern ethnicity, so its script is also close to the Eastern system," but this is probably not necessarily the case. During the Warring States period, the six states used the ancient script, which was Eastern script. The Qin state used the Da Zhuan script and the Small Seal script, which were Western scripts. This kind of distinction did not happen suddenly. From the perspective of language, "吾" (I) is equivalent to '[虞]' (I), and "毆" is close to "也" (also), but from the perspective of script, the Qin state has always inherited the Western system.

I don't want to discuss the Qin ethnicity issue here. Even if the Qin state was selected from the East, it ultimately always resided in the northwestern land. From Qin Fei onwards until before Qin Zheng merged the six states, it was always a Western state. If it is said that the Qin state still preserved the Eastern language in its early days and wrote "虞" as '[　]' (I), then why did the bell and Gui of the time of Duke Jing of Qin use the character "朕" (royal I)? Why did the Cursing Chu Texts of the late Warring States period suddenly think of this "吾" (I) and not use "朕" (royal I)? This is probably impossible to explain forever.

Of course, Mr. Tong can say that the Eastern ethnicities also used the character "朕" (royal I). He cites the Qi Hou Bo bell with the Xue clan inscription as evidence. But I want to point out here that while the Qi Hou Bo bell and mirror used the character "朕" (royal I), they did not use the character '[　]' (I). The first-person pronouns they used were only the three characters "余" (I), "朕" (royal I), and "辝" (I), which is the same as the Qi Jiang Ding. However, the Qi Bo bell, which is also a bronze artifact from the Qi state, has the character '[　]' (I), but it does not have the character "朕" (royal I). It only has the three characters "余" (I), '[　]' (I), and '[　]' (I). This phenomenon is exactly the same as the Qin state's bronze and stone inscriptions. I wonder how Mr. Tong will explain it? Does the appearance of the character '[　]' (I) and the disappearance of the character "朕" (royal I) stem from dialect? From the era? Or is it a clever trick to say that the first two artifacts just happened not to need the character '[　]' (I), and the latter artifact just happened not to use the character "朕" (royal I)?

In our view, only the order of eras can explain it. The Qi Hou Bo bell, which uses the character "朕" (royal I), is a bronze artifact from the era of Duke Ling of Qi (581-554 BC), while the [　][　] which uses the character "　" (I), is later. This is a fact, and there is no need to insist. Having "朕" (royal I) but not '[習]' (I), having "吾" (I) then not having "朕" (royal I), this is my humble opinion. Mr. Tong is lavishly talking about "吾" (I) and "我" (I) being interchangeable. Isn't this missing the point entirely?

In short, whether in the East or West, from divination inscriptions to bronze inscriptions, the character "吾" (I) has never been used as a pronoun. This is undoubtedly a new language. During the Spring and Autumn period, the Shen Er Bell of the Xu state seems to be the first to use the character "　" (I). The Qi state still used the character "朕" (royal I) during the time of Duke Ling (the death of Duke Ling of Qi was in the 29th year of Duke Jing of Qin, two years before Confucius was born). Then, the adoption of the character "　" (I) should generally be dated to the late Spring and Autumn period. The 杕氏 Gui is undoubtedly a northern bronze artifact and also uses the character "　" (I). Its period is probably around the transition from the Spring and Autumn period to the Warring States period. Looking again at the Qin state in the West, at least during the time of Duke Jing of Qin, it still only used the character "朕" (royal I), which was contemporary with Duke Ling of Qi. When this new language spread from the East to the West, the Qin people used a character derived from the sound of "吾" (I) to represent it, and that is how the "　" (I) of the Stone Drum Inscriptions of the early Warring States period and the "梧" (I) of the Cursing Chu Texts of the late Warring States period came about. By this time, the pronoun "朕" (royal I) was already a dead language. Therefore, the ancient saying used "朕" (royal I), and the new language used "吾" (I). In principle, these two pronouns do not overlap. We can infer that the disappearance of the character "朕" (royal I) and the popularity of the character "吾" (I) should have been around the transition from the Spring and Autumn period to the Warring States period, based on the fact that the character "朕" (royal I) was still in use during the time of Duke Ling of Qi and Duke Jing of Qin, and that the character "吾" (I) was so prevalent after the Analects.

After the Warring States period, except for quotations from ancient books or ancient books compiled later that contain the character "朕" (royal I), it was generally no longer used. However, there are exceptions in the Chu Ci, where both "Li Sao" and "Zhao Hun" have the character "朕" (royal I). "Zhao Hun" only appears once, and it seems to be imitating "Li Sao," so it can be disregarded. The usage in "Li Sao" is the most peculiar. In addition to the three characters "余" (I), "吾" (I), and "我" (I), it not only adds "朕" (royal I) but also adds "予" (I), making a total of five first-person pronouns. I suspect this is the technique of the writer, for example:

"I am a descendant of the Emperor Gaoyang; My late father was called Boyong. When the conjunction of Sheti was in the first month, On the day of Gengyin I was born. He considered my destiny at the beginning, And bestowed upon me a fine name, Called me Zhengze, And styled me Lingjun."

There is a "朕" (royal I) in the front, an "吾" (I) character, and then four "余" (I) characters at the end. Again, such as:

"I regret that I did not carefully examine the road, I will delay and wait for a long time, I will return. Turn my chariot to return to the road, Before I go astray. I walk my horse on the orchid bank, And stop in the pepper hill. I will not enter and leave evil, And I will return to repair my old clothes." The grammar of "朕 chariot" and "余 horse" is the same, but the character "朕" (royal I) is used. Later, it says "屯 余 車 其 千 乘 兮," and only the character "余" (I) is used, which shows that he was just switching them around for the beauty of the writing. If it is believed that the ancient language still preserved this ancient language "朕" (royal I) at that time, then one would be greatly deceived by him.

In ancient standard speech, "余" (I) and "女" (you) are equivalent to the current "我" (I) and "你" (you), "朕" (royal I) and "乃" (your) are equivalent to "我的" (my) and "你的" (your), and "我" (we) and "爾" (you) are equivalent to "我們" (we/us) and "你們" (you), or "我們的" (our) and "你們的" (your). There are always exceptions. People today say "我們" (we/us), and sometimes it only represents "我" (I). Last time I said:

The first-person pronoun is almost the same as what Mr. Tong said, but the character "我" (I/we) seems to be used more often.

It was only a rough outline of the principle, not a discussion. Because the question of the majority or minority is originally outside the topic. The intention was only to indicate that I did not necessarily not know that the character "我" (I/we) is used in the plural. Whether the grammar is clearly understood or not is just a digression and has nothing to do with honor or disgrace. "Exclusively used" can be changed to "used more often," and "seems" was originally not a definitive conclusion. Mr. Tong's persistent arguing, even if there is a reason, is aimless. The original text is there and can be reviewed.

As for why Mr. Tong doesn't understand why I don't refute his proposed evidence that the Stone Drum Inscriptions are works from the early Eastern Zhou period, I have actually clearly stated that if my three pieces of evidence '[　]' (I), '[殹]' (end), and '[迂]' (bend) are completely untenable, then I must admit that my conclusion of moving the Stone Drum Inscriptions to the Warring States period is wrong. If one of them is tenable, then the claim that the Stone Drum Inscriptions are before Duke Jing is definitely wrong. The battle lines are clearly drawn. Why waste ink on other side issues? For example, Mr. Tong says that "the Qin state in the early Warring States period did not have any involvement with the Zhou Son of Heaven, so the inscriptions on Qin artifacts at that time would not need the Zhou Son of Heaven to embellish them at all." He does not seem to have flipped through the "Annals of Qin." In the twenty-first year of Duke Xian, the Son of Heaven congratulated him with [　][　]. In the second year of Duke Xiao, the Son of Heaven presented sacrificial meat. In the nineteenth year, the Son of Heaven presented the title of Earl. In the twentieth year, he paid homage to the Son of Heaven. In the second year of Lord Huiwen, the Son of Heaven congratulated him. In the fourth year, the Son of Heaven presented civilian and military rewards. These facts can prove that from the time of Duke Ling, the Qin state still needed the Zhou Son of Heaven to embellish them for another ninety years. It had already reached the mid-Warring States period. Soon, the Qin state itself claimed to be a kingdom.

Mr. Tong says that the character '[　]' (I) is used in the Stone Drum Inscriptions in fifteen places. I only thanked him last time for correcting it to fourteen places because one place does not follow "午" (noon) but follows "支" (branch) and is definitely not a pronoun. Since I had no intention of taking advantage of a gap or nitpicking, I changed it to fourteen places. It was neither a clerical error nor a printing error. I hereby declare this because it was mentioned.

### Random Notes on Returning Home

— Wen Jie

The Qianjiang Bridge began construction two or three years before the War of Resistance. I remember that when I crossed the Qianjiang River once before the war, I saw that the bridge foundations had a rough outline, but when I crossed the river again on the return trip, I saw that large foundation stones had been washed away by the river. The difficulty of the project can be seen from this. I heard that the project was only completed around the start of the War of Resistance against Japan in 1937, and it had been used by military vehicles a few times. It had never been open to civilian use. Not long after the War of Resistance, it was destroyed by enemy bombing. It was repaired and opened to traffic after the victory. The bridge is over 130 meters long and has two levels: the upper level is for cars and military vehicles, and the lower level is for the railway connecting the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line. It looks neat and beautiful and is truly magnificent. I couldn't help but feel moved when I saw this bridge, and I felt that China had great hope. However, the railings on both sides of the bridge, except for the two ends, had not yet been repaired in the middle section. The pedestrian walkways were also a bit narrow. It is said that they will be widened soon. At that time, pedestrians will not have to take cars or ferries to reach the other side.

After crossing the Qiantang River, I transferred to a long-distance bus from Xiaoshan to Cao'e. This highway existed before the war, but it is still not very smooth, especially the section from the riverside to Shaoxing. Every time the bus crosses a bridge, it jumps greatly, just like the cyclical jumps in commodity prices. I just remember that during the War of Resistance, I heard that the highways in Guilin were even more uneven than this. It is said that when the car jumps on the uneven road surface, passengers are often jolted off their seats, up to a foot high, and their heads hit the roof of the car. Some passengers even have their teeth knocked out. Although the Xiaoshan-Cao'e highway can also cause passengers to be jolted off their seats, it does not cause passengers' heads to hit the roof of the car. In short, although the road surface is uneven, we can still consider it progress in transportation that we have these few highways, and we don't have to be overly demanding. Highway buses, like trains, also have reserved and unreserved seats. I think this point needs to be improved. It is necessary to implement reserved seating across the board.

Whether it is a train or a bus, wherever it goes, we can always see grave mounds. As far as the eye can see, there is almost no place without grave mounds. We can directly say that there is no clean land. I can't help but think: It's a pity that so much good land is occupied by dead people. Our country is known as an agricultural country, but the national food supply is probably mostly insufficient, so we often need to import food from foreign countries. If the government orders people to move the grave mounds and use this land to grow food, although we don't have precise statistics, it can be asserted that it would be of some help in increasing food production. Our people have always valued the corpses of the dead and also pay attention to so-called "feng shui," resulting in the strange phenomenon of grave mounds all over the country. I have not researched when the system of tombs began. However, according to Mencius, "In ancient times, coffins and outer coffins had no limits. In the middle ages, coffins were seven inches thick, and they were bound accordingly." This shows that things like "outer coffins" already existed when Mencius referred to "ancient times." Of course, at first it was "not just for beauty," but it was just a point for the living to "do their best." However, so many hundreds of thousands of years have passed, and so many people have died during that time. The land occupied by one grave and one outer coffin can only be calculated in square feet. It is not possible to concentrate the dead like skyscrapers in a city to form a cube. How much land do you think the dead have occupied from the living over the past thousands of years? Moreover, the living are continuing to increase. According to the population scholar Malthus, the population increases according to a geometric progression. If this is accurate, even without the dead, the living themselves will eventually fill the earth. Moreover, the living are the opposite of the dead, and the living will eventually become the dead. Since the living are increasing according to a geometric progression, the increase in the number of dead people is also naturally increasing according to a geometric progression. Based on this reasoning, if the living do not find ways to improve burial methods, one day the dead will make it so that the living have no place to stand when they are alive and no place to be buried when they are dead. However, our country has a tradition of respecting ancestors. If the government orders the people to move the graves in agricultural fields within a certain period of time, the public opinion will surely be in an uproar. But at least we can do this: we will not allow officials or commoners to use agricultural fields as burial grounds in the future. However, the people of our country are known for being exceptionally clever. I expect that when this order is issued, people will build new graves on agricultural fields, and the tombstones will definitely have inverted dates, calling them longevity fields. I remember that when the highway was being built before the war, there was a conflict between the highway and the graves, and it was impossible to have both. The tomb owners would spend money to make the highway turn; there were also cases where the highway and the graves did not conflict at all, but the road builders deliberately claimed that they would destroy the graves and build the road in order to extort money. Dealing with public affairs with this kind of attitude is discouraging.

When the bus passed through Shaoxing city, I repeatedly saw jar [　] piled up like mountains on both sides of the highway. It seems that this is also an important industry in Shaoxing. Although these large and small jars and [　] are not as delicate as Jiangxi porcelain in appearance, and their styles are not as beautiful as Jiangxi porcelain, they are both made of earth and used to hold things, which is what the two have in common. Personally, I like jars and porcelain more than porcelain. Although its exquisiteness is not as good as porcelain, its simplicity and rusticity surpass it, just like the rough-line style in certain novels. It has a different charm when you look at it.

Shaoxing wine is really good. The mellow and delicious taste cannot be described in detail without tasting it yourself. I have lived in Shanghai, a large commercial city, for so many years, and I have never drunk such good wine. The methods of brewing wine in various places must be the same, with no secrets. I guess it is mostly due to the different quality of rice. The rice in my hometown is really good. When cooked, it smells fragrant and tastes sweet, unlike the so-called "Du rice" or "thin rice" or "thick japonica" sold in rice shops in this city. It is already secondary that it tastes bland in the mouth. When chewing it, it seems that there is residue. Thinking about it, it is really better to return home.

### A Philosopher Afraid of His Wife

— Xiang Wen

The great Greek philosopher Socrates was a very amiable person, but his wife, Xanthippe, was not only bad-tempered but also unable to understand him at all. Of course, there was even less talk of comfort and help. Therefore, he spent his time outside every day, talking and laughing with some young friends to relieve the depression at home.

One day, he played outside all day. When he came back, his wife was doing laundry. Seeing that he was playing outside every day, she was so angry that she cursed him. Still unable to calm down, she picked up the bucket of laundry water and poured it over his head, soaking him all over like a drowned chicken. But he was not angry at all and even smiled humorously, saying: "I know that after angry thunder, there must be a heavy rain."

### Eating in Chengdu

— Mou Dunpei

"Dress in Chongqing, eat in Chengdu." These two sentences are easy to hear in Sichuan. Let's not talk about "Air in Chongqing" for now and talk about eating in Chengdu.

Anyone who has lived in Chengdu will know these slightly famous foods, especially the snacks. The variety is large and the reputation is high. From the beautiful dishes in grand restaurants with complete facilities to the simplest and most economical dandan noodles, each has its own special flavor.

Near Chunzhao North Road, there is a "Chicken Oil Lai Tangyuan." Perhaps some people are wondering why the character "赖" (Lai) is used as the brand name for tangyuan (sweet dumplings). In fact, many years ago, there was a person named Lai who opened a tangyuan shop. Because he had special skills, he attracted customer praise. It spread from one to ten, and from ten to a hundred. He actually became worth a hundred times as much, and admirers came in an endless stream. After the boss died, his descendants continued this profession and hung up the "Lai" Tangyuan sign.

Lai Tangyuan indeed has a special flavor. I have tried it several times. The storefront is not very large. There are only four square tables on the front, and there are two or three other tables next to the alley. The appearance of the tangyuan is not much different from other places. It is filled with black sesame, chicken oil, sugar, etc., and there is also a small bowl of sesame sauce to dip it in. However, it tastes very delicious and different from others. Every day, the place is always crowded. Especially in the morning, eaters line up in long queues like buying household rice, waiting for a seat. Even more people rush to eat its "name." I once asked a shop assistant: "Why do other people use the same ingredients, but it is not as delicious as yours?" The answer was: "Family secret recipe!"

"Wu Chaoshou"—Chaoshou is wonton, which was passed down by a person named Wu. The taste is wonderful, and the skin is made exquisitely. After being cooked, the meat inside the skin can be clearly seen, and the skin will not break. Because the business is booming, several branches have been opened, but according to experienced people, it is not as good as Wu Chaoshou.

"Mapo Tofu"—It can be seen at a glance that it is tofu made by a pockmarked woman. She doesn't use gypsum to make it, probably she uses [　]. It is said that her reputation dates back to the Three Kingdoms period, when Zhuge Liang sent a large army to northern Sichuan to defend against Cao Bing's invasion. When the team rested at the north gate of Chengdu, many soldiers went to find something to eat and discovered her [　][　] and swept it away. At that time, the weather was beautiful, and suddenly there was a heavy rain, preventing the march. The soldiers advertised it greatly for three days, so everyone knew about it. Because the proprietress was pockmarked, they named it that way. Mapo became very popular, and its fame continues to this day. The tofu shop is still open near the north gate.

### Willow Branch Lyrics

— Bi [𧮯]

Ten miles of weeping willows reflect the hairpins, the southern regions have had good springs throughout history. On the warm-wind-sunny-day causeway, Wu girls tie up boats to watch plays.

White silk spring dress, jade bracelet around, eastern neighbor girls return from spring outing, small garden butterflies should remember, they once flew past willow catkins to brush against sideburns.

Do you remember when the golden [　] leaves were warm, red lanterns and crimson sleeves, dancing to spring words? Tonight, dream rains at Jialing Station, a tree of weeping willows, a cuckoo.

A thousand worries in the heart, forcing self-control, tears in the guest's eyes, known in dreams, the soul has already feared the shadow of the willow branches, a drizzle again for no reason.

Fallen flowers stir dreams indistinctly, faint red buildings in a line of rain, the most heart-wrenching is the end of the world, eastern wall willow leaves, northern wall [　].

Self-attracting the east wind without knowing it, apricot beam purple swallow delays the return date, weeping willows green all over the southern regions' road, a line of lovesickness, especially to give to whom?

How many times have I seen the spring breeze on the tips of the willows, Bai Men misty rain, how can I bear to throw it away! Pity the swallows returning, not recognizing the new mud as the old nest.

### Xu Wenchang on Disguise

Nowadays, many tactics emphasize disguise. When fighting in green fields, one must wear grass-green clothing. Unexpectedly, Xu Wenchang of the Ming Dynasty also had a suggestion for disguise and surprise attack. In his draft of a letter to the Inspectorate, he said: "For those who are divided into ambush soldiers, they should be dressed in green clothes from head to toe, blending with the color of grass and trees, with only the eyes and ears exposed to see and hear, and with their mouths stuffed with gags to hide at night, so as not to make any noise." Also, in his draft of a letter to the Provincial Governor, he said: "One can send twenty strong men at night, with their mouths stuffed with gags, their heads and feet wrapped in green, blending with the color of the grass and plants, [　][　] come out of the deep seedlings, and cross the narrow waters."

It can be seen that the tactic of disguise is not copied from the West. It really existed in ancient times. (Hong Xian)

### Meteor

— Jing Tao

Life is just like a meteor. It comes from chance and goes suddenly. Although it has flown across space, through the stars, and sometimes even happened to skim past the bright moon, when it descends to the end of the earth, it is just a meteorite, a speck of dust. It has no direct reaction to the earth, and what effect will it have on the vast and distant space? Perhaps only in the moment of its fall will it cause a few surprises and praises, but are these few praises for the meteor itself or for this spectacle of space? This is the mystery of life.

### The Harm of Adulterating Tung Oil in Cooking Oil

— Shou Zhu

For several days, the newspapers have reported that Chen Zizhan, a Shanghai merchant, was holding a memorial service in Suzhou. The relatives and friends who participated were all poisoned because they ate vegetarian food. According to a doctor, this was caused by the adulteration of tung oil in cooking oil. Regarding this matter, I can prove the truth of his statement as follows:

After the War of Resistance, I lived in Minhou. I made ink paste several times. At first, I used sesame oil, but later, because it was not easy to purchase, and according to old books, rapeseed oil was better than sesame oil, I changed to using rapeseed oil. At first, there was nothing unusual. Later, as transportation became more difficult and life became more expensive, the price of cooking oil rose endlessly. Although cooking oil is a daily necessity, there were very few operators due to its inconvenience [　]transport[　], and the profit was not very high. So, merchants came up with a strange idea: to mix tung oil into it. At that time, tung oil could not be exported, and the price dropped sharply. Using it to adulterate cooking oil could double the profit. If the amount of adulteration was not large, one would only feel that the oil was more viscous, and there would be no reaction after eating it. If it was adulterated more, it would not even be bright when used for lighting. After eating it, one would easily be poisoned, with symptoms such as dizziness and abdominal pain. Severe cases would involve vomiting and diarrhea, and it would take one or two days and nights to recover. However, if the oil was boiled a lot in the pot, or if the dishes were cooked a lot, one might be spared the harm. Therefore, people mostly did not suspect it.

One evening, I returned home from a social event. It was already dusk. As I was about to go to bed, all four members of my family complained of dizziness and abdominal pain and could not fall asleep. I suspected that the food was unclean or not cooked thoroughly, but after questioning them in detail about what they had eaten, there was no reason to cause illness. One daughter, because she ate a larger amount, vomited due to abdominal pain. Suspecting that there was poison in the oil, I angrily blamed the maid for not buying the oil carefully, which led to a big quarrel. But I said that there was absolutely no reason to be poisoned by cooking oil and strongly refuted their nonsense. The maid was only able to get out of bed the next day after having diarrhea. The others recovered overnight. In that place at that time, it was customary to specify that you were buying oil for eating when you bought oil, otherwise they would respond with lamp oil. Before long, a portion of the ink paste I made gradually hardened, and a thin film formed on the surface. The rapeseed oil I used to make the paste was purchased and refined in several batches. Thinking back to the previous incident, I began to suspect that tung oil might have been mixed into the cooking oil. However, I still did not dare to fully believe it and accuse people falsely. After several months, a friend invited me to do cooking oil business together. I declined, saying that this item was inconvenient to purchase and transport, and there was little profit to be made. The friend laughed and said, "You are really a fool. If you mix tung oil into it, the profit is greater than any other business." I was shocked and quickly told him about the previous incident and advised him not to be blinded by profit and disregard morality. The friend became wary and gave up.

Tung oil is a drying oil that can only be used for paint. It is toxic and cannot be eaten. Today, the price of cooking oil is high, and merchants are only interested in making profits, losing all conscience, [　][　] tung oil to ask for a good price. Their crime is no different from bandits. However, if prices continue to rise like this, then in the future [　] those who mix for the sake of high profits, I am afraid, will never cease.

### Saving Electricity

— He Dao

A: "Why are you so depressed, my friend?"

B: "Alas, my wife went to the countryside for six weeks and came back today."

A: "Your wife returning home is a great thing, why are you so anxious?"

B: "Let me tell you the truth: When my wife was in the countryside, she often wrote to ask me if I was being honest and obedient, and following the rules. I wrote back to tell her that during these six weeks, I stayed at home every day and spent my time reading medicine and newspapers—but just as she entered the door today, the electricity company sent the bill for last month, saying that our household used a total of only one kilowatt-hour of electricity for the entire month."

The several major elections and the power to draft the constitution in the early Republic belonged to the National Assembly. Although there were special election committees and constitutional drafting committees, the members of these special bodies were all elected from members of the two houses of the National Assembly. Thus, the authority of the National Assembly was limitless, and legislation virtually turned into a "supreme government," which was greatly contrary to the legal concept of the three branches of government standing on equal footing. At that time, this old fellow was busy with the life of a news reporter, dealing with the parliament and parliamentarians every day. One day, while chatting with a parliamentarian friend, I said, "You hundreds of 'Arhats' have boundless powers, managing everything, and supervising every organization. Who should supervise you? Or do you only manage others and not be managed by anyone, like 'Heavenly Kings and Enlightened Sages,' 'sacred and inviolable'?" This friend laughed and said, "Those who supervise the parliamentarians are only the news reporters. Their criticisms and scoldings are more free than the impeachment of officials by the parliamentarians. Reporters make fun of officials, and reporters also make fun of parliamentarians." His words were also true, but joking is not serious after all. National power should be balanced and not monopolized by one side. Therefore, although I am not a legalist, I cannot help but be skeptical. Now, elections and constitution-making are carried out by the National Assembly, a fundamental organization, which is separated from the Legislative Yuan. Impeachment is handled by the Control Yuan separately, which is clear and understandable, and much more progressive than the chaos of the past.

### Small Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

Memories are like paintings, the clear ones are Western oil paintings with bright colors, and the vague ones are like lightly sketched Chinese landscapes.

A person who wants nothing is a person who fears nothing; because he fears nothing, he has a sense of pride, a pitiful, desolate pride.

### The Art of Living

— Ouyang Ming

Living in a "foreign concession" where one cannot see a single bit of green for miles, it is truly difficult to talk about a spiritual life and its art that takes nature as its foundation and the return of the spirit as its goal, much like trying to do good in a yamen (government office), almost like searching with a hundred ropes and finding nothing. The techniques of the Barbizon school masters, who lived beside the secluded forests of green fields, are obviously different from the commodities in the bustling streets of Paris. Gauguin's main reason for leaving the tightly organized society and going to a desolate island in the South Seas to live his life, which was considered crazy, was also his aversion to this kind of living environment that destroyed the inch of clear light in his heart.

According to the above, does it mean that people who are imprisoned in cities have no right to engage in spiritual activities? If we affirm the true foundation of modern life, which should be built on a more extensive and in-depth spiritual activity than before, then the foreign concession where one cannot see a single bit of green for miles is not necessarily a suffocating hell. As long as you are good at utilizing it - proficient in the art of living, creating an artistic life - where can't you find beauty that deserves your amazement?

What is the art of living? It is to strive to pursue an artistic life. The former is the method, and the latter is the practice, but in essence, it is an inseparable whole. Every day, when you get a little free time, listen to a good piece of music, look at a good painting, or read a good poem or prose. Under the light of a five-candlepower electric lamp, a cup of bitter tea, and a cheap cigarette are enough to make you forget your troubles and enjoy the aftertaste of life. The next day, you will be very busy and work hard for food and clothing, but you will definitely be able to do it with twice the efficiency and pleasure. Because your life is not just selling time and labor, it is actually playing the most inexhaustible, the least troublesome, and the sweetest game in the world.

### In Memory of Mr. Ye Qiuyuan (Part 1)

— Chu Yukun

On the morning of March 2nd, I was lying in bed reading the Shen Bao when I suddenly saw the news of Mr. Ye Qiuyuan's death. I almost didn't believe it was true, and I thought I was dreaming. Because I had received a phone call from Mrs. Ye last night, telling me: "Mr. Ye has recovered and been discharged from the hospital for three or four days. Because he received guests at home in the morning and talked too much, he felt quite tired, and his temperature suddenly increased again. To be cautious, he has been sent to the Gōngjì Hospital to stay for a few more days." After the phone hung up, Mr. Pan Gongzhan came to the office to read the editorial to be published tomorrow, and Mr. Chen Xunyou came to visit Mr. Pan for some matters. Walking past the editorial department, they both asked me about Mr. Ye's condition, and I repeated Mrs. Ye's words to them. Everyone didn't take it to heart. No one expected that in a short one or two hours, Mr. Ye would pass away.

My acquaintance with Mr. Ye was not very long, but because I had been seeing him in the editorial office of the Shen Bao every day for the past two years, in addition to discussing the topics of editorials, we talked about everything, from top to bottom, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, so it can be said that we knew each other well enough. Mr. Ye claimed to be "naturally fond of plainness" during his lifetime. From his speech and demeanor, we can see that he was indeed a scholar who was "naturally fond of plainness." Not only did he not compete with the world, but he was also humble in everything. For example, last year, when the Legislative Yuan was being elected, I asked Mr. Ye several times whether he would participate. He always shook his head and said, "I have been a member of the Legislative Yuan for six or seven years, and I should also take a rest and let others be it!" Later, after encouragement from President Sun, he reluctantly registered. After being nominated by the political party, but after learning that the Beijing-Shanghai area had doubled the number of free elections, Mr. Ye decided to give up. Before he wrote a letter to declare his abandonment, I often advised him to discuss it with Mr. Pan Gongzhan, or he could help. However, when he met Mr. Pan, he never mentioned this matter, and the letter of abandonment of the election had already been sent. Later, Mr. Ye's vacancy was filled by Ms. Zheng Yuxiu. Outsiders who did not know the inside story made many unpleasant rumors, and even the Nanjing correspondent of ×× newspaper also said how Mr. Ye was, how he was. I was very angry when I read the newspaper, and I felt that the so-called "inside news" at the moment was nothing more than some "speculative words." That night, I met Mr. Ye and pointed out the ×× newspaper to him and advised him to write a letter to correct it. But Mr. Ye laughed after reading it. He said, "No matter what it says? As long as I haven't accepted bribes from others, why bother to correct it?" This kind of open and upright attitude was really touching. I wonder what the author who wrote this Nanjing correspondence will think after reading my text?

Regardless of whether they knew him or not, all those who knew Mr. Ye's articles and morality believed that Mr. Ye's death was not only a loss to the Shen Bao, but also a major loss to Chinese society. Mr. Ye was not only a famous reporter and political commentator, but also a religious figure and educator. Mr. Ye was born in Hangzhou in the thirty-second year of Guangxu (1906), and at the age of seventeen, he traveled across the ocean to study in the United States. After sixteen years, he obtained a Master of Arts in Political Science from Indiana University and returned to China. In addition to working as a reporter for the Shen Bao, he also served as a professor at Fudan University. The subjects he taught were sociology and anthropology, which seemed very inconsistent with his age. At that time, he was only twenty-one years old and was the youngest professor at Fudan University. Mixed in with a group of students, it was almost impossible to tell who was a student and who was a professor. Mr. Ye was a young man who "came out early," and perhaps the reason why he failed to enjoy his old age was because he made his debut too early!

Mr. Ye had a religious enthusiasm early on, and he was most likely to gain the love of students when he was with young students. According to Mr. Ye himself, the most gratifying thing in his life was in the twenty-first year of the Republic (1932), when there was a student movement at China Public School, and the students rose up against Professor Luo Longji, forcing him to resign as the director of the Department of Political Economy. At that time, the vice president, Mr. Pan Gongzhan, found it difficult to decide on a successor, and finally hired Mr. Ye to succeed him. Mr. Ye was only twenty-seven years old at the time, but after he arrived at the school, the student movement subsided. Last year, when the Shanghai student movement was in a state of chaos, Mr. Ye often talked about how he dealt with students when he was in China Public School. Although students are different now than they were in the past, he was indeed able to deal with students in a way that was superior to others. Therefore, on the eve of his death, some people still advocated inviting Mr. Ye to go to the north to serve as the president of a certain university.
