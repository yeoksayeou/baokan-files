### Zhang Fuyun Visits the Hong Kong Governor: Discussing the Implementation of the Sino-British Economic Agreement

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 24th] According to a Hong Kong dispatch: Zhang Fuyun visited the Hong Kong Governor on the 24th. The date for the exchange of documents for the Sino-Hong Kong agreement is expected to be next week, as the Hong Kong side completes all legislative procedures. The Kowloon Customs, responsible for implementation, has been extremely busy preparing in recent days. The Customs held a tea party on the 24th to welcome Zhang and listen to his instructions on anti-smuggling between China and Hong Kong.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 24th] Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration, who was sent to Hong Kong to negotiate the implementation of the Sino-British Economic Agreement with the local government, formally visited Hong Kong Governor Grantham's secretary, McDonald, on the morning of the 24th, accompanied by Guo Dehua, Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Guangdong and Guangxi. The Governor hosted a banquet at noon at the Hong Kong Government House. Zhang's mission here is because, after our group implemented currency reform, it is urgently necessary to consult with the Hong Kong authorities to thoroughly implement the "practical measures" of the Sino-British Economic Agreement, in order to stop smuggling and other possible loopholes. Although the Sino-Hong Kong Economic Agreement was signed as early as January this year, with a valid period of only one year, it has been delayed until now because the Hong Kong Legislative Council has been slow to approve it.

### Regarding the Examination of Chinese Deposits: Hong Kong Authorities Say They Have Not Yet Been Contacted by Our Side

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 23rd] Hong Kong's Acting Financial Secretary, Clark, and Director of Imports and Exports, Shimshwa, said at a press conference on the 23rd that they could not comment on rumors that the deposits of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong banks would be examined. They said that, as far as they knew, the Chinese government had not yet contacted the Hong Kong government about this matter. Shimshwa confirmed that the new regulations limiting the carrying of Gold Yuan into and out of Hong Kong were part of the Sino-British Financial Agreement of October 1947. Clark explained that the "Defense of a Financial" ordinance only approves 20 banks to operate Gold Yuan telegraphic transfer business. Other unapproved banks are regulated by banking regulations, which are also part of the Sino-British Agreement. Shimshwa said that the purpose of these two regulations is to help the Chinese government stabilize its currency. He said, "This is in the interest of both China and Hong Kong." He also said, "China should be a major supplier and trading country in the world market. Stability in China leads to prosperity, and prosperity in China leads to prosperity in Hong Kong."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] In the case of leaking currency reform secrets, the Capital District Prosecutor's Office summoned Zhao Guanhou, acting chief secretary of the Ministry of Finance. At around 9:00 AM on the 24th, Tian Jihou, the prosecutor in charge of the case, issued a temporary warrant to question Tao Qiming at the detention center in the Baby Bridge District Court.

Tao claimed that he did not know, and did not answer the point about taking the train. This was completely contrary to his testimony during the grueling interrogation at the Capital Police Department.

### Fighting Intensifies Around Jinan: Major Strongholds Are Still Firmly Defended by the National Army: Wang Shuming Flies to Jinan Again to Direct Operations from the Air

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 24th] The war outside Jinan is becoming increasingly fierce. The Ninth and Thirteenth Columns of bandits on the southeastern outskirts, with about five regiments of troops, attacked Yonggumen yesterday under the cover of eight armored vehicles. The national army annihilated part of the bandits who broke in. The remnants of the bandits are still confronting us outside Yonggumen. Part of the Third Column of bandits in the southwest corner, under the cover of artillery fire, attempted to break into the city. The national army fought back bravely, and the bandits' momentum was slightly restrained. A small number of bandits harassed Hanshiqiao and Baotuquan. The commercial port has entered a state of mixed warfare. The bandits suffered heavy casualties, but they still used human wave tactics, not hesitating to make large sacrifices, using corpses as cover, and attacking the city fiercely. Major strongholds such as Qilu University, Qianfoshan Temple, and Ma'anshan are still firmly defended by the national army.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 24th Afternoon] The bandits who are fighting fiercely with us around the Yonggumen city wall are repeatedly engaging in hand-to-hand combat.

### Full Text of Foreign Minister Wang’s Speech at the Paris United Nations General Assembly

[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on the 24th. The full text is as follows:

Before speaking, I would first like to express, on behalf of my delegation, our gratitude for France’s gracious hospitality. Whether in terms of material comfort or spiritual inspiration, it is hard to find a place as suitable for our deliberations as Paris. France has made great contributions to the evolution of mankind, and the world is still in dire need of such contributions. The wise people of France, with their exceptional abilities, can certainly shoulder this responsibility. The members of the Chinese delegation are very pleased to be in France.

From the perspective of an Asian country representative, I acknowledge that the United Nations has made considerable progress compared to the former League of Nations in representing the peoples of the Far East and in actively addressing various issues in this vast region. However, I must frankly state that the representation of Asia and the Far East in the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council is still insufficient. Within these two bodies, China’s voice is the sole voice of the nations east of the Suez. In the past year, I have been pleased to observe that many issues in the Asian Far East region have received fair attention in the various organs of the United Nations. The issues to which I have paid particular attention include the independence of Korea, the dispute in the Dutch East Indies, and the work of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. Mr. Chairman, regarding these issues, I would like to express China’s satisfaction with the good work that has been done. Given that the India and Pakistan Mediation Committee is just beginning its important task, I do not wish to comment. India and Pakistan are both friends and neighbors of China, and major members of the Security Council. China deeply hopes that the difficulties between the two sides can be resolved through the assistance of the United Nations, in a spirit of reconciliation, and that the friendship between the two countries can be enhanced.

Independence of Korea

(1) Regarding the issue of Korean independence, this General Assembly should continue to pay attention to the independence of Korea. The difficult work of the United Nations Commission on Korea is made even more difficult by the unwillingness of the Soviet occupation forces in North Korea to cooperate. However, the delegation has completed the free and democratic elections in South Korea under such uncooperative circumstances, making a significant contribution. Regardless of the various opinions on the former Japanese colonial rule in Korea, one thing can be asserted: that the regime did not make every effort to prepare Koreans for an independent and democratic life. The general elections in South Korea this spring were the first opportunity for Koreans to express their wishes for the destiny of their country. On May 10, election day, over ninety percent of registered voters went to the polls. There is no doubt that the Korean people have expressed their desire and readiness for freedom and autonomy. The judgment of the United Nations Commission on Korea itself is extremely fair and authoritative regarding the final results of the election. I am particularly pleased with the following passage from the report submitted by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to this General Assembly on the Korean issue:

On June 25, 1948, the United Nations Commission on Korea decided to reiterate its opinion as follows: The elections of May 10, 1948, were a valid expression of the free will of the electorate in the areas of Korea accessible to the Commission, which constituted about two-thirds of the population of Korea.

After the May 10 election, the Korean people established their provisional government, which the Chinese government believes should be granted de facto recognition. We are pleased to note that the governments of the United States and the Philippines have also granted de facto recognition. However, the work of the United Nations Commission on Korea is not yet complete. The delegation’s assistance efforts have not extended to North Korea, and the delegation has not been able to send observers to the area north of the 38th parallel. Korea is still a divided Korea. The future of Korea is of great importance to the peace and prosperity of the Far East and the world. The Korean people, with their long culture, their habits of diligence and thrift, and their unanimous dedication to peace, should not only gain independence and unification, but, after independence and unification, they should also be able to contribute to the stability of the Far East. I urge the General Assembly not to relax its efforts on the issue of Korean independence. We must move forward so that the Korean people can achieve complete unification and independence. The Chinese government will do its best to cooperate with other member states to achieve this goal. We have no ambition in Korea. The more solid and prosperous Korea's independence is, the better it will be for China.

The Indonesian Question

(2) Regarding the Indonesian question, I believe that the Security Council and its Mediation Committee deserve the gratitude of the United Nations for their handling of the Indonesian question. We have prevented war and have worked together to maintain a ceasefire without major unfortunate incidents occurring. We have also paved the way for a final settlement between the Dutch government and the Indonesian Republic government. The Dutch and Indonesian sides have agreed to form a joint organization on an equal footing. Mr. Chairman, I would like to express my congratulations on the agreement reached by both parties on this great principle. In implementing the Renville Agreement, serious difficulties have arisen, mainly in procedural matters. The Mediation Committee’s insistence on inflexible regulations has exacerbated the difficulties. I do not wish to overlook future difficulties, but I cannot imagine that any leader on either side would allow procedural issues to prevent the realization of the goal of freedom and democracy. I would like to make two more observations on this matter. Her Majesty Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands told the people of the world years ago that colonialism had ended. Her Majesty’s words accurately summarized the spirit of this era. I dare to add a note here: the aspirations of nations seeking freedom must be recognized by all countries in the world. Only by recognizing the right of self-determination of all nations can we hope that nationalism will not become abnormal and exaggerated, or become anti-international. This also forms my second observation. We, the Chinese people, are pleased that Indonesia will achieve its political goals. I hope that Indonesia's political freedom will be followed by orderly progress, which will be encouraged by its spirit of cooperation with its neighbors and distant friends, especially with the Netherlands, because there must remain many common relationships between the Netherlands and Indonesia (continued on page 3)

Editorial

### Looking to the North at the Flames of War!

The main battle in the Jinan area, which the whole country is watching, has been going on for nine days now! The communist bandits are adopting "human wave tactics," relying on their concentrated forces to advance towards the urban area step by step. Our defending commander, General Wang Yaowu, though his forces are less than a third of the bandit army, is in high morale and continues to hold the core area, fighting to the death, determined to coexist with Jinan City. This manifestation of "determination to fight to the death" is truly moving to Heaven and earth. Considering the overall war situation, the gains and losses of one city or one place need not be overemphasized. However, Jinan is strategically located between the two major strongholds of Tianjin and Xuzhou, and is also the junction of the Tianjin-Pukou and Jiaoji Railways. It can be said to control the throat of our country's north-south transportation, making it a must-contend place for military strategists. Precisely because of this, the gains and losses of Jinan are not comparable to ordinary towns. This is also why the whole country is paying close attention to the development of the Jinan battle. As the Shandong legislators stated in their petition to the President: "Jinan is not only Jinan of Shandong, but is actually closely related to Xuzhou and the capital. In any case, the government should do its best to ensure its safety."

Although we also advocate that the central government should quickly send troops to aid and defend this historically famous city and important town, we believe that the military authorities should see through the communist bandits' "autumn offensive." They should make an overall plan for the battles in the Northeast, North China, and the Jinan area, and should not treat the symptoms without addressing the root cause, sending elite troops east and west, tiring themselves out, or falling for the communist bandits' trick of attacking in the east while striking in the west. This time, the communist bandits have gathered a large army of no less than 300,000 men to attack the Jinan area, willing to bet everything, seemingly determined to take Jinan. However, we believe that the purpose of the communist bandits' entire battle plan is not entirely in Jinan, and their greatest ambition is in the Northeast and North China. Military observers generally say that the communist bandits' "autumn offensive" is not only military, but also political, and even economic.

Now is the time when autumn crops are ripe and new grains are harvested. This year, the Northeast and North China are uniquely blessed by the heavens, with favorable weather, which can be called "a year of great harvest." In the vast fields, there is now a scene of "tall sorghum, fragrant soybeans." This is a great temptation for the communist bandits. Our side has long used troops to protect and assist farmers in "quick harvesting, quick transportation, quick threshing, and quick storage" in various places. This is like a thorn in the back for the communist bandits, forcing them to launch the "autumn offensive" in advance. The communist bandits not only want to protect their own autumn harvest, but also want to destroy the national army's autumn harvest. The sufficiency of military rations is often a key factor in determining victory or defeat. Moreover, the communist bandits' purpose in creating chaos is to create economic panic in the country in order to drag down the National Government and realize their ambition to seize power. In the past three years, after each large-scale battle, the communist bandits may not have achieved much militarily, but they have ultimately considered it a great gain to stimulate rising prices in the government-controlled areas. Now that the government has implemented currency reform and achieved initial success, not only have prices stabilized, but also people's hearts are at ease. The communist bandits will naturally launch a military offensive to create unrest and panic in the government-controlled areas. This is the real purpose of the communist bandits' autumn offensive. Some say that the communist bandits' offensive is to strike at the "gold yuan," which also seems to be an insightful comment.

Looking to the north at the flames of war, the communist bandits' "autumn offensive" began on the 11th of this month in western Liaoning, attempting to disrupt the Jin-Yu railway traffic. Then, the Luan-Dong war broke out again, and the communist bandits occupied Changli on the 14th. The Jinan battle became tense on the 17th. Today marks half a month, and its purpose and ambition have long been exposed. In the Northeast, the communist bandits first seek to isolate Jinzhou, and then attempt to occupy Shenyang and Changchun without a fight, swallowing the entire Northeast. In North China, the communist bandits are starting from Luan-Dong, and the Shunyi-Sanhe battle is an attempt to threaten Peiping and Tianjin. In Shandong, they believe that occupying Jinan can prevent the national army from reinforcing North China. In this way, they are using military means to achieve their political ambitions. Mao Zedong once said that after the "autumn offensive," he could choose a place in North China to convene a "new political consultative conference" and organize a "North China People's Government." This is excellent proof. As for why the communist bandits are so eager to "succeed"? This question can only be explained from the international situation. Communist forces are steadily advancing towards Western Europe. The inability to resolve the Berlin crisis shows the tension between the Soviet Union and Western democracies. But the Soviet Union also wants to take advantage of the fact that Western countries are focusing on Europe and attempt to take action in Asia at the same time. Southeast Asia has already begun to move, but the key to Asia is China. If the CCP "succeeds" (?), Southeast Asia can proceed smoothly without any more problems. The New York World Journal has long pointed out the communist bandits' conspiracy in its comments on the Far East situation, which can be said to be insightful.

In short, we first ask the military authorities to quickly formulate a major plan, immediately change from passive to active in military affairs, and crush the communist bandits' "autumn offensive." Secondly, we hope that the people in the rear will concentrate their will, practice thrift and build the country, and resolutely support the government's economic reform plan. Even if the communist bandits' "autumn offensive" has some achievements militarily, and there are some gains and losses in one city or one place, we should still maintain our faith, not waver, and not disturb ourselves, so that the communist bandits cannot achieve their political and economic goals in this "autumn offensive"!

[Our Correspondent, Hangzhou, 24th] Zhejiang Chairman Chen Yi received our reporter alone and talked about the political situation in Zhejiang. He said that bandits with guns can be eliminated within three months, and sporadic bandits can also disappear after the economic plan is realized. The pacification expenses were originally collected individually by each county, but now they are collected and disbursed as a whole, which can make the burden fair, and the number of items has been reduced, so it is imperative.

Relevant agencies are limited to submit written opinions before the 29th, and then the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will organize them and make a final decision.

### Korean, Greek, and Veto Issues: The Soviet Union Again Requests Removal from the Agenda; Representatives of Various Countries at the United Nations General Assembly Call for Peace

[News Agency Report] Paris, 24th - Broadcast: During this morning's session of the United Nations General Assembly, the representative of Uruguay spoke first, urging the UNGA to concentrate greater efforts on establishing international law and order. The representative of South Africa spoke, criticizing the United Nations for failing to adhere to the spirit of the Charter and warned the United Nations not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries; otherwise, South Africa would withdraw from the United Nations. The representative of Denmark pointed out that the German refugees on its border endangered its security, and then the Chairman, Evatt, announced a recess. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang and the representative of Myanmar also attended and delivered speeches.

Another dispatch: Following yesterday's failure in the General Committee, the Soviet representative Malik today reiterated his request in the General Assembly, stating that three types of issues should not be included on the agenda: the veto power for admitting new members, the issues of Greece and Korea, and the accusation against the Soviet Union for violating human rights. Malik stated that discussing such issues would not benefit the United Nations in any way and would inevitably lead the United Nations to repeat the mistakes of the former League of Nations.

[Associated Press, Paris, 24th] The United Nations General Assembly on the 24th heard a call to declare war illegal. The call was issued by the Chief Representative of Myanmar, Maung Hla, and in fact, this is a revival of the Briand-Kellogg Pact (French Foreign Minister and US Secretary of State) after the First World War, but the pact has long since died a natural death. Maung Hla requested that the current General Assembly should first discuss ways to safeguard world peace. "We should first pass a resolution reiterating the principles of the preamble to the United Nations Charter, namely that the member states are attending the third session of the UNGA with the sincere hope for peace and will never go to war with other countries under any circumstances." When the General Assembly began at 10:45 AM, the representatives of 58 countries were trembling due to the threat of war. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union will soon issue two important documents, which may determine the long-term history of the UNGA and the world. These two are the policy speech of the Soviet Chief Representative Vyshinsky and the Soviet reply to the Western powers' new note on the Berlin crisis. If the Kremlin's reply is unsatisfactory, and Vyshinsky once again launches into a tirade, then the hope of improving the international situation will vanish.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] A total of six people spoke at the UNGA on the 23rd. The most important was US Secretary of State Marshall, whose firm and moderate tone won general sympathy. The other speakers all firmly maintained that the most important task of the United Nations was to permanently banish the monster of war, and they outlined their concepts of a just world political structure in different ways. The Syrian representative, Khoury, said that he advocated opening the doors of the United Nations wide to accommodate all sovereign states and hoped that the General Assembly could overcome the obstacles placed by the Security Council in this regard. The Venezuelan representative expressed extreme regret at the decline of political morality in the post-war world, saying that this only revived past animosities and discrimination. The Egyptian representative mentioned the Palestine issue, questioning the transplantation of hundreds of thousands of foreign people to Palestine as masters of the holy land, and the impact of this will threaten the security of the entire world.

### Marshall and Bevin Meet; Reach Agreement on the Next Steps Regarding the Berlin Issue; Smith Summoned Back to Washington for Consultations

[Associated Press, Paris, 24th] US Secretary of State Marshall met with British Foreign Secretary Bevin again on the 24th to discuss the Berlin crisis. This was their first meeting since Bevin returned to London to attend an emergency meeting and then returned here. In London, Bevin made a foreign policy statement in the House of Commons, saying that if the Berlin airlift still had to be maintained in the winter, the three Western powers were in complete agreement on the next steps. Marshall and Bevin met in the morning, so Marshall was late for the UNGA meeting. British and American envoys Smith and Robertson, who presided over the Moscow talks, were also present at the meeting between the British and American foreign ministers, which is noteworthy.

[Associated Press, Paris, 23rd] British representative Shawcross's response to reporters' inquiries showed that if the three powers were still dissatisfied with the Soviet Union's reply, they intended to submit the Berlin issue to the United Nations.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith flew to Washington tonight, seemingly to report the situation of the Moscow talks to Acting Secretary of State Lovett and Secretary of Defense Forrestal, or perhaps to meet with Dewey and other key Republicans.

### Moscow Radio Criticizes Marshall's Speech

[Associated Press, London, 24th] Moscow Radio on the 24th attacked Marshall's speech at the UNGA, believing it was deliberately intended to influence the US elections in November. The broadcast stated, "The US State Department hopes to dazzle American voters with a rosy diplomatic policy, but the essence of this policy cannot deceive anyone." The broadcast also criticized the Filipino representative's appeal as "completely hypocritical, because the Philippine delegation is merely a faithful executor of Washington's policies and has no independent action to speak of."

### Balkan Committee Report Submitted to the UNGA

Yugoslav Pressure on Greece Decreases

[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] The State Department released a report on the 23rd, for the first time suggesting that after Prime Minister Tito's break with the Cominform, the pressure on Greece from the communists may have decreased. The State Department also released the report of the United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans, which stated that in recent months, the evidence of the Greek guerrillas receiving assistance from Yugoslavia has also decreased. This report covers the period from June 17 to September 10 and will be submitted to the UNGA. The report also recommends that the United Nations issue a serious warning to Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia that if they continue to assist the Greek guerrillas, it will endanger the peace of the Balkans.

### General Committee Continues to Meet; Main Agenda of the General Assembly Agreed Upon; Issues of the Holy Land and Italian Colonies Included

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] The United Nations General Committee agreed on the agenda of the General Assembly this afternoon, which includes the former Italian colonies, Palestine, the establishment of a United Nations guard force, and smaller issues such as human rights and freedom of information. After the decision, the initial study of each item on the agenda was completed, and the work was distributed to the six standing committees according to the nature of which committee should handle each item. With the exception of human rights and freedom of information, the General Committee refused to establish any new committees. The General Committee completed its work very quickly today, clearing the way for constructive work.

### British Defense Minister Announces Troop Strength Plan

[Associated Press, London, 3rd] British Secretary of War Shinwell told the House of Commons on the 23rd that the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Western European alliance countries are conducting discussions on defense and strategy. Secretary of Defense Alexander reported that due to "unrest, riots, and disturbances around the world," the government is prepared to immediately establish British armed forces.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 23rd] British Secretary of Defense Alexander declared in the House of Commons today that as a result of the British government delaying demobilization, it would be able to maintain a troop strength of 825,000 on January 1 next year, which will be reduced to 790,000 on April 1, otherwise it would be 716,000. The government may recall some reservists to active duty, and the general mobilization plan is currently under preparation. He also stated that the production of jet fighters, armored materials, and automatic weapons will be doubled. This plan was actually prompted by the current situation and was not caused by panic.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 23rd] Officials announced that the government has decided to increase the number of naval reservists from 14,000 to 75,000, in addition to the 17,000 reservists who have already joined the Royal Fleet.

[Associated Press, Canberra, 23rd] Australia has recently accepted a mission to develop Australia into the main supply base in the Pacific under the British United Kingdom defense plan.

### After Indonesian Government Forces Launched an Offensive, Fierce Fighting Near the Outskirts of Madiun; The Communist Rebellion in Blitar City Has Been Suppressed

[Associated Press, Batavia, 24th] According to the Indonesian Republic's official news agency, Antara, on the 24th: Nologaten, 98 miles west of Madiun City, fell back into the hands of the communists after fierce fighting.

Amid the Republic's troops' advance on Madiun City, the Madiun City Communist Radio Station announced that martial law has been imposed in the communist area. At the same time, Radio Yogyakarta stated that the Communist Party had blown up the bridge west of Madiun City to impede the government's offensive. The radio also claimed that the Commander-in-Chief of the Republic's troops was confident of "liberating Madiun City in the earliest possible time." It is reported that ten senior Indonesian military officers have been removed from their positions for allegedly being involved in another communist coup.

### Full Text of Foreign Minister Wang's Speech at the United Nations General Assembly in Paris

Economic Work in Asia

〔Continued from Page One〕(3) Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. I would like to offer a few observations regarding the work of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. Among the countless subsidiary bodies of the United Nations, the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, under the Economic and Social Council, holds a unique and prominent position. This is because its task is to promote the economic progress of half the human population in Asia and the Far East. Mr. Chairman, I personally and my government dare to say that our neighbors all aspire to the benefits of modern science and technology. Poverty is a significant issue in Asia and the Far East. If there is a war worth fighting in the world, it must be the war against scarcity. The primary responsibility for economic progress in Asia and the Far East naturally rests with the governments and peoples of the region. However, industrially advanced countries can provide substantial assistance. Mr. Chairman, I do not intend to elaborate on the economic problems of Asia and the Far East during this general debate in the General Assembly. Instead, I wish to take this opportunity to state the guiding principles for addressing such a problem. We hope that economic development in Asia can be accelerated through international cooperation, but we believe that external countries must not interfere with the socio-economic systems that nations voluntarily accept and develop. There is no pre-fabricated social system anywhere in the world that can be directly imported into Asia. We now reserve our own rights and will fight to preserve the right to develop a social system that meets our needs and the ideals of our social justice. The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East has held three meetings. We believe that the work of the Commission, in essence, is progressing gradually. The Commission must first collect data, but we hope that it will not become an academic institution. The Commission must hold meetings and adopt resolutions, and we hope that the resolutions will not become mere formalities. At its recent meeting in India, the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East recommended the establishment of a Flood Control Bureau. The Economic and Social Council, recognizing the extreme importance and urgency of the flood control issue that affects the lives of millions of people in the major river basins of Asia and the Far East, has also approved its establishment. I am delighted by this. In this important area of economic improvement, any constructive, centralized, and cooperative effort will immediately gain the attention and support of the people of Asia. We therefore hope that this work will begin as soon as possible. This type of work could serve as a good example of the United Nations promoting constructive cooperation in administrative matters.

Economic and Social Progress

(4) Economic and Social Council. In reviewing the work of the regional commissions of the Economic and Social Council, I would like to briefly describe the general progress of the Economic and Social Council itself. Regarding the Economic and Social Council's multifaceted activities, I would particularly like to emphasize two of its courageous endeavors. One is to eliminate international trade barriers, and the other is to promote freedom of world news. Both of these efforts have achieved significant success. One has already signed an agreement, and one has established a draft. Although China's economic development and domestic political situation have not progressed and stabilized as hoped, its firm determination to support such constructive efforts by the United Nations has never lagged behind others. Mr. Chairman, the Chinese delegation believes that in order to promote the work of the Economic and Social Council, member states must always be prepared to place their own national considerations below the needs of international cooperation.

The Veto Issue

(5) The Veto Issue. The Chinese delegation is pleased to note that the Standing Committee, which the General Assembly instructed at its last session to study the veto issue, has submitted a well-researched and completed report. In this regard, the United Nations General Assembly should consider the recommendations of the Standing Committee. The Standing Committee has listed several possible resolutions of the Council that it believes are undoubtedly procedural in nature. Therefore, they should not be subject to the veto. It has also listed several matters that it believes are less related to politics. Therefore, if the permanent members of the Security Council can agree, they can be placed outside the scope of the unanimity rule. The Committee has also suggested regulations that it believes the permanent members of the Security Council should normally adhere to when using the veto. Some of these measures recommended by the Standing Committee appear to be very helpful in resolving difficult issues. The Chinese government believes that the veto power stipulated in the United Nations Charter is intended to ensure that every substantive decision made by the Security Council has the highest degree of authority. The main purpose of stipulating the veto is to enhance the prestige of the United Nations, not to diminish it. However, if the veto is abused, the main organs of the United Nations may fall into paralysis. Therefore, the permanent members of the Security Council should be cautious in exercising the veto and should respect the reasonable interpretations of the provisions of the United Nations Charter, which may impose restrictions on the scope of the power's use.

Universal Peace

(6) The Issue of Universal Peace. Before concluding this speech, I would like to say a few words about the issue of universal peace. Maintaining peace is clearly not something that can be accomplished by a single effort or a single institution. War and peace are constituted by multifaceted forces on many fronts. This issue is as old as history. Politics, economics, and strategy have all had a significant impact on it. In China's recorded history of three thousand years, there have been various experiences with the issues of war and peace. China has sometimes been a victorious conqueror and has also sometimes been conquered by other nations. However, in our long experience, we have never committed the crime of imposing our own ideas on others. We have always allowed other peoples to maintain their religious customs and their economic and political systems. If other nations recognize the value of Chinese culture and wish to adopt it, we welcome them. However, we have never intended to impose this way of life on others. Mr. Chairman, the main reason I raise this issue is that one of the main points of the peace issue we face today is the conflict of such ideas. Perhaps, except for the period of the Thirty Years' War in Europe, I cannot recall a time in history when the relations between countries were so complex and intricate due to ideological conflicts as they are today. In general discussions about this conflict, there is a misconception that the people of the world must choose between communism and capitalism. In fact, there are other possibilities. For example, China believes in the principles of what the founder of the Republic of China called the Principle of People's Livelihood, which is different from both communism and capitalism. For any country to impose an idea on another country in any way is an impossible and dangerous thing. We must relearn in the mid-twentieth century what the people of Europe learned in the mid-seventeenth century, namely, tolerance. Differences between churches still exist, and there are various genuine branches that people can evaluate according to their own thinking. However, civilized society has recognized that people can worship their God in different ways. No matter who believes in what religion in their own way, they must also respect the religious customs of others. What Europeans learned about religion at the cost of the Thirty Years' War, we should also learn about economic and social systems without going through a Thirty Years' War. This does not mean that the world cannot have a common belief. In fact, we must uphold the basic idea of the United Nations Charter, in which we should all believe. We should all have faith in this. However, apart from this, we must all practice tolerance. If world peace is to be maintained, the current ideological war must be replaced by tolerance. At the same time, we should make every effort to strengthen the authority of the United Nations, whose constitution we have solemnly accepted and signed. Mr. Chairman, I would like to state one more point here. If any member of the Security Council, especially a permanent member, begins to feel satisfied with a weak United Nations, then at that moment, this country is already disloyal to world peace or to itself. I said at the Second General Assembly of the United Nations that the United Nations had reached a stage where its future development, or even its existence, was precarious. The situation in the past year has not alleviated our anxiety. If anything, it can be said that the current situation seems even more serious than a year ago. Today, as we gather, the major aspects of the world situation are not better than they were in 1939. Therefore, our responsibility to uphold world peace is heavier and more urgent than at the last meeting. Only if we are more tolerant of each other and thoroughly understand our responsibilities under the Charter can we hope that all nations will one day be truly united. China's determination and contribution to this great task will never lag behind others. (End)

### Wang Chunzhe, the First Person Executed for Disrupting Financial Order, Was Shot Yesterday; Suicide Note Accuses Zheng Jiayu of Going Scot-Free

〔Reported by This Newspaper〕Wang Chunzhe, manager of the Lin Wang Company, the first person to be severely punished for the crime of disrupting financial order, was executed by a special criminal court yesterday.

After being sentenced to capital punishment by the Special Criminal Court on September 3 of this year, Wang Chunzhe applied to the Central Special Criminal Court in the capital for a retrial. On the 22nd, the Central Court ruled to uphold the death sentence. On the 23rd, a special envoy arrived in Shanghai to deliver the judgment and execution order to the Special Court in this city. The main text of the judgment reads: "The original judgment regarding Wang Chunzhe is revoked. Wang Chunzhe is sentenced to death for jointly and continuously intending to disrupt the financial order for the purpose of harming the suppression of rebellion, and is sentenced to deprivation of civil rights for life. The parts of the judgment concerning Lin Tongshi and Zheng Ligong, which found them not guilty, are approved." The Special Court brought Wang from the detention center at 1:30 PM yesterday. Wang's face was pale, and he wore a finely checkered gauze short shirt and pants, and yellow leather shoes. Seeing the heavily armed guards, he knew his death was near, but his attitude remained calm. He was first taken to the waiting room. At 1:40 PM, Prosecutor Li Yulong took the bench and ordered Wang to be brought to the court. He first asked about Wang's age and place of birth. Wang said, "I am 36 years old and from Shantou, Guangdong." Prosecutor Li then informed him that the Central Special Criminal Court had sentenced him to death and ordered his execution. He asked, "Do you have any last words?" Wang immediately shouted that he was unjustly killed, and that all black market gold and foreign exchange transactions were done by Zheng Jiayu, who is abroad and unaware of the situation.

### Advising His Old Mother Not to Resent His Cousin

He then asked for paper and pen and wrote two suicide notes. One was addressed to his mother: "Mother: Don't grieve when you hear that I have been executed. Life is but a few decades, and everyone must die eventually. However, my death is too unjust. The main culprit is actually my cousin, Zheng Jiayu. He took my cash and is going scot-free. Tell him to commit suicide as soon as possible to atone for his sins and avoid harming others. As for my property in Shanghai, please ask my nephew Kai and my second brother to settle it and give it all to you. My eldest sister and younger brothers have been running around in Shanghai for my sake, and I am sincerely grateful. But my fate is such that it cannot be reversed by human effort. Finally, what I want to tell the world is that I have no regrets even in death, because I have not wronged the country or any individual. Only the country has wronged me. My efforts to export foreign exchange to the country have not been recognized at all. The things that others have done, the crimes they have committed, have all been put on my shoulders. At most, I was just negligent in using people.

Please also ask my nephew Kai to comfort all my girlfriends and ask them not to be sad. There are plenty of good men in the world. I wish you good health. Your unfilial son, Chunzhe."

### Entrusting His Nephew to Console His Girlfriends

The other note was addressed to his nephew Wang Zhongkai: "Kai: Please settle my property and give 10,000 gold yuan to Ya Ling (note: his girlfriend; Wang was not married). I wish you success in your studies. Zhe." After writing the notes, he prepared for execution. Wang requested an anesthetic injection, but Prosecutor Li told him that there was no such equipment and gave him a bowl of sorghum liquor. Wang drank it all. At 2:10 PM, he was taken to the execution ground behind the Shanghai Prison, where he was shot. The bullet entered the back of his head and exited from the right side of his nose.

### His Nephew Rushed to Claim the Body and Prepare for the Funeral

Afterwards, Wang's nephew Zhongkai heard the news and rushed to the scene (Zhongkai is a junior in the Department of Business Administration at the National Shanghai College of Commerce). He called the International Funeral Home, and the body was taken away around 5 PM.

### Shanghai Alumni Association of the National Assembly to Hold First Meeting of Officers Today

### Chiang Ching-kuo Invites Representatives from the Industrial Sector to Discuss Maintaining Price Controls with Increased Production as the Prerequisite; Expresses Approval for Their Support of the Policy

〔Reported by This Newspaper〕Supervisor Chiang Ching-kuo invited representatives from the labor sector in this city for a discussion at 10 AM yesterday. Those invited and present included Shui Xiangyun, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, Liang Yongzhang, Fan Caiqui, Chen Boliang, Fang Rusheng, Zhao Shuqing, Zhu Shanyuan, Su Zhijian, and more than ten others, accompanied by Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau. Supervisor Chiang first delivered a speech, praising the workers as the true producers of society. He stated that maintaining price controls currently requires increased production as a prerequisite, and that only through cooperation between labor and management can production be increased. He expressed his satisfaction that the price control policy has received strong support from the labor sector, and he believes that once the currency stabilizes, the workers' problems can be resolved reasonably and appropriately. After Chiang's speech, the representatives present spoke enthusiastically. Their main points can be summarized as follows: (1) They hoped to abolish the discount on the cost of living index when calculating wages. (2) The raw material problem in the factories of this city is serious. The number of workers unemployed due to the lack of raw materials has exceeded two thousand. The knitting industry is suffering from the impact on production due to the lack of supply of 32-count cotton yarn. The cotton textile industry also feels the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. The silk weaving industry has an irrational allocation of raw materials, with those who need them not being allocated and those who do not need them being over-allocated, which needs to be improved. (3) Freezing workers' income according to the August 19th price controls is clearly detrimental to the workers, and they ask the authorities to pay attention to this fact. (4) The most threatening factor to the lives of workers at present is the rising price of vegetables, which is difficult to report one by one. Supervisor Chiang at the time gave a sincere reply to the opinions of the representatives, stating that "Under the August 19th price controls, some people are indeed suffering, but the price control policy itself is not wrong. Fortunately, this is currently a transitional period, and many problems will eventually have a reasonable solution in the future. If there are any changes at present, it is feared that it will affect the whole situation." The discussion ended at 12:30 PM.

### Measures to Adjust Industrial Raw Material Supply Are Likely Being Discussed; Yu Hongjun, Dai Yu, Qing Wen, Zi Hongjun, etc. Hosted a Banquet for Leaders of the Industrial and Financial Sectors Yesterday

〔Reported by This Newspaper〕Yu Hongjun, Chiang Ching-kuo, and Liu Gongyun jointly hosted a large-scale banquet at the Central Bank at 7 PM last night for leading figures from the industrial and financial sectors in this city. Xu Jiqing, Li Ming, Du Yuesheng, Wu Yunxu, Jie Yunzhang, Liu Hongsheng, Jin Runxiang, Hu Xiyuan, Liu Ji, Pan Shihao, Hu Boxiang, Hong Nianzu, Yang Guanbei, Wang Qiyu, and others attended. Mayor Wu, Director Wu, and heads of various institutions of the Material Supply Bureau and the Transportation Control Commission were also invited to attend. The discussions during the banquet focused on the future supply of industrial raw materials in this city. The hosts and guests agreed that Shanghai is a manufacturing center and needs to absorb industrial raw materials from various places. At present, the prices of raw materials in other places are higher than in Shanghai. In the future, the management agencies will formulate all practical measures to adjust raw materials to maintain the smooth progress of industrial production in this city. To strengthen efficiency, the various industry associations will closely liaise to strengthen the joint allocation and sale of raw materials and the joint sale of finished products from various factories.

### No Suspension of Work or Reduction of Work Allowed

Supervisor Chiang also stated on the spot that, in order to increase production, factories must not suspend work or reduce work without reason. The industrial figures present at the time replied that wages would be paid as usual during the period of work suspension or reduction, so factories would never intentionally suspend work or reduce work. The phenomenon of work reduction and suspension has its objective reasons and needs the assistance of the management authorities to resolve it. The banquet ended around 10 PM.

### Encouraging Party Member Vendors to Set an Example

〔Reported by This Newspaper〕Supervisor Chiang Ching-kuo stated that the recent crackdown on black markets and inspection of hoarding has achieved some results, but the supply situation in vegetable markets, which are closely related to people's livelihood, is still not ideal. Therefore, he took the opportunity of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters convening a discussion with cadres from the sixteen district party headquarters the other day, and specially visited the Municipal Party Headquarters to sincerely inquire about the current trading situation of over two hundred party member vendors in the egg, oil, chicken, meat, vegetable, and fish and seafood industries. Fang Zhi, chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Xie Renzhao, secretary-general, were also present.

Vendors from Various Industries Complained One After Another

Meat vendors stated that the wholesale price of pork was previously 4.8 yuan per catty, but has recently increased to 5.5 yuan. If sold at the controlled price of 7.2 yuan per catty, there is actually little profit because the wholesale price includes pig heads, skin, and bones. Therefore, they hoped to reasonably reduce the wholesale price. Egg vendors stated that the recent shortage of chicken eggs is due to cold storage companies collecting them for export sales. Therefore, they are currently only supplying more duck eggs, but they still hope that the authorities will find ways to open up sources of supply. Vegetable vendors also stated the difficulty of limited profits due to transportation costs and other reasons.

Resolving Various Difficulties

Supervisor Chiang immediately stated that he would find ways to help resolve the various difficulties faced by vendors. If wholesalers do not comply with the wholesale price and try their best to supply, they will be severely punished. However, the price controls of August 19th must be strictly adhered to, and supplies must be maximized. In particular, he hoped that party member vendors would set an example and have a demonstration effect, so that the daily lives of the general public would not be affected. Finally, Supervisor Chiang mentioned that when he inspected the various vegetable markets, he saw a lot of fish and shrimp, but very few buyers. When he asked the vendors the reason, he was told that it was because the controlled prices were too high. Chiang said that he would further investigate this and decide on appropriate measures.

More than 2,000 reams exceeded the three-month operating consumption. When the owner of the store, Zhang Xin Zhi, was summoned, he had already fled upon hearing the news. In addition to sealing up the paper at the store on the spot, the police bureau is also hunting down Zhang Xin Zhi.

### Merchants Be Warned: Wang Chunzhe Expressed His Hope That Merchants Would Be Alerted When Facing Execution

〔Reported by This Newspaper〕After writing two suicide notes, Wang Chunzhe turned to the surrounding news reporters and told them that the main culprit in this case was actually his cousin, Zheng Jiayu. He himself had only recently returned from the United States and was renting a room at No. 832, Youth Association Dormitory, Eight Immortals Bridge. He was 36 years old and not yet married, while Zheng Jiayu had fled to Hong Kong and was going scot-free. Because he was the manager, he could not escape responsibility. He hoped that all merchants would be alerted by his legal punishment and repent and reform. If so, he would feel that his death was worthwhile.

### Taichang Leather Store Reported for Exceeding the Price Limit by 40%

〔Reported by This Newspaper〕Yesterday, a certain person in the shoe industry went to the Taichang Leather Store on Beihai Road to purchase square-cut courtyard leather and discovered that the leather price was about 40% higher than the August 19th price limit. Although the price originally written on the leather had been erased, the traces were still discernible. He immediately reported to the police on duty, who took a clerk from the store, along with twenty-five pieces of square-cut leather that had been increased in price, to the Lao Zha Police Bureau. The bureau's economic section questioned the price increase and detained him, and will summon the owner of the store to be questioned and dealt with. According to the informant, since the authorities implemented price limits, the raw materials for shoe production have become difficult to obtain. For example, rubber soles are rarely sold on the market. He earnestly hopes that the management authorities will pay attention to this as soon as possible.

### Fuchang Flour Mill: A Large Quantity of Stored Flour Was Seized

〔Reported by This Newspaper〕The Fuyuan Flour Mill at No. 701, Meian Road, Jiangwan Town, was reported for hoarding a large quantity of flour. Yesterday, the Economic Police Brigade of the Police Bureau sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and, as a result, seized eight thousand bags of flour in the factory, of which more than four thousand bags were miscellaneous brands of flour. Upon reviewing the factory's accounts, only seventy-nine bags of bent powder had been sold from the end of August to the 15th of this month. The amount of stored flour greatly exceeded the amount required for three months of business, indicating a suspicion of hoarding for speculation. The manager of the factory, Lu Zhongfeng, was taken to the bureau for interrogation.

### The Case of the Shooting of the Gold and Foreign Exchange Broker is Transferred to a Special Court for Trial

〔Reported by This Newspaper〕The British national, Que Li A Que, who shot and killed gold and foreign exchange broker Yu Shengxiao, was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Shanghai Local Court on November 20, 1947, and sent to the Supreme Court for review. It is now learned that because the crime committed by the defendant Que Li A Que falls under Article 3, Paragraph 1, Item 7 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits, it is a case that should be dealt with in accordance with Article 7 of the Emergency Criminal Punishment Ordinance for Endangering National Security During the Period of Suppression of Rebellion. Therefore, the Supreme Court has ruled to transfer it to the Shanghai Special Criminal Court for trial.

### Shandong Natives in Shanghai Appeal to Ensure Jinan

### Suspicion of Black Market Gold and Dollar Transactions: Special Tribunal Interrogates Wei Boxiang; Claims Difference Between Head Office Fund Transfers and Loans; Two Foreign Nationals' Interrogation Postponed Due to Translator's Absence

[Our Report] Wei Boxiang, a legally designated broker of the Central Bank, his wife Yao Daiying, Russian national Meiji, and French national Aiqier were interrogated by the Special Criminal Tribunal at 10:00 AM yesterday on suspicion of engaging in black market gold and dollar transactions. After Judge Jiang Shanchu took his seat, he first summoned Meiji and Aiqier, stating, "Due to the change of translators in this court, and the new translator not yet being in place, the questioning regarding your cases will be temporarily postponed today." Subsequently, Wei and his wife were summoned, and the seized account books were given to Wei to review. The account books were all written in English. After Wei explained, they included correspondence with various banks and commission accounts for buying and selling US dollars. The judge asked if there were any other account books besides these. Wei replied that there were none; the office was very simple, and detailed accounts could be checked with various banks. He further stated that he did not engage in black market gold and dollar transactions at all because his usual brokerage business already kept him too busy. For example, on August 24th alone, there were over forty transactions. The price of US dollars fluctuated every minute, with a market that required constant attention to telephone quotations, leaving no time for black market gold and dollar transactions. However, he admitted to temporarily providing funds for banks or between banks and clients when they were unable to transfer funds for US dollar transactions. Judge Jiang questioned him about whether he was also running an underground bank. Wei immediately denied this, saying that such temporary fund transfers were permissible in the brokerage business, only lasting one or two days, and were different in nature from loans. After the interrogation, Wei's wife stated that she was in poor health and requested bail. Judge Jiang instructed that they would be notified if bail was granted. All four were returned to custody.

### Eight Clerks Dismissed; Requesting Explanation from Ministry

[Our Report] Xu Qiwu and eight other clerks from the District Procuratorate were collectively dismissed from their positions last month under an order from the Ministry of Judicial Administration.

However, to date, there has been no response from the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Xu and others hosted reporters yesterday afternoon, intending to release the materials they had collected to the newspapers as a means of appeal. Chief Prosecutor Zhang Yuquan of the District Procuratorate learned of this and dispatched Prosecutors Cao Hong and Lin Ye to persuade them. After discussions, Xu and others agreed to postpone the release of all the materials, but demanded that Chief Prosecutor Zhang immediately consult with the Ministry to explain the reasons for the dismissal, or to approve their reinstatement immediately. If reassignment was necessary, they requested that it be within the city.

### Shanghai Zhuang and Itinerant Merchants Must Report Materials

Second, constantly reflect on and improve oneself, be humble and sincere, and avoid superficiality and empty slogans. Third, have a firm and unyielding determination, endure hardship and be tireless, disregard slander and praise, and strive to complete this great and arduous social reform.

### Promoting Thrift; City Government Reduces Vehicles by Half

[Our Report] After the Committee on Economy determined measures to reduce the use of public and private automobiles, the City Government has already implemented them to promote the cause. From the end of this month, the number of vehicles will be reduced by half. Senior officials who each used one vehicle will now share one vehicle between two people. The City Government's noon shuttle bus has also been discontinued, but to facilitate employees, the Public Transportation Company will dispatch special buses to pick up and drop off employees at noon. The City Government's gasoline consumption has also been reduced three times, the first time in June, and the second time in August. In addition, the three vehicles originally used by Mayor Wu have been reduced to two, and these two vehicles must also be used to transport diplomatic envoys and important central government officials visiting Shanghai.

This will be thoroughly implemented once the government's official order arrives, and new licenses will no longer be issued.

### Police Officers from the Criminal Investigation Department on Trial for Corruption; Three Defendants Explain the Transfer of Funds; Manager of St. George's Hotel Absent, Hearing Adjourned

[Our Report] The case of Shao Guanrong, Shao Liang, and Zhu Bingxi, police officers from the Criminal Investigation Department of the Municipal Police Bureau, accused of corruption, was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Fang Xianghai of the Fourth Criminal Division of the District Court, with the three defendants brought from custody. Shao Guanrong stated that he was dispatched to western Shanghai and Pudong on September 4th to handle a case. When he returned home in the evening, his wife told him that Shao Liang had come to the house several times, leaving two taels of gold and 100 gold yuan, asking him to pass them on to Feng Xiushan, a clerk in the police bureau, without stating the purpose of the money. He did not know the plaintiff, Wu Gensheng, and Shao Liang was an old friend of many years. He knew nothing else.

Only Knew Repayment of Debt

Shao Liang (Public Relations Director of Tianfu Ding Nail Factory) stated that on the evening of September 3rd, Zhu Bingxi asked him if he had any close friends in the police bureau because his friend Wu Gensheng owed Feng Xiushan, a clerk in the police bureau, money and it was inconvenient for them to interact. He wanted Shao Liang to repay Feng on his behalf. Because he knew Shao Guanrong, he agreed, and visited Shao Guanrong's house several times on September 4th but did not find him. So he left two taels of gold and 100 gold yuan with Shao's wife, asking her to pass them on to Feng, only knowing that it was Wu Gensheng's repayment of Feng's debt, and knowing nothing else. Zhu Bingxi (Deputy Manager of Defeng Transportation Company) stated that he was sentenced to three months' imprisonment ten years ago for embezzlement and was an old friend of the plaintiff, Wu Gensheng. Wu had previously told him that Feng Qishan, the chief of the Criminal Investigation Section of the police bureau, was going to detain Wu in connection with a case. Wu feared being sued, so he entrusted Zhu, who was acquainted with Feng Qishan, to ask Feng Qishan if this was true. Feng Qishan replied that he did not know and instructed him to ask the police officer Feng Xiushan directly. Feng Xiushan said that it was true and that Wu Gensheng should know the reason for his detention. On September 2nd, Wu and a person named Mao came to the Yangzi Hotel to find Zhu, saying that he owed Xiushan old debts and entrusted Zhu to pass them on, but Zhu did not agree and asked Shao Liang to pass them on.

Arrested While Refusing

On September 4th, Wu called Zhu to meet at the Da Sanyuan Restaurant at 6:00 PM. At that time, Wu said that he owed Xiushan too much old debt, that the previous payment was insufficient, and still asked Zhu to pass on the remainder. Zhu was unwilling and was refusing when he was arrested by plainclothes police. At that time, Wu said to Zhu: "I invited you out to testify, it's not your business, you should tell the truth." The court asked: "Is it true that 500 gold yuan were found on your person when you were arrested?" Zhu replied: "No, the gold yuan were on the table, and I was refusing." At this point, because the plaintiff, Wu Gensheng, manager of the St. George's Garden Hotel, had not appeared in court, and the case was complicated, the court ordered an adjournment. The defendants' request for bail was denied, and they were returned to custody. The court adjourned at around 1:00 PM.

### Conspiracy to Sabotage Power Plant Case Re-Tried; Wang Xiaohe Still Sentenced to Death; Wu Guozhen Sentenced to Life Imprisonment; Remaining Sentences Upheld

[Our Report from Nanjing, 24th] The Shanghai Special Criminal Tribunal sentenced Wang Xiaohe, Standing Director of the Industry Labor Union of the Shanghai Power Company, and Wu Guozhen, a worker at the Yangshupu Power Plant of the Power Company, after they were found guilty of conspiracy to sabotage the power plant on July 19th. The case was submitted to the Central Special Criminal Tribunal, which on the 24th upheld the original death sentence and permanent deprivation of civil rights for Wang Xiaohe. Wu Guozhen's original death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and permanent deprivation of civil rights. The other defendants: Zhang Shibin, life imprisonment; Wu Shishen, two years' imprisonment; Tan Asi, one year and six months' imprisonment; Chen Longgen and Shi Zhonggen, one year's imprisonment; Huang Hongxun, exemption from punishment. All original sentences are upheld.

### Scarcity of Food Supplies; Urging Appreciation of Broken Rice

[Our Report] The People's Food Distribution Committee stated that there were many misunderstandings from the outside regarding the delayed distribution of rice this month. The person in charge of the Distribution Office stated yesterday that the source of the current distribution is controlled by the Ministry of Food, and the People's Food Distribution Committee is only responsible for distribution. To expedite the delivery of rice to the hands of the citizens, the rice ships now go directly to the rice shops upon arrival at the port, without first going to the warehouse. The People's Food Distribution Committee has done its utmost. In addition, the outside world generally does not welcome broken rice. This is not due to poor selection, but because the import of rice from foreign countries requires that whole rice be paired with broken rice, and the price is the same. At a time when food supplies are difficult after the war, and comprehensive distribution in the Shanghai area has lasted for more than half a year, the Ministry of Food has also done its utmost. The *Wen* and the *Hai Huang*, *Chenggong* vessels arriving yesterday and today, respectively, also had a large proportion of broken rice. It is hoped that citizens, amid the current call for diligence and frugality, will remember that although rice grains may be whole or broken, they are hard-earned and should be cherished.

### First Step in Rationing Daily Necessities: Coal Briquettes First

### Evidence of Criminal Behavior Conclusive; Extreme Punishment Imposed to Avert Others: Central Special Tribunal Judgment in Wang Chunzhe Case

[Our Report] Wang Chunzhe's death sentence upheld and executed by firing squad. The original judgment of the Central Special Criminal Tribunal is extracted below: "The appellant Wang Chunzhe, in the 36th year of the Republic, partnered with Lin Mingjian to establish the Lin Wang Company. After the victory, it was renamed Lin Wang Trading Company at 131 Beijing Road, Shanghai. Wang Chunzhe, as the sole proprietor, served as manager and hired Zheng Jiayu as deputy manager. Wang Chunzhe also partnered with Wang Shenghe and Wang Shunan to open Liansheng Trading Company, located at the same address, also managed by Wang Chunzhe. These two businesses were affiliated with the Shantou Lin Wang Company (Wang Chunzhe as shareholder and deputy manager, Lin Mingjian as shareholder and manager). In Hong Kong, they entrusted Tai Kun Company, managed by Zheng Tingjiao, to handle business. They used the import and export of yarn, lace, and rubber as cover to engage in large-scale black market trading of gold, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars, and used telegraphic transfers to conduct foreign exchange transactions. They kept separate accounts, using code names such as 'beans,' 'sugar,' 'rice,' 'noodles,' 'powder,' and 'you' to represent 'gold,' 'US dollars,' and 'Hong Kong dollars,' and using 'dan' to represent 'liang' for transactions.

Sufficient to Impact the Entire Country

The accounts show that from January 23rd to March 10th of the 37th year, the income from the purchase and sale of Hong Kong dollars and private Hong Kong exchange totaled HK$1,532,882.07, while the payments totaled HK$1,984,612.06. From January to April of the 37th year, a total of HK$350,303 was privately exchanged. From March 9th to 15th of the 37th year, the income from the purchase and sale of US dollars and foreign exchange totaled US$147,666.26. From March 9th to May 6th of the 37th year, the payments totaled US$150,295.26. From March 18th to April 26th of the 37th year, 196.895 taels of gold were bought and 196.544 taels were sold. 1,754 US dollars were exchanged for 30 taels of gold, and 10.325 taels of gold were exchanged for 557 US dollars. There were financial transactions with Shanghai's Ruikangcheng Exchange House, Datong Bank, and Datong Bank. The transaction area reached New York, San Francisco, London, Hong Kong, Shantou, which was a large-scale disruption of Shanghai's financial organization, sufficient to impact the national economy and lead to social unrest.

Original Judgment Not Unfounded

The original trial adopted the appellant's confession, and the Lin Wang Trading Company's accounts were found in the appellant's residence at the Huamao Hotel. After verification by the Financial Administration Bureau, it was confirmed that there were large-scale gold and dollar exchange activities under the names of Xiongji, Zheji, Yuji, Tai Kun, and Tongrong Lianfa, etc. Zheng Jiayu's letter to Wang Chunbo included the words: 'The Financial Administration Bureau is very strict with various investigations, and the communications between Hong Kong and Shanghai have all been changed to code words. The following is a record of the previous copy... Hong Kong exchange (You)... American (Sugar)...' Based on these facts, and considering the seriousness of the crime, the sentence of extreme punishment was imposed in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 1, Item 10 of the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the State during the Period of Suppression of Rebellion, which is not unfounded.

Grounds for Appeal

The grounds for appeal and defense include the following: (1) The Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the State during the Period of Suppression of Rebellion is political in nature, aimed at undermining the government. The defendant's responsibility for the black market trading of gold, foreign currency, and foreign exchange is merely a simple disruption of financial behavior, without the intention to undermine the work of suppressing rebellion. (2) The gold and foreign exchange trading was Zheng Jiayu's personal illegal act, and the appellant cannot be held responsible. (3) The appellant left the country on September 19th of the 36th year and returned to Shanghai on April 26th of the 37th year, so he could not have been involved in Zheng Jiayu's malfeasance.

Emergency Criminal Law Not Limited to Insurgents

This court holds that the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the State during the Period of Suppression of Rebellion is aimed at crimes that endanger the State's work of suppressing rebellion, but is not limited to punishing insurgents with political motives. Any behavior that meets the requirements of this law should be punished. Large-scale black market trading of gold, foreign currency, and foreign exchange is sufficient to disrupt the financial order, make the black market rampant, and greatly hinder the work of suppressing rebellion. Anyone with basic economic knowledge knows this. The appellant received higher education and engaged in import and export business, so he should have been more aware of this. Knowing that it was hindering the work of suppressing rebellion and still allowing it to happen means that he foresaw the occurrence, and its occurrence did not violate his original intention. Therefore, it is difficult to say that he had no intention of hindering the suppression of rebellion. Also, the appellant was the manager of Lin Wang Trading Company, and Zheng Jiayu was the deputy manager, so the appellant should be fully responsible for all business activities of the company. Furthermore, the gold and foreign exchange trading accounts were found in the appellant's private residence. Therefore, he cannot blame Zheng Jiayu's individual actions.

Returned from Hong Kong Long Ago

Furthermore, the appellant traveled abroad from September to November of last year, which is evidenced by his passport. However, he returned to the country from Hong Kong in December of the same year, which is evidenced by Lin Mingjian's letter to the appellant and the company's daily records of Wang Jingli's and Wang Chunzhe's accounts. Moreover, the company's operation of gold, US dollars, and foreign exchange continued until May 6th of this year, so it cannot be attributed to Zheng Jiayu's malfeasance. The empty statements of defense are insufficient to adopt. However, the appellant engaged in the gold, foreign currency, and foreign exchange business with general intent, committing the same crime repeatedly. The original judgment did not apply Article 56 of the Criminal Law, which is a mistake. Also, the appellant committed several crimes due to complex laws, and one law should be selected from the multiple laws. The original judgment mistakenly stated that violating Article 1 of the Regulations on the Punishment of Gold and Foreign Currency Trading and the Central Bank's Regulations on Foreign Exchange Control was merely a method of disrupting the financial order, and imposed a heavier penalty in accordance with Article 55 of the Criminal Law. This is also an error and should be revoked and amended. Considering the circumstances, the extreme punishment should still be imposed to deter others. September 22nd of the 37th year of the Republic of China, the First Division of the Central Special Criminal Tribunal, Presiding Judge Lou Guang, Judges Ye You Tang, Zhang Wen, Gong Cheng, Yin Rubiong."

### Yong An Warehouse in Hong Kong Burns for 32 Hours; Fire Extinguished; 115 Bodies Unearthed

[Our Report from Guangzhou, 24th] The Hong Kong fire was extinguished at 4:00 PM on the 23rd. A total of 115 bodies have been unearthed. The Yong An Warehouse has not yet been excavated, and it is unknown how many bodies are inside.

[Our Report from Hong Kong via Airmail, 22nd] The Yong An Warehouse in Sai Wan, Hong Kong, caught fire at 8:00 AM on the 22nd. In the past month, there have been three warehouse fires in Hong Kong. In addition to the loss of 800,000 yuan worth of pharmaceuticals at the naval dockyard warehouse, the previous fire at the Kowloon Warehouse and this fire at the Yong An Warehouse have resulted in losses of over 10 million yuan, truly a "catastrophe" for Hong Kong merchants!

Spontaneous Explosion

The fire at the Yong An Warehouse was also caused by the spontaneous explosion of chemical substances due to the weather. The warehouse is located next to the tram line and is a four-story building converted from residential houses, four in a row. The upper floors are residential. Therefore, in addition to the loss of goods, there was also the tragedy of people being buried in the fire. The death toll was heavy, and the losses were huge, surpassing the fire at the Jiujiang Road warehouse in Shanghai this year.

According to survivors, before the fire, there was a sudden explosion from the warehouse. The ground around the warehouse cracked open, and five or six barrels were thrown out of the warehouse. One of the barrels contained a gelatinous substance, which scattered on the road and immediately ignited. At that time, a tram was passing by, and a ball of fire almost hit the carriage, which was very dangerous. Residents on the second, third, and fourth floors were blocked from escaping by smoke and flames. More than a dozen people jumped from the second floor and were injured, and dozens of people rushed out of the burning smoke, their heads and faces scorched. It is impossible to determine the number of people buried in the fire.

Goods Piled Up Like Mountains

The fact that Hong Kong has experienced three warehouse fires in just one month shows that the goods stored in Hong Kong, due to domestic restrictions, cannot be shipped out and have reached a "mountainous" level. Poor management has led to the tragedy. It is said that many of these goods were purchased and stored by large domestic merchants.

The goods are mainly chemical raw materials such as pigments and caustic soda, as well as oils. It is said that there are also some general merchandise from various countries.

### Another Fire

Carelessness in the Film Room of the Beihe Theater

[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 24th] On the evening of the 23rd, a fire broke out in the film storage room of the Beihe Theater in Hong Kong due to carelessness, affecting nearby houses. Two people were killed and nine were injured. This fire is the fourth major fire in the past week, and all occurred in warehouses storing flammable materials.

### Anti-Banditry Operations in Zhoushan Come to an End; Gui Yongqing Leaves Zhejiang for Beijing

### Execution of Three Fugitive Bandits in Zhenhai

[Report from Zhenhai, this newspaper, 22nd] Five bandits, Wang A-Long, Wang Zu-Ting, Zhang Xin-Di, Ye Wang-Lin, and Chen A-Ren, were apprehended by the county constabulary. However, before being escorted to Hangzhou, Zhang, Ye, and Wang A-Long suddenly confessed that they had remaining accomplices hiding nearby. To lead the police in their apprehension, the police bureau, based on this confession, dispatched Inspector Zhang with officers on the morning of the 21st to escort the bandits. When they reached the outskirts of Houshi, Zhang Xin-Di, Ye Yu-Long, and Wang A-Long each suddenly broke and ran. The officers fired their guns in pursuit, but they did not heed the warnings. They were all shot in vital areas and died instantly.

### Thunderstorm in Jiaxing at Night: A Bolt of Lightning—

The Yard Filled with Red Light—A Section of the Utility Pole is Sliced Off

[Report from Jiaxing, this newspaper, 23rd] The weather has been sultry for days, with occasional showers. On the night of the 22nd, there was another thunderstorm. At about 11 PM, a bolt of lightning struck, startling many from their sleep. At the Nan Yuan study yard in Chunshu Alley, in the city, the base of the western pillar, where multiple electrical switches were installed, was struck. Due to the electrical surge, the wooden pieces were peeled off. The fire meter wire at the entrance was burnt, and many of the electrical wires and switches exploded.

Many people went to observe it on the 23rd.

### Inquiry into the Case of Gang Rape of a Regiment Commander's Wife in Hankou—Victim Breaks Down in Tears During Confrontation—Four Military Officers to be Sentenced to Death

[Report from Hankou, this newspaper, 24th] The military court of the Supply Area Command continues its investigation into the case of six army hospital convalescing officers gang-raping the wife of a regiment commander. In addition to the prime suspects Cui Bowen, Shi Pan, Ling Zhi, Cha Dajun, Zeng Limin, and Yuan Shangzhi, the victim, Mrs. Lou Jiangting (i.e., Chen Tou), was also brought in for a confrontation. While recounting the ordeal, Chen's words were filled with sorrow, and she broke down in tears. After the interrogation, a responsible official of the military court told reporters that the facts of the rape had largely been established (details will be announced in the coming days). According to the Criminal Law of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Cui, Shi, Ling, and Zeng should be sentenced to the sole penalty of death. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate whether there were other circumstances between the prime suspects and the victim, to ensure that justice is served. Cha Dajun and Yuan Shangzhen, as they are not currently serving military personnel, will be transferred to the civilian court for trial immediately.

### The Dead End of "Gold Rushers" in the Borderlands: Corrupt Officials in Dihua Caught in the Net of Justice

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Changqing

[Airmail report from Dihua, 22nd] "Severely Punishing Corruption" is one of the main policies of Zhang Zhizhong's administration in Xinjiang. However, because many people from the interior who come to the borderlands have fantasies of striking it rich, this unhealthy mentality is deeply entrenched and cannot be eradicated in a short period. Therefore, ethnic minorities in the borderlands call all civil servants from the interior "headaches." These "headaches" have now reached a dead end. The prosecution of the former Deputy Director of the Department of Reconstruction, Gu Qianji, is a clear example of this. Other corruption cases, large and small, are also constantly emerging.

Deputy Director Profiting through Public Office

Qianji is currently 44 years old, a native of Wuyang, Jiangsu, and an animal husbandry expert. He originally served as the director of the Xinjiang Serum Factory. After the reorganization of the Xinjiang Provincial Government in the 35th year of the Republic, he was appointed as the Deputy Director of the Department of Reconstruction, one of the seven provincial government members representing the Central Government. In February of this year, the current Deputy Director of the Department of Reconstruction, Liu De'en, the Chief Accountant of the department, Gou Tingxiang, and the Inspection Director, Ni Zuxin, jointly reported Gu Qianji for corruption to the Northwest Headquarters, causing a sensation in the political circles of Dihua and attracting attention from people throughout Xinjiang. The authorities immediately escorted Gu Qianji to the Dihua District Court Procuratorate for investigation. After six months of investigation and evidence gathering by the prosecutor, an indictment was filed last month. The main points of the indictment are three:

(1) On October 21 of the 36th year of the Republic, the defendant, in the name of the Serum Factory, borrowed 80 million provincial dollars from the Department of Reconstruction's Coal Mine Factory as a winter coal relief fund for the poor (in the past, one Xinjiang provincial dollar was equivalent to five legal tender dollars; all figures below are in provincial dollars). On November 25, he borrowed another 20 million provincial dollars, clearly indicating private misappropriation of public funds.

(2) The Department of Reconstruction had many machines in Chongqing. The defendant proposed and passed a provincial government meeting to transport them to Dihua, with approved transportation costs of 600 million dollars. The actual receipt was 400 million dollars. After the defendant received the funds in late December of the 36th year of the Republic, he privately remitted 250 million dollars to Li Jiaode of the Jiading Bank in Shanghai. Of the remaining 150 million dollars, 15 million dollars were used to purchase cloth for the consultant of the Department of Reconstruction, Zi Daxin, 50 million dollars were used to subsidize the November salaries of staff, 10 million dollars were lent to the Southern Xinjiang Epidemic Prevention Team, 5 million dollars were used by the Serum Factory to manufacture vaccines, and 7 million dollars were lent to staff as year-end bonuses. The remainder was misappropriated by the defendant for personal use.

(3) The Department of Reconstruction received 70 million dollars for translating scientific books in late December of the 36th year of the Republic. After deducting legitimate expenses of 4 million dollars, the remaining amount was used by the defendant to purchase cloth, cigarettes, and other items. The above-mentioned acts of the defendant misappropriating public funds for personal gain constitute a crime in law.

After the District Court Criminal Division accepted the case, it held three investigative hearings and one open collegiate trial. Gu Qianji responded to the three points raised:

(1) The two loans from the Coal Mine Factory totaled only 100 million dollars. He did not specifically request them under the heading of the poor people's winter coal relief fund. The loans were taken out due to his wife's illness and a lack of savings. The loans, taken out in his private name, have all been repaid.

(2) The distribution of the special funds for transporting machinery, in addition to the items listed in the indictment, was used for travel expenses and resettlement allowances for staff. It cannot be said that he misappropriated them. The purchase of goods is also untrue.

(3) Of the 70 million dollars for translating books, over 10 million dollars were spent with receipts. As for the 66 million dollars spent on purchasing cloth and cigarettes, it is indeed a fact. This was because prices had risen when the funds were allocated, and the amount differed greatly from the original budget. It was also difficult to add additional funds, so the purchases were made to make up for the shortfall. The purchases were made for the sake of the public good, not for personal gain. In short, he acted too hastily and did not follow procedures, but he only wanted to do his best to complete the tasks he was responsible for. He never intended to profit personally.

The debate on this case has now concluded, and a verdict will be announced at a scheduled date after deliberation by the judges.

Shortage of Horses at the Livestock Farm

Two other corruption cases also occurred under the Department of Reconstruction. One involves Sha Wuke, the director of the Ceramics Factory, who owed wages from January to July of this year, totaling over 287.1 million provincial dollars (equivalent to over 1.435 billion legal tender dollars). Sha Wuke's younger brother, Se Ahong, withdrew 100 million provincial dollars and gave it to technician Se Dula to purchase raw materials in Shanshan. Only 4,000 catties were transported to Baishi, and there were no receipts. He also privately set up a glass factory on South Pole Rear Street. Many of the raw materials and items in the factory were public property. Sha Wuke also purchased 19 taels of gold. After the Department of Reconstruction discovered this a few days ago, Sha Wuke fled in fear of punishment.

The Department of Reconstruction investigated the facts of corruption and fraud by Patula, the director of the Yanqi Pasture under the Department of Reconstruction, and found that 33 horses and 100 sheep were missing. Public funds totaling 12,621,700 provincial dollars were also used. Patula has now been escorted to Dihua and transferred to the District Court for trial and punishment.

Cashier Lavishly Spends Money

Cases of automatic reporting by the District Procuratorate were rare in Dihua in the past. Recently, Ma Shouxiang, the chief cashier of the Department of Education, aroused the attention of the District Procuratorate because he spent money lavishly every day as an ordinary civil servant. After a preliminary investigation, it was confirmed that he was engaged in corruption and embezzlement. The amount of public funds embezzled, for which full evidence has been found, reached as much as 2 billion provincial dollars (10 billion legal tender dollars). An indictment was immediately filed. In addition to detaining Ma a few days ago, the investigation is continuing in preparation for filing a public prosecution.

### Importers and Exporters Association Recommends the Improvement of Multiple Restrictions and Facilitating Exports to the Export Management Committee

[This newspaper dispatch] This city's Importers and Exporters Association has recently recommended four improvements to the Export Management Committee regarding the promotion of exports and the issue of export commodity price limits. The main points are recorded as follows: (1) The price limits for domestic export commodities should be made more practical. (2) Strict prohibition should be imposed on non-industry individuals purchasing export commodities. (3) Relevant authorities should uniformly facilitate the transportation of export goods throughout the country. (4) Relevant authorities should stipulate that export goods, if there is proof of sale abroad, should not be subject to the three-month restriction period.

[Another dispatch] The issuance of import permits for import goods has been temporarily suspended since August 19, so the import of goods has not yet returned to normal.

The monthly approved imports of items listed in Appendix Table (3) A are only around several hundred thousand US dollars.

### The Authorities Order the Registration of Inventory; Rice Prices Fall; Flour is Available but Unmarketable, Leading to Stagnation

The rice market has seen a slight decline. The prices of various grades of Japonica and Indica rice in the northern rice market have generally fallen by 10 cents. This is because the market management authorities have persuaded the industry to voluntarily form a pact and suppress prices on their own, so businesses have slightly reduced prices for sales. In the southern market, the prices of high-quality rice have fallen by 5 to 10 cents. Also, because the authorities have ordered the registration of inventory, morale has weakened, and supply is abundant. The number of registered arrivals has also increased. Yesterday, the total arrivals in the northern and southern markets totaled 5,036 piculs.

Flour

There have been no transactions, leading to stagnation. Because flour mills directly distribute to retailers, wholesalers have no supply, resulting in a lack of trading in the market. Even the low-quality Nan brand flour has seen no trading. Iron skin flour was offered at the limit price, 1,300 packages.

Grains

Continue to be firm. The supply of soybeans is scarce, and bean curd factories are absorbing them, with some transactions. New soybeans from Xuzhou were offered at 13.5 yuan. Maize from the northern region is being purchased very heavily, and prices have risen to the limit. Red sorghum supply is scarce and also rose by 20 cents. Broad beans are stable. The export of naked barley has revived, sales are brisk, and prices have risen by 20 to 30 cents. There have been no transactions in tea beans. Sesame remains at the original price, and raw peanuts from the plantations are still being traded at the limit price.

Cooking Oil

Market sentiment has fallen. Soybean oil and vegetable oil have each fallen by one yuan because the authorities have ordered the registration of inventory, and many people are selling their existing stocks. The closing price was 49.5 yuan. The factories did not open, and vegetable oil was 46 yuan, also down one yuan. Raw oil and small sesame oil are still stable due to scarcity. Datong brand soybean cakes were offered at 600 pieces, priced at 4.6 yuan.

### The Sugar Market Turns Weak

Yesterday, the sugar market became weak because the rumors of allowing exports proved false. The appetite in this street turned weak, and customers stopped buying due to transportation difficulties, and the inventory in the market was instantly abundant. The prices of sugar in the 20th period from Taiwan were small after the tickets opened, and closing was increasingly weak. Coarse sugar and granulated sugar were sold off more, and the trend was even weaker. The others, such as refined white and red, were all brought down and smaller. The prices of each grade fell by an average of 5 to 8 or 9 cents compared to the previous day.

### Few Transactions in the Tea Market

Yesterday's tea market continued to show a situation of scarce transactions and firm prices. Although buyers continue to come one after another, the owners ultimately defended their prices due to the high production costs, unwilling to let go lightly. Therefore, the result of negotiations between the two sides mostly fell into deadlock, and trading ultimately weakened. As for the trend, in this situation, it again meandered and showed signs of strength, and there was no precarious situation in the market.

It is reported that overseas attention to Chinese tea remains strong, but the high domestic production costs make it difficult to smoothly coordinate exports, resulting in a sharp decrease in recent export volumes. However, it is heard that some Chinese merchants and exporters are actively expanding foreign sales and establishing international markets. Although there is no profit to be made, they still plan to continue sales one after another. In this situation, the foreign tea market has no sign of weakness.

### The Deadline for Exchange is Approaching Rapidly; Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Exchange is Spiking Again

Recently, due to the rapidly approaching deadline for the exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency, citizens are rushing to exchange again. According to the Business Bureau of the National Bank, the total amount exchanged in this city on the 23rd was 35,670.608 taels of gold, 19,201.89 taels of silver, 94,099 yuan in silver dollars, 110,649 jiao in silver coins, 783,669 US dollars, and 147,190.76 Hong Kong dollars. The total value of the above five items was 10,643,435.84 gold yuan.

### Copper and Nickel Coins Returned by Japan Have Arrived in Shanghai

Received by the National Bank and the China Trust Bureau

The Hai Liao ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 21st of this month from Sasebo, carrying the first batch of over 1,800 tons of copper and nickel coins that were looted by the Japanese army during the war, and berthed at the Zhanghuabang Wharf. On the evening of the 23rd, it was moved from Zhanghuabang to the Huangpu Wharf, and unloading began at 8:00 AM on the 24th. The Shanghai representative office of the Executive Yuan's Supervisory Committee for Japanese Reparations and Returned Materials specially dispatched a person in charge to preside over the event and handed over the copper and nickel coins to the Central Bank and the China Trust Bureau for joint receipt.

### Banks and Companies Reporting Foreign Exchange Should be Responsible by the Chairman and Others

[This newspaper dispatch] It was recently learned from the Central Bank that the bank has received instructions from the Executive Yuan stating that when banks, companies, and firms report gold, cash, and foreign exchange, it should be stipulated that the chairman, managing director of each bank, company, and firm, with at least two people, and the general manager must jointly sign and affix their seals and be jointly responsible.

Another dispatch: The reporting of foreign exchange by foreign banks is being expedited. Only a few have not yet reported, and the foreign banks and firms that have reported have been gradually transferring their assets. Gold and foreign currency have been deposited into the Central Bank. Rumors of difficulties are definitely not true.

### Chinese Automobile Dealers Demand Equal Treatment with Foreign Dealers

The Executive Yuan's Economic Management Committee, in accordance with the measures to strengthen economic controls, has set import quotas for the seventh and eighth quarters. The automobile cardong item, which was originally available in the fifth and sixth quarters, has been deleted. However, foreign companies can apply separately for the import of the above-mentioned vehicles, which has caused dissatisfaction among Chinese automobile dealers. They believe that the government is condoning foreign companies to import and prohibiting Chinese companies from importing automobiles, which not only consumes foreign exchange but also violates the principle of economy. The Automobile Business Association of this city has recently represented the Chinese automobile business houses with automobile import qualifications, submitting a report to the Economic Control Committee and the Thrift Guidance Committee of the Executive Yuan, requesting that they receive the same treatment as foreign companies.

### The Silk Reeling Association Resolves to Maintain the Limit Price for Autumn Cocoons

And Supply Raw Silk to the Silk Weaving Industry

The Silk Reeling Industry Association of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai regions convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors a few days ago at the Bankers' Association Clubhouse on Hong Kong Road, chaired by Chairman Chen Aishi, to discuss the procurement of autumn cocoons for this season. It was noted that autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have already entered the market. On the 20th of this month, the association received a telegram from the Four Banks Joint Office suspending loans for autumn cocoons. Silk manufacturers are now negotiating loans with commercial banks and renting lines to purchase cocoons. The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, in accordance with the Outline of the Sericulture Production and Sales Plan, have stipulated a standard fresh cocoon price of 80 yuan per city dan. However, according to reports from cocoon-producing areas, speculators are competing to purchase cocoons, causing the price to soar, exceeding the government regulations, especially in Wuxi. In order to comply with government laws and regulations, the association has resolved:

(1) The association will notify all member factories to strictly adhere to the government's stipulated price for purchasing cocoons. (2) The association will send letters to relevant authorities requesting that they effectively crack down on non-industry personnel (i.e., [unclear characters] merchants) from purchasing cocoons to prevent dried cocoons from becoming hoarding targets. (3) The association will submit reports to relevant ministries and the Four Banks Joint Office requesting that manufacturers who have purchased dry cocoons be provided with pawn loans to facilitate capital flow and that the autumn silk reeled be purchased continuously in accordance with the original method, with unified export sales, so that the government can control export goods and earn foreign exchange.

Furthermore, in order to comply with the government's new economic measures and to consider the raw material needs of the silk weaving industry, the association unanimously resolved that it would notify all member factories that, in addition to the raw silk that should be handed over to the government for purchase and that which is suitable for export, they should allocate and sell their remaining raw silk to the silk weaving industry at the market price on August 19 to show mutual assistance. The Standing Committee has been authorized to coordinate the allocation to various factories based on the number of machines and production volume of each member factory.

### Woolen Fabrics Are Actually Selling Well

Recently, as the weather has turned cooler, more people are making winter clothes, and woolen fabrics are selling well. The business of men's and women's clothing, both Western and Chinese styles, is booming. Customers from Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places are also coming to Shanghai to place orders in an endless stream. The most popular items are medium-thick serge and navy blue wool gabardine, as well as overcoat woolens ranging from over 20 yuan to 40 yuan.

### The Rayon Market is Calm

The rayon market is quiet. Silk weaving mills have an appetite for rayon and are turning to supply it through rationing, sales are still smooth, and the market is moderately firm. Owners are very unwilling to sell, buyers' willingness to purchase is also weak, and morale seems to be very calm. No. 120 Tianqiao has some transactions at the limit price.

### Transactions of Spot Cotton are Thin

Yesterday, spot cotton transactions were still thin. Due to the weak supply from various places, arrivals are few and stocks are scarce. Owners are unwilling to let go lightly, and yarn factories have a relaxed appetite, resulting in few transactions. 37 bales of Zhengzhou cotton were traded, and 136 bales of Shashi cotton were traded at prices of 141 yuan and 140 yuan. Zhoupu seed cotton was 30 yuan and 8 cents, with the good rising by 6 cents.

### Promoting the Shares of State-Owned Enterprises; The National Bank Plans Three Measures

The Central Bank is actively seeking ways to remedy the shares of state-owned enterprises. According to the head of the bank, they are planning to open up sales channels for the shares of state-owned enterprises. Three measures have been decided: (1) The assets and liabilities of each unit of state-owned enterprises should be quickly reported, printed separately, and distributed for investors to choose from. (2) Guarantee the interests of investors and increase dividends. (3) Revise the dividend payment method to increase investors' interest. In the past, interest was paid once a year, but now it is planned to pay interest every three months. (4) Increase the sales area and gradually spread it to major cities.

### The Yarn Market is Apparently Flat But Actually Firm; Cloth Hoarders Release Their Stocks and Prices Fall Sharply

Yesterday's yarn market remained strong, with both coarse and fine yarns reaching the limit price. The appetite in this street remained strong, and the market was apparently flat but actually firm. The supply of 42-count fine yarn was not abundant, and few transactions were made, but prices reached the limit. 40-count and 32-count yarns were traded at the limit price, and the market showed no signs of weakness. 21-count Double Horse Shenxin was offered at 770 yuan and traded at 780 yuan in the market, the price was the same as the previous day. The prices of 20-count yarns, except for Hong Kuixing, Double Carp, and Jiuhua, which were slightly off the limit, were all at the limit price. 16-count and 10-count yarns rose by 3.5 yuan each.

The cloth market was deeply affected by the commodity registration and saw a sharp decline yesterday. Because the registered warehouse inventory will be subject to stricter controls, hoarders were nervous and rushed to sell their stocks first. Empty orders returned to wreak havoc, causing a widespread decline.

Dragon Head fine cloth retreated from 27.4 yuan, and at 11:15 AM, it was traded at a low of 25.6 yuan. Sijunzi Yuan twill retreated from 27.3 yuan to 26.9 yuan. Wufu and Laba Tong fine cloths were all offered for sale at 24 yuan. With more supply than demand, prices were like fallen leaves in the autumn wind, declining continuously.

Because the speculators had profits to compensate for the losses, the selling pressure eased slightly. Also, the prices of goods in other cities were brisk. If the commodity registration was only aimed at investigating the amount of inventory, and if the issuance of export certificates was likely to be implemented soon, morale stabilized slightly. Dragon Head fine cloth rebounded to close at 26.6 yuan, down 1.4 yuan from the previous day. Wufu fine cloth later rebounded to 24.6 yuan, ultimately down 1 yuan. Laba Tong fell by 1.2 yuan, Sijunzi Yuan twill traded at a low of 26.9 yuan and finally closed at 27.5 yuan. Most of the remaining fabrics declined, and trading increased sharply. The total transaction volume in the city was 2,160 pieces.

### Hao Gengsheng Discusses Impressions of British and American Sports, Trends in World Sports, Promoting Recreational Sports

[This newspaper's dispatch] Hao Gengsheng, the general secretary of the Chinese National Sports Association, returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday after attending the World Games and inspecting British and American sports. Hao specially hosted reporters from various newspapers in the city at the Municipal Gymnasium at 4 PM yesterday to share his observations and impressions gained in the UK and US in great detail. A summary is as follows:

British Calm and Serious

During this two-month trip abroad, I stayed in the UK and the US for about a month each. I deeply realized that sports are an important part of education and are related to the entire national political, social, and economic structure. British sports fully demonstrate their calm, serious, and unexaggerated national character and style. The World Games were also like this. Although its organization and propaganda arrangements were not as grand as the previous Berlin World Games, its success cannot be denied. Due to the UK's national economic difficulties, the sports community is also working together to overcome the difficulties, making full use of school equipment and simple sports equipment to provide children with sports and recreational activities. School sports facilities are relatively complete, and special attention is paid to children's sports activities. At this time of considerable food scarcity, children's nutrition is still fully supplied. During the World Games, other sports activities in various places did not stop slightly. On a Saturday holiday, as many as 400,000 people went on hikes, demonstrating their emphasis on sports and recreation. They pay special attention to sports teachers, and their slogan is: "A good sports system is important, but good teachers are even more important." The distinction between amateur and professional sports is very clear. The sports community does not approve of professional sports, but it also recognizes its value.

American Luxurious and Magnificent

In the United States, I visited sports facilities in New York, Boston, Washington, Chicago, and various parts of Jinshan. What the United States shows is very different from the UK, it is luxurious and magnificent sports. The abundance of sports funding, the completeness of sports equipment in various schools, the universality of social sports activities, and the large number of talents are far beyond our dreams. The Chicago municipal government even has a recreation bureau, which specializes in managing and promoting citizens' recreation and sports. Its scale is so great that it can set up its own factory to manufacture sports equipment. I visited a golf club factory with as many as 600 workers, and its branches numbered eight throughout the country, specializing in the manufacture of clubs alone. The establishment of temporary swimming pools in various places, built with wooden boards, oilcloth, and paper paste, which can be filled with water to form a pool and are extremely convenient to disassemble and assemble, can be called a new structure in sports. Professional sports are particularly developed in the United States, but restrictions on amateur sports are still very strict. Today, the new trend in world sports after the war is to make sports activities into sports entertainment. Today, American university sports departments also have entertainment departments to train talents for entertainment sports work. The result of this kind of effort in the United States is (1) to improve physical and mental health, (2) to enrich life interest, (3) to increase work efficiency, (4) to improve people's morals, and (5) to reduce urban crime. And their research progress in sports academic theory is also beyond the reach of others, and their contribution to world sports is profound and huge.

Our Country's Sports

Based on what I have gained from this inspection, I deeply feel that our country's sports should adopt strengths, compensate for weaknesses, and choose the good and follow it. The following four points are particularly urgent: (1) Establish national sports funding, (2) Actively cultivate sports talents, (3) Lay the foundation for school sports, (4) Establish sports academic research institutions. Chinese sports have some hope.

### Small Football League Today Three Matches in Group A

There are three matches in Group A of the small football league today, starting at 3 PM at Jinyuan Park on Changping Road. Tickets are sold at a general price of $0.50 in gold yuan.

The Railway team is known for its precision and ferocity. When they meet, a fierce battle is inevitable. In the second and third matches, the Qingbai brothers will separately face the Kang team and the Yiguang team. The Qingbaiqing team has gathered famous players. The Kang team was the runner-up in the previous Mayor's Cup. Today, when the two heroes meet for the first time, they will definitely fight with all their strength.

### Public Tennis Doubles Championship Today Rematch, Tao Wang vs. Ye Cai at 3:30 PM

The last act of public tennis, the men's doubles match between Tao Guanqiu and Wang Wenzheng against Ye Guanxiong and Cai Guoji, was not completed due to rain this Wednesday. The Tao Wang team was leading 7-5, 4-2. With the consent of both parties, the referee Lin Shihua canceled the results of the previous match and rescheduled it for 3:30 PM this afternoon at the Youth Tennis Club to determine the final championship of the open. These two doubles pairs are undoubtedly the strongest combination of the season. Although Tao Wang has been dominating undefeated for many years, it seems difficult to be sure of winning this time. Tickets today are sold at a uniform price of one yuan. Previous spectators can enter with their ticket stubs. Those who hold complimentary tickets that have been collected and canceled can sign their names at the entrance to attend.

### US Basketball Team Embarks for the Far East

Shanghai Not on the Itinerary

[United Press Oakland, California 23rd dispatch] A basketball team here plans to embark on a long journey to the Far East on October 2nd to learn from various countries in the East. Team leader Bidner recently announced that the average height of the entire team is six feet four and a half inches, including World Games athlete Los Angeles California University He Zhubashi, high school star Xia Lou, and Stanford University star Fu Shu, totaling eleven people. California international athlete Arron Meda will serve as the field coach. The itinerary is as follows: First, go to Manila for three matches, then to Tokyo, and after returning to Manila, return to the United States via Honolulu.

### Donations from Overseas for Our World Games Delegation

[This newspaper's dispatch] Regarding donations for the Chinese World Games delegation, Hao Gengsheng told reporters yesterday that a total of US$8,000 was received from the Philippines, US$8,000 was also received from Singapore, and Indonesia was unable to obtain the funds because the Dutch government prohibited large sums from being remitted to London. Only 200 yuan was spent when contacting the South Seas, and the airfare was more than 700 yuan. His wife, Ms. Gao Zi, went to the UK to attend the World Sports and Recreation Conference by order of the Executive Yuan, and the stipulated expenses were paid from the 25,000 US dollars given by the government. The hotel in London only cost more than two pounds a day for one person, which is not considered expensive, and the World Games athletes lived in dormitories, which also cost twenty shillings a day, etc.

### Insurance Cup Ping Pong Tournament Scheduled for Next Monday

The Insurance Cup Team Ping Pong Championship, organized by the Insurance Industry Colleagues Advancement Association of this city, has 15 participating teams. After more than two months of competition, the Dai Ren, United, and Tai An Salt teams have the best results, each with twelve wins. The Dai Ren team has the strongest strength and the highest voice for the championship, but the team aims to perform and is unwilling to calculate points, and automatically gives up the right to win the championship. In order to conclude the final battle, the organizing authorities convened a competition affairs meeting last night and resolved: (1) The final will be held at 7 PM on September 27th at the auditorium on the fourth floor of the Bank of China on Renji Road Bund. (2) Send a letter to Luo Beichen to award the prizes. (3) Send a letter to Chen Linsheng, Li Longbiao, and Shen Bohong to serve as referees.

### Yu Dafu's Will

— Lao Dan

Third Anniversary of Disaster

Yu Dafu's misfortune in Nanyang has been exactly three years to this day. Although there is no way to find out the exact date of his misfortune, some say it was September 25th, others say it was August 28th, and still others say it was September 18th. In short, it was not long after Japan surrendered to the United Nations. Calculated by time, it has been three years.

During the past three years, no one has yet organized and published Dafu's complete works. Only Zheng Ziyu's "Collection of Dafu's Poems and Lyrics" has been published. This small collection of poems and lyrics not only contains few poems and lyrics, but also does not include Dafu's nineteen poems on destroying his family. In addition, there are many errors in the words, and the editor also attached his own works as a tail, making it neither fish nor fowl. Even so, only this small booklet of poems and lyrics has been circulated as Dafu's posthumous works. The desolate situation of a literati after his death can be seen in general.

What kind of legacy did Dafu leave behind? This is what many people who care about Dafu want to know. He suffered misfortune in the autumn of the 34th year of the Republic of China. Strangely, he wrote a will in the first month of the lunar calendar that year. It is not known whether he was really writing a "will as an example at the beginning of each year" or whether he was temporarily moved and knew that life was fleeting, so he wrote a will in advance. If those superstitious people were to say that this will of his was a prophecy, written at the beginning of spring and passed away in the autumn. We don't need to study these things. Now, I will record the full text of his will:

"I am already fifty-four years old. Even if I die now, I will enjoy a middle-aged life. Heaven has unpredictable winds and clouds. Every year at the beginning of the year, I write a will as an example to prevent accidents.

Since changing my career to business, it has been almost eight years. All the profits I have made have been given to my friends, relatives, and poor people, so there are not many savings. According to statistics, the current cash is about two ten thousand shields. The property in the family is worth about three ten thousand shields. "Dan Jiebin" has a residential cottage and a piece of land, 125 meters long and 25 meters wide, totaling more than 14,000 shields. All these properties, vegetables, cash, gold, silver, utensils, etc., should be jointly managed by my wife, He Liyou, and my son, Daya, and his brother or sister (not yet born). The paper mill and "Qijiapo" shares, etc., are not included because they have not been determined.

In the country, there is a residence in Guanchang Alley in Hangzhou and a collection of five million volumes of books. After this great chaos, I don't know if they still exist. There are also three sons in the country, Fei, Yun, and Jun. Although there is no inheritance, it is expected that they have grown up. Separated by thousands of miles, there is no way to ask about them. My writings under my pen name include more than ten kinds. For more than ten years, I have not received a penny in royalties. If someone can negotiate with the Shanghai Beixin Bookstore, which publishes these books, the three sons in the country may be able to obtain tens of thousands of yuan, but this is an unknown number and is not a confirmed property, so there is no need to write it down. New Year's Day in the year of Yiyou."

New Year's Day in the year of Yiyou is February of the 34th year. The will says that he has been in business for eight years, which does not seem to be true, because he left Singapore in February of the second year after the outbreak of the Pacific War, and he only started the Zhaoyu Distillery in the autumn of that year. By February of the 34th year, he had only been in business for more than two years. The eight years mentioned seem to be embellishments. If calculated from the time he went to Nanyang from the country, it would be more than six years. The residence in Guanchang Alley in Hangzhou refers to the thatched cottage in the wind and rain. However, the number of five million volumes of books he said may be a mistake, because five million volumes of books occupy a lot of space. But from another perspective, the legacy of a generation of literati is only this trivial amount, which is also very regrettable.

### Also Discussing Brush Fees

— You Mo Jun

Some time ago, this publication carried an article by Mr. Xiao Tui entitled "Serious Words on Brush Fees." It provided comprehensive examples of the origins of brush fees and various titles for self-determined rates, making it quite interesting to read. It is said that the term "brush fee" appears in official history in the Biography of Zheng Yi in the Book of Sui. The biography states: "Yi was restored to the title of Duke of Pei, appointed Pillar of the State, and the emperor ordered Li Delin to draft an imperial edict. Gao Jiong jokingly said to Yi, 'Your brush is dry!' Yi replied, 'Having served as a regional shepherd, I returned home with only my walking stick, without a single coin. How can I afford to wet my brush?' The emperor laughed heartily." If the brush is dry, it needs to be wetted; this humorous exchange is considered the origin of the term "brush fee" by later generations.

When people pay to request calligraphy or paintings, they often ask for an inscription to be added as a sign of respect. There are two main reasons for this: first, the requester admires the great name of the artist and wishes to establish a spiritual connection; second, with the inscription, the work cannot be taken or stolen by others and can be permanently treasured. However, in the past, some calligraphers and painters refused to add inscriptions, or if they did, they would charge double the brush fee. Zhang Yu was an example of the former, and Kang Youwei was an example of the latter. The reason they refused to add inscriptions was that they had a very high opinion of themselves. They thought, "I do not know you personally, so how can I address just anyone as 'Benevolent Brother,' 'Sir,' or 'Master'!" It's hard to understand that if you are already selling your calligraphy, how could you be so concerned? Kang Youwei came up with the harsh rule of charging double for inscriptions to limit requests, but he shot himself in the foot and became a laughingstock.

There was a certain Mr. A whose background was unknown, but he had a lot of money. He specially asked Kang Youwei to write calligraphy and requested an inscription. After paying the double fee, he went to collect his piece one day, only to find that the inscription only had the two characters of Mr. A's given name, with the character below it missing. He was furious and questioned Kang, saying, "How dare you address me by my given name without respect!" After speaking, he angrily tore Kang's calligraphy into pieces and threw them on the ground. Kang had never experienced such an insult, and his beard bristled with anger. He scooped up the money that Mr. A. had paid and threw it at his head. For a moment, the coins fell to the ground, dancing and spinning. Mr. A left without a word.

Some calligraphers and painters also charged double if no inscription was added. Xiao Tuitang of Yushan was skilled in seal script, which had a particularly charming ancient flavor. Therefore, some art dealers specifically asked him to write single pieces to make them easier to sell, because with an inscription, people would either "not want" it or "ask for a lower price." Mr. Xiao was aware of this, and because he saw them as stockpiling goods, he came up with a method of charging double the fee if no inscription was added. This was told to me by a friend; I don't know if it's true.

Tang Tuo, who specialized in writing shop signs, was one who included a standard scale of measurements with his fee schedule. There was a time when his calligraphy could be seen everywhere on shop signs, big and small, in Shanghai. He probably realized that those bosses were too picky: if the writing was slightly larger, they would ask for it to be rewritten; if it was slightly smaller, they would also ask for it to be rewritten. Tang felt overwhelmed by the hassle, so he included a scale of measurements with his fee schedule, specifying how much the brush fee would be for each character of a certain size, so that requesters could determine a standard size for themselves. However, this was unique in fee schedules.

### Watching the Tide at Haining

— Zheng Xiaocang

In the eighth month, angry tides roll on the river,
Ten thousand horses gallop, displaying heavenly power.
A thousand fathoms of silver peaks are frightening as they pass,
A hundred zhang of swift currents are seen as already far away.
The crane-like iron shovel cleaves the waves and goes forward,
The carefree egret chases the greasy waves.
In the deep blue, the sea is calm, and tourists make merry,
Straddling iron oxen and blowing short flutes.

### Mr. Hu Yaguang Made a Simple Line Drawing Portrait for Me, Extremely Lifelike. Delighted, I Respond with a Poem and Inscribe it on the Portrait

— Gao Chuiwan

Opening the letter brings a smile,
I recognize my true self.
This skill is beyond skill,
The person is truly wonderful.
With just a few strokes,
The whole spirit is vividly seen.
Ashamed of my poetic and scholarly aura,
It can only convey the appearance of an old rustic.

### Reimbursement

— Dongfang Jibai

After reading Mr. Lao Dan's "Signature and Seal" and Mr. You Mo Jun's "Sealing" in "Freedom Forum," I was reminded of the matter of "reimbursement."

In every organization, large or small, after spending money, it is customary to "prepare a reimbursement report." There are IOUs for borrowing, vouchers for payments, seals required for recipients, notes required for those in debt, and receipts required for buying things. Preparing a reimbursement report requires a "receipt attachment book." Not only must the numbers match, but everything must be firmly documented. The details must be clear and orderly, without a single mistake. It seems flawless and certainly consumes a lot of energy for the office staff, but this entire set of official formalities is just an added inconvenience with no meaning.

"Preparing a reimbursement report" requires an experienced hand to ensure that it is "approved" upon submission. If one reports honestly and openly, one will almost certainly run into trouble. Mildly, one will be reprimanded; severely, one will be punished and given demerits, or even lose one's job. Many "office workers" get a headache when they hear about preparing reimbursement reports, and it is not without reason.

Where does the "experience" of an experienced hand lie? It lies in knowing how to falsify.

In the drawers of experienced hands, there is no shortage of store stamps, personal stamps, large and small, round and square. Whatever kind of receipt is needed for the reimbursement report can be quickly produced and used. This saves time and effort, and the prices can be set at will. If something is missing, the required receipt is written in advance and taken to a merchant to ask them to stamp it, and they will not refuse, as merchants are also well aware of this practice. This is an open secret.

Preparing a "reimbursement report" must comply with the "budget." Any changes are illegal. If the budget for paper and stationery is a certain amount, the reimbursement report must also show that amount. If the budget for postage and telecommunications is a certain amount, the reimbursement report must also show that amount. It cannot be more or less, but must be just right. A thick reimbursement book is full of falsified accounts, which has long become a very common thing. When submitted, the "higher-ups" also know it is false but never investigate. Sometimes, it might be "returned" for rewriting because the numbers do not match, and this continues until they do match. This is simply the "higher-ups" forcing the "lower-downs" to falsify. This practice has been around for a long time, and everyone is used to it; no one has ever questioned, objected, or protested.

The travel expenses for public officials on business trips have specific regulations, but some still need to prepare a reimbursement report after the trip is completed. On a certain day of a certain month, how much was spent on food and how much was spent on transportation must be verified and submitted for approval. Those on business trips also have evidence and documentation, no more and no less, exactly matching the prescribed amount. The reporters are all falsifying, and the supervisors know it but do not ask.

I think there is nothing more "official" than "preparing a reimbursement report." Superiors and subordinates deceive each other without finding it strange, wasting paper, ink, energy, and time on a series of "submission for review" and "approval" official procedures. What is the benefit of this? What does it mean?

I firmly advocate the complete eradication of this reimbursement ideology.

### Odds and Ends

— Xian Si

Germany is experiencing a severe paper shortage. In Berlin, residents who want to obtain a new phone book must not only return the old one but also pay seventeen pounds of waste paper (old newspapers, old books, etc.).

There is a bookbinding expert in New York who pays great attention to the matching of the book's cover and content. For a book specifically about ostriches, he used ostrich skin for the cover. For a book specifically about skin diseases, he used human skin as the cover!

### Slot Machines

— Mao Yi

Although "slot machines" are quite unfamiliar to the Chinese people, they are not completely unknown. During the time when copper coins were in circulation before the war, there was a type of "fortune-telling machine" on the streets of Shanghai. By putting a copper coin into a small hole, a fortune slip would drop out of another hole. This kind of device can also be considered a type of slot machine. This summer, some cold drink shops in Shanghai had slot machines that dispensed Coca-Cola, which can be considered authentic Americanized slot machines.

In today's America, slot machines have become a part of the lives of Americans. Slot machines are set up in theaters, hotels, train stations, other public places, and even on streets and sidewalks. By inserting a coin, one can get cigarettes, candy, gum, peanuts, beer, stamps, and other daily necessities. Some slot machines even provide ice, insurance policies, and even wash clothes. There are as many as 24,000 companies operating slot machines, employing 2 million people.

However, all of this is just the beginning. Many novel slot machines are currently being planned or manufactured. Housewives will be able to buy frozen food from slot machines. Automatic large bill exchange machines will save people from the trouble of not having small bills. Travelers will not only be able to buy train tickets from slot machines but will also be able to buy razor blades with the same convenience. Slot machines will even be able to shine shoes with automatic shoe-shining machines!

Although slot machines are considered a modern invention, their true origins can actually be traced back to 100 to 200 years before the Common Era. When Professor Baynard of London's Woodcroft translated "The Pneumatics of Hero of Alexandria," he discovered that this skillful Egyptian craftsman had already made primitive slot machines. He invented a ritual device: whoever put in five silver coins would have holy water spurt out of the device. This device combined religion and commerce.

### Maotai and Whiskey

— Chen Yixian

Guizhou Maotai liquor has been famous for a long time, and I have always regretted not having tasted it. After the victory, Maotai suddenly flooded the market. I bought a bottle and drank it, but it was not good. It was far inferior to Sichuan's Mianzhu Daqu, so I thought it was merely an overrated name. A few days ago, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, a friend gifted me a bottle of Maotai brought from Kunming. When I opened the bottle and poured the liquor into a cup, a fragrant aroma wafted into my nose. Tasting it, it had a slightly bitter taste, but after a while, it turned sweet on the palate, and the fragrance was rich and unmatched by other liquors. At the same time, a friend from Beiping sent a package of jujubes. They were deep red, slightly pointed at both ends, not very large, and the pits were extremely small. Every one was free of worms. I used them to accompany the Maotai liquor. The liquor was fragrant and strong, and the jujubes had the three qualities of being fresh, crisp, and sweet. They were indeed the jujubes from Langjiayuan in Beiping. (Langjiayuan is located in western Beijing and is famous for producing jujubes.) In "Water Margin," Wu Yong cleverly obtained birthday gifts by adding anesthesia to white wine and serving it with a large bowl of fresh jujubes, which drugged Yang Zhi and his men, allowing him to steal gold and jewels. It can be seen that good liquor and good jujubes can move people.

My friend from Kunming said, "Maotai Village is located in Renhuai County, Guizhou. It is a mountainous area, and the liquor is made with stream water, similar to how Shaoxing wine is made with the water of Jian Lake. Old wine is not good without Jian Lake water, and Maotai is not pure and rich without mountain stream water. In the past, Maotai had cellars that were over a hundred years old. The winemakers passed down the tradition of mixing wheat and other ingredients into the fermentation pits, which had to be left for two full years before being opened for sale. Also, due to inconvenient transportation, it could not be sold far away, so the supply exceeded the demand, and the old wine accumulated more and more. That is why the name of Maotai became famous throughout the world. More than ten years ago, when Zhu and Mao led their forces to break out of their old nest in Ruijin, Jiangxi, and passed through the provinces of Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Sichuan to northern Shaanxi, Maotai was right on their route. All the old cellars were destroyed. Now, Maotai liquor is all produced from new cellars. In addition, more is being transported out by road and air, so the demand exceeds the supply. Some cellars are opened in less than two years, so Maotai liquor is not as good as it used to be. The bottle I sent is old cellar liquor, which is not easy to buy even in Kunming."

Two days after the Mid-Autumn Festival (September 19), my brother Cui Yunsheng invited me to drink at his Shenli Wine Shop. The dishes were Fujian cuisine, and the liquor was aged whiskey. The weather was extremely hot that day, no less than in midsummer. Everyone had a large glass in front of them, filled one-quarter with liquor, and then topped off with ice soda or lemonade. I drank the first glass in one gulp, and a coolness spread throughout my body. The aroma of the liquor was not as good as Maotai, but it was more refreshing. This is a special strength of foreign liquor. Because the liquor had been aged for many years, the taste was extremely pure and rich. Those who gathered together that day included Zhou Soujuan, Fan Yanqiao, Li Zukui, Gan Jingxian (the younger brother of the late Mr. Yuan), Pan Zixin, and Shen Xieshen. All the talents were present, and the host and guests enjoyed the best of southeastern China. We unconsciously raised our glasses frequently, and I ended up quite drunk. It had been twelve years since I had such a hearty drink after July 7th. Whiskey comes from Scotland in England and is made from wheat, the same as Maotai. French brandy is made from grapes, our old wine is made from glutinous rice, and Yanghe Daqu is made from sorghum. These liquors use different raw materials, but all aged ones are good and have their own special flavors. This Mid-Autumn Festival, I had the opportunity to taste two kinds of famous liquors, both Chinese and foreign, within three days, and I must record it.

Social Services

### Explanation from the Port Quarantine Station: Shanghai Port Epidemic Prevention Measures

Received your institution's Social Services Department's letter regarding reader Yang Wanyou's suggestions for quarantine work. We forwarded the original document to the relevant department for review. We are grateful for your kind attention. Here are the replies to Mr. Yang's original opinions, categorized as follows: (1) The Ministry of Health approved the vaccination fees in its July 20 order, 防 (37) 字 No. 12931. Item 16 of the fee adjustment table stipulates that the fee for a vaccination certificate is 100,000 Legal Tender yuan per certificate. To promote vaccination work, our station temporarily reduces the fee to 60,000 yuan. The current charge of 3 Gold Yuan cents is only equivalent to 90,000 yuan, which has not yet reached the standard set by the Ministry. (2) Smallpox is still being discovered in Shanghai, which remains a smallpox epidemic port. According to the seaport quarantine procedures, travelers still need to be vaccinated against smallpox to prevent the spread of infection to other locations. (3) Vaccination hours are currently from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 1:30 PM to 5:00 PM, and 5:00 PM to 12:00 AM. Please take note of the above information! Shanghai Seaport Quarantine Station of the Ministry of Health. September 14.
