### Women Governing; World Peace; Sun Ke Addresses Women National Assembly Representatives at Banquet

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Vice Chairman Sun and his wife hosted a banquet for all the women National Assembly representatives on the 11th, delivering a speech on the women's issue in China. He first recounted the women's movements in countries such as the Soviet Union, the United States, and France, as well as the legislative process for women's equality under the law after the establishment of the Republic of China. He then stated that the women's rights in our country today have surpassed those of advanced countries such as Britain and the United States. The number of female members in the US Federal Congress and the British Parliament is very small, while our National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan after the implementation of the Constitution both have more than one-fourth of female National Assembly representatives and legislators. In this regard, Sun advocated that the number of women in various departments such as the Executive Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Examination Yuan should also be stipulated by law. He also believed that it is not enough for women to only strive for political rights at the central level. He advocated that when each province formulates its own autonomous provincial constitution in the future, there should also be clear regulations on women's participation in local political power. Finally, Sun proposed in an impassioned tone that if women were to rule the country and the world, the country would be peaceful and the world would have peace. He said that during World War I, US President Wilson proposed a slogan for the US's participation in the war: "To end war with war," believing that after the end of World War I, the world could achieve peace from then on. But the result was not as Wilson imagined. World War II broke out not long after. Therefore, he said that if the world is still ruled by men in the future, the world will never have peace. Only when women are in power can the country be stable and the world have peace, because women do not like to fight wars, they love their families, they love their children, and they love peace most. Governing the country with this kind of mentality will naturally prevent the recurrence of war. After Sun's speech, the women representatives spoke one after another, expressing their support and hoping for his success in the vice presidential election, in order to realize his vision of women governing the country and saving world peace.

### Li Zongren's Election Speech at Guangxi University Alumni Reception; Talking Freely About the Struggle of Two Ideologies

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] The Guangxi University Alumni Association in Beijing held a tea party on the 11th in the auditorium of the Youth Corps Headquarters, inviting Li Zongren. Huang Xuchu, Li Yunhua, Lei Yinyin, Chen Jiantiao, and over a hundred others attended. Li gave a speech, briefly stating that Guangxi University was founded and grew up in hardship and difficulty, but has not reached the ideal level. He said: "I have always attached great importance to education. When I was the chairman of the Wuhan Political Branch during the 17th year of the Republic [1928], I allocated 200,000 yuan from extremely difficult financial circumstances as the start-up funding for Wuhan University. The Xiang and E Provinces banks also helped to raise funds at that time in order to establish it. This is enough to prove that I have never neglected the construction of education, culture, and economy." After Li recounted Guangxi's contributions to the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance, he stated that for the future of China, he believes that military affairs should be the short-term solution, and political and economic reforms should be the fundamental solution. He also said: "This reform must start from the central government, so those responsible for the central government should not only have the determination to reform, but also have correct and appropriate plans. My motives for participating in the vice presidential election are to advocate for a democratic atmosphere and to fulfill my sense of responsibility to the country. I am willing to use my experience of over 30 years in military and political work to assist the head of state and start from the central government to engage in thorough reform. If I am elected vice president, I am willing to be a bridge between the people and the government, so that the opinions of all parties can be conveyed to the head of state for adoption." Li continued: "The struggle against the Communist bandits is not a simple military struggle, but a political struggle, that is, the struggle between the Three Principles of the People and Communism. Therefore, if we cannot implement the Three Principles of the People, even if we defeat the Communist bandits, we will not be able to obtain unanimous support. As for the Principle of People's Livelihood, the equalization of land ownership and the regulation of capital have not only failed to be implemented today, but powerful families and capital have taken the opportunity to rise, accumulating vast wealth, turning the Chinese society from a division of large and small poverty into a phenomenon where the poor become poorer and the rich become richer. Therefore, today, it is not enough to clear out the capital of powerful families to appease public anger and to show the government's determination to reform the economy. I also believe that this political and economic reform movement is a unanimous demand of the whole country, so it will inevitably be successful, and it will inevitably achieve the goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the country through political and economic reforms." Finally, Li analyzed the future international situation and said that China's future foreign policy must adhere to the principle of independence and autonomy, and internally it must eliminate the Communist bandits and maintain China's non-Communist status, and then serve as the mainstay for safeguarding Asian security.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] Regarding the issue of the use of US$463 million in US aid, it is still awaiting decision. In addition to the US$125 million to be used entirely for the purchase of military supplies, the remaining US$338 million will be used to formulate a list of materials to be purchased based on the needs of economic construction. However, the quotas of the relevant agencies are still to be agreed upon.

### Chen Cheng Earnestly Resigns from His Current Position; About to Go to the United States for Medical Treatment; Decides to Ask the Chairman for Instructions Before Departure

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Regarding the illness of Chief of Staff Chen Cheng, all parties are very concerned. The reporter specially visited Lin Kesheng, director of the Military Medical Department of the Ministry of National Defense, who told him that Chen had suffered from duodenal ulcer in the past. After being ordered to go to the Northeast in September last year, he overworked himself due to the heavy responsibility and cold climate. In less than three weeks, his old illness relapsed. Later, due to overwork while ill, the illness worsened. Lin continued that when Chairman Chiang personally inspected the Northeast in January this year, he witnessed Chen's illness and knew that it was impossible to recover without moving to another place for recuperation, so he decided to reassign Wei Lihuang to take over and ordered Chen to return south. Chen returned to Beijing in early February and went to the US military hospital for examination. The results showed that it was impossible to fully recover without a longer period of recuperation. Chen then went to Shanghai at the end of February for intermittent treatment. Lin also said that the results of Chen's illness examination have been reported to Chairman Chiang at any time.

The reporter then asked about Chen's trip abroad for treatment, which has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers and is of concern to all parties, and wondered when it would be possible to go.

He plans to go to the United States for fundamental treatment. Before going to the United States, he also plans to return to Beijing to ask the Chairman for instructions and it is heard that he has earnestly resigned from his current position.

### The Main Trend of Hebei Politics

— Our Reporter Yang Bingsen

[Our Newspaper Baoding Eighth Dispatch] The situation in Hebei today is quite unusual, with provincial affairs presenting a multitude of complexities. However, a glimmer of hope has emerged, indicating how to start the work. Chu Xichun, the Chairman of Hebei Province, clearly understands the crux of the provincial administration and thus dares to have confidence, acting as soon as he knows. I remember that when Mr. Chu took office more than two months ago, he first announced a minimum and most practical and essential provincial administration implementation outline. The first central task of provincial administration is to fully support military development with political power, and he emphasized: The goal of administrative facilities is the people, rights should belong to the people, benefits should accrue to the people, we must promote politics with military force, consolidate the people's power with politics, and seek comprehensive development with the people's power, nurturing points and lines with the comprehensive, and then supporting the comprehensive with points and lines, advancing in different ways.

Military-Political Coordination

The main task of military-political coordination is to support local teams with regular troops, to support people's self-defense organizations with local teams, that is, to coordinate the people's self-defense forces with local teams, and to support regular troops with teams, in a mutually cyclical coordination, to eliminate the communist bandits. In terms of organizing and training the masses, it is necessary to reach the point where everyone is a soldier in times of trouble and everyone is a civilian in times of peace. Under the principle of unconditional full administrative cooperation with the military, in addition to regular troops, the provincial government plans to establish 22 security regiments throughout the province, two-thirds of the funds for which will be provided by the central government and one-third by local resources. In addition, guerrilla suppression teams will be established in the inspectorate commissioner districts to be responsible for directing the security teams to carry out guerrilla suppression tasks. Clean-up teams will be established in each county to undertake the task of clearing out remaining bandits within the county area, without moving. As for the grassroots organizations in the countryside, people's self-defense teams will be established, but they will not be allowed to break away from production. The current administrative work in Hebei Province is fully and actively unfolding in this direction.

Land Review

In order to counter the communist bandits' "land policy" and "locust policy," the Hebei authorities are using organization against organization, and using the people and methods to launch the land policy of "land to the tillers" and the "refugee reclamation movement." At the recent Hebei military-political review meeting, it was decided to gradually implement livelihood policies in the recovered areas, starting with the distribution of land. "Land Rights Equalization Committees" have been universally established in various counties to be responsible for implementation, but the committee is entirely composed of owner-farmers and tenant farmers, handling the distribution of land that has been illegally handled. Although the ownership of landlords is preserved in principle, except for those with self-cultivation ability, all others are distributed to tenant farmers, and land bonds are issued, guaranteed by the government, for tenant farmers to pay off the land price within fifteen or twenty years, but without interest. However, landlords who do not participate in the bandit suppression work will no longer have their ownership recognized, but will be confiscated and made public. Factories and mines will also be managed by workers, who will also receive profits, to ensure that the middle class is protected, the lower class is supported, and the upper class is restricted, so that the poor can become rich, the rich can be at peace, and everyone can work together for production.

Refugee Reclamation

At the same time, in order to thoroughly relieve the refugees and eliminate the communist bandits' "locust policy" and to encourage refugees to engage in production, the Hebei Provincial Government has decided to launch a refugee reclamation movement. Recently, the Relief Association and the Social Affairs Department have reached an agreement with the Hebei Reclamation Farm and the Hebei Provincial Agricultural Field Bureau, deciding to allocate 10,000 mu of cultivated wasteland in Chadian, east of Tianjin, and Junchang. All good people from the counties under the province who are refugees and have agricultural production skills can participate in this reclamation work, and three thousand households will be selected in Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, and Tangshan and transported to the two places in batches to form cooperative farms composed of refugees. The methods are: (1) After the refugees arrive at the destination, the responsible party will borrow temples, schools, and empty houses for them to live in; (2) Refugees apply for land, temporarily limited to five mu per person or ten mu per household; (3) Those who apply for cultivated land can obtain permanent tenancy rights, but must participate in self-cultivation and must not hire workers or sublet to others. In addition, agricultural tools will be provided and the necessary production materials will be distributed.

Spring Famine Relief

Due to years of banditry, the rural areas of Hebei Province are generally experiencing a serious spring famine. Liu Yaozhang, the Speaker of the Hebei Provisional Council, recently inspected the Pinghan and Beining roads and the suburbs of Pingjin, and said publicly: If this year's spring cultivation problem (including able-bodied men, livestock, farm tools, fertilizers, seeds, and production costs) is not solved, I believe that next year's food panic will inevitably double, and people's lives will be unimaginable. He believes that we should quickly disperse the able-bodied men concentrated in cities or county towns back to engage in production, and the central and local governments should jointly find ways to provide relief or subsidies in terms of livestock, farm tools, fertilizers, seeds, and production costs as much as possible. In addition, we can use work relief methods to engage in well digging and canal opening.

In order to thoroughly relieve the spring famine, the Hebei Provincial Government is actively handling agricultural loans and cotton loans. This year, the province's agricultural loans have been approved for 230.5 billion yuan from the Agricultural Bank, and another 101.5 billion yuan will be distributed by the Central Cooperative Treasury, of which 75 billion yuan will be used as food production loans, 100 billion yuan will be used as cotton loans, 14 billion yuan will be used for small-scale water conservancy projects, and a total of 41.5 billion yuan will be used for other agricultural production and land loans.

Grasping the Driving Force

General Fu Zuoyi recently said very sincerely: Although the current situation in Hebei is very serious, we are not pessimistic. On the other hand, it is also an opportunity for development, as long as we can grasp the driving force of the new development. Where is the power of new development? That is the people. In the bandit areas, we must rely on the power of military-political coordination to save the people. In the national army areas, we must strive for local stability. The provincial government must seek development based on the demands of the people and the interests of the people. Therefore, the current Hebei provincial administration is doing everything possible to win the trust and love of the people and mobilize all the people's strength to engage in the work of suppressing bandits and restoring order.

### Special Article: On the Importance of Independent Exploration

— Liu Xian

Since Renault's farcical escape back to the United States, academic circles in our country have expressed indignation and advocated completing the exploration of the Jishi Mountains independently. The Central Aviation Corporation is also willing to send a special plane from Shanghai or Nanjing to Lanzhou at no cost to carry exploration personnel and exploration equipment to the Jishi Mountains to complete the unfinished work of the Renault expedition. However, due to practical difficulties, the plan for independent exploration had to be temporarily abandoned, and members of our country's exploration team have successively returned to Nanjing from Lanzhou. We cannot help but express our regret for this matter and hope that our scientific community will continue to work hard. I have long advocated independent exploration and hope to expand the scope of independent exploration in the future. I would like to say a word to the Chinese scientific community on this issue.

When the so-called "Renault Expedition" came to China in late January this year, I, based on the standpoint of a scientist, wrote an article entitled "On the Arrival of the Renault Expedition in China" because the matter was abrupt and the behavior was unlike a scientific expedition. It was published in the "Weekly Forum" of this newspaper on February 2. First, it pointed out that the organization of the team was unsound, the nature and purpose were unclear, the itinerary date was uncertain, the team members were uncoordinated, and the supply of materials was not well prepared. It was predicted early that "it is inevitable to be unprepared." Second, it was argued that Renault was a businessman with no exploration experience. After coming to China, he promoted "atomic pens" everywhere. Therefore, it was confirmed that "the team has a strong commercial advertising color, rather than a purely scientific exploration." Finally, it cited previous foreign expeditions to China, where "they did not abide by the agreement or our country's laws, and disputes arose." Be cautious from the beginning. My humble opinion may be alarmist, but I also hope to arouse the attention of our country's scientific authorities. I have no other purpose, but I was not clearly understood. Instead, friends spread rumors that "the matter is related to Sino-US scientific cooperation, and those who do not know the content should not make wild comments." I believe that in this democratic era, freedom of speech is enshrined in the constitution. Everyone loves their country, just like me. "Only officials are allowed to light lamps" is regrettable.

Now, this long-publicized "Sino-US Jishi Mountain Exploration Team," after several delays, has become unbearable. On April 1, Renault unilaterally tore up the exploration plan due to his non-compliance with the "agreement." Our side's attempt to cooperate in the exploration, after several preparations, ended without success, not only costing a lot of money but also giving the Chinese team members a major mental blow, which should arouse the indignation of the Chinese people. Renault also disregarded our country's laws, undermined sovereignty, and violated international air law by privately flying away, with various illegal actions emerging one after another, like a legendary drama, scene after scene. Regardless of Renault's dishonorable behavior, which has become a laughingstock at home and abroad and will be subject to sanctions in his own country, this kind of scam is a great joke. It is exploration in name, but smuggling in reality. For our country, especially the scientific community, it is a great insult. At the same time, it is also a major stain on the American scientific community. Our country's scientific community should express a solemn statement to avoid the recurrence of similar Renault incidents. The fair remarks made by Mr. Shekai, President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, on the 5th of this month are greatly appreciated. The development of the incident to this point is no longer a purely scientific cooperation and exploration issue. Regarding the destruction of laws and the infringement of sovereignty, it should be resolved through proper diplomatic channels. As for how to negotiate and how to deal with the aftermath, the authorities should be able to handle it well. We "do not know the content" and do not dare to say more, otherwise, it will only increase the feeling of "unfortunately, the prediction came true."

Learning from the past, we should be careful in the future. After being deceived in this way, we don't know whether to laugh or cry. In the future, when we encounter similar international cooperation incidents, we should "be cautious in our actions and avoid repeating the same mistakes." Furthermore, we deeply feel the importance of independence and self-reliance. Cooperation is sometimes unreliable. Now, in order to implement the Jishi Mountain exploration, we should make persistent efforts, expand the organization, redeploy, and continue to proceed. The Academia Sinica should still take overall leadership, and the Ministry of Education, National Defense, Agriculture and Forestry, Water Conservancy, Economy, and Resources should cooperate and assist. Mobilize scientific organizations such as the Science Society of China, the Chinese Society of Natural Sciences, the Central Geological Survey, the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute, and the Chinese Geological, Geographical, Meteorological, Physical, Animal, Botanical, Mineral, and Ethnic Societies, and related agencies should participate as one. Request the Air Force Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense to borrow special exploration planes and pilots, and concentrate on the scientific instruments needed, such as radar. Such a large-scale exploration of the western mountainous area through concerted efforts will surely be successful and is necessary. The significance of this time and place is extraordinary. First, it can show the independence of Chinese science and technology and that external force is not necessary. Second, it can wash away the shame of this incident and correct the international perception. Third, it can make a real academic contribution, determine the height of the main peak of Jishi Mountain, and permanently preserve its original name. It is beneficial in many ways and should not be hesitated. Twelve academic groups in Lanzhou also have suggestions for independent exploration, which shows that people of insight in the scientific community have similar views. I hope that the scientific authorities will actively carry out and organize it in a timely manner.

Not only that, scientific exploration can increase human knowledge and develop natural resources. All observations of astronomy and meteorology, investigations of mountains, rivers, and geology, exploration of the oceans, searches for animals, plants, and minerals, and interviews of races and customs are the responsibility of scientific explorers. Therefore, the sky is the limit, and the sea is boundless, reaching far and wide, exploring the strange and seeking the new, and inspiring the mysterious. Scientifically advanced countries have done this for the most part, and the achievements have been particularly remarkable in the last three hundred years. The North and South Poles have been visited by explorers. Our country's people are usually cautious and mature at a young age, lacking a spirit of adventure. Not to mention distant places, even the famous mountains and rivers, border areas, and hinterland of our country have not been explored, so that great resources are abandoned on the ground, and the people's livelihood is scarce.

Our country is blessed by nature, located in the cold, temperate, and tropical zones, with vast land and abundant resources, varying from north to south, with different climates and many ethnic groups. Science is developing late, and research is not yet complete. For the current plan, we should first organize various survey, inspection, exploration, collection, visit, and investigation teams to go to various places, especially the border areas, to conduct detailed field research. As for mountain exploration, which has not been heard of in our country before, we should encourage and reward young scientists, provide them with specialized training, and send them to the Pamirs, Himalayas, Altai, Tianshan, and Hinggan Mountains to conduct various scientific studies, not just the Jishi Mountains. However, overall planning depends on a central agency to manage the matter, and the organization of the Chinese Exploration Association is urgently needed to concentrate manpower and financial resources to make it easier to achieve the goal. In view of this, I am ashamed of my insignificance and wrote an article entitled "Exploration, Development, and Scientific Research" (published in "Science," Volume 29, Issue 8, August 1947, published by the Science Society of China) to call for it. I hope that government authorities, social elites, and scientific experts will understand the importance of exploration and development for the great cause of nation-building, jointly launch it, and quickly promote it. It is not only the fortune of science, but also the blessing of the country. And this time Renault's breach of contract and bad faith will not only harm us, but may also promote the development of our country's exploration cause. "A blessing in disguise."

### Chongqing reporters arrive in Wanyuan to inspect the defenses of the Daba Mountains

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] Yang Zishou and four other reporters from Chongqing set off from Chongqing on the 6th and arrived in Wanyuan, the main peak of the Daba Mountains, on the 9th. The mission of the reporter group is to investigate the defense situation of the Daba Mountains on the spot, and the scheduled trip is two weeks.

[Central News Agency, Wanyuan, 10th] The reporter arrived in Wanyuan by car with Division Commander Fang in the afternoon of the 9th. The county is an important city connecting the Daba Mountains, surrounded by high mountains, and the terrain is dangerous. In 1935, the communist bandit Xu Xiangqian occupied the county for more than a year. The county originally had more than 300,000 residents, but after the massacre by Xu's bandits, there are now only more than 100,000 residents, and most of them are people who moved from Shaanxi and Hubei. The county residents have tasted the brutality of the communist bandits in the past and hate them to the bone. Therefore, the anti-communist consciousness is very strong. In order to prevent the intrusion of the communist bandits, a self-defense committee has been established. Wanyuan has a vast area and sparse population, and there is more wasteland than cultivated land, so there are very few disputes between tenant farmers and landlords. This reporter traveled from the Yu-Han Highway through Linshui and Dazhu to Wanyuan and deeply felt that the closer to the Daba Mountains, the more stable the people's hearts became.

### Food Shortage, Inconvenient Transportation, Stagnant Fishing Industry - Three Major Difficulties in Penghu - County Government Requests Scientific Investigation Team to Appeal on Their Behalf

[Central News Agency, Penghu, 11th] The Penghu Scientific Investigation Team is currently divided into groups to conduct investigations on various islands and is scheduled to return to Kaohsiung on the 15th. The Penghu County Government recently sent a memorandum to the team, outlining the three major difficulties in the county and requesting them to appeal on their behalf: (1) Penghu produces no rice. Even in good years, agricultural products such as sweet potatoes and sorghum are only enough for four months of consumption. Last year, there was both drought and typhoon, making the shortage even more severe, and cries of hunger are heard everywhere. The total population of Penghu County is over 34,000 people. Calculating a minimum ration of 15 catties per person per month, over 1 million catties of rice are needed. With a grain shortage for eight months of the year, 9 million catties of rice are needed annually, which must rely on supplies from Taiwan Island. (2) Penghu's transportation relies solely on four small vessels with a load capacity of 20 tons. In winter, the winds are fierce, and often transportation is cut off for a month. Among the county's 64 islands, transportation to each island is also hindered by a lack of ships, and official documents and government orders cannot arrive for over a month. The Penghu Motor Company originally provided land transportation, but due to a lack of gasoline, all routes are currently suspended. (3) The Penghu ice factory, fish market, fishing port oil depot, and shipyard were damaged during the war and have not yet been restored. Furthermore, fishing boats and fishing gear are difficult to replace, leading to a stagnant fishing industry. Although there is a vocational school for fisheries, most graduates are unemployed.

### Wuxi "Heroin Gang" Active - Sending Fake Wedding Invitations to Extort Money

[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 10th] Recently, a beautiful wedding invitation suddenly appeared in the city, stating that Feng Yunchu's son, Guoliang, was to marry Ms. Qian Sujuan on April 8th at the Kangle Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai. The return addresses on the envelopes included the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shen Bao editorial department, the Central Trust Bureau, the China Transportation Company, and No. 133 Xinsheng Road, Wuxi. Various factories, shops, and those acquainted with Mr. Feng in the city received these invitations and sent gifts. By the evening of the 7th, Mr. Feng received news in Shanghai and immediately telegraphed the Wuxi Daily to request the publication of an advertisement denying the event, exposing this fraudulent scheme to extort money, and informing relatives and friends not to be deceived. However, because Mr. Feng has a wide circle of friends and acquaintances, friends, relatives, and heads of institutions in Wuxi had already sent gifts on the 6th and 7th, and were left both laughing and crying upon seeing yesterday's advertisement. As this case has attracted considerable attention from the community, the reporter made a special trip to Xinsheng Road yesterday to investigate. It is understood that the case was perpetrated by a "heroin gang." The person in charge is Qian Zixin, the landlord of the premises, whose father, Qian Hemei, was previously detained by the county government due to a drug case. Fortunately, the discovery was made early, and the police have already arrested the perpetrators. However, the main culprit and his accomplices have all fled.

### United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information - A Chaotic Scene

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Mao Shuqing

Representatives Shouting, Chairman Gaveling

[This Newspaper, Geneva, 1st] As the Conference on Freedom of Information progressed, many national representatives began to feel fatigue, monotony, and boredom, like the feeling of "fatigue bombing." Mr. Cheng Cangbo was the first to feel annoyed by those debates that lacked news value and focused on the diplomatic nature of the "two fronts." He walked ten minutes back to the hotel from the meeting every day, eating while shouting "Nonsense." William Tyferry, a colleague from the U.S., special correspondent for the European edition of the New York Herald Tribune, also kept saying "Boring, boring." I saw that his telegram back to Paris said: "The two fronts are too distinct, like thousands upon thousands of other international conferences, with little hope of achievement."

Young Representatives Complaining

However, although the interest in the conference hall was not intense, the verbal jousting never subsided. After the artillery fire from the Netherlands, the young representative from Romania followed suit and complained in the First Committee. He strongly criticized the absurd and outrageous reports in the New York Herald Tribune, which he said infringed on Romania's national interests. He said: "British and American journalists never arrive in Romania with good intentions." He said that an American Christian Science Monitor reporter named Magen wrote reports that were full of insults to Romania, not only reactionary but also capitalist running dogs and war profiteers. He said: British and American newspapers have never reported on the economic recovery and construction of Southeast Europe. Their reporters in Romania enjoy full freedom and protection, but they never pick the good aspects to write about, and only make friends with people who oppose the government, using their rumors and lies as news material.

The Romanian representative also said: Government control of the news media is not necessarily a bad thing; the main thing is to see whether the government is democratic or fascist. The Greek representative believed that Romania intended to openly insult them. He said: "The Greek government was legally elected by the people. It is a democratic government." He urged the conference to pay attention to who are the lovers of peace and who are the aggressors. The Romanian delegation deliberately laughed loudly, and the chairman banged the gavel, creating a chaotic scene. The Czech representative stood up loudly and shouted: "The Greek representative has raised a point of order; he himself is a disruptor of order!" The Yugoslav representative said: "If the Greek representative feels insulted, then please, Chairman, pay attention to the insult the American representative made to the Czech Republic on the first day!" Several other representatives wanted to join the "melee." The clever chairman of the subcommittee announced a "recess" in the midst of the uproar.

Who Strangles Freedom of Information

The next day, the British chief representative, McLean, gave a very vivid speech in which he thoroughly condemned the "Slavic bloc countries" for strangling freedom of information. On the other hand, he spoke extensively about the history of the British struggle for freedom of information. Then he spoke of the British idea of freedom of information. He said that British society regards newspapers as a kind of free enterprise. Newspaper owners, editors, and reporters are like the owners, clerks, and workers of a company. They all have union relations with each other. They value their reputation and cherish their profession. Newspapers can report freely and express opinions freely. The government never controls or guides them, but because there is more than one newspaper, there is an opportunity for mutual correction and mutual rebuttal. He said: "For example, if London's conservative Daily Mail makes a mistake in its news reporting or exaggerates its opinions excessively, the Labour Party's London Daily Herald will definitely criticize or rebut it. Conversely, if the Daily Herald is wrong, the Daily Mail will also criticize it!" He said humorously: "Even if neither newspaper is wrong, the Communist Daily Worker will definitely refute them!" The whole venue burst into laughter.

Basic Concepts and Distinctions

"But," McLean said passionately, "If Moscow's Pravda makes a mistake in its reporting, who will correct it? Who will criticize it?" He said: This is the fundamental distinction between freedom of information and lack of freedom. He wanted the representatives of the Slavic bloc to calmly examine this fundamental concept.

McLean and the U.S. delegation shared the view that the conference should sign a convention on the concept of freedom of information that would be jointly observed by the world.

The Proposal on Passport Visas

The U.S. delegation put forward a major proposal in the Second Committee regarding the issue of passport visas for foreign journalists, as well as freedom of travel and freedom of access to information, which sparked a very heated debate. The Yugoslav representative, Dedijer, said that the U.S. representative was slapping himself in the face. "Why does the U.S. government repeatedly refuse visa requests from reporters for Communist newspapers?" Dedijer cited the story of the refusal of a visa to a reporter from the Paris "Humanité" (Communist newspaper) as evidence. The debate was then joined by representatives from Poland, the United Kingdom, India, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, and France. Deng Youde, the Chinese representative to the Second Committee, supported the U.S. proposal and stated that the Chinese government has always given foreign journalists the greatest convenience in entering and leaving the country. Because he spoke in Chinese, he aroused considerable interest from the entire venue amid the weary debate. (At the Strasbourg Hotel)

### A Retired Soldier in Wuxi - Buys Lard and Causes Disaster - Beats Meat Merchant to Death with Iron Rod

[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 10th] Chen Peide, the owner of Chen Xingji Meat Shop in Qiangou Town, Xixiang, had a conflict with a retired soldier stationed there over the purchase of lard on the morning of the 8th. Unexpectedly, not long after, he was suddenly beaten to death by dozens of burly men wielding iron rods and other weapons. His ribs were also broken. The manner of his death was extremely tragic. After this incident occurred, the town's merchants and residents were all indignant and went on strike collectively. They also sent representatives to the county government to petition, resolving to report the matter to the command headquarters for a thorough investigation. On the morning of the 10th, the local court specially dispatched Prosecutor Zhu to lead a coroner to the village for an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that the deceased was covered in injuries, his ribs were broken, and his lower back was the most severely injured. It was determined that he had been beaten to death. After the autopsy, the family was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial and await further investigation. Also, when her husband was being beaten, the deceased's wife saw a large man strike down with an iron rod. She used her right hand to block it, but unfortunately, it struck the tiger's mouth between her index finger, causing it to split open on the spot, with blood flowing freely. It is reported that the military authorities will severely punish the troublemakers.

### Soviet Union Uses Veto Again - Blocks Italy from Joining United Nations - Has Caused Profound Reaction in Rome - Burma's Application for Membership Unanimously Approved by Security Council

[United Press, Lake Success, 10th] After the Security Council voted nine to two today to approve Italy's application for membership, the Soviet Union exercised its veto power to cancel it. This is the 23rd time the Soviet Union has used its veto power in the Security Council, and the third time it has used its veto power to block Italy's application for membership. This move occurred just one week before Italy's general election on the 18th of this month, and is worthy of serious attention. The Security Council has decided not to continue voting on the applications for membership of Ireland, Portugal, Jordan, Finland, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and Outer Mongolia, and will report the situation to the United Nations General Assembly, explaining that although the Security Council has re-examined the matter, the members have not changed their position from last year.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 10th] After Soviet representative Gromyko vetoed Italy's application to join the United Nations in the Security Council, U.S. representative to the Security Council Austin said afterwards that he would propose a system to give countries that have applied to join the United Nations and have already obtained the necessary majority support in the General Assembly and the Security Council the status of "associate members," allowing them to attend discussions on matters related to their country, but without the right to vote. Austin also stated that although this proposal arose because of the "unfair" treatment of Italy, it could still be applied to Portugal, Austria, Ireland, Jordan, and Finland, which have received the support of a large majority of members of the Security Council.

[Associated Press, Rome, 10th] The reaction in Italian political circles to the Soviet Union's veto of Italy's accession to the United Nations was both swift and indignant, and undoubtedly a serious blow to the Communists on the eve of the election. The government said, "This was expected, but we still thought that the Soviet Union would not reject Italy for the third time on the eve of the general election, and let the Communists explain it themselves." The Communist Party had already indicated that it would support the Soviet veto unless the Soviet satellite states were also allowed to join at the same time. Political observers pointed out that because of the Soviet veto, all parties condemned the Italian Communist Party, and patriotic sentiment had reached a post-war peak. People were unwilling to listen to arguments in defense of the Soviet Union.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 10th] The Security Council today passed a resolution, with ten votes in favor and one abstention from Argentina, allowing Burma to become the 58th member state of the United Nations organization. Burma's application to join the United Nations was proposed by Chinese representative Xia Jinlin and was unanimously and enthusiastically supported by France, Britain, Belgium, Syria, Canada, and other countries. When submitting the proposal, the Chinese representative strongly stated that the economic and cultural ties between China and Burma are becoming increasingly strong. The Argentine representative stated that he was willing to abstain because he had not received instructions from his government.

### Italian Election Battle - Enters Final Week - Nation Steps Up Security to Prevent Incidents

[Associated Press, Rome, 11th] Italy, amidst an atmosphere of nervous anticipation, has entered the final week of the heated election campaign. Small-scale violence has occurred sporadically in a wide range of areas, and the general fear that small sparks can start a prairie fire has made the situation even more tense. At the same time, it is generally believed that both the communist and non-communist sides will do their best to make surprising moves at the last minute before the general election next Sunday to win votes. The communist front is also planning two major national events that could cause disputes. The Communist Party, on the pretext of mourning the 36 union leaders who were assassinated in Sicily in the past two years, ordered a one-hour nationwide work stoppage on the 11th. The communist front also decided to convene a general meeting of representatives of unemployed workers from trade unions across the country on the 14th.

[Reuters, Rome, 10th] The 11th is the last Sunday before Italy's general election on April 18th. Both the communist and anti-communist parties will hold meetings in major cities that day to make final campaign preparations. Military and police have been ordered to step up security to prevent incidents. The conference at the Milari Lego Theatre on the morning of the 11th will be addressed by Foreign Minister Sforza. In the afternoon, the Communist Party will hold a mass meeting in the cathedral square in the city, with addresses by General Cardona, commander of the Italian partisans during the war, and Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti. Three months ago, the Communist Party was in great momentum, with frequent strikes, and communist armed personnel even set up roadblocks and controlled grain transportation. This situation is now rare, and the Communist Party's power has gradually weakened. The main reason for this is that the Marshall Plan has had a psychological effect. [Reuters, London, 10th] Rome Radio reported that the British, French, and American Standing Bureau in Germany has issued special exit permits to Italians in Germany to enable them to return to their country to participate in the general election.

### The Czechoslovak Socialist Party is Only Accused of Engaging in Underground Activities

[Central News Agency, Prague, 10th (United Press)] The police authorities here have accused 46 former members of the Czechoslovak Socialist Party of engaging in underground activities and treason. They have separately issued public announcements listing the names of three groups of those arrested and the indictments. Two of the groups are accused of printing illegal newspapers and pamphlets. It is reported that this is the first time since the February Czechoslovak coup that the existence of an underground organization in the country has been acknowledged.

[United Press, London, 10th] Since the Czechoslovak Communist Party seized power, thousands of democratic fighters have risked crossing the tightly guarded borders to escape abroad, including former Communist Minister of Health Beruhaste, Slovak Cabinet Prime Minister Lertiks, four Secretaries-General, and 19 Members of Parliament.

### Purge of the Greek Navy

Communist-instigated Mutiny Fails

[United Press, Athens, 10th] The Navy Department announced that a Communist conspiracy to incite a mutiny in the Greek Navy has been uncovered and 116 people have been arrested. The announcement stated that the plan included sinking ships. All those arrested have been handed over to a military tribunal for trial, and another 24 are on the run and will be tried in absentia.

### Two U.S. Warships to Protect South Korean Elections

Land and Air Forces Will Be on Alert

[United Press, Seoul, 11th] It is reported that when general elections are held in the U.S. military-occupied area of South Korea on May 10, two U.S. warships will be stationed in Korean ports. It is expected that all U.S. ground forces will be on alert and air force exercises will be conducted. The purpose of the U.S. military's show of force is to eliminate disturbances caused by leftists during the voting. The two warships will be dispatched from the U.S. Pacific Fleet; one, a cruiser, will be stationed in Seoul harbor, and the other, a destroyer, will be stationed in Busan. A radio station controlled by the North Korean Communist Party has demanded that all left-wing elements fight against the "general election" until "death." U.S. authorities have expressed fear that a riot may be brewing. To prevent serious incidents during the election, U.S. occupation officials are establishing their own power plants to supply electricity to South Korea.

### Czechoslovak Representative Declares Refusal to Attend the Security Council

[United Press, Lake Success, 10th] Czechoslovakia has refused the Security Council's request for it to attend the Council's debate on the Czechoslovakian situation and to answer questions about the Communist Party's seizure of power in that country. The new Czechoslovakian representative, Hodanok, wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Lai Yi that Chile's accusation clearly violates the UN charter clause "prohibiting interference in internal affairs."

### Martial Law Declared in Northern Iran, Large Numbers of Communists Arrested, Conspiracy to Stage Coup in Early May Discovered

[Reuters, Tehran, 10th] The Iranian government today suddenly took security measures, arresting nearly 300 communists in the northern province of Mazandaran and declaring martial law in three cities in the area. An army spokesman confirmed the arrests and the declaration of martial law but declined to say whether all those arrested were members of the Tudeh Party (Communist Party) or to reveal the exact number of those arrested. The governor of Isfahan province in the south, Bakhtiar, was also among those arrested, indicating the seriousness of the situation in Iran.

Bakhtiar, leading his guards, resisted arrest for a week and finally surrendered on Thursday. Police arrested former army captain Rousbeh, who had fled to the Soviet Union after participating in the failed autonomous government of Azerbaijan, in Simrun, a suburb of Tehran, yesterday. It is rumored that the governor of Isfahan has connections with the Soviet Union. According to right-wing newspapers, the Communist Party had a plan to stage an uprising in Iran in early May, with participants being former members of the previous Azerbaijan autonomy movement and some new recruits. Some pro-Soviet figures disappeared after the failure of the Azerbaijan movement, having actually fled to the Soviet Union to prepare for a resurgence. It is said that the location for this uprising is the Gorgan Plain on the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea in Mazandaran Province, and that Mazandaran, Isfahan, and some indigenous areas in southern and central Iran are strategic areas for the Communist coup. Tudeh Party members are particularly active in Isfahan Province, actively engaging in inciting the masses, while the Soviet Union is also utilizing the Basseri tribe of the Qashqai people. Many of these tribes have secretly entered Iran from the Soviet Union to plot an uprising. The newspaper summarized the Communist-directed "Plan 1327" (this year is 1227 in the Iranian calendar), saying that its steps involve intensifying propaganda, coupled with repeated Soviet protests to Iran as a form of coercion, while simultaneously sending more agents into Iran to incite the indigenous people to rebel against the government, and then staging uprisings simultaneously across the country on the predetermined date. The newspaper said that this information was revealed by people close to the government.

### Chardonne Replaces Jodru as French Ambassador to the Soviet Union

[Reuters, London, 10th] Moscow Radio reported that the outgoing French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, General Jodru, departed from Moscow for France on the 9th. The French government's foreign policy advisor, the former Governor-General of Algeria, Chardonne, will succeed him.

### New Siamese Prime Minister Luang Phibuns Expresses Goodwill Towards China, Says He Will Resolve the Problem of Chinese in Siam

Reuters, Bangkok, 10th] The new Siamese Prime Minister, Field Marshal Luang Phibunsongkhram, expressed concern at a press conference today about possible incidents between China and Siam. However, he said that the Siamese government is studying the immigration laws of other countries and other laws to resolve the issue of Chinese in Siam. Mr. Pibun also revealed that his new cabinet of twenty-five people is almost complete and hopes that all countries in the world will recognize his government. Regarding the organization of the new cabinet, retired foreign affairs elder Prince Phiriabhiban has agreed to serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and he expects the parliament to give the cabinet a vote of confidence. Speaking of Sino-Siamese relations, he said that one thing in the current situation that concerns him is the possibility of incidents occurring between China and Siam. He said that even a slight mistake by the government could trigger unrest, as the Chinese were once very unfavorable towards him. However, the Siamese government certainly does not intend to infringe on the rights of the Chinese in Siam. The government is now studying the laws of other countries regarding immigration and other matters to resolve the problem of Chinese in Siam.

(16) Defending Hengyang Greatly Frustrated the Japanese Invaders

In the war against Japan, the Americans responsible for military supplies to China used most of the supplies to reopen Burma, and by the time the situation in China became critical in 1944, their help was too little and too late.

One of the Japanese goals in 1944 was to open an inland transportation line from Manchuria through China to Southeast Asia, a goal that was eventually achieved. The record of Japanese success is also a record of American warnings unheeded and requests unfulfilled. In May, the situation in China had deteriorated to such an extent that without using the fuel flown over the Hump to supply the B-29s based near Chengdu for future operations—and without using the Superfortresses to strike at the Japanese offensive bases on the south bank of the Yangtze River, Hankou—there was simply no chance of stopping the Japanese offensive.

In accordance with the instructions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Theater Commander Stilwell had the authority to declare a state of emergency and to make emergency use of the 20th Bomber Group and other resources of the Theater Command. In mid-May, I telegraphed Stilwell that a state of emergency was imminent.

I suggested that he set a limit for declaring a state of emergency, so that there would be some time for planning beforehand. He replied to this with an insinuation, saying that this would make the Chinese completely dependent on us. He was not prepared to declare a state of emergency until the crisis became "absolutely certain." This telegram was sent on May 25, 1944, just one day before the Japanese launched their offensive from the south bank of the Yangtze River in Hunan Province. One day before the offensive.

I had no choice but to use the full strength of the 14th Air Force and the Sino-American Composite Wing to launch attacks, while reiterating warnings of impending disaster and reiterating requests for more supplies, so that these few aircraft could continue to fight. My warnings and requests did not produce concrete results. It was not until mid-June that the Theater Command had to admit that disaster was imminent. In the second half of April and the first half of May, Henan Province on the north bank of the Yangtze River had been breached by the Japanese, as a prelude to the offensive in Hunan Province on the south bank of the Yangtze River. On June 5, Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, was attacked by the Japanese and fell two weeks later. Changsha was where the previous, weaker Japanese offensive had been blocked. There was no way to stop the Japanese in Henan, but in Hunan it was different. In Hunan, we had strong air force units that could support the Chinese army. With just a small amount of weapons and supplies, the Chinese army could perform very well. This was especially true for Xue Yue's troops stationed from Changsha south to Hengyang. I believed that just increasing the air force's supplies by 2,000 tons per month in April and May could have reversed the situation on the south bank of the Yangtze River. This amount was only slightly more than the air supplies we lost due to the launch of the Nujiang-Burma operation.

Most of the Japanese troops used in the Hunan area were first transferred to the Yangtze River area, and then launched an offensive southward from the Hankou area. Hankou was their main base, and the Yangtze River was their supply line, both of which were easily vulnerable to air attacks. If 2,000 tons of fuel and ammunition could have been used for air attacks in April and May, the enemy's strength could have been weakened, its steps disrupted, and its morale dampened at the beginning of the offensive, which would have greatly benefited the poorly armed Chinese army.

The fact that Xue Yue's troops defended Hengyang for forty-seven days supports this belief. However, the Theater Command regarded Hengyang as already lost when the Japanese launched their first attack, and indeed viewed the battles in eastern China with careless defeatism.

When the Japanese artillery began targeting Changsha on June 5, Stilwell left Burma to personally pay attention to the situation in China. Stilwell had been staying in Burma for several months in order to open up the Burma Road. When he arrived in Kunming, he avoided holding a meeting with me and immediately flew to Chongqing to meet with Chairman Chiang.

In Chongqing, Stilwell finally agreed to increase the 14th Air Force's supplies to the level I had recommended. He told me of this decision during a brief stopover in Kunming on his way back to Burma. His stopover was so short that we were unable to consider the equally important issue of how to transport the supplies eastward along the dilapidated transportation lines to our air force bases.

### Liberal and Conservative Parties Agree to Cooperate, New Government Established in Colombia, Beles Reelected President, Order Restored in Colombian Capital

[United Press, Bogotá, Colombia, 11th] A united government has been established in Colombia today in an attempt to stop the 24-hour revolutionary riots.

### Dance Industry's Appeal Rejected, Full Text of the City Government's Decision, Appellant's Failure to Perform Duties is Irredeemable

[This newspaper] In the case of the dance industry workers petitioning and vandalizing the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Bureau of Social Affairs ordered the dissolution of the Dance Hall Business Association, the Vocational Union, and the Professional Musicians Association in accordance with Article 18, Paragraph 1, Item 4 of the People's Organization Law during Extraordinary Times. The Dance Hall Business Association expressed disagreement with the Bureau of Social Affairs' decision and, through lawyer Chen Rui, filed an administrative appeal with the City Government. The City Government ruled that the reasons were insufficient and rejected the appeal. The decision has already been delivered to the Bureau of Social Affairs.

Main Text

"If the Dance Hall Business Association does not agree with this decision, it may file a further appeal with the Ministry of Social Affairs within 30 days from the day of delivery." The reasons for the ruling are as follows:

Reasons

"According to Article 18, Paragraph 1 of the People's Organization Law during Extraordinary Times, when a people's organization violates laws and regulations, endangers public interests, or neglects its duties, the competent authority may take the following actions: (1) Warning. (2) Revocation of registration. (3) Reorganization. (4) Dissolution. Therefore, what should be investigated in this case is whether the appellant has violated laws and regulations, endangered public interests, or neglected its duties. It has been found that the meeting minutes of the appellant association on January 24 of this year record that 25 dance hall representatives, including Sun Hongyuan, and 34 employee, dancer, and musician representatives were present. Chairman Sun Hongyuan reported that the extension of the lottery was difficult to approve. The issue of banning the dance lottery is very urgent, and it is requested that everyone discuss it together. It was decided that the third plenary session of all colleagues would be held at New Xianlin Dance Hall at 9:00 a.m. on January 31. Also, the meeting minutes of the appellant association on January 29 record that 21 dance hall representatives, including Sun Hongyuan, and 25 employee, dancer, employee, and musician representatives were present. Item 4 of the discussion items was a proposal to petition the Bureau of Social Affairs after the general meeting on the 31st. It was decided that everyone would go together, and dancers would be transported by truck. Item 7 was a proposal on whether to punish those who did not attend the general meeting and petition on the 31st. It was decided that all employees who did not attend would be suspended, and dancers who did not attend would be fined 2 million to 3 million yuan. Also, the eighth proposal of the third temporary emergency meeting of colleagues on January 31 was that all employees and dancers unanimously requested the congress to petition the Bureau of Social Affairs. It was decided that everyone would unanimously pass the motion. All of the above meeting situations and resolutions are supported by the records at the time and can be used as evidence. Looking at the above records in comparison with each other, it is sufficient to prove that the collective petition on January 31 was purely initiated by the appellant, which is very clear. The resolutions to prepare special vehicles to transport dancers to the Bureau of Social Affairs and to suspend or fine 2 million to 3 million yuan to those who do not go to the Bureau of Social Affairs are intended to intentionally use violence, coercion, and instigation to cause trouble, which cannot be denied. Article 2 of the Temporary Measures for Maintaining Social Order, promulgated by the National Government on May 18 of last year, states: All people's organizations or school students may send representatives to express their opinions, but the number of representatives is limited to ten people, and they may not use coercion by gathering crowds. Those who violate this will be dissolved in accordance with Article 149 of the law. This law should be known to the appellant. However, they have repeatedly made the aforementioned decisive battle, which is legally inappropriate. Moreover, according to the investigation, when the appellant instigated the petition to reach the original office, they did not follow the regulations to send representatives to the original office to express their opinions. They immediately carried out a riot, vandalized public property, and obstructed public affairs, which is even more illegal. Even if the initial purpose of the appellant's instigation of the petition was not to carry out a riot, instigating thousands upon thousands of people to collectively petition may allow any unfortunate incident to occur. Since the appellant's responsibility is to prevent this from happening, but they were unable to do so in advance. When the riot occurred, they were unable to provide effective dissuasion in time, which shows that the organization was loose, the leadership was lacking, and the failure to perform duties is irredeemable. Therefore, the appellant in this case violated laws and regulations by instigating a collective petition, and then failed to lead properly, causing a riot and affecting social security. The nature of the situation is obviously not comparable to ordinary incidents. Therefore, the original office dissolved the organization and sent personnel to reorganize it. Based on the above discussion and conclusion, the appeal in this case should be considered unreasonable. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of the first section of Article 8 of the Administrative Appeal Law, the decision is made as stated in the main text."

### Tragic Incident on Beijing West Road: Rickshaw Overturns, Woman in Green Crushed to Death

A Business Card with the Name Ding Menghen Found in Her Pocket; Rickshaw Puller and Tram Driver Flee, Fearing Punishment

[Report from Our Newspaper] At approximately 8:30 PM last night, a rickshaw carrying a young woman holding a child was passing by the opposite side of the Taifu Garden on Beijing West Road when a No. XX trolleybus came speeding up from behind. The rickshaw puller, fearing a collision, suddenly braked. Unexpectedly, the rickshaw was violently shaken and overturned to the left. The woman fell to the ground with the rickshaw and was run over in the head by the rear wheel of the trolleybus. Her brains splattered, and she died instantly at the scene. Fortunately, the child was unharmed. After the accident, both the rickshaw puller and the trolleybus driver fled the scene. Subsequently, the nearby police officers arrived and immediately called for an ambulance to transport the body to the Red Cross Hospital for transfer to the coroner's office for examination. Upon receiving the report, the Jing'an Temple Police Precinct dispatched officers to investigate the truth and to seek out the deceased's family members, while also issuing an arrest warrant for the fugitives.

Further investigation revealed that the deceased was approximately 22-23 years old, wearing a dark green padded overcoat, light gray knitted socks, and white cloth shoes. She had a gold ring with several small diamonds on the middle finger of her right hand. A business card was found on her, bearing the name Ding Mengzhen, also known as Yizhou, apparently an introduction to a doctor for medical consultation. The child she was holding was about one year old.

### Workers' Education Investigation Committee's Work in Progress; Believes China Textile's Various Facilities Are Worth Learning From

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Workers' Education Investigation Committee of the Teachers College of National Central University, led by the director, has recently launched a comprehensive investigation of the various factories in Shanghai affiliated with the China Textile Construction Company. On the morning of April 5th, the first discussion meeting of the investigators was held at the China Textile General Company. At that time, based on the scope of the investigation, it was decided to proceed in three groups: one group for the education of employees' children, one group for general training, and one group for technical training. Since the afternoon of April 5th, the various members and investigators have been following the scheduled agenda, departing collectively for visits every day while also conducting separate investigations in groups and implementing individual interviews. During the first week of investigation, until the afternoon of the 9th, they visited more than twenty units, including the technical training classes, research classes, workers' supplementary classes, children's primary schools, hospitals, and employee welfare facilities affiliated with the various China Textile factories. At each unit, a discussion meeting was first held with the responsible personnel to conduct a detailed review of the entire facility, and then an on-site visit and investigation was conducted, filling out detailed forms. Opinion surveys for students in specialized research classes, technical training classes, and training classes were filled out separately by the students due to their higher level of education. As for the individual worker survey form, the listed survey items, ranging from gender, place of origin, and age to family economic status, social life and psychological status, beliefs, hobbies, and aspirations, numbered as many as eighty-two items. The investigation method was for the investigators to record the answers based on the questions asked item by item. Each interview with a worker required at least one hour.

On the afternoon of the 9th, the Investigation Committee held its first work review meeting. In addition to reviewing the work of the past week, it was also decided to conduct rigorous investigations and facility unit investigations in groups starting this week. The investigation work is expected to be completed by April 20th. From April 21st to May 31st, the data will be sorted, compiled, and reports will be written, with Zhao Mian and Yi Qichang serving as the chief and deputy editors, respectively. At the first work review meeting, after careful study, Chairman Zhao officially announced to reporters that there were three points: (1) Technical Education: China Textile has a method of training apprentice workers for raw workers. For the cultivation of lower-level basic cadres, there are artisan training classes. For the cultivation of middle and lower-level technicians, there are technical training classes. For the advanced studies of on-the-job personnel, there are advanced study classes. For the improvement of factory technology, there are specialized technical research classes. These facilities demonstrate China Textile's emphasis on worker technical training classes. Moreover, its training spirit is quite conducive to the mutual coordination of technical training and actual production processes. The intention is very good and worth learning from. (2) General Education: Most factories have established worker supplementary classes, and their importance has been recognized by the responsible persons of each factory. However, workers are physically and mentally exhausted after working ten hours a day, and enrollment is not very enthusiastic, so the results are not significant. The way to improve is to pay attention to all aspects of teaching materials, teaching methods, teachers, and working hour systems at the same time. Movie, broadcasting, and other non-formal education facilities should also be fully utilized. (3) Employee Welfare: In employee welfare undertakings, medical facilities and employee children's schools are of considerable scale.

### Paint Merchant Xi Rungeng Accused of Abandoning His Illegitimate Children; Legal Wife Missing, Life or Death Unknown; Request to Acknowledge Biological Children; Blood Type Test Does Not Conform to Genetic Statistical Formula

[Report from Our Newspaper] Xi Rungeng, the owner of the Grand Shanghai Hotel and Ruirun Paint Company, has recently been sued in court by a Ningbo woman, Hua Wangshi, for abandoning his illegitimate children. Mediation failed, and she requested a legal judgment. The object of the lawsuit is to request a judgment acknowledging Xi Baxin and Xi Xiaomei as the biological children of the defendant Xi Rungeng and the plaintiff. The defendant should acknowledge Baxin and Xiaomei as his biological children, and the defendant should bear the litigation costs.

The facts and reasons stated in the complaint are as follows: In June 1930, the defendant in this case used various methods and means to establish a marital relationship with the plaintiff. In the spring of the following year, the defendant rented a room on the front floor of No. 32, Shoufu Lane in this city as a place for secret rendezvous and cohabitation. In September 1932, she became pregnant. At that time, the plaintiff's husband, Hua Xianping, was working in Jinhua. On the 13th day of the fifth lunar month of 1933, she gave birth to a son. Because the defendant loved the drama "Farewell My Concubine," he named him "Baxin." Later, they moved to No. 35 in the same lane, and their relationship deepened. In September 1936, she became pregnant again. At that time, the plaintiff's husband was working in Haimen. On the 19th day of the sixth lunar month of 1937, she gave birth to a daughter, who was also named "Xiaomei" by the defendant.

Repeatedly Asked the Defendant About Her Husband

At that time, the war situation was becoming increasingly urgent. The plaintiff's husband resigned from his job in Haimen and returned home. Fortunately, both matters were cleverly concealed. The defendant and the plaintiff's husband were originally friends, but it was always inconvenient for him to live in the house. The defendant strongly urged Xianping to go to Shantou to take over the business of the Hongmao Soap Factory on his behalf. The plaintiff and Xianping did not know it was a trap and resolutely went on the trip. The defendant sent people with the surname Fang to follow. Unexpectedly, he never returned. The plaintiff became suspicious and repeatedly asked about him. Later, she heard the defendant say vaguely, "I'm afraid he's already dead in Hong Kong." The plaintiff was a weak woman with no way out. After Xianping left home, the defendant openly came and went to the plaintiff's house, and ordered Baxin to call him father. The defendant also supplied all living expenses.

Same Voice and Appearance

At that time, the defendant's wife had died, and he asked the plaintiff to move into his house to formalize their relationship. The plaintiff became even more suspicious, deeply suspecting that Xianping had been harmed by the defendant's premeditation. The defendant, seeing that the plaintiff's questioning was becoming increasingly urgent, stopped coming in 1941 and abandoned his children. Later, he colluded with the old patrol room to fabricate threatening letters in an attempt to frame the plaintiff and silence her. The lawsuit has been going on for six years without any results. The plaintiff's husband has not returned home to this day. She had previously filed a lawsuit for confirmation, which was rejected for "lack of standing." According to the case, the parties with a clear stake are the biological children of the defendant and the plaintiff. Their voices and appearances are exactly the same. How can the defendant abandon them? In addition to filing a separate lawsuit regarding the unknown whereabouts of the plaintiff's husband, she specially states the above true facts and requests a legal judgment.

Denial During the Hearing

However, the conclusion obtained from the blood type test conducted by the Institute of Forensic Medicine was that Xi Rungeng and Hua Wangshi were both blood type O, while Baxin and Xiaomei were both blood type A. According to the statistical formula of blood type inheritance, the blood type A of Baxin and Xiaomei should not have been produced by the combination of two blood type O's.

The court previously held a hearing once. The plaintiff Hua Wangshi testified that Xi abandoned her and had a conspiracy to harm her husband. Xi testified that he was being falsely accused and firmly denied that he had a romantic relationship with Hua Wangshi.

### Yan Pei and Attorney Treat Reporters, Presenting Two New Pieces of Evidence; If They Want a Reconciliation, They Must First Recover the Lost Items; The Court Will Summon Yan for Questioning This Morning

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yan Peiyu, the protagonist of the "Mystery of the Madman" case, once again hosted reporters at the Wuxi Fellow Association at 4:00 PM yesterday. Yan's spirit was better than at the previous press conference. He spoke clearly and logically when he stood up to report. He first retold the past entanglements with his wife and the experience of being sent to a mental hospital. He also presented two new pieces of evidence in his report: first, when going to the hospital, they rode in two cars, one was a business car from Xiang Sheng Company, and the other was a private business car, the last three digits of the license plate number were "616." Second, someone in Puji Hospital clearly said to him: The reason he was sent to the hospital was because someone instigated it. Regarding the situation of filing a lawsuit after being discharged from the hospital, he said that he has requested the police bureau to investigate thoroughly. The police bureau has summoned him for questioning seven times. Chief Sun of the Criminal Division once advised him to reconcile, but he felt that his wife's methods were vicious. Even during the confrontation at the police bureau recently, she still said that he had mental illness, that he could not handle the factory affairs, and that it was originally very good to invite Hou Jiyuan to be the manager of the factory. He felt that his wife had no conscience at all, so he was unwilling to reconcile casually. If they want to reconcile, the first thing to do is to recover the lost items. However, when both parties, along with lawyers and police bureau personnel, went to the factories to take over the goods the other day, the inventory showed that thirty to forty boxes of metal parts were missing. Later, after Yan locked the factory doors, his wife sent someone to cut off the chains. The workers Yan sent to guard the factory were driven away, and the notices he posted were torn down. Yesterday, Hou Jiyuan sent someone with the surname Song, named Zhao Jinwei, to visit the Daxi Road branch factory, so the civil part has not yet been resolved, and the criminal part requests the police bureau to step up the investigation. Finally, Yan said again: "Please take a look, I really don't have any mental illness!"

At 10:00 AM this morning, the local court will hold a hearing in Court No. 11 to summon Yan Peiyu for questioning in order to decide on the issue of prohibiting the management of property applied for by his wife Yuan Baoying.

### The Film Industry in Difficult Circumstances: Difficulty in Funds, Difficulty in Talent, Even More Difficulty in Talent; No Wonder Western Films Fill the Market

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] After the victory, several film companies held many temporary actor examinations. The many applicants, who were crowded together, said in unison that they had a special love for film art. Later, after careful research by the companies, they found that the so-called "love for film art" was completely a euphemism. In fact, they just wanted to be "stars" and enjoy the silent envy of thousands of audiences for them. However, these ambitious people were unfortunately disappointed. In the past two or three years, it has been difficult to see a few unfamiliar faces on the screen. Even if a few "guest stars" appear, such as Xie Jiahua, Yuan Xuefen, Yi Xueyan, Hua Xianglin, etc., it is because they have titles such as "Miss" and "Queen," or even because the filming is "self-funded." Currently, most of the distribution income of film companies depends on Southeast Asia. To date, the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are enthusiastically fascinated by the voices and smiles of a few old movie stars, and at the same time, they are also longing for the manners and movements of the domestically renowned "socialites." Their leap to the screen is of course a timely event. If a newcomer relies solely on a little acting skill, trying to show courtesy to the Southeast Asian audience on the screen, the result will definitely not be too ideal. Now the cost of a film is at least tens of billions or more. Film companies cannot make such a risky investment for the promotion of a few newcomers.

Star Life is Not Necessarily Comfortable

In fact, even if you really become a "star," life may not be as rich and comfortable as most people imagine. The film industry currently has no one to provide loans. The Shanghai foreign-owned cinemas are unwilling to regularly show domestic films. Although domestic films sell very well in many small cities outside of Shanghai, the ticket prices are extremely low. Selling films produced at high prices to rural and urban areas with low prices, the total income is of course limited. Now, except for a few glittering red stars, the lives of the entire film industry staff are very poor. The base salary is still stagnant below 65 yuan. The suffering of the times imposed on the shoulders of the film industry is no different from what we have experienced. Employees cannot study and improve. It is naturally even more difficult for film art to reach international standards. There are also recent

Impact on Psychological Restraints

In recent years, the storms caused by domestic films in society have also dealt a lot of blows to the film industry. The air force in "Su Fengji," the doctor in "A Spring River Flows East," the barber in "Fake Phoenixes," and the driver in "Where is the Jade Beauty" have all caused great resentment in these occupational classes. The formation of this resentment, on the one hand, affects the psychological constraints of the screenwriters. On the other hand, it makes the people who manage film censorship unwilling to let go of any film easily. For example, they require domestic films to have a sense of cause and effect. Bad people must immediately be tried in court and spend their years in prison, unlike American films. After a murderer commits a crime, he disappears without a trace, and as a result, he is murdered by his mistress years later, or is killed in a drunken fight. Since bad people do evil, they should no longer have wealth or love affairs, and they should only eat fists and be struck by the wind even when fighting. They also require domestic films to not insult all occupations and religions. People who begin to betray religion and eventually convert to religion, or those who are sheltered by religion and do evil, like in the American films "The Gunfighter" and "How Green Was My Valley," cannot appear.

Simple Equipment is Difficult to Improve

It is still possible to write all the characters as harmonious and kind, and to write all the things as satisfactory, but the low quality of photographic equipment is really impossible to improve. Replenishment requires money, and purchasing from abroad requires foreign exchange. Now the lighting equipment of each company is simple, the film is too slow to sense light, and the facial makeup of the crew is often fully revealed, making the audience look no different from Peking opera. Hollywood old stars Claudette Colbert, Ann Sheridan, and others are still in their youthful years in the lens, deceiving the audience and fascinating the audience for decades. This is absolutely dare not to be expected in domestic films. According to people in the film industry, even if Huang Zongzhan returns to Shanghai and intends to show his skills in his motherland, but in front of this pile of "cameras," he will definitely have a feeling of being unable to use his skills.

These are enough to explain why even the lowest-grade and most boring Western films can sell well in the country.

### Shanghai Air Defense Command is Currently Being Organized

Xuan Tiewu Expresses His General Resignation as Commander

Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu told a Central News Agency reporter yesterday: He has resigned twice to the central government from concurrently serving as the Shanghai Air Defense Commander, and it is still under consideration. He believes that it is more appropriate for the current Air Force general to take up this position. He served as the Air Defense Commander of Zhejiang Province during the Anti-Japanese War, and he knows the burden of this position. Now the affairs of the garrison commander are already extremely busy, so he is afraid that it will be difficult to take care of both. He talked about air defense, saying that air defense is not because there is war, but a necessary equipment for modern national defense, which can be regarded as a type of national defense business. However, active air defense should be more important than passive defense. Active air defense is to enrich the strength of the air force. As for the Shanghai Air Defense Command, it is being organized, and the address has not yet been determined.

### Careless Hunting Causes Injury

[Report from Our Newspaper] A villager named Qian Fuqi, forty years old, lives in Gaomiao Tashi Bridge, Pudong. At about 5:00 PM yesterday, a hunter suddenly shot at a flying bird from a distance. Unexpectedly, the bullet hit Qian's lungs, and he fell to the ground. Nearby villagers arrived, detained the hunter, and sent him to the Yangjing Police Station for investigation. The injured person was sent to Gongji Hospital for treatment.

### Encouraging Donations with Visual Impact: A Parade of Refugee Children

Children Sitting in Cars and Living in Foreign-Style Houses: "Mayor Cai" Neither Envies Nor Hates Them

In response to the United Nations Children's Relief Fund's fundraising campaign, the Caohejing Municipal Refugee Children's Education Center specially held a grand parade yesterday. According to the team leader, Zhang Jingyan, 430 refugee children participated in the parade. In the morning, they took a bus to the Social Bureau, and from there, they proceeded to the Great World, turned to Nanjing Road and the Bund, and then took a short rest in the Bund Garden. The reporter, introduced by the team leader Zhang Jingyan, interviewed Cai Zhongde, the "Mayor of Shanghai" of the suffering children. An excerpt of the conversation is as follows: Asked, "Mayor Cai, what are your thoughts on the children begging on the streets?" He replied, "Yes, I dare to represent all the citizens of Shanghai (referring to the refugee children) and say that we really want to help the children who are begging, but we don't have the strength because we are still being helped by others." Asked, "Mayor, are you envious when you see children sitting in cars, living in foreign-style houses, and wearing beautiful clothes?" He replied, "I neither envy nor hate them, but it is indeed wrong for such a thing (referring to rich and poor children) to exist in a country. They are all children, so why do some enjoy too much and some enjoy too little?" The conversation ended, and when the team was returning, Mayor Cai led the team, followed by a decorated car with three-dimensional figures representing the contrasting lives of poor and rich children, including a boy with "tattered clothes and a dirty face" and a girl with clear eyes and delicate features, standing there, giving a deeper performance.

### The School Term Case Will Continue Hearing This Morning: Mobilization and Alertness

[Our Newspaper] The case of the Tongji University student unrest injuring Mayor Wu will continue its hearing at the District Court Criminal Division at 8:30 this morning. Judge Hu Zhichao will continue to preside over the hearing. Hearing permits have already been issued, and those without hearing permits will not be allowed to enter. To prevent incidents from occurring, a large number of police officers and court police officers will be dispatched this morning to arrange security.

### Weather Forecast

Shanghai: Sunny, cold, turning slightly warmer, haze, moderate northeast to southeast wind, haze and light fog in the evening and morning.

Temperature for the 11th: Minimum 8.2 degrees Celsius (46.7 degrees Fahrenheit), maximum 13.9 degrees Celsius (57.0 degrees Fahrenheit).

### Fluorescent Light Users: Limited Installation of Capacitors

[Our Newspaper] In order to conserve electricity, the Public Utilities Bureau previously ordered all fluorescent light users in the city to install capacitors. However, most users have not yet complied. In addition to sending letters to fluorescent light users, the power companies have also sent personnel to start inspecting various locations and request that they install them within a specified period. If they continue to ignore the request, they will be warned and given 50 days to complete the installation, otherwise they will be prohibited from using fluorescent lights. It is reported that fluorescent lights can save about 30% of electricity after installing capacitors.

### General Commodity Prices: Monetary Conditions Transition to a Period of Relaxation, Price Increase Trend Is Stirred Up Again

In the previous issue, this publication pointed out that according to the inevitable law of alternating price increases and decreases and alternating monetary tightening and loosening in the late stage of inflation, monetary conditions entered a period of relaxation again last week. The actual performance was not far from the theoretical prediction. The relaxation of monetary conditions last week was an unprecedented phenomenon in a month. Continuing the loose trend of the previous weekend, it was still exceptionally loose and excessive. The black market interest rate dropped by another 0.1 from the previous weekend, amounting to 0.26, and the banks generally had more funds than they needed, even suffering from the difficulty of lending out money. The impact of such loose monetary conditions on commodity prices is self-evident. However, there were three relatively special factors in the resurgence of commodity price increases last week, which were not present in the previous few weeks. The impact of these factors is not limited to last week but will continue to have a profound impact in the coming week, which is worth noting. Many merchants in the market even psychologically believe that the second major price fluctuation of this year will start from last week. Although this is the merchants' view and has no theoretical basis, it is not difficult to imagine the impact on commodity prices if the majority of merchants in the market are bullish on prices. In addition to the loose monetary conditions, the other three special factors for the rebound in commodity prices last week are:

First, the order to suspend deferred settlement transactions of securities was issued by the Executive Yuan to the Ministry of Finance and Economics on the previous Saturday. The resident securities exchange supervision office of the Ministry of Finance and Economics received the order on the previous Sunday and immediately notified the securities exchange authorities, which complied. Although this measure is justified in cracking down on speculative transactions from the government's perspective, it has a significant impact on commodity prices from the perspective of its relationship to commodity prices. On the one hand, the arbitrage funds in each deferred settlement have now reached more than 1 trillion. After the suspension of deferred settlement activities, will these funds not become floating capital in society again? On the other hand, the deferred settlement margin and additional margin deposited in the National Bank are also very large. After the cancellation of deferred settlement, this amount of funds will flow out of the National Bank, will the source of floating capital in society not increase again? At least some of these floating funds will enter the path of absorbing materials. Second, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee raised various foreign exchange rates by about 25% again last Tuesday. The benchmark price of US dollars rose to 324,000 yuan, an increase of 69,000 yuan; the British pound rose to 972,000 yuan, an increase of 207,000 yuan; the Hong Kong dollar and Indian rupee also increased. The impact is of course obvious. The stock market immediately rebounded that day, with as many as 13 spot stocks reaching the limit up. Foreign stocks also tended to be strong, with Jardine Matheson surging past the 5 million mark. The cotton cloth market was also affected, and the market sentiment was revived. Spot stocks reappeared across the board on Wednesday, and foreign stocks rose by 20%. The cotton cloth market's upward trend intensified. These are all immediate effects of the foreign exchange increase, but its impact is not limited to last week. In addition, the impact on the black market for gold and banknotes is self-evident. The telegraphic transfer rate for Hong Kong dollars shrank to 8.5 cents per 100,000 legal currency on Thursday, which is a record high. Of course, this is also inevitably affected by the increase in the foreign exchange benchmark rate. Third, the prices of four public utilities in the city, including telephone, electricity, and tap water, increased uniformly last Friday, all by 60% to 70%, which is the highest percentage increase in previous times. The impact of this increase is of course also not limited to last week.

Under the influence of the above factors, commodity prices rose quite a lot last week, especially in the second half of the week (but please note that the various commodity price indices compiled by this association are limited to the materials from Monday to Thursday, which is entirely due to publication time constraints). In particular, building materials, cotton textiles, and food rose more sharply. The cotton cloth market reached new highs last Thursday. 42-count Blue Phoenix reached 240 million per piece, 21-count Double Horse reached 160 million, and 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth exceeded the 5 million mark. These are all new records that have never been seen before. Although there was a slight decline at the weekend, various cotton textiles were still more than 10% higher than the previous weekend. Silk fabrics rose less. The food market was affected by the increase in the city government's rationed food prices, and because of rumors at the beginning of last week that the People's Food Allocation Committee was considering purchasing food rice due to the sluggish food market, although the committee denied it, the market had already been affected. Superior white japonica rice reached a high price of 4 million per picul again last Friday, and extra-high japonica rice once reached a maximum of 4.15 million. Military vessel wheat flour also approached the peak of 1.5 million per bag again, and other edible oils and miscellaneous grains also rose at the same time. The rise in wood and bricks among building materials was even faster. Chemicals, metals, etc., were relatively stable, such as 693 vulcanized metal, which only increased by 2 million from 50 million per barrel at the end of the previous weekend to the end of last week. But what is worrying is that the impact of foreign exchange adjustments and public utility price increases will continue to appear in the next few weeks, and if the government has no new outlets to divert the funds absorbed by deferred settlements after the suspension of deferred settlements, there will be another source of floating capital in the market. Perhaps the monetary authorities already have a plan in mind.

In addition, there are various rumors in the market, such as the foreign exchange market will be reopened, import and export trade will be allowed to implement a partial linked system, and the foreign exchange benchmark rate will be adjusted again, all of which stimulate price increases. How to quell these rumors is naturally also a major goal of stabilizing commodity prices.

### Currency and Finance: Excess Liquidity and Loose Monetary Conditions, Ample Funds and Lower Black Market Interest Rates

Last week, the city's monetary conditions were fully relaxed to the point of being excessive. Since the weekend before last, the National Bank continued to issue large amounts of new currency to cope with the exchange of short-term treasury bills and other payments, so the market was flooded with funds. Last week, the Executive Yuan ordered the suspension of deferred settlement transactions of Chinese stocks on Monday and set a deadline of seven days for final settlement. Although it was said that banks could subsequently hold weekly savings trust deposits with interest equal to interbank deposits of the National Bank to absorb the funds withdrawn from the arbitrage market due to the suspension of deferred settlement, because the interest on such trust deposits was not as high as the arbitrage interest, a portion of the funds, which may be quite large, may have become floating capital. The increasingly loose monetary conditions in the city after the second half of last week may be related to this. In addition, the continuous outflow of funds from national banks and the influx of floating capital from other places were also the main reasons for the overall loosening of monetary conditions last week.

Within five days from Monday to Friday last week, the exchange balance of national banks, except for a real net inflow of 34.9 billion on Thursday, was consistently a net outflow for the other days. After deducting the interbank time deposits of the National Bank, the actual net outflow of national banks reached more than 670 billion in four days.

On the commercial bank side, the general trend was long last week, and funds accumulated abnormally. Interbank lending was almost at a standstill. From Monday to Friday, the exchange results of banks after No. 60 showed a net outflow of 733.3 billion. Among them, the net inflow on Wednesday alone was 37.2 billion, which can also measure the abundance of bank reserves.

The exchange results of foreign banks last week showed a net inflow of 598.2 billion from Monday to Friday, including a net outflow of 19.1 billion on Wednesday. The net outflow of foreign banks is not common, and it is said to be related to the inflow of northern capital.

Another phenomenon of loose monetary conditions was the continued decline in black market interest rates. The black market interest rate in the first half of last week was generally between 0.27 and 0.24, and in the second half of the week, it was as low as 0.225 and 0.21, falling within the overdue interest parity of the banking industry. As for the interest on security firms' back-to-back transactions of white yarn, it was generally around 0.245 before Wednesday, but it rose to around 0.4 on Thursday, which was probably affected by the optimistic sentiment in the stock market.

Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates

Generally speaking, the domestic exchange rates of commercial banks in the city rose last week. The discount for Tianjin exchange was 50 yuan at the beginning of the week, and it rose to 30 yuan from Wednesday to Friday. The discount for Hankou exchange also continued to rise from 30 yuan on Monday to 100 yuan on Friday. The discount for Chongqing exchange also increased from 20 yuan to 30 yuan from Thursday to Friday. The discount for Xiamen exchange was 130 yuan at the beginning of the week, and it rose to 200 yuan on Friday. The discount for Guangzhou exchange generally hovered around 170 to 180 yuan throughout the week. The increase in exchange rates in various places shows the increasing outflow of funds from the city. The reason why Guangzhou exchange was relatively flat may be due to the impact of short-term treasury bills replacing exchange funds flowing south.

The benchmark rate for foreign exchange in the city was raised again on Tuesday, with the US dollar at 324,000 yuan per dollar, an increase of 27%. The exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar remained unchanged, equivalent to 972,000 yuan per British pound. The exchange rate for Hong Kong telegraphic transfers continued to tighten, and it entered the 1 yuan mark by Wednesday. It shrank again on Thursday, with 100,000 legal currency only worth 8.5 cents in Hong Kong dollars, which is related to the increase in the benchmark rate. The market price of US dollars in Hong Kong was around 5.723 Hong Kong dollars. The continuous decline in the Hong Kong exchange rate shows that capital flight is still severe.

Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

Last week, the Chinese stock market rose sharply and retreated quickly, and the volatility was quite drastic. On Monday, an order was issued to suspend deferred settlement transactions of Chinese stocks, stipulating that all new deferred settlement transactions would be suspended from April 5, and that any concluded transactions could only be completed within seven days. This was tantamount to blowing a storm in the stock market, causing the current 18 stocks to fall to the limit. The current month of Yongsha fell into the 1,400 mark. However, on Tuesday, stimulated by the favorable buy of the higher foreign exchange rate, major investors aggressively bought at low prices, and 14 current stocks recovered to the limit up, with ups and downs reaching almost 30%. On Wednesday, the Hong Kong exchange rate shrank to the 1 yuan mark, and monetary conditions were relaxed. The current 21 Chinese stocks reached the limit up. In the morning session on Thursday, Yongsha even knocked on the 2,000 yuan mark, but it rebounded slightly as major investors sold to cash in their profits. On Friday, loose monetary conditions remained, and the stock market rose by 10% as a result of the sudden 70% increase in public utility prices. If the closing price of Chinese stocks on Friday is compared with the holding price on Monday, Yongsha increased by 40%, Jinglun increased by 33%, and the increase rate of China Silk was more than 50%. The severity of this price increase was quite rare, and the strength of floating capital in the city can also be seen in general.

The fluctuations in foreign stocks were relatively small last week. The increase in foreign exchange rates, the overflow of monetary conditions, the shrinking of Hong Kong exchange rates, and the intended increase in public utility prices all provided incentives for favorable buying, so the market generally increased except for slight setbacks on Monday and Thursday. Compared with the afternoon buying price on Friday and Monday, Yisha increased by 37%, Jardine Matheson increased by about 30%, British American Tobacco increased by 26%, and Jardine Matheson increased by 25%. Generally speaking, the fluctuations were not as drastic as those of Chinese stocks.

### Industrial and Commercial Trends

The Problem of Freezing the Cost of Living Index

In the past week, due to the dispute over the monthly increase in the cost of living index, the opposing relationship between labor and management seems to have become more apparent. However, manufacturers are very clear in their hearts: First, the organized power of the working class makes it difficult to have a direct conflict with them. Second, in terms of the purchasing power of money, the cost of living index is only half of the general commodity price index. In the process of constantly rising commodity prices and constantly falling purchasing power of money, openly freezing the cost of living index is not only unbearable for the working class itself, which will incite a series of resistance such as strikes and work stoppages, but also unjust and not approved by social opinion in general. Therefore, the manufacturers' spearhead has to turn to the current government authorities, demanding that the government increase in-kind rations for workers to freeze the cost of living index in disguise.

However, due to the heavy burden of war expenses, the government has reduced the living standards of public servants to the lowest level. However, in today's situation where the cost of living index for public servants must be unfrozen, adding a not-so-small amount of in-kind rations for workers is indeed a very difficult problem to deal with. Although the problem is unexpectedly difficult, the government authorities must take steps to deal with this problem. Therefore, the Social Bureau has stated that all rations in factories must be handled through cooperatives in the future, and that once cooperatives are generally established in major factories throughout the city, the workers' rations will be expanded. At that time, the cost of living index will be calculated based on the price of rations. As the head of the cooperative section of the bureau explained, the active promotion of cooperative work throughout the city aims to reduce exploitation and profit-seeking by middlemen, and to achieve the practical effect of stabilizing commodity prices to achieve the goal of freezing the cost of living index in disguise.

According to another report, the plan prepared by the Social Bureau for providing rations to workers in general is as follows: (1) Raw material factories should supply finished product factories with rations at cost price; (2) For direct manufacturing factories, the government should provide part of the material rations to reduce manufacturing costs; (3) National banks should provide loans to finished product factories, and each factory should engage in large-scale production; (4) The ration method will still be handled in a cooperative manner in the future.

The first item in the above proposed plan is obviously unfavorable to raw material factories. Therefore, if there are other remedies, the situation of such factories will become more difficult. Items 2 and 3 are a disguised form of restoring industrial loans. After the restoration of industrial loans, assuming that other conditions remain unchanged, whether production can increase as scheduled to achieve the goal of stabilizing commodity prices remains to be proven by facts.

If the production volume does not increase as scheduled due to the supply of various favorable conditions, and if commodity prices fail to stabilize due to the continued deterioration of other factors (such as continued inflation) after the production volume increases, then the so-called cooperative handling of rations is nothing more than a disguised form of hoarding in advance. In this way, the stimulation of general commodity prices may be more drastic, and all adverse effects may not be deepened and widespread!

"Cheap Grain Harms Farmers" and "Expensive Grain Harms the People"?

Just when the majority of citizens were congratulating each other on the daily decline in the price of food rice, the listed prices in rice shops were rising daily. At the beginning of last week, people in the city's miscellaneous grain industry expressed their hope that the rice allocation authorities would pay attention to two things: (1) the storage problem of food rice. It is said that some of the food rice in the rice warehouses has become moldy, and the Huo Festival is approaching, which deserves special attention; (2) the price of rice in the rice-producing areas is higher than that in the city, which may cause the phenomenon of reverse flow of rice in the city. As for the government authorities, from a different perspective, they also expressed infinite worries about the daily decline in rice prices and sluggish sales! At the same time, for precautionary reasons, the People's Allocation Committee will plan to purchase rice arriving at the port (see the conversation of the head of the Grain Section of the Social Bureau). The planned method is that if any rice merchants have inventory that cannot be sold, the People's Allocation Committee will purchase it at the market transaction price, paying 80% of the price first, and the remaining 20% after delivery. At the same time, it is said that in order to stabilize rice prices in the city, the People's Allocation Committee specially transferred 90,000 dan of food rice purchased from Wuhu, Hankou and other places to the Nanjing Municipal Government. The head of the Grain Section of the Social Bureau believes that the measures taken by the People's Allocation Committee to purchase rice arriving at the port will not stimulate rice price increases, because it is said that in addition to providing grain according to the number of people every month, the People's Allocation Committee can also prepare to meet market needs at any time. Once rice prices rise, the People's Allocation Committee can sell the purchased food rice without restriction to regulate supply and demand. But the fact is exactly the opposite of what a certain section chief understands. The newspaper reported on the 8th that "the trend of rising food rice prices has expanded, because the People's Food Allocation Committee wants to set the market to collect rice, which has caused the rice market, which has just stabilized, to rise again and rekindle." The People's Allocation Committee, of course, cannot bear the responsibility for "expanding the trend of rising food rice prices." Therefore, the denial of the purchase of food rice reappeared in the newspaper on the 9th. At the same time, the reasons for the 15% increase in rice prices in the past three days were attributed to the high transportation costs and the stimulation of the increase in foreign exchange rates. However, in all fairness, the so-called no wind, no waves, the 15% increase in rice prices in the past three days is indeed related to the increase in foreign exchange rates, but it is also "coincidentally" related to the concerns of the relevant authorities about the daily decline in rice prices and the disclosure of the People's Allocation Committee's purchase plan and the transfer of 90,000 dan of food rice to the Beijing Municipal Government. The subtle relationship in between is self-evident to discerning people. "The purchase of food rice arriving at the port cannot stimulate rice price increases," so purchase it opportunistically in the "rice market that has just stabilized." If the rice market "rises again and rekindles" as a result, then "once rice prices rise, the People's Allocation Committee can sell the purchased food rice without restriction to regulate supply and demand." Buying in at low prices and selling at high prices, there is profit between one in and one out, and there is a theoretical basis for both. The theoretical basis for purchase is "cheap grain harms farmers," and the theoretical basis for sale is "expensive grain harms the people." But whether this theoretical basis can be established, it seems that the government authorities still need to consider it carefully.

### Industrial and Commercial Survey: Sino-Japanese Trade at the Current Stage

According to Tokyo news, the total amount of barter trade between China and Japan since the war has reached 40 million US dollars. Japanese exports of light bulbs and other goods are valued at 25 million US dollars, while our exports of ginseng and other goods to Japan are only 15 million US dollars of caustic soda, with a trade deficit of 10 million US dollars. According to customs statistics, the figures for last year were:

Item Quantity of Sino-Japanese Imports

Light Wood 210,602 cubic feet

Sleepers 414,748 pieces

Bicycles 2,653 units

Rayon 313,248 kilograms

Cigarette Paper 256,646 kilograms

Printing Paper 8,099 piculs

Light Bulbs 18,319 units

Ginseng 35,009 taels

Caustic Soda 466 piculs

Quantity of Chinese Exports to Japan

Salt 636,935 piculs

Refined Salt 100,000 piculs

Soybeans 29,000 piculs

Tung Oil 8,076 piculs

Soybean Cake 7,500 piculs

Sugar 1,129 piculs

All of the above barter transactions are managed by the Barter Division of the Central Trust Bureau. This year's barter materials to Japan will still be mainly salt, especially Weilu salt. It has now been decided to export 600,000 dan to Japan. Taiwan also has more than 20,000 tons of surplus salt waiting to be loaded onto ships. Last week, another 18,000 tons of soybeans from Northeast China were transported from Tianjin. Hankou transported 14,000 tons of soybean cake, peanuts and other miscellaneous grains. The first batch of 71,000 bags of Taiwan sugar, weighing 7,000 tons, also arrived in Japan the day before yesterday, which is the first batch of Taiwan sugar transported to Japan according to the contract. In addition, the export of 200,000 tons of ore sand from Hainan Island to Japan once made the Japanese rejoice. Recently, three Japanese engineers arrived in Hainan Island to survey. In addition to exchanging rayon and other materials, it is also planned to exchange for 120,000 spindles, because the Japanese cotton textile industry has great potential. Japan can currently manufacture 30,000 to 40,000 spindles per month, while China can only manufacture the same number in one year, and China still lacks a large-scale spindle manufacturing plant. Japan's production target for the cotton textile industry this year is 955,510,700 yards of cotton cloth, which will be dumped in large quantities in various parts of the Far East, including not only Nanyang and Korea, but also China itself. Looking at the situation of barter trade between China and Japan over the years, it still does not deviate from the scope of "industrial Japan and agricultural China." Looking to the future, it is truly alarming!

The students hoped to receive a subsidy of one million yuan per month for all meals, but the university did not agree.

A Repository of Knowledge about the "Sea": Maritime Academic Data Center in Xiamen

Our country's coastline stretches over 8,600 kilometers, from the mouth of the Yalu River in the north to the mouth of the Beilun River in the south. The "sea" is too closely connected to the lives of Chinese people, yet Chinese people's understanding of the "sea" is insufficient. May I ask how many institutions in China, which should be considered a maritime nation, are dedicated to studying the "sea"? We pay so little attention to the "sea."

Xiamen is a major port for overseas Chinese entering and leaving the country, and most of the people here rely on the sea for a living. They are thirsty for knowledge about the sea. In response to this need, a research institution dedicated to collecting data about the sea was established – the Maritime Academic Data Center. It was established just over a year ago, and its location is on the beautiful island of Gulangyu, in what was originally a villa owned by an overseas Chinese. It is surrounded by the sea on three sides, the buildings are high and airy, the scenery is beautiful, and the waves are vast. It is truly a scenic maritime location, and there could be no better place to study and conduct research!

Inside the data center, there are two departments: data and research. The data department has three sections: books, clippings, and cultural relics. Currently, there are over ten thousand reference books, over a hundred cultural relics, two hundred thousand clippings, and over ten thousand photographs. The most interesting are the clippings, which are collected from over two hundred newspapers, classified and pasted. The era covered extends back to the late Qing Dynasty, and the region covered spans Southeast Asia. Those shelves upon shelves of clippings are practically a living encyclopedia, and have become good friends to journalists, university students, professors, and experts here.

The research department is currently engaged in investigation, research, collation, and translation work. The books they have compiled include "Indonesian National Movement," and several others have been completed and are awaiting funding for publication. The goals of the center's activities are roughly as follows:

(1) Research on coastal provinces and cities, especially Fujian, Guangdong, Taiwan, and Hainan, in terms of history and geography.

(2) Research on national defense, economy, and culture in coastal areas.

(3) Research on various maritime industries.

(4) Research on overseas Chinese issues.

(5) Research on Southeast Asian issues and Pacific issues. The collection and research of data are based on the above five items, and relevant reference materials are also considered as much as possible.

This kind of work should have been done on a large scale by the government, but it seems that not many people are paying attention to it today. The center is just a few poor scholars burying themselves in their work, and they have managed to establish a certain scale in just over a year. It can be said to be a rising star in the academic world, and the reporter sincerely wishes it to shine even brighter.

Principal Liu of Northeastern University to Go to Beijing Soon

Mistakenly Conscripting Soldiers Sparks Student Unrest; Northwest Institute of Technology Incident; Hu Zongnan Has Handled It

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 11th] National Northwest University began a three-day strike yesterday in support of the "4/7 Student Unrest" at Northwest Institute of Technology.

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, Airmail Dispatch, 9th] Two students from the National Northwest Institute of Technology in Xianyang, Shaanxi Province, were forcibly conscripted by a recruitment company of the 167th Brigade passing through Xianyang Station on April 7, who mistook them for conscripted soldiers. The students immediately sent people to negotiate, which led to further conflicts. All students at the institute have now gone on strike to protest, and have elected representatives to come to Xi'an to petition the authorities and hold a press conference to report the truth.

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 11th] The "4/7 Student Unrest" occurred at the National Northwest Institute of Technology in Xianyang. The two injured students, Yao and Xu, have been transferred to the Northwest University Hospital in Xi'an for treatment and are expected to recover. Director Hu Zongnan of the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters quickly handled the matter, sending representatives and Chief of Staff Sheng Wen to express condolences and concern. The perpetrator, Shen, has been detained by his direct commander and will be handed over to the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters for court-martial. The student unrest is expected to be resolved quickly, and classes will resume soon.

Peaceful City Residents March in Protest Against Striking Students

Scientific High Altitude Exploration by Liu Dade

The stratospheric explorer, Jean Piccard, currently a professor of aeronautics at the University of Minnesota in the United States, is currently planning a nineteen-mile high-altitude trip. He has encountered countless difficulties and setbacks, such as those related to air, the press, university administrators, or purely scientific matters, but he has been able to overcome them one by one. This frail chemical engineer strives to raise his balloon, just to further explore cosmic rays. He now has a great desire to get a group of seventy-five Plaslics balloons up to the height where cosmic rays can really be studied.

The First Ascension – A Joke for Information

Piccard had originally planned another stratospheric trip last summer, planning to ascend to high altitude on a group of no less than seventy-five plastic balloons, each sixty-five feet in diameter, but this plan was delayed until this year.

In the past, many people regarded him as a strange person, and newspapers often treated him and his balloons as jokes, thinking that it was simply a stupid and ridiculous act to take the risk of high-altitude flight by balloon. But Piccard ignored these things, and although he may be the last person still doing this "ridiculous work," he still insisted on continuing.

His first ascension was held in October 1934 in Dearborn, Michigan. The balloon and gondola were designed and manufactured by him and his twin brother Auguste. The cost of manufacturing – $5,000 – was raised by friends and businessmen, and a bonus was obtained from the Chicago World's Fair of Progress. His companion on this voyage was his wife, Jeannette Ridlon. At 6:58 in the morning, 5,000 people were waiting for their first ascent into the sky, including the enthusiastic automobile tycoon Henry Ford, who stayed up all night to watch him.

This voyage rose to 57,579 feet (approximately eleven miles), crossed Lake Erie, and eight hours later, they landed on a wooded hillside near Codiz, Ohio. Just before landing, they calmly put on their football helmets. Soon after, a bold man ran into the woods and found them lying among the deflated balloons. Piccard's ankle was also broken. But they didn't take it seriously, but rejoiced for some things: (1) The lucky turtle, named Fieurde-lis, was still alive and well. (2) All instruments were undamaged. (3) A bag of letters reserved for philatelists was still intact.

The Second Ascension – Scientific Research

In July 1937, in order to test the theory that a cluster of balloons was more suitable for stratospheric flight than a single large balloon, Piccard sat in a bathtub-like gondola, which was tied to eighty white rubber balloons, and ascended into the sky in Rochester, Minnseota. Although his wife did not accompany him this time, she kept in touch with her husband via shortwave radio, and the content of these words was almost entirely to advise him not to fly too high. Six hours later, 110 miles from the starting point, Piccard, in order to avoid falling into the Mississippi River, managed to drop many balloons at an altitude of 11,000 feet to descend, and finally fell on a tree. He climbed down from the tree and watched his float slowly burn out. He hurried to a nearby place where he could send a telegram and sent a telegram to his wife: "Safe landing, excellent balloon control, equipment completely destroyed.

But in any case, after this flight, people gradually gained an understanding of his spirit. Piccard's next ascension would no longer be regarded as a joke, but as a scientific study. This is what he and many others have been looking forward to for a long time.

Focus of Work – Cosmic Rays

Piccard hopes to break the current ascent record (72,394 feet) and reach a height of 100,000 feet (approximately nineteen miles). The US Navy authorities have expressed their willingness to fund the cost of such an important voyage. Piccard plans to stay at high altitude for eight hours to allow ample time to make many scientific measurements. This is by no means something that rockets or unmanned balloons can do.

Most importantly, he hopes to gain a better understanding of the issue of cosmic rays, such as what cosmic rays are, why they can be duplicated, and what they can add to our current knowledge of atomic energy. In fact, we can say that Piccard was the first to use balloons to study cosmic rays. At the same time, if we ask a person with such broad interests and talents what he is most focused on, then we can immediately say that the study of cosmic rays is his main work.

Family Interest – Light Balloons

Every Sunday evening, they invited many guests to gather, and after the guests left, Piccard personally did the cleaning work. He used scientific methods to wash the dishes – using his chemical knowledge to determine which foods were best washed with soapy water and which should be washed with clean water.

His whole family is extremely enthusiastic about balloons. In 1934, Mrs. Piccard became the first woman to drive a balloon into the single-stream layer. On the next voyage, although the Navy Department did not allow her to accompany her husband, she was still enthusiastic about the work of an assistant. Their youngest son—Don—rose alone in a balloon in February of the year before last, and he was also the first to do so for young people. Piccard's twin brother, we know, is also a famous balloonist. He began stratospheric exploration earlier than Piccard. In 1931, he rose to 51,793 feet, and in 1932 to 54,120 feet, but now, he is planning to develop in the opposite direction—into the seabed. He will ride a spherical, free-floating submarine and dive into the seabed in the Atlantic Ocean near the equator to study everything he sees. If the plan is successful, he can sink 13,000 feet, which is almost five times the depth that others have gone to.

As for Jean Piccard, his eyes are still gazing at the sky, thinking about rising to a height that no one has ever been to. He mocks some people's claim that balloon travel is dangerous or too stressful, because he himself has no such feeling.

He said, "Some people tell me that old people are not suitable for such voyages, which is complete nonsense. Since this job has been prepared for me, I should do it well.

From him, we can see the spirit of a true scientist.

Secret Ink by Liu Suisheng

Military intelligence and love letters often use secret ink for communication to prevent leaks. In my spare time from studying chemistry, I have collected various types for reference:

(1) Paste or Rice Water – Use a brush dipped in diluted paste or rice water to write on paper. After drying, there are no traces. Sprinkle with iodine, and blue lettering will appear, very clear. Immerse in baking soda again, and the lettering will disappear.

(2) Ferric Chloride – Use a diluted solution of ferric chloride to write on paper. Wait until it dries, and there are no traces. Spray with potassium thiocyanate solution, and the lettering will appear blood-red. If sprayed with potassium ferrocyanide solution, the lettering will appear blue.

(3) Phenol – Phenolphthalein is dissolved in alcohol. Dip this solution to write a letter, and there is no color visible. Apply soap solution, and it will appear red; if you apply orange juice, the red color disappears, or sprinkle with ammonia, the lettering appears red; place on the fire and slightly bake it, and the lettering disappears again.

(4) Chalcanthite – Chalcanthite's scientific name is copper sulfate, dissolved in water. Dip this solution to write a letter, and it leaves no traces. Spray with ammonia, and it will appear light blue; if you sprinkle with potassium ferrocyanide solution, it will appear brown.

(5) Cobalt Nitrate or Cobalt Chloride – Write a letter on pink paper using the above solution, and the lettering will not be visible. Spray with potassium ferrocyanide solution, and it will appear reddish-brown. Or bake it over a fire, and blue lettering will appear; breathe on it or moisten it with water, and the lettering disappears again, so it is also known as invisible ink.

(6) Mercury Sublimate – Mercury sublimate is also known as mercuric chloride, which is highly poisonous. Dip this solution to write a letter, and the lettering is not visible. Spray with dilute alkaline solution, and it will appear bright yellow. Or sprinkle with potassium iodide solution, which will appear dark red; if you spray too much, the red color will fade completely.

(7) Green Vitriol – Green vitriol's scientific name is ferrous sulfate, which is soluble in water. Use it to write, and there are no traces. Immerse in potassium ferricyanide solution, and blue lettering will appear.

(8) Potassium Bromide and Sulfuric Acid – Dissolve the above-mentioned medicinal products in water and write on paper, and no lettering will appear. Burn it with fire, and it will appear golden yellow.

(9) Carbolic Acid – Write a letter with the above solution, and there are no traces. Spray with ferric chloride, and the lettering will appear various colors.

(10) Ferrous Sulfate – Use the above solution to write, and the lettering is not visible. If sprayed with tannins (commonly known as tannic acid) solution, the lettering will appear black. Strong tea can also be effective.

(11) Silver Nitrate – Write with the above solution on blue or black paper. After drying, there are no traces. Immerse the paper in salt water, and the lettering will appear white. Spray with potassium cyanide solution, and white lettering will also appear; but if sprayed in excess, the lettering will disappear again.

(12) Lead Powder or Lead Sugar – After writing with lead powder solution, blow hydrogen sulfide gas (ferrous sulfide plus hydrochloric acid), and the lettering will appear black. Write with lead sugar (scientific name lead acetate, highly poisonous) solution, and after spraying with potassium chromate solution, the lettering will appear bright yellow.

(13) Barium Chloride or Barium Nitrate – Dip the above solution to write on black paper, and there are no traces. Spray with diluted sulfuric acid or mirabilite, or Glauber's salt solution, and it will appear white.

(14) Miscellaneous – Take alum water, soda water, vegetable juice, diluted hydrochloric acid, etc. to write, and no lettering will appear. Place on the fire and bake it, and black lettering will appear immediately.

There are many types of secret inks, which cannot all be described; they are all based on chemical principles. As for secretly transmitting photos, there is also a clever method: the method is to immerse the photo you want to send to the other party in a mixed solution of potassium ferricyanide and ammonium bromide, and the black color will fade completely. Then send this white piece of paper. When the other party receives it, throw it into sodium sulfide solution, and the image will reappear, with a yellowish-brown color.

Piccard (Jean Piccard), the 64-year-old high-altitude explorer, is still gazing at the sky, thinking about how to make his balloon rise to a height that breaks the record.

Soundless Is Better Than Sound by Wei Ni

The man walked across the grass, running around, pushing a small box-like object in front of him. He may be using a prospecting device! But wherever he went, the green grass was cut short.

The neighbors ran over to see – was he mowing the lawn? They questioned each other, but why was his lawnmower silent? But the grass two or three inches in front of it always fell down, as if it had been touched.

The housewife put her clothes in the washing machine and pressed the power button. The water did not move, but immediately became dirty and foamy, as if a washing cycle had been completed. In fact, in an instant, the clothes became snow-white.

Eye-witnesses said that the work was carried out in complete silence. They were wrong. This may be the noisiest machine in the world, but the noise is all high-pitched and inaudible to humans!

This is the newest scientific strategy at work. This science is ultrasound, which is about sounds that exceed the range of our ears and have very high frequencies. The best example is a dog whistle. The dog owner makes a silent whistle, but the dog can hear it several blocks away.

Today, in war and peace, ultrasound has obvious practical uses. Scientists at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington have used ultrasound to mow lawns, and many laundries in the UK also use ultrasound to wash clothes.

Those "high-pitched" sounds violently agitate the grass stems, causing them to break. In laundries or dry cleaners, the sound waves vibrate the dirt off the clothes.

Ultrasound is useful in a basin of water, and even greater when used at sea – saving lives lost at sea. A scientist at the University of California has developed this method.

Ultrasound, when often performed in water, is affected by temperature and density, and refracted downward from the water surface and upward from the bottom. Thus, at a certain depth in a drop, it can proceed in a straight line. This plane is approximately three thousand feet below the water surface. This knowledge has been used to make rescue bombs. A sinking ship throws a bomb into the water, and it will explode at a depth of three thousand feet. Receiving stations are set up on islands and along the coast, constantly receiving signals from rescue bombs. These receiving stations also receive sound waves and can determine the situation of the accident in a matter of seconds.

This is not the first time ultrasound has been used at sea. During the war, the Navy's "Sonar" hunted submarines. The function of "Sonar" is: install an ultrasound generator on the bottom of the ship, constantly rotating in all directions. After each two-degree "pulse" is emitted, the generator is also used as a receiver. Any obstruction in the water reflects the sound back, and the submarine is located. The time it takes for the echo to arrive is used to calculate the distance of the submarine. The direction of the generator indicates the location.

Today, ultrasound can also be used to detect the location of icebergs, and the Titanic tragedy will never be repeated. It collided with an iceberg in the North Atlantic in 1912.

Pointing an ultrasound generator to the bottom of the water can measure the depth of the water very accurately. Sending "pulsed" waves vertically downward, and the time it takes for the echo to arrive, can automatically and accurately indicate the depth of the water.

In addition, ultrasound can indicate uneven points in alloys, which is of great help in making rocket launchers, and new alloys can also be developed.

Finally, ultrasound can turn heavy oil into gasoline, which may become the newest and cheapest method of oil refining in the future.

For the human body, it can help resist bacteria. It can kill certain types of bacteria, so it can be used to disinfect or purify drinking water. In medicine, ultrasound is very promising. German scientists have pointed out that ultrasound can warm bones without injuring them.

But if ultrasound can save people, it may also be used to kill people, like the death sound problem proposed by General George E. Kini. Yang Bai, a gray-haired, thin inventor, whose bizarre experience is of great importance to this problem, manufactured a "high-pitched" whistle. Although the whistle is not as big as an alarm clock, it can emit 25,000 watts of sound waves (ordinary radio receivers only have one to ten watts). Once, before he understood its effects, he raised the tone of the whistle to a range higher than the auditory range and increased the volume. He didn't hear anything, only felt that the muscles on his face were very weak and loose. He increased this "silent" even more, and his fingers stiffened. He forgot what he was doing, sat there blankly, feeling numb, for five minutes. The assistants in the room had the same situation. Later, a visitor walked into the room and turned off the whistle. Yang Bai and the others did not recover for several minutes.

A California scientist, Dr. Nada, exposed a young female mathematician to an ultrasound generator. Although she didn't know what effect the sound waves had on her, she only felt her brain power disappear in bursts. This woman, who could do the most complex math problems normally, now couldn't even do simple addition and didn't know how much two plus two was. But she recovered in a few minutes.

A chemist works in front of an ultrasound generator every day. He lost his sense of balance to the point where he couldn't even ride a bicycle until his research was over.

Ultrasound may focus crystals at one point, just as a magnifying glass focuses sunlight, with the same result. A piece of paper placed in the radiation will catch fire.

Although these examples seem dangerous enough to make death sounds, in fact, ultrasound will certainly be used to save people more than to kill people in the future. The Germans had tried to make weapons from sound waves, but their conclusion was also that they were impractical. Because ultrasound loses its effectiveness very quickly in the air. Sound waves with a frequency of 10,000 cycles per second decrease by half after traveling 700 feet in the air. But in the water, it takes 240 miles to lose half. For this reason, ultrasound cannot be used to kill enemy soldiers or shoot down enemy planes. The "victim" can only be seriously affected in the same room as the generator. Because these waves are blocked by walls and any obstacles. Yang Bai's whistle was enough to paralyze them in the room. But the neighbors next door didn't feel this disturbance.

Ultrasound has proven impossible in terms of death sounds, so for the future of mankind, it has great development as a "living" ray.

Free Talk: Scraps from a Journey by Bai Yong

Recently, things have been rushed, and I have spent several days on the train. Fortunately, I did not catch up with the 85% price increase, otherwise my wallet would be even emptier. From Suzhou back to Shanghai, people are always so crowded. It is said that there is a train in the afternoon that specifically departs from Suzhou and is hung behind the short-distance train coming from Wuxi. Naturally, there will be seats on this train. However, this day happened to be Sunday. According to the red-hat at the train station, the military did not add trains for the weekend. It is really unclear why. Weekends are holidays, and people want to go out. Why are there no extra trains added, which is the opposite of foreign regulations? It is really confusing. So we bought second-class tickets and squeezed into third-class cars, which took a lot of effort. Even stranger, a friend brought several pecks of rice because rice is expensive in Shanghai and wanted to reduce expenses a little. Unexpectedly, it was not allowed on the train and was said to be cargo, which must be paid for as freight. The price of rice in Shanghai has suddenly risen by several hundred thousand in the past two days. It is said to be affected by freight. Does the state-owned railway have to make money from this to maintain itself?

When the train arrived at Waikuatang, several people selling sugar cane and dried tofu came up. One selling sugarcane was an adult and a child. At first, the adult peddled, 10,000 yuan for four sections. When the child came, it was 10,000 yuan for three sections, because the child's were longer. In an instant, the adult devalued the price to 10,000 yuan for five sections, and the child also increased to four sections, adding that: "Look at the goods, that long one is also a section, and that long one is also a section!" He cursed as he muttered. Unexpectedly, the adult devalued the price again, and the child was not to be outdone. So in half an hour, it fell from 10,000 yuan for three or four sections to seven or eight sections. Finally, they were all sold out. This time it was the turn of the people selling dried tofu. They had to sell while paying attention to the crew on the train. If a railway policeman came over, they immediately rolled up their goods and sat on the chair as passengers. Their speed was simply beyond our imagination. Of course, they also engaged in business competition as usual, and they sold out in a flash. Then they started counting banknotes on the train, piles of 10,000 yuan bills were taken out from pockets all over their bodies, and they were sorted out. Many people stared at them intently. In the end, each person's income was over a million. They arrived at a small station, made a face at each other, and jumped off. This is the most realistic price reduction competition I have ever seen. If rice shops and cloth shops had such a day, wouldn't that be great?

On April 4th, Children's Day, I was returning to Shanghai from Nanjing. Unexpectedly, there were people who took their children to Jinshan Temple in Zhenjiang for fun. Fortunately, there was no fire that day, otherwise it would have been really disappointing. At Nanjing Station, there was still an hour before the train departed, and the seats were already full. Those who came later had to stand. A guy who looked like a civil servant saw a middle-aged mother sitting on a chair with three children, so he strongly demanded that the children give him a seat. The children naturally didn't want to, so he said with a grin: "I'm only going to Danyang. If you give it to me, I'll buy you something to eat." The children still refused and cried. The mother was kind and forced the children to come down and sit on the suitcase. The Danyang passenger sat down triumphantly with a smug smile, took out a cigarette and smoked leisurely, ignoring the children and their mother.

The seat next to me was constantly changing. Finally, it was a gentleman going to Wuxi and his companion. For some reason, while others were "fighting for seats", they gave way to each other. In this kind of situation, false politeness only annoys people. So a male passenger next to him took the opportunity to enter, and at the same time a female passenger also put her bag under this seat. When Wuxi arrived, the man and woman fought for it, and of course the man won. The woman stood aside silently in anger. When the Suzhou arrived, the male passenger got off again. Unexpectedly, a burly man sat down, claiming it for his girlfriend. The female passenger was angry but dared not speak, and stood all the way to Shanghai North Station. What does this show? – Roughly, this is Chinese-style survival of the fittest. As for Ladies First, it can only be applied when there are three guests and ten sofas in a spacious carriage?

### Java-China Match with Tung Wah: 3-3 Draw; Java-China vs. China Mixed Team This Afternoon

[Our Report] In the third match of the Java-China football team, yesterday's game against Tung Wah ended in a 3-3 draw. Java-China took the lead in the first half with a score of 2-0, ending the half at 2-1. Java-China showed improvement, while Tung Wah seemed to have a loose formation, underestimating their opponent. The audience at Yih Yuen exceeded 16,000, even more crowded than the second match, with ticket revenue exceeding 700 million. Tung Wah attacked fiercely but to no avail. At 17 minutes, Chen Hongyun flicked the ball in, giving Java-China the first point. Later, Long Hai committed a handball, and Huang Shuangquan took a free kick from the center line. Bang Lun rushed out, and Luo Tianxi headed the ball into the empty net, making it 2-0. Fortunately, Xia Ti made a header pass, and Li Yao scored, ending the first half at 2-1. In the first fifteen minutes of the second half, Long Hai and Xia Ti scored successively, putting Tung Wah ahead 3-2. However, due to a relaxed attitude, Long Hai acted irregularly, and at 27 minutes, Han Nibo was penalized with a penalty kick. Luo Tianxi took the kick, but Bang Lun pushed it away only slightly. Tianxi added another kick, ending the game in a 3-3 draw. Many players from Java-China were injured.
