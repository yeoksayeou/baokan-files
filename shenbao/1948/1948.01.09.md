Chairman Ma Hongkui of Ningxia also promised to support me, and those who support me will include all walks of life. For example, last year, student movements occurred all over the country. Fortunately, no unfortunate events occurred in Beiping, all because I maintained an objective attitude. I believe that the students' original intentions are good, so the students' impression of me is also very good." Li also expressed his political views, saying: China can gradually solve its problems on its own, and it is not necessary to have US aid. However, if there is US aid, the problems can be solved faster. China is willing to maintain traditional friendship with the United States.

### To Remedy the Coal Shortage in Beijing and Shanghai, the Ministry of Economic Affairs Proposes Five Opinions and Submits Them to Chairman Chiang for Approval Before Implementation

[Our Nanjing Office, 8th] In order to remedy the coal shortage in Beijing and Shanghai, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is trying to find ways. Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian has consulted with Zhang Jia, President of the Central Bank, and others, and decided to provide five opinions for Chairman Chiang's approval before implementation. Among the five opinions, the most important are to strengthen transportation and purchase foreign coal. The current coal shortage is not due to low production, but due to transportation delays. Large quantities of coal are stored in Qinhuangdao and along the Jinpu Railway, waiting to be transported. Chen et al.'s opinion is to request the chairman's approval to transport it by special train on the Jinpu Railway and order the military agencies not to add any obstacles. Foreign exchange is required to purchase foreign coal, so the chairman is also requested to approve it. It is reported that Shanghai needs more than 200,000 tons of coal per month. The original plan was to store 100,000 tons of safe coal in Shanghai, but now there are only 30,000 tons left, and it has recently begun to be used. Therefore, it is urgent to prepare countermeasures. There are nearly 50,000 tons of coal in the Huadong mine, which will be shipped out in advance. This is approved by the Army Headquarters. There are 500,000 tons of coal waiting to be transported in Qinhuangdao, which can be used to supply Shanghai. The coal stored in Huainan Mine is very abundant, which is enough to supply the capital and the areas along the Beijing-Shanghai line. In addition, the director of the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been ordered to go to Taiwan to discuss the transportation of Taiwan coal to Shanghai. If the above problems are solved, Beijing and Shanghai will not have any more difficulties with coal.

### Self-Sufficiency in Paper Can Be Realized in Three Years

[Our Nanjing Office, 8th] The spokesperson of the National Economic Commission said on the 8th: The paper we have ordered from abroad is sufficient for the first half of this year. After this half year, the domestic paper production increase plan has been realized, so there will be no shortage of paper in the future. He also declared that we will definitely achieve self-sufficiency in three years. In addition, we purchased 18 million US dollars of paper from abroad last year, of which pulp accounted for 10%. This year, it will be changed to increase pulp raw materials and reduce the import of finished products. At the same time, pulp raw materials will be allocated to various factories, and it will be limited that 50% of the increased production should be made into newspapers. It is enough to purchase 14 million US dollars of paper this year, and the rest will be given to various paper mills to add necessary equipment. This opinion has been agreed by the Import and Export Committee. He also said that the 20,000 tons of paper currently used in China are still orders from the first quarter of last year. One-third of the paper in the second quarter has not been imported, two-thirds of the third quarter and all of the fourth quarter have not been imported, so the current source of newspapers is very abundant.

### Special Envoy Ye Arrives in Kunming from Burma; Misunderstandings About Border Demarcation by Burmese Have Been Resolved; Rangoon Rice and Timber are Controlled by Our Overseas Chinese Merchants

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 8th] Our Special Envoy Ye Gongchao and his party left Rangoon by special plane and returned to China today, arriving in Kunming at 1:40 PM. Special Envoy Ye told our reporter at the airport: "Burma used to know little about our country, but the friendship between the two countries will be strengthened in the future. Si Jiao, Director of the Internal Territorial Division, previously published an article on the demarcation of the Sino-Burmese border, which caused a great response in Burma. In addition, the malicious propaganda of the Communist Party made the Burmese government and people feel very uneasy, and even rumors that our troops would enter Burma. After I explained that our country attaches great importance to Burma as brothers and has no intentions, I was relieved. Now the economy of overseas Chinese in Burma is very stable, and all the rice and timber in Rangoon are controlled by overseas Chinese."

### Once Our Currency System is Reformed, the Black Market for Gold and Banknotes Can Be Eliminated; Huang Yuanbin Makes a Speech in Guangzhou

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] Huang Yuanbin, a member of the National Economic Commission, said in Guangzhou: "From my personal observation, US aid to China should prioritize reform of the currency system borrowing." Huang requested that after the currency system is reformed, a method of unlimited exchange of foreign exchange can be adopted, and the black market for gold and banknotes will naturally be reduced, and speculation will be eradicated. Huang also believes that the reform of the currency system may restore the general price level to the pre-war level. According to the statistics of the ten years since the Anti-Japanese War, until May last year, the amount of legal tender issued increased by one time, and the price of goods generally rose by four to six times. Around October last year, every time the amount of legal tender issued increased by one time, the price of goods rose by ten times. As of the end of October last year, the total amount of legal tender issued was about 28 trillion yuan, and the amount of legal tender was about 10,000 times that before the war, and the price of goods rose to 100,000 times. The reason for the high price of goods, in general, is that the amount of legal tender accounts for one-tenth, and the remaining nine-tenths (that is, the 90,000 times increase in the price of goods) is entirely due to the people's disbelief in legal tender. Everyone is engaged in speculation, resulting in an excessively high currency circulation speed. Therefore, the purpose of reforming the currency system is, first, to solve the 90,000 times increase in the price of goods. Due to unlimited exchange of foreign exchange, there is no speculation, and the pre-war currency circulation speed can be restored, and the 90,000 times increase in the price of goods will be solved. That is, the current 100,000 times increase in the price of goods, calculated in current legal tender on the day of currency system reform, will suddenly drop to 10,000 times.

### Public Education Treatment Plan to be Discussed at State Council Today

Those above 30 yuan shall be calculated at 1/10 of the cost of living index, and adjusted every three months in different regions. The problem of the cost of living index and the extraction of the division shall be planned and decided by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics.

### Kowloon City Residents' Houses Demolished; Serious Negotiations with Britain; Supervisory Yuan Decides to Send Letter to Foreign Ministry for Details

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, Eighth] Regarding the Hong Kong government's demolition of residents' houses in Kowloon City, in addition to re-instructing the Special Commissioners of Guangdong and Guangxi, Guo Dehua, to earnestly negotiate with the Hong Kong government, the Foreign Ministry's Political Vice Minister, Liu Shishun, also lodged serious negotiations with the British Ambassador, Sir Stow, on the afternoon of the eighth, based on legal principles and humanitarian grounds.

### Demolition Issue Sparks Calls to Reclaim Hong Kong

[Associated Press, Nanjing, Eighth] Official and semi-official circles here are deeply indignant at the Hong Kong government's handling of the Kowloon City issue. A certain senator strongly condemned British imperialism. It is said that government officials are unanimously advocating the recovery of Hong Kong, but opinions differ on how and when to recover it. Some argue that the Hong Kong issue should be temporarily shelved during this civil war in the hope of maintaining friendly relations with Britain. Others advocate immediately recovering sovereignty over Hong Kong because, first, Hong Kong is currently a base of operations for all anti-government parties, such as the activities of Li Jishen and the illegal Minzhi Party there. Second, Hong Kong is currently a smuggling route. However, some observers believe that the activities of disgruntled politicians in Hong Kong are not enough to endanger the government, and the Hong Kong government has agreed to prevent smuggling. Foreign businessmen unanimously feel that the recovery of Hong Kong should not be discussed until the internal difficulties in China are resolved. They point out that Hong Kong is currently the only economically and socially stable place in China, allowing merchants to conduct business with peace of mind, and Hong Kong's trade indirectly benefits China.

Editorial

### How to Cure the Problem of Rising Prices?

Recently, because of the soaring prices and the people's livelihood being uneasy, the various calls for cracking down on hoarding and speculation, and controlling important daily necessities, have been shouted out along with measures such as stopping loans and stopping remittances. At the time when the Central Bank was about to issue large banknotes of 10,000 yuan or more, in order to prevent price fluctuations, a credit squeeze was implemented. Some believed that as long as some negative measures such as stopping something were taken, the rising trend of prices could be curbed. Who knew that those who stopped stopped, and those who rose rose, almost as unrelated as the wind, the horse, and the ox. So the brains of the big shots turned to control and cracking down. They always avoided talking about the fundamental methods of balancing the budget and stopping the increase of currency issuance, and only made articles on the negative aspects of abandoning eating because of choking. So the old methods of registering materials and inspecting warehouses, which were ineffective during the war, are about to be brought out again. The government is anxiously discussing, and society is also discussing. The mountain rain is about to come, and the wind is filling the building. Prices have "taken off" in these few days, seemingly intentionally giving people a stab!

We believe that the only cure for stabilizing prices is the eight characters "Increase Production, Balance Budget". Everything else is just a trick. As for hoarding and speculation, we must first clarify a few concepts:

First, there is a difference between so-called hoarding and speculation and legitimate inventory. For example, a factory accumulating raw materials, fuel, or even finished products, or a merchant storing goods of its own industry with its legitimate capital, although seemingly hoarding in form, is actually an investment nature, not a speculative nature. It is actually different from hoarding and speculation and cannot be equated. If it is necessary for the left hand to come in and the right hand to go out, causing the bottom to be exhausted and unable to be replenished, what benefit is this to the entire national economy?

Second, Shanghai is a hub for the collection and distribution of goods and is also a center of production. The legitimate inventory of various materials is not only related to the lifeline of industry and commerce in this city but is also the source of supply for various ports in the interior. When striving to eliminate hoarding, how should we take into account all aspects so as not to make legitimate merchants regard inventory as a dangerous path and flock to speculation, thereby endangering the vitality of industry and commerce?

Third, hoarding should be innocent, and speculation is only guilty. Because in times of material shortage, if there were no previous inventories, then when time is of the essence, the people's necessities would be threatened. Therefore, having hoarding is, at best, a matter of the high and low prices, and prohibiting hoarding may turn into the question of whether or not materials are available. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the industry in the rear was not interrupted, and the daily necessities of the people's livelihood were not lacking. Perhaps a part of it was still relying on the power of hoarding and inventory. Therefore, hoarding cannot be regarded as harming the national economy and the people's livelihood, and speculation for huge profits is not tolerated by society.

Fourth, when everyone mentions hoarding, they scold unscrupulous merchants, especially Shanghai's unscrupulous merchants. In fact, this is also a superficial argument. It must be known that the current hoarding is not in formal merchants, but in retail investors who have no way out for hot money. Retail investors are all over China and are definitely not limited to Shanghai. The reason why retail investors hoard goods is definitely not for the purpose of speculation, but to protect the value of the legal tender in their hands. Previously, the Central Bank's six million ounces of gold were turned into rings worn on the fingers of maids, elder sisters, and rickshaw pullers under such psychology. When gold could no longer be purchased, rural agricultural products and urban manufactured products became the target of retail investors' hoarding. Therefore, despite stopping loans and stopping remittances to Shanghai, prices are still rising, and prices in the interior are rising faster than in Shanghai. In today's terms of hoarding, almost everyone is doing it! Who is doing it? Who is causing it?

We must first understand these seemingly plain but essential concepts, and then assess whether the strategies of the big shots in charge of economic policy can cure the problem. Unfortunately, they are still unwilling to admit that this is caused by the devaluation of the legal tender and the lack of materials. Instead, they blame all the evils on the "unscrupulous merchants" who hoard and speculate. As a result, the "Extraordinary Period Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding and Speculation of Important Daily Necessities," which had long been ineffective, are once again regarded as treasures. In this way, all items must be registered. After registration, they must be inspected. If the inspection reveals even a slight suspicion, they can be confiscated and turned over to the public. Merchants will go to jail and face lawsuits. As a result of this panic, warehouses can be emptied, merchants will be forced to stop trading, goods will no longer be replenished, raw materials will gradually be exhausted, and factories will have to shut down. Even with money, it will not be possible to buy daily necessities, and social order will be difficult to maintain. Once the consequences are like this, how can we imagine? Government officials, worried about the country and the people, believe that the current state of the people's livelihood is all caused by unscrupulous merchants. For the benefit of the majority of the people, only by sacrificing a few unscrupulous merchants can the country be prosperous and the people be at peace. But I wonder if they have thought about the various considerations mentioned above? In the unlikely event that our concerns are unfortunately confirmed, wouldn't it cause pain to those close to us and joy to our enemies during the period of bandit suppression and rebellion?

The key to solving this problem is that the devaluation of the currency is the main cause. We should prescribe the right medicine for this aspect and stabilize it. If we want to crack down on hoarding and speculation, we must fundamentally make the hoarders have nothing to hoard. Therefore, we can make the following suggestions:

Stabilizing the legal tender and balancing the budget are not absolutely impossible. At the very least, it should be possible to stabilize it from the current situation. If the government seriously rectifies various taxes and makes them appropriate for the public, merges all redundant agencies to eliminate waste, temporarily eliminates unnecessary expenditures to reduce the burden on the national treasury, and sells the received enemy and puppet industries and foreign aid materials as soon as possible to withdraw the legal tender, then although there are huge military expenditures, it can still considerably prevent the increase in issuance. Moreover, the calls for US loans and assistance are very high, and stabilizing the legal tender should not be hesitated any longer. After the budget is balanced and the legal tender is stabilized, prices will also be stabilized. People will not be afraid, and hoarding will be defeated without a fight. This is a fundamental solution. We believe that it is much more effective than negative measures such as registration and inspection.

Replenishing materials is also easy to do. In addition to changing the "stop" policy and doing everything possible to support agriculture and industry to increase production, many materials are already in the hands of the government. As long as the government handles the distribution more seriously, at least the minimum daily necessities for the people's livelihood can be supplied. The most needed by the people's livelihood is food. The grain collected from land tax by the Ministry of Food should be able to regulate the people's food supply, not to mention the food from foreign aid? As for edible oil, the China Vegetable Oil Factory should be able to supply it. As for cloth, the government has already controlled 70%, and it may be able to assume its responsibility. As for fuel, there is already a Fuel Management Committee for the overall planning of coal, and there is also the China Petroleum Corporation for the distribution of petroleum. As long as the departments in charge can start from the positive aspects of "increasing production and opening up sources," and not just focus on making profits as their negative goal, it is expected that daily necessities may be full of markets. Once there are more supplies, hoarders will have nothing to speculate, so why hoard? This is an effective way to get to the root of the problem, and it is not effective by registration and inspection alone.

If the government officials regard the above suggestions as commonplace and only regard the "Extraordinary Period Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding and Speculation of Important Daily Necessities" as the only magic weapon that can still be used, then we are willing to further discuss tomorrow the reasons why this measure is difficult to implement, so as to correct the experts.

### Amended Draft of Inheritance Tax Law Approved by Plenary Economic Council Meeting

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, Eighth] The amended draft of the Inheritance Tax Law has been approved by the Plenary Economic Council meeting on the eighth. The draft was originally drafted by the Ministry of Finance. The main points of the amendment are: 1. Increase the tax threshold and reduce the tax rate: The tax threshold is increased from 1 million yuan to 100 million yuan, and the highest progressive tax rate is reduced from 60% to 25%. 2. Simplify the assessment procedure: If the taxpayer has objections to the tax amount assessed by the assessment agency, in the past, they could apply for assessment to the Inheritance Tax Review Committee, which was very inconvenient. It has been deleted, and if the taxpayer has objections, they can file a petition, re-petition, and administrative lawsuit according to law for relief. 3. Implement rewards and punishments to prevent tax evasion: The amended measures stipulate that those who report and pay within the time limit will be deducted 10% of the tax payable; otherwise, they will be punished to show rewards and punishments. 4. Implement in-kind tax payments: In the past, if the inheritance was in-kind, it had to be auctioned and paid in cash. Now, it is changed to that if the inheritance is auctioned twice and no one takes it over, it will be paid at the final estimated price. The in-kind payment is limited to land, houses, and public bonds. 5. Adjust the tax threshold according to the price index: In the future, the adjustment of the tax threshold will be adjusted once a year in January and July according to the national price index compiled by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, which will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and announced for implementation.

Method for the Collection and Allocation of Inheritance Tax on Dispersed Estates

[Report] The Ministry of Finance, considering that inheritance tax is a tax shared by the central and local governments, has already detailed the collection and payment methods for estates located only in one place. However, there were no clear regulations in the past regarding the allocation of inheritance tax for estates dispersed in various places. The following five new methods are now being drafted:

For inheritance tax on estates dispersed in various places, the main collection agency will fill out the receipt and hand it over to the taxpayer to first pay to the bank acting as the national treasury in the usual place, and list it as a special account for the tax funds collected on behalf.

The main collection agency will calculate the tax payable in each place according to the proportion of the estate amount in each place to the total estate amount, and notify the collection agency in each place.

The main collection agency shall fill out the payment vouchers for the accounts of the relevant collection agencies separately according to the treasury part of the tax payable in the local and other places, and pay them into the local treasury. The treasury shall directly send the receipt and the reporting link to the revenue agency specified in the payment voucher. (When submitting the payment voucher, a check from a special account should be issued and submitted at the same time.)

The main collection agency shall indicate on the payment voucher that it has opened on behalf of the tax money of the local government has been sent directly by the collection agency that filled out the payment voucher on behalf to the relevant city and county governments.

The main collection agency should take out the tax money to be given to each city and county government in the special deposit account with a check, send it directly to the relevant city and county government, and send a letter to each city and county government to send the official seal to the tax collection agency in charge of the business after receiving the tax payment. The tax due shall be deducted from the allocated tax revenue.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Rigidly Stipulates Rice Prices for Various Counties; Must Not Exceed One Million

Wuxi Prices Out of Control; 15 Unscrupulous Merchants Arrested

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, Eighth] In order to step up the suppression of grain prices, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has made rigid regulations on rice prices in various counties, not to exceed one million per stone. Violators will be severely punished, but in order to implement the government's orders, it has ordered the relevant departments to properly plan measures to increase grain production and regulate surpluses and deficits in order to smooth the flow of grain sources. According to news from the Zhenjiang Power Plant and rice merchants: If the power plant machinery can be repaired and completed by the 15th of this month and see the light of day again, rice mills can work day and night, and rice prices may tend to stabilize.

[Special Dispatch from Wuxi, Eighth] Today, the prices in Wuxi City are becoming increasingly rampant and out of control. Rice, paddy, and flour are still unavailable on the market. In order to forcibly suppress grain prices, the county government has stipulated a limit of 1.18 million for white glutinous rice, 539,000 for flour, and 1.399 million for wheat. The provincial government ordered again to allow declines but not rises. In the afternoon, the price supervision team arrested 15 unscrupulous speculators from outside the industry, including Cai Sanguan and Hua Zhusheng. Cotton yarn opened at 41.3 million, soybean oil at 3.05 million, and the black market at 3.2 million. Other daily necessities also soared.

[Special Dispatch from Nantong, Eighth] Rice prices continue to rise, with top glutinous rice reaching 1.35 million, but market prices are uneven, with several prices in one day. Miscellaneous grains are also the same, especially wheat. Five oceans are weaker, and the cotton market can be said to be non-existent.

[Special Dispatch from Fuzhou, Eighth] The rising wind of rice prices in Rong has not yet subsided. It once soared to 1.75 million yesterday, causing shock throughout the city.

### Unlawful Individuals in Xi'an Transporting Banknotes to Shanghai for Profit

70 Billion Seized in the Last Ten Days

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, Eighth] Unlawful merchants and special classes have been trying their best to return large banknotes transported to Shaanxi by precious air transport tonnage to Shanghai for profit in the last ten days. Since the four banks stopped large sums of money from being remitted from Shaanxi to Beijing and Shanghai, the black market exchange rate has been as high as 20% to 25%. The air freight for transporting cash is only 275,000 yuan per kilogram. It is heard that some people dare to conceal it as ordinary goods by special means and entrust it to air transport. In this case, the freight for each kilogram of banknotes is only equivalent to the black market exchange fee of 200,000 yuan for remittances. Yesterday, an aircraft of China Aviation Corporation flying from here to Shanghai was seized by the Third Supply Sub-Office of the Air Force with a batch of cash, totaling 5 billion. Those who have been seized in the last ten days have reached 70 billion. The disposal method is being verified with the relevant authorities. It is heard that a manager of a certain airline was also questioned by the authorities about this matter.

### Future of Filipino Chinese Vendors Bleak; Request to Revoke Prohibition Not Approved by Supreme Court

[Central News Agency, Manila, Seventh] More than a thousand Filipino Chinese vendors here will definitely be subject to the city government's prohibition in the recent weeks because their petition to revoke the effectiveness of the city government's order prohibiting the vendors was rejected by the Philippine Supreme Court this afternoon. The reasons held in their petition were that the city government order was formulated by the Manila City Council and was unconstitutional. Officials of our embassy here still made a final effort yesterday afternoon to prevent Chinese vendors from being subject to prohibition, but according to general observation, the only hope of these thousands of Chinese will be very dim.

### Increased Canal Water Level Restores Shipping in Northern Jiangsu

[Report from our Zhenjiang office, 8th] At the end of the canal, there are ten dams returning to the Yangtze River, including Bihe, Fenghuang, Jinwan, Dongwan, Xiwan, Chushan, Lanjiang, Buzihe, Xinhe, and Shahe. When the water rises, they are opened to discharge water into the Yangtze River, and when the water recedes, they are closed to store water for navigation. Historically, the opening and closing of these dams has been managed by the salt affairs agencies with dedicated funds. However, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the salt affairs agencies changed, and no funds were prepared for this purpose. Consequently, the aforementioned dams returning to the Yangtze River were opened but not closed, allowing the water to flow freely. In particular, the Bihe Dam discharged water so uninhibitedly that during the winter water shortage, it was completely drained. The water level in the canal from Wantou to Yangzhou was only a little over three feet, hindering navigation and causing transport ships to suspend operations one after another, also disrupting military transport. Previously, the Jiangsu Provincial Government ordered the Canal Engineering Bureau to undertake closure works, setting a deadline for completion to facilitate navigation. Now, it is learned that the Wantou Bihe Dam was closed on the seventh, and the Lanjiang Dam is being rushed. Materials for other dams, such as Fenghuang, have been stored, and work will begin soon. Currently, the water level in the canal has risen, with the shallowest point being nearly four feet and the deepest point being five or six feet. All classes of ships have gradually resumed sailing.

### Implementation Measures for Economic Plan: Full Text of Agricultural Part Draft

[Report from our Nanjing office, 8th] The National Economic Council passed an economic reform plan on the eighth. The draft of the agricultural part of the measures is as follows: "Farmers constitute the majority of the national population, and agriculture is the backbone of the Chinese economy. Only with developed agriculture, a prosperous countryside, and purchasing power among the people can industry be sustained and society be stabilized. Therefore, developing agriculture and prospering the countryside are the main objectives of future economic policy." This has been listed as the goal of the agricultural part in the original plan. Considering that agriculture is for comprehensive construction and should be promoted by farmers themselves, but China's countryside is declining, farmers' knowledge is low, and production technology is poor, the government should provide effective guidance, encouragement, and protection. At the same time, experimental research, disaster prevention improvement, and management should be handled by a government-established, strong, and capable institution to facilitate promotion. Furthermore, large-scale agricultural relief materials from the United Nations Supply should have appropriate institutions and sufficient funds to cooperate in order to be effectively utilized. Based on the original plan, the implementation measures are formulated as follows. Original plan one (the content is very long and was published in our newspaper on July 24th of last year, omitted here due to limited space). Implementation measures: (A) Restricting farmland rent. Farmland rent should be restricted according to the following provisions to set the maximum rent amount: - In areas where land prices have been legally determined, the land rent shall not exceed 8% of the land price; 2 In areas where land prices have not been legally determined, the land rent shall not exceed one-third of the main agricultural product. Farmland landlords shall not collect rent in advance, but if it is customary to collect security deposits, the amount shall not exceed one-quarter of the annual rent payable and shall be calculated based on the local general interest rate to offset the land rent payable. Landlords who provide housing, livestock, fertilizer, seeds, or other production tools to tenants may collect appropriate compensation in addition to the land rent, but it shall not exceed 10% annual interest on the price at the time of supply. Land tenants who pay land tax on behalf of the landlord shall deduct it from the rent payable for the current year. County governments should mobilize village schools, rural communities at all levels, and cooperatives to implement publicity and assistance regarding rent restriction and send guidance personnel to rural areas to guide and supervise implementation. Appoint personnel to supervise the review and registration of tenancy contracts entered into by landlords and tenants by township offices. If the terms stipulated in the lease conflict with current laws and regulations, the landlord and tenant shall be ordered to correct them. Tenancy disputes shall be mediated by the county government organizing county and township rent mediation committees. (B) Self-cultivating farmers: The government may delineate the following areas as demonstration zones for supporting self-cultivating farmers: 1 Areas among tenanted lands, 2 Areas where land has been illegally distributed by the communists, 3 Areas along rivers that have been flooded and are undergoing reconstruction, 4 Areas where wasteland reclamation is being implemented, 5 Areas where the government and large-scale farmland water conservancy are involved. Private land within the areas delineated for supporting self-cultivating farmers shall be requisitioned by the government in accordance with the law. The land price shall be assessed by the government in accordance with the law and converted into agricultural products, with land bonds used to compensate for it in installments over a number of years. The repayment period shall not exceed fifteen years. The aforementioned land bonds shall be issued by a national land financial institution designated by the government. After the land within the areas for supporting self-cultivating farmers has been requisitioned and consolidated, it shall be divided into unit farms and allocated to farmers for cultivation in the following order: - The original landowners who return to self-cultivation; 2 The original tenant farmers; 3 Retired soldiers with cultivation ability and the families of soldiers who fought in the War of Resistance; 4 Tenant farmers and farmers from the county. The area of the aforementioned unit farms shall be determined by the government, taking into account local economic conditions and land characteristics. The recipients of unit farms shall pay the assessed land price converted into agricultural products to the national land financial institution in installments over a number of years. The payment period shall not exceed fifteen years. Before the land price is fully paid, the land received shall be used as collateral. If the unit farm received has been improved and re-planned by the government, the construction costs may be appropriately collected and included in the assessed land price. The recipients of unit farms shall pay land tax in accordance with the law from the date of receipt. However, if the farm received was originally wasteland that needs to be reclaimed by the recipient, the land tax may be exempted for three to five years. Unit farms shall not be divided in any way after they are received. If the recipient does not cultivate the land himself or rents out all or part of the farm, the government shall immediately recover the farm received, return the land price paid, and allocate it to another recipient. When unit farms are allocated, the government shall guide and assist in forming cooperative farms, and the measures shall be determined separately. Provincial and county agricultural institutions should guide cooperative farms to use new agricultural tools and machinery, improve varieties, chemical fertilizers, and pest control products. The Farmers Bank of China and the Central Cooperative Bank should provide as much capital as possible to cooperative farms. (C) Conducting soil surveys and land classification so that land resources can be used rationally. Conduct a national soil survey, adopt simple methods, first complete the survey of soil quality and soil properties nationwide as a standard for fertilization, and coordinate with the production increase plan. Start with the soil surveys of special crops such as cotton, tea, and tobacco, and then gradually proceed to the soil surveys of major crop areas such as rice and wheat. In coordination with the soil survey, conduct a national land classification survey, including topography, climate, plant types, current and potential yields, the size of farms, forests, and pastures, population density, and necessary matters such as land prices, land taxes, transportation, and transportation. Based on the results of soil surveys and land classification surveys, conduct land classification and delineate national agricultural areas, so that agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry can be appropriately allocated, and land resources can be rationally utilized. (To be continued)

### Marshall Shows His Hand to the Senate: Urges Passage of the European Aid Plan; Cannot Sit Idly By and Watch Western Europe in Crisis

[United Press Washington 8th] Marshall appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today to report on his European aid plan. Before Marshall's report, Committee Chairman Vandenberg summarized the outline of the Marshall Plan.

[Reuters Washington 8th] Secretary of State Marshall bluntly told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the eighth that if the Republican members of Congress were to carry out their threats and reduce the amount of U.S. aid provided under the European Recovery Program, it would be better to abandon the plan altogether. The current issue is whether to meet the needs of the plan or not implement it at all. A non-partisan plan would only waste U.S. resources and would not be effective. Marshall further stated: The way of life we know is in a state of peril. It is neither easy nor guaranteed that the New World is undertaking this unprecedented effort to aid the Old World. This is a calculated risk. All we can say at present is that this plan has a method of succeeding, but I believe that if we maintain the will to succeed, we will surely achieve it. Marshall went on to emphasize the following points: The aid plan must begin no later than April 1st of this year, otherwise, some of the basic conditions on which the entire plan is based will change. The estimated six billion dollars needed in the first fifteen months is the absolute minimum needed. The U.S. share of the aid amount for the entire four-and-a-half-year implementation of the European Recovery Program is between 15 billion and 17 billion dollars. Although the United States provides assistance, it must not interfere in the foreign policies of European countries or attach conditions that would undermine the European cooperation system. If the aid program is not passed by Congress or unfortunately fails, the national security of the United States will be threatened, and in fact, it will be tantamount to placing itself in an armed camp. He firmly rejected the Republican proposal to set up an institution independent of the State Department to manage the European aid program, forcefully arguing that there cannot be two secretaries of state in the United States at the same time. He pointed out that the Soviet Union and the Communist Party are determined to undermine the European Recovery Program, which will make the implementation of the program more difficult. At the beginning of his statement, Marshall emphasized that if a sound European economy is not restored, the hope of the American people and free people everywhere to seek peace, justice, security, and welfare for themselves and their descendants will suffer the most serious damage. During a period of famine, poverty, distress, and the resulting turmoil that threatens the 270 million people of Western Europe, social standards and political conditions in every aspect will continue to deteriorate rapidly. Sitting idly by will prevent them from escaping economic bankruptcy, social unrest, and widespread and violent political conflicts, and will ultimately lead to the collapse of the historical base of Western civilization. The forces of despotism that we fought hard to destroy do not appear to have been destroyed, and the vacuum created in Western Europe may ultimately be filled by forces that are the source of war.

### Marshall's Firm Attitude: Will Resign if Plan is Changed; Hope for Swift Passage of the European Aid Plan

[Reuters Washington 8th] Secretary of State Marshall's strong counterattack in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee against the Republican criticisms of the European Recovery Program has renewed hope that Congress can be expected to pass the bill quickly. Because this year is an election year and because of Marshall's own power in the realm of public opinion, his remarks are of great power.

Only a few members of Congress are willing to oppose this figure who enjoys bipartisan support second only to President Roosevelt. In addition, Marshall himself has never used the presidential campaign as a slogan and will never be accused of playing politics, so the support given to Marshall by the people is even more effective. In the twenty-four hours before Marshall appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to speak, when he entered Congress before President Truman to listen to Truman deliver his State of the Union address, members of both parties in both houses gave him a warm applause. Today, his statement in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee fully demonstrated his frank and resolute American spirit, reminding people of his achievements in assisting President Roosevelt during the war. Republican leaders do not oppose Marshall's aid plan in principle, but they are trying to reduce the amount of aid. However, Marshall has stated that if the amount of aid is reduced, it will become a useless relief plan and no longer a recovery plan. Observers believe that if Congress refuses to grant an appropriate management plan or appropriate aid funds, Marshall will resign and leave rather than be the captain of a ship that is not properly equipped. His statement in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the United States cannot have two secretaries of state is tantamount to implying his willingness to resign. 1948 is the year of the re-election of one-third of the senators and all members of the House of Representatives, and it is expected that no member will be willing to risk the great disapproval of ousting the most popular secretary of state.

### Vandenberg and Taft Differ on Aid to Europe

Republicans Find Symbol of Division

[Reuters Washington 8th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee began reviewing opinions on the Marshall Aid Plan on the eighth, and a symbol of division has been found within the Republican Party regarding the Marshall Plan. The differences of opinion within the Republican Party are becoming clearer due to the conflicting arguments of two Republican leaders, Senators Taft and Vandenberg. Vandenberg has deep trust in the Marshall Plan and is truly trying to fight for the plan on a bipartisan basis, while Taft has publicly stated that he advocates reducing the total amount of aid and expects that the debate on the bill in Congress will be difficult to end before July 1 at the earliest. Taft and Vandenberg both have strong support, so the incompatibility of their opinions may cause a split within the Republican Party.

### Truman's Speech to Congress Meets with Extremely Cold Response; Republican Members Respond with Jeers

[Reuters Washington 7th] When President Truman read his annual State of the Union address in Congress today, the response in the hall was extremely cold. The hall only applauded when the President entered and left the hall. In addition, only when he mentioned the anti-union law proposed by the Republican Party and reiterated his call for universal military training was there sparse applause in the hall. Observers say that this is because the Republican majority members of both houses are disgusted by Truman's proposals. It is expected that his call for people of both parties to abandon party views in this election year for the sake of national interests will not be responded to.

[Reuters Washington 7th] House Republican Leader Halleck commented on President Truman's message, calling it full of inflammatory language. If approved, it would increase government spending by billions of dollars. This does not sound like it came from the mouth of the President, but if it came from the mouth of a presidential candidate. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Taber believes that the tax plan proposed by the President will damage production and is a reactionary proposal. House Speaker Martin pointed out that Truman wanted to stimulate his sinking political status.

[United Press Washington 7th] In the report on the federal situation submitted to Congress today, it was unexpected that President Truman did not emphasize the current state of world unrest. However, he emphasized that the national defense of the United States must be strong. Afterwards, the President suggested reducing the taxes of citizens with lower incomes. Republican members were quite disgusted with the President's report and often made mocking sounds during the President's report.

### Wallace Comments: Considers it Repetition

[United Press New York 8th] American presidential candidate Wallace said on the eighth that President Truman's federal message was "old tune in a new bottle," no different from the purpose he proposed in 1946. If he were still president in 1958, his purpose would probably remain the same, and there would be no progress to speak of. However, Du still asked to amend the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, and the only bill he proposed that could pass was probably the Compulsory Military Service Bill.

### Rumor of Stalin's Death Spreads in Switzerland

[Reuters Swiss Capital 8th] The question is rife with rumors that Marshal Stalin is dead, but there is a lack of evidence. The Berne Daily of the Swiss Democratic Socialist Party said that the idea that Stalin is dead could not be denied by the Russians in Switzerland. In the past, when such rumors were spread, there were immediate denials. This time, although there are rumors, they cannot be verified, nor have denials been obtained.

### British and American Occupation Zones in Germany Decide to Establish Administrative Institutions; De Facto Equivalent to a West German Government

[Report from our office] London 8th Radio: Frankfurt News, The highest German officials in the British and American occupied zones of Germany have accepted the recommendation of the military governors to establish an administrative body. This organization is de facto equivalent to the government of western Germany.

[Reuters Frankfurt 7th] General Clay, commander of the U.S. military zone in Germany, presented the following six proposals by the British and American governments to grant Germans greater political autonomy at a joint meeting of Allied commanders and the prime ministers of the German states held here on the seventh: The number of members of the Economic Commission in the British and American merged zone will be increased from the current 52 to 104. The new members will still be selected by each political party in proportion to the number of votes they receive. The eight states in the merged zone will each elect two representatives to form a legislative assembly to exercise legislative power to supplement the Economic Commission. The prior and subsequent powers of the legislative assembly will be decided by the prime ministers of the German states through consultation. An executive committee will be established in the merged zone to exercise powers similar to those of a cabinet. The chairman of the executive committee will be the highest administrative officer of the Germans. A high court will be established in the merged zone to be the final arbiter of disputes between the German states. The banks of each state will jointly form a central bank, which will be controlled by the Allied military commanders. The central bank will have the power to issue banknotes, control lending institutions, and manage German import and export funds. Certain economic institutions and their powers currently controlled by the Allied military government will be taken over by the German Economic Commission.

### Splinter Faction of Japanese Socialist Party Urges Cabinet Resignation

[Central News Agency Tokyo 8th] According to today's Tokyo Minpo, Matsumoto Jiichi, leader of the left-wing Socialist Party, recently advised the cabinet of Tetsu Katayama to resign.

### Brazil Passes Bill, Outlawing Communist Representatives

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 8th - Brazilian capital dispatch: The Brazilian House of Representatives voted in the early hours of the morning to revoke the elected status of Communist representatives nationwide. This measure has already been passed by the Senate and has been signed by the President, thereby completely stripping the Communist Party of its legal status in Brazil. During the session, Representative Xavier drew a pistol, intending to shoot Communist Representative Gregoria, but did not fire. The session was temporarily suspended to prevent unforeseen circumstances.

### Moroccan Leader Advocates North African Independence Movement

[United Press, French North Africa, Tunis, 7th] Moroccan native anti-French leader Abdelkrim, now advanced in years, announced in Cairo the formation of the "North African Independence Committee." It is believed here that this will add another dispute to the international scene, potentially becoming a new arena for US-Soviet conflict. France is already busy dealing with armed independence movements in Vietnam and Madagascar, and this will undoubtedly make things even more difficult.

[United Nations Press, Geneva, 7th] The secretary of French Commissioner to Vietnam, Mr. Pollar, held an informal meeting today with King Bao Dai of Annam. This was Bao Dai's first meeting with Mr. Pollar since arriving in Europe from Hong Kong recently. The two will begin formal negotiations this afternoon.

### If the Marshall Plan Fails, Britain Prepares for Self-Reliance - Cripps Explains Financial Situation

[British Information Service, London, 8th] British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps, today announced the British economic plan for 1948 at a press conference. He stated that the two major goals for this year are to earn more US dollars and further promote a balance in overseas trade. If Britain earns 50% of its target amount of US dollars this year, the country will still have a US dollar shortfall of £300 million for the entire year.

Cripps addressed the difficulties caused by rising global prices, stating, "Even the quantity and price of imported goods are increasing." Cripps concluded with a statement regarding the Marshall Plan, saying that Britain would inevitably be in a difficult position regarding US dollars unless this plan is implemented soon. Without US dollars, Britain would be unable to obtain imports of food and raw materials from the Western Hemisphere, and we would also be unable to export coal, steel, and other important goods to Western European countries. If we do not receive assistance to alleviate our US dollar shortage, we will be unable to participate in the European recovery, and therefore unable to participate in the global recovery. We will have no choice but to revert to a policy of urgently seeking self-reliance.

### An International Conman - "Chinese Army General" - Wang Zhike Blusters

— Our Correspondent in Japan, Chen Luo

In early spring of last year, a frenzied "gold rush" era emerged throughout Japan, exposing the 50 billion yen worth of concealed goods left behind by the military cliques. Kyoto, which was at the forefront of concealed cotton cloth, was a region where brokers and agents from across Japan were covered in banknotes, like ants swarming on fat. The various factions fought openly and covertly, displaying extraordinary activity and causing a sensation throughout society. In the midst of this whirlwind, a figure suddenly emerged: "Chinese Army General Wang Zhike!"

Such a General

General Wang was said to be a leading figure in the Green Gang and a former member of the Peace Preservation Army Council. At his command, the 1.5 million-strong Peace Preservation Army stationed near Shanghai would mobilize at any moment. He owned the "China South Shipping Company" in Shanghai, with a total of thirty-five ships. Wang's Japanese name was Otsuka Hirokuni. At the same time, it was said that he was purely Chinese, while others claimed he was of mixed Chinese-Japanese descent. It is unknown which is the truth.

At the time, General Wang's confidants and staff included the once-notorious "East Sea Pirate" Ko Unryoku Ichiro and Captain Nakajima Yukinosuke of the Kwantung Army Military Police. They spread the word that "General Wang is responsible for all goods transported to China and is also responsible for negotiating compensation for goods with the authorities of the Chinese delegation stationed in Japan. He also has the power to divert a portion of these goods for use within Japan."

Upon hearing this news, the Japanese rushed to his door. Among them was the former Superintendent General of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, Marude Tsurukichi, nicknamed "Bald Crane," who immediately dispatched Watanabe, the general manager of Marutake Trading Company, to Kyoto to meet General Wang. Marutake Trading Company was a business jointly operated by Maruyama Tsurukichi and Watanabe Takejiro, a former secretary of the Police Department. The company was based in Tokyo, ostensibly selling agricultural tools for rural use, but in reality, it specialized in black market and controlled military uniforms and cotton cloth. As soon as Watanabe saw General Wang's demeanor, he couldn't help but be deeply impressed. General Wang's bald head was even balder than that of his master, "Bald Crane," and he was short, stout, and full-bellied. From every angle, General Wang appeared to be a top-tier Chinese figure.

Dream of Fortune

At this time, Kyoto businessman Wakaoji Tomofumi visited Kato Juro of Tobo Trading Company in Tokyo, saying, "The cloth that General Wang is handling for transport to China is planned to be processed and manufactured before being shipped, which will greatly benefit the domestic sewing industry." Kato was a former reporter for the Jiji Shinpo newspaper, who was now down on his luck. How could he not want to go to Kyoto to make a fortune when such a good opportunity presented itself?

General Wang leisurely puffed on a cigar and looked down at Kato, smiling as he indicated that he would tell the delegation to sell 20,000 bolts of cloth from the Mitsui warehouse to Kato.

After returning home, Kato immediately prepared 10 million yen in cash (approximately US$100,000) to purchase the cloth, but he did not hand the money directly to General Wang at the time. Another man named Takizawa Mitsuo also entrusted 8 million yen to General Wang's confidants for the same reason. It was said that he would be able to remove the Western cloth from the Mitsui warehouse on March 27th, but the date passed and the goods were not delivered, so he realized something was amiss. He then sought out Nakajima, but Nakajima said, "Don't be impatient," and brushed him off.

First Doubts

On the evening of June 15th, the president of Kaneko Industries in Osaka visited Kato, saying that he had previously met General Wang through an introduction by Wakaoji and had been exploited using the name of "Chinese Special Service Agency stationed in Japan," and was taken for 50,000 yen, etc., and believed that General Wang was highly suspicious. Kato had already spent hundreds of thousands of yen on interest and hotel expenses from the 10 million yen he had borrowed to prepare for the purchase, so he rushed to Ko Unryoku's residence that night to inquire about the matter, but ultimately learned nothing. He then went to the Shimogamo Police Station to inquire. According to the police authorities, "Are you asking about General Wang? He is a contemporary Chinese nobleman and a sworn brother of Chiang Kai-shek. During the war, he was greatly praised by Chairman Chiang for finding ways to transport salt to China!"

Salt Smuggling Incident

Speaking of transporting salt reminded Kato of something from over a decade ago. In 1933 (Republic of China Year 22), Osaka's wealthy man, Shima Tokuzo, suffered the misfortune of the "Salt Smuggling Incident," which caused a sensation at the time. Behind this incident was a man named Otsuka Kyuzo. Otsuka was a Japanese man who grew up in Kyoto and went to China at the age of seventeen, working as a tea server on trains in Manchuria, giving him the opportunity to interact with gentry and prominent figures. He then specialized in swindling between Japan and Manchuria. Shortly after the Mukden Incident, Otsuka told Shima Tokuzo, "I have now obtained a special permit to transport salt to China," and obtained 2 million yen from Shima Tokuzo. After loading the salt, preparing to depart from Kobe, they were immediately arrested by the Osaka Military Police. At the time, there was no clear provision for "enemy collaboration," so Shima and Otsuka were interrogated for a month and then released. However, Shima was bankrupted as a result. The most detailed investigation of this matter at the time was conducted by Kato, the current former reporter for the Jiji Shinpo newspaper. Therefore, Kato immediately realized that the current General Wang was the same as the rare swindling expert Otsuka Kyuzo from before.

On the 17th, General Wang was suddenly summoned by a certain Kyoto agency. His home was searched, and valuable cigars and penicillin, etc., worth approximately 700,000 yen, were seized. As for the key power of attorney and other documents, they had already been burned and destroyed by Otsuka's daughter, Ikuko.

Sentenced to Labor

Otsuka, who was first detained at the police station, has now been sentenced to five years of labor and fined 7,500 yen by the Kyoto Military Tribunal.

Finally, the reporter must add a note: Tokue, (51 years old), Kawashima Yoshiko's sworn sister, was originally Otsuka's ex-wife. Since she had been divorced from Otsuka for nearly ten years, she had no connection to this incident. As for the international conman "Chinese Army General" Wang Zhike, under the bars of a jail cell reflecting on the past, it is unknown what he is thinking!

These five businesses were branches from Changsha, Hunan, and their business was in cloth, silk, and remittances.

### American Merchant United States Lines Company to Establish Organization in Kobe

[Our Own Dispatch] The American United States Lines Company has established a branch in Shanghai for more than a year. The company's New York headquarters believes that there is a need to develop shipping business in the Far East, and recently plans to establish a branch in Kobe, Japan.

### Thousands of Tons of Rice Detained in Nanjing - All Released and Shipped to Shanghai Immediately

### Several Judges and Presiding Judges Promoted

The judges of the District Court have been handling various lawsuits over the years and have been able to maintain integrity, abide by the law, and perform their duties diligently. The Ministry of Judicial Administration has given promotions based on year-end performance evaluations to encourage them and establish a spirit of judicial independence. It is understood that several judges were promoted this time, including Judge Wang Jiaqiao, who handled the Jin Chao case, Presiding Judge Meng Tingke, who handled the Foreign Tigers case, Judge Zhu Yuhuang, who handled the Yu Shengxiao case, and Chief Clerk Huang Guangjue.

### Additional Courtrooms Added at the District Court - Causing Internal Disputes

[Our Own Dispatch] Since the District Court was ordered to establish additional civil and criminal courts and promote judges to presiding judges, the other judges have expressed dissatisfaction. Recently, internal disputes have been increasing. A total of 32 civil and criminal court judges, led by Judge Wu Shaochang, submitted memorials yesterday to Guo Yunquan, the President of the High Court, and Zha Liangjian, the President of the District Court. The original memorial stated: "It is learned that the number of criminal cases handled by this court has always been large, and the personnel are insufficient, resulting in a backlog of cases, which has long been dissatisfied with society. Recently, the Ministry of Judicial Administration ordered the establishment of two additional civil courts and three criminal courts, and approved this court to guarantee the original judges Huang Guangyu, Zhong Xianda, Shen Tianbao, Zhu Yuhuang, Shi Cong and other five members to serve as presiding judges, hoping to improve the affairs of this court. The intentions are good, but there are still shortcomings in this measure, and the positions are personally involved. The following points are respectfully presented to the president: 1. The presiding judges assigned this time are all promoted from the original judges, and there are no new people selected from outside. In addition, no other judges have been assigned to the court, so the actual number of judges in the entire court has not increased. According to the usual practice of various courts, presiding judges handle fewer cases than ordinary judges. As a result, the addition of presiding judges this time is equivalent to reducing the number of cases handled by eight people. How can the efficiency of handling cases be increased by doing so? The original intention of the Ministry may be to reduce the backlog of cases, but the result may be to increase the backlog. 2. According to the regulations of the court organization, the task of the presiding judge is to 'supervise the affairs of each court and allocate them', and to be a judge of the collegiate panel, and his task as a presiding judge is far more important than the administrative aspects. Moreover, according to the provisions of Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the same law: 'The collegiate trial is presided over by the presiding judge. When there is no president or the president is absent, the senior member of the court shall serve as the president.' According to this interpretation, the presiding judge who serves as the presiding judge should be the most senior person in the entire court. Among the five newly appointed presiding judges in this court, some are senior, while others have only been serving as judges for less than three years, and their qualifications are very shallow among the judges in the entire court. This situation is not only insufficient to meet the legal intentions and show prudence, but also sufficient to inspire others to look down upon it, which is not a reasonable move." (Omitted below)

### Petty Conspirator Imprisoned - Confessed to Having Leadership Desires - Fantasized About Organizing an Action Team

[Our Own Dispatch] Sixteen-year-old Jin Baoshan, from Shaoxing, using the alias Ye Yiyi, once studied at Gezhi Middle School. He suddenly claimed to be the captain of the Action General Team last year, and privately carved official seals and issued orders. On September 26th of last year, he appointed classmate Zhou Peirong as the captain of the squadron and entrusted Zhou to recruit 45 classmates as cadres, collecting a deposit of 300,000 yuan from each person. Zhou accidentally talked about it with the police station, and the matter was revealed. The police bureau, fearing that Jin had political motives, arrested Jin and transferred him to the court for investigation. Judge Zhong Xianda of the District Court opened a court hearing yesterday. Jin confessed that he usually had leadership desires, and was influenced by movies and comic books, so he wanted to organize an action team and serve as the leader himself. It was completely a "pretend" nature and had no political motives. After the trial, Judge Zhong sentenced Jin to four months in prison on the spot, and the official seal and orders were confiscated. This petty conspirator was thus imprisoned.

[Reported by this newspaper] Four batches of Soviet overseas Chinese in this city have been repatriated by the Soviet authorities last year. It is now learned that the fifth and final batch will be repatriated in March of this year, with an estimated number of over one thousand. However, it is still unknown whether all of them will be willing to return home at that time. According to sources familiar with the matter, some Soviet overseas Chinese in this city have recently received letters from relatives and friends who returned home in previous batches, complaining about the hardships of life after returning home, the cold weather in the country, and the harsh treatment.

### Young Man Commits Suicide Due to Marriage Problems - Suicide Note States He Was Forced to Death

[Reported by this newspaper] Lu Qiyong, the sub-landlord at No. 180 Jiangxi North Road, reported to the Hongkou Police Bureau at 11:00 AM yesterday that a tenant living on the third floor, Ye Wei, 28 years old, from Guangdong, had committed suicide by locking himself in his room this morning and was on the verge of death, requesting assistance. Patrolman Jiang Peili led officers to investigate and forced open the door. They found an elderly woman in her sixties, suffering from hemiplegia, lying in bed. A young man (Ye Wei) was lying on the floor. An ambulance was immediately called to transport Ye to the Gongji Hospital for treatment, but he died shortly after. A search of the room revealed a suicide note and an empty bottle of poison among the scattered items. The room was filled with the pungent smell of medicine. The deceased wrote in his suicide note: "Before the age of thirty, I have experienced all the hardships of life. My stubborn mother opposes my marriage, causing me to become disheartened, leading to unemployment, and all kinds of oppression, causing me to make bad friends." He also wrote: "Tang Wenzhan has no profession and lives by receiving stolen goods. He used the Triad gang to force me to death," and so on. Further investigation revealed that the deceased's home was bare. His elderly mother was over sixty years old and paralyzed, unable to move. It is speculated that the cause of his suicide was due to his unsuccessful marriage, unemployment, and association with bad friends, resulting in excessive spending and financial ruin, leading him to consider suicide. The body was transported to the morgue for autopsy in the afternoon, 　and no one came to claim the body. Fortunately, the sub-landlord 　Qiyong, remembering his fellow hometown ties, sought help from fellow townsmen in Shanghai to provide a coffin and burial.

### Heavy Artillery Fire in Shenyang - Communist Bandits' "Seventh Offensive" Intends to Attack Jinzhou

[Airmail from Shenyang on the 3rd by our correspondent] The Northeast, covered by thick snow and ice, has been hit by the Northeast Communist bandits' "Seventh Offensive." It is said that the Communist bandits call this offensive "a new one." During this freezing period, it is as if a gale is sweeping up sand and dust. Industry, mining, transportation, property, and life are declining and suffocating under the control of war and severe cold. This

war's beginning

was on December 12th, when the Communist bandit Li Yunchang's forces destroyed the Daling River railway bridge between Jinzhou and Goubangzi on the Beining Railway, and attacked several stations along that section, causing the recently restored Ping-Shen through train service to operate only three trains from Shenyang and two trains reaching Shenyang from Beiping. Subsequently, the service went from sectional operation to complete suspension.

The Liaobei bandits' 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 10th Columns, from places like Xi'an and Xifeng on the Pingmei Road, crossed the China Changchun Railway and gathered at Zhouyuan in Faku on the north bank of the Liao River, pointing towards Shenyang from the northwest. The Liaonan bandits' 4th Column, from the southeast, moved along the "Liaogong" and "Pan'an" railways, dividing into two groups heading towards Liaoyang and Sujiatun, attempting to threaten Shenyang from the south. This time, the bandits adopted a tactic of infiltration and creating gaps, seeking to capture

the core - Shenyang

In addition, there were two other objectives: one was to isolate Kaiyuan and eliminate the Kaiyuan garrison led by Zhou Fucheng, and the other was to attack the Liao Yaoxiang corps in the northwest region of Shenyang.

However, the 6th Division of the bandits' 2nd Column suffered a major loss first in a village called Shahousuo, 15 kilometers southeast of Faku. They were wiped out by the Liao corps. Subsequently, the Kaiyuan Zhou Fucheng's forces were able to break through the bandits' encirclement and blockade, making a strategic retreat. The majority withdrew from Kaiyuan and turned to defend Tieling and Shenyang.

At this time, the bandits were constantly engaging the National Army in the area west of Tieling, east of Xinmin, and south of Faku, and used a portion of their forces to cross the frozen Liao River along the highway from Faku to Shenyang, attacking the key point of Shifosi on the south bank. The vanguard even detoured south.

The bandits' plan

was to capture Zhangwu in the northwest corner of Shenyang and Xinlitun on the west side, and then attack the core. Therefore, they were using the 7th Column to attack Zhangwu fiercely, and the 8th Column to besiege Xinlitun, so they would not have to worry about the rear.

The National Army was firmly defending these two strongholds in order to delay the bandits' plan to seize the core. By the evening of the 28th, Zhangwu was finally captured by the bandits due to their intense artillery fire, and the bandits intensified their pressure on Shenyang.

On the 27th and 28th, the main force of the 3rd and 6th Columns of the northern bandits approached the western suburbs of Shenyang. The bandits' 4th Column on the southern route, except for leaving a portion to harass "Shilihe" and "Shahe" north of Liaoyang and "Sujiatun" south of Shenyang, mostly fled west, reaching the area east of Xinmin on the Beining Railway line, attempting to join forces with the northern bandits and attack Shenyang.

On the 28th, after the sun went down, the bandits began to

bombard

the "Yuhong District" in the western suburbs of Shenyang with mortars, and some shells landed in the "Tiexi District." At the same time, a small group of bandits reached the "Yuhong District." The National Army fired their guns and cannons, and the bandits were repelled in the middle of the night, which was the bandits' first attempt to tentatively attack the urban area.

At this time, Shenyang appeared somewhat tense. Peasants from the western, northern, and southern suburbs were mostly entering the city with carts, horses, and belongings of women and children to take refuge. The price of food and daily necessities in Shenyang was also soaring. The poor also started to loot food during this period, but eventually subsided one after another.

The bandit army approaching the western suburbs of Shenyang could only continue to

attack and harass

and gradually retreated and moved away. There were three reasons: first, Shenyang was prepared and the tentative attack was repelled; second, the air force dispatched large numbers of aircraft on the 29th, making it difficult for subsequent troops and ammunition to be reinforced on the snow-covered road.

Another reason was that the National Army fought a strategic battle in a village called "Wanjintai," 35 kilometers northwest of Shenyang. It was a village with scattered houses and complex terrain, which was conducive to attack but difficult to defend. The National Army stationed there was originally the designation of the 207th Division of the Youth Army, but now it was a team of new recruits from the Northeast Youth Army. On the evening of the 27th,

the bandits' 6th Column

attacked "Wanjintai." The four-month-old new recruits fought well for the first time, capturing more than a hundred bandits in one night and seizing more war spoils. After the bandits tasted the defeat, they bombarded the area with artillery fire on the night of the 28th. Houses, military personnel, and civilians were destroyed and suffered heavy casualties. The bandits also used "explosion heroes" to crawl with explosives and detonate them. By the 29th, the National Army had run out of ammunition and was completely cut off from reinforcements. Except for a few wounded soldiers who escaped from the pile of corpses after the bandits retreated, the two battalions of more than 1,200 men were completely sacrificed. Regiment Commander Cai Yue died in battle, Battalion Commander Hu Xiufeng died in battle, and Battalion Commander Li Xiugu was seriously injured and his whereabouts are unknown. The walls collapsed, the houses crumbled, and the villagers who could not walk were almost either dead or injured. There were even more bandit corpses outside the walls and beside the houses.

Due to this tragic battle, the bandit's plan to make Shenyang fully experience

the artillery fire

was shattered. At the same time, the bandits had to abandon their first plan and implement the next step of attacking Jinzhou.

On New Year's Eve of 1947, Shenyang was relieved. The bandit masses gathered in the northwest region of Shenyang mostly turned to Dahushan and Jinzhou. The beginning of 1948 was almost the end of the Communist bandits' Seventh Offensive. Jinzhou may be the victim of the finale! (Special Correspondent Han Qingtao)

### Tragedy for Taiwanese Province Supervisor on New Year's Eve; Slices Open Abdomen in Suicide, Blood Splatters on Ceiling

[Our Taipei Office, 6th Air Dispatch] Zhang Dequan, a supervisor at the Chiayi engineering section of the Provincial Railway Administration, committed suicide by cutting open his abdomen on New Year's Eve in a gruesome manner. After cutting his abdomen with a sharp blade, blood splattered on the ceiling and covered his body. The man was from Hunan Province, in his thirties, and had worked as a supervisor on various railway lines in the interior during the Anti-Japanese War. He was usually quiet and reserved. Because his salary was meager, he was unable to support his family. Recently, he received a letter from his hometown stating that his wife was planning to remarry. He had been transferred to Taiwan just over ten days ago and bought a sharp knife, seemingly with suicidal intentions. In his suicide note, he only requested to be buried as a civil servant of the Railway Administration, stating, "Everything requires money, and without money, one can only commit suicide." It is noted that he is the third provincial civil servant to commit suicide due to low wages since the restoration of Taiwan.

The prices for 20-count yarn ranged from 37.75 million yuan for Ruyi, Five Sons, and Sailboat brands to 39.1 million yuan for Golden City and Golden Rooster brands. 6-count Vice Sunlight was 17.5 million yuan, 32-count Blue Phoenix was 51.5 million yuan, 40-count Blue Phoenix was 60 million yuan, and 42-count Double Strand Blue Phoenix was 66 million yuan.

[Report from this newspaper] The China Spinning and Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 91,470 bolts (equivalent to 103,830 single bolts) and 550 sheets. A total of 2,187 purchase orders were received, including 82 from manufacturers, purchasing 9,600 bolts of cloth, and 2,105 cloth numbers, purchasing 81,870 bolts of cloth and 550 sheets.

### Registered Cotton Storage Completed, Yarn Coupon Committee Begins Purchasing, Deadline for Yarn Storage Registration Not Yet Determined

[Report from this newspaper] Yuan Liang, Chairman of the Yarn Coupon Committee, met with reporters at the committee yesterday. He stated that the Yarn Coupon Committee, in order to purchase stored cotton, has completed the registration of stored cotton. The industry association was instructed on December 29 of last year to complete the registration procedures within ten days of receiving the order. All registration forms are provided by the committee, and the registration procedure is extremely simple, only requiring the reporting of the total quantity. The eight-day registration period has expired. If cotton merchants fail to register after the deadline, it is their own fault, and the committee will have to handle the matter in accordance with the regulations for cracking down on hoarding of essential daily necessities. As for the registered stored cotton, applications for purchase can be submitted to the committee starting tomorrow (the 9th), and the committee will purchase it at the market price on the date of application.

The deadline for registration of stored cotton for yarn factories in the city is the 10th of this month, and the deadline for out-of-town areas is the 13th. As for stored cotton in the valley areas across the country, the method of registering and purchasing successively will be adopted. The deadline for yarn storage registration has not yet been determined. The cotton and cotton yarn markets in the city will remain as they are for the time being until the implementation details of the committee's unified purchase of raw cotton and the agency spinning of various items have been officially announced and implemented by the Executive Yuan. The implementation details have been fully drafted after several days of internal research and discussion by the committee. Once approved by the committee's regular meeting on the 10th, they will be submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval and implementation.

### Yuan Announces Written Statement

The contract entrusting the Spinning and Construction Company to purchase cotton was formally signed with the company the day before yesterday. The purchase funds have also been fully allocated. In addition, Yuan specifically issued a written statement regarding the entrustment of cotton purchasing to the Spinning and Construction Company, as follows:

Regarding the government's purchase of cotton, I have repeatedly stated that it will not hinder the position or interests of cotton merchants. Recently, due to the urgency of the situation, it is necessary to find ways to rush-purchase domestic cotton from various producing areas, so the China Spinning and Construction Company is temporarily entrusted to handle it on behalf of the government, in order to concentrate efforts and facilitate management, and it will not affect the business of the original cotton merchants in any way. Cotton merchants can still contact the China Spinning and Construction Company themselves to purchase cotton, which is no different from selling to the committee separately. The points of contention raised by the cotton merchants at the meeting reported yesterday are completely misunderstood. As for the purchase price, it will be handled according to the current market price, which is the fairest and most reasonable method. There is no more reasonable price than the market price. I hope that all cotton merchants in the city will not misunderstand and act emotionally in the event of any incident.

### Rayon Rises Wildly

The surge in rayon prices continued unabated, with the market creating a new record yesterday. 120-count Asahi brand rayon opened at 20 million yuan in the morning, and the noon closing price for forward delivery was 21 million yuan, with 3.5 million yuan for deferred delivery. The situation was even more frantic in the afternoon, with the highest price reaching 35 million yuan. Many sold off at high prices, causing the price to retreat slightly. The final transaction price was 27 million yuan, with the asking price being 9 million yuan higher, an increase of 17 million yuan from the previous day.

### Golden Needles Soar

Due to the limited stock of golden needles, the production price in the producing area has risen repeatedly. The market price here has also soared, with an increase of more than 30% before and after. High-quality goods are close to 7 customs units, while lower quality goods vary.

### The Root of the Problem

— Bo Yong

Zhu Guangqian's article "Socrates in China" in the second volume, sixth issue of the literary magazine reveals the difference between scholars and ordinary superficial observers. The Socrates in this "dialogue" is naturally Zhu himself speaking his own mind. Zhu himself leans heavily toward idealism, and influenced by Croce's formal aesthetics, he specializes in solving problems from a psychological and philosophical perspective. "Literary Psychology" is his representative work.

In the article, the failure of modern Chinese politics and the suffering of the people are attributed to the lack of a systematic philosophy or metaphysics, as in ancient Greece for Europe and America. As a result, the thinking of the Chinese people is only fragmentary individualism, without a consistent theory to lead them on the path of collectivism and struggle. These words are indeed reasonable and well-founded, and point out the shortcomings of the Chinese people.

However, to say that all of China's failures stem from the lack of philosophy is something I can never believe. What is the so-called Eastern spiritual civilization, which even the foreign devil philosophers Schopenhauer and Nietzsche were fascinated by? Isn't it our ancestors' "that which is above form is called the Way?" From the philosophers of the pre-Qin period to the neo-Confucianism of the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, which point and which person was not metaphysical? Zhu said: Although this is philosophy, it is not as systematic as in Europe, and it is arranged after much thought. We certainly do not have a very thorough study of European Greek philosophy, but to say that none of the Chinese schools of thought are systematic is something I cannot believe. Modern people's compilations of academic history and philosophical history clearly list the thoughts of the pre-Qin philosophers in an orderly manner: ontology, theory of human nature, political theory, moral theory, etc. If we put some thought into organizing them, it would probably not be difficult to find a beginning and an end for each. Moreover, works such as those of Mozi are themselves very systematic. On the other hand, many Western philosophies are also based on dialogues and records, not created all at once.

In my opinion, it is better to say that China has too much philosophy than to say that China has no philosophy! Fifteen years ago, when the construction of a China-based culture was being highly advocated, some people advocated "complete Westernization," which many people opposed. In fact, the phrase "complete Westernization" has some problems and should be changed to "modernization," that is, "scientification." The biggest change in Westerners' lives lies not in their ancient philosophy, but in the fundamental changes in the mode of production after the Industrial Revolution. If machines had not been invented, we dare to say that Socrates and Plato would not have been able to defeat China. China could still close its doors and be an emperor, calling itself alone and diminished. Some people wonder why China's social economy has stagnated in manual production for so long. In fact, the stage of manual production in Europe was also long. China is only about two hundred years behind. However, science is different from philosophy. Philosophy is timeless, while science is constantly changing. After being baptized by Watt, Newton, Edison, Nobel, Einstein, an old society of thousands of years had a sudden change, and it is changing every day, every moment. Missing one step means that you can't catch up, and missing two hundred years is even worse.

Blindly believing in science may have problems, such as war and the lack of depth in American culture. However, this is because humans have not made good use of it. Just as fire can be used to drive cars and ships, it can also raze tall buildings to the ground. Giving up eating because of choking is always wrong. A country that can invade others at least proves that it is too energetic to conquer, unlike our acquired maladjustment. In the Qin and Han dynasties, China did have such glory. In fact, it was not that China conquered others with culture, but that it had improved its war tools and methods that it was able to win. After the victory, our culture would naturally follow. This accumulation of power was because China had embarked on the path of agricultural production, and its wealth and power far exceeded those of the Xiongnu and the Western Regions. Therefore, after a great chaos, the people were exploited by tyranny and became unable to produce, which inevitably led to a great decline in national power, as in the Song and Ming dynasties. Those who talk about philosophy always like to mystify these things, but in fact they are extremely simple. If China had Watt in the 17th century, Edison in the 19th century, and Einstein and Marconi Curie in the 20th century, we can guarantee that it would not be like this today. External invasions would not have been able to defeat us so disastrously. When the granaries are full, honesty prevails, and corruption and illegality are no longer a problem. Today's corrupt elements all understand the law, and none of them do not understand the principle of "when the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to?" The reason they still do it is simply because they are poor.

Greece is the homeland of philosophy, but Greece today is a chaotic country, and there are many corrupt officials. This is enough to illustrate the uselessness of philosophy. During the American Civil War, the people were in poverty, and there was also corruption. However, once life improved, it ended immediately. At this time, it seems that we don't have so much energy to talk about Socrates and Kant. It is more important to find ways to produce food, restore transportation, and improve life.

### The Affection of Flesh and Blood

— Jing Wen

Not long ago, the winter relief association used several large trucks to search for refugees in various places. However, according to reports, many refugees were unwilling to enter the shelters. Even when forced to enter, they tried to escape when people were not paying attention. Thus, the shelter seemed to be no longer a charitable organization, but rather resembled a concentration camp to some extent. There was food to eat, clothes to keep warm, houses to live in, and work to do, without costing you a penny. Where could you find such a good place? "How can we get tens of millions of houses, to shelter all the poor people of the world and make them happy?" Now that there are houses, the poor people are unwilling to "condescend," preferring to sleep in the streets, with disheveled hair and bare feet, enduring hunger and cold, and being baptized by wind and snow. This is truly puzzling.

But the actual situation is just the opposite. The wanderers on the streets are not born with cheap bones. The large number of refugees forced by the fires of war to migrate to Shanghai are not all single men. Wives, children, parents, and old and young alike have all endured hardships and escaped famine together. Now, those who are fortunate enough to have the strength to work or are young are sent to the shelters, leaving behind their families, parents, brothers, wives, and children. Wouldn't it be even harder to pass the time? The affection of flesh and blood is deep. Even if one person's stomach is not hungry and one person's body is not cold, how can they bear to see their children helpless and starving, their parents without adequate food and clothing, and heading towards death, and still live peacefully in the shelters!

"Carp in a dry rut moisten each other with saliva." Only the poor know the suffering of the poor. Sharing weal and woe is the supreme virtue of mankind, and it is also the expression of mankind's greatest love and affection. Only animal-like humans who have lost their humanity, in their eyes, these ungrateful refugees, who are unwilling to enjoy the benefits readily available, are truly the number one fools in the world.

### Waves Wash the Sand

— Gu Fei

Wen Feng's Another Trip to America Frosty Moon Turns at the Window, Cold. I wake from wine, the lamp is dim, long and short pavilions outside ten thousand layers of mountains… Shaking hands in the wind, a thousand words, forgetting to add a meal. Leaning on the railing to look far away, the leaves are mottled, the colorful clouds have wings to fly back. Do not say that life is easy to part, what is difficult to meet again!

### The Art of Speaking

— Jing Wen

As the saying goes, "illness enters through the mouth, and trouble comes from the tongue." The former is a scientific statement, and the latter is an experiential statement. Although illness does not necessarily enter through the mouth, trouble coming from the tongue is a profound saying. Often, what you say carelessly unintentionally offends others. A great man's words can build a country, but they can also destroy a country. Old novels often have the saying "a great man's words once spoken cannot be overtaken by a team of horses," which further illustrates the importance of a person's words. Even in the so-called "world of hoodlums," the saying of "making a point" is quite important, because even though it's "a point," it usually means you have to "shoulder the responsibility."

People who are good at speaking always take advantage of others. For example, when you see two people arguing on the street, the one who gesticulates is always the one who ultimately gains the sympathy of the onlookers, while the other one, red-faced and stammering, although full of reason, has difficulty attracting the attention of the audience.

However, being good at speaking does not necessarily mean understanding the art of speaking. Because being good at speaking sometimes inevitably invites frivolous comments, especially in public places, saying too many trivial things often turns oneself into a clown. Moreover, "trouble comes from the tongue," that is, saying too much invites trouble.

People who understand the art of speaking, although not necessarily good at speaking, always speak appropriately. Language is originally a medium for conveying meaning. If words fail to convey meaning, even if you are good at eloquence, you will ultimately fail to gain the respect of others. Therefore, the key to the art of speaking lies mainly in appropriate vocabulary. And appropriate vocabulary is related to personal cultivation and experience.

The most difficult place to speak is probably social situations, because most of the people you meet there are strangers. After the host gives you a simple introduction, you have to find a topic yourself and try to keep the conversation going, otherwise you will inevitably find yourself in an awkward situation. The "parties" that are popular among middle and upper-class families are a suitable place to practice social conversation.

The conversation between a couple is the most "romantic" and the most private. Only the parties involved understand such conversations, and the meaning of the conversation is often fleeting and cannot be recalled afterwards. You may already have a wife, but do you still remember the conversations you had with her when you were courting her?

Writing novels and making movies, the most difficult scene is to describe the conversation between a couple. When you see the line "Sister, I love you" in a novel or hear the unbearable dialogue "I love you, what's wrong?" in a domestic movie, you will only feel nauseous, which is definitely not the true picture of when you were expressing your love to her or him.

The attitude of speaking is also an important part of the art of speaking. Frankness and sincerity are two conditions that make speaking powerful. But the extent to which one should be frank depends on the speaker's own identity and the other party's position. Everyone says that they like frankness, which may be true, but there is one condition, that is, being frank to the point that it makes the listener uncomfortable, then it loses its elegance.

However, sincerity is necessary. Even if it is excessive frankness, if it is expressed with a sincere attitude, it can always impress the listener and not diminish their good feelings towards you.

The above is the art of speaking from the perspective of worldly experience, which is naturally full of hypocrisy. However, since you and I live in this world full of hypocrisy, how can we avoid it!

The most pleasant, most poetic, and most genuine conversation should be the conversation between two or three good friends over a cup of wine, because only in this situation, your words have no considerations of self-interest, nor a specific purpose, but are just for the sake of talking. In this situation, although the words are often incoherent, sometimes simply nonsensical, at the time you don't remember where the topic came from, and afterwards you forget everything completely. However, it is precisely this selfless talk that is the essence of speaking, and the poetic realm of speaking.

### Tea Talk

— Yi Tsun

I accidentally "rescued" a handwritten copy of "Separate Records on Boiling Tea" written by the master of the Tea Fragrance Room from a second-hand stall. The fabrication is shoddy and vulgar, so I thought I would say a few words about "tea."

Except for the first person who poured water into tea leaves and drank it to quench his thirst, who was a genius, the rest of humanity can be said to be "tea slaves." But tea was finally developed and expanded, not only becoming the "national drink," but also one of the few domestic products that my country exports.

Not only is drinking ordinary good tea, but the set of rituals described in the "Classic of Tea" can also bring out the function of tea. The true taste of tea is expressed in that half-drink, momentary, much laughed at, moment, when you have traveled long distances or worked until you are exhausted and your throat is parched. Expensive leaves, elaborate tea sets, extravagant cooking, leisurely mood, pretentious tasting, discriminating, [missing characters], this is just a plaything for the leisure class. In my opinion, the most difficult drinking of tea is in the homes of rural people, when they scoop a bowl of boiling tea from a rough jar and give it to you. That is truly a confidant of tea. They also have a humorous saying: "Our house may be small, but the tea leaves are very big!" It truly has a natural feeling.

### Words of a Hero

— And Then

General Patton, the famous American general, was the hero who landed in Normandy and went straight to Berlin in the Second World War. His military tactics were so brilliant that they repeatedly exceeded the estimates of Marshal Eisenhower. His illustrious achievements will last forever. Unexpectedly, he died in Europe in a car accident a few years ago, which meant America lost one of its bravest military geniuses! He kept a diary during the war, and reading it makes one feel his heroic spirit is palpable. Now, a section is extracted to continue the narrative.

"July 28, 1944. I received a verbal order from General Bradley, appointing me as the commander of the Third Army, and received initial operational instructions. On the 29th, I immediately went to the front line of Goulles for inspection. I saw an entire armored brigade concentrated there, standing still. When I walked to the command post hidden behind a church, I found everyone busy studying maps. I asked them why they hadn't crossed the Seine River yet. They said they were currently studying the problem and didn't know where to force a crossing. I asked them if they had made any progress. They said they still had to look at the terrain. I told them that before going to the command post, I had already tried to cross it. The river was only two feet deep, and the enemy's defense was only a machine gun, which had been shooting at me for a long time, but the aiming was really too poor, simply firing randomly. I told them a Far Eastern proverb: 'Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times.' Then I scolded them, asking why they didn't dare to try to cross. After this lesson, they became an extremely elite force.

"After dinner on the 31st, I went to inspect the headquarters of the Eighth Division on the right wing of our army. The division commander, Middleton, greeted me happily, because his troops had successfully reached the destination, Selune River. He asked for instructions on future actions. I told him that in the history of warfare, those who don't cross the river will be defeated, so he should cross the river immediately. We immediately discussed the method of building a bridge near Pontaubault to cross the river. Suddenly, the phone rang. According to the front report, although the bridge on the Selune River was damaged, it was still usable! Hearing this news, I was overjoyed. This was a good omen for the Third Army. At this moment, I heard that the Fourth Armored Brigade had captured the water gate east of the bridge, capturing four thousand enemies, which was extremely gratifying. In the march, I often heard that something was impossible to do; but in fact, it was done. The Eighth Division and the Fifteenth Division's crossing of Avranches achieved what was said to be an impossible task. I certainly knew that using troops in this way was extremely dangerous, but how could I be afraid of everything first!"

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Six: Such a Wonderful Evening (36)

Qi Wan was above this ten-thousand-foot cliff, in a dangerous situation. Zhu Zhai's words "I'm sorry" reached her ears, and she felt a slight tug in her heart. Immediately, her thoughts shifted. She sat up, walked to the washbasin, turned on the tap, filled a basin with cold water, wrung out a cold towel, wiped her face, and then wrung it out again and handed it to him, saying, "Zhu, wipe your face too." Although Zhu Zhai was exercising great restraint, in this quiet night, facing such a beautiful woman, and seeing Qi Wan so devoted and considerate to him, he couldn't help but feel a sense of kinship. His heart was a little restless. Qi Wan saw that he wasn't saying anything and couldn't help but turn around and smile, "What are you thinking about again? Why aren't you talking?" Zhu Zhai said, "I want to ask you a question." Qi Wan said seriously, "What question?" Zhu Zhai said, "I'm asking you: Can you wait for me?" Qi Wan said, "What about your wife?" Zhu Zhai said, "I'll divorce her!" Qi Wan nodded slightly and said, "I'll wait for you; even if you don't divorce, I'll wait for you!" Seeing her say it so firmly, Zhu Zhai couldn't help but step forward and tightly grasp Qi Wan's hand. Their eyes met, as if they had reached an extremely sweet and perfect state. They silently stared at each other, unable to say a word, only hearing the ticking of the clock on the wall and the rustling of the wind outside the window. In a moment, the glass window revealed a fish-belly white color; dawn had broken. The two leaned against each other, a surge of passion burning in their hearts. It seemed that they had a lot to say, but in the intertwining of joy and sorrow, they couldn't say it. At that moment, two rapid rings of the doorbell sounded outside. Xiao Wang Ma quickly rushed out to open the door. In the blink of an eye, someone was heard speaking in the courtyard. Zhu Zhai was surprised and wanted to ask who it was. Xiao Wang Ma had already run into the room, shouting in the outer room, "Boss, the master is here." Zhu Zhai felt that it was really inappropriate to be seen in Qi Wan's bedroom at this time, and he awkwardly asked, "Your brother is here, how can I see him!" Qi Wan quickly grabbed a piece of clothing, put it on, took Zhu Zhai's hand, and said, "It's okay, let's go out together to see my brother!" Zhu Zhai was ashamed and timidly walked out of the bedroom with Qi Wan. He saw Qi Wan's brother, Gu Hezhou, standing in the center of the room. Hezhou's face showed a slight surprise when he saw Qi Wan and Zhu Zhai come out together, but it immediately recovered. Qi Wan pointed to Zhu Zhai and said, "This is my good friend, Mr. Xu Zhu Zhai. He came to help me pack my luggage and didn't sleep all night. I've really troubled him!" Hezhou glanced at Zhu Zhai, a slight smile on the corner of his mouth, and said, "Okay, okay, you're tired. Qi Wan, have you prepared everything you should bring? We'll be at the station in half an hour." Qi Wan said, "I've prepared almost everything I should bring. Brother, you take the luggage first. We'll meet at the station." Hezhou nodded, glanced at Zhu Zhai, and went out. After Hezhou left, Xiao Wang Ma came into the room to serve Qi Wan and Zhu Zhai with washing up and breakfast and packed up odds and ends. After busying for a while, the time had come. Qi Wan repeatedly told Xiao Wang Ma to take care of the house carefully and to remember to feed Xiao Mimi (the cat). "If I come back and she's hungry, I won't be happy." Xiao Wang Ma smiled and agreed. Then Qi Wan and Zhu Zhai got into the car and hurried to the station. Zhu Qi saw that there were many of Qi Wan's colleagues and people seeing her off on the platform at the station, so he couldn't say much. He just privately exhorted her a few words and watched her board the train. The train started, Qi Wan looked out the window, waving a silk scarf. Zhu Zhai also raised his hat and waved goodbye. Watching the train leave the station, he couldn't help but feel lost! (End of this chapter)
