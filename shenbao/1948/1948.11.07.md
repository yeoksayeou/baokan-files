### Marshall Changes Previous Stance, Agrees to Comprehensive and Expedited Aid to China; Barkley States Assistance Will Help Stabilize Our Economy

[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] Official sources state: U.S. Secretary of State Marshall is changing his previous stance and agreeing to "comprehensive and expedited aid to China." These sources claim that Secretary Marshall, during his recent meeting with Foreign Minister Wang Shijie at the United Nations General Assembly in Paris, expressed his change in attitude. It is reported that Foreign Minister Wang has reported this new development to President Chiang. Marshall's change in the aid-to-China stance is deeply welcomed here, as in the past, it was generally believed that Secretary Marshall was the main obstacle to a comprehensive aid-to-China policy.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th] The newly elected U.S. Vice President Barkley stated: The U.S. will continue to aid China in resisting the communists and will do its utmost to help stabilize China's economy so that the Chinese government authorities can achieve success. When asked whether he believed the next Congress would take swift action on China when it convenes in January, Barkley replied, "The entire U.S. is willing to assist China." However, he pointed out that what measures Congress will take regarding the situation in China depends on the President's recommendation. Barkley further stated that although he has not yet discussed the situation in China with Truman, he is certain that the President understands the importance and urgency of the situation. He continued, "I believe the President will raise the China issue in Congress." Barkley was hosting reporters for the first time since returning to Washington with Truman. When asked whether the Democratic government would provide further assistance to China, Barkley replied, "This is certainly part of our plan." He stated, "I have no authority to make promises on behalf of the United States, but I believe the American people all want the government to do its utmost to assist China so that it can become stable economically and politically." Barkley emphasized that any new requests from the Chinese side would receive favorable consideration from Congress and the government. The new Vice President also stated that he originally planned to take the opportunity of his inspection tour of various Pacific islands on the 9th of this month to visit China, but the inspection tour has now been postponed indefinitely. He expressed his regret at missing this good opportunity. According to Barkley's above remarks, this is the first sincere expression from the new Democratic government regarding the issue of aid to China.

[United Press, Washington, 5th] A U.S. official said on the 5th that Chief of Staff General Bradley is closely watching the communist situation in North China, but has no plans to visit the Far East this year. He said that Bradley believes that from a military point of view, a communist victory in China would inevitably cause some concern in Australia, but so far there are no plans for countries in the Pacific and Far East to exchange views on how to stop the spread of communism. The official further stated that the question of further supplying China with arms to help it contain the communists depends on how useful this move would be.

[United Press, Topeka, Kansas, 5th] Republican Senator Clyde Reed said on the 5th that U.S. policy toward China is contradictory, which is tantamount to helping the Soviet Union control all of Asia. We say to European countries: "We will help you recover;" but to China we say: "You recover first, then we will help you." In fact, the Soviet Union does not particularly value Berlin and has to contain us in Berlin so that it can expand its power in Asia. The biggest task of the communists in America is to prevent aid to China.

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 5th] The Production and Marketing Administration of the Department of Agriculture announced on the 5th that several Asian countries can receive additional U.S. flour export quotas for the quarter from October to December. The new additional amount allocated to China is equivalent to 3,200 long tons (3,251 metric tons) of wheat flour. In addition, the Department of Agriculture, at the request of the Economic Cooperation Administration, has agreed to allocate China flour equivalent to 36,000 long tons (36,756 metric tons) of wheat to replace a previously equal export quota.

### Legislators Hu Qiuyuan and Others Express Opinions on the Current Situation, Propose Three Fundamental Guidelines

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Legislators Hu Qiuyuan, Huang Jianzhong, Fei Xiping, Qian Nashui, and others recently expressed the following views on the current situation:

Today, the fall of the Northeast marks the beginning of the darkest and most dangerous period for China once again. Everyone knows that the fall of the Northeast and its inevitable consequences will not only be a matter of the success or failure of this government, but is in fact a matter of the survival of the entire nation and the safety of the entire world. In order to save the nation and preserve its existence, we put forward the following three major proposals:

(1) Establish a National Unity and Responsibility

Cabinet　In order to concentrate the nation's strength and resist the invasion of the international communist column, we propose that within the constitutional framework, a national unity and responsibility cabinet be quickly established. This cabinet must include 1. people from all sectors outside the Kuomintang, 2. people from all sectors within the Kuomintang, and 3. influential people from all localities. If we can truly concentrate patriotic, democratic, capable, and representative figures from all sectors of the country to form an effective government, we will surely be able to overcome the threat of international communism and achieve national unity and stability.

(2) Confiscate the Wealth of the Rich Effectively According to Law

Property　Today, the concentration of wealth among the rich has in fact harmed the foundation of the national economy and the people's livelihood, arousing resentment among the people across the country. Whether to win back popular support, to replenish military spending, or to improve the financial economy, the government must resolutely confiscate their property effectively according to law; as for corrupt officials who harm the people, they must also be dismissed or punished.

(3) Promote the Conclusion of a Friendly

Alliance Treaty Between China and the United States　Today, the threat of communism is an international problem. We must discuss common defense with Asian countries and nations, and in particular, we must conduct negotiations with the United States on a friendly alliance treaty to safeguard the security and peace of the Pacific.

As for employing new people, implementing new policies, reforming local administration, training new armies and militias, and promoting agricultural, industrial, and commercial development, these are all matters that should be carried out vigorously. However, if the above three fundamental guidelines are put into practice, everything else will be easily resolved. We believe that apart from this, the entire country has no other way out.

At this most difficult time in history, we must raise our sense of responsibility, make good use of our wisdom, and under the principle of maintaining the legal system, recreate the vitality of the country. Defeatism and all impulsive ideas will only increase chaos. If human history must move forward on the path of freedom and democracy, then international communism will never conquer the world, and it will certainly not conquer China; if Chinese history must move forward on the path of independence, freedom, and democracy, then all corrupt forces and dictatorial forces that harm the nation will certainly not rule China.

The Chinese nation has undergone thousands of years of trials and tribulations, repeatedly encountering catastrophes, and has always been able to obtain its light. We have defeated the powerful Japanese imperialism and will surely be able to defeat the international communist party. The darkest of the dark is the beginning of the light. All patriots and people who care for the country, as well as the broad masses of the people, must rise up together and fight for independence, freedom, and democracy. The final victory will surely belong to the people of all China.

### Discussing the Temporary Property Tax Regulations, the Legislative Yuan Completes the Second Reading Procedure; Wang Shijie to Report on the Diplomatic Situation at the Regular Meeting on the 9th

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The Legislative Yuan continued its seventeenth meeting of the second session on the 6th, completing the second procedure for the Temporary Property Tax Regulations. The meeting opened at 9:30 AM, with Deputy President Chen presiding. 191 committee members were present. Continuing the agenda from the 5th, the meeting discussed item by item the items of taxable property in Article 8 of the draft Temporary Property Tax Regulations. The first item sparked heated discussion, and as a result, the first clause of the movable property section, "National Currency, Foreign Currency, Foreign Exchange, and Gold, Silver, Jewelry, etc." was amended to "National Currency, Jewelry, and Legally Held Foreign Currency, Foreign Exchange, and Gold, Silver." Article 9, which had been re-reviewed and amended by the Finance and Banking Committee after the currency reform to read "The calculation of the value of property shall be based on the market price at the time of valuation," was discussed. In consideration of the impact of currency value on valuation, the committee members resolved to restore the review amendment of the first session, "The calculation of the value of property shall be based on the market value at the time of valuation, converted into the currency value of the 25th year of the Republic according to the wholesale price index published by the Accounting Authority." Articles 10 and 11 were passed as proposed. After the break, there were two proposals for Article 12 due to review opinions, but the number of people present was less than the legal quorum of 155, so it was not immediately voted on. The meeting then proceeded to discuss Article 13. The committee members put forward various opinions on the property tax payment standard. Some believed that this article should follow the example of Article 9 and restore the review amendment of the first session, i.e., to levy tax starting from a total property value of 50,000 yuan in the currency value of the 25th year of the Republic. However, the majority of the committee members said that since the temporary property tax is aimed at the extremely wealthy, the starting point for taxation should be raised. As for the raised starting point, some proposed 200,000 Gold Yuan, and some proposed 1 million Gold Yuan. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. In the afternoon meeting, due to the lack of enthusiastic attendance of committee members, it was delayed until 4:00 PM before 156 people gradually arrived, only exceeding the legal quorum by one person. The meeting was then announced to be open. However, by 4:15 PM, the number of people present had decreased to 132. Fortunately, no committee members raised questions, and the meeting was able to continue. The number of each article was passed in an unopposed manner. Article 12 was amended and passed based on an unequal compromise proposal: "The net value of business property is divided among the various owners. When the other properties of each individual reach the tax payment standard, tax shall be levied on the properties of each individual. If there is concealment or evasion, and the shareholders of the business cannot find the individual natural persons, tax may be levied on part or all of the business." The tax payment standard of Article 13 was amended and raised to levy tax starting from a total property value of 200,000 yuan in the currency value of the 25th year of the Republic. The remaining Articles 14 to 25 were also passed unopposed. At 4:30 PM, the chairman announced that the second reading of the draft Temporary Property Tax Regulations had been passed, and with the consent of the attendees, the third reading would be conducted at the next Yuan meeting. The implementing regulations will be discussed after the tax law itself has completed the legislative procedure. The discussion of improving the grain allocation plan for the six major cities was abandoned because the committee members felt that the government was automatically taking measures on the various methods listed in the plan, so it had lost its timeliness. The remaining four proposals from the committee members were respectively submitted to the relevant committees for review or reference. The four review reports were postponed to the next Yuan meeting for discussion. Finally, the temporary motion of Yang Gongdao and others was passed, resolving that Foreign Minister Wang be invited to attend the regular meeting on the 9th to report on the three conferences of the United Nations General Assembly and the diplomatic situation, and the meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.

[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] It has been learned from reliable sources that Foreign Minister Wang has submitted his resignation, but was persuaded by the President to stay. Foreign Minister Wang's resignation is said to have been submitted individually and is unrelated to the cabinet's overall resignation, which has now been evidently abandoned. The Legislative Yuan said that the reason for Foreign Minister Wang's resignation was that as a result of his recent contact in Paris, he deeply believed that his previous policy of "attempting to compromise with the Soviet Union through appeasement" was a failure. It is generally expected that there may be a major change in China's foreign policy. In addition, based on Foreign Minister Wang's report, the Legislative Yuan has reopened efforts to pressure the government to publicly condemn the Soviet Union's destruction of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of 1945. A bill is currently being drafted and is expected to be submitted to the Yuan meeting on the 9th. The bill is actually a revival of the bill previously proposed by Committee Member Pan Chaoying. When the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan met, it unanimously advocated reviewing China's foreign policy, and then reopened the matter of publicly condemning the Soviet Union. It is understood that the organization of a Far East anti-communist front has also been proposed.

### On Materials and Prices

— Chen Junshu

Materials and prices are currently the subject of discussion in all quarters because they have a profound impact on the livelihood of the people and the finances of the government. I, in my humble opinion, would like to express my views for discussion.

It is the common desire of the government and the people to have an abundance of materials and stable prices. However, the production of materials has decreased due to the impact of the war, and the consumption of materials has increased due to the continuation of the war. As a result, the supply of materials is becoming increasingly scarce. At the same time, the amount of currency continues to increase, while its circulation area shrinks. Furthermore, due to the stagnation of industry and commerce, the need for currency decreases, thus the circulation of currency feels increasingly excessive. Therefore, in the above situation, the rise in prices cannot be prevented by the government's efforts alone. In the current situation, to ensure an adequate supply of materials and relatively stable prices, the government must impose reasonable controls on materials and prices. However, the control methods must comply with economic principles in order to be effective. If economic principles are violated, not only will the control be ineffective, but the consequences will be dire. As to what constitutes reasonable control, there are many grand theories in the country. Here, I offer my humble opinions for discussion.

Materials related to people's livelihood, such as rice, cloth, and coal, should be classified as primary materials. The rest are ordinary materials. Those containing luxury elements are luxury goods. The degree of control should be determined separately as follows:

First, the following controls should be implemented for primary materials:

(1) The government must take the following measures to increase the production of primary materials as much as possible. (1) Assist producers in obtaining raw materials; (2) Subsidize their working capital; (3) Guarantee their legal profits, and provide subsidies by the government if necessary, to encourage production. If prices are rigidly limited regardless of production costs, production will be suffocated.

(2) The government should take the following measures to prevent hoarding, exploitation, and excessive consumption of primary materials. (1) It is strictly forbidden for people outside the industry to hoard. The quantity of goods bought, sold, and stored, as well as the purchase price, of people within the industry should be reported to the trade association and the government for verification on a regular basis; (2) Minimize the number of intermediaries between producers and retailers to reduce exploitation; Distribute limited purchase certificates for primary materials according to household registration. Even if there is a large amount of currency, purchases are not allowed without a limited purchase certificate to prevent excess.

(3) The government should take the following steps to stabilize the prices of primary materials and the lives of the people. (1) Representatives from various industries and local organizations representing the people should jointly negotiate reasonable prices and submit them to the government for approval and implementation. This price must be higher than the price in the production area and the cost of local reproduction so that the source of materials will not be interrupted, the supply will be smooth, and the black market will not arise. The reduction of prices in the production area and production costs depends on efforts in production and the improvement of the objective environment. Furthermore, in the pricing of primary materials, the government should strictly limit merchants from exceeding legal profits in order to avoid harming people's livelihood. (2) The salaries of public educators and industrial workers should include a fixed amount of primary materials per person per month according to the above negotiated price. The remaining part is allowed to be negotiated by the respective competent units to accommodate their different circumstances.

Rationing in kind requires the mobilization of a large amount of manpower and involves complicated procedures. Judging from past experience, there is no rationing when materials are abundant, and they can be purchased. When materials are scarce, even rationing is interrupted, so rationing is equivalent to no rationing. Furthermore, excessive handling easily leads to abuses. Furthermore, in terms of the rationing system itself, the quantitative rationing of certain materials lacks flexibility and is not easily suitable for the actual needs of each family, resulting in the waste of such materials. Furthermore, the rationing system is only implemented in large cities and does not extend to rural areas and inland cities, which also gives the impression of favoring one over the other and makes it difficult to gain the support of all the people. Furthermore, the cheap distribution of foreign aid materials to a small number of people in large cities is also a loss to the national economy. This unsound system of rationing in kind should be abolished.

Second, the control of ordinary materials should not be too strict. It must be known that the increase in control agencies and personnel consumes national finances and people's strength. However, hoarding and speculation of ordinary materials must still be strictly prohibited in order to avoid stimulating other prices.

Third, the production and import of luxury goods should be restricted. Heavy taxes should be imposed on distributors and consumers to increase government revenue.

Some entertainment industries, when managed properly, dissipate wealth for the rich and provide a livelihood for the poor, which has the function of regulating the social economy and can supplement the tax system. Furthermore, the government can also collect taxes from this. Currently, productive enterprises are shrinking and it is not easy for people to find employment, so there is no need to ban them in order to provide a livelihood for the small people.

To coordinate with the above-mentioned material control policy, the following steps also need to be implemented:

(A) The prices and cost of living indexes in various regions must still be compiled as before to understand domestic economic trends. However, a uniform calculation standard must be used to avoid discrepancies. If the government can promote production and contract the currency, the index may decrease instead of rising every month.

(B) The prices of postal and telecommunications, transportation, and public utilities are too far from the domestic cost of living index and should be adjusted reasonably in order to avoid continuing to affect government expenditures. However, the overall situation must be considered and all adjustments must be made at the same time to avoid continuously stimulating prices. The new prices must still be slightly lower than the domestic cost of living index to avoid leading to price increases.

In the past, the currency increased by one fold, but the materials increased by several folds. This was due to hoarding, speculation, and improper measures. This is called a man-made disaster and can be improved through the above policies. As for the changes caused by the relationship between the quantity of currency and materials, only its effect can be mitigated. If it is to be forcibly suppressed, no policy can be effective. Furthermore, the rise in prices has the effect of suppressing consumption and balancing supply and demand. Within appropriate limits, it has a natural regulatory effect. At present, domestic order has not been stabilized, and all economic measures can only seek to reduce suffering comparatively and cannot hope to completely eliminate difficulties. The government's policies should consider the environmental situation and proceed in a possible and favorable direction in order to achieve the expected results. Finally, there is one point that must be specially mentioned. As the saying goes, "There must be a governor with governing law, and good policies rely on wise officials to implement them so that the promotion is maximized." Therefore, the downsizing of the administrative structure and the reform of the treatment of civil servants need to be planned and implemented as soon as possible.

### Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Qingdao Cities Determine Monthly Rationed Grain Prices; Note That Each Shi Will Not Exceed Fifty Yuan

The selling price of rice in Nanjing is 40 yuan per shi, Guangzhou 50 yuan, and Qingdao flour 35 yuan per bag. Because the rationing work in Shanghai, Beiping, and Tianjin for October could not be completed in a short time, the rationing price for this month has not yet been approved.

### Song Ziwen Sets Deadline for Completion of Yuehan Railway Nanling Branch Line

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou 6th Dispatch] Director Song of the Guangzhou-Sui靖 General Office recently ordered Du Zhenyuan, Director of the Yuehan Railway Bureau, to complete the Nanling Branch Line (i.e., Gouyadong Branch Line) by January of next year. The line is 40 kilometers long. There are currently two large bridges with a length of about 100 meters or more that have not been completed, and there are also many stone works. At the same time, the budget for the line after currency conversion is 4 million yuan. Currently, due to price fluctuations, the budget needs to be 6 million yuan. In addition to the 3 million yuan borrowed from the bank, there is a significant shortage. However, the line is the main line for coal transportation in Guangdong Province. Currently, Guangdong Province has only three months of coal reserves. Due to transportation reasons, it is difficult to transport Taiwan coal to Guangdong.

### International High-Altitude Observation

Starts on the 11th of this month

Taiwan Meteorological Institute will participate

[Central News Agency Taipei 6th Dispatch] The Taiwan Provincial Meteorological Institute will participate in the international high-altitude observation from the 11th to the 20th of this month. Because high-altitude meteorological observation is more complex, difficult, and costly than ordinary surface observation, meteorological agencies around the world mostly only engage in surface observation. Only a small number engage in high-altitude observation at the same time. Therefore, the high-altitude meteorological situation is still not very clear. The International Commission for High-Altitude Weather, in order to study high-altitude weather around the world, has designated November 11th to 20th of this year as International High-Altitude Observation Days and sent letters to meteorological agencies of various countries to cooperate and send the results to Dr. Bylawson, Chairman of the Commission, in Oslo, Norway for comprehensive research. The Central Meteorological Bureau of our country has instructed the Taiwan Provincial Meteorological Institute to participate in the observation. The Institute already has regular high-altitude observation in Taipei, Hsinchu, and Tainan. During this international high-altitude observation period, it will strengthen the observation even further. In Taipei, a radio sounding balloon will be launched once a day to measure the temperature, pressure, and humidity of the high altitude using a radio sounding instrument. At the same time, two wind-measuring balloons will be launched every day to measure the direction and speed of the high-altitude airflow. In Hsinchu and Tainan, two wind-measuring balloons will also be launched every day.

### Hangzhou Holds a "Poverty Relief Sale," Wuxi's Central Agricultural Bank Agrees to Temporarily Suspend Grain Purchases, Compilation of Market Conditions in Various Cities

Hangzhou [Report from our newspaper on the 6th] The Hangzhou market is once again experiencing a sharp rise in prices. Labor-management disputes are occurring in various factories, with workers repeatedly requesting wages to be paid in rice, but failing, resulting in work stoppages. Silk, cotton yarn, and daily necessities have all generally increased in price. After 5:00 PM, stores are closing early. In order to stabilize the people's livelihood, the municipal government is launching a "Poverty Relief Sale" starting on the 6th, limited to 20,000 households, with each household receiving one dou (a unit of dry measure) at a price of 5.6 yuan. In order to centrally manage rice resources, the provincial government invited the former Director of the Grain Management Office, Chen Yi, on the 6th to travel to Jiangxi Province to exchange 150,000 dan (a unit of dry measure) of salt for Jiangxi rice.

Suzhou [Report from our newspaper on the 6th] The economy of Suzhou is showing signs of recovery. Businesses selling cloth, candy, and a small number of department stores have reopened, but due to the limited supply of goods, prices have skyrocketed, and buyers are hesitant. The first labor-management dispute in the restaurant industry after price controls were lifted has been mediated and resolved by the City Defense Headquarters, and operations are expected to resume soon. However, meat is still unavailable. There are no transactions in the grain market, and no flour is being sold. Futures for generic cotton yarn on Monday reached a staggering 7,200 yuan per piece. Unless this threat is removed, stability is unlikely. Rice shops such as Dingfengsheng Rice Shop on Nanhai Street outside Changmen Gate, Qiantai Rice Shop on Shangtang Street, and Jiufeng Rice Shop were attacked yesterday by hundreds of impoverished people who destroyed their doors and looted dozens of shi (a unit of dry measure) of white rice.

The security authorities rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and arrested only eight suspects involved in the rice looting.

Wuxi [Report from our newspaper on the 6th] Today, the supply of grain is insufficient to meet demand. A buying spree occurred at the Yuanda Rice Shop outside the North Gate, resulting in the loss of several shi of rice. Due to the chaotic market conditions, some businesses have not yet reopened. Rice from Anhui is being blocked from being transported to Wuxi. After the blockade was lifted, the Central Agricultural Bank and other institutions transported approximately 70,000 shi of rice out of the area. Grain and flour reserves are low, causing public panic. The Central Agricultural Bank has agreed to temporarily suspend purchases. There are already over 6,000 students from various regions who have fled to Wuxi. Due to a shortage of housing and food, many are going hungry. Various public organizations have initiated efforts to comfort them and have requested that the central government not send any more students to Wuxi. This afternoon, various public organizations held a meeting at the Senate to decide to request the county government to implement the resolutions of the command post, requiring grain merchants to trade within the city and obtain permits for grain leaving the area, strengthening management of the grain market, requesting that a portion of the grain leaving the area be sold at a fixed price to provide winter relief, and requesting the government to allocate grain to Wuxi according to the methods used in the six major cities to ensure the people's food supply.

[Another dispatch] The Wuxi Command Post has recently notified the Wuxi Cooperative Treasury and the Farmers Bank to temporarily suspend grain purchases until market transactions return to normal.

Zhenjiang [Report from our newspaper on the 6th] The Zhenjiang grain market did not open today, and the entire city remains closed for business. In order to alleviate the grain shortage, the authorities have recently borrowed 2 million yuan from various banks to be used by grain merchants to purchase and transport grain from producing areas to Zhenjiang for emergency relief.

Yangzhou [Report from our newspaper on the 6th] The market has become increasingly chaotic in recent days, and transactions remain at a standstill. Negotiated prices are unstable, and labor costs have temporarily doubled, with adjustments made every half month. Jiangyin [Report from our newspaper on the 6th] Negotiated prices in the city have not been finalized, and the market is still difficult to recover. Prices for rice and yarn are chaotic. Over 9,400 shi of rice and paddy rice have been detained at Huangtiangang. The Wuxi Command Post has decided to allow 5,500 shi of rice, 530 shi of paddy rice from Nantong, 600 shi of paddy rice from Jingjiang, and 2,000 shi of rice from Qidong and Haimen to be released. Those without permits or with discrepancies between permits and goods will be sold at a fixed price in Cheng City.

Hankou [Report from our newspaper on the 6th] The supply of rice in Hankou is increasing, but prices have slightly risen. There are no major fluctuations in the prices of other goods.

Chongqing [Report from our newspaper on the 6th] The detention of 25,000 dan of grain from Hechuan being transported to Chongqing is currently under mediation. Prices for cotton yarn are chaotic. The distribution office is registering and reviewing, and plans to set the price at 85 yuan per small piece.

Chengdu [Report from our newspaper on the 5th] The Sichuan Economic Management Committee implemented new price control measures for the entire province on the 5th, including registering all materials in Sichuan, implementing cost-based pricing, investigating and seizing hoarding and speculation, and registering and supervising the sale of grain. Prices in Chengdu rose again on the 5th. The transportation of goods was unblocked, and a large amount of capital flowed out. Immediate promissory notes for 1,010 yuan were traded for over 100,000 yuan, and the market was active.

### Polish Representative Denounces U.S. Foreign Policy at UN General Assembly Meeting, Expanding Bases Solely for Selfish Interests

[United Press, Paris, 6th] Polish representative Katz-Suchy denounced the United States today in the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly for establishing military bases in Spain. He stated, "We all know that the United States is trying to create a vast empire whose territory far exceeds its own. The United States is applying what Senator Taft called 'Dollar Diplomacy.' Everyone knows that the United States is building bases in Britain, Spain, North Africa, and the Pacific, and we also know that the United States is unwilling to protest and refuses to leave Greenland." Katz-Suchy cited Truman's words to confirm the communist accusation that the United States is not as selfless as it claims. Katz-Suchy repeatedly attacked Dulles, stating, "Truman said that the United States does not seek selfish interests, land, or rights from this war victory, but the United States must possess bases that military experts deem necessary for the defense of the Americas. This fully demonstrates that the U.S. representative's boast that its interests are never selfish is completely overturned by Truman's words." He stated that Dulles dislikes communists but likes fascists, and Dulles dislikes the Soviet Union but likes Franco's Spain. He continued, "Mr. Dulles participated in a fascist organization called 'X' and received subsidies from the U.S. Treasury Department." This clearly refers to the "X" party, which is a Greek restoration party. He concluded, "No one can influence Mr. Dulles's likes and dislikes—that is his private matter."

[Associated Press, Paris, 6th] During today's debate on the Balkans issue in the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly, the Polish representative vehemently attacked U.S. representative and Republican leader Dulles, stating, "Everyone knows that the United States is trying to establish an empire. Mr. Dulles does not need to tell us that this action is not selfish. When the Nazis invaded Poland, Dulles tried his best to prevent the United States from participating in the European war." Dulles replied that he had been attacked personally more than once, and had never responded. He did not intend to reply this time either, as he believed that representatives should have self-control to avoid harming the dignity of the assembly.

### Truman Begins Two-Week Vacation Today, Preparing to Draft Legislation, Fue Will Demand That the U.S. Congress Repeal Labor Law

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] After returning to Washington, President Truman held an informal meeting with cabinet ministers, but the matters discussed were not disclosed.

This is the president's first long vacation in February. The legislative agenda is extensive, including a new anti-inflation plan. It is said that the price control bill will include many recommendations that the Republican Congress has rejected.

[United Press, Washington, 5th] Senator McClellan said on the 5th that he would move to repeal the Taft-Hartley Labor Act "to better meet the will of the people."

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] According to well-informed sources, the first person Truman met after being elected was Murray of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. He told Murray that he had decided to amend the current labor law and improve the living conditions of American workers. According to the same sources, Truman has already begun to act, demanding that Congress repeal the Taft-Hartley Act and establish an inflation control bill.

### Soviet Union Uses Secret Czechoslovakian Air Route to Supply Arms to Israel, Czechoslovakia's Reply to U.S. Protest Failed to Satisfy U.S.

[United Press, Paris, 5th] It was revealed on the 5th that the United States, Britain, and France have received detailed information that Israel is receiving arms, aircraft, and recruited soldiers from communist Czechoslovakia through a secret air route. Part of this information has been sent to UN Acting Mediator for Palestine, Count Bernadotte.

According to preliminary reports received by Allied intelligence personnel, the Soviet Union is airlifting arms to Israel through a secret route. They later stated that the Soviet Union was not involved in maintaining this route. However, an Israeli defector stated that the Jewish side received a great deal of Soviet assistance in operating the route. It is said that the arms were transported from Czechoslovakia and originated from the Skoda arms factory. The aircraft were obtained through resale and originated from as far away as the United States and Latin American countries.

[United Press, Paris, 6th] A British spokesman said on the 6th that Britain had asked UN mediator for Palestine, Count Bernadotte, not to submit the report on the Soviet Union using Czechoslovakia as a route to airlift arms to Israel to the Security Council. The British side believes that the testimony of the Israeli defector is not sufficient and cannot be submitted to the Security Council for action. He stated that the report indicated that illegal arms trafficking was not limited to Czechoslovakia alone, but also involved Panama and Italy. The spokesman said that if more evidence is received, it may be submitted to the Security Council. However, others said that if the airlift issue is raised publicly in the Security Council, Western countries may have a lot of trouble. It was previously rumored that the UN General Assembly would fully debate the permanent solution to the Palestine issue next week, while the smuggling of contraband arms would be discussed behind the scenes.

[United Press, Washington, 5th] The State Department revealed on the 5th that the United States had previously requested the Czechoslovak authorities to stop illegally transporting arms to the Israeli government. Czechoslovakia has replied, but this reply is "completely unsatisfactory." A State Department spokesman said that the Czechoslovak government did not deny that the arms transport was continuing. On the other hand, although the United States has requested a halt, arms from Czechoslovakia are still flowing to Israel.

### Apprentice Meets Swindler While Exchanging Small Bills for Large Bills

[Our Newspaper] Hou Wenkui, a 17-year-old apprentice from Shaoxing at the Lichang Dyeing Shop at 37 Lane, 30 North Shanxi Road, was ordered to withdraw a deposit of 1,350 gold yuan from the bank at around 11:00 AM yesterday. On the way back, while passing Henan Road and Tianjin Road, he encountered two strangers. One of them, dressed in military uniform, approached him and falsely claimed that he had small bills that were inconvenient to carry and asked if he could exchange them for large bills. He showed a stack of one-yuan gold yuan bills on the spot. Hou, being young and ignorant, trusted him without suspicion and handed over the money. When he returned and opened the package, he discovered that the inner parts of the gold yuan stacks were all 10,000-yuan bills in legal tender. He then reported the situation to the Huangpu Police Substation and requested an investigation.

### Two Security Guards at Huiluo Company Detained for Gang-Raping a Lost Country Woman

[Our Newspaper] Zhu Huizhen, a 35-year-old woman from Xiashi, took the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to Shanghai the day before yesterday to look for her younger brother. Because she was unfamiliar with the area and the street name "Xu Street" on the address she had was also incorrect, she asked around without success. After dark, she went to the entrance of the Huiji Company at Sichuan Middle Road, Nanjing East Road. The security guard Qi Yongchun, a native of Nantong, saw her plight and forced her to the company building, where he forcibly raped her. From 10:00 PM the night before last until after 11:00 PM, he feared that the matter would be exposed and introduced Zhu to an Indian security guard, Wan Hanxing, for rape. By dawn, Zhu had been injured, so they gave her five gold yuan and told her to leave. Zhu reported the incident to a patrolling police officer on her way, who sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment. The Huangpu Police Bureau arrested Qin and Shou, who confessed to the rape. They were charged with obstructing freedom and indecency and will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation on Monday.

It was resolved that the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association would organize joint sales, exclusively for cotton cloth retailers. The allocation method will be formulated separately. The general principle of allocation will be based on the quotation and verification method used by the Textile Construction Corporation in the past for cotton cloth sales.

Cotton Yarn Prices Rise Madly; Market Postpones Resumption of Business

The cotton yarn market is not planning to resume business in the short term. Since the lifting of price controls, prices of various commodities have been soaring. The bidding price of cotton yarn outside the market is particularly frantic, rising by hundreds at a time, creating a dangerous situation. If business were to resume abruptly, it would be difficult to manage. Therefore, it is planned to resume business only after commodity market conditions return to normal.

### Various Supply Routes Are Blocked; Food Rice Arrivals Are Scarce

Due to transportation blockades on various routes to Shanghai, the arrival of food rice is decreasing daily. Yesterday, a total of 244 shi (unit of dry measure) arrived at the two markets. Transactions in the market have not yet resumed. The price of white japonica rice in the North Market is 130 yuan.

Flour

There are no formal transactions. The market remains stalled. The asking price for miscellaneous brand No. 2 flour has exceeded 70 yuan, reaching 73 yuan. Wheat bran continues to rise madly. A large bag of bran costs 57 yuan, with the after-market asking price at 60 yuan. Miscellaneous Grains

Prices continue to rise. Very few soybeans are being offered. Pinghu medium coarse soybeans are at 132 yuan, a rise of about 20-30 yuan. Corn and red sorghum are being sought after by merchants from other provinces, each rising by 30%. Sesame seeds have risen sharply by 70-80 yuan, and raw kernels have also risen by 30%.

Cooking Oil

The market is at a standstill. Manufacturers and transporters are not supplying the market due to high costs. Retailers have no goods to sell. It is said that soybean oil is being quoted at 550 yuan and rapeseed oil at 500 yuan, each rising sharply by more than 200 yuan. Soybean cake has risen by another 13 yuan, with Profit brand cake trading at 62 yuan.

### Sugar Prices Rise

The sugar market yesterday was stable at first, then firm. Sentiment within the industry is trending upwards. Supply in the market is scarce, and asking prices are soaring. No. 45, 44-bag carloads of white sugar were initially quoted at 220 yuan. Later, hearing that various non-industry items continued to be popular, sentiment turned firm, and prices immediately soared to 235 yuan (cash). There is demand but no supply for No. 24 coarse sugar for the 26th period, and no asking price has been set. Holders are slightly unloading coarse and medium sugar, but the quantity is small. Market conditions are generally firm.

### Silk and Satin Trading Is Brisk

In the midst of the chaotic market conditions for various non-industry items, the supply of man-made silk in the market is extremely scarce, and sentiment is exceptionally firm. Asking prices are rising steadily. Silk weaving factories are frequently absorbing supply, and the number of chips in the market is exhausted, causing prices to soar in a straight line. The initial asking price for No. 120 Tianqiao silk was already high. Later, hearing that yarn and cloth were remarkably firm, no one was selling. Small factories have scarce raw materials in stock, and they buy as soon as they sell, pushing prices up by another 2,000-3,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

Yesterday, some merchants sold raw silk at high prices, so the supply was still abundant. Foreign firms are still taking a wait-and-see approach. Transactions among domestic merchants have increased. Superior grade, separate lot, spot goods for immediate delivery were traded at 15,000 yuan. Next week's futures were at 16,000 yuan, and D-grade was also traded at 17,000 yuan. There was a supply of Ji Li dried silk by merchants from other provinces, and the market also rose accordingly. Due to the soaring prices of raw materials, and under the attack of speculative capital, buying sentiment in the satin market has turned brisk, and sentiment is trending firm. The initial price for low-grade quilt covers was 6,500 yuan. Later, due to rumors, the masses grabbed and absorbed supply, and market conditions rose further, with the asking price rising by 2,000 yuan in an instant, pulling up all other prices in unison.

### Cotton Cloth Prices Soar Repeatedly

Retail Stores Unable to Resume Business; Cloth Market Prices Increase Due to the Temporary Suspension of Allocation by the Textile Construction Corporation. Dragon Head fine cloth was initially quoted at 310 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji reached an unprecedented high price of 330 yuan. Later, as credit conditions eased slightly, merchants from other provinces sold some of their holdings. Near noon, the price of Dragon Head fine cloth softened back to 280 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji to 300 yuan. Cloth shops are unable to resume business because the source of supply is still unresolved and are currently discussing countermeasures.

Tea Market Is Quiet

The quiet foreign tea market has still not recovered. Holders are unwilling to sell easily for various grades, while merchants are hesitant to buy because of high prices, resulting in little activity due to scarce selling and buying. As for domestic sales tea, although there is demand from merchants in Tianjin, transportation is blocked, so sales have also been stagnant for a long time. However, stores on this street, seeing that retail sales were crowded a week ago and that inventories are gradually running out, are planning to make a comeback. It is said that they are currently planning to ask sellers for samples to make purchases.

### Silver and Money Industry Revises Interest Rates

### Supply of Funds Increases; Credit Conditions Are More Flexible Than Before

Yesterday was the end of the week. Credit conditions in the market did not ease, but because a large amount of funds flowed south from North China, the supply of funds was relatively abundant. Underground interest rates were still being quoted at 6 jiao or more, reaching as high as 7.5 jiao, but general turnover was more flexible than before.

### Financial Situation Is Changing; Difficulty for Silver and Money Industry to Increase Capital

[Our Report] The capital increase issue for the silver and money industry in this city has recently encountered new difficulties due to changes in the economic and financial situation.

According to recent statistics, the total amount of deposits in the silver, money, and trust industries in this city is only 100 million gold yuan, while the total amount of funds required for the capital increase of the three industries is as high as 60 million yuan. However, a portion of the capital increase must be paid as deposit reserve, and a portion must be paid as clearing house reserve, and some must be retained as cashier's checks and cash reserves, making it impossible to turn around.

### "Hugging the Leg Doctrine" in Suiyuan

— Our Reporter Liu Yingguang

[Our Report from Guisui on the 20th] The Communist bandits' northern invasion of Chahar and Suiyuan this time is entirely coordinated with the autumn offensive inside and outside the Shanhaiguan Pass, with the Northeast as the axis. What they adopted toward Chahar and Suiyuan is the "hugging the leg doctrine," that is, to drag down Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi's two legs, not allowing him to enter the Liaoxi Corridor, and even attempting to have his two hands busy defending the Pingjin-Baoding triangle area. The Communist bandits used deceptive tactics from the very beginning.

He Long did visit Shuoxian twice before Nie Rongzhen invaded Suiyuan. On September 1, he arrogantly shouted the so-called slogan of "attacking Guisui," and on September 16, he issued three so-called "instructions": "obstructing the repair of the PingSui Railway, looting autumn harvests in Suiyuan, and opening up the international route to Outer Mongolia." At the same time, Yao Zhe's SuiMeng Military Region, FengLiang Brigade, and PianQing Detachment, and Kang Jianmin's mounted bandits, were mobilized in Zuoyun and Youyu, sealing off all passes of the Great Wall and cutting off the flow of people. It was not until late September that Nie Rongzhen began his northern invasion, and all sectors felt the gradual tightening of the situation.

Military and government personnel from Helin, Liangcheng, and Fengzhen led the local militia and took the initiative to withdraw from the county towns and went into the mountains to conduct guerrilla warfare. The garrison troops in Jining and Baotou were ordered to assemble in Guisui. If it were not for the local militia in southern and eastern Suiyuan restraining the enemy's flanks, the bandit army's cavalry could have reached the Guisui city walls on the night of the 24th. On the morning of the 25th, the Qingshuihe County government also withdrew automatically and confronted the bandit army in the northern mountains. In addition to the SuiMeng Military Region detouring to the south of Fushan Village, the "Second Column" advanced eastward towards Jining. The "Eighth Column" and Kang Jianmin's cavalry, crossing the Fengzhen County town, besieged the Quejing armored train and the Second Security Regiment stationed in Fengzhen near Hongshaba at dawn on the 25th, launching a fierce battle. Since then, most of eastern Suiyuan has been controlled by the bandits. After Deputy Commander-in-Chief Deng Baoshan and Feng Qinzhai flew to Baotou together, people's hearts were slightly stabilized. Guisui's defenses were consolidated, and the bandits did not dare to attack the city. The "Second and Eighth Columns" in eastern Suiyuan, however, seized the Jining county town during this period.

The Jining garrison had only the First Security Regiment and about 300 fully equipped cavalrymen left behind by E YouSan in the area, along with more than 700 unarmed infantrymen, and the rest were Jining's police and self-defense forces, with a fighting strength of less than 2,000 men. Wang Bingru, E YouSan's deputy brigade commander, stubbornly defended and refused to retreat. As a result, due to the delay of the armored train and the Second Security Regiment in Fengzhen in breaking through at Hongshaba, the isolated army in Jining held out for a day and a night, finally running out of ammunition and reinforcements.

The fall of Jining was greatly influenced by Fengzhen. Jining has a strategic position, but it is not as concentrated in wealth as Fengzhen in eastern Suiyuan. Fengzhen is three stations away from Datong and six stations away from Jining and has no natural defenses. It had fallen three times since the start of the suppression of the rebellion. The provincial government had long planned to evacuate the manpower and resources of Fengzhen and strengthen the defensive forces of Jining, but this was opposed by the local gentry. For example, the power plants in Fengzhen and Jining were destroyed. If the power plants in Fengzhen and Jining were merged, Jining could be equipped with a power grid. At dawn on the 30th, the National Army attacked Jining, and the "First, Second, and Eighth" Columns immediately moved towards Yanbei and southern Chahar. From then on, the threat west of Jining was temporarily reduced, and the center of the war shifted from Guisui to Zhangyuan.

Since October 8, the bandit army attacking Zhangyuan has been moving westward because our Jining reinforcement army attacked its flanks. The Sixth Column also made exploratory intrusions into Jining. The National Army laid bait near Xinghe in eastern Suiyuan and implemented a decisive battle to let the bandit army fall into the Dead Sea.

In recent years, Suiyuan's expenditures have been huge. The countryside has lost 60% of its able-bodied men, and the grain is only enough for seeds. Most of the people live on miscellaneous grains, sweet potatoes, and vegetables. The livestock in the Mongolian banners are also decreasing day by day. According to the reporter's observations in Guisui from many aspects, I deeply feel that today's Suiyuan is no longer a money-making tree or a treasure bowl.
