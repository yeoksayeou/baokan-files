### Balancing International Payments by Conserving Foreign Exchange: Import Tariffs to Be Re-Evaluated; Warehouse Inspections to Begin in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Chongqing; Central Bank to Further Restrict Lending Scope

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Following currency reform, the government, in order to balance international payments, will continue to strive to conserve the use of foreign exchange. To this end, the following measures will be taken: (1) Inspecting passports to recall officials, idle sons of wealthy families, and students who have completed their studies and are staying abroad without official duties. (2) Reducing unnecessary diplomatic personnel stationed abroad and strictly limiting central and local government agencies from arbitrarily sending personnel abroad for inspections. (3) No longer sending personnel to international conferences unrelated to major national interests. (4) Ceasing the procurement of goods from abroad that are already available through U.S. aid. (5) Revising and reducing the items on the import list, prohibiting the import of items unrelated to production.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] Warehouse inspection work will begin in the six cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Qingdao, and Chongqing. In areas not designated for warehouse inspections, the quantity of materials stored by companies and merchants should also be reported to the local government on a monthly basis. When necessary, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce may authorize the local government to conduct temporary inspections. Companies and merchants found to be hoarding will be punished, with the most serious cases resulting in confiscation of goods. Less serious cases will be subject to fines or criminal penalties. However, a warning stage will be implemented before enforcement. These measures are included in the supplementary implementation measures for combating hoarding and speculation drafted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which will be implemented after approval by the Executive Yuan.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] In order to cooperate with the implementation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Stabilization, the Joint Treasury will comprehensively review its past lending policies. The Board of Directors of the Joint Treasury is scheduled to hold its first meeting since the currency reform on the morning of the 28th to discuss lending policies. The question of whether to resume lending, which has been suspended for a week, will also be discussed. The meeting will be personally chaired by President Weng, and the heads of various banks and bureaus in Shanghai will come to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 28th to participate. In the past, the Joint Treasury's loans relied on issuance, but the issuance of Gold Yuan Certificates will be limited in the future, so lending must in fact continue to be tightened to cooperate with the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Stabilization. At the same time, in view of the criticisms from all sides regarding the loans of national banks, it is widely believed that the scope of lending and the standards for review will be stricter than in the past.

### President Weng Cables Zhang Lisheng: Exert All Efforts to Stabilize Prices; Zhang Emphasizes Austerity Should Begin with High-Ranking Officials at Press Conference Hosted by Beiping Municipal Government Yesterday

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] President Weng cabled Zhang Lisheng in Beiping on the 27th, stating that all efforts must be made to stabilize prices. Zhang met with reporters at the municipal government at 10:00 a.m. on the 27th, requesting that the press, regardless of any differences in opinions or positions on specific issues, must be aligned with the government on the major policy of financial reform. He then answered reporters' questions: (1) The supply of materials will not be a problem in the future. In addition to U.S. aid materials such as grain, cotton, and fertilizer, the government has surplus materials purchased in Beiping, such as automobile parts, worth about 200 million US dollars. If there is a shortage of food in Beiping and Tianjin, the government will provide overall solutions. (2) New public bonds must be issued after the currency reform. (3) In addition to the 2 billion Gold Yuan, there will be subsidiary currency to supplement the shortage of small denominations. Before the war, the issuance of subsidiary currency was about 350 million, and if 500 million is issued this time, the market will definitely not feel a shortage. (This answer was provided by Wang Fuzhou.) (4) The issuance of Northeast Circulation Certificates accounted for one-fourth of the national issuance, which was three months ago. Now it accounts for only about one-twentieth. The solution to the problem of foreign exchange conversion between the interior and exterior is under study. Finally, a reporter asked if the ban on publishing black market prices was akin to burying one's head in the sand. Zhang said: "There is the act of burying one's head, which is to avoid stimulating the psychological morbidity of the people, but there is no act of stealing the bell." The government must show credibility to the people this time and earnestly solve the problem. Zhang also emphasized that in order for the financial and economic reforms to succeed, the Chinese people should pay attention to thrift. He spoke at length about how high-ranking government officials should take the lead and praised the British. He said: "Thrift should begin with oneself. For example, high-ranking officials should first refuse the pompous welcomes and send-offs and banquets. He practices this himself on weekdays and refused to have the municipal government prepare refreshments for the reporters.

[Another Dispatch] Zhang Lisheng is scheduled to go to Tianjin with Wang Fuzhou on the 28th. Xia Jinxiong went to Tianjin on the afternoon of the 26th.

### Minister Peng Discusses

Elucidating the Prohibition of Black Market Prices

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Minister of Interior Peng Zhaoxian recently made a statement regarding the ban on newspapers and publications from reporting black market prices after the implementation of the new currency, as follows: (1) The most important items for which newspapers and publications are prohibited from publishing black market prices are gold, silver, foreign exchange, and essential goods for people's livelihood. (2) The types of essential daily necessities are based on the "Revised Implementation Notes for the Measures for Combating Hoarding and Speculation of Essential Daily Necessities During Extraordinary Times," which are: A. Foodstuffs: Cereals (rice, wheat or flour), salt, sugar, cooking oil (rapeseed oil, soybean oil, peanut oil or sesame oil). B. Clothing: Cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth (various undyed cotton cloth, various bleached, dyed or printed cotton cloth). C. Fuels: Coal, charcoal (coal lumps, coal fines, coal briquettes, charcoal), wood charcoal, etc., should be reported strictly in accordance with the legal limited prices and approved negotiated prices. (3) The so-called black market refers to goods whose new prices exceed the prices on August 19, as stipulated in Article 13 of the "Measures for Rectifying Finances and Strengthening Economic Control," and the negotiated prices approved by the government in the future, as well as the gold, silver, and foreign currency of the people that are not traded at legal prices as stipulated in Article 11 of the "Measures for Handling Foreign Exchange and Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People."

### Legal Profit for Gold Shops

The three main revisions are: (1) The old measures stipulated that gold bars and gold ingots could be exchanged for gold ornaments. The new measures stipulate that gold bars and gold ingots may not be exchanged. (2) The old measures stipulated that the limit for people to own gold ornaments was two taels. The new measures remove the limit of two taels. The legal profit for gold shops is set at five percent.

### Xikang-Tibet Highway Reaches Yunnan Border

Central Government Orders Relevant Authorities to Stop It

[Our Kunming Dispatch, 27th] The Tibetan government has recently started construction of a highway from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, to the A'dazi area of Weixi County on the Yunnan border under the pretext of developing transportation and trade between Yunnan and Tibet. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Interior are unsure of the true intentions of the Tibetan government and have ordered the relevant authorities to pay close attention and stop it first.

### The President Personally Presides Over the Confucius Birthday Memorial Service; President Yu Reports on the Doctrines and Thoughts of Confucius; For World Peace, We Must Shoulder the Great Task of Continuing the Past and Opening the Future

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] This morning at 10 o'clock, the Presidential Palace held a Confucius Birthday Memorial Service. President Chiang personally presided over the ceremony. Vice President Li, along with the heads of various ministries and departments, and senior officials, were all in attendance. Also present were Yu Youren, He Yingqin, Wang Yunwu, Zhu Jiahua, Lin Yunkai, Lei Zhen, Tian Jiongjin, Hang Liwu, Qin Dechun, Gui Yongqing, and over four hundred others. On the stage, the portrait of the Most Sage and Foremost Teacher was placed. After President Chiang led the attendees in paying respects, President Yu Youren gave a report on the life of Confucius and his doctrines and thoughts, which lasted twenty minutes. The full text of Yu's report is recorded below:

This year marks the two thousand four hundred and ninety-ninth year since the birth of Confucius. Today is the first Confucius Birthday Memorial Service held by the central government after the implementation of the Constitution of the Republic of China, and it is also National Teachers' Day, celebrated throughout the country. I am honored to deliver a respectful address at this solemn ceremony in the Presidential Palace.

I recall that last year, when I gave a report at the National Government, I said: "For thousands of years, our country and nation have been immersed in the thoughts and teachings of Confucius. To this day, it is the only country with a long history in the world, and his doctrines and thoughts are still being pursued and realized by our entire nation. Although Confucius was born for the sake of the world, not just for China, there are many discussions and expositions by scholars from both China and abroad regarding Confucius's era, his economic thoughts, and his methods of governing and administering, which I will not elaborate on for the time being. Now that we have stepped from the stage of political tutelage into the gate of constitutionalism, for the sake of China's constitutionalism, for the sake of world peace, we must shoulder this great task of continuing the past and opening the future. How can we clearly recognize our historical mission and the new trend of all mankind? The specific answer must be extracted from the surviving scriptures of Confucius."

The Founding Father Inherited the Thoughts of Confucius; This Is How the Three Principles of the People Arose

The surviving scriptures of Confucius have been transmitted, annotated, and studied by countless Confucian scholars of the Han and Song dynasties. Few have fully explored the vast and profound source of his thought. Emperors of past dynasties revered Confucius, mostly taking what benefited them and discarding what did not, the fault of which does not lie with Confucius. Great scholars emerged in the Ming Dynasty, extracting great principles from the abandoned scriptures, creating a social spirit of resistance, and ushering in an era of the expansion of human rights. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father, rose up in response to the times. His scholarship, viewed horizontally, is a collection of the great achievements of the world's ancient sages. Viewed from a true perspective, it undoubtedly inherited the traditional thoughts since Confucius, and in response to the needs of the times, he formulated a plan to save the world, an unprecedented creation in history. This is how the Three Principles of the People arose, how the Republic of China was established, and how the Chinese nation was transformed into a new life. The ancient and modern sages are truly united on the heart-source of equality and freedom.

When the Republic of China was founded in 1912, the Presidential Palace was connected to the current Presidential Palace. The Founding Father, as an ordinary citizen, created the Republic of China, became the head of state, and overthrew the monarchy that had lasted for thousands of years. Amid the cheers of the masses, everyone wanted to see him. If they could obtain a piece of paper with a few words, they would be overjoyed. Although the Founding Father was extremely busy during his tenure as president, he rarely refused requests for calligraphy. Whether it was long paper, short paper, white paper, or red paper, he always happily wrote the four characters "Tian Xia Wei Gong" (The World Belongs to All), and sometimes wrote the two characters "Bo Ai" (Universal Love), in return for the people's respect for him. It was nothing more than a concrete indication of his inner cultivation and fervent hope, as if proclaiming to people that only a world of public good, a world of love, was the world he dreamed of and longed for. If it was a world that was neither public nor loving, then he would only have to develop his grand aspirations, devote all his efforts to reform and save it, and use his own vitality and the common aspirations of the people to create a new life for humanity. "Public Good" and "Love" are indeed the rational living境界 of human society that the Founding Father sought day and night. This little story is well worth recalling. Because we recall the breadth of Confucius's doctrines, and even more so the source of the people's livelihood and politics, when we enter the gate of the Presidential Palace, we see the horizontal plaque with the four characters "Tian Xia Wei Gong" hanging high above, written by the Founding Father and enlarged. For more than two thousand years, Confucius's political thought has been magnified and has become our national creed, the root of our great constitution. The Founding Father's political propositions have also been magnified from theory into a great reality, from governing a country to saving all of humanity, and from small words to a goal that I strive for. When we think of the Founding Father's instructions, we are constantly reminded of the magnifying radiation of the thoughts and words of great philosophers and sages, which is truly enough to illuminate the past and present, filling the sky and the earth. Great is Confucius!

Everyone Can Be a Teacher for All Ages; Achieve the Goal of a World of Public Good

Regarding the correct interpretation of the Great Harmony, Kong Yingda explained the two characters "Da Tong" (Great Harmony) as "the entire land is like this." Zheng Kangcheng annotated the two characters "Da Tong" as "like harmony, like peace." Translated, it means that people respect peace. Therefore, living more than two thousand years after Confucius, we should see this clearly. Anyone who uses power or conspiracy to harm human peace, threaten human survival, or destroy human happiness is an enemy of mankind, and the result will certainly be self-defeating. As for the "Gong" (Public Good) in "Tian Xia Wei Gong" (The World Belongs to All), "Gong Zhe Gong Ye" (Public is Shared). Xu Shen's "Shuo Wen Jie Zi" (Explaining Simple and Compound Characters) explains the character "Gong" as "Bei Si Wei Gong" (Turning Away from Selfishness for the Public Good). Public is the opposite of private. Heaven covers without selfishness, earth supports without selfishness, the sun and moon shine without selfishness. Without selfishness, there is ultimate public good. When extended to the world, there is nothing that is not public. Zheng's annotation means shared and cooperative. Xu believes that public is the reverse writing of private. Xu's statement can mutually illuminate Zheng's annotation, establishing the definitive meaning of the character Public in Tian Xia Wei Gong. I say that the Great Harmony Chapter always likes to quote Zheng's annotations, not because Confucius's spirit is limited to this, but because I deeply feel the excellence of the insights of the predecessors, and the failure of later generations to inherit and carry them forward, hence the stagnation of Eastern evolution.

In the past, I proposed Confucius's phrase "You Jiao Wu Lei" (Education for All) to teachers, saying that this phrase contains the educators' own grand aspirations and great power, and further indicates the sacred responsibility of teachers. It can encourage countless educated young people to pursue further studies, while Confucius's own "Xue Bu Yan, Jiao Bu Juan" (Learning Without Satiety, Teaching Without Weariness), the greatest and most diligent, the most humble and cultivated state of mind, serves as a model for teachers and scholars for thousands of years. Zhu Xi's annotation of the character "Lei" (Category) in "You Jiao Wu Lei" only extends to the distinction between the moral categories of human beings' habits of good and evil, which is relatively narrow in today's view. For example, differences in religious beliefs, differences in race, differences in wealth and poverty, differences in regional access, differences in innate intelligence, and even differences between the healthy and the disabled, differences in age and gender; despite the differences, there should be sameness, that is, they should all receive education, all be a perfect person like Confucius who learns without satiety and teaches without weariness. Everyone has the right to be educated and the obligation to teach. Not only should there be equality before the law, but there should also be equality in education. Equal opportunities for teaching and learning are a rational life for the people, and can step into the glorious, true, good, and beautiful world of Great Harmony. In such a difficult era, I commemorate Confucius, thank and bless the teachers of the whole country. You are determined to stand on your own work posts, overcome all the poverty and pain of material life, and fulfill the sacred responsibility for the next generation and even thousands of generations, and do your best. And encourage the young people who are studying, ask more questions and learn more, and strive to build the country, sincerely accept the most valuable instructions left to us by Confucius and the Founding Father, and go to practice them in person. Mencius said, "Everyone can become Yao and Shun." We want to say, "Everyone can be a teacher for all ages." We hang up the greatest goal, we must promote the complete realization of the Three Principles of the People, so as to achieve a world of freedom and equality, a world of love, a world of public good, and a world of peace and happiness.

Acquisition of Sino-Foreign Agricultural and Commercial Shares

Joint Discussion by the Legislative Yuan's Financial and Economic and Legal Systems Committees; Decision to Hold Another Meeting to Study Technical Issues

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Legislative Yuan's Financial and Economic Committee and the Legal Systems Committee held a joint symposium at 10 a.m. on the 27th to discuss the proposal submitted by Wang Lihang and others, which was entrusted to them by the General Assembly for review: In order to complete the national banking system, please acquire the commercial shares of the Sino-, Foreign-, and Agricultural banks, and propose to amend the organizational regulations of the Central Bank. First, Chairman Zhang Jing and Committee Member Xu Zhong reported on the preliminary review conducted by the group, followed by a heated discussion. The members of the committee unanimously agreed on the acquisition of commercial shares in national banks, but had many suggestions regarding the procedure for carrying out this task. Liu Zhendong, Liu Butong, Cui Jingbai, and others strongly criticized the minority who, lacking any basis, manipulated the national banks with special powers, resulting in fragmented operations, and the expansion of political power into the division of spoils among banks, and various other abnormal phenomena caused by institutional principles. In addition, the committee members also raised many points that should be noted regarding the fact that some commercial shares have shares without rights, and the undemocratic organization of the board of directors and supervisors. Finally, many technical issues need to be studied in detail, and it was decided to hold another meeting to discuss the matter on a regular basis. During the meeting, Committee Member Liu Butong commented on the unjust distribution of equity: Before the war, Mo Dehui's investment in the Bank of China was 50,000 silver dollars, while Mei Wanhua's share capital was 400,000 silver dollars, making him the largest commercial shareholder, but Mo Dehui obtained the qualification of director and has held it to this day, while Mei Wanhua has always had shares without rights. Such unequal treatment of commercial shares by national banks is unreasonable.

Editorial

### The Alertness That Should Be Present When Money Supply Is Loose and Excessive

Recently, the money supply has been unusually loose and excessive. The daily interest rate has fallen to two or three yuan, and it is still difficult to lend it out. It is said that this situation is only seen since 1939. The main reasons are nothing more than the following: (1) There is a great deal of eagerness to exchange gold, silver, and foreign currencies; (2) The government is striving to maintain price limits and crack down on hoarding, thus greatly reducing speculation; (3) The people have great confidence in the new currency, reversing their stockpiling of goods; (4) The stock exchange has not yet reopened, and short-term treasury bonds have also been suspended, reducing the channels for idle funds to flow into; (5) National banks have been withdrawing a lot of money in recent days; (6) It is said that a considerable amount of remittances from the interior have been flowing into Shanghai.

According to normal theory, a loose money supply and low interest rates are not necessarily bad phenomena, and are precisely the goals that the interest rate restriction measures of banks and businesses are intended to achieve. If the above-mentioned restriction measures can be advanced on schedule and maintained for a long time, then costs will be low and prices will naturally fall. And with easier allocation and lighter burdens, industry and commerce can be expected to gradually recover. It is said that the pawnshop industry, which has been troubled by high interest rates and stalled, is also partially revitalizing and resuming business, which shows that low interest rates are beneficial to legitimate industry and commerce.

However, from the opposite perspective, the situation is also quite concerning. Because idle funds are rampant, even if precautions are taken effectively and have not yet reached the stage of causing trouble, the longer the stagnation, the thicker the potential. If there is no active and legitimate outlet to divert them, once the defenses collapse and the banks are breached, it will ultimately pose a great threat to prices. In the past, in controlling prices and cracking down on hoarding, local officials also put in a great deal of effort, but prices continued to surge, with no falls, and the main reason was this.

A detailed explanation of the various measures stipulated in the emergency decree has also provided many directions on how to divert idle funds, such as stepping up tax collection, restoring pre-war tax rates, temporarily suspending lending, selling surplus and enemy/puppet materials, raising the capital of banks and businesses, planning to issue gold yuan bonds, setting a deadline for the withdrawal of legal tender, and issuing shares of China Textile Corporation and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, etc. If these many measures can be advanced in parallel and implemented quickly without missing the opportunity, we believe that the vast majority of idle funds will indeed have a suitable destination. The problem is that many measures may not be able to be implemented quickly due to procedural, technical, or temporal constraints. And the relevant competent authorities often have too many concerns and considerations, so that they cannot cooperate with the Central Bank's exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currencies. For example, the issuance of new bonds is still awaiting the consolidation of old debts and the completion of legislative procedures. And raising the capital of banks and businesses has also been pointed out by people in the industry as having many issues that need to be resolved. Therefore, in order to cope with the current situation and prevent problems before they arise, we can only advance and implement the feasible paths as soon as possible to reduce the amount of idle funds in the market.

Among them, the easiest to implement and the most effective is undoubtedly the large-scale sale of materials. The Shanghai Economic Supervision Conference has already resolved that China Textile Corporation and the Central Bank should sell yarn and cloth within the price limits, which is originally a matter of course and should have been done in coordination. But in fact, what materials can be sold are not limited to yarn and cloth? And the institutions that control materials are not limited to China Textile Corporation and the Central Bank? Other various US aid materials have been arriving at the port one after another, and the number that can be allocated and sold is even more considerable. Why haven't the relevant agencies taken responsibility for negotiating and quickly selling them? As for the funds that have been recovered after the sale of US aid materials, unless absolutely necessary, they should be temporarily stored in the treasury and not issued again, in order to tighten the money supply. Especially the legal tender portion should be handled according to the principle of setting a deadline for withdrawal, preferably shortening the deadline, allowing only inflows and no outflows, in order to contract the circulation of currency. If this is done, not only will idle funds have a destination and will not find other outlets, causing other adverse effects, but also with ample supply, prices will naturally return to a stable level, without having to rely solely on the police and courts.

The authorities have repeatedly implemented measures to tighten the money supply, and there are precedents. Sometimes it is suddenly tight and suddenly loose, with excessive fluctuations, which has indeed caused a lot of pain to the industry and commerce sector. However, in this time of strictly enforcing price limits and consolidating the currency system, such artificial measures are indeed necessary in fact. Because there is too much idle money, it is inevitable that prices will be stirred up, and if prices cannot be stabilized, it will inevitably affect the entire currency system. If the new currency is hit again because of this, the country and the people will suffer endless harm. In order to ensure the stability of the currency system and the economy, we have to earnestly request the authorities to take immediate and effective measures to address the issue of loose and excessive money supply.

As for the other planned measures, due to factual difficulties, they may require careful consideration or meticulous preparation, and there is room for measuring the pros and cons and urgency. But in order to achieve the stability of prices and currency value, we must find ways to regulate the excess currency. Moreover, the original materials are sometimes exhausted, and when purchasing and ordering to replenish them, funds must be released to facilitate purchasing. Therefore, the sale of materials can only be said to be a temporary emergency measure. At the same time, the situation should be carefully assessed and various measures should be taken separately to guide idle funds into the right track.

### Investigation Report on the July 5th Incident (1)

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The Control Yuan recently released the investigation report on the July 5th Incident by Commissioners Gu Fengxiang and Hu Wenhui. The full text is as follows:

Having been appointed to investigate the July 5th Incident, we immediately went to Beiping, collected materials from all parties, questioned relevant personnel present, interviewed Chinese and foreign people in Dongjiaominxiang at that time, and went to the scene for on-site investigation. Now that the investigation has been completed, we hereby list the causes of the incident, the course of events, and the responsibilities for the incident, based on relevant materials from all parties, analyzed and organized, as follows:

On July 5th, because of the petition of students from the Northeast and the encirclement of the residence of Xu Huidong, Speaker of the Beiping Municipal Council, soldiers were ordered to suppress them and opened fire, killing and wounding many students. The course of events is described in detail as follows:

Reasons for the Petition

(1) Reasons for the petition: Since the withdrawal from Yongji in the Northeast, Chang Pan was isolated, and food prices were surprisingly high. The lives of ordinary people felt difficult, and they entered the customs one after another. The students gathered in Beiping grew in number. After the Ministry of Education announced the establishment of Northeast Provisional University and Provisional Middle School in Beiping and Tianjin, college and middle school students flocked to them. Due to lack of preparation, food and lodging became a problem. They lived scattered in temples and park corridors, and some even lived in the holes in the city walls. Their state of displacement was pitiful. At this time, at the third meeting of the Beiping Municipal Council, Councilor Ding Tuojin and others proposed the "Emergency Measures for Relieving Students from the Northeast Coming to Beiping," the content of which was roughly divided into three points: (1) All students must receive military training. Those with good academic standing and ideology will be assigned to various universities for continued studies after training. Those with bad ideology will be subjected to management and training. Those who do not meet the academic requirements will be assigned to the army for enlistment. (2) Stop issuing funds to Northeast National Schools and transfer them to Commander-in-Chief Chuan for issuance, or change them to Northeast Provisional University as funding, and close all Northeast schools uniformly. (3) Northeast teachers and staff will work in the student military training class or Provisional University at their original salaries (Beiping Tianjin Index). The proposal was passed by the General Assembly (see Attachment No. 7 for the original text) and published in various newspapers on July 4th. The students from the Northeast were greatly shocked and their emotions were high. That night, they convened a joint meeting of major universities and middle schools in the Northeast. The next day (5th), they marched and demanded that the Municipal Council withdraw the proposal and apologize to the students from the Northeast. (To be continued)

### Three Envoys Meet with Molotov; Negotiations Approaching Final Stage; Four Powers to Issue Joint Communiqué Soon

[Reported by this newspaper] London, 27th (radio Moscow) The envoys of the United Kingdom, the United States and France went to the Kremlin on the 27th from their respective embassies to have a research meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. It rained all day in Moscow, and the three envoys appeared to be in good spirits. According to official announcements, Stalin will not attend the meeting. According to relevant sources, the four powers may issue a brief joint communiqué on the night of the 28th. This communiqué may not elaborate much on the issues that have already been discussed behind the scenes at the Kremlin.

[United Press, Moscow, 27th] The three Western envoys went to the Kremlin again at 2 p.m. on the 27th to discuss the Berlin crisis and the future of Germany. Before meeting with Molotov, the three envoys had a brief discussion of today's agenda and prepared to jointly discuss the report to be submitted to their respective governments at the British Embassy after the meeting. During this meeting, the head of the Second Western Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Smirnov, will definitely be on hand to assist. If Stalin does not attend on the evening of the 27th, there may be at least one more East-West meeting afterwards.

[French News Agency, London, 26th] However, according to reliable sources, news from Berlin said that negotiations have now reached the final stage. After the agreement is signed, the four-power government will issue a joint instruction to the four-power occupying forces in Berlin to implement the following two points: (1) Cancel the Berlin blockade, to be implemented by both sides; (2) A single currency, East Mark, will be in circulation in Berlin, with guarantees given to the West. The general opinion here is that the agreement thus concluded clearly only involves the Berlin issue, but this is certainly sufficient to open the way to the point where the four countries discuss general issues. The opportunity to form a larger-scale agreement will depend on how safe and secure the implementation of the Berlin agreement is.

### Berlin City Council Harassed Again; Adjourns Indefinitely; Non-Communist German Parties Hold Counter-Demonstration

[French News Agency, Berlin, 27th] Berlin Deputy Mayor Fiedensburg confirmed at a press conference yesterday that the Communist delegation had requested the City Council to hand over power to an emergency committee to negotiate with the Soviet side, but the City Council authorities had refused and firmly stated that they would stick to their positions.

[French News Agency, Berlin, 27th] Another large-scale Communist demonstration took place in front of the Berlin City Council office this morning. Several hundred Communists broke through the iron gates and rushed into the City Hall, demanding that the elected Senate resign. Demonstrators appeared in front of the City Hall in groups of three or five as early as this morning, waving red flags and carrying Communist slogans. Two hours later, the number of demonstrators had reached several thousand, several hundred of whom, with the help of Communist city senators, managed to enter the City Hall. At this time, the City Council was formally considering whether to summon the fire brigade to disperse the crowd. Several City Hall employees attempted to prevent the demonstrators from entering the City Hall, but failed.

Some demonstrators waved red flags and shouted slogans such as "The City Council belongs to the people" and "We must firmly abandon any illusions about the City Council," attempting to enter the meeting room where the meeting was being held and occupy the seats of the city senators. Senator Li Shike of the Socialist Unity Party jumped onto the podium and announced, "This is the time to take action." Schliem, chairman of the Berlin Soviet Zone Trade Union, continued to speak, saying, "Workers should wake up and take direct action to break through all forces that resist us." Seeing this situation, Speaker Suer announced to the assembly that the City Council would be adjourned indefinitely due to the lack of police protection. The demonstrators then shouted and withdrew from the City Hall and headed to the city center.

[United Press, Berlin, 26th] As the Communists surrounded City Hall this afternoon, three anti-Communist parties in Berlin held a counter-demonstration, calling for opposition to Communist "terror and violence," winning cheers from 15,000 German citizens.

### Dulles Returns to the U.S.; Believes the European Situation is Tending to Ease

[French News Agency, New York, 27th] Republican foreign policy advisor Dulles, who had just returned from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on the afternoon of the 26th after attending the New Education World Congress, told the press when he got off the plane, "I have returned from a trip to Europe and do not think there is an impression that a war will break out immediately." Dulles announced that before he left London to return to New York, he had discussed the Moscow negotiations with the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Douglas, but he declined to disclose the contents of their meeting. He only said, "I believe the situation is more relaxed than it was before I left the U.S. for Europe last Saturday. It is reported that Dulles will go to Paris again in two weeks to attend the United Nations General Assembly."

### U.S. Republican Party Revives Far East Plan; China to be the Focus; Economic Cooperation Administration Takes Over Aid to Korea Plan

[United Press, Washington, 26th] Several foreign policy experts in the U.S. Congress's Republican Party believe that after the Republican Party comes to power, the focus of U.S. foreign policy will shift from Europe to the Far East. They believe that if Dewey is elected president, he and his chief foreign policy advisor, Dulles, will ask Congress to pass a Far East Reconstruction Plan that is in principle broadly similar to the European Marshall Plan.

As far as is known, there is currently no Far East Reconstruction Plan. There are differing views, even among the most enthusiastic legislators, on how the scope of the plan should be. However, it is generally agreed that the political and economic reconstruction of China should be the main focus of the plan. According to estimates at one time, the plan would require $5 billion to $6 billion over three years, but these observers now believe that more funds will be used. Congressman Voorhis, one of the most prestigious members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, advocates a comprehensive Far East Reconstruction Plan that includes China, Japan, Korea, India, and the Southeast Asian colonies where the Communist Party is currently active. Voorhis believes that the U.S.-funded reconstruction plan must avoid the "collapse of the colonial system" in Malaya, French Vietnam, and the Dutch islands. However, Congressman Judd, who studied the Far East for more than ten years before entering Congress, believes that the focus should be on the reconstruction of China. He said: "The stability of China and the restoration of its historical borders will be the basis for maintaining peace in the Far East. As for the colonial regions of Britain, France, and the Netherlands, it would be better to provide assistance through the current European reconstruction plan." Voorhis made it clear that the Asian reconstruction issue will be raised in the next Congress.

[United Press, Washington, 26th] President Truman said on the 26th that he had ordered the administrator of the Economic Cooperation Administration, Hoffman, to prepare to take over the task of the U.S. economic aid plan in Korea within a few months. This decision comes on the heels of the recent U.S. cancellation of the U.S. military government in South Korea.

### Former Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Nishio Acquitted

The reason given was that the 500,000 yen handed over to Nishio by a civil engineering and construction contractor was given to Nishio personally, with the intention of suppressing the covert activities of the left wing of the Socialist Party and supporting the activities of Nishio, a right-wing stronghold. The Tokyo Public Prosecutor's Office expressed dissatisfaction with this acquittal.

### United States Strengthens Far East Air Force; Upgrades Major Air Bases in Japan, the Philippines, and Guam; Air Force Strength to Triple in the Future

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The U.S. Far East Air Force has upgraded its major bases in Japan, Guam, and the Philippines in order to increase the strength of the U.S. Far East Air Force. According to an official statement, the reorganization of the Far East Air Force bases will strengthen the control and operational capabilities of the U.S. Air Force stationed in the Far East. Prior to the reorganization, the major air bases in Japan, Guam, and the Philippines were commanded by air groups. The new plan stipulates that air wings (including three groups) will be responsible. It seems that the strength of the Far East Air Force will be tripled compared to before. However, officials did not say whether air wings would be stationed at various air force bases in the Far East. The new plan has been implemented at U.S. bases, with the air wing commander responsible for commanding one combat group, one supply and replenishment team, a sending team, and an air base. Previously, an air base only had one combat group and one air crew stationed there. The statement said: The new plan will allow an air wing to centrally control an air base, thereby strengthening the organization of the U.S. Far East Air Force.

### Authorities Detain Professional Students; 61 Confined to Special Criminal Court; Total Number Around 200; Key Figures Mostly Evaded Capture; Includes Son of Deputy Director Li of the Education Bureau

[Report from our newspaper] The city authorities' operation to arrest professional students from various schools began yesterday morning. Arrest warrants and summons were issued by the Special Criminal Court, with the assistance of the Garrison Headquarters and the Police Bureau. The charges listed on the arrest warrants were "suspicion of being communist bandits," and the summonses stated "endangering the state," but the summonses also indicated that the person summoned should bring the case file with them. When executing the arrests at schools, the personnel coordinated with the school authorities; at residences, they coordinated with the Baojia chiefs for searches and arrests. It is understood that the group of professional students numbers around 200, spread throughout various schools in the city. Yesterday, 61 were captured (a complete list will be published today), all of whom are being detained by the Special Criminal Court for detailed interrogation. The key figures at Jiaotong University have mostly gone into hiding; only one was apprehended. The authorities hope that the professional students will surrender themselves within the next few days, offering them a final chance for self-renewal.

Jiaotong University Dormitories Encircled and Searched: At Jiaotong University, military and police personnel entered and surrounded the student dormitories at 4:00 AM yesterday. They presented the school authorities with a list of 35 students to be detained or summoned. Those detained included Ma Zhaopu, Zhang Haiwei, Ge Ruliang, Huang Pengjiu, Zhang Feiran, Wu Zhendong, Liu Guangyu, Zhou Weiyun, Dai Chongzhao, Cai Zuqi, Li Junliang, Shi Jitao, Gan Weiyuan, You Dayu, Qian Shuwen, and Zhu Kuangshi. Those summoned included Li Yuting, Li Wenjie, Xing Youqing, Li Baozhen, Jiao Huamin, Zhou Guixiang, Wang Deming, Wu Qi, Cong Xinquan, Xi Shigang, Lin Jiaheng, Zhou Shiyan, Huang Shiqun, Ding Qizhong, He Ruoping, Wang Tingyu, Chen Hongyi, and Zhou Tongzhao and Li Jiahao. Most were members of the student union or departmental representatives. The school dispatched instructors to accompany the personnel inside for the search and arrest. Only Chen Hongyi was found; the others were not on campus. Military and police personnel also reported that two rooms in the dormitories were equipped with secret radio stations. The school sent personnel to inspect each room, but no radio stations were found. Only some old publications were confiscated and taken away.

Wang Zhizhuo, the acting president of the university, told reporters: "The government is acting according to the law, and the school cannot protect illegal elements. If there is resistance, the school cannot provide protection." The school will issue a notice ordering students who have been summoned but not yet captured to surrender themselves; otherwise, it will affect the school. The school has assured the authorities that these students are not on campus and hopes that classmates will report any who secretly return to the school. At the same time, the school urges students not on the list to remain calm and avoid disturbing each other. Acting President Wang also hopes that the authorities will not wrongly accuse anyone during this detention and that if there is insufficient evidence, the school will try to assist in requesting bail or release.

Chen Hongyi, who was arrested, was a departmental representative and a recent graduate. The school had hired him as an assistant teacher in the physics department. Among the 35 people, Zhou Tongzhao and Li Jiahao are not dormitory residents. Li is the son of Li Ximou, the acting director of the Municipal Education Bureau and an executive member of the student union. Military and police personnel went to Director Li's residences on Gubal Road and Gao'an Road the night before, but failed to apprehend him.

Fudan Students; Six Taken Away: At Fudan University, around 4:00 AM yesterday, Section Chief Zhang of the Police Headquarters and Chief Wang of the Xinshi Street Branch brought arrest warrants and summons from the Special Criminal Court to detain 34 students. They entered the dormitories accompanied by the dormitory administrator, and took away Liu Zongjun, Huang Guangchao, Yuan Duisong, Zhao Zihan, and Ding Wenwei. The other 29 were not on campus. Among the five who were taken away, some had summons instead of arrest warrants. President Zhang Yi believed that a summons did not authorize detention, and that the school could send personnel to accompany them to the court for questioning. However, the executing personnel pointed out that the summons indicated "bring the case file with you," so they were taken away.

Parents Notified; Guarantors Informed: Afterwards, the school immediately sent telegrams to the parents of the five detained students (all five were from other provinces) and notified their guarantors. The school also sent personnel to the Special Criminal Court to request prompt interrogation and, if there were no major criminal charges, to request their release or bail. In addition, a student named Shi Zongren at the school was arrested in the hospital.

President Zhang told reporters that the Special Criminal Court has the legal authority to detain and interrogate students with summons, and the school cannot refuse. However, the school is willing to guarantee students whose crimes are not serious if the Special Criminal Court allows them to be released on bail. The school has not yet considered how to handle the remaining 29 students who were summoned but not captured.

Guanghua Holds School Administration Meeting: It is understood that a total of four students at Guanghua University were to be detained or summoned. Yesterday morning, Zhang Peihang was arrested at the school. The school also received a report from a parent that another student, Xu Zhuping, had been arrested at home. The school held a special school administration meeting yesterday to discuss this. According to Vice President Liao Maoru, President Zhu Jingnong will visit Mayor Wu to inquire about the criminal charges against the detained students. If the evidence is insufficient, the school will try to bail them out.

In addition, nine students from Tongji University were detained: Tao Dingguo, Liu Guangshuo, Gu Ze, Yu Shu, Wu Bao, Chen Shijie, Jin Birong, Peng Shaowu, and Sha Cheng. At Datong University, the summons listed a total of eight students (five day students and three dormitory students). Only Xu Xingmin (female) was captured at the school. Another female student, Yao Fangfan, who had been expelled by the school last semester for changing to National Sports, was arrested at her residence in the morning.

### At This Time and Place, Someone Actually Dared to Test the Law; Large-Scale Gold and Currency Trading Cracked Down; Three Well-Known Figures Arrested

[Report from our newspaper] The Economic Police Brigade of the Municipal Police Bureau cracked down on two large-scale international black market gold and currency operations in the Piccadilly Apartments at the intersection of Hengshan Road and Wanping Road late the day before yesterday. They seized US$31,220, eight large gold bars, and £23 in gold pound notes. Those arrested on the spot were all prominent figures in society, including Cantonese merchant Wei Boxiang, a current foreign exchange broker for the National Bank; Mei (G. Magit), a Jewish Russian and director of the Shanghai Jewish Association; and Elzear (M.T. Elzear), a Frenchman and former president of the Shanghai French Association and manager of the Shanghai Annam Bank. After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, in addition to admitting to black market trading, they also provided other clues and information about the backers behind the scenes. The Police Bureau has already reported to Jiang Jingguo, the Shanghai Economic Control Supervisor, through Zhang, the chief of the Special Criminal Court, for approval. It turned out that the Economic Police Brigade had learned that Mei Ji, a Jewish Russian residing in Room 79, 4th floor, Piccadilly Apartments, at the intersection of Hengshan Road and Wanping Road, was using the operation of fur and import and export as a cover for engaging in black market transactions. Based on information, it was learned that Mei Ji had bought US$30,000 in the morning of the previous day and agreed to deliver the goods at 7:00 PM that evening. Cheng Yikuan, the captain of the Economic Police Brigade, immediately led Deputy Group Leader Chen Jingxing, Squad Leader Fan Mingxin, and four other team members to wait at the address. At that time, two well-dressed Cantonese men and women holding a paper bag entered the room. Because their behavior was suspicious, they followed them inside, identified themselves, and conducted a search. They found US$10,000 on the two, and another sealed paper bag containing US$20,000 under the sofa in the room. The Cantonese man, named Wei Boxiang, claimed to be a foreign exchange broker. The US$30,000 he was carrying was entrusted to him by a certain company to purchase US$34,000 worth of foreign exchange settlement certificates from the Bank of China. Both the company and Mei Ji were his clients, and he wanted to earn a commission, so he sold the US$30,000 to Mei Ji, who gave him a 120,000 Gold Yuan check plus several hundred Gold Yuan in commission. The police continued to search Mei Ji's room and found US$170 in a drawer. When asked if Mei had other black market transactions, Mei admitted that Elzear, a Frenchman residing in Room 25, 5th floor, had a transaction with him on the 23rd, where he bought US$3,000 from Elzear at the black market price. The police then went to Elzear's room and waited until 11:00 PM, when Elzear returned. They found US$1,050, £23 in gold pound notes, eight large gold bars, an unlicensed pistol, and 57 bullets in his room. Elzear admitted to selling US$3,000 to Mei Ji and confessed to having engaged in four or five black market transactions, totaling about US$20,000 to US$25,000. At this point, the police took Mei Ji, Elzear, and Wei Boxiang into custody for interrogation. It was also learned that French Consul General Buffat went to the Police Bureau on the 27th at 4:00 PM to inquire about the case after Elzear was arrested.

### Cen Liangxin is Without Conscience; Raising Prices of National Medicines; Chairman of the Board of Directors Detained for Investigation

They also reviewed the price list issued by the National Medicine Industry Association to its members on the 24th, and discovered that the prices listed on the table were based on the new prices of the 24th, backdated to the 19th, and issued to the member stores. The police bureau suspected that he had raised the prices of medicines and violated the Economic Emergency Measures Ordinance, and ordered officers to take Cen Zhiliang into custody for investigation.

### Where Did the Joint Rice Coupons Come From? Yi Feng Jin Rice Shop Engaged in Fraud, Exposed and Investigated by District Residents

Yi Feng Jin Rice Shop, located at No. 219 Nancang Street, Penglai District, recently used illegal means to obtain a large number of rice allocation certificates. Then, relying on these certificates, it took rice from the People's Food Allocation Committee and resold it for profit. This matter was discovered by more than a dozen residents living nearby, who reported it to the District People's Representative Assembly yesterday morning, requesting Chairman Zhao Bingwen to thoroughly investigate. Chairman Zhao, along with other representatives such as Liu Xianglin and Su Dan, went to the shop for investigation. They discovered more than 300 completely new, blank rice allocation certificates in the counter drawer. These certificates did not specify the district, bao, or jia household, and were all consecutively numbered, indicating they were not owned by residents but obtained from the agency responsible for issuing the rice allocation certificates. The district representatives urgently invited Mr. Si Pu, a special commissioner from the People's Food Allocation Committee stationed in the district, to inspect them, who confirmed that they were indeed consecutively numbered rice coupons. At that time, another rice shop was attempting to obtain rice with sixty rice coupons, which was also discovered by the representatives and handed over to the police for handling. Commissioner Si has already reported the rice shop's fraudulent activities to the People's Food Allocation Committee for thorough investigation, it is said.

### Cigarette Merchants Are Quite Law-Abiding, But They Hope the Tobacco Factories Will Quickly Resume Shipping Goods

[Our Newspaper News] According to sources in the cigarette industry, recent claims that "retail cigarette prices have been rising due to the actions of cigarette wholesalers and retailers" are far from the truth. Since the government reformed the currency system and ordered transactions to follow the prices of August 19th, the cigarette industry association was the first to warn its members that transactions should not exceed the price limit. Therefore, after the emergency order was issued, the cigarette market plummeted, and many prices fell to the factory wholesale price. However, now that it is autumn, cigarette sales have increased, and many merchants from various regions have come to Shanghai to purchase goods, causing an imbalance in supply and demand, which has led to slight fluctuations. However, these fluctuations have remained within the price limit. Cigarette merchants could not possibly dare to raise prices and risk breaking the law.

The entities that can influence cigarette prices are primarily the tobacco factories, followed by tobacco taxes and external factors. It has been found that since "August 19th," the various tobacco factories have not shipped any goods. Although the factory wholesale prices have not been increased, a state of "prices without goods" has been created. Cigarette merchants are facing increased sales on the outside and fear of supply shortages on the inside, a tense situation that the factories seem to ignore. Therefore, if the authorities want to stabilize cigarette prices, the industry hopes they will order the factories to quickly ship goods at the original "August 19th" factory wholesale prices. If the supply is abundant, cigarette merchants, who adhere to the principle of small profits and quick turnover, will have legitimate profits to be made, and cigarette prices will naturally fall without the need for price freezes.

### Citizen Visits Chiang Ching-kuo, Reports Wealthy Merchant's Hoarding

Yesterday morning, an anonymous citizen went to the Central Bank to see Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo. The citizen claimed to have confidential information regarding the current inspection work.

### Fishmongers Shift Location, Police Secretly Investigate to Prevent

A large team has already taken notice, and plainclothes police officers are dispatched every morning at 3:00 AM to secretly investigate, determined to close this loophole and prevent disruption of overall price controls.

### Businesses Reported for Raising Prices, Seven Responsible Individuals Detained and Punished

[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday, the police economic brigade, based on lists of businesses reported for exceeding the "August 19th" price limits, conducted investigations one by one. It was found that six businesses, including Baiji Underwear Store at No. 211 Guangyuan Road, Lanji Machine-Made Meat Factory at No. 1250 Fuxing Middle Road, Shanghai Western Restaurant on Guangdong Road, Meilindeng Pharmaceutical Factory at No. 6, Lane 1292, Zhongzheng East Road, and Wanxingzhai Restaurant at No. 714 Beijing East Road, had exceeded the price limits.

Furthermore, Da Zhong Nan South Goods Store at No. 99 Xizang South Road arbitrarily changed the price of red dates from six jiao to eight jiao and the price of dried yellow fish from six jiao per jin to six jiao seven fen. Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, Song Fang, who works at the Salt Bureau, secretly reported this to the Nanyang Bridge Police Station of the Penglai Police Precinct.

### Punishing Corrupt Officials and Eliminating Traitors, Exerting Tremendous Power, Suppression and Construction Team Starts Work, Establishes Ten Stations to Reward Reports

[Our Newspaper News] In order to cooperate with the emergency financial and economic measures and encourage the people to assist the government in implementing laws and regulations, the authorities recently transferred the Sixth Brigade of the National Defense Department's Suppression and National Construction Task Force, which was originally working on the front lines, to Shanghai to deal with unscrupulous merchants, traitors, and corrupt officials. The brigade consists of 281 members, most of whom are capable cadres of Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo. Led by Brigade Commander Wang Sheng and Brigade Deputy Commander Kong Qiuquan, they have all arrived in Shanghai and are scheduled to begin the work of eliminating traitors at 9:00 AM tomorrow.

The team has set up ten people's service stations in the city, whose tasks are: (1) to receive and convey the people's oral or written opinions to the government; (2) to receive the people's oral or written confidential reports on unscrupulous merchants and corruption. These service stations will be located in the district offices of ten districts: Huangpu, Xincheng, Lao Zha, Penglai, North Sichuan Road, North Station, Tilanqiao, Xujiahui, Lujiawan, and Jing'an Temple. Each station will have a confidential reporting box to receive any citizen's confidential reports on cases of unscrupulous merchants, traitors, and officials engaged in corruption and illegal activities. The team's staff will investigate and verify these reports and then forward them to the relevant authorities for strict handling.

Measures to Reward People for Informing. The main points of the measures to reward people for informing are as follows: (1) This brigade has set up confidential reporting boxes to assist the government in cracking down on cases involving traitors, unscrupulous merchants, and officials engaged in corruption and illegal activities. (2) Anyone who discovers suspects or items related to the cases listed in the preceding article may list the facts and confidentially report them. (3) Informants should properly seal their confidential reports and send them to the confidential reporting box set up by the People's Service Station of this brigade. (4) In all cases cracked as a result of information provided, regardless of the nature and size of the case, the informant should be rewarded. If illegal items are seized at the same time, they may also be rewarded with a percentage of the proceeds. (5) In addition to the rewards stipulated by government laws and regulations, the brigade headquarters may provide spiritual or material rewards for those not covered by these regulations. The brigade may send personnel to notify or assist the informant in receiving the reward. (6) The name, address, and other information of the informant will be kept absolutely and permanently confidential, regardless of whether the case has been cracked or not. (7) The informant may apply to this brigade for special protection if necessary. (8) Those who make false accusations out of malice will be subject to legal penalties.

Promoting the Success of Economic Reform. Brigade Commander Wang Sheng hosted a press conference yesterday afternoon at the New Life Club, reporting on the brigade's organization and mission. He expressed his willingness to be a bridge between the government and the people and called on the people of the city to take responsibility and express their opinions and actions to promote the success of economic and political reform. The Suppression and Construction Task Force was established last year, with its headquarters in Nanjing, and is divided into six brigades, working in the pacification areas of northern Jiangsu, Henan, Hebei, Xiangyang, Anhui, and Shandong. The Sixth Brigade, which has been transferred to Shanghai, was originally stationed in Hebei. Seventy percent of its members are university students, fifteen percent are military school graduates, and fifteen percent are from other schools. Starting tomorrow, in addition to accepting opinions and confidential reports from citizens in this city, it will also dispatch thirty people to Pudong, fifty people to Wuxi, and other cities along the Beijing-Shanghai line that have close economic ties with this city to carry out the same work.

### Chiang Ching-kuo Firmly Stated, "Better One Family Cries Than the Whole Road Cries," Will Show No Mercy in Any Area, Will Personally Meet with the Public Two Days a Week Hereafter

Yesterday, amidst his busy schedule, Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo attended the press conference of the Sixth Brigade of the Suppression and Construction Task Force and delivered his first speech since taking office as the Economic Supervisor of the Shanghai District. Mr. Chiang believes that the success or failure of the emergency economic measures depends on two points: (1) Whether the government has the determination. (2) Whether the people actively participate in the implementation of the policy. He stated that in the past, the people and the government were very isolated, and some public opinion organizations could not truly represent public opinion. The establishment of people's service stations by the Suppression and Construction Task Force is very appropriate, as it can truly bring the government and the people together, serving as eyes and ears for the government and as a voice for the people. Regarding the inspection work, this time, no mercy will be shown to any party, but the people will absolutely not be disturbed. In the past, some people have used the opportunity of inspection to extort money, and this will be strictly prevented in the future. After the establishment of the service stations, the people can also supervise them. In short, the principle of implementing economic policies is "Better one family cries than the whole road cries." If the people can accurately point out unscrupulous merchants and corrupt officials, he will definitely be able to punish them. He encouraged the members of the Suppression and Construction Task Force to always maintain the style of "country bumpkins," to maintain integrity, determination, perseverance, and active patience to serve the country. He also expressed the hope that the service stations can be further promoted and the people organized, so that the atmosphere in Shanghai can be changed in a year or two. Finally, Mr. Chiang stated that storms or disturbances are inevitable in the future, but as long as we remain calm and determined, he believes that there will be no difficulties. There is no power in the world greater than the power of the people, and no words are more accurate than the words of the people. He plans to personally meet with the public every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon to directly listen to the voices of the people, he said.

### Vegetable Market Prices Generally Stable, But 20 More Meat Merchants Arrested

Red candles burned brightly in front of the niche, incense smoke swirled, and the sacrificial ceremony began in a solemn atmosphere.

### Robbery Case on Tiantong Road, Three Criminals Arrested One After Another

[Our Newspaper News] At around 4:00 AM on the 23rd, two robbers suddenly broke into the home of Ma Jinghuai at No. 4 Dening Lane, Tiantong Road, and stole a large number of clothes and gold jewelry before fleeing. Afterwards, the victim reported the incident to the North Sichuan Road Police Precinct. Precinct Chief Wu Quan ordered Criminal Section Chief Lin Chaohua to investigate and set a deadline for solving the case. After two days of investigation, it was discovered that Guo Kailai (also known as Xiaogoushi), who had previously committed theft and made a living by pedaling a tricycle, lived nearby. The stolen goods that night were also transported by tricycle, making him suspicious. According to a confidential report, Guo Kailai's actions had been secretive and cowardly in the past two days. Combining these points, it was determined that Guo was indeed involved in the case. Guo was apprehended around 12:00 PM on the 26th and interrogated strictly. According to his confession, he had been unemployed for a long time and was struggling to make a living. A few days ago, he met his friend Zhang Jinbiao (also known as Sanguozi), and they conceived the evil idea. Guo provided the route and secretly planned to rob No. 4 Dening Lane, Tiantong Road. That night, Zhang recruited accomplices Xu Zhongjian (also known as Xiao Sizi), and the two of them entered the house armed to commit the robbery. Guo waited outside on a tricycle. The stolen goods were taken away and sold by them, and he only received 95 million yuan to spend. Zhang Jinbiao lived in a shanty town at No. 85 Tongzhou Road, and the gun belonged to him, he said. Based on the confession, police officers Zhang Decai, Wang Fusheng, Yang Zhongzhou, and Lin Mingsheng rushed to the address and apprehended Zhang Jinbiao. They also recovered a gun and four bullets from a hole in his wall and brought them to the bureau. He admitted to the robbery without denying it, but claimed not to know the whereabouts of the other accomplice, Xu Zhongtie. After investigation, it was found that Xu had previously been detained and sent to a vocational training institute by the police precinct for improper behavior. The police were ordered to go to the institute to inquire and learned that he had been bailed out of the Hailong Tea Chess Club at No. 105 Bansongyuan Road, Nanshi a month ago. The owner of the tea house was summoned to the bureau, and he also claimed that Xu had no fixed address. Section Chief Lin ordered him to find a way to lure him to the tea chess club and sent police officers to lie in wait. Sure enough, Xu was seen leisurely arriving at the tea chess club at around 9:00 PM that afternoon, and the waiting police officers arrested him and brought him to the bureau for joint handling. In summary, the case was solved in just 72 hours, it is said.

### The Desolate Porcelain City

— Special Correspondent Yu Ningpo of Our Newspaper

[Jingdezhen, 24th (Quick Report)] Housing in Jingdezhen has always been cheaper than in Nanchang. Now, the rent for a medium-sized house is more than 60 shi of white rice. Shops with limited capital are already feeling overwhelmed by the rent alone. Other expenses, such as taxes, wages, food, and miscellaneous expenses, average 3 to 4 million yuan per day. The night market in the porcelain city is not as lively as it was last year, with its bright lights and busy traffic. The electric lights are dimmed, providing a dim and hypnotic effect, appearing light and desolate.

The Future is Worrying. The sales aspect is the most worrying part of the entire porcelain industry's future. Finished porcelain needs a large sales market, with supply and demand corresponding to each other, in order to support production. Otherwise, supply without demand will cause the product to bloat. Kilns will inevitably have to reduce production in order to save costs. However, the price of porcelain is increasing with the price of everything else. According to recent porcelain market prices from various local markets, they are almost equal to the current prices in the production area.

Suffering Greatly from Japanese Porcelain. Especially in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, Japanese porcelain is being sold in large quantities. Because Japanese-made porcelain is cheaper than Chinese porcelain, and its products are more innovative in design, Jingdezhen porcelain in the Southeast Asian market is undoubtedly unable to resist the threat of Japanese goods. If porcelain prices continue to rise indefinitely, Chinese porcelain will fall further behind. This is a fundamental issue related to the rise and fall of China's porcelain industry. The government and the porcelain industry need to have the power to revive the industry and compete with foreign porcelain.

Quickly Seek an Appropriate Solution. Reduced production of porcelain will inevitably result in the closure of many workers' jobs. There are no fewer than 50,000 kiln workers here. Once they stop working and become unemployed, how will they live? The relevant authorities cannot ignore this serious problem. The crisis is now all around. It is hoped that the government will quickly seek an appropriate solution. This is precisely what the entire town's industry, commerce, and more than 100,000 citizens are unanimously hoping for.

### Eliminating Malpractices in Conscription; Implementing Improvements

Order Issued by the Ministry of National Defense for Local Compliance

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 26th] In response to numerous malpractices in new recruit deliveries from various regions during the first half of this year, the Ministry of National Defense, based on multiple investigations and reports, has formulated a set of improvement measures for addressing malpractices in new recruit conscription, ordering all military and division command areas to implement them: (1) Each division and regimental command area must conscientiously conscript in accordance with the law. Those who do not meet the current active duty age or are old and infirm and unfit for service must not be conscripted. Violators will be punished. (2) Each province and city should strictly follow the regulations for conscripting soldiers in major cities, giving priority to enlisting local indigenous people, obtaining surety from store owners to guarantee no escape, and strictly preventing local ruffians from selling or replacing conscripts, so as to emphasize the importance of conscription policy. Violators will be punished.

[Another Dispatch] The conscription quota for Jiangsu Province in the second half of the year is a total of 36,000 people. The quota for each county has been allocated. Conscription will begin on September 1 and will be completed by September 20.

### Wang Zuo-zhou Rebellion Rumor Found to Be Untrue

[Our Ningbo Dispatch of the 27th] It was reported that Wang Zuo-zhou, the captain of the Zhenhai County security police squadron, led his troops in a rebellion some days ago and his whereabouts are unknown. It has now been verified that this is not true. Wang himself had left earlier with former County Magistrate Zhou Lishan. His vacancy has been filled by Squad Leader Li Bin, who is currently stationed in the Longshan Jiangnan area of the city, and discipline is good. As for County Magistrate Jiang and Police Chief He, their trip to Chaiqiao was to personally lead troops to defend against Xu Xiaoyu's bandit gang disturbing the Meishan Zhitou area.

### Haining Dike Supervisor Swept Away by Tidal Bore, Later Rescued

[Our Haining Dispatch of the 26th] In the 11th Bao area along the Qiantang River, east of Zhuqiao Town in this county, the Dike Construction Bureau is currently building a large dike.

He was rescued by workers, suffering serious injuries, and was sent to Hangzhou for treatment by special car today. His life is in danger.

### Representatives of the Kyrgyz People of Southern Xinjiang Submit "Opinions" in Eleven Articles; Relevant Departments of Xinjiang Province Are Studying Them

[Our Dihua Airmail Dispatch of the 19th] Kyrgyz people's representatives from Southern Xinjiang, Zhu Nuqi, Yu Huifu, and others, came to Dihua and submitted "Opinions" in eleven articles to the authorities. The Northwest Military and Political Government has forwarded them to the Xinjiang Provincial Government for transfer to relevant departments for study. The "Opinions" are recorded as follows:

(A) Regarding Relief: (1) During Sheng Shicai's time, a large number of Kyrgyz people were arrested and their property was confiscated. Currently, the families and orphans of the victims are living in extreme difficulty. Please provide relief and, according to Kyrgyz religious customs, recite scriptures and hold memorial services for the victims. (2) Please allocate seeds and loans annually to develop cultivation. (3) Poor Kyrgyz people in Ush and Wensu counties in the Koksu region are in extreme poverty. Please allocate land for cultivation so they can make a living. (4) Since 1945, Kyrgyz people in Aksu and Kashgar regions have suffered greatly due to turmoil, leading to extreme hardship. Please continue to allocate funds for relief.

(B) Regarding Personnel: (1) In terms of population proportion in Aksu and Kashgar regions, the Kyrgyz are second only to the Uyghurs. It is proposed that the government increase the number of deputy commissioners in both regions, selecting and appointing Kyrgyz people to fill the positions. (2) Very few Kyrgyz people participate in government work, making it difficult for lower-level situations to be reported to higher levels. In the future, please employ them as provincial government advisors and senators, and select Kyrgyz personnel from Aksu and Kashgar regions as deputy county magistrates, deputy speakers of county councils, deputy directors, and township heads, giving the Kyrgyz people as many opportunities to serve as possible, so that they can enjoy equal political participation rights. (3) In previous elections, such as county and provincial senators, commissioners, county magistrates, and National Assembly representatives, the Kyrgyz people have not been able to participate. Please grant the Kyrgyz people the electoral rights they should enjoy.

(C) Regarding Construction, Health, and Education: (1) Please allocate funds to build highways and bridges in Aksu and Kashgar regions and open up border transportation. (2) Establish clinics and veterinary stations in areas where Kyrgyz people live to emphasize the health of people and livestock.

### Marriage Turns to Smoke; Lovers Commit Suicide; Buddhist Mountain Foolish Couple Stages "Love Casting"; Parents Regret and Hang Themselves

[Our Guangzhou Airmail Dispatch of the 25th] A marital tragedy occurred in Foshan County some days ago, resulting in the deaths of four people, truly a modern Chinese version of "Love Casting." A resident of the city, Huo Wang, and his wife, Jiang, were merchants and quite wealthy. They had an only son, Huo Gui, 22 years old, intelligent and handsome. After graduating from middle school, he returned home to learn commerce from his father. Over the years, he fell in love with Liu Qiqiong, a young woman across the street. Huo recently informed his parents that he wanted to propose marriage. However, Huo's father and Liu's family had a long-standing feud, so he used the excuse that "Liu has a scar on her left forehead like a coin, which is an omen of killing her husband," and strictly forbade Huo Gui from interacting with Liu. Because his wish could not be fulfilled, Gui conceived a desire to die. On the morning of the 25th, taking advantage of his father's slightly lax vigilance, he quietly slipped away and arranged to meet Qiqiong at the beach, where they both committed suicide by jumping into the sea. They left behind a suicide poem on the beach, which read: "Stubborn superstition repeats the words, a perfect marriage turns to smoke, unwilling to be husband and wife in the next life, together we jump into the sea to end our earthly ties." The father arrived at the scene a moment after they jumped into the water, and upon seeing the poem, he regretted it so much that he despaired of losing his beloved son. He and his wife also hanged themselves that night. The next morning, neighbors discovered them and provided coffins for burial.

### Wuxi Uncovers a Large Drug Den

### Our World Games Football Team in Hong Kong Plans to Raise Funds to Repay Travel Expenses; Rong Qizhao Talks About the Need for a Professional Coach

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 27th] Rong Qizhao, the leader of our football delegation to the World Games, told reporters yesterday: Our team failed in the first match against Turkey in the World Games due to poor physical condition and unfamiliarity with fighting in the rain. Our delegation has been here for two days and plans to disband after a final exhibition match here. According to reports, the delegation was originally scheduled to play against the Philippine United Team in Manila, but it was canceled due to rain. Rong continued that another reason for our team's failure was the lack of a professional coach. All European and American football teams have professional coaches, which is essential for a good team. Rong also said that the football team was short of travel expenses and almost stranded in the UK to buy plane tickets. The team still owes 20,000 Hong Kong dollars in airfare. Fortunately, the Tongji Long Company of overseas Chinese in London helped, and the company paid for the entire football team's plane tickets to return home. Rong said that if possible, the football delegation will raise funds to repay the amount. He is currently preparing to put on an exhibition match here, hoping that ticket revenue will offset the arrears. Rong also said that our football delegation to the World Games did not receive any funds from our World Games delegation. All expenses for the football team's trip to the UK were paid for by exhibition match income along the way, but due to the impact of bad weather and the cancellation of the original game, the total income of the football team was only 26,700 Hong Kong dollars, and after entering London, the remaining amount was only 20,000 Hong Kong dollars. As for the situation of the team in the UK, Rong said that the team's actions in the UK were exemplary and truly commendable.

### Youth and Literature

— Zhu Ziqing's posthumous work

Many young people love literature. More than half not only love reading, but also love writing. Their common questions are: What to read? How to write?

Reading interest is probably concentrated on vernacular new literature. This is further divided into creative writing and translation. It seems that there is more love for domestic creative writing, because after all, local customs are more familiar. In the past 30 years, there have been many readable new literature works, but here I would like to first bring up Mr. Lu Xun and Mr. Mao Dun. They have a Selected Works of Lu Xun and a Selected Works of Mao Dun, but unfortunately these two books do not seem to have been reprinted now, and it is not easy to get them. Then, it is better to first read Mr. Lu Xun's "Call to Arms" and "Hot Wind", and Mr. Mao Dun's "Eclipse" (including the trilogy "Wavering", "Illusion", and "Pursuit"). For translation, you can first read the classics, such as the Mandarin Bible, Mr. Chuan Donghua's translation of the "Odyssey" and the "Life of Don Quixote", Mr. Cao Weifeng's translation of the Complete Works of Shakespeare, Mr. Zhou Xuepu's or Mr. Guo Moruo's translation of "Faust", Mr. Guo Moruo's and Mr. Gao Di's translation of "War and Peace", Mr. Wei Congwu's translation of "Crime and Punishment", and Mr. Fu Lei's translation of "Jean-Christophe". Old novels and ancient literature should also be continued. For the former, you can first read "Water Margin", "Journey to the West", and "Dream of the Red Chamber", and for the latter, you can first read the "Language and Text Comparison" of "Guguan Zhizhi" and "Three Hundred Tang Poems" – the former can be read with Mr. Yao Tuixiang's translation and notes, and the latter can be read with Mr. Yao Nailin's translation and notes.

Writing interest used to seem to be concentrated on pure literature, but now it is gradually shifting towards miscellaneous literature. This is a healthy and wise change. To express and criticize this era, the need for miscellaneous literature seems to be greater than that of pure literature. Miscellaneous literature is the combination of newspapers and literature. Newspapers are obviously something that everyone wants to read. On the one hand, writing achievements in miscellaneous literature are not too difficult, but pure literature is much more difficult.

Editor's Note: This article is Mr. Zhu's unpublished posthumous work, submitted to this journal for publication by Mr. Gu Qizhong of the Editorial Department of the Baixin Bookstore in this city. Mr. Gu said: "Last year, Baixin Bookstore prepared to publish a diary, and wanted to invite famous scholars in China to write a short piece of text to guide young people at the beginning of each month. At that time, the plan was finalized, and letters were sent to Ye Shengtao, Zhu Ziqing, Yu Pingbo, Fu Binran, Gu Junzheng... to write. Due to time constraints, this diary was not published last year, and it was planned to be published this year. Unexpectedly, Mr. Zhu suddenly passed away. I will transcribe it, one to provide for those who compile Mr. Zhu Guang's complete works to collect, and one to allow readers to read it in advance."

### On the Use of the Brush

— Qiu Shiming

In the past, I once chatted with Jin Xihou about the use of the brush. Old Xi said that there are three difficulties in brushwork for calligraphers: First, to be able to use the brush tip, concentrating the force at the tip of the hair; second, to be able to use the belly of the brush, channeling the force from the tip into the belly; and third, to concentrate the force in the heart of the brush, as if the center of the brush has a magnetic needle that can draw all the hairs together in the center, so that using the brush is like using a magnetic needle. It is said that this is the ability to use the heart of the brush. Since ancient times, there have been few calligraphers who could use the heart of the brush. Since the Yuan and Ming dynasties, there have been very few painters who excelled in the use of the brush, and I am one of them. Alas, what am I capable of that I am so highly regarded! I will briefly describe my experience to help others study.

When I first started learning to paint, I used a goat-hair brush and preferred long bristles. The longer and softer the bristles, the harder it is to apply force from the wrist, making it difficult to wield, especially when painting. However, because I insisted on using it, I had to exert all my strength. When finger strength was insufficient, I used my wrist; when wrist strength was insufficient, I used my elbow, my arm, and my body, standing up from a seated position, ultimately putting all my strength into it. Also, I always held the brush high, near the top of the handle. The higher the grip, the harder it is to apply force, so I was constantly troubled by insufficient wrist strength. To achieve quick results, I practiced calligraphy. I studied medicine not for the sake of calligraphy, but to train my brushwork. And the effect was many times greater than painting. Over the course of several years, I initially experienced arm soreness and lower back pain, but eventually all my strength was channeled from my arm to my elbow, wrist, finger, handle top, brush tip, and brush belly without me realizing I was exerting force. The softness and hardness of the bristles also changed miraculously: when there was enough force, even soft and long bristles would turn hard, because I utilized their elasticity. It is like crossing a ditch: jumping from the edge of the ditch is not as easy as stepping back and taking a running start. Therefore, when using long, soft bristles, one must concentrate the force at the brush tip and adopt a reverse approach, so that the soft bristles will naturally become hard and be controlled. It is not that the nature of the bristles has changed, but that they have been made to change through use. After ten years of this, I read ancient accounts and realized that this was the central brush technique. Therefore, at that time, I mainly used goat-hair brushes, valuing softness over strength. Later, a friend brought back sturdy bristles from Japan that were very elastic, bending and rebounding. When I tried them, I found them very different. So I asked a brush shop to imitate them. After using them for a long time, I realized that the use of purple wolf-hair brushes had advantages that goat-hair brushes could not match, and the wonder of softness within strength was thus achieved. At this point, I had strength without exerting effort.

However, this is not easy to explain. If one does not have the skill of using soft bristles and suddenly uses sturdy bristles, one will inevitably appear tense and aggressive, seemingly strong but lacking substance, and the meaning will be dull. This is in terms of the hardness and softness of the bristles. As for the use of the brush, there are differences between the central, oblique, and concealed techniques. I have already spoken of the central and concealed techniques. The so-called oblique technique refers to dragging the brush sideways smoothly, and the force varies between the brush tip, brush belly, and brush root. There is also a saying about starting the brush. When I first started using the brush, I mainly focused on the central technique, focusing the force on the brush tip, rejecting the oblique technique as a flawed stroke, and especially avoiding using the brush root. After another ten years, I realized that each has its own merits and should not be limited to one. The expression in painting is more complex than in calligraphy, and the use of the brush cannot be fully covered by one approach. Furthermore, calligraphy has two paths, the masculine and the feminine, and scholars can specialize in each and reach its peak. But painting often combines both strength and softness in one piece, and the use of the brush is always diverse. Even broken or blunt brushes each have their own use. However, with a broken brush and the oblique technique, one must still focus the force on the brush tip in order to express the artistic intent.

As for the discussion of high and low brush grips, previous people have not discussed it in detail. In my experience, it is also quite interesting. When I first held the brush, I held it high, near the top of the handle, because it allowed for rotation in all directions, which is unattainable for those who hold it low. Although it is more difficult for beginners, it is much more transcendent when mastered. Therefore, at that time, I strongly criticized the problem of holding the brush too low, saying that if one can hold the brush high, then holding it low will be easy. However, I did not know that holding it low has its own advantages, such as the press-down stroke and the kick stroke, which cannot be done without holding it low. Only after making progress in painting did I gradually understand this. Therefore, when I paint, I often hold the brush high and low, fast and slow, like a musician plucking strings, with endless changes in tone. Furthermore, the brush has emptiness and fullness, and it is even harder to describe when the meaning is complete even before the brush has touched the paper. As for saying that brushes are divided into large and small, each with its own specialization and cannot be forced, I have more to say.

When I first held the brush, I used it as described above, so the brushes I used were rarely large. Over time, I developed a skill for using small brushes to achieve great effects. In the past ten years, I have also used large brushes. For example, when painting large sunflowers, I would use one stroke to paint a five-foot stem. Only a large brush can achieve a round, full, and powerful effect. I then realized that using a large brush as if it were small is different from using a small brush to represent a large one.

In short, the way of using the brush is to ensure that every hair is applied with force to the paper, with no idle hairs. Then whether it is empty or full, using the brush tip, brush root, brush belly, or brush heart, using the central technique, oblique technique, or concealed technique, holding the brush high or low, adopting a reverse or smooth approach, the softness or hardness of the bristles, their size, length, or shortness, all are wonderful. The key is to use them in all aspects, from difficult to easy.

### Fake Antiques in Paris

— Lin

A few years ago, there was a man in Paris who specialized in counterfeiting ancient embroidery. His products were extremely exquisite, and even experts were fooled by him. He made a lot of money. Later, because of disagreements with his assistant, the assistant reported him to the authorities in anger, and the truth came to light. It turned out that this counterfeiter of embroidery was quite clever. He first embroidered patterns with a special colored silk thread, and then hung them behind a car and dragged them on the road. Then, he applied a special type of soot all over to give them not only an "antique look" but also an "antique fragrance." Then, he used ultraviolet light to fade the colors so that they were not as bright and dazzling as before. Finally, he scraped off a lot of old dust from the beams of chapels and rubbed it into the gaps in the embroidery—and as a result, they became "delightful" antiques.

### Photographs

— Ji Mo

Someone discovered a photograph in Time magazine of the late Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk attending a United Nations conference wearing his glasses upside down. They wrote a letter to the editorial department to point this out, considering it very strange. The editorial department republished the photograph, and after careful examination, I found that what they said was true, they were indeed worn upside down. It turns out that the temples of new-style glasses are wide and flat, so naturally it is not as easy to distinguish the front and back as with curved temples. However, the nose pads of the frame would be on top of the nose bridge if worn upside down, which would be immediately obvious.

Because one pays attention to photographs, one can sometimes discover these interesting facts. Therefore, I originally enjoyed browsing pictures and photographs, and after this revelation, I now look at them even more carefully. The first thing I pay attention to is several photographs of Stalin taken on different occasions. Some were group photos with Roosevelt and Churchill at the Three-Power Conference, and some were taken alone. In these photos, although the times differ, they all have the same characteristic: he is sitting, wearing his military cap and uniform neatly, with his elbows resting on the armrests of the chair, his fingers crossed on his knees, and his legs also crossed under the chair. His expression is very natural, but the naturalness reveals an air of restraint, enough to show that he is a man of firm opinions and does things meticulously. In contrast, Roosevelt's photos show him tilting his head and looking sideways, with one leg straight and one leg slightly bent. Churchill even reclines in the chair with half of his body, stretching his legs out in front of the chair, much more casual than Stalin.

We can also deduce the rise and fall in the official career of a person from their photographs. A certain magazine published a collection of photographs of Marshall together. Initially, he was an advisor to former Secretary of War Stimson. At the Casablanca Conference, he stood next to President Roosevelt. At the Yalta Conference, he stood in the second row behind the three giants. Later, he received medals from Charles de Gaulle of France and Soviet Ambassador to the United States Gromyko, showing his emerging talent. A more recent photograph shows Marshall standing in front of a microphone giving a speech, while President Truman sits behind him listening quietly. The caption of the photograph says that President Truman praised him as "the greatest American of our time." Marshall's rapid rise to prominence can be seen from this.

Under the arrangement of those skilled in scheming, photographs can also be used as a tool to achieve certain goals. A certain issue of the British magazine "Picture Post" published a photo of British Prime Minister Attlee personally pinning flowers on the lapel of U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder. The caption praised Snyder as one of the most powerful people in the world because he participated in the major plan for loans to Europe. The implication seemed to be to curry favor with Snyder in the hope of obtaining more loans. In addition to its news value, the photograph was also intended for other purposes.

In recent years, American popular magazines such as Time, Life, U.S. News & World Report, and Business Week have also published portraits on their covers. Most of the close-ups of the head or upper body feature smiling faces, accounting for at least seven or eight out of ten. The power struggles and intricate techniques of some of these great figures are covered up by their "harmony" without leaving a trace.

### Old Acquaintances in a Foreign Land

— Mao Yi

During the Boxer Rebellion, when Tianjin was under siege, Tang Shaoyi fled to the American concession to take refuge. One day, a cannonball crashed through the roof of Tang's house, killing Tang Shaoyi's wife and one of his daughters, who was still in swaddling clothes. At that time, Herbert Hoover, who was later elected President of the United States, was working as an engineer at the Kailuan Coal Mine in China and lived across the street. He fearlessly rushed into the burning Tang residence and rescued Tang's other little daughter from the flying bullets.

Many years later, Hoover was serving as the head of the Food Administration in Washington, D.C. The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Wellington Koo, invited him to dinner. During the meal, Madame Koo smiled and said, "Mr. Hoover, we have met before."

Hoover frowned, trying to remember the meeting. In the end, Madame Koo solved the mystery. "I am Tang Shaoyi's daughter, the girl you rescued when Tianjin was under siege!" she said.

### Humorous Antithetical Couplets

— Yi Yun

This newspaper has repeatedly published antithetical couplets from various authors, all of which are extremely refined. However, couplets with humorous and witty elements are particularly pleasing. At this time of worrying about the country, the people, and poverty, everyone's brows are furrowed. Let me offer some humorous words to elicit a laugh, which the readers may not reject. The following is a detailed account:

A certain section chief was unlearned and used vulgar language, which had long dissatisfied his colleagues. One day, a staff member argued with him based on the rules of official duties. The section chief became furious and shouted "Get out!" The entire section was shocked, and they rose up to question him. As a result, the anger of the masses was too much to bear, and the section chief apologized. A witty person came up with a couplet: "The word 'get out' is more glorious than elaborate praise." For a time, no one could come up with a matching line. The expression was derived from the idiom "one word can ruin a country," inverting the meaning and using the similar sounds of "praise" and "get out" to make it particularly clever. Before long, the section chief's wife ran away with her lover and disappeared outside the pass (Zhangjiakou). Immediately, someone happily came up with a good match: "That woman's departure can be expressed." This also takes the idiom "that woman's mouth can emit orchids" and inverts it to create a humorous effect, which can be said to be teasing and cruel.

The story of Wang Renqiu's love for Zhou Ma has long been widely circulated. Wang taught at the Chuanshan Academy. In his later years, for the sake of retirement, he built the Xiangqi Building in his hometown to live in. Zhou Ma's old residence was also located in Qilipu in the same county. After Wang died, Zhou Ma also left Wang's residence and returned to her old residence in Qilipu. Someone made a humorous eulogy: "Lecturing on Chuanshan studies, reading sages, a famous scholar is naturally romantic, but afraid that Lord Zhou will come to ask about silk." "Climbing the Xiangqi Building, encircling Qilipu, the beauty is still there, not going with Prince Wang to seek immortality." The phrases "Lord Zhou" and "Prince Wang seeking immortality" are humorous and witty.

In official letters and documents, subordinates invariably show extreme respect for superiors, almost to the point of raising them to the heavens without end. They invariably show extreme humility towards themselves, almost to the point of suppressing themselves to hell, still needing to be more humble. This situation has not changed slightly from the Qing Dynasty to the present. Someone made a couplet: "Respected Sir, may you rise higher and higher, reaching the thirty-third heaven, to tile the roof for the Jade Emperor." "I, the insignificant one, deserve to die, dying in the eighteenth level of hell, mining coal for Lord Yama." There are many today who like to flatter their superiors and are willing to mine coal below the eighteenth level of hell.

At the end of the Qing Dynasty, a certain literati liked to write humorous couplets, and although it caused various disputes, he never changed. Someone who had become wealthy as a butcher and obtained an official position by paying for it, wore his official hat and robe and held a banquet to receive congratulations. The literati sent a couplet: "In the past, he blew pig's trotters with his mouth," "Today, he wears horseshoe sleeves on his hands." Although the language was vulgar, it was vivid and realistic. The reader laughed, and the butcher was so angry that he wanted to stab him with a sharp blade, and the dispute was settled only after mediation.

### Pleading for Fellow Sufferers "Reader Relief Fund" Calls for Donations

The 25th Application Period Has Begun and Will End Soon

The relief funds for the nine people approved in the 24th round of the "Reader Relief Fund" have been issued some time ago. Since the 25th application period began on August 17, we have received more than ten applications so far, but most of them are incomplete. Those with addresses have been returned to the original applicants one by one, asking them to complete the procedures and resubmit them for review.

This relief fund is specifically set up for fellow sufferers who are orphans, widows, poor, sick, elderly, weak, disabled, and crippled. The application procedure is to prepare an application form detailing the applicant's background and family situation, have it stamped and certified by the local Baozhang or Jiazhang, and send it to the Social Services Section of this newspaper by registered mail for review. Those who are found to be truly in need after investigation will be given relief funds as appropriate.

Also, due to the recent surge in the amount of relief funds, the original fund is about to be exhausted. We hope that enthusiastic readers from all walks of life will, with the compassion of those who feel hungry and drowned, generously donate so that these fellow sufferers can receive the comfort of human sympathy and regain the courage to seek survival. This is what our colleagues in this column are sincerely praying for.
