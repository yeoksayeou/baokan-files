### Government Improves Foreign Exchange Management, Adopts Exchange Settlement Certificate Method, Central Bank Governor Announces Implementation Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] Central Bank Governor Yu Hongjun, at a press conference last night (30th) at 6 PM, issued a written statement formally announcing the improvement of the current Central Bank's foreign exchange control regulations starting today (31st), deciding to adopt the exchange settlement certificate method. The original text of Yu's written statement is as follows:

Since the Executive Yuan promulgated the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Control Measures on August 18th of last year, a Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee was established within the Central Bank to assess market supply and demand and adjust foreign exchange market prices. In December of the same year, the National Government promulgated the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Control Act, which was immediately implemented, achieving some success in absorbing export foreign exchange and overseas Chinese remittances. By the beginning of this year, with rising commodity prices and a growing foreign exchange black market, people became uneasy, fearing that raising exchange rates would stimulate the market and affect commodity prices. Under these circumstances, the Stabilization Committee hesitated to adjust exchange rates, leading to an increasing gap between the Stabilization Committee's market price and the black market exchange rate. As a result, export trade was significantly affected. Most overseas remittances flowed into the black market, while importers could still purchase foreign exchange at the Stabilization Committee's market price, which was not only a special privilege but also unfair. Various parties have repeatedly suggested improving the import and export exchange settlement methods to smoothly promote export trade, bring overseas Chinese remittances into the formal channels, and ensure that importers pay a reasonably fair price for imported goods, thereby balancing the interests of importers and exporters. After careful consideration, the government decided to adopt the exchange settlement certificate method, adding supplementary regulations within the scope of the current Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Control Act, to be implemented from May 31st of this year, aiming to achieve the objectives.

Imports of Rice, Flour, Fertilizer, and Cotton

Will Still Be Calculated at the Stabilization Committee's Exchange Rate

Furthermore, to avoid stimulating commodity prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, imports of rice, wheat, flour, fertilizer, and cotton, when requiring foreign exchange settlement approved by the government, will not need to use exchange settlement certificates and will still be calculated at the Stabilization Committee's exchange rate. The above measures are necessary to correct the current economic malaise. Smoothly promoting export goods will naturally increase production, and bringing overseas Chinese remittances into the formal channels will also enrich the source of foreign exchange, which will greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. The Central Bank's and the Export-Import Control Committee's original English Circular No. 131, which stipulated import exchange settlement methods, has been decided, after consultation, to be cancelled from May 31st.

The main points of adopting the exchange settlement certificate method are as follows: (1) After exporters sell their foreign exchange to designated banks at the benchmark exchange rate announced by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee (such as US dollars at 474,000 yuan), the designated banks may, on behalf of the Central Bank, issue exchange settlement certificates to the exporters. (2) Exchange settlement certificates must be endorsed before they can be transferred. The transferees are limited to importers holding import licenses or other customers authorized to purchase foreign exchange from designated banks; otherwise, they are invalid. (3) When holders of exchange settlement certificates transfer their certificates in accordance with the preceding paragraph, the price will be determined by the buyer and seller. (4) The validity period of exchange settlement certificates is limited to seven days from the date of issuance and cannot be extended. If holders of exchange settlement certificates cannot transfer their certificates within the time limit, they may sell them back to designated banks or the Central Bank before the deadline. In addition to Governor Yu, those who attended the reception yesterday included Huo Baoshu, Chairman of the Export-Import Control Committee; Dai Mingli, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance; Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank; Shen Xirui, Director of the Business Bureau; and Shao Zenghua, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau. They respectively explained the various provisions of the new measures within their respective areas of responsibility. Chairman Huo also made two annotations on the spirit of the new measures: (1) In terms of trade, to ensure the smooth flow of goods under the necessary conditions. (2) In terms of foreign exchange, to ensure spending within means under planned conditions. (Answers to foreign exchange questions and instructions on the use of exchange settlement certificates are published on page two.)

### Investigation of the Situation of Northeast Circulation Vouchers, The Central Government Specially Forms an Inspection Team, The Issuance of Circulation Vouchers Will Be Stopped and Exchange Rates Will Be Revised

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch on the 30th] In order to understand the issuance of Northeast circulation vouchers and the true situation of the Northeast currency system, the Executive Yuan decided at the previous administrative meeting to form an inspection team composed of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Food to go to the Northeast to inspect. The team will be led by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. After the establishment of the new Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Budget, Accounting and Statistics will continue to lead the team. In addition to investigation, its task will also be to establish a national treasury system in the Northeast so that it is the same as the national treasury system established in the mainland, in order to avoid financial chaos.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch on the 30th] The measures for dealing with Northeast circulation vouchers, which Gan Naiguang and Zhang Jia'ao previously replied to the petition delegation of the Northeast National Representatives, will be announced and implemented soon. The measures stipulate that the exchange rate between circulation vouchers and legal tender is 1 to 11.5. After this, the issuance of circulation vouchers will be stopped. As for remittances from the Northeast to the mainland, the method of restricting cash remittances will still be followed. Remittances within 200 million yuan can be freely remitted, and remittances above 200 million yuan must first be reported to the Central Bank and approved before they can be remitted. According to financial circles, the new exchange rate for circulation vouchers will be implemented from June 1st.

Editorial

### New Changes in Foreign Exchange Policy

The current foreign exchange measures are stretched thin and plagued with numerous problems, making further delay untenable. This newspaper, in an article titled "Demanding a New Foreign Exchange Policy" on the 28th of this month, has already pointed out various shortcomings and possible improvements. Yesterday, Minister of Finance Yu officially announced the implementation measures for exchange settlement certificates, effective today. While this may seem slow to those expecting immediate action, it is still better late than never.

The aforementioned implementation measures consist of twenty-three articles, detailed in today's edition of this newspaper. The main points are as follows:

(1) After obtaining an import license, importers should negotiate with exporters to purchase exchange settlement certificates. The price, in addition to the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund rates, may be freely negotiated between the two parties with a premium. This means: (A) For future import foreign exchange, except for rice, wheat, flour, fertilizer, and cotton, the Central Bank will no longer supply it; (B) Importers will negotiate purchases from exporters themselves, and the Central Bank will not interfere with the level of the premium, essentially creating a free exchange rate; (C) However, the management of foreign exchange and import/export trade will not be abolished, meaning it is a disguised implementation of a linked import-export system.

(2) Designated banks may purchase original currency remittances (including remittances from overseas Chinese, foreign governments, churches, charities, and others) and foreign currency within the country based on the current exchange premium rates. This means: (A) Future remittances from overseas Chinese can be converted into legal tender at market prices; (B) Although foreign currencies within the country are not allowed to circulate freely, they can be sold to designated banks at market prices. This buying and selling constitutes open transactions, not black market dealings or illegal activities; (C) Foreign currency deposits held by Chinese citizens can also be repatriated under these exchange settlement measures, no longer frozen.

(3) The import exchange settlement measures, which previously required importers to deposit margin money, are now abolished, fundamentally resolving this dispute.

According to these regulations, significant issues such as the implementation of linked import-export trade, the opening up of self-provided foreign exchange, and the attraction of overseas Chinese remittances have now been addressed to a considerable extent. This can only be described as a timely measure. If implemented properly and without the addition of unreasonable restrictions, we believe that the current deadlock in foreign trade can be broken. However, there are several secondary issues that must be discussed incidentally, as follows:

First, the import quota issue is not mentioned here, presumably remaining in effect. However, in the past, quota allocations were based on the amount of foreign exchange supplied. Now that importers are allowed to purchase regular exchange settlement certificates from exporters and special exchange settlement certificates from designated banks, it is unclear how quotas will be allocated when applying for licenses.

Second, the issue of handling goods with self-provided foreign exchange. According to Article 8 of the new measures, this foreign exchange can be sold to designated banks at market prices. However, according to Article 11, designated banks must deposit it with the Central Bank and, after obtaining exchange settlement certificates, resell them to qualified importers or other qualified clients. This means that anyone holding this foreign exchange cannot directly handle the import of goods. This may not be a suitable way to encourage the repatriation of foreign deposits, as many domestic manufacturers holding these deposits intend to use them to purchase production equipment or raw materials for import, and would not unconditionally remit them back to the country to make uncertain import applications.

Third, the issue of exporters also engaging in imports. According to the regulations, exporters should sell all foreign exchange to designated banks. Although exchange settlement certificates can be freely sold, exporters seeking to handle imports themselves must apply for licenses like other general import traders, without any preferential treatment. Moreover, the validity period of exchange settlement certificates is limited to seven days and cannot be extended, effectively hindering their import business and dampening their enthusiasm for promoting exports.

Fourth, the issue of the exchange settlement deadline for delayed export goods. This deadline is set at three months. Exchange settlement certificates will not be issued for settlements after this period. While the authorities have their reasons, in times of sluggish overseas sales and intense competition in foreign markets, such strict restrictions are akin to forcing distress sales and preventing exporters from waiting for opportunities, which is inconsistent with the goal of promoting imports and exports.

While the above issues cannot be considered shortcomings of the new measures, they represent compromises that are not entirely appropriate. For the sake of "smooth promotion of export goods, bringing overseas Chinese remittances into order, and enriching foreign exchange sources," we still hope for reasonable supplementary measures to expand the anticipated effects. Furthermore, at the beginning of the implementation of these new measures, price levels will inevitably adjust to exchange rates, and considerable fluctuations are unavoidable in the short term. We sincerely hope that merchants and citizens alike recognize the significance of this foreign exchange reform, handle it carefully, and avoid excessive speculation to mitigate the adverse effects of the transition period.

### Advantages of Exchange Settlement Certificates: Can Supplement Deficiencies in the Current Foreign Exchange Measures; Relevant Authorities Answer Various Questions

[This City News] The Central Bank's Circular No. 134 announces the issuance of exchange settlement certificates as a supplementary measure to the current foreign exchange system. A reporter raised several questions, which relevant authorities answered one by one. Today, the questions and answers are detailed below for the benefit of readers:

(1) Question: Why is it necessary to change the original foreign exchange measures?

Answer: The current foreign exchange measures were announced on August 18th of last year. The goal at that time was to bring the foreign exchange rate closer to market prices to facilitate exports and remittances from overseas Chinese. Initially, the results were very satisfactory, with increased exports and inflows of overseas Chinese remittances. However, later, there was a general misunderstanding regarding the relationship between exchange rates and prices, with the belief that exchange rate adjustments would stimulate price increases. Consequently, when prices rose, the Exchange Stabilization Fund's exchange rate could not be adjusted accordingly. The exchange settlement certificate measures announced this time do not represent a fundamental change to the original measures but rather utilize the application of exchange settlement certificates to supplement deficiencies in the original measures, achieving the original goals of the August foreign exchange measures.

Question: Why not fundamentally abolish the current foreign exchange system and adopt free foreign exchange?

Answer: In an environment of continuous price increases, a completely free foreign exchange system is very dangerous. So-called free foreign exchange, when prices are stable, involves unrestricted buying and selling of foreign exchange at a relatively fixed exchange rate. In an environment of continuous price increases, the generally understood concept of free foreign exchange naturally means that the government neither regulates the exchange rate nor restricts the buying and selling of foreign exchange. However, when prices continue to rise, people abandon currency and hoard goods. If foreign exchange is free, some people will certainly hoard foreign exchange instead of goods because foreign exchange is easier to store, without warehousing costs, and easily convertible. Therefore, the demand for foreign exchange will be very high, and the exchange rate will inevitably soar. This soaring exchange rate can naturally stimulate exports, but if the foreign exchange earned from exports is used to satisfy hoarding needs, the national economy does not benefit, and the increase in exchange rates and import/export prices will only fuel general price increases. Some people's concept of free foreign exchange even advocates that the government should not supply foreign exchange for imports at all, forcing importers to seek it directly in the market. Currently, the foreign exchange earned from exports is insufficient for import needs. If the government does not supply foreign exchange at all, the exchange rate will inevitably rise further. This is why a completely free foreign exchange system is not suitable.

(3) Question: Why not adopt a linked import-export system?

Answer: Strictly speaking, a linked import-export system stipulates that after a merchant exports one item, they can exchange it for the import of another. However, because exporters are not necessarily importers, this kind of linkage, except for a few items where finished products can be exchanged for raw materials, is very inconvenient. If exporters can freely transfer the right to import goods to importers, it is not a genuine linked system in reality, and it has the same principle as the current measures. In addition, the import-export linkage system only solves the import and export of goods and cannot solve issues such as remittances, the purchase of foreign currency, and private foreign exchange settlements. This is its shortcoming.

Solving Supply and Demand

(4) Question: Are these measures superior to the original measures, free foreign exchange, and the linked import-export system?

Answer: A. These measures are superior to the original measures. The biggest flaw in the original measures was that the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee's revision of the exchange rate was often criticized, preventing it from keeping pace with prices and adapting to market conditions. The implementation of these measures does not mean that the Exchange Stabilization Fund's exchange rate will no longer be adjusted. However, with exchange settlement certificates, even if the official exchange rate lags behind occasionally, it will not hinder exports and overseas Chinese remittances. The value of exchange settlement certificates is freely determined by market supply and demand, not set by the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Therefore, the criticism of the Fund will not cause the price of exchange settlement certificates to lag behind prices, thereby hindering exports and remittances. Therefore, we say that the application of exchange settlement certificates can supplement the deficiencies of the original measures.

B. These measures have the advantages of free foreign exchange without its disadvantages. The only advantage of free foreign exchange is that the foreign exchange price is determined by the free market and can change with prices. Now that the value of exchange settlement certificates is freely determined by buyers and sellers, the value of exchange settlement certificates is the free market price. Although importers and exporters still settle foreign exchange with designated banks according to the official exchange rate, the actual amount of legal tender received or paid during settlement is the sum of the official exchange rate and the value of the exchange settlement certificate. This amount is determined by the free market. So, in terms of exchange rates, these measures are the same as the generally understood system of free exchange. However, these measures still stipulate that only those who have obtained import licenses and exchange settlement permits can purchase exchange settlement certificates and foreign exchange, preventing certificates and foreign exchange from falling into the hands of speculators. The validity period of exchange settlement certificates is also set at seven days, so even importers and exporters and merchants who have obtained exchange settlement permits cannot pre-purchase and hoard them. These advantages are not possible with a free foreign exchange system. In addition, if the foreign exchange earned from exports and other remittance income is insufficient to meet import needs, causing the value of exchange settlement certificates to soar, the Central Bank can still issue special exchange settlement certificates to supply it, which is also superior to a free foreign exchange system.

C. These measures have the advantages of the linked import-export system without its disadvantages. The advantage of the linked import-export system is that when the exchange rate lags behind prices, the profits from imports can compensate for the losses from exports. The disadvantage is that imports and exports are often not handled by the same merchant, and other foreign exchange transactions cannot be resolved. In reality, any country under any system uses foreign exchange from exports and other income to meet import needs. Now we issue exchange settlement certificates to those who export, remit foreign exchange, and deposit foreign currency, which can be freely resold. We also stipulate that those who import and private individuals who purchase foreign exchange must pay with exchange settlement certificates. This solves all foreign exchange supply and demand simultaneously.

Practical Application

(5) Question: How are exchange settlement certificates actually used?

Answer: When exporters settle foreign exchange with designated banks, the designated bank issues regular exchange settlement certificates on behalf of the Central Bank. When designated banks sell remittances or foreign currency to the Central Bank, the Central Bank issues special exchange settlement certificates. The function of these two types of certificates is the same, except that the former is issued by designated banks to exporters on behalf of the Central Bank, and the latter is issued by the Central Bank to designated banks. Anyone who obtains an import license from the Import Control Committee must pay with the same value of exchange settlement certificates to the designated bank to settle and purchase foreign exchange. For non-import foreign exchange needs, after obtaining a foreign exchange purchase permit, they must also pay with the same value of exchange settlement certificates to purchase foreign exchange. However, the face value of exchange settlement certificates earned from exports may not coincide exactly with the required quantity of a particular foreign exchange need. Therefore, the Central Bank and designated banks can re-divide the certificates they issue into several pieces to suit the needs of those who settle and purchase foreign exchange. Exchange settlement certificates can be freely bought and sold on the market, and the price is freely determined by buyers and sellers. However, only those who have the right to purchase foreign exchange have the right to purchase exchange settlement certificates, to prevent speculation. Each transfer must be endorsed, and if it falls into the hands of someone without the right to purchase foreign exchange even once, that certificate will be invalidated.

Price Constraints

(6) Question: Will the value of exchange settlement certificates rise without restraint?

Answer: This is unlikely to happen. First, the validity period of exchange settlement certificates is only seven days, after which they expire, and only qualified individuals have the right to purchase them, so they cannot be used for speculation. Second, if there are occasional imbalances in supply and demand due to seasonal or other reasons, the Central Bank can also issue special exchange settlement certificates to adjust them.

(7) Question: The validity period of exchange settlement certificates is only seven days. Will its value be deliberately lowered by import traders, disadvantaging export traders?

Answer: This is not a cause for concern, because the owner of an exchange settlement certificate can still sell the certificate to a designated bank at any time, so importers cannot deliberately offer prices that are too low.

(8) Question: Can the implementation of these measures completely solve the issue of overseas Chinese remittances?

Answer: After the implementation of these measures, the benefits of remittances from overseas Chinese will increase, making it less worthwhile to escape into the black market. Because private exchange is always inconvenient and carries the risk of incurring losses. However, some remittances from overseas Chinese will still escape to Hong Kong first. This evasion, in an environment of continuous price increases, cannot be completely avoided unless smuggling is strictly suppressed. However, these measures also provide exchange settlement certificates to those who sell foreign currency to the government, so these Hong Kong dollars and "pass-through certificates" are only temporarily held by private individuals. When they need to use the funds, some of them can still flow back to the Central Bank.

Beneficial to Exports

(9) Question: What is the impact of these measures on the general domestic economy?

Answer: After the implementation of these measures: (A) Due to the increased profits from exports, exports will inevitably increase, and domestic production industries of export goods can also prosper. The current procurement measures are also unnecessary, and export loans can also be reduced, which can reduce administrative burdens. (B) The benefits from imports will be reduced compared to the present, but not to the point of incurring losses, because if the value of exchange settlement certificates is too high, making imports unfavorable, importers will be unwilling to purchase them, and the value will still fall back to the point where imports are profitable. (C) Increased exports, remittances from overseas Chinese, and purchases of foreign currency can increase the government's foreign exchange resources to import more useful materials. (D) When the exchange rate is lower than prices, all price relationships are distorted. From the perspective of factories, imported raw materials and machinery seem very cheap, but in fact, from the perspective of the entire country, they are very expensive. This erroneous cost accounting can lead to uneconomical and wasteful use of materials. The new measures can correct this error, and the freedom in setting the value of exchange settlement certificates can prevent further errors.

(10) Question: Will the implementation of these measures stimulate prices?

Answer: In theory, the implementation of these measures should not stimulate prices. Naturally, due to the increased profits from exports, the price of export goods should increase slightly, which is appropriate given the current situation where export prices are too low. However, even this price increase should not be excessive, because current export prices do not follow the Exchange Stabilization Fund's exchange rate. Due to export procurement and export loans, export prices already exceed the exchange rate, so the rise in the price of export goods will be far less than the value of exchange settlement certificates. As for imports, since current import prices already exceed the Exchange Stabilization Fund's exchange rate by two or three times, the implementation of these measures will not cause them to increase further. There will be no impact on general prices. The fact that exports do not require procurement and that large-scale export loans are not issued can save the government's legal tender expenditure and slow down price increases. As for the long-term price increases caused by inflation, they are unrelated to foreign exchange measures.

### Self-Defense Donations and Pacification Fees: Ministry of Finance Promulgates Collection Measures; Collected Based on People's Wealth and Divided into Grades

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] It is reported that the "Golden Tax Card," abolished ten years ago, will be restored. According to news from the Ministry of Finance: Since the Communist bandits expanded their rebellion, local authorities in various provinces, in response to temporary pacification expenditures, have often added surcharges to national taxes or imposed similar fees on goods, violating laws and hindering people's livelihoods. The Ministry of Finance, to alleviate people's difficulties and rectify the local financial system, has formulated "Measures for Raising Temporary Pacification Fees in Pacification Zones" and "Measures for Raising Special Self-Defense Donations," which have been promulgated and implemented by order of the Executive Yuan. The content is to target people's wealth and collect fees from legal entities or natural persons according to their assets and ability to pay, aiming to make the wealthy contribute more to achieve fairness in the burden. It is also stipulated that no surcharges can be levied on commodity taxes or national taxes.

### Frequent Robberies in Fuzhou

Robbers are Mostly Organized Gangs

Security Authorities are Deeply Troubled

[This Newspaper, Fuzhou, 30th] Robberies have been frequent in the capital of Fujian Province in recent months. No fewer than ten robberies have occurred in the past three days. Victims include Christians, judges, tea merchants, travelers, etc. Most of them are blatant robberies with weapons, breaking into houses, or ambushing in alleys and searching along the way.

### Major Drug Trafficking Case Cracked in Anshun: Total Value Exceeds 740 Billion

The Mastermind Cannot Escape the Blade of Justice

[This Newspaper, Guiyang, 26th, Airstrip News] On the evening of the 18th of this month, a large truck drove into Anshun County on the Yunnan-Guizhou National Highway from Xingyi County (formerly Huangcaoba), a place famous for producing opium. It was fully loaded with opium, totaling thirty-two bamboo-packed bundles. Each bundle contained about 800 taels of opium. After a certain military organization stationed in Anshun learned of this, they conducted an inspection and confiscated all the opium. After this incident occurred, rumors spread. It is also understood that the owner of the goods is currently using a huge sum of 2 billion to lobby all relevant parties. Currently, the price of opium in Guiyang has soared because Gu Zhenglun, after taking office as Provincial Chairman, strictly prohibited opium, with violators being shot without leniency. As a result, the price of opium has risen sharply, from one million yuan per tael to more than three million yuan in the past half month, and it is still difficult to find. These more than 27,000 taels of opium, calculated at the current value, are worth more than 740 billion, making it the largest opium case ever cracked in this province. It is understood that the owners of the goods are all shareholders of a company jointly organized by the gangs of Anshun and Xingyi. It is reported that the provincial government and relevant agencies have paid great attention to this case since its occurrence and have strictly ordered a thorough investigation and report. It is generally expected that in this unprecedented major drug trafficking case, on the eve of the "June 3rd" Opium Prohibition Festival, the masterminds will likely not escape the blade of justice.

Washington Authorities Plan to Make Another Attempt to Break the Deadlock in US-Soviet Relations The Significance of the Soviet Recall of Its Ambassador to the United States [Reuters, Washington, 19th] Sources here increasingly believe that the United States does not want US-Soviet relations to stagnate in the current tense and deadlocked stage, and will soon launch an attempt to hold negotiations with the Soviet Union on some minor issues to test whether an agreement on major issues is possible. Marshall's speech yesterday expressed his belief that "there has been superior progress in stabilizing the world situation according to American standards." This indicates that he believes the United States has won the "Cold War" with the Soviet Union. The first indication that the United States is willing to adjust its relations with the Soviet Union was seen in Marshall's proposal last week to convene a three-power conference to discuss the free navigation of the Danube River. Reston, a diplomatic correspondent for the New York Times, believes that after the Danube River conference, there will inevitably be genuine efforts to resolve the US-Soviet lend-lease debt, the resumption of negotiations on the special port free zone governor, and the resumption of activities of the Berlin Allied Management Committee. It is expected that the United States will raise these issues one by one in the coming months. If Molotov continues to ignore them, then the State Department's assumption that the Soviet Union's response and the publication of Ambassador Smith's confidential notes are purely for propaganda purposes can be confirmed. At that time, the United States will publicize the entire internal situation of US-Soviet diplomacy to show the world the Soviet Union's complete lack of sincerity in improving US-Soviet relations and the overall world situation. [Reuters, Washington, 30th] Moscow's recall of Gromyko, the Soviet representative to the United Nations, and Panyushkin, the Soviet ambassador to the United States, has aroused speculation here that the Kremlin may need the assistance of these two experts on American issues to formulate new plans to break the deadlock in the US-Soviet Cold War. Neutral diplomatic representatives in Washington, especially diplomats from smaller countries, are eagerly hoping that the current relatively quiet state in US-Soviet relations can continue. The most optimistic officials even believe that some balance of power has been established at various points where US and Soviet forces connect. More suspicious people fear that Soviet diplomatic strategists may be deliberately creating a state of silence as a delaying tactic against the establishment of a Western European political and military alliance and the US government's rearmament plans. The US State Department believes that although the Soviet Union seems to have completed consolidating its power in countries within the Iron Curtain, the United States has also improved its position in the past two years, so that Soviet expansion has been temporarily contained. [United Press, London, 30th] The diplomatic correspondent for the "Empire Sunday News" predicts that Molotov may be replaced as Foreign Minister in the near future. The correspondent said that the news came from "authoritative sources" and that Molotov "has lost favor due to the severe setbacks in the Soviet Union's European policy." It was also said that Molotov's successor will be "more acceptable to Western countries and familiar with British and American political situations." Some parties advocate for Gromyko to assume this position. British Special Envoy Visits the US State Department to Discuss the Japanese Peace Conference Issues Deep Concern Over the US Plan to Support Japan [United Press, Washington, 30th] A senior British Far East expert is here to discuss Far East affairs with US officials, especially the issue of the Japanese peace treaty. This person is Denning, the assistant undersecretary in charge of Far East affairs at the British Foreign Office. Before arriving here, he visited India, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada to collect opinions from various countries on the peace conference plan and the US's economic policy toward Japan. It is reported that after Denning's meetings with Under Secretary of State Lovett and others, it is believed that the convening of the Japanese peace conference is still far away. US officials are fully focused on the presidential election and the development of Europe, neglecting the matter of the Japanese peace treaty. It is reported that Lovett told Denning that China, the Soviet Union, and Britain have extremely divergent opinions on the peace conference procedures, and the United States has no intention of actively breaking the deadlock. Informed sources said that Denning told US officials that the British Commonwealth is extremely concerned about the US's plan to restore Japan's industrial level, fearing that its security and economy will be threatened by it. Although Britain is somewhat indifferent, thinking that Japan's industrial recovery is not imminent, Britain believes that the US's inability to explain the content of its plan for Japan has caused unnecessary alarm to other countries. Unless the US puts forward a concrete plan, other countries may not be relieved. Britain is quite surprised and puzzled by the US's unwillingness to actively break the deadlock. The United States originally proposed a two-thirds passing method for the peace conference procedures, but it is reported that the diplomatic community has discovered that the US's position has been shaken, and there are now some signs that the United States may finally agree that the four powers have veto power. It remains unknown whether Britain and its allies are willing to compromise and adopt China's position. After Denning returns to London next week, Britain's attitude on this will likely be discussed. Rumor of Cabinet Reshuffle in Britain Bevin Intends to Retire [Agence France-Presse, London, 30th] According to the socialist newspaper "People's Daily" today, British Foreign Secretary Bevin intends to retire again and is preparing to resign. The newspaper continued that former Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton may succeed him as Foreign Minister. The Sunday Times reported today that there may be personnel changes in the cabinet due to the Arab events. France Denies Requesting Military Guarantees from the US Also Did Not Send a Telegram to the US Calling for an End to the Cold War [Agence France-Presse, Paris, 29th] A French Foreign Office spokesperson firmly denied rumors that the French government would send a telegram to Washington requesting the United States to end the Cold War, requesting military guarantees, or refusing to participate in diplomatic actions that would worsen French-Soviet relations. However, it admitted that the British rumors about these facts did fully express the opinions of the French press. The de Gaulle Faction Opposes the Resolutions of the West German Conference [Reuters, Paris, 30th] It is reported that General de Gaulle will soon launch a powerful movement to oppose France's acceptance of the agreement to be established on Germany's future by the London Six-Nation Conference. Political figures pointed out that the various political factions in France were already feeling uneasy given the Soviet Union's strong reaction to the Six-Nation Conference's decision to establish a West German government. If de Gaulle intervenes again, it will make the French political circles even more chaotic. Currently, the French people have not yet fully recognized the seriousness of the consequences of the London Conference. With the advocacy of the de Gaulle faction, it will inevitably resonate, and even if a cabinet crisis does not occur, Foreign Minister Bidault will inevitably become the target of public criticism and feel uneasy in his position. Turkey Strictly Prevents Foreign Spies from Sneaking In [Reuters, Ankara, 29th] The Turkish government has ordered border soldiers and civilians to strictly prevent foreign spies from sneaking into Turkish territory. The authorities ordered people living on the border to pay close attention to "the danger of the Communist Party." It is rumored here that underground group members from Azerbaijan, Syria, and Iraq are sneaking into Turkey. One person holding maps and propaganda materials has already been captured in Alexandretta on the Syrian-Turkish border. Communist Party Controls the Czech Republic Yesterday in the General Election People Vote in the Rain [Reuters, Prague, 30th] The first general election under the new Czech regime began this morning. Prague Radio announced that voters in the Prague city area were not deterred by the rain, but the number of voters in areas outside Prague decreased due to the heavy rain. The radio also stated that no riots occurred throughout the country this morning. The election results will not be announced until some time later, but there is little doubt that all Communist Party candidates will be elected. [Reuters, London, 30th] On the eve of the Czech general election, 48 key members of the country's embassy in London resigned simultaneously to protest the Czech government's method of preparing for the election. South Korean Parliament Opens Today Most of the 198 Members Arrive in Seoul The Congress Will Elect the President and Draft the Constitution [Reuters, Seoul, 30th] South Korea's new legislative assembly is scheduled to convene its first meeting on the morning of the 31st. The venue will be the former site of the Japanese Governor-General of Korea's Office, opposite the ancient Goryeo palace. Officials from the US military government and consular representatives from China, Britain, France, and the United States will all be present to observe the ceremony. Although the Soviet Union has a military liaison group stationed in Seoul, the Soviet representative will not be present. The United Nations Korean Commission has gone to Shanghai to draft a report on its mission in Korea and will not be able to have senior officials present to observe the ceremony. The primary tasks of the legislative assembly include electing the president and considering the drafting of the constitution. The presidential post will almost certainly be held by Syngman Rhee. Most of the 198 members of parliament have arrived in Seoul. Due to the unrest in the countryside, the authorities are still providing special protection to the members of parliament. The elections on Jeju Island were declared invalid due to terrorist disruptions and will be re-elected separately. If North Korea can unite with South Korea, the number of members of the legislative assembly is expected to increase by 100 to a total of 300. "Molotov" Cocktail Originally Published in the American Daily News The Security Council Passes British Resolution Armistice between Arabs and Jews for Four Weeks Arms Embargo to the Holy Land and the Arab League during the Armistice [Reuters, Lake Success, 30th] On the 29th, the United Nations Security Council passed an order for Jewish and Arab armies to cease fire for four weeks, and decided to prohibit the supply of weapons and ammunition to Palestine and the Arab League countries during these four weeks. Jewish and Arab representatives here have tentatively reserved their attitudes towards this resolution of the Security Council, but it is generally expected that the Jews and Arabs can be expected to give a positive response. The main points of the amended resolution passed by the Security Council include: (1) A four-week ceasefire; (2) A ban on combatants entering Palestine during this period; or Jewish people of conscription age in the Arab League countries may not receive military training during this period; (3) A ban on the import of arms into Palestine or the Arab League countries during this period. The resolution also stipulates that if the belligerents violate the order of the Security Council, the entire situation in Palestine will be re-examined in order to take military and economic sanctions. The important amendment proposed by the US delegation to the case, ordering both the Jewish and Arab sides to notify the Security Council by 10:00 pm standard time on June 1 that it has accepted its resolution, was also passed. The US amendment also emphasized that if either party refuses the new resolution of the Security Council, the Security Council may consider taking direct action under Chapter VII of the Charter in order to use military force to correct any "threats to peace, breaches of peace, and acts of aggression." When the case was put to a vote, it was voted on item by item. Colombia abstained from all votes, while the Soviet Union and Ukraine abstained from all items except for one item on the ceasefire, which they also voted in favor of. Another item in the case, on the protection of Palestinian relics, was voted in favor of by the entire body. The Soviet Proposal Was Rejected Before the vote on the case, another resolution proposed by the Soviet Union, stipulating that sanctions should be imposed if a ceasefire is not implemented within 36 hours, was rejected because it did not obtain a two-thirds majority. Six countries, including Britain, abstained from the vote. The Soviet Union Accuses the Arabs of Not Fighting for Themselves British Officers Participate in Jewish Surrender Negotiations [Central News Agency, London, 29th, United Press] Moscow Radio claimed: Although the Soviet people sympathize with the Arab national liberation movement, they believe that Arab aggression against Jews is inappropriate. The broadcast quoted the words of the Truth Daily, saying: The Arab countries are wrong to oppose the establishment of a Jewish state, which was established in accordance with the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly. The Soviet Union has always defended the independence of the Arab peoples and will continue to defend it in the future. It should be recognized that the Arabs are not fighting for their own national interests in opposing the new Jewish state. [United Press, London, 30th] Moscow Radio broadcast a TASS dispatch from Tel Aviv saying that during the surrender negotiations for the Old City of Jerusalem, "more than a dozen people witnessed" three British officers in Arab Legion uniforms participating in the negotiations. "The Voice of Israel Radio" stated that although Britain claimed that it would withdraw British officers from the Legion, three British officers still participated in Arab military operations and participated in negotiations. Cloth Made from Peanuts [Associated Press, London, 30th] The government has approved the British Chemical Industry Company's plan to make cloth from peanuts. This new fiber is called "Ardil." The raw materials will be supplied by the peanut factory currently being established in East Africa. Miracle in a British Church Roses Do Not Wither for a Long Time Huaming News Agency, London: In St. Mary's Church in Stockport, near Manchester, the 22 roses placed on the Virgin's crown more than a year ago have not withered to this day, which has caused worldwide amazement. The flower crown was offered to the church's Virgin by an 80-year-old believer, Ms. Byrne, last May. This May, she still placed a flower crown made of 17 fresh roses on top of the flower crown she offered last year. Believers from all over Britain have come from afar to visit this ceremony. Amount of Chinese Tungsten Sand Exported to the United States [Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] The US Department of Commerce announced: The United States imported a total of 1,054 short tons of tungsten sand, which is exclusively for consumption in the first three months of this year. Among them, 690 tons came from China, accounting for 65% of the total imports. In addition, China exported another 870 tons of tungsten sand to the United States, making the total amount of tungsten sand currently in warehouses for future consumption or transshipment reach 1,538 short tons. It is said that in the first three months, domestic production of tungsten sand decreased by 7%, imports decreased by 54%, and the approved consumption volume remained high, causing storage volume to decrease. Bulgaria and Poland Sign a 20-Year Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance [Reuters, London, 29th] Moscow Radio Report: The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Bulgaria and Poland was signed in Warsaw today by the prime ministers and foreign ministers of the two countries. The treaty is valid for 20 years and stipulates that both parties agree to take all usable methods to prevent aggression by Germany or its allies, and that in the event of such aggression, the signatory countries will provide each other with military assistance. Both parties also agreed not to participate in any alliances or actions against each other. The treaty also stipulates that in international forums, the two countries should engage in close cooperation on issues related to the interests of either signatory country, especially on issues related to peace, security, and territorial integrity. Egyptian Army Occupies the City of Isdud, Only Twenty Miles Away from the Jewish Capital Rumor that the Iraqi Army's Vanguard is Eight Miles from the Mediterranean Coast [Reuters, London, 30th] The most intense fighting in Palestine continues in the Latrun area on the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway line, fifteen miles west of Jerusalem. The Jewish army dispatched armored vehicles and aircraft to attack the Arab army's defense line in Latrun in order to aid the besieged Jewish army in the new urban area of Jerusalem, while the Arab side also transferred reinforcements from Ramla to assist in the battle. In the new urban area of Jerusalem, the Arab Legion, after occupying the Old City, has shifted its artillery fire and concentrated on bombarding the Jewish strongholds in the new city. A Jewish army spokesperson in Tel Aviv pointed out that the Arab army is using incendiary bombs with pity, hoping to turn most of the areas in the new urban area of Jerusalem into a sea of fire. A New York radio report, by a CBS reporter, stated that the Arab allied forces are advancing towards Tel Aviv in a pincer formation. The Iraqi army advancing from the central plains of Palestine has occupied the village of Kiryat, fifteen miles from Tel Aviv, and the vanguard is only eight miles from the Mediterranean coast. If this news is true, the Jewish nation may be cut into two sections, leaving the Jewish area in northern Palestine isolated. According to a communiqué from the Cairo Army Command, the Egyptian army advancing along the Gaza-Tel Aviv coastal highway has occupied the city of Isdud, twenty-one miles north of Gaza, which is only twenty miles from Tel Aviv. The Annual Moral Rearmament Conference is Scheduled to Open on Wednesday Sixteen Countries Invited to Participate [Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] Seventy-seven US congressmen jointly invited 16 countries (including China) to participate in the 10th annual meeting of the Moral Rearmament Conference in Hollywood on June 2. The conference advocates preparing for ideological warfare. The telegram stated: The increasingly developing world situation makes the technical aspects of ideological warfare incomparably important. This kind of war requires the governments and people of all countries to receive strict training. It should be emphasized that economic assistance is fundamental for world recovery, and military strength is also necessary. But without the power of a superior theory, economic and military power are not the solution. [Associated Press, Tokyo, 30th] Former Ambassador to the United States Kenkichi Horiuchi and eight other Japanese people flew to the United States today, accompanied by Methodist teacher Hager from the United States, to attend the Moral Rearmament Conference. Evolution of the British Administrative System in Recent Years By Our Correspondent in Britain, Saben Keng The British administrative system is mostly a product of history. It changes with changes in the environment and has great flexibility. The purpose of this article is to explain the current situation and trends of the British administrative system in recent years. Naturally, the scope included in the administrative system is very large, and what this article can involve is only its main part. (1) We start with the organization of the cabinet. The cabinet is the core of the British administrative structure. Between World War I and World War II, the British peacetime cabinet usually had between 20 and 22 people. Except for the French cabinet in recent years, which occasionally expanded to accommodate people from all walks of life, there are few cabinets of the same nature in the world with such a large number of people. In August 1939, on the eve of the war, the British cabinet had a total of 23 cabinet members, including the Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord President of the Council, Lord Chancellor, Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary, Lord Privy Seal, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Secretary of State for Colonial Affairs, Secretary of State for India, Secretary of State for War, Secretary of State for Air, Secretary of State for Scotland, First Lord of the Admiralty, Minister for Coordination of Defence, President of the Board of Trade, Minister of Health, Minister of Labour, Minister of Transport, Minister of Supply, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, and President of the Board of Education. Apart from the First Commissioner of Works, Postmaster General, and Minister of Pensions, who have always been regarded as the "lower" among the "ministers," almost all "ministerial" personnel are included in the cabinet. At the beginning of World War II, Chamberlain organized a wartime cabinet, which included nine people, namely the Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Foreign Secretary, First Lord of the Admiralty, Secretary of State for War, Secretary of State for Air, Lord Privy Seal, Minister for Coordination of Defence, and a Minister without Portfolio. Churchill's wartime cabinet always had between 5 and 10 cabinet members, and in fact, no more than 9 were normally in London, one of whom often went abroad with the title of cabinet member. At the same time, the wartime cabinet during World War II had a significant difference from the wartime cabinet during World War I. The wartime cabinet members during World War I, except for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, were mostly ministers without portfolio. But this time it was not the case. After the end of the war against Germany, Churchill organized a "caretaker government" to hold general elections. At this time, the cabinet expanded to 16 people. As a result of the general election, Attlee organized a cabinet with 20 people, but it was reduced to 17 people during a partial reorganization last winter. This January, with Burma becoming a self-governing dominion, the Secretary of State for Burma no longer exists, so the cabinet was reduced by one person again to 16 people. These 16 people include the Prime Minister, Lord President of the Council, Foreign Secretary, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Privy Seal, President of the Board of Trade, Minister of Defence, Lord Chancellor , Home Secretary, Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Secretary of State for Colonial Affairs, Scottish Secretary, Minister of Labour, Minister of Education, Minister of Health, and Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. In addition to these 16 people, there are 15 other "cabinet-level ministers" who are not "in the cabinet" in fact. These 15 people are First Lord of the Admiralty, Secretary of State for War, Secretary for Air, Minister of Supply, Minister of Fuel and Power, Minister of Transport, Minister of Food, Minister of State, Minister of Pensions, Minister of Works, Minister for Town and Country Planning, Minister of National Insurance, Minister of Civil Aviation, Postmaster General, and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. (Note: Some of the above ministers were newly established or changed during the war, so their names and numbers are not exactly the same as the 1939 ministers.) The reason why all ministers cannot be completely "in the cabinet" is naturally to prevent the cabinet from having too many people. As for who should be in the cabinet and who does not have to be in the cabinet, the selection criteria include many things, but the inclusion of the Lord Privy Seal and the Lord Chancellor in the cabinet is largely for historical reasons. (2) As mentioned above, it can be seen that there is a tendency for the number of cabinet members to decrease. At least, if compared with the increase in administrative departments, the cabinet has formed an organization above the administrative departments, rather than a comprehensive body of administrative departments. Not only that, but in the present, the British cabinet actually has a core. This core includes several of the most important cabinet members, becoming the inner cabinet of the cabinet. At present, this core generally includes four or five people, namely Prime Minister Attlee, Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps, Lord President of the Council Morrison, Foreign Secretary Bevin, and possibly Minister of Defence Alexander. The fact that the cabinet has another core seems to have existed for a long time, but now it is even more obvious. The reason why the Lord President of the Council has become an important position is not for the Council itself, but for the Lord President of the Council concurrently serving as the chairman of the Cabinet's Economic Committee. Although it does not concurrently serve as this chairman now, the Lord President of the Council has acquired the powers related to coordinating social affairs that were previously managed by the Lord Privy Seal, and may soon concurrently serve as the chairman of the Cabinet's Legislative Committee. In addition, it is the leader of the government party in the House of Commons, thus making its important position. This trend of the cabinet gradually shrinking, judging from the situation where the cabinet was produced by the Privy Council in British history, there may be a small cabinet in the future. Of course, there are some shortcomings in the fact that administrative heads cannot all participate in the cabinet. The current remedy is to allow these administrative ministers who are not in the cabinet to participate in the cabinet committees related to their departments, and can also be invited to attend when the cabinet meeting discusses matters specifically related to a certain administrative minister who is not in the cabinet. (3) The above is an explanation of the cabinet itself. In terms of administrative departments, there are also some quite important changes. The first is the increase in the number of administrative departments. Since 1939, the increase in British administrative departments has been quite drastic, but the situation is also quite complicated. The first type is those that were added during the war and have now been abolished. For example, the Ministry of Production, Ministry of Information, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Aircraft Production, Ministry of Home Security, etc. The second type is those that were newly added during the war and still exist now, such as the Ministry of Fuel and Power, Ministry of Supply, Ministry of Food, Ministry of National Insurance, Ministry of Civil Aviation, and Ministry of Town and Country Planning. The third is those that have been reorganized from existing institutions in recent years, such as the Board of Education, which was changed to the Ministry of Education after the passage of the 1944 Education Act. Of course, the second category mentioned above may be considered more important. War often causes changes in administrative institutions. In British history, the army was originally managed by the Home Secretary, but in 1794, due to the war against France, the Secretary of State for War was appointed. In the early 19th century, colonial affairs were originally managed by the Secretary of State for War, but in 1854, in order to reduce the heavy responsibilities borne by the Secretary of State for War in the Crimean War, a Secretary of State for the Colonies was appointed separately. The Ministry of Air, Labour, and Transport were all established during World War I. Most of the departments established during this war that still exist now are also related to peacetime work. Perhaps we can say that war often leads to the establishment of new institutions, but some of these new institutions have long been needed, and the need becomes particularly prominent during wartime, so they are established. Second, the tendency

Letter to the Editor
Regarding the dispute between soldiers and tram workers on Chengdu Road the day before yesterday, we have received a letter from the New Recruit Brigade of the 205th Division of the Army, which is transcribed as follows: "At about 6 pm on the 29th, five new recruits from our brigade, including Cui Qinglin, were waiting at the Sino-French Pharmacy stop for the No. 19 trolleybus. The bus, which was full of soldiers (returning from watching a play at the Gongwutai Theater), did not stop when it arrived at the stop and drove away. Cui and others ordered it to stop, but the conductor not only did not stop, but also ridiculed our soldiers for not wearing hats and symbols, calling them a bandit unit. The trolleybus had already left, and Cui and others had to wait for the bus to return. When the bus returned, the soldiers had a quarrel with the conductor, which led to a fight. Traffic was immediately cut off, and dozens of trolleybuses and more than 200 workers surrounded and beat Cui and the other four soldiers. Soldiers from the Fifth Company stationed at Xiyuan Temple discovered this and tried to resolve the situation peacefully, but the workers ignored them and used ticket clippers to injure soldier Cui Qinglin's left hand, causing a group fight. At this time, Chen, the duty officer of the Fifth Company, feared that the matter would escalate, and immediately ordered the soldiers to enter the barracks and closed the front and rear gates. Unexpectedly, the workers surrounded the Xiyuan Temple and used stones and iron bars to smash the windows and doors of the temple. At this time, military police and the brigade commander of our headquarters arrived, and the workers used a strike to pressure the brigade commander to restore traffic as soon as possible. The brigade commander, bearing the humiliation, sent the offending soldiers to the New City Branch Bureau for interrogation. It was found that the soldiers were recruited from the disaster area, were out-of-school and unemployed youth, and were trained in Taiwan. They had no weapons. Secondly, the conductor Yang Qi was not detained in the company headquarters. There was no such thing, and it was said that the youth used stones to throw down from the high place, which was not the case.”

General Prices: Grain Prices Rise Sharply, Other Fluctuations Narrow
General prices, after experiencing a sharp rise in the first two weeks of May, had already slowed down in the previous week. Last week continued this trend, showing stability, seemingly entering a lull period between cyclical price increases. At the same time, the authorities strengthened market controls on the one hand and continued to sell goods to tighten credit on the other. In addition, the new premier has been announced, and there may be changes in the government's important economic measures, causing major players on both the long and short sides to be wary, and therefore temporarily adopting a wait-and-see attitude.
Under these circumstances, the trend of various commodities, except for grains, which rose sharply due to the approaching period of food scarcity and rising production costs, mostly hovered steadily, with only slight fluctuations and a narrow range. Judging from the price index classified by purpose compiled by this publication, the overall index rose by 5.88 percent last week. Although the exchange situation of national banks last week varied, due to the influx of floating capital from North and Central China into Shanghai, it is estimated that the amount of funds flowing into Shanghai from Tuesday to Thursday reached more than 1.6 trillion, so credit was quite loose, and underground interest rates frequently declined, falling from around 0.30 to 0.27 by the end of the week. The Hong Kong exchange rate was quite stable throughout the process, fluctuating between 0.46 and 0.48. The relevant price factors for each item last week are briefly analyzed as follows:
First, the authorities continued to implement the policy of selling goods to tighten credit. On Monday, in addition to the usual sale of yarn and cloth, the Textile Construction Company auctioned 14 types of cotton yarn on behalf of the Yarn Control Committee, selling 1,177 pieces, and three types of cotton, selling 2,450 dan. The Civil Affairs Commission sold 6,000 shi of rice, with an allocated price of 5.6 million per shi. Rice merchants added a deposit of 100,000, totaling 5.7 million, stipulating that the retail price per shi should not exceed the limit of 6 million. On Tuesday, the Textile Construction Company auctioned nine types of cotton yarn on behalf of the Yarn Control Committee, selling 418 pieces. The Civil Affairs Commission sold a total of 6,000 shi of rice in the north and south markets, with no change in price. Taiwan Sugar Company allocated the 22nd batch of sugar as usual, with the quantity increased by 50%, and the allocated price remained unchanged from the previous period. On Wednesday, the Yarn Control Committee stopped auctioning. The Civil Affairs Commission continued to sell as usual, but because the allocated rice was Wuhu indica rice, the number of applicants was not enthusiastic. On Thursday, the Civil Affairs Commission sold as usual, with a total of 6,000 shi of rice sold in the north and south markets. On Friday, the Textile Construction Company sold four types of cotton on behalf of the Yarn Control Committee, selling a total of 5,000 dan. The Civil Affairs Commission sold 3,000 shi of rice, with no change in the allocated price.
Second, the strengthening of controls. (1) Mayor Wu, due to the continuous rise in rice prices, which greatly affected the future of people's food, summoned representatives of rice merchants in the city, including Qu Zhenhua, on Monday morning to discuss and announced new measures to suppress rice prices, stipulating that the retail price should not exceed the limit of 6 million per shi, and instructed the police bureau to strictly investigate the market situation. Subsequently, the Economic Police Brigade found 19 rice stores exceeding the limit price on Monday and Tuesday and took the responsible persons to the bureau for questioning. The rice industry association bailed them out and guaranteed that they would not exceed the limit price in the future. (2) The Yarn Control Committee, in order to handle violations, and with the purpose of establishing special responsibility, established a committee to review violations on Thursday with the approval of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. (3) According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Food, "The current government, in order to prevent the soaring rice prices in Beijing and Shanghai, restricts the transportation of rice out of the urban areas, so as to prevent grain merchants in Beijing and Shanghai from purchasing allocated rice, secretly transporting and hoarding for profit, and to prevent grain merchants from competing to purchase and stimulate grain prices, which is an effective method. As for strictly prohibiting hoarding and speculation, the Ministry has separately promulgated implementation measures, which have been handed over to the local governments for implementation, among which the most important are open price negotiation, the elimination of the black market, strict prohibition of speculative floating capital, and prohibition of the use of warehouse receipts for repeated trading." (4) It is reported that as a result of the Financial Management Bureau's investigation of the bounced check trend, it has been found that two banks and Zhuang indeed used bounced checks to make up for their own shortcomings. The bureau has ordered the two banks and Zhuang to replace the responsible personnel and rectify their business, and has also ordered the various industry associations to inform their members.
Last week, with the sound of cabinet formation, rumors of reform were rife regarding the government's important economic measures.
First, regarding the current foreign exchange and trade policy, after the new Governor of the Central Bank, Yu Hongjun, took office, he first invited Chen Guangfu, the current Chairman of the Balancing Committee, to talk. Subsequently, Chairman Huo of the Export Management Committee and Deputy Director Shao of the Business Bureau of the National Bank went to Beijing to report to the authorities on the past management situation. As a result, market rumors abounded. Some said that foreign exchange would be liberalized, some said that the Balancing Committee would be abolished, and some said that an import and export sales system would be adopted. We can wait quietly for the facts to answer how it will develop in the future.
Second, in order to strengthen the absorption of floating capital and stabilize the market and finance, the National Bank has made new decisions on the policy of short-term treasury bills. According to the National Bank authorities, (1) since the issuance of short-term treasury bills, there has been a proposal to promote them in the five major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Chongqing. The National Bank has now decided on this plan and notified the five branch offices in those areas on Friday to issue them from the date of receipt of the order. The issuance method will be the same as in Shanghai, but the discount range will be determined by the branch offices themselves. (2) Since the issuance of one-month short-term treasury bills on April 30, as of Friday, 2.5 trillion has been sold. (3) Starting next week, in addition to the three types of one-month treasury bills issued as usual, two-month treasury bills will be added, and the securities exchange and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will be entrusted to trade them in the open market. The face value of the treasury bills will be divided into 10 million, 50 million, 100 million, 500 million, and 1 billion, five types. These treasury bills are divided into two types, A and B. Type A is a spot transaction, and delivery will be made before 12 noon on the second day after the transaction. Type B will be delivered before 11 noon on the third day after the transaction.
The trend of market prices last week was most prominent in the rise of building materials and food. The prices of other commodities, generally speaking, were mostly weak from Monday to Thursday. After Friday, there was a trend of becoming firm again. This is because the government's sale of goods gradually became scarce, and floating capital from other places flowed into Shanghai, so the pressure was still insufficient.
Chinese stocks frequently trended downward from the beginning of the week. For example, Yongsha closed at only 2,685 on Wednesday. After Friday, there was some buying on dips, and market sentiment turned upbeat. Foreign stocks showed signs of recovery due to the authorities' strict crackdown on illegal trading and the stability of the Hong Kong exchange rate.
In terms of yarn and cloth, prices were generally weak at the beginning of the week due to the sale of goods by the Yarn Control Committee. At the end of the week, prices became firm as the sale of goods gradually became scarce. For example, 42-count Blue Phoenix closed at 300 million on Tuesday and returned to 315 million on Friday. The trend of coarse yarn was relatively stable, with very little rise and fall. Fine yarn and fine cloth hovered around 7 million.
Grain prices rose sharply. Due to the suppression of price limits in the market, transactions were suspended several times. The quoted price of white japonica rice outside the market broke the 7 million mark after Friday. Grains, oils, and flours saw slight fluctuations, and the trend was relatively stable.
Daily necessities such as soap and matches saw prices rise slowly due to solid sales. Guben Soap stood at 7.17 million on Friday, and Meili Matches stood at 34 million on Friday. In addition, building materials also rose sharply, with an average increase of nearly 20% compared to the previous week. Chemicals and metals saw very little fluctuation, with small ranges of volatility.

Monetary Finance (1) Credit and underground interest rates
Last week, the authorities remained committed to tightening credit in this city and spared no effort. According to the financial authorities, credit will not be loosened until US aid arrives. This shows the government's good intentions. However, as is well known, "wanting to tighten credit" is only a subjective wish. Whether credit can be tightened on schedule is an objective fact. Selling goods is one of the available methods for tightening credit. However, fighting against the huge torrent of currency with limited goods and amounts must go through a severe test before the effect of selling goods can be accurately demonstrated. In addition, measures such as the prohibition of using same-day notes as collateral, which will be implemented on June 1, although it can greatly reduce the flexibility of banks and Zhuang's capital turnover for a time, if the payment of banks and Zhuang is mostly replaced by bank drafts in the future, then this other method of tightening credit will inevitably be greatly discounted. Furthermore, if the financial sector experiences turmoil due to cyclical "turnover" panic, then from the perspective of stabilizing the market, it may not be a new crisis. The results of this move are unpredictable.
Last week, signs have already foreshadowed that the "tightening" of credit cannot withstand the power of floating capital "converging" in this city. Not only did floating capital from North and Central China return one after another last week, but there was also a phenomenon of capital flowing back from South China. Cash chips in the market are extremely abundant, and interbank supply orders are also more due to the wait-and-see attitude of all parties towards the current situation than demand orders, resulting in the stagnation of interbank lending.
From Monday to Friday, the exchange differences of national banks and bureaus reached a total of 402.78 billion. If the fixed deposits of commercial banks submitted to the central bank during the period, totaling 289 billion, are not counted, then the actual difference of banks and bureaus is only 113.78 billion, a decrease of 81.64 billion compared to the previous week. The exchange differences of foreign banks totaled 140.73 billion in five days, a decrease of 51.65 billion compared to the same period in the previous week. Exchange banks and Zhuang after No. 60 differed a total of 322.28 billion from Monday to Friday, which is similar to the amount differed from the previous week. As for the cash that banks and Zhuang remitted to the central bank during the week, the number was more than 200 billion, which was still several billion more than the previous week. The abundance of cash chips can be seen from this.
Underground interest rates were higher on Monday, with some reaching 0.33. Before the middle of the week, it generally stood at 0.30. Later, due to the abundant supply of funds and the lack of demand, it fell to 0.27. The interest subsidy outside the securities market was mostly 41 yuan for the long side on Monday, and 37 yuan per share for the short side. From Wednesday to Friday, it has also fallen to the level of 30 yuan and 26 yuan.
(2) Internal and external exchange rates
The foreign exchange market last week was flat and weak due to the unsettled political situation and the wait-and-see attitude of the people. Although the market price of the US exchange benchmark rate was quite far from the black market price, because the central authorities were arranging personnel and had no time to revise policies, although the export industry frequently called for the arrival of the crisis, no changes were seen. Financial items were generally sluggish. The Hong Kong gold price was 319.5 Hong Kong dollars per tael at the end of the previous week. It rose to 325.5 yuan on Monday of last week, and then continued to decline, rising slightly to 326.5 yuan on Thursday. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 0.46 Hong Kong dollars for 10,000 legal tender at the end of the previous week, and remained unchanged on Thursday of last week. The market price of US dollars in Hong Kong fluctuated slightly between 5.4 and 4.5.
In the internal exchange market, the exchange rates in South China generally decreased last week. The Guangzhou exchange rate was 40 yuan from Monday to Thursday and fell to 20 yuan on Friday. Although the Xiamen exchange rate once rose from 150 yuan to 180 yuan on Wednesday, it continued to decline afterwards, reaching 140 yuan on Friday. The Hankou exchange rate in Central China also fell from 50 yuan on Monday to 20 yuan on Friday. Although the Tianjin discount in North China was stable at 100 yuan from Monday to Thursday, it rose again to 110 yuan on Friday. The above trend shows that floating capital from North and Central China continues to flow south, and there is also a temporary phenomenon of floating capital flowing back to this city from South China.
(3) Chinese and foreign stock markets
At the beginning of this week, due to the large amount of cash collected by national banks and bureaus, and the floating capital from the north had not arrived, credit suddenly turned tight. The Chinese stock market was very depressed, and Yongsha hovered around 3,030 yuan for a long time. Other stocks rose first and then weakened, falling consistently. At the final close, Yongsha fell to 2,855 yuan. Xinguo was 945 yuan, and Xinguang was only 37.5 yuan.
The next day, credit turned from tight to stable, because a large amount of cash was transported from North China and Central China, but Chinese stocks were still unable to rise. Because the end of the month was approaching, people were depressed, and the authorities tightened controls, Yongsha continued to shrink, breaking into the 2,700 mark. Other stocks fell together, becoming softer and softer, and the result was a general decline.
On Wednesday, due to rumors of Weng's cabinet formation, people were concerned about the new policy measures and were unsure. Chinese stocks also showed a vague attitude, falling in a roundabout way. Yongsha was as low as 2,675 yuan, and the transaction was bleak.
On Thursday, because credit had become loose, Chinese stocks gradually stabilized, but the market was still weak, with only 1.2 billion shares traded. The rise and fall of Yongsha in one day was only a few tens of yuan.
On Friday, credit was extremely loose, and the external market reported gains. Yongsha rose slightly, closing at 2,785 yuan, and other stocks also turned from weakness to strength. Xinguo was 915 yuan. Xinguang was 34.70 yuan.
At the weekend, because the end of the month was approaching, retail investors had no intention of staying, and large investors rarely absorbed them, and they mostly remained in a weak state. Yongsha closed at 2,700.
At the beginning of the week, the foreign stock market was soft due to the stability of the Hong Kong exchange rate and the tightening of credit for financial items. Yisha also trended downward from high levels, falling to 5.2 million yuan. Yinglian was 5.55 million yuan, and Huidefeng was 11.5 million yuan, all lower than the previous week.
On Tuesday, the Hong Kong exchange rate was reported to be stable, the black market disappeared, Chinese stocks fell sharply, and credit was still tight. Yisha fell sharply to 5.08 million yuan, Yinglian was still flat, and Huidefeng was 10.8 million yuan. Other stocks such as Yeguang, Beer, and Shipping also fell one after another.
On Wednesday, because various items in the foreign market were weak, the foreign stock market also showed a stagnant situation. Yisha fell back to 5.03 million yuan, Yinglian was 5.3 million yuan, and Huidefeng was 10.6 million yuan, all weak.
On Thursday, because the Hong Kong exchange rate was stable, the market was the reverse, and transactions were very scarce. Yisha fell back to 4.68 million yuan, Yinglian was 5.1 million yuan, and Huidefeng was 10.1 million yuan, all falling continuously.
On Friday, there was another decline. Because the end of the month was approaching, and the problem of using same-day notes as collateral was encountered, interest was waning, and transactions were also scarce. Yisha continued to fall to 4.58 million yuan, Yinglian knocked on the 5 million yuan mark, and Huidefeng fell to 9.8 million.
At the weekend, it was still in a weak state. Yisha fell first and then rebounded, closing at 4.52 million yuan, Yinglian rose slightly, Huidefeng was up by a small ten thousand yuan, Yeguang, Steel were flat, and other stocks had few transactions and prices were also flat.
Industrial and Commercial Dynamics: The Struggle with Controlled Forces and External Forces
Since the promulgation of the new import exchange settlement measures and the widening gap between the market exchange rate and the black market exchange rate, the industrial and commercial circles in this city, especially the import and export industry, have been in a state of panic. For example, according to industry insiders, the export of straw hats has been reduced by one-half compared to before the war due to the influence of foreign exchange rates and government control. It is reported that the situation of more than 100 handkerchief industries is also becoming increasingly difficult. The amount of raw materials allocated by the Textile Construction Company is only 40% of what is needed. If the news released by the United Society on the 22nd that the United States requires aid-receiving countries to temporarily suspend ordering cotton is implemented, then the shortage of raw materials will not be limited to the handkerchief industry alone. The shortage of raw materials and the difficulty of exporting have caused the handkerchief industry to reduce production across the board. Those who used to work day and night have now stopped night work, and the difficult situation can be imagined. As for the underwear industry, according to news from the Economic Daily on the 23rd, because both domestic and foreign sales have fallen, more than half of the dozen or so manufacturers in this city are in a state of semi-shutdown, and larger factories are also reducing production every day. The China Cotton Textile Industry Production and Sales Joint Company also submitted a request to the authorities for relief last week due to the problem of export exchange settlement and import of raw materials. Furthermore, the export of casings has recently been unable to export due to the rising price of pork and the too low market exchange rate, which is nearly 70% different from foreign market prices. The export of bristles has always been a major export of our country. According to a report on the 28th, it has also been unable to be exported due to rising domestic prices and the large gap between the foreign exchange rate and the black market. If this situation continues, it can only be like tung oil, changing from private to state-owned. All of this foretells that the export industry is in extreme decline, and the inevitable result will be a sharp reduction in export exchange settlement. As for why the export exchange settlement figures for May showed a significant increase, according to news from the Import and Export Association, most of them were export exchange settlements handled by state-owned institutions, so they are not enough to represent an improvement in exports. From this point of view, if trade and foreign exchange policies cannot be improved for a while in the future, then private export industries will either be given to state-owned industries, or they will have to move to Hong Kong and other places. This publication has also reported on this in the previous issue.
To rescue exports, the Municipal Import and Export Association held a board of directors meeting on the 21st and decided to launch a committee to organize an export rescue movement, and to hold an "Export Week" from June 14th to 21st to expand publicity and solicit participation from all walks of life. As for the National Bank's Announcement No. 131 regarding the new import exchange settlement measures, it requested that the order be withdrawn. Furthermore, the International Trade Promotion Association also opposed the National Bank's Announcement No. 131 and regarded it as a disguised form of excessive taxation. As for the Industrial Association, it has also repeatedly convened meetings and dispatched representatives to request the relevant authorities to improve the exchange settlement methods. In addition, in order to stop the dumping of Japanese goods in the South China area, the China National Products Manufacturers Association sent telegrams to the relevant authorities and legal entities in various places on the 21st to strictly prevent the dumping of Japanese goods and encourage the Chinese people to use domestic goods. The various dynamics of the industrial and commercial circles can illustrate that a kind of organized collective force is being formed by national industry and commerce, to repeatedly fight against the domestic controlled forces and the emerging external forces!
However, one wave has not subsided, and another wave has risen. In order to implement the international trade tax reduction agreement of 22 countries, the Jianghai Customs first reduced the import tax rate of American goods by 30% to 50% from May 21st, and the import surtax was also cancelled at the same time. It is reported that the industrial and commercial circles in this city attach great importance to this. The Industrial Association believes that if the tax reduction items belong to industrial raw materials and industrial equipment, then it can indeed alleviate the difficulties of the industrial circles, but if the tax reduction is for finished products, it is tantamount to helping the massive import of foreign goods, and the national industry will become more difficult. However, the Ministry of Finance spokesman believes that the implementation of tariff concessions is more beneficial than harmful to China. The reasons are roughly that the scope of tax reduction is not large, and the maximum reduction rate is for metals and their products, followed by food and beverages, and then chemical products and dyes, so the impact on the national light industry is not large, etc. But whether the result of the tax reduction is more beneficial than harmful or more harmful than beneficial remains to be proven by facts!
The National Bank's Rediscount Committee Begins Operations
It is found that the National Bank's loan policy this year was previously agreed by the Four-Bank Joint Office as two major items: national policy loans and business loans. Except for national policy loan cases that should be submitted to the board of directors for approval or reported to the chairman and vice chairman for handling after the secretariat of the Four-Bank Joint Office solicits the opinions of the Central Bank, the Four-Bank Joint Office will no longer directly handle business loan cases, and should be transferred to the Central Bank and professional banks and bureaus for consultation. Subsequently, the Four-Bank Joint Office passed the organizational regulations of the Central Bank's Rediscount Committee at the 362nd board of directors meeting on April 9, stipulating the committee's responsibilities. The National Bank's Rediscount Committee was officially established on April 27. Details have been reported in this publication several times before. It is now learned that the National Bank's Rediscount Committee's rediscount and re-mortgage business will begin on May 31. The interest rate will be publicly announced daily. The first day's rediscount rate has been set at 0.24, and the interbank lending rate is 0.18.
The organizational regulations of the Central Bank's Rediscount Committee were revised and approved by the 3256th meeting of the Standing Board of Directors. The regulations are recorded as follows: Article 1, This bank has established a Rediscount Committee to accept applications from banks and handle rediscount and re-mortgage matters, and its responsibilities are as follows: (1) Decision on rediscount policy, (2) Review of applications from banks for rediscount and re-mortgage, (3) Approval of rediscount and re-mortgage interest rates, (4) Other relevant rediscount matters. Article 2, The committee shall have 9 to 15 members, and the governor of this bank shall be a member ex officio, and the remaining members shall be appointed by the governor. Article 3, The governor shall be the chairman of the committee. Article 4, The committee shall hold a regular meeting once a week, and may convene temporary meetings when necessary. Article 5, The committee shall have an advisory committee for industry, mining, agriculture, and trade, which shall be organized by the governor appointing people from the financial and industrial sectors and experts, and assigning senior personnel from this bank, to be responsible for reviewing the submitted cases. Article 6, The committee may establish advisory committees in important locations in the country to review applications from local banks for rediscount and re-mortgage. Article 7, The standards for the committee to review rediscount cases shall be determined separately. Article 8, The committee shall have a chief secretary, one secretary, and several staff members, who shall be appointed by the governor. Article 9, These regulations shall be implemented after being approved by the board of directors of this bank, and the same shall apply when they are amended.
In order to achieve its goal of becoming a bank for banks, the Central Bank attaches the most importance to the use of interest rates and open market policies. Now that the National Bank's Rediscount Committee has started operations, how will it accomplish its great mission? Let us wait and see.

### Chemical Products We Can Now Manufacture Domestically; Decision to Restrict or Stop Imports

The National Economic Council submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, instructing relevant departments to comply.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 30th] The National Economic Council has decided that imports of chemical products that can now be manufactured domestically will be restricted or stopped from the seventh quarter. It is reported that the amendment to the list of chemical products in Appendix (2) of the Measures for Import and Export Trade has been approved by the Council and submitted to the Executive Yuan, instructing the Import and Export Control Commission and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to comply. The amendment stipulates:

(1)  Import of chemical products such as aspirin, hydrochloric acid, alcohol, ammonia solution, antimony trisulfide, calcium carbide, glycerin, oxygen, crystal alkali, concentrated crystal alkali, sodium silicate, sodium sulfate, carbon dioxide, acetone, monacetic acid, collodion acid, precipitated calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, and silver nitrate should be stopped because domestic manufacturers can produce enough to meet demand.

(2) Chemical products such as fuming sulfuric acid, alum, anhydrous ammonia, barium carbonate, copper sulfate, medicinal baking soda, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, and calcium acid are not in great demand, and they have been reclassified into Appendix 3A. Chemical products such as aluminum sulfate, barium sulfate, calcium chloride, nickel sulfate, and manganese dioxide will be temporarily reclassified into Appendix 3A before domestic products can fully supply them, and it is planned to delete them from the seventh quarter onwards. In addition, import of nitric acid with a concentration of 49 degrees or higher should be permitted, import of bleaching powder should be temporarily permitted as bleaching powder concentrate, and potassium phosphate green should be self-sufficient from the seventh quarter onwards. The remaining items in the original list will remain unchanged. Steel cylinders for holding chlorine gas and oxygen should be specially permitted for import.

(3) The remaining foreign exchange from each deleted chemical product item should, in principle, be evenly distributed to major chemical products such as caustic soda, phosphorus, potassium phosphate green, soda ash, and sulfur, as well as minor chemical products such as acetic acid, carbolic acid, hydrosulfite, borax, and sodium sulfide. As for the detailed method of even distribution, the Import and Export Control Commission, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Central Industrial Testing Institute, and the China Industrial Association are requested to consult with each other before reporting back to the Council.

(4) The quality standard of domestic chemical products shall be based on the standards set by the Central Standards Bureau, and shall be chemically tested by the Central Industrial Testing Institute, and shall assist various factories to strive to improve technology and meet the standards.

(5) In accordance with the principle of reviewing the Fifth and Sixth Quarter Import Quota List by this Council, it is proposed to change the original ratio of 32 to 68 between import merchants and industrial quotas proposed by the Import and Export Control Commission to 25 to 75.

(6) The prices of finished products manufactured using imported raw materials should be restricted. As for the restriction measures, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Import and Export Control Commission, the China Industrial Association, and the National Economic Council will consult and handle the matter.

(7) For various chemical products for which import is stopped and transferred to Appendix 3A, efforts should be made to increase production to achieve self-sufficiency in line with domestic needs. The Import and Export Control Commission, the Central Industrial Testing Institute, and the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will jointly formulate a plan.

(8) It is recommended that the Ministry of Economic Affairs encourage imitation and invention of chemical products that can replace imports.

(9) For factories with excellent products and new creations, the Import and Export Control Commission should give priority to allocating raw material quotas. As for the items for which import is planned to be stopped from the seventh quarter onwards, the Council has telegraphed the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to consult with the producing factories to formulate measures to increase production and ensure substantial increase in production. If the production volume cannot be reached at that time, import will still be allowed as before.

### More Bodies Found in the Train Fire Tragedy in Taiwan Province

[Our Taipei Dispatch of the 30th] In the train fire tragedy on the Xindian River Railway Bridge, 28 passengers have now registered with the Railway Bureau as missing. More deaths have been found, bringing the total to 65. According to the Railway Bureau, the regulations stipulate that it is not liable for compensation for public dangers caused by unforeseen events, so the aftermath of this tragedy may only be limited to relief funds. In addition, the District Prosecutor's Office came to the scene yesterday for inspection. The Railway Bureau disturbed the scene before reporting the inspection, making it difficult to verify the exact number of deaths, which was considered inappropriate.

### Two Drug Dens Cracked Down in Hankou

### Principal Culprit in Hankou Bribery Case Flees

[Our Hankou Dispatch of the 30th] Yin Qizhou, the principal culprit in the Hankou Wharf Workers' Union bribery case, was detained and questioned by the Garrison Command for four hours. Because Yin denied the crime, he was once released on bail. After Director Ren confirmed his crime, the Garrison Command issued an arrest warrant again, but the culprit had already fled. He is still being strictly pursued as of noon today. In addition, leaflets attacking Director Ren have been discovered from time to time in recent days, and public opinion here is speculating and commenting more and more.

### A Beacon in the Jin-Cha-Sui Border Region; The Miracle of Ying County

— Our Reporter Liu Yingyuan

[Our Gui Sui Air Mail Dispatch of the 25th] If Datong is an isolated island in the Yanbei Corridor, then Ying County is a beacon in the Jin-Cha-Sui Border Region. Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, the militia of Ying County has been shining brightly on the peaks of Heng Mountain, illuminating the hearts of the people in the Sanggan River Basin. When Datong was besieged the summer before last, it withstood the test of the storm. Not long after the Ping Sui Railway was cut off this summer, it was attacked by another wave of waves. Recently, good news has come from Ying County that this crumbling beacon has survived the night and persevered until dawn.

Qiao Richeng

Spiritual Inspiration

Ying County is located north of Yanmen Pass. Its transportation is not as good as Tianzhen and Yanggao, its terrain is not as dangerous as Guangling and Lingqiu, its agricultural products are not as good as Hunyuan and Shuoxian, and its mineral products are not as good as Zuoyun and Huairen. Why is Ying County the only one that can resist the two joint attacks of He Long and Nie Rongzhen? This is because Lower She Village in Ying County produced a Wang Fenggang of Yanbei—the late General Qiao Richeng. The two brilliant achievements of the Ying County Defense War are the victory of the people of Yanbei and the success of Qiao Richeng's leadership. Although Qiao Richeng died in the last Ying County Defense War, the miracle of this Ying County Defense War was still inspired by Qiao Richeng's spirit. Therefore, to report on the Ying County Defense War, we must first introduce General Qiao Richeng.

General Qiao Richeng attended the Seventh Provincial Middle School of Youyu and the Northern Military Academy, but because he was not an ordinary student, he was expelled from both schools. Before the War of Resistance, he was wanted by the Shanxi Provincial Government for standing up for injustice and offending the government. After the War of Resistance, when the Jin Sui Army retreated to the south of Yanmen Pass, he was the first to raise the anti-Japanese banner in Yanbei, contacting heroes from thirteen counties and establishing an army and government for people's self-defense and autonomy in his hometown of Lower She Village. The Japanese army in Datong launched dozens of sweeps, but none entered Lower She Village in Ying County. Qiao Richeng thus became the most agile guerrilla commander in the Second War Zone.

A Gun

Going to War Alone

From the winter of the 26th year to the spring of the 30th year, he expanded more than 8,000 self-defense forces with a pistol, and the anti-Japanese regime extended to Kouquan and Pingwang. It was not until the second year of the rebellion of the Shanxi New Army that, under the siege of the Japanese invaders and the Communist bandits, he ordered Regiment Commander Zhang Pu to hide his armed forces underground and left Yanbei alone, taking a pistol to Sui West.

In the later stages of the War of Resistance, Qiao Richeng traveled between Xi'an, Jixian, and Chongqing, running and appealing for the people of Yanbei. When Commander-in-Chief Fu sent him back to Yanbei in the spring of the 34th year, he had only a dozen broken guns and forty or fifty old and weak soldiers. The Twelfth War Zone Headquarters wanted to replenish his equipment, but he said that Chinese weapons were not as good as Japanese weapons, so he did not accept them. In March, he crossed the river from Tuoketuo and personally seized two Japanese-style light machine guns in Heicheng. Strong young men from Sui South joined him one after another. When his troops entered Yanbei from Shahu Pass, there were more than 500 officers and soldiers.

Surrounded

Fighting to the Death

When Japan surrendered, he was the first to take over Youyu, Zuoyu, Huairen, and initially arrived in Datong. Regiment Commander Zhang Pu also liberated Ying County and Hunyuan at the same time. Soon, the Communist bandits launched a full-scale rebellion, and he concentrated his forces to defend Ying County. Qiao Richeng's political style was to make the majority love him and the minority fear him. Over the years, the local ruffians and Communist bandit county-level cadres in Yanbei were almost all defeated by Qiao Richeng's subordinates, and the wealth of the counties in Yanbei became guns and cannons to defend Ying County. Until the first siege of Ying County the year before last, Qiao Richeng supervised the battle and died. The city was not breached by the bandits because the chief officer was killed. All parties then paid attention to this force and continuously supplied them with various kinds of assistance.

Defense War

Turning Danger into Safety

Commander Zhang Pu, who succeeded General Qiao Richeng, is still less than forty years old this year and was a cadre promoted from squad leader to regimental commander during the War of Resistance. He is good at training soldiers, so the militia of Ying County can engage in field battles.

This time, the Ying County Defense War not only suffered for Datong, but also attracted one brigade from Nie Rongzhen, eight regiments from He Long, and three regiments from Yao Zhe, totaling more than 30,000 people, which turned the situation in Chahar and Suiyuan from danger to safety. The miracle of Ying County is the glory of the people. To quell the bandit rebellion, we must develop more Qiao Richengs. We must cultivate more people's leaders like Zhang Pu and cultivate people's fortresses like Ying County. Recently, the Suiyuan Provincial Government appointed heroes like Li Sanmao Dan, Yang Santu, and Wu Sier as guerrilla commanders, allowing every city in Suiyuan to emit the dazzling light of Ying County.

### Rice Prices Continue to Fall in Suzhou and Wuxi; New Wheat from Bengbu Appears

[Our Suzhou Dispatch of the 30th] Rice prices in Suzhou continued to fall today. The market price for coarse japonica rice was 5.96 million yuan, superior white japonica rice was 6.68 million yuan, and retail white rice was 6.7 million yuan, a decrease of 150,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

[Our Wuxi Dispatch of the 30th] The money market in Wuxi is still tight, and prices continue to fall back. White japonica rice is 6,526,000 yuan, white yuan is 7,106,000 yuan, sheep indica rice is 6,476,000 yuan, port indica rice is 6,376,000 yuan, wheat is 5.3 million yuan, white wheat is 5.5 million yuan, flour is 1.97 million yuan, soybean oil is 23.5 million yuan, and cotton yarn is 204.8 million yuan.

[Our Bengbu Dispatch of the 30th] New wheat appeared on the market, opening at 7.55 million yuan. Red wheat and hua wheat both fell by 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, long rice rose slightly, cooking rice was weak, the bean market was dull, and white paper fell back by 7.6 million yuan.

[Our Quzhou Dispatch of the 30th] Grain prices have been soaring in recent days. Coarse white rice rose by another 500,000 to 600,000 yuan today, and superior white rice was 6.6 million yuan per stone.

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch of the 30th] Grain prices in Guangzhou have risen again in recent days due to continuous rain, rising water levels, and transportation difficulties, reaching more than 7.3 million yuan per 100 market catties. However, it is reported that the provincial authorities have been transporting surplus grain from the province, and have accumulated about 250,000 dan of rice to date. The reserves are sufficient, so a sharp increase is not expected in the short term.
