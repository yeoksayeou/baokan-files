### Currency Reform Only Allows Success: The President's Earnest Explanation of Essential Points, Instructing Mutual Trust and Cooperation Between the Government and the People

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] The President, considering the great impact of the promulgated Emergency Measures for Finance and Economy on the lives of the nation and its people, and to ensure its smooth implementation and the complete achievement of its intended goals, held a tea party at the Lizi Society in the capital at 4:30 PM on the 20th. He invited figures from the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors of Beijing and Shanghai, earnestly explaining the importance of these measures and his hopes for these individuals. The President began by stating: "The reform of the currency system was something we discussed at the beginning of our victory and recovery. However, it was not implemented due to certain issues. Now, with the determination and thorough preparations of Premier Weng and Finance Minister Wang, it is being officially announced and implemented today. This measure has a great impact on the lives of the people. Once implemented, it must succeed and cannot fail. The most important thing is that the government and the people can trust and cooperate with each other. We also hope that the financial sector can lead and assist, so that the government's policies can be assisted and the task completed." The President also stated: "The maximum amount of the new currency to be issued is 2 billion, equivalent to 500 million US dollars. The reserves are 40% in gold, silver, and foreign currency, totaling over 300 million, and 60% in goods, totaling 300 million. The subsidiary currency can be backed by the copper from Japanese reparations, which is also worth 100 million US dollars. Therefore, the guarantee is undoubtedly sufficient. We hope that the industrial and commercial sectors can lead and cooperate." After the President's speech, Xu Jiyu, Qin Hanqing, and Pan Gongzhan each delivered speeches. Xu and Qin expressed their determination to support the government's policies and work together to achieve success. Finally, Pan Gongzhan, as a representative of public opinion, delivered a speech offering suggestions, emphasizing the establishment of a psychological foundation. There must be mutual trust between the government and the people, working as one, which will surely lead to success. Secondly, there should be a cyclical system for prices, wages, and interest rates. To stabilize prices and wages simultaneously, it is essential to suppress interest rates. Pan also stated: "The implementation of this measure is the key to the survival of the people and the government. We hope that the government will especially trust legitimate industry and commerce, especially trade associations, so that the promotion of the new currency system will be successfully achieved." Pan also emphasized that the responsibilities of the Currency Reform and Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee must be taken seriously. Its decisions should be respected, and its inspection and supervision should be carried out with a detached and independent attitude, ensuring openness and impartiality. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM.

### Premier Weng Convenes a Discussion Meeting, Encouraging All Sectors to Jointly Promote Major Decisions

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] Premier of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao, invited responsible persons from national agencies and bureaus, as well as figures from the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors of Beijing and Shanghai, and representatives of public opinion, to discussion meetings on the 20th, both in the morning and afternoon. He explained the key points of the implementation of the measures and what he hoped from these individuals. The discussion meeting with figures from the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors of Beijing and Shanghai was held at 3 PM on the 20th. Weng, along with Finance Minister Wang Yunwu and Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian, attended. Weng delivered a speech first, followed by reports from Ministers Wang and Chen. All were promoting the decision-making of the emergency measures for finance and economy, hoping that everyone could unite and assist in promoting this major government decision, believing that it would surely succeed. Subsequently, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, spoke, raising concerns about the issues of prices and wages after the currency reform, and hoping that the government would have a thorough plan to assist in successfully achieving the mission. The meeting adjourned around 4 PM. It is learned that the participants in the meeting included Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Jiang Jingguo, Lin Chongyong, Xu Jiyu, Qin Runqing, Dai Mingli, and over thirty others. The key figures from Shanghai all rushed to Beijing on the 20th after receiving a telegram from Weng and returned to Shanghai that evening.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] Premier Weng delivered a speech at the discussion meeting with figures from the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors, first explaining the important significance of the various measures in the emergency measures for finance and economy. He stated that since our victory and recovery, we have been listed as one of the five great powers, and the people should be able to share in peace and happiness. However, due to the disturbances caused by the Communist Party, industry and commerce have been hindered, leading to rising prices and making it difficult to control national treasury expenditures. This situation has shaken monetary credibility. Therefore, the Executive Yuan has formulated the emergency measures for finance and economy with the greatest determination, focusing on currency reform, aiming to strictly control the budget, balance national treasury revenue and expenditure, strengthen economic controls, stabilize market prices, and achieve the goal of stabilizing the economy and the people's livelihood. Secondly, Weng explained that the method of currency reform prioritizes restoring people's confidence in the currency. At the same time, a Currency Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee will be established to conduct monthly inspections and announcements to the whole country. Weng then emphasized the strict control of the national treasury budget, hoping that the people of the whole country would make joint efforts, firstly by strictly streamlining personnel and saving expenses in state-owned enterprises, and secondly by recognizing the current financial difficulties and actively paying taxes, assisting the government in eliminating concealment and leakage, ensuring that every penny goes to the public treasury. Finally, Weng reiterated that this emergency measure is a major reform for the government, which must be thoroughly implemented with all efforts. He hoped that everyone could work together with one heart and one mind to implement it, which is what he deeply hopes for.

### Responsible Persons of National Agencies and Bureaus Discuss Technical Issues of Currency Reform

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] Premier Weng invited senior responsible persons from various national banks to a discussion meeting at the Executive Yuan at 9 AM on the 20th. Those present included Song Hanzhang, Xi Demao, Cheng Yuanfan, Shou Miancheng, Li Shuming, Zhao Dihua, and over ten others. Wang Yunwu and Xu Baiyuan also participated. Weng first reported on the progress of the currency reform, hoping that the responsible persons of the various national banks would jointly support and fully cooperate, so that the currency reform could be completely successful. Subsequently, the responsible persons of the various national agencies and bureaus exchanged views, expressing their support for the government's currency reform measures and raising some technical issues in implementation. They exchanged views on the methods of remittance rates, interest rates, loans, and the distribution of gold yuan certificates among the banks. No conclusions were reached at the adjournment, and it was decided that the Central Bank would reconvene a meeting with the various national agencies and bureaus on the 21st to discuss and decide. Xi Demao, Li Fusun, Zhao Dihua, Song Hanzhang, Cheng Yuanfan, Li Shuming, Shou Miancheng, Xu Baiyuan, and others all went to Shanghai on the 20th.

### Specific Implementation Measures for Controlling the Economy and Prices

Being Drafted by the Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce are actively drafting some specific implementation and supplementary measures for the implementation of the measures for organizing finance and strengthening economic control. The Ministry of Finance has resumed a full-day office system starting on the 20th. In the morning, Wang Yunwu convened a meeting of the heads of relevant units to report on the key points of the currency reform and explain that some supplementary measures should be drafted quickly to strengthen implementation. Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian also convened a meeting on the morning of the 20th with Vice Ministers Tong Jiling and Zhang Zizhu, as well as Director of the Control Department Fei Jianyang and Director of the Commerce Department Deng Hanliang, to discuss the issue of formulating specific implementation measures based on the emergency measures for finance and economy. In addition to reporting on the content of the currency reform plan, Chen also instructed the relevant departments to quickly formulate the specific implementation measures related to the plan within one or two days, and made the following instructions: (1) The emergency decree stipulates that prices are frozen at the gold yuan equivalent of the prices on August 19th. The specific implementation measures for price investigation and price limits/negotiations should be drafted by the Control Department. (2) Measures for prohibiting the sale of imported goods. (3) Measures for cracking down on hoarding and speculation. In the past, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had drafted measures and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review and approval. The Control Department should revise and strengthen them. As for the temporary suspension of business of the Tianjin and Shanghai Stock Exchanges, the measures for future resumption of business, and how to convert the registered capital of companies, the Commerce Department should jointly draft with the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance.

### National Bank Capital: Maximum of One Million Gold Certificates

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] According to Article 30 of the measures for organizing finance and strengthening economic control in the emergency measures for finance and economy, the minimum capital amount of banks in various regions of the country should be drafted by the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance. It is learned that the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance has completed this measure and will submit it to Minister Wang for forwarding to the Executive Yuan for review and approval. This measure had been drafted earlier, but because the currency system has now been reformed, it is being drafted separately. It is reported that according to the conversion of gold yuan certificates, the maximum capital amount of banks is 1 million gold yuan certificates (before the war, it was 500,000 yuan, with 2 gold yuan certificates only equivalent to 1 yuan of legal currency before the war). Banks in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, which belong to the first tier, must make up this amount of capital before they can continue to operate. The lowest area also requires 100,000 gold yuan.

### Foreign Minister Wang's Talk

Strict Implementation of Reform Measures Can Make US Aid Plan Effective

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued a written statement on the 20th, saying: "The government announced a self-help plan a few months ago. The new decree is the main part of implementing this self-help plan. After my representative signed the bilateral economic aid agreement with the United States on July 3, I stated that I would do my best to make the Chinese government implement its responsibilities with the greatest sincerity. The reforms promulgated by the President's order on August 19th should be more successful during the implementation of this US aid plan, because the imbalance of international payments is one of the major difficulties of our country's currency reform. The implementation of the US aid plan can guarantee the supply of some important imported materials, so this major difficulty has been largely resolved at present. On the other hand, the adoption and strict implementation of this new reform measure should make the US aid plan more effective."

### Wang Yunwu Talks About the Gold Yuan Certificate Fund, Mainly Relying on Self-Reliance, Adjustment of Prices of State-Owned Enterprises is to Avoid Inflation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] Finance Minister Wang Yunwu hosted Chinese and foreign reporters at 6 PM on the 20th, first announcing that before this currency reform, he had telegraphed the Executive Committee of the International Monetary Fund meeting, explaining that China had decided to reform the currency system and the brief key points of the reform. He has now received a reply, expressing admiration for our country's currency reform and believing that the measures are very appropriate, and wishing the reform success. Wang then answered questions from reporters. The main points are as follows: (1) State-owned enterprises are still allowed to adjust ticket prices according to pre-war standards in order to avoid inflation of the new currency. At the same time, no more subsidies will be given to state-owned enterprises, which is also a resolution of the Legislative Yuan. After the currency reform, although the people's income is not as good as before the war, or even half less than before the war, the price increase of state-owned enterprises is only based on the pre-war standard, not completely according to the pre-war standard. (2) Increasing tax revenue is also not according to the pre-war standard, which will be slightly lower than the pre-war standard, but the luxury tax should be increased more. (3) The treatment of civil servants is not up to the pre-war standard because of the current financial difficulties, so a discount is given, but it will be improved when the national finances improve. After this reform, it is actually higher than the past legal currency era. There is absolutely no restriction on the circulation of subsidiary currency. A foreign reporter asked whether the government was going to borrow money from the United States after the currency reform. Wang laughed and said: "This is our hope. In the beginning, we certainly hope to rely on self-reliance, but when necessary, we also hope for the assistance of friendly countries." Wang also said in a firm tone: "This currency reform must be implemented to the end. Anyone who destroys this plan will be severely punished."

### The Gold Yuan Certificate Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee: Nine Members Have Been Appointed, Organization Regulations Formulated and Promulgated by the Executive Yuan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] In order to consolidate the credit of the gold yuan certificate, the Executive Yuan has formulated and promulgated the organization regulations of the Gold Yuan Certificate Issuance Supervisory Committee.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] The Gold Yuan Certificate Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee is about to be established. A total of nine members have been appointed, including four government representatives: Vice Minister of Finance Li Tang, Deputy Director-General of the Directorate-General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics Pang Songzhou, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank Liu Gongyun, and Vice Minister of the Audit Department Cai Pingfan. The five representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors and various industries are Xu Jiyu, Wang Xiaolai, Li Ming, Qin Runqing, and Xi Yushu.

### Economic Control Committee Established Within the Executive Yuan, Sending Senior Officials to be Permanently Stationed in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] In order to strengthen price control, crack down on speculation and hoarding, regulate the supply of materials, and save consumption, so as to effectively implement the emergency measures for finance and economy, the Executive Yuan has established an Economic Control Committee within the Executive Yuan, responsible for planning and supervising matters related to stabilizing the economy, and has appointed senior economic control supervisors to be permanently stationed in the three regions of Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou to supervise and guide, in order to implement and achieve results.

### Prices Under the New Currency System Will Definitely Be Stable, Balancing the Budget is Guaranteed, Only Hope That the Whole Country Will Abide by the Regulations

President Yu's Reception of Reporters

[Our Dispatch] After President Yu Hongjun of the Central Bank returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning, he hosted reporters at the Central Bank at 11 o'clock, emphasizing that currency reform is a necessary measure to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure. The full text of his report is as follows:

"We all know that rising prices and the inability to balance the budget are mutually cause and effect; if we want to wait until the budget is balanced before reforming the currency system, we will inevitably be affected by this cycle and not know when to delay it. All financial and economic measures depend on the stability of the currency value, so the government resolutely made the greatest determination to reform the currency system, using the stability of prices under the new currency system to help balance the budget. Approaching budget balance can achieve long-term stability, so this emergency decree takes currency reform and financial reorganization as the central measures, supplemented by a plan to stabilize prices by controlling the economy. The handling of gold, silver, and foreign currency, and the registration and management of foreign exchange assets can eliminate an important factor disrupting domestic finance and prices on the one hand, and can also fully utilize these assets to help domestic production and construction. The difference between this emergency decree and previous reform plans is that it starts from the most basic aspects, which shows that the government has made the greatest determination and is determined to succeed. From Minister Wang's talk, we can see that the government not only has the determination to balance the budget, but also has a way to balance the budget. After the currency reform, the national finances can definitely be greatly improved, but the measures in each clause are interconnected and fully coordinated. Many aspects require the cooperation of people from all walks of life and the industrial and financial sectors. It is hoped that the whole country will abide by the various regulations to achieve the goals of stabilizing the economy, increasing production, and developing trade."

New Currency to Be Generally Issued Nationwide Starting Monday

Yu then answered reporters' questions, saying: "The gold yuan certificate will be officially issued starting today, but because the silver and money industry will be temporarily closed on the 20th and 21st, and the 22nd is Sunday, the new currency will actually begin to circulate on Monday (the 23rd). Starting from the 15th of this month, the National Bank has secretly transported various gold yuan certificates to branches all over the country." Yu also showed samples of various gold yuan certificates, including five denominations of one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, and one hundred yuan, all of which were printed by the American Bank Note Company in 1945 (34th year of the Republic). The certificates of yuan and below, such as jiao and fen, were printed by the De La Rue Printing Company in 1946 (35th year of the Republic). The printing year of the new currency shows that the government had already started currency reform work after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. (Copperplate illustration of gold yuan certificate published on page six)

Regarding how to thoroughly implement the various measures in the emergency measures for finance and economy, Yu revealed that Jiang Jingguo had visited him in the morning of the 20th to discuss this matter. He has decided to convene a meeting on the 21st with Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, Speaker Pan, Chairman Fang, Deputy Speaker Xu, and Director Lin Chongyong to conduct specific research on this.

Hoping that Bank Interest Rates Will Return to Pre-War Standards

Yu also answered the following questions: (1) The gold yuan certificate is a type of managed gold standard. (2) There are clear regulations for the sale of gold ornaments in silver shops, but gold blocks must not be melted into ornaments. (3) The government should gradually reduce bank interest rates, hoping to return to pre-war standards. (4) The exchange rate will never change after the issuance of the new currency. (5) The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee will be abolished, but the Gold Management Bureau and the Export Management Committee still need to exist.

Sending Personnel to Various Places to Instruct on Issuance Techniques

[Another Report] President Yu convened a meeting of responsible persons from various bureaus and departments of the bank at 12 noon on the 20th to discuss various technical issues related to the implementation of currency reform. Yu gave detailed instructions and listened to reports. For example, how to transfer accounts and estimate the needs of the market were decided on the spot. In addition, in order to clarify the implementation techniques for the important branches in other locations, it was decided to send Ji Chaoding (Xi'an), Gao Fang (Tianjin), Wang Chui (Northeast), Lin Weiying (Guangzhou), and Fang Shangui (Hankou) to the branches immediately to provide guidance. It is also learned that Yang Xiaobo, manager of the Chongqing branch, and Wu Benjing, manager of the Xiamen branch, who are staying in Shanghai on official business, will also depart on the same day. The meeting did not end until 2 PM.

### Minting of Subsidiary Currency: Shanghai Mint to Be Restored

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] For the minting of subsidiary currency, the Ministry of Finance will restore the Shanghai Mint to take charge. It will be divided into three types: (1) Silver coins, divided into one yuan and five jiao; (2) Nickel coins, divided into two jiao, one jiao, and five fen; (3) Copper coins, only one fen. Most of the above three types of subsidiary currency, silver coins and nickel coins, were originally stored in Chongqing, Guiyang, and Chengdu and have been transported to Beijing and Shanghai. Copper coins must be newly minted.

### Lou Tongsun Talks About Currency Reform: Deficits Should Be Publicly Disclosed in the Future, Hoping that Citizens Will Exchange Gold Notes on Schedule

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] Economist Lou Tongsun said: The measures adopted in this currency reform prove that the authorities have the courage to face reality and seek to clarify the current chaotic currency situation. The ratio of the gold yuan certificate to legal currency, gold, silver, and US dollars specified in the plan adopts a ratio close to the facts, and this ratio is quite close to the ratio when the legal currency was implemented before the war. Such reforms will minimize the market changes that may occur domestically and abroad due to currency reform. In particular, the public issuance, the establishment of a supervisory agency, and the stipulation of the maximum amount of issuance are a major progress and what I have advocated for many years. I am deeply gratified that this can be implemented, but there are also some regrets. The spirit of currency reform adopted by Romania in August last year and the Soviet Union in December last year was not used when legal currency, gold, silver, and foreign currency were exchanged for gold yuan certificates, with the good intention of adjusting the purchasing power of various levels during currency reform. As for the balance of the national budget mentioned in this measure, according to the precedents of advanced countries, to seek the true balance of the national budget, the statutory relationship between the national treasury and the issuing agency should be determined, and deficits should be fully disclosed in the future, which can both supervise the issuance and arouse the nation's attention to national finances. Regarding the gold, silver, and foreign currency stored by the people, Lou hopes that citizens will demonstrate a high degree of patriotism, abide by the measures promulgated by the government, and exchange them on schedule. Lou also hopes that the government will study stronger measures for the management of the silver industry. Regarding the declaration and registration of assets of Chinese citizens abroad, Lou also hopes that it can be earnestly implemented. Finally, Lou also believes that strengthening the control of financial institutions in the plan is particularly important, expresses special support, and advocates that the government should have greater determination and gradually implement it.

### Prices Converted to Gold Yuan Certificates: All Based on August 19th, Severe Punishment for Dishonest Merchants Who Raise Prices Privately

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] The government regards this emergency measure for finance and economy as the key to stabilizing the national economy and implementing the suppression of the rebellion, 當此實旋伊始, it is difficult to guarantee that a few people do not understand the meaning and effect of currency reform, or that there are dishonest merchants who disregard the overall situation and raise prices privately, disrupting the market. After the Executive Yuan approved the cases at the cabinet meeting last night and submitted them to the President for promulgation, it immediately issued a notice to the provincial and municipal governments across the country, stating that according to the provisions of the measures for strengthening economic control, the gold yuan certificate prices of local goods and services should all be based on the local prices on August 19th of this year as the highest conversion standard, and no further increases are allowed. Thereafter, prices should be handled in accordance with the regulations on cracking down on violations of price limits and negotiated prices, and violators will be severely punished according to law.

### Zhang Qun Flies to Tokyo Today, Stays for Two Weeks Before Going to South Korea, MacArthur Hosts a Reception for Zhang Tomorrow Afternoon

### The Plan is Generally Satisfactory, But There Are Still Some Regrets

Jian Guansan Answers Reporters' Questions

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 20th] A reporter consulted Legislative Yuan member Jian Guansan on the currency reform and received the following answer: "The major purpose of currency reform and economic measures is to combat the inflation and exploitation of a small number of people and to maintain the stable living of the majority of people. The plan announced this time is generally satisfactory, but there are also some regrets. Briefly speaking, they can be summarized as the following points: (1) The difference in the exchange rate between the new and old currencies was not stipulated according to the huge economic differences between ordinary people and wealthy households; (2) A large amount of floating capital was not frozen, but unlimited exchange of old currency for new currency was allowed; (3) The ratio of gold to US dollars is significantly higher, while the ratio of silver dollars is stipulated to be slightly lower; (4) The foreign exchange assets of the wealthy abroad were not frozen; (5) The base for the salaries of soldiers and public school staff is stipulated too low. It is hoped that the authorities can remedy the above items to comfort public opinion. As for the nationalization of gold, which has been my advocacy for many years, I am quite gratified that it has now been realized."

### Chen Lifu Goes to Washington, Will Meet with the US Secretary of the Treasury

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th] Chen Lifu, Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, is scheduled to leave here tonight for Washington, where he will meet with the US Secretary of the Treasury tomorrow afternoon, and then go to the Moral Re-Armament Conference in Truto to deliver a speech.

### Wang Lingji Summoned by the President, Will Fly to the Capital for Duty in the Coming Days

[Our Chengdu Dispatch on the 20th] Wang Lingji was summoned by President Chiang Kai-shek on the 20th and will fly to Beijing in the coming days for duty. He will also consult with the Central District on issues such as Sichuan defense, construction, and conscription, and will discuss and decide on the annual Sichuan requisition and allocation quota, which is currently in dispute between the Sichuan Provincial Assembly and the Ministry of Food.

### Saving Changchun, Preparing a Plan

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 20th] The specific plan for saving Changchun has been formulated by the local authorities and transferred to the central government for adoption. It is learned that the central government's position on Changchun is extremely firm, and it is extremely concerned about the food of hundreds of thousands of people.

### My Currency Stabilization Measures Welcomed by Wall Street; International Monetary Fund Has Been Notified by Us

[Central News Agency, New York, 19th] The Chinese government's issuance of new currency has greatly surprised the Wall Street banking and trade circles here, which are usually extremely well-informed. They are taking a very cautious attitude toward this. Many people interviewed by reporters said that any measures taken by the Chinese government to stabilize the currency would be welcome. However, they raised many questions about the currency reform and pointed out that they could not comment on it until they had read the full text of the currency reform plan. Trade circles believe that a Chinese new currency with a stable value will help Sino-US trade, but they have not learned whether the Chinese government will remove trade restrictions in addition to currency reform to make Sino-US trade smoother. When reporters asked Wall Street figures whether China's exchange rate of four gold yuan to one US dollar needed to be approved by the International Monetary Fund, a banker replied that China is not currently a designated member of the Fund, so it is free to set the exchange rate between the new currency and the US dollar. However, once China becomes a designated member, it must obtain the Fund's permission before it can easily devalue or revalue its currency. The news of China's currency reform reached here this morning and immediately became the topic of conversation among people concerned about China. American banks with large deposits from Chinese people are eager to learn whether the Chinese government's regulations on redeeming US dollars held by the people also apply to the deposits of Chinese people here. If so, how will it be implemented? The general impression here is that the situation regarding China's issuance of new currency will not be clear until at least a week later.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] A Central News Agency reporter learned today that the International Monetary Fund has received formal notification from the Chinese government informing it of China's currency reform and the establishment of the Chinese "gold yuan." It is heard that the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund met this afternoon to discuss the report on China's currency reform. The Fund has no issue of recognizing or taking any action on China's new currency system. Therefore, no formal statement was issued after the meeting to explain the Fund's position. An official of the Fund emphasized that China's actions do not need to be approved or rejected by the International Monetary Fund. Although China was not required to notify the Fund in advance of the steps it intends to take, this expression now is sufficient to prove the close cooperation between China and the International Monetary Fund.

Editorial

### Eliminating the Source of Chaos Should Be the Priority for Stabilizing Order

Recently, labor unrest and student unrest have occurred one after another, with a great momentum of "one wave not yet subsided, another wave rises again," causing social order to be chaotic and people's minds to be turbulent and uneasy. For the people, there is no possibility of "living and working in peace and contentment." Everyone is longing for the country to turn chaos into stability. For the country, whether social order is stable or not is a symbol of the country's governance, and it must not be allowed to evolve naturally.

However, according to reports from various sources, the communist bandits are increasingly intensifying their disturbances, disregarding the lives and deaths of the people, and secretly planting spies in various places in our rear areas to engage in "underground work" in an attempt to open up their so-called "second front" to echo the bandit troops on the front lines. The means they have adopted, in addition to instigating labor unrest and other behaviors that are sufficient to hinder production, also use vocational students in various schools to promote bandit propaganda verbally and in writing, spread rumors, shake people's hearts, and prepare for large-scale movements such as strikes, marches, and petitions in the future. Currently, although the schools are still in summer vacation, they are still occupied by vocational students, who regard the schools as "concessions" and openly engage in various anti-government activities. All those who are familiar with the inside information of the education circles believe that once the autumn semester begins, a large-scale student unrest will break out, which will inevitably have a serious impact on social order. This prediction is by no means an alarmist statement, but has a reliable basis. For the sake of preventing problems before they occur, the government authorities have issued a general order from the Executive Yuan to the local administrative and security agencies to make proper preparations and promulgated four major matters that should be paid attention to in the rear areas during the period of suppressing the rebellion. Whether it is for the sake of stabilizing people's livelihood and social order, or for the sake of safeguarding the lifeline of the country, the Executive Yuan's adoption of this measure is worthy of unanimous support from the people of the whole country.

The current situation in our country is that, on the one hand, the communist bandits are launching a rebellion and attempting to seize power by force; while on the other hand, the government has long mobilized to suppress the rebellion, hoping to quell the bandits in the shortest possible time. The war on the front lines is raging fiercely on both sides. How can the government allow the communist spies to engage in "underground work" in the rear areas? However, if the government wants to eliminate bandit spies and stabilize the order in the rear areas, it will inevitably have to take measures that harm the basic rights of the people, which does not seem to be what a constitutional government should do. Therefore, although suppressing the rebellion and building the country has already been the current national policy, the government cannot avoid having the concern of "throwing a stone at the rat for fear of breaking the vase," and is unwilling to let go and do it, resulting in tolerating evil and creating the current situation where bandit spies run rampant in the rear areas. Some people in society are full of the idea that constitutionalism and suppressing the rebellion cannot coexist without contradicting each other. In the past, the government authorities also committed this kind of mistaken view and never had the spirit of "a brave man cutting off his wrist." However, as of today, communist spies have become even more rampant and unscrupulous under the cover of constitutional government. The government is indeed in a predicament, and has only taken emergency measures to eliminate bandit spies in the rear areas. All kind and patriotic people will certainly be able to endure the pain for a while.

The democratization of politics is the only way out for the Republic of China. Only by implementing the Three Principles of the People and implementing constitutional democracy can China become a strong, unified, peaceful, and democratic new China. Therefore, we have sincerely expressed our support for the political consultation conference after the victory to strive for political democratization and the nationalization of the army, as well as the later government's convening of the National Assembly to formulate a democratic constitution, and then to organize a democratic new government in accordance with the provisions of the constitution. However, looking back at the Communist Party, it is launching a rebellion, disregarding the lifeline of the country and the nation, and disregarding the lives and deaths of the people. In order to seize power, it will stop at nothing. In order to achieve its goals, even if it means the destruction of the country and the extermination of the race, it will not hesitate at all. Except for the insane who are willing to be communist spies, most kind ordinary people regard the communist bandits as the public enemy of the people. In particular, students who have clear minds and correct thoughts deeply know that if the bandit rebellion is not quelled for a day, the people's lives cannot be stable for a day. Recalling the people's lives since the victory, it is like "the water is getting deeper and the fire is getting hotter." If the people do not want to pay a heavy price and temporarily sacrifice their basic personal rights, then they cannot escape the water and fire and ascend to a comfortable seat. The government's measures, on the surface, seem to harm the people's rights, but in reality, the government's measures are to stabilize social order so that the people in the rear areas can live and work in peace and contentment, just like a doctor performing surgery on a patient. Enduring the pain for a while can turn danger into safety.

However, we also want to say a few words to the government. In recent years, the frequent occurrence of student unrest and labor unrest in various places, in addition to the manipulation and instigation of bandit spies, also has other objective factors, which is by no means accidental. The so-called "things must rot before worms are born." If there is absolutely no problem in the society itself, even if bandit spies have superior methods, they cannot create waves out of nothing, let alone add fuel to the fire. Therefore, we hope that the administrative and security agencies in various places, in addition to earnestly implementing the measures promulgated by the Executive Yuan, should also address the root causes, prevent all sources of chaos, and ensure that bandit spies have no opportunity to take advantage of.

### People Place Eager Hopes on the New Currency System; Positive Responses Nationwide; Price Fluctuations Are Only Temporary Phenomena

Capital

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The government's swift and decisive measures to reform the currency system have been valued by the citizens. The sales of newspapers have increased sharply. The two batches of newspapers flown and transported by train to Nanjing were quickly snapped up. Currency reform has become a topic of conversation, and can be heard everywhere, but people's hearts are calm and there is no fear. Salaried people calculate the amount of their income based on the exchange rate. Low-level civil servants are quite satisfied. Employees of state-owned enterprises are slightly uneasy. Those who rely on wages for a living are taking a wait-and-see attitude, hoping that the government and employers can formulate reasonable measures. On the 20th, the Nanjing market was calm and tranquil all day long. Transactions were light. The prices of various goods mostly remained unchanged, and no one changed to using the new currency for pricing. Silver shops continued to operate as usual. Except for bar silver, which was unavailable, decorated gold was still sold for 595 million and bought for 545 million per tael. There were a large number of customers asking for prices. The silver dollar market was desolate. Since early morning, silver dollar dealers have been making their final struggles, initially shouting out 65,000, then buying in at 64,000, but only offering, not buying. Later, it fell to 56,000 for selling and 54,000 for buying, only selling, not buying. By the evening, it went up again, but very few transactions were made. Silver dollar dealers reversed their usual momentum and were all dejected. The source of rice was smooth and abundant. The Wuyang Market was noisy, but most were spectators. The market price did not fluctuate. All banks and credit cooperatives in the city have been ordered to close. Some agency employees who were originally scheduled to receive their salaries on the 20th were greatly disappointed. The value of the legal tender is expected to increase. Shops are eager to sell goods, and the prices of all things have a downward trend.

Hankou

[Our newspaper, Hankou, 20th] When the news of the currency reform came, the people here were very excited. Today, hard currency fell back, and cotton yarn and rice remained stable. Public and educational personnel especially congratulated each other.

Here, silver dollars were only worth 4.8 million legal tender on the 19th. Because the regulations on the issuance of gold yuan notes stipulated that each silver dollar was equivalent to 2 yuan in gold notes, the value of silver dollars was 6 million legal tender. Therefore, the value of silver dollars rose sharply. Price fluctuations in Hunan depended on the rise and fall of silver dollars. As a result, the prices of various goods rose by more than one-third, and the situation was very chaotic. Until noon, all shops refused to sell goods, and the market was virtually at a standstill.

General opinion placed good hopes on the currency reform, but generally thought that the ratio of the new currency to the US dollar was too high in southern China.

### Fu Sinian on the Overall Situation at Home and Abroad: The Time for a US-Soviet War Is Not Yet Ripe

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 20th] The well-known political commentator Fu Mengzhen (Sinian) arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 20th. When reporters visited him, Mr. Fu, looking tired from his journey, briefly discussed the ever-changing domestic and international situation of the past year, but rarely expressed his opinions. Because Mr. Fu was in the United States for medical treatment and did not see Chinese newspapers, he was aware of but not familiar with the domestic situation. He avoided commenting on matters such as the election of the president and vice president, and the Legislative Yuan's enthusiastic desire to elect Mr. Fu as the vice president. When reporters asked him whether he would meet the president or whether he would be willing to take any position in the Legislative Yuan, he answered "no" to all, and said that due to his health, he needed to rest for half a day every day, so he could not take on heavy responsibilities. He also specifically stated that he had never made such preparations. The reporter then asked for his views on the inevitable war between the United States and the Soviet Union. Mr. Fu said that under this contradictory and delicate relationship, a war would inevitably occur in the future, but certain issues, such as the US's inability to deploy 200,000 troops abroad for combat, and the Soviet Union's navy, would not allow the war to break out before the end of this year or within the next year. Mr. Fu also said that the Chinese Communist Party, relying on the Soviet Union, wanted to seize the opportunity to fish in troubled waters, which was like a grandfather waiting for the birth of his grandson, quite difficult. When the reporter asked about the American attitude towards Feng Yuxiang, Mr. Fu said that the Americans would politely ask him to leave because he was involved with the Communist Party, which was unacceptable to the United States. Finally, when the reporter asked for his opinions on student activists and currency reform, Mr. Fu did not comment.

### Disaster in Various Embankments Around Xiangbin Lake, Accounting for Half of All Lake Fields; Relief Funds Have Not Yet Reached the Hands of the Disaster Victims

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 20th] According to reports received by the provincial government from various counties regarding the disaster situation around Xiangbin Lake, out of a total of 661 embankments, 306 embankments collapsed, accounting for nearly half of all lake fields. Among them, Feng County suffered the most embankment collapses, with only one embankment remaining out of the county's 63 embankments, and even that was flooded, resulting in a 100% disaster rate. In other counties such as Nan County, Yuanjiang, and Anxiang, many embankments also collapsed, and all the uncollapsed embankments were also flooded, also resulting in a 100% disaster rate. In Hanshou, Huarong, Changde, Yueyang, Linxiang, Xiangyin, and Yiyang, some reclaimed land was not affected by the floods, so the disaster rate was only considered 90%. Farmers in the disaster area are gathered together, making a living by selling their family property. As a result, the prices of pork, chicken, and beef are particularly cheap. Currently, pork is selling for 480,000 per catty, which is three-quarters cheaper than the price in Changsha. Those who cannot make a living are leading the old and carrying the young to beg for food in other places. The central government's 40 billion emergency relief fund, after distribution, amounted to a maximum of 600,000 for a large family and 300,000 for a small family. The disaster victims in Yuanjiang only received 150,000, which is not enough to buy half a liter of rice. Moreover, even this small amount has not yet reached the hands of the disaster victims after passing through the province, county, and township levels.

The three ambassadors held a meeting for half an hour, after which Smith and Roberts returned to the US Embassy for another meeting. The reason for the postponement of the meeting between the ambassadors of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom with Molotov may be due to the difficulty in obtaining replies from the governments of the three countries. Reliable sources believe that the content of this meeting may be announced, unless the three envoys believe that further meetings are necessary.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 19th] An American spokesperson here stated today with reserved confidence that at the next meeting of Western envoys with Molotov, an east-west agreement on Germany is expected to be established. The spokesperson said, "I am optimistic. However, we have now discussed it to its core, so it is difficult to say for sure until the last minute."

[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] The Times of London's Berlin correspondent wrote in the newspaper, citing Soviet sources, that Marshal Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces in Germany, has returned to Berlin, carrying the Soviet government's correct instructions regarding the exclusion of Western powers from the German capital. The correspondent continued, "If the Moscow consultations cannot reach a final agreement, it is expected that the Soviet Union will gradually use pressure to make the Berlin blockade 100% effective, and this is already showing signs. The correspondent concluded that, judging from the Moscow talks and everything that has happened in Berlin, it shows that the Soviet Union is trying to gain complete control of Berlin whenever possible. In fact, within a week, the Soviet Union has tried twice to cross the border of its Berlin zone to control the police power in the Western zone. Regardless of the true intention of their pursuit of black market merchants, this matter has hinted that the Soviet Union's policy of seizing the rights of Western powers is increasing day by day.

### Incidents in Berlin Continue to Emerge; Soviet Troops Cross Border to Search for Black Market Merchants; Four German Police Officers from the US Zone Kidnapped

[Associated Press, Berlin, 20th] US and British occupation authorities stated on the 10th that they do not intend to protest to the Soviet authorities regarding the shooting of black market merchants by German police in the Soviet zone on Potsdam Street on the evening of the 19th.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 20th] Officials from the US Public Safety Bureau stated that at least five German police officers from the US zone of Berlin were kidnapped by Soviet troops at the border between the US and Soviet western zones, including the chief of the police station in the area, Hoppe. Three of the five have escaped and returned to the US zone. They were captured by Soviet troops in the Kreuzberg district on the morning of the 20th when German police in the Soviet zone shot at black market traders. However, according to later reports from the German police station, a total of six police personnel were missing, three of whom had escaped. Hoppe and the other two were taken to the Soviet zone.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 20th] It is reported that Campoja, the Berlin coal allocation director, was kidnapped by German police in the Soviet zone at his municipal government office. The Soviet authorities had ordered his dismissal several days ago, but Western Allied officials insisted on retaining him in his position.

### Account of the Clash at the Border Between the British and Soviet Zones

[Associated Press, Berlin, 19th] A gunfight occurred between German police at the Potsdam Square intersection of the British and Soviet occupation zones in Berlin at around 6:00 pm on the 19th, resulting in the deaths of at least four German civilians. According to British sources, during a search for black marketeers by Soviet-occupied police in the square, they chased them into the adjacent British-occupied zone. It is said that they fired shots. The German police in the British zone, who had been watching the search, immediately returned fire. An angry crowd of about 4,000 people rushed into the square when the two sides opened fire and began throwing bricks at the police on both sides. They then poured into the Soviet zone, tore down the party flags of the Socialist Unity Party (Communist Party) district branch and the Soviet flag, and burned them. Order was restored only when British and American military police and German reinforcements arrived.

### Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky Returns to Moscow via Prague

### Soviet Union Owes US Debt; Interest Payment Not in Full

[Associated Press, Washington, 19th] US officials recently announced that the interest payment made by the Soviet Union on its US debt is not acceptable to the United States, and the Soviet Union has been asked to make up the remainder. The Soviet Union owes the United States a total of $225 million. The United States issued an invoice to the Soviet Union on July 1, demanding $5 million in interest. Six weeks later, the Soviet Union sent a check for more than $3.34 million. The Soviet debt is based on the price of equipment shipped to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease Act before the victory over Japan. The original contract stipulated that the United States should ship $250 million worth of goods to the Soviet Union, but Congress later ordered the shipments to stop. The Soviet Union claimed that some of the shipped goods were useless and that the debt should be "adjusted."

### United Nations Decides to Establish a Flood Control Bureau in Asia

Economic and Social Council Passes Our Proposal

[Associated Press, Geneva, 19th] The United Nations Economic and Social Council passed a Chinese proposal on the 19th, deciding to establish a United Nations Flood Control Bureau in Asia and the Far East. The United States opposed it, saying that the bureau infringed on the powers of the United Nations Secretary-General. Chinese representative Zhang Pengchun argued reasonably and won the victory. US representative Thorpe advocated establishing a "technical team directly under the Secretary's Office, staffed by flood control experts." As for the Flood Control Bureau, it should be studied by the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, and a report should be submitted to the next meeting of the Economic and Social Council. The Soviet Union and other eleven countries unanimously supported the Chinese proposal, while the United Kingdom, the United States, New Zealand, and Canada voted against it. Zhang Pengchun denied that the Flood Control Bureau would interfere with the powers of the Secretariat, and also said that the US fear that the bureau would become "semi-dominant" was unfounded. "We cannot delay any longer, millions of people are waiting for our decision."

### British and American Air Forces to Hold Joint Large-Scale Exercise in Early September

### Soviet Union Condemns US for Abducting Soviet Teachers; US Rejects Soviet Protest; Formally Submits Note Demanding Recall of Soviet Consul

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] The United States demanded on the 20th that the Soviet Union recall Consul General Lomakin because he took "extremely inappropriate" actions in the case of the three Soviet teachers. The note condemned Lomakin for refusing to allow New York police officers to meet with Mrs. Kasenkina to obstruct police investigations, and for forcing Mrs. Gao to make a false statement that she was willing to return to her country. The note stated: "The United States Government believes that Consul General Lomakin's actions abused the privileges of his position and violated generally accepted standards regarding the actions of diplomatic officials."

Regarding the case of Mrs. Kasenkina and the Saumarins, the US note stated: "According to the investigation report of the appropriate American authorities, not only does it show that the Soviet Union's condemnation of 'abduction' is completely unfounded, but it also shows that officials of the Soviet Government participated in extremely inappropriate actions." The note continued: "The United States 'must unconditionally reject all condemnations and insinuations in the Soviet note, because they are completely inconsistent with the facts.'" The note was signed by Deputy Secretary of State Lovett and delivered to the Soviet Embassy on the evening of the 19th. This is the first diplomatic offensive launched by the US government in the case.

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] The State Department will explain on the 20th the reasons for rejecting the Soviet Union's various accusations and demands regarding the case of the three Soviet teachers. The government sent a note rejecting the Soviet protest to the Soviet Embassy on the evening of the 19th. This is the first diplomatic offensive launched by the government in the case of Mrs. Kasenkina and the Saumarins. The content of the note will be released at 10 pm, which is equivalent to 11 am Shanghai time. State Department Press Officer McDermott said that the note only answers three of the Soviet Union's four protests. He said that the fourth point of the Soviet protest, regarding the issuance of a subpoena to Lomakin, does not actually require an answer.

### Britain Refuses to Send Troops to Help Burma Quell Rebellion

Will Only Send Troops to Protect British Interests

[Associated Press, London, 20th] It is reported that the British government is considering sending troops to Burma to protect British citizens and property and prevent the threat of communist thugs. Officials declined to comment on this. However, officials admitted that the Burmese government had requested British assistance in dealing with the rebellion. The British side has made it clear that they cannot assist Burma militarily, as Burma has become an independent country through universal suffrage. The only thing Britain can do is send troops to Burma to protect British citizens and property, which must be considered.

[Associated Press, Yangon, 20th] As Burmese government forces are intensifying their attacks on the besieged rebels in the suburbs of Yangon, communist propagandists distributed leaflets on the streets of the city on the 20th, warning people that Yangon will soon be occupied by communist troops. One person was arrested while distributing the leaflets.

### Publication of Hopkins' Memoirs Reveals Roosevelt Violated My Wishes at the Tehran Conference and Agreed to the Soviet Use of Dalian Port

[United Press, New York, 19th] Hopkins' memoirs were published today, revealing that President Roosevelt first indicated to Stalin at the Tehran Conference that the Soviet Union could obtain Dalian after the war to meet the Soviet Union's need for an ice-free port.

The famous playwright Sherwood further clarified that this was Roosevelt's first statement on the matter, made in Tehran, not Yalta. (According to general rumors, Roosevelt was so weak at the time that he did not realize the importance of what he was doing.) Stalin immediately expressed the opinion that this suggestion would be opposed by China, but Roosevelt said that he believed they could agree to make Dalian a free port. Sherwood stated, "From my personal understanding, Roosevelt was not merely speculating - in fact, Roosevelt had discussed this issue with President Chiang in Cairo a few days prior."

Afterwards, Hopkins informed Stalin, Churchill, Eden, and Molotov that post-war Pacific bases for the Allies would not be difficult to arrange. Hopkins stated, "We, the American people, do not want to acquire sovereignty over any island liberated from Japan. The United Nations may adopt protective measures for them. As for the Philippines after achieving independence, we still believe that there should be American naval and air bases without the control of the United Nations."

Sherwood stated that a few days later, at the Cairo Conference with Roosevelt, Churchill, and the chiefs of staff of both countries, "Roosevelt felt he should fulfill his promise to President Chiang. Ten days prior, Roosevelt had promised to launch two vigorous campaigns in the Southeast Asian theater, because Stalin's sudden declaration in Tehran that the Soviet Union was willing to join the war against Japan had changed the entire war situation.

Sherwood stated: During the Tehran Conference, Roosevelt told Stalin that his planned post-war United Nations would include: First, a world assembly to discuss world problems. Second, an executive committee, including China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and several small countries, to handle non-military issues. Third, an organization of "international police," including China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, which would have the authority to immediately deal with any event threatening peace. Stalin believed that the suggestion of a four-nation police force would not be willingly accepted by the smaller European countries, because he did not believe that China would be very strong after the end of the war, and even if China became stronger, European countries would not want China to be a coercive power over them. Therefore, he proposed a compromise solution, suggesting that a committee be established in both Europe and the Far East. Roosevelt said that although he was very clear about China's current weakness, he insisted that China must participate in the Moscow Four-Power Declaration, because he was planning for the future and believed that China's 400 million people were friends and not potential enemies."

### The Struggle Between Stalin and Tito (Part Two)

— Translated by this newspaper's editorial office

(Original article published in the July 9th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine)

Then Tito launched a counterattack, rejecting the Soviet accusations in a strongly worded reply in April. He strenuously defended that his policies were best suited to the national conditions of Yugoslavia and did not contradict Marxism-Leninism. At the same time, to avoid giving ammunition to opponents, Tito ordered the immediate nationalization of small industries and retail businesses, and imposed a new grain tax on independent farmers, forcing marginal farmers to join cooperatives, a substitute for Yugoslav collective farms.

Yugoslav Leaders Unwilling to Yield

However, the opposition shifted its ground, defying these orders, arguing that Yugoslavia was not fully prepared, and that if forcibly implemented, the domestic distribution system would be disrupted. This time, Moscow supported the opposition.

What followed was the purge of opposition leaders. On May 6th, Zorgevic and Hebrand were simultaneously dismissed from their cabinet posts and detained. In early June, Zorgevic was further stripped of his lieutenant general rank. According to unconfirmed reports, Hebrand was secretly tried and executed in late June.

Meanwhile, Belgrade received increasingly strongly worded letters from Moscow on May 4th and 22nd. After these two letters were rejected by Tito, the Cominform convened a meeting in Bucharest in late June to discuss the Soviet accusations against Tito.

Thus, Yugoslavia broke off relations with the Cominform. Tito refused to send a representative to the Bucharest meeting. The Cominform passed a resolution, affirming Moscow's accusations, blaming him for not accepting Soviet opinions, and encouraging "ideologically sound" Yugoslav communists to reform his policies, or else simply overthrow him and his leading party members and elect others to replace them.

The result was a counterattack. Marshal Tito was unwilling to yield, denying the Cominform's authority to issue orders to him. He defended the position of his communists, insisted on maintaining closer relations with the Soviet Union, and planned to appeal directly to Stalin to overturn the Cominform's resolution. However, he still rejected all of the Soviet Union's accusations against his government. The leaders of the Yugoslav government, including Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj, united with the Prime Minister to resist Moscow.

The Consequences of the Soviet-Yugoslav Conflict

The result of this matter is: Western countries know that a crack has occurred within the Soviet bloc; satellite states know that it is possible to resist Moscow and break away from it; the Kremlin knows that it has mismanaged the situation and will endanger its greatest gain from World War II, namely the annexation of Eastern Europe to form the Soviet Union's security zone.

Now, both Moscow and Belgrade are in a dilemma, but the door to negotiations between the two sides has not yet closed. They insist that the dispute between the two sides is a dispute between communist parties, not a dispute between the Soviet and Yugoslav governments. Diplomatic relations between the two countries are still tenuous, and the Soviet-Yugoslav alliance remains in effect.

The United States currently has two courses of action to choose from: it can encourage Tito to continue to part ways with Moscow through loans and trade, or sacrifice Yugoslavia's interests and make a deal with the Soviet Union, because Yugoslavia's demands, supported by the Soviet Union, have so far become the biggest obstacle to the Austrian peace treaty and the resolution of the Trieste issue.

However, the US authorities are acting with extreme caution and have not rushed to the conclusion that the split between Moscow and Belgrade is permanent. But throughout the West, no matter how much pressure the Soviet Union exerts on Berlin, the fear of war is gradually dissipating. People generally feel that the Soviet Union is already very busy in Eastern Europe and will have no time to exert pressure on other parts of Europe for some time to come.

### Mayor Calls Meeting of Various Industries Today to Discuss Coordination with the Currency Reform Policy; Prices of Daily Necessities Must Not Be Raised

[Report from this newspaper] Mayor Wu, in order to coordinate with the currency reform policy, has scheduled a meeting with relevant industries in the city at 10:00 AM today. Invitees include the city's Chamber of Commerce, Banking Association, Money Exchange Association, Rice Industry Association, Flour Industry Association, Taiwan Sugar Corporation, Vegetable Industry Association, Department Store Association, Grain Industry Association, Global Goods Industry Association, Rice and Silk Industry Association, Xinle Industry Association, China Vegetable Oil Factory, Fresh Meat Industry Association, Pig Trade Association, and the current chairmen and standing directors of the Import and Export Medicine Association.

Furthermore, Mayor Wu convened the responsible persons of the rice business, grain business, flour and noodle business, oil business, and North and South Rice Markets, including Zhang Xichao, Shan Wenjun, Yang Wenxiong, and Xu Songren, in the City Hall conference room at 11:00 AM yesterday morning for discussions. Mayor Wu inquired about whether there were any problems with the supply of retail outlets during the holiday period for businesses. Each representative reported that the retail business was in a normal state and that citizens would not suffer from having nowhere to buy goods. Mayor Wu also instructed the representatives of each industry that, starting next week, the prices of daily necessities for people's livelihood must not exceed the original prices of August 19th.

### Mayor Wu Speaks: Prices Can Definitely Be Stabilized

[Report from this newspaper] The reporter visited Mayor Wu at his City Hall office at 5:00 PM yesterday to inquire about the measures taken by the municipal government to coordinate with the currency reform. According to him: After the announcement of the currency reform policy, the market situation today is still relatively stable, with only slight fluctuations in retail prices. The reason for this is likely the shortage of cash circulation after the closure of the businesses. Mayor Wu has already convened the responsible persons of various industries for discussions yesterday, instructing them to uniformly convert prices to gold yuan currency units according to the prices of August 19th when they reopen next Monday, and strictly prohibiting price increases during the opportunity. Then, prices will definitely stabilize starting next week.

### Restoring Pre-War Standards: Two Railways Discuss Fares

[Report from this newspaper] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau convened a temporary bureau affairs meeting yesterday to review the issue of passenger and freight fares after the currency reform. According to Article 3 of the "Measures for Consolidating Finances and Strengthening Economic Controls," the fees for state-owned public utility and transportation enterprises that are lower than pre-war standards are allowed to be adjusted with reference to pre-war standards in order to achieve self-sufficiency. If so, the fares of the two railways will generally increase by about one time, because the first-class ticket price from Beijing to Shanghai before the war was 11 yuan and 8 jiao, and the current ticket price converted to gold currency is only more than 6 yuan. The bureau is currently awaiting instructions from the Ministry of Transportation.

### Public Utility Prices: Difficult to Meet Pre-War Standards

[Report from this newspaper] According to the person in charge of the Public Utilities Bureau: After the currency reform, it is feared that the prices of public utilities will still be difficult to restore to pre-war original prices, because the prices of fuels used by public utilities have risen too much. For example, kerosene has risen six times compared to before the war, and diesel has also risen five times. It is also difficult to balance other metal indexes, so the prices of public utilities are difficult to approach pre-war levels.

### Difficulties in Reducing Automobiles

Regarding the Central Government's announcement today that one-quarter of automobile licenses will be cancelled in the future, relevant persons from the Public Utilities Bureau stated that it is very difficult to implement in Shanghai, because most of the automobiles in the city belong to the privileged class. If strict implementation is desired, it is inevitable to offend people, so it is expected that it will be difficult to implement.

### Military Police Ordered to Catch Speculators: Proceeding According to Drafted Blacklist

It is reported that: The military medical authorities were ordered to convene a joint meeting at 7:00 PM on the 19th, deciding to launch actions related to prices today. According to the drafted blacklist, a large number of speculators will be arrested. This work of arresting speculators must be completed before Sunday of this week, in order to curb speculators from making waves when businesses reopen next Monday.

[Another report] The Economic Police Brigade of the Police Bureau divided into 20 groups at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, and went to the city's major markets to monitor and investigate general price reactions, and to severely crack down on stores that raise prices without reason and illegal silver dollar trading. The Gold Management Bureau also dispatched 15 inspection teams, two people per team, to various banks and money exchanges yesterday morning to monitor and prohibit any deposit and storage behavior.

### Yuegu Bonnie Nylon Stockings: Economic and Social Bureau Marks for Return

The director of the Textile Department of the Social Bureau went to the factory to investigate and confirmed that it was true. The nylon stockings seized yesterday were returned. However, the Social Bureau will pay attention to the following two items of the factory in the future: (1) Prevent the smuggling of imported goods, (2) The products manufactured by the factory should have a special trademark for identification.

### China Airlines Passenger Tickets: Method of Attaching Photos Canceled

[Report from this newspaper] China Airlines previously attached photos to passenger tickets sold by the company when purchasing tickets, and verified them upon boarding to prevent profiteering through black market resales after being purchased in bulk. It is now learned that: This method has been notified by the company to all stations across the country to be canceled from today. The reason is said to be that the general public believes that the procedure is too cumbersome and there are many complaints. The company had to announce the cancellation of this method, and passengers who purchase tickets will no longer need to attach photos.

### Printing Office Manager Jumps from Building: Five Workers Involved in Incident Dismissed, Three Each Receive One Major Demerit

[Report from this newspaper] Workers at the Shanghai Kuiji Printing Office previously surrounded Zou Chengyi, the manager of the office, due to a dispute over the calculation of wage indexes. Zou was accustomed to this and jumped from the building to commit suicide. He was rescued but not killed, but suffered serious injuries. After the Social Bureau investigated this matter, it decided yesterday to dismiss the five workers involved in the incident at the office, including Wang Bingquan, Shen Jinrong, Chen Quancun, Zhao Qiquan, and Zhang Nianxin, and Shen Xueming, Mei Jinhai, and Wang Lisheng each received one major demerit.

### After Currency Reform: New Standard for Rent: Land Administration Bureau to Discuss Next Week: Likely Not Higher Than Pre-War

[Report from this newspaper] After the currency reform, regarding how to calculate the rent standard in the city, the reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Land Administration Bureau yesterday. According to him: After the announcement of the currency reform news, the Land Bureau is still considering the rent revision method. However, two situations may occur in the city, that is, the landlord requests to calculate the rent amount in gold yuan currency according to the pre-war rent amount, and the tenant requests to calculate the rent amount in gold yuan currency according to the current rent amount paid. If the former is followed, then the general public cannot afford it. If the latter is followed, then the rent can be as low as only worth a few jiao in gold yuan currency. Therefore, the determination of the new rent standard should be based on the income situation of the general public, so that the tenant can afford the rent, and at the same time the landlord's reasonable income must also be taken into account, so that they have the interest in investing in building new houses. However, in any case, the new rent amount should be lower than the pre-war rent amount.

The Land Administration Bureau will invite relevant parties in the city to hold a symposium next week to discuss the rent issue after the currency reform. After the principles are decided in the meeting, a method will be drafted and submitted to the municipal government for approval before implementation. Therefore, the rent for this month will still be calculated according to the current standard.

### Beijing-Shanghai Mixed Train Derails at Louxia Mountain Station: All Trains Halted for Five Hours

The 58th train on the Beijing-Shanghai line derailed near Qixia Mountain yesterday, and all trains were blocked, and traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai line was halted for five hours.

The 58th mixed train of the 3rd and 4th class on the Beijing-Shanghai line departed from Shanghai to Beijing at 6:55 PM the day before yesterday. Due to traffic congestion along the way, the train was delayed all the way. It arrived near Qixia Mountain Station, 290 kilometers from Shanghai, at 9:42 AM yesterday. Unfortunately, the P4-538 locomotive suddenly derailed, and the first two wheels of the 30-ton CW380037 freight car behind the locomotive also derailed. After this incident occurred, the head of Qixia Mountain Station urgently telegraphed Nanjing and the Qishuyan Locomotive Factory for assistance. The Qishuyan Locomotive Factory urgently dispatched a 45-ton crane to the scene to rescue. At that time, the 54th passenger train of the 3rd and 4th class also arrived at Qixia Mountain. It immediately used the locomotive to drag all the carriages that had not derailed behind the 58th train back to Qixia Mountain at 11:40 AM. After the repairs, traffic was restored at 3:45 PM. Yesterday, due to the accident of the 58th train near Qixia Mountain, the 15th express train of the first, second and third class from Beijing to Shanghai (departing at 1:05 PM), the 86th passenger train of the second and third class from Zhenjiang to Beijing (departing at 1:00 PM), and the 87th intercity train of the second and third class from Beijing to Zhenjiang (departing at 12:15 PM) were all suspended.

The 206th streamlined express train from Shanghai to Beijing was also blocked when it arrived near Qixia Mountain. All passengers were transferred by the railway bureau to a special train from Qixia Mountain to Nanjing and transported to Xiaguan Station. At the same time, traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai line was halted for five hours, and thousands of passengers gathered at Nanjing Xiaguan Station. The railway bureau specially added the 251st temporary special train on the Beijing-Shanghai line at 3:15 PM, stopping at major stations along the way, including Zhenjiang, Danyang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Kunshan. As for the cause of the derailment, the railway bureau is thoroughly investigating.

It is learned that: the new compilation will take the pre-war budget of each bureau and office as the standard, but the treatment of civil servants will be discounted and paid according to the regulations promulgated by the central government, which is very different from before the war. The new budget of each bureau and office will be completed by the end of this month.

The reporter interviewed Li Ximou, director of the Education Bureau, after the municipal government meeting yesterday, and asked about the school fee standards. He replied: A meeting of school principals from the city will be convened within the next week to discuss and decide. He said: Mayor Wu urged the Education Bureau the other day to set the school fees as soon as possible. He originally planned to decide and announce them within a few days, but now it will have to be redetermined. The method of converting school fees into food rice will be cancelled from now on. Director Li also said: The charging standard for the next semester will be based on the pre-war school fees as a principle.

The cost of living index for the second half of this month in the city will no longer be published in accordance with the government's order. Regarding the wage calculation method for each factory, Wu Kaixian, director of the Social Bureau, went to Beijing yesterday to request a reasonable method from the government.

According to Zhao Banfu, deputy director of the Social Bureau, when he met with reporters yesterday morning, the Social Bureau has started to draft a method for calculating workers' wages after the currency reform. This method is expected to be announced around the 23rd.

### Fell and Died in Cooling Off on Riverbank Iron Railing

[Report from this newspaper] On the iron railing along the Suzhou River at the west end of the old garbage bridge on North Zhejiang Road, there were many people cooling off due to the hot weather. At about 9:00 PM last night, a person named Lu Changfa, 42 years old, residing at No. 7, Changkang Lane, Qufu Road, was cooling off on the iron railing with neighbors.

### Inmates Call for Amnesty: Investigation Shows Communist Party Involvement: Strict Precautions Taken in Various Prisons of the District Court

[Report from this newspaper] The Ministry of Judicial Administration recently found that inmates in prisons in Taicang, Changshu, Songjiang, Yuyao in Zhejiang, and Yibin in Sichuan even jointly printed and distributed documents calling for amnesty. After investigation, it was found that they were Communist Party traitors who, during the period of suppressing the rebellion, used the crime of committing ordinary crimes as a cover to illegally carry out activities in prison on the chance. The various prisons of the District Court in the city have also recently discovered the above situation. The court has strictly isolated them and taken proper precautions, and has carefully examined the daily words and deeds and correspondence of the detained prisoners and conducted serious inspections.

### Optimism Expressed by Various Circles in This City Regarding the New Fiscal Consolidation Measures; Hope for Sincere Implementation to Earn Public Trust

Following the government's promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs and the implementation of currency reform, reactions from all quarters in this city have been extremely positive. A reporter from the Central News Agency, in order to understand the reactions of leading figures from various sectors to these measures, specifically conducted interviews to solicit opinions, which are recorded below:

Qiu Liangrong

Mr. Qiu Liangrong, Secretary-General of the China International Trade Association, stated: "Any economic activity can only be healthy under currency stability, and international trade is no exception. In the future, with stable currency values, stable prices, and lower market interest rates, domestic finance will be active, and imports and exports can be expected to have reasonable profits, no longer becoming speculative transactions as in the past. Only then can international trade be sound and develop upwards. While we are delighted, we deeply hope that the government will improve its import and export trade policies and ensure that all facilities are aimed at assisting exports and encouraging production. All institutions and procedures that do not meet these needs should be eliminated. At the same time, all gold, silver, foreign currencies, and foreign assets owned by the people must be transferred under the government's control according to law. The government will not worry about a lack of foreign exchange. I hope that national banks will only focus on how to use financial power to help people engage in profitable trade, and no longer directly participate in purchasing and selling businesses. For secondary export materials and materials that are difficult for merchants to operate, the government should assist merchants in various ways to promote trade, increase foreign exchange income, and benefit the stability of the currency system."

Wu Yun Chu

Mr. Wu Yun Chu, Chairman of the National Industrial Association, stated: "The Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs promulgated by the President on August 19, and the various methods formulated to deal with hoarding, speculation, and the rampant trading of gold and US dollars, are indeed a symptomatic remedy. The conversion rate of the legal tender is also appropriate. The resolute implementation is truly a major event worthy of special mention in our country's economic history. Based on the brief opinions I have at the moment, I believe that: (1) The current state of the country and society, chronic diseases are deep-rooted, and there are too many sources of disease. It seems unwise to expect a single dose of drastic medicine to cure chronic illnesses. (2) Since the government's plan has been announced and determined to be implemented, it must be implemented effectively and 100% to gain the trust of the general public. If trust is lost, it will repeat the mistakes of the legal tender. (3) There are still many minor details, such as: (A) The worker index in Shanghai has already exceeded three million. Abolishing the index may inevitably lead to disputes during implementation; (B) Living indexes vary in different regions, meaning the value of the legal tender also varies. The current uniform conversion at a rate of three million times should consider the ways of adjusting surpluses and deficits; (C) If loan interest rates are lowered, should the interest rates on short-term treasury bills also be lowered; (D) After this news spread last night, the prices of daily necessities and food in the vegetable markets have soared today. This may be a temporary phenomenon, but it is worth noting. There may be many other similar matters."

Zhu Si Huang

Professor Zhu Si Huang, Head of the Banking Department at Fudan University and Secretary of the Banking Association, stated: "The new currency used this time is called the Gold Yuan. However, how to maintain the value of this Gold Yuan in the long term, and how to fully implement the various measures stipulated in the measures for reorganizing finances and strengthening economic control, such as balancing fiscal revenue and expenditure and saving consumption, are all prerequisites. This reform is completely different from the reform when managed currency was implemented in the 24th year of the Republic (1935). The reason why currency value could be stabilized at that time was that legal tender could buy and sell foreign exchange without restriction. The true essence of a pseudo-gold standard lies in this. The fundamental foundation still lies in reducing consumption, increasing production, and establishing national credibility."

Song Binglun

Mr. Song Binglun, Executive Director of the Shanghai Import and Export Chamber of Commerce, stated: "(1) According to Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the Measures for Handling Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People, and Article 10, Paragraph 2 of the Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets, gold, silver, and foreign currency are converted into US dollars at the exchange rate, and the funds deposited in the Central Bank can be used to pay for imported goods with import permits. This is equivalent to partially opening up self-provided foreign exchange. If import permits can be issued in coordination, the panic over important production equipment and industrial raw materials needed by factories in the future has been remedied. (2) The current difficulty in export trade is the low prices abroad. The authorities are currently seeking countermeasures. If there are remedial measures, coupled with the new situation after the currency reform, if prices can remain stable in the long term, export trade will naturally have a future."

Sun Churen

Mr. Sun Churen, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Banking Association, stated: "The greatest advantage of currency reform is that everything conforms to the actual market situation, and there is no loss to the people. For example, 3 million legal tender is exchanged for 1 Gold Yuan, and 4 Gold Yuan is exchanged for 1 US dollar, while the market price of a US dollar is exactly 12 million legal tender. There is no gain or loss in mutual exchange. Also, 200 Gold Yuan is exchanged for each tael of gold, which is also in line with the market price of 600 million legal tender. As for the total issuance amount being limited to 2 billion yuan, and the powers of the 'Gold Yuan Currency Issuance Reserve Supervision Committee' being particularly expanded, such as monthly 'inspections,' 'reports,' and 'public announcements,' if these matters are handled particularly conscientiously, the future should be worry-free. What is hoped is that if the two ends of 'balancing the national budget' and 'balancing international payments' can be firmly grasped, then 'managing the economy' and 'stabilizing prices' can also be successfully completed."

Shui Xiangyun

Mr. Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, stated: "The people of the whole country should unanimously support this currency reform. If prices can truly become stable in the future, workers will feel supreme welfare. If prices still fluctuate and the worker index has been frozen, they will feel uneasy."

### General Opinions of the Industrial Sector

[Our News] The opinions of the industrial sector on currency reform can be summarized into the following points: (1) The government must control more quantities of materials for large-scale sales and supply to the market. Once prices are set, they should not be adjusted at any time. State-owned enterprise materials such as sugar from Taiwan Sugar Corporation, yarn from Textile Construction Corporation, oil from China Plantation Corporation, household rationed rice, and coal for industrial use should be supplied to the market at stable prices for a long time. Only then can the effect of suppressing and stabilizing prices be achieved. (2) Public transportation should maintain current prices. (3) Bank loan interest rates should also be reduced to the pre-war standard of 1.8% or 0.6%. (4) The difficulty felt by the industrial sector is that after converting funds into gold currency, it is necessary to readjust and increase capital again. In this way, dividend expenses will greatly increase. (5) If prices cannot be stabilized as desired after the cancellation of the living index, there will be endless troubles. It is hoped that the government will pay attention to this as soon as possible.

The Government Must Sell a Large Quantity of Materials; Bank Loan Interest Rates Should Be Reduced

### Strict Prohibition of Parades and Petitions; The General Labor Union Notifies Its Subordinates After Receiving Orders

During the sixth general meeting of the first session of the Municipal Council, elementary school teachers repeatedly petitioned the council and the Education Bureau. However, their representatives neither declared their identities nor were willing to sign according to regulations. Their actions clearly showed signs of disrupting order. If they were allowed to continue unchecked, it would not only hinder public security but also affect the suppression of the rebellion. After the council's resolution, and the determination of three measures, a letter was sent to the municipal government to strictly prohibit such actions in order to quell the source of the chaos. Yesterday, the Municipal General Labor Union received the above instructions and has notified all industry unions accordingly. The original three measures are recorded as follows: (1) Petitioning groups must strictly comply with central regulations, and their representatives must not exceed ten people. (2) Petitioning representatives must carry their national identity cards, professional certificates, and proof of the group they represent. (3) If there are any more mass petitions, the police局 should strictly stop them.

### Shipping Industry to Discuss Adjustment of Freight Rates Today

After the government announced the currency reform and measures to strengthen economic control and consolidate finances, all transportation agencies in this city expressed optimism about the future. All passenger and cargo ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are operating as usual. However, with banks closed, all departments feel a lack of cash. Fortunately, there is some income from passenger ticket sales, and passengers purchased tickets in advance, so ticket sales have not decreased due to the bank closures. According to the initial estimate of the company, the current prices of passenger and cargo transport are lower than the pre-war freight rates. Whether adjustments are needed and how to adjust them are currently being studied in detail. At the same time, they are awaiting instructions from the Ministry of Communications. The Shipowners Association and the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association are scheduled to hold a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 8:30 am on the 21st to discuss everything.

At the same time, residents Jin Shuqin and Zhang Yitang also filed lawsuits. After the court opened for investigation, the case has now been concluded.

### Re-investigation and Prosecution of Three Defendants for Obstructing Freedom in Shanghai Guang Middle School Lease Dispute

[Our News] In January of this year, Qin Weibin, the person in charge of Shanghai Guang Middle School, intended to restore the school. Through the introduction of his friend Liang Zhishen, he leased all twelve rooms on the three floors of No. 527 Haifang Road in this city from Yin Zhiling. It was agreed that the monthly rent would be 25 stones of white rice, a three-month security deposit, and a guarantee of 350 million yuan. Both parties signed a draft lease agreement. On February 14, Yin verbally agreed that Qin could advertise for enrollment and start working on the second floor of the building first, stating that the entire third floor could be vacated by the 23rd at the latest. On February 16, Qin moved in some school equipment and started working on the second floor. On the afternoon of the same day, he delivered 180 million legal tender, which was the equivalent of 100 stones of glutinous rice (25 stones of glutinous rice plus three months of deposit), to Yin. The next day, due to a sudden and drastic fluctuation in prices, Yin wanted Qin to convert the 350 million yuan guarantee into three and a half gold bars, but Qin refused. Yin was unhappy. On the 20th, Yin refused to allow Qin to move in school equipment and called Yin Xiaolong and Liu Jun to help block Qin from entering. As a result, a lawsuit was filed in court. The High Prosecutor's Office has recently issued an order to the District Prosecutor's Office to conduct an investigation. The investigation has now been completed, and Yin and the other two have been prosecuted on charges of obstructing freedom.

### Jiang Renlin Upheld Original Verdict; Hou Aichang Declared Not Guilty After Retrial in Embezzlement Case of Xingzong Staff

[Our News] In the embezzlement and fraud case of Hou Aichang, former manager of the Xingzong Material Purchasing and Sales Office, and Jiang Renlin, head of the Welfare Section, the District Court's initial verdict sentenced Hou and Jiang to three years and six months of imprisonment each. Both refused to accept the verdict and applied for a retrial in the High Court. After the High Court remanded the case to the District Court for a retrial, Judge Wu Xiangzu concluded the retrial and announced the verdict yesterday: Jiang Renlin embezzled public property and was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment, with deprivation of civil rights for four years. Hou Aichang was found not guilty. The reasoning stated that Jiang Renlin had used 178,080 yuan from the 5 million yuan of working capital under his custody, which was not approved for reimbursement. The handling clerk Chen Tingchang concealed the facts and could not be brought to court to provide evidence favorable to the defendant. His defense was untenable. The defendant clearly had embezzled public property and should be sentenced in accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 2 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption. However, after investigation, the amount of embezzlement was not large, and the circumstances were pitiful. His sentence should be reduced by one-half. For Hou Aichang, the High Court remanded the case with the intention of investigating how much wool was allocated to Anle and Zhanghua during the defendant's management period and what specific facts benefited Anle. After inquiring about the contracts signed by the defendant with the factory, the prices, and the allocation methods, there were no benefits. Therefore, he was declared not guilty.

### Civil Affairs Bureau to Convene Conscription Task Force Research Conference Today

At that time, the bureau's recently drafted "Shanghai Implementation Regulations for Regular Conscription and Family Support Plan" will be carefully reviewed and discussed. The Regiment Management District and the North Station District Office have already provided written opinions. Because the new preferential plan has a significant impact on future conscripted soldiers and their families, there will be heated debates and discussions today. After the task force decides on the principles of the plan, the revised draft will be submitted to the municipal conference's military association standing committee for discussion and approval before being promulgated and implemented.

### Zhang Mingyuan's Drug Trafficking Case Changed to Lengthy Imprisonment

### Market Tour: Vegetable Market Prices Slightly Chaotic

[Our News] After the currency reform was announced and implemented, the prices of vegetables, meat, and other items in the small vegetable markets of this city yesterday morning varied greatly. Most vegetable vendors and butchers were still unclear about the content of the currency reform. Many were at a loss when setting up stalls in the early morning, and the opinions of one or two vendors often influenced the prices of the entire vegetable market. In general, prices were more standardized in the vegetable markets in bustling areas, while prices were more chaotic in the vegetable markets attached to remote residential areas. However, the prices of fish, meat, and vegetables in small vegetable markets have been rising almost every day for the past two or three weeks, and the rise has been particularly severe in recent days. Therefore, yesterday morning's fluctuations can be seen as a continuation of the trend from the previous few days. The highest price for fresh pork was 3 million yuan per catty, but some still sold it for 2.2 million yuan. Most small vegetable markets were priced between 2.4 million, 2.6 million, and 2.8 million yuan. The highest price for beef was 2 million yuan per catty, and the lowest was 1.4 million yuan, an average increase of 10% to 20% compared to the previous day. Eggs ranged from 140,000 yuan to 180,000 yuan each, depending on size. Large duck eggs were 200,000 yuan, an increase of about 20,000 yuan per egg compared to the previous day. Green vegetables, bean sprouts, and edamame were all 200,000 yuan per catty, and some were 250,000 yuan per catty. The prices of other items were slightly higher than the previous day's market prices.

However, they believe that it will have a great impact on their future business. They are eagerly awaiting the government to promptly make regulations on whether people can freely purchase gold jewelry without restriction in the future, and where they can obtain the gold and silver on which their business depends. They believe that the turnover of the industry in the future may be less than one-tenth of the pre-war level.

Entertainment Industry Revived: Can Restore Prosperity

In the entertainment industry, cinemas were the first to express their excitement about the currency exchange news.

### War Against Aphids

— Our Reporter Zhao Zhan

[Our Newspaper, Yang Village, 19th Dispatch] At the end of July, when this reporter visited the rural areas of Liaozhong, farmers pointed out the harm caused by honeybugs (aphids). At that time, the disaster was still minor, and everyone eagerly hoped for rain. Farmers are most endearing, suffering from natural disasters yet hoping for salvation from nature.

In less than half a month, a severe aphid disaster has brewed, affecting all seven counties surrounding Shenyang. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented. It is estimated that the affected agricultural area in each county is about five million mu. Only sorghum has been damaged, with an average yield of only about 50 percent. Beans and millet are fortunately unaffected. However, sorghum is the main crop in the Northeast, and the disaster of aphids competing with humans for food has become a reality, which is indeed a blow to Shenyang's goal of a moderately prosperous society. Originally, farmers dreamed beautiful summer night dreams while looking at fields of green sorghum. Now, they are watching the sorghum ears being eroded by aphids and shedding tears of sorrow.

Exceptionally Strong Reproduction

According to experts, there are many kinds of small insects. This pest is called aphid, belonging to the order Diptera. Its reproductive capacity is extremely strong, and it can reproduce more than ten to twenty generations in a year. The morphology and habits of each generation are different. Based on the shape and habits, they can be divided into winged aphids and wingless aphids. Winged aphids often move, while wingless aphids settle in one place. According to the season, they can be divided into summer parasites and winter parasites. Summer parasites live on gramineous plants, while winter parasites live on rosaceous plants. Because they like to congregate and secrete viscous liquid, they weaken and shrink the tissues of the host plants, causing poor development and affecting fruiting.

Four Medicines to Treat Aphids

The small aphids have caused great trouble to the people here, so they began to study methods of killing the insects. The Agricultural and Water Conservancy Department of the Political Committee drafted "Simple Methods for Treating and Eliminating Aphids," which listed four effective medicines: (1) Dilifensu soap solution, (2) Dilisi soap solution, (3) Tobacco water, and (4) Soap solution. It explains the method of preparation. The budget for this compound soap solution is 2 billion circulation coupons. The Municipal Council also expressed public opinion, telegraphing the Executive Yuan to immediately allocate and transport a large batch of buckwheat seeds, airlifting them to Shenyang, and advocating that farmers grow vegetables as compensation. In addition, experiments are being conducted to use DDT to kill insects, and it is planned to airlift a large amount of DDT powder from Qingdao to Shenyang to spray on nearby counties by plane. This war against insects is clearly very intense.

Severe Sorghum Field Disaster

The work of killing aphids has already begun in the suburbs of the city. According to statistics from the municipal government, the area planted with sorghum in the suburbs of the city is 26,863 mu, which has been the most severely affected and is now withered and yellow. The municipal government has purchased 40 sprayers and sent them to various districts to mobilize farmers to spray Dilisi insecticide solution.

Seize the Opportunity to Alleviate the Food Shortage

Guo Keti, Director of the Liaoning Construction Department, went to the four rural areas of Shenyang on the 9th to investigate the insect disaster. According to him, preliminary investigations showed that the loss of sorghum due to the insect disaster was 30%, and there was still hope for a harvest, so he was not very pessimistic. The authorities are trying to find remedies. However, an agricultural research friend told me that the time to spray aphids has passed, and the effect is minimal. The remedy should be to sow buckwheat, but the buckwheat seeds have not yet arrived, and I am afraid the opportunity will be missed. It is best to plant cabbage and radishes, so as to slightly alleviate the food shortage.

### Tragic Incident of a Poor Student in Haikou City - Save the Children!

Tuition Fees Are Too High - He Suddenly Had Suicidal Thoughts - He Jumped Off a Building and His Brain Splattered - Lin Riyue Composed Two Suicide Notes with Tears

[Our Newspaper, Haikou, 17th Dispatch] At about 5:00 a.m. on the 11th, a corpse was found in the garden of the Qiongya Bookstore on Deshengsha Road. The back of the head was broken, the right hand was fractured, the right leg bone protruded from the knee, all the bones in the body were broken, and the abdomen was swollen, which was extremely frightening. After investigation, it was learned that the deceased jumped from the sun deck of the Hainan Travel Agency on the fifth floor. Next to the sun deck railing, a few empty wine bottles and peanut shells were found, indicating that the deceased had undoubtedly drunk heavily before committing suicide. Upon further inspection of the deceased's room, two suicide notes were found, one addressed to Shi Jiande, a student in the Mandarin Conversation Class of the Moral Education Association, and the other to his father, Lin Tingjing. The contents of the two letters are recorded below:

(1) Letter to Mr. Shi Jiande:

"Teacher Shi Jiande: A student's intention is to achieve future goals through studying. Now that I cannot continue my studies, my future prospects are truly unimaginable. A young person must have great ambition to have hope for further studies in the future. A young person like this who cannot achieve the goal of studying can only commit suicide, which can also serve as an example for the average young person. Your student, Lin Riyue."

(2) Letter to Father Lin Tingjing:

"Dad: I never imagined that I would end my life like this. Please forgive my unfilial behavior. I am saying goodbye forever with tears in my eyes. Your son, Lin Riyue."

In addition, there was a note that read, "Ambitious young people! If you cannot achieve your goals of seeking knowledge, you must have such courage to be worthy of being a modern young person. I am forced by circumstances and have no choice but to commit suicide."

According to this reporter's investigation, the deceased was Lin Riyue, also known as Lin Minglong, over 20 years old, from Wenchang County. He was a student in the Mandarin Conversation Class of the Deyu School on Xinxing Road in this city. Recently, he had asked his father, Lin Tingjing, to continue his studies, but his father was a salaried worker with a meager monthly income, and the tuition fees for the next semester were too high, so he did not agree. The deceased was extremely discouraged by this. He had returned to his hometown a few days ago, spending a lot of money. His father reprimanded him harshly for wasting his studies and money. Unexpectedly, he had suicidal thoughts. At about 10:00 p.m. on the 8th, he went to Room 508 on the fifth floor of the Hainan Travel Agency, and stayed with a woman. The next morning, he sent the woman away and did not go out all day. On the evening of the 10th, he dressed up and went out. After a while, he returned with a bottle of wine. He walked in the corridor, seemingly lost in deep thought. At about 9:00 p.m., he went back to his room to sleep. At about 11:00 p.m., the tea attendant saw that his room door was still not closed, so he entered the room to check. At that time, the deceased was already fast asleep. Little did he know that the tragedy would happen in the early morning.

### Good News from the Allied Banner's Suppression of Bandits - General Manager Sa Encountered Danger Awaiting Rescue

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th Dispatch] Information from the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. The Commission received a telegram from the Chahar Provincial Government yesterday, reporting on the bandit situation in the Left Banner of Taipusi and the victorious situation of the Allied Banner Security Team in suppressing the bandits. The original telegram is recorded as follows: (1) According to Baoligeler, the head of the security team of the Duolun Lama Printing Office, in a report from Zhangjiakou on the 12th of this month: "At 12:00 on the 8th of this month, more than 200 bandits suddenly surrounded the camp of General Manager Teng of the Left Banner of Taipusi. A part of the banner's security team near the banner government had gone to Ming'an Banner with Team Leader Wen Gai last month to suppress the bandits, leaving only about 30 people. They engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits for two hours. In the end, due to the disparity in numbers, General Manager Sa and the team leader were captured. General Manager Sa's wife was stabbed in two places and seriously injured. One soldier was killed and two were injured, and all property was looted." In addition to ordering Bao Lengnamjile, the deputy commander of the first district security force of the League Banner stationed in Baochang, and Wen Gai, the captain, to quickly investigate the whereabouts of General Manager Sa and others and find a way to rescue them, an pacification payment of 100 million yuan was also issued to General Manager Sa.

[Our Newspaper, Hengyang, 14th Dispatch] (1) After the autumn harvest in Hengyang, the climate is hot like fire, and typhoid fever and dysentery are prevalent, with more children suffering. (2) Hengyang is celebrating a bumper harvest, and a large amount of new rice is on the market. Rice prices are falling daily, with top-quality rice at 240 million yuan per stone and brown rice at 160 million yuan per stone.

### Between Zhengzhou and Xinxiang

— Our Special Reporter, Ling Songshou

[Our Newspaper, Xinxiang, 16th Dispatch] After the Longhai Railway was dismantled, northern Henan became the rear of the isolated islands of Zhengzhou and Bianliang. Since the controlled area of northern Henan is larger than that south of the Yellow River, northern Henan has shouldered a greater responsibility for supplying the military.

While streamlined, air-conditioned trains are advancing victoriously on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, it is pitiful that this section of the Pinghan Railway, less than 100 kilometers long, still clings to a few locomotives and dilapidated open cars that can no longer be used to carry out the task of connecting Zhengzhou and Bianliang with northern Henan, staggering north and south of the Yellow River.

However, please do not underestimate it. Although the mileage is short, the energy spent on this section of railway is no less than that spent on the entire Pinghan Railway in peacetime. Take the rails, for example: from light rails of eight kilograms and sixteen kilograms to standard rails of forty-two kilograms and forty-three kilograms, in terms of length, from six meters to ten point nine meters, almost more than forty kinds of rails are all available on this section, which can be considered a rail exhibition. Take the sleepers, for example: on the section from the north bank of the Yellow River to Xiaoji Station, the sleepers have long been decayed and grown bacteria. After being constantly crushed by vehicles, the ends on both sides of the rails have been raised. To replace them, there is not only no money, but also no materials. The sleepers used for the emergency repairs on the Xin-Jiao section are still a stopgap measure, that is, even the most common stones are difficult to obtain. The Xin-Zheng section originally only went north to Xinxiang, but for the sake of stones, it was extended another twenty kilometers north to Luwangfen, which only solved the stone shortage. Otherwise, when the water level of the Yellow River rises this autumn, the bridge foundation of the Yellow River Bridge will not have stone protection, and traffic will be impossible. However, north of Xinxiang, the security is not very good, and trains are often attacked by the "Eighth Route" bandits with cold guns. Meng Renshan, the driver foreman of the Zheng'an Locomotive Depot, pointed out the bullet marks on the locomotive to me. This happened half a month ago, and the locomotive was almost destroyed. This time, five railway workers were killed or injured.

The biggest problem is still coal. The major mines in western Henan have been lost, and the smaller ones cannot supply enough. After the Xin-Jiao Road was cut off, the Qin River breached its banks, and the flood spread throughout Xinxiang and Jiaozuo. Coal cannot be transported out, and the eastern section of the Longhai Road has not yet been repaired. The limited amount of Jiajiang coal that is available restricts the number of trains between Xinxiang and Zhengzhou to only three round trips per week. The railway authorities are constantly paying attention to the coal reserves, counting on their fingers how long they can last.

My ten-minute conversation with Li Xueyi, the director of the Zhengzhou Office of the Pinghan Railway, revealed these many problems. The next day I took a train north, and the miserable carriages were filled with countless miserable passengers.

When the train reached the south bank of the Yellow River, the garrison had to inspect the passengers, and the inspection took one or two hours. After the victory, the military did indeed spend a lot of effort to protect this bridge, which was over thirty years old and had passed its insurance period. I hoped to take a picture, and after the stationmaster asked the regimental commander of a certain garrison for instructions, the result was not allowed. I got off the train, and the bald Mang Mountain was facing me. The concrete bunkers under the mountain accompanied the residents who lived in the cave dwellings and lived in the smell of earth all year round. In front of one or two cave dwelling doors, there were still faded spring couplets, which read: "The times are peaceful and prosperous, and people live long and healthy lives."

I took a short rest with Yang Hongshu, an inspector, He Jibin, the stationmaster of the North Peak Station of the Yellow River, and Li Guozhen, an engineer, in the stationmaster's office of the South Peak Station. They all reported in unison on the hardship of their lives. Their wives and children had all moved to the countryside to save some expenses. In terms of food, they said that they had not tasted meat for three months.

The train arrived in Xinxiang after a delay of one hour and thirty-five minutes.

Xinxiang has obviously increased its importance since the construction of the Daoqing Road. The enemy's ambition was even greater, and he built the Bianxin branch line, simply wanting to replace Zhengzhou's position with Xinxiang, because at that time Xinxiang was their direct westward base to the Taihang Mountains. The several wide roads in Xinxiang were all opened up by the enemy, and the several tall Western-style buildings were all built by the enemy. Therefore, DDT has been sold all over the country, but the people of Xinxiang still use the "Fly-B-Dead" invented by the enemy to drive away mosquitoes and flies, even though it is counterfeit.

When I arrived in Xinxiang, it was just after County Magistrate Li Kuiguang was removed from his post and investigated by the Sui District. This was the first shot of the Henan Sui District using its powers after the implementation of total war. County Magistrate Li was said to have been removed from his post because a section chief of the county government trafficked military supplies to bandits, and the county magistrate was suspected of collusion. The Xinxiang Senate listed eight major crimes. According to what was said above, Li Kuiguang was simply guilty of capital punishment. The incoming County Magistrate Xia Zhiying was the director of the Economic Department of the Twelfth Sui District Administrative Office, a native of Xinxiang. He told me that as soon as he took office, he first laid off more than 1,500 redundant employees of county-level agencies. In addition, he thoroughly investigated the accounts of the four security districts in the urban and rural areas. One of the district chiefs had embezzled 13,500 jin of wheat in less than two months in office, which, at the current price, was equivalent to more than 24 billion yuan. The normal expenditure in the district accounts included their cigarettes, bathing, and entertainment expenses.

The corruption of the district and town chiefs has become an even greater trauma for the people of Xinxiang on top of the burden of government corvée. A shop owner talked to me. He had some land in the countryside, and the district office sent food and money, all of which were negotiable. From the autumn of last year to the spring of this year, his fields should have been taxed 567 jin of grain, but the district chief promised to settle the matter with 420 jin. He asked the district chief: What will you do with the more than 100 jin that are paid less? The district chief replied wonderfully: Because I was worried that each household would not be able to pay enough, I had to levy more and leave a way out.

When I went to Xinxiang, the Chamber of Commerce and the Guild were arguing over the apportionment. In the past, all provincial public grain, county public grain, and military grain purchase price differences were traditionally borne by the business community by 25% and by the land by 75%. But now the big stores are closed, and the Chamber of Commerce requested an adjustment of the ratio. After three months of consultation, it was decided that the Chamber of Commerce would bear 15% and the Farmers' Association would bear 85%. As a result, the Chamber of Commerce apportioned 8,000 shi of public grain and military grain from January to May of this year according to regulations. Suddenly, the Farmers' Association did not recognize the new ratio and wanted to overturn the previous agreement. The stores protested by closing the market. The Commissioner's Office was busy entertaining guests, and Commissioner Zhang Jingzhong mediated at the banquet to resolve this dispute.

In Xinxiang, I met a colleague who hurriedly told me one sentence: There are many assassinations in Xinxiang. Sure enough, the next day the newspaper published that Wang Xiehe, the deputy chief of the Street Corps of Jixian County, was killed on the way back to Ji from Xin on the 29th.

The prevalence of assassinations has also threatened public opinion circles. The only newspaper printed on local paper in Xinxiang published a letter from a reader at the end of last month, involving the corruption of a town and district chief. The next day, a group of people came to the newspaper office to argue, beat the reporter severely, and threatened them with dangerous words. I saw that a bunker had been built inside the gate of the Da Zhong Newspaper Office, and a guard had been added.

This time, the breach of the Qin River, coupled with several days of heavy rain and flash floods, caused an unprecedented flood in northern Henan. Although the disaster in Xinxiang was not the most serious, the autumn harvest has already been discounted. Wheat has risen to nearly 4 million per dou, and large coal has risen to 100,000 per jin. Whenever I encounter a group of people talking, there will inevitably be a voice: "How can we live?" Autumn is coming soon, and winter is not far away. The people of Xinxiang are now first sharing the news of the emergency repair of the Xin-Jiao section, plus they heard that the government has exempted Henan's military grain. They are looking forward to a warm and well-fed winter!

### Resumption of Flights Between Taiwan and Hong Kong

### Suppression of Black Yi in Western Sichuan - No Expected Results Achieved

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 18th Dispatch] Long-distance telephone from Shaping, Ebian County, Western Sichuan, on the 18th: Min Xiancun, section chief of the Chongqing Pacification Office, who was sent to Ebian to investigate the aftermath of the Heiyi Muganer incident, recently held a meeting in Shaping. More than 20 people attended, including National Representative Ge Chengzhi, County Senate Speaker Jia Shangling, and Councilor Zhang Taojun. During the meeting, they bitterly complained that the suppression of the Muyi had not yielded good results. Although the Muyi had surrendered, they still maintained their full military force. The 50 rifles and 2 machine guns they surrendered to the National Army were all useless. The Heiyi considered the formal guns among the treasures, and not a single one was surrendered. After the complete victory of the National Army's military operations, they still relied on force to retaliate against the Yi people, Gan Ziqing and A Niu, who helped the government during the war. In addition, they presented 140 seals of silver to the National Army, all collected from the Baiyi Wazi under their jurisdiction. Because Wang Lingji ordered that they not be accepted, they are still with the surrendered Yi representative Yasheer, and may have been embezzled by the Muyi to purchase guns and ammunition, which is a disaster for the local area.

### An Old Woman in Qingpu - Died of a Sneeze - Revived for a Day and Died Again

[Our Newspaper, Qingpu, 19th Dispatch] A 76-year-old woman surnamed Ren in Xiwai died suddenly on the morning of the 17th. While her family was holding a funeral, she suddenly revived. She died again suddenly in the evening of the 18th. An hour before her death, she was still talking and laughing as usual. She died with just a sneeze, and her hands and feet became stiff and cold.

### Tragic Scenes of Flooding in Northern Henan - Victims Wade Through Water to Other Villages to Beg for Black Noodle Soup - If Floods Don't Recede, a Spring Famine Next Year Is Inevitable

[Our Newspaper, Xinxiang, 18th Dispatch] This reporter walked dozens of miles on foot through water to Huojia and Xiuwu counties to inspect the flood situation of this unprecedented flood in northern Henan. Starting from west of Huojia City, a vast expanse of water stretches on both sides of the Xin-Jiao Railway. Huojia County is isolated in the water. To the west of Xiuwu County, the water depth on the former Xiu-Bo Highway reaches more than eight feet, making it navigable by boat. When this reporter traveled to Yangchang Village, west of Xiuwu County, the flood victims all knelt before the reporter, pleading with the government to provide relief quickly, with tears streaming down their faces. They mentioned that the greatest pain today is that, in addition to having no food to eat, a small number of illegal troops are forcibly requisitioning military grain. According to them, they are now relying on wading through water to other villages to beg for black noodles to cook soup to fill their stomachs, or picking up vegetables and discarded melon rinds to supplement their diet. This reporter has traveled hundreds of miles back and forth in the disaster area, and the autumn crops seen in the fields have almost all been drowned. There is still no definite decision on closing the breach in the Qin River. If the floods do not recede again, it will affect the planting of wheat, and the spring famine next year will be impossible to survive.

### Stock Bandits Roaming in Yuyao - What Are the Local Authorities Doing About It?

[Our Newspaper, Yuyao, 18th Dispatch] The newly appointed County Magistrate Ying Huaizong comes from the military, but he has not made active preparations for security, resulting in the increasingly rampant and rapidly spreading trend. Recently, the Communist bandits in northern Yao responded to the call of the bandits in Siming Mountain and have become active again. On the evening of the 17th, they kidnapped the eldest son of Sun Xuetai, the chairman of the Rural Farmers' Association in Longnan Township, and Sun Jiemei, the principal of the Hujingdian Village Bao School in Pengjing Township. It is also rumored that Sun has been murdered. In the Yandang Lake Village of Fengting Township in the southern township, more than 20 Communist bandits armed with modern weapons were discovered at about 11:00 p.m. the night before. After staying on a ridge, they fled towards Shengzhuling. The Communist bandits roaming in Mojia Lake forced the Jia chiefs to hold a meeting. The Jia chiefs were forced to attend due to their power. The bandit leader Xia Jilin preached resistance to conscription and grain collection, and the severance of intelligence. Afterwards, they fled to various districts, holding propaganda meetings in return, which made the masses feel more uneasy.

### A Tragic Love Affair and Murder in Yuqian: Meeting a New Paramour and Plotting to Harm the Old Lover; Li Tinggen Poisoned

[Our newspaper's Yuqian dispatch on the 18th] Lan Jinhua, the 31-year-old wife of Zhong Jianwen from Zhulinwu, Thirteenth Bao, Qianyang Town, became romantically involved with Li Tinggen from the same village due to her husband working in the Northeast. They became deeply attached and lived together. Zhu Yugen, a prisoner held at the Yuqian Detention Center, was sentenced to six years for a previous murder case. Last year, his sentence was reduced by three years, and he was soon to be released. He was serving his sentence outside of prison under the guarantee of a certain oil merchant. Zhu was young and handsome and also became passionately involved with Lan Jinhua. The affair between Zhu and Lan intensified to the point where they conspired to poison Li Tinggen's food. Li suffered from severe stomach pain after being poisoned and desperately sought a quick death by running around in confusion and attempting to hang himself from the roof beam. His condition was extremely distressing. Li's wife discovered the plot and immediately reported the incident to the county's judicial office for an autopsy. An examination was conducted by the public hospital, confirming that he had indeed been poisoned and that his life was in danger. The judicial office immediately arrested Lan Jinhua and Zhu Yugen, and they are currently under strict interrogation.

### The Coal Mine in Jiaozuo Paralyzed: Triple Difficulties of Security, Transportation, and Economy; Daily Output of Over a Hundred Tons for Retail Only

[Our newspaper's Xinxiang airmail dispatch on the 18th] Our newspaper's Jiaozuo dispatch: Your correspondent, under the heavy guard and amid the sparse gunfire of the communist bandits along the way, crossed the area where communist bandits roamed between Xiuwu and Jiaozuo and arrived in Jiaozuo, and visited the Wangfeng and Lifeng mining areas separately. Currently, due to security and transportation issues, the mine is in a state of semi-shutdown, with a daily coal output of only a hundred and several tens of tons, only enough for retail sales. A month ago, the highest quality Yuhe coal produced by the mine was selling for only 5.5 million per ton, but now it only sells for 18 million. According to Liu Xiangshan, the director of the mine's general management office, the mine has been struggling to maintain continuous coal production since the Xin-Jiao railway was cut off last July. Currently, the most difficult problems for the mine to solve, besides security, are economic ones. Workers' wages for July and staff salaries for June and July have not been paid. Many workers are supporting themselves by setting up small stalls. Furthermore, the mine is finding it difficult to deal with unreasonable demands from certain quarters. According to investigations, the amount of coal lost each month due to these demands exceeds 4,000 tons. Mr. Liu concluded by saying that the mine's only hope lies in the reopening of the Xin-Jiao railway and the stability of the area around Jiaozuo; otherwise, if this situation continues, the mine will inevitably be forced to shut down after struggling with great difficulty.

### Prelude to the American Election (II): Vandenberg's Anger

— Our newspaper's Special Correspondent in America Mao Shuqing

[Our newspaper's New York airmail dispatch on July 25th] When Truman accepted the Democratic Party's nomination as presidential candidate at the National Convention, he made a rather resounding speech. He said that the biggest difficulty he faced during his term was the obstruction of the Republican Congress. The federal government's insufficient emphasis on educational development, the nationwide "housing shortage" that has not been completely resolved, and the inability to curb rising prices and inflation were all due to the Republican-controlled Congress obstructing him at every turn. He said that he had always opposed the Taft-Hartley Labor Act because it harmed the rights of workers, but the Republican Congress insisted on passing it. He said that he would continue to fight for the Democratic Party's established platform and policies.

Truman's words were consistent with Barkley's speech. Barkley, the 70-year-old senior senator from Kentucky, gave one of the most brilliant performances at the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia in mid-July. Barkley's long speech was eloquent and vented a lot of frustration for the Democratic Party itself. He denounced the Republican Party's "malicious attacks" on the Democratic Party in its propaganda, and he defended President Roosevelt's "New Deal." He spoke of the tragic situation in America during the Hoover era in 1932, saying, "Fortunately, President Roosevelt's brilliant new economic policy saved the overall situation in America." He said: "Today, Republicans are defying their conscience and creating propaganda everywhere, scolding us as New Dealers, making Americans think that New Dealers are monsters. We Democrats and patriotic citizens of America should not be misled by such malicious attacks. We are New Dealers because America has the Roosevelt's New Deal, that's why we have today's situation"!

Barkley defended the Truman administration by comparing today with 1932. That day, Truman sent a telegram from the White House congratulating him on the success of his speech. At that time, the question of the vice-presidency was still undecided. Truman originally wanted to invite Justice Douglas of the Supreme Court to run. Douglas was originally widely supported "to run for president to replace the mediocre Truman." Douglas lived on the West Coast and declined all support. Senator McConaughey was rumored to be the earliest candidate for vice president, but he was from the "Midwest," like Truman. Truman himself wanted to find a vice president from the East or from either coast to be his running mate, which was originally based on the idea of democratic convention.

However, after Barkley's speech, he suddenly won the infinite support of the masses, and the vice-presidential nomination fell on Barkley without contention. For the Democratic Party itself, Barkley's candidacy as Truman's "running mate" had more disadvantages than advantages. The reasons were: (1) Barkley was from Kentucky, in the middle of the country, and had no connection to the East or West Coast. From a geographical point of view, the East and West Coasts have denser populations and more voters, and the Democratic Party would therefore lose votes. (2) Barkley was 70 years old this year, which was excessively old to be a vice-presidential candidate. Although Barkley's vigor was comparable to that of Léon Blum of France, Blum's attempt to "form a cabinet" still failed in the French parliament the year before. Before Barkley decided to accept the nomination, several Democratic Party "bosses" (generally called bosses in the United States), such as Hague of New Jersey and Avey of Chicago, advised Barkley to "think twice." Their opinion was that at 70 years old, he should no longer block the "path of virtue" and give the opportunity to younger successors. But the result was still ineffective.

Generally speaking, if the Democratic Party is bound to fail in the November election, then whether the "running mate" is young or old will not make much difference. According to Truman himself, he is very confident of "victory" in the November election because he believes that his inability to make sweeping changes in domestic affairs is not the fault of his executive branch, but rather the failure of the Republican 80th Congress to smoothly pass his proposals. He is confident that the American people should understand his plight and hate the Republican Party. Therefore, after returning to the White House from Philadelphia, his first action was to order a special session of both houses of Congress to discuss emergency domestic programs.

The White House press office told reporters: The day the Democratic Convention ended, the President rushed back to Washington from Philadelphia, arriving at 12:30 at night. At 5:00 in the morning, the President was already seen sitting in his office in the White House. Many people suspected that the President had not slept all night, and that he was now beginning to "face the enemy" and fight against the strong Republican lineup.

According to American practice, both houses of Congress take a vacation every summer, just like the Legislative Yuan in China now. The American Constitution stipulates that the President has the power to convene a special session during the congressional recess to urgently discuss important national policies if necessary. According to a report by Knowles, the New York Times' correspondent in the capital: "A sitting president who is running for the next presidential term suddenly convening a special session during the congressional recess is unprecedented in American history. But President Truman actually did it!"

The Republican Party strongly opposed the President's order to convene a special session of Congress. Republicans in Washington called Truman's move a "petty trick" and a "small conspiracy," and some called Truman's move a "low-level political game." The person who was particularly outraged was Vandenberg, who was in Michigan. Vandenberg told reporters for the Associated Press that "Truman's call is the last gasp of a dying regime." He said: "I don't believe there is any earth-shattering emergency that requires convening such a special session to discuss!"

A senior politician like Vandenberg, who has prestige and weight, never complains or swears at people. This time, his indignation at Truman's "petty tricks" is probably the first time I have seen him angry. But he still had to go to Washington to attend, and they would never shirk their responsibilities.

The special session of Congress is to open tomorrow, only eleven days after Truman issued the call. In his speech accepting the nomination at the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia on July 14, Truman lashed out at the Republican-controlled Congress. He also said: Today, since all the comrades of the Democratic Party still nominated him to run for the next presidential term, he must implement the party's agenda, and he must realize these propositions and complete the legislative procedures within fifteen days.

Applying the party's decisions to politics, Truman returned to Washington in the middle of the night on July 14 and ordered a special session of Congress early on the 15th. Barkley, who was still in Philadelphia at the time, was overjoyed when he heard the call. He gave a thumbs-up: "Good brave president, did the right thing!"

Of course, Truman will raise his voice in the special session and put on his most brilliant performance. Increase education funding, allocate funds to build houses, relieve European refugees, open immigration restrictions, curb inflation, strictly control prices – all the things that the American people are asking the government for today will all be spread from Truman's mouth to Congress. If Congress refuses to pass them, that is Congress's responsibility. Who is the majority party in Congress? Who controls Congress? The American people all know it is the Republican Party! Truman's move is certainly very "spicy," but also very powerful!

How will the Republican Party respond? Of course, it will take considerable thought. The day Truman issued the call, Taft met with Dewey, and they certainly had a secret discussion. Outside reports said that Republican senators would immediately propose "adjournment" after listening to Truman's speech, giving Truman a cold shoulder. Giving a cold shoulder to Truman's bill is of no consequence, but every tax-paying citizen in America has to share a huge travel expense of 222,000 US dollars. According to a report in the New York Daily News! The travel expenses include the Senate and the House of Representatives. The travel expenses for the 96 senators amount to 51,000 yuan. The travel expenses for the 435 representatives amount to 171,000 yuan.

More than 220,000 dollars is truly insignificant in the US Treasury's expenditure. The problem is that this "special session" may make the election competition between the Democratic and Republican parties more acute. Add to that Wallace's third party and the South's fourth party, making the picture of the American election in November more vivid and tense!

### After the Implementation of the New Currency System, Banks and Financial Institutions Should First Rectify Themselves

[Our Dispatch] After the news of the currency system reform reached the city the night before, most banks and financial institutions spent the night sorting out their accounts. Yesterday morning, Chen Duoru, the representative of the banking industry in the city, and Shen Rixin, the representative of the Money Industry Association, visited Bi Delin, the deputy director of the Financial Control Bureau, to consult on certain matters. According to Mr. Shen Rixin, the new measures include a six-month period to eliminate banks and financial institutions with insufficient capital. In addition to banks and financial institutions rectifying themselves first, it is hoped that the government can be more cautious in setting the required capital amount. According to general observations, after the opportunities for speculation are reduced with the issuance of the new currency, banks and financial institutions with unsound contents will inevitably be naturally eliminated. It is reported that the Financial Control Bureau dispatched 15 inspection teams yesterday to supervise various banks and financial institutions, prohibiting any deposit or lending activities.

Further News: Lin Chongyong, the Director of the Financial Control Bureau, took the night train to Nanjing the day before to attend the talks held by the Executive Yuan yesterday (20th), and took the opportunity to request instructions from the Ministry on the control measures during the transition period, and will return to Shanghai soon.

### Gasoline, Diesel, and Fuel Oil Prices: The Import and Export Control Committee Re-approves Adjustments; The Second Adjustment This Month, Up 40 Percent

The various oil companies in this city have been selling at the new prices since yesterday. It is heard that all these oils will be sold at Gold Yuan prices starting next week.

### New Tobacco Leaves Have Arrived on the Market; Tobacco Merchants Are Buying

Recently, with new tobacco leaves arriving on the market from various places, the tobacco leaf companies in this city, in order to supply the raw materials needed by the various cigarette factories in this city and for the sake of their own business development, have sent people to various production areas to purchase high-quality tobacco leaves such as smoked tobacco and native tobacco. Their routes have spread almost all over the country. Xuchang, Henan, which used to be the leader in the domestic tobacco leaf market, has suffered repeated wars, and its output and reputation are not as good as before. Currently, what can be shipped to Shanghai is still goods from Hankou and other places in the past. However, the tobacco leaves in the Kunming area of Yunnan, due to proper cultivation, produce high-quality tobacco leaves, which are now superior to Xuchang leaves, and their prices are also the most expensive. In addition to the tobacco leaves from Kunming and Xuchang, the next best are those produced in Qingzhou and Fengge. The next purchasing target is mostly concentrated on the Bengbu and Fengyang leaves. As of now, more than 20 merchants have successively dispatched purchasing agents to purchase new tobacco leaves. However, due to purchase negotiations and transportation relations, it is expected that the new tobacco leaves will arrive in Shanghai in about two months.

### Sharp Increase in Remittances from Northeast China

### Implementing Emergency Economic Measures - Great Benefits for Export Businesses - Government to Implement Export Price Limits

To cooperate with the government's currency reform, the Export Control Committee convened a discussion meeting yesterday afternoon with leaders from various export industries in the city. The meeting was presided over by Chen, the director of the Export Promotion Department of the committee, with representatives from the Central Bank and other institutions also in attendance. The meeting's content focused on discussing concrete steps to coordinate with the government's efforts to streamline finances and tighten economic controls.

Reportedly, the government's current currency reform is of great benefit to the export industry, and China's various export goods will be able to be exported in large quantities. However, to avoid exporters competing with each other and engaging in dumping, the government has decided to implement export price limits to stabilize overseas markets, earn foreign exchange, and maintain the interests of exporters. The export price limit will be based on the overseas market conditions of the 19th of this month as the price standard. For example, Tianjin No. 55 long bristles will be priced at US$9.60 per pound CIF, tung oil at US$0.20 per pound CIF, and soybeans at 37 British shillings per ton FOB Shanghai, etc. During the meeting, exporters requested that the authorities settle foreign exchange at a rate of 4 new yuan to 1 US dollar, deducting the original foreign exchange benchmark price (474,000 old legal tender yuan). They also requested a reduction in export loan interest rates, calculated according to pre-war interest rates. The authorities have reportedly already made decisions on these matters and will announce them soon.

### Export Control Committee Announces Last Week's Export Situation

Domestic and Foreign Market Prices Continue to Rise

The Export Control Committee announced yesterday the export and foreign exchange settlement situation for the week of August 8th to 14th: From the 8th to the 14th, domestic market prices for exported goods continued to rise, increasing by an average of 27% compared to the previous week. Foreign market prices were generally stable, with only Tianjin No. 26 and Hankou No. 17 pig bristles and feathers showing slight increases, while soybeans and tung oil fell. The exchange certificate price market remained strong, reaching 7.7 million at the end of the week, with a weekly average of approximately 6,655,000 yuan, an increase of 17% compared to the previous week. Based on the domestic and foreign market prices at the beginning of the week and the exchange certificate rate at that time, exports of Shanghai and Hankou pig bristles, feathers, casings, and egg products could generate profits, with raw cowhide being particularly profitable. However, Tianjin products, edible oil, gauze, Chinese medicine, and gallnuts incurred losses due to excessive domestic price increases. The current export market conditions for major export products this week are briefly described below:

Tung Oil: Foreign market prices were stable, with New York C.I.F. fluctuating between US$0.195 and US$0.20 per pound, and Shanghai F.O.B. only US$0.1725 per pound. At the beginning of the week, export losses were approximately 20%. However, because market prices in the mainland and South China were much lower than in Shanghai, many local tung oil exporters purchased from these areas, reportedly transporting up to 4,000 dan per day to Shanghai. Exports through Hong Kong also increased in July.

Pig Bristles: Foreign market prices were slightly better, with short bristles of Hankou No. 17 and Tianjin No. 26 both rising. On Monday, the C.I.F. New York prices were US$4.40 and US$6.60 per pound, respectively. There were no other changes. Exports of Hankou bristles were more profitable, at approximately 25%, while Shanghai bristles barely covered costs, and the rest incurred losses. Exports through Hong Kong remained active in July, with some being bartered to Japan.

Tea: Arrivals were few, and market prices were strong. Precious eyebrow, needle eyebrow, and special grade goods were in high demand overseas, but offers were stingy, and the market remained stagnant. It was recently heard that large merchants were purchasing Taiwan tea for transport, and prices also rose sharply, reducing shipments to Hong Kong.

Raw Silk: Foreign market conditions were calm, with D-grade goods priced at US$3 per pound C.I.F. New York, and Shanghai F.O.B. at US$2.80. Exports incurred slight losses. However, due to the favorable exchange certificate rate, export activity has begun, with the market still in the United States, but the volume of transactions is minimal.

Pig Casings: At the beginning of the week, the domestic price for 13.5-yard casings increased by 20% compared to the previous week. Foreign prices were stable, with Shanghai F.O.B. prices at US$0.1875. Due to the increase in the exchange certificate price, export profits still reached 22%.

Feathers: Domestic and foreign prices both rose. Duck and goose feathers Shanghai F.O.B. rose to US$0.375 and US$0.535 per pound, respectively, with export profits of approximately 10%.

Gauze and Textiles: Although domestic prices rose sharply, foreign prices remained stable. Demand from Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia, was very strong. However, with the rising price of raw cotton and the difficulty in supply, domestic factories were facing a severe threat, and exports were unlikely to be optimistic.

Mineral Ores: Export conditions have become more active, mainly due to the increased U.S. demand for tin and antimony. Government and private businesses are both shipping to Hong Kong. Merchants from Southeast Asia and India are going to Hong Kong to purchase goods. Factories that relocated to Hong Kong also have demand, so sales in Hong Kong have become smoother.

There are three "Yucai Middle Schools" in Shanghai. One is "Yucai School," founded by Tao Xingzhi, located in Dachang. The second is "Private Yucai Middle School," located on Shanzhong Road in the city. Our school was founded by the former Municipal Council and was originally named "Yucai Public School." After the war, it was transferred to the city and is now called "Shanghai Municipal Yucai Middle School," located at the intersection of Shanhai Pass Road and Carter Road. The students of our school have pure ideologies and are dedicated to their studies. They have never been involved in external affairs. The graduates of this summer were all busy applying to famous universities in Beijing and Shanghai in order to pursue further studies. In order to avoid any misunderstanding of our school by the outside world, in addition to investigating the truth of the matter with the relevant authorities, we hereby issue this statement to clarify the facts.

### Li Shouyong and Others Establish the "Forward Middle School"

[Reported by our newspaper] The number of secondary schools in the Hongkou District has been decimated by the ravages of war. Although they have gradually recovered in recent years, they have not yet reached one-third of their pre-war level. Recently, Li Shouyong, Wu Shaoshu, Jiang Jianbai, Ge Kexin, Gu Zhuqi, Zhu Hua, Wang Lanseng, Lu Ticheng, Zou Wenhai, Ma Shuli, Xing Songwen, Cao Juren, and other figures from the educational and cultural circles of this city, in response to social needs, gathered to discuss the establishment of the "Forward Middle School" in Shenjiawan. The school is a complete secondary school, divided into senior and junior high school departments, and also has a vocational supplementary class. It is located in the central area of Hongkou, making it very convenient for young students. Yesterday, the board of directors elected Li Shouyong as chairman, Ma Shuli as managing director, and Cao Juren as principal. They are accelerating preparations for the opening of the school. It is reported that registration will begin immediately and an entrance exam will be held on the 28th of this month.

### Thrilling Victory by the World Games Basketball Team - A One-Point Win Over Korea

— Special correspondent for this newspaper, Zhong Zhen

[Reported by our newspaper from London by airmail] After yesterday's heavy rain, the weather in London has become very cool, like late autumn. According to people who have lived in the UK for a long time, this is the standard British weather.

After defeating the Belgian team yesterday (August 2nd), our national basketball team played its first round-robin match against the Korean team at the Harringay Arena at 9:00 PM tonight. The Korean team's coordination was quick and skillful, and their shooting was accurate. In terms of skill, they were better than the Chinese team. Therefore, from the beginning of the game to the last second, the Korean team was always in the lead. Finally, our army was blessed. In the last second, the left forward Shi Qiao made an incredible shot from ten yards away with a backward single-handed throw. The ball had just left his hand when time ran out, and the Chinese team was declared victorious. Such a thrilling game was unprecedented in this World Games basketball tournament. Our national basketball team has won twice, and foreigners are looking at us with new respect. This can be considered a triumph for our country's delegation to the World Games and a victory for the people of the country. The progress of the game is recorded below:

Wu Cheng Zhang Li Shi Qiao

Cai Wenhua

Li Zhenzhong Huang Tianxi Zhi Jun Bao Songyuan

Korean Team Led All the Way

After the tip-off, the Korean team was very aggressive and scored two consecutive goals with quick passes. Cai Wenhua of our army committed a foul and was penalized with another goal. The Korean team took a 5-0 lead in three minutes. Our army quickly counterattacked. Li Shiqiao shot from afar and brushed the net, and Huang Tianxi jumped up and rebounded, pulling back two goals. The Korean team responded with several well-executed shots, and our army was still behind 6-14, a difference of eight points. After this, the Chinese players were slightly flustered, and the formation became looser. Free throws were repeatedly missed. In addition, Cai Wenhua had a slight pain when he entered the court, so his normally reliable long-range shots failed. Despite the best efforts of Li Shiqiao and Wu Chengzhang, it was to no avail. At the end of the first half, the Korean team was far ahead with a score of 28-16. During the break, the Chinese spectators and players were very frustrated. But in all fairness, there was no reason to complain about the Chinese team's defeat. The Korean team members were not only physically fit and well-rounded, but also extremely well-coordinated. In addition, their shooting was accurate, so it was impossible for our army to win.

Li Zhenzhong, the Veteran in the Whole Field

After the change of ends in the second half, our army's attack was still weak. Coach Song Junfu immediately sent the veteran Li Zhenzhong onto the field to replace Huang Tianxi, and the situation improved. Li Zhenzhong's long-range shot was successful, and his command was appropriate. He was worthy of being a basketball veteran. Right forward Wu Chengtong also scored two consecutive goals with a quick movement, and the situation gradually improved. But in the end, due to the disparity in strength, there was no certainty of victory. Until the last quarter, the score was 39-41, only one goal behind. At this time, the Chinese and foreign spectators on both sides of the stands shouted "China Team Go!". But in an instant, the fleeting opportunity disappeared, and the Korean team took the lead again with a score of 47-41. At this time, the veteran Li Zhenzhong came on the field again, worked hard to command, and launched a counterattack. In the last three minutes, Li Shiqiao and Wu Chengzhang made successive contributions, and the score soared. The score was 47-48, only one point behind.

Li Shiqiao Brought a Comeback

The end of the game was imminent. At this critical moment, left forward Li Shiqiao suddenly jumped up and made a single-handed shot from ten yards away, and it was successful! Just as the ball left his hand, the recorder's second hand pointed to twelve o'clock, and the bell rang, signaling the end of the game. The Chinese team was declared the winner with a score of 49-48 over the Korean team. At this time, the audience burst into thunderous applause and cheers, and the enthusiastic scene of the spectators and players was beyond words. Li Shiqiao, a member of the Chinese basketball team, was greatly appreciated by foreigners for this incredible shot, and was hailed as a "Chinese Prodigy" because he was young and small. But the contributions of right forward Wu Chengzhang and center Cai Wenhua should not be ignored. Tomorrow afternoon at 7:00 PM, they will face the formidable opponent, the Philippines. The Philippines is very strong, but they were defeated by Chile 68-39 this afternoon. It seems that there is hope for tomorrow's game. If we can win three games against other countries, our country can enter the finals, which would be an unprecedented achievement for our World Games team.

### World Games Basketball Team Suffers Defeat in Bangkok - Loses to Overseas Chinese Team 35-41

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 19th] The overconfident Chinese World Games basketball team lost to the Overseas Chinese team here today by a score of 41 to 35. Today happened to be the Ghost Festival on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month, and the audience was unprecedentedly crowded. The World Games team led 11 to 8 in the first quarter, but by the end of the second quarter, the Overseas Chinese team had taken the lead 18 to 17. Most of the audience felt that the World Games team was too polite and that the home team played exceptionally well. In the third quarter, Bao Songyuan entered the game, and the Overseas Chinese team scored 13 points while the visiting team only scored 6 points. Surprised, the World Games team substituted Cai Zhongqiang in the fourth quarter, who cooperated with Bao Songyuan. The score once came close to 35 to 33, but the home team still maintained the lead and ultimately defeated the World Games team 41 to 35, thanks to their good fortune. The World Games team arrived here yesterday afternoon, and the journey was tiring. The absence of Li Shiqiao and Huang Tianxi was also a major reason for the defeat.

### Summer Vacation Tutors Awaiting Employment

### Telecommunications Q&A

Answered by Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau

(Tang Wendong, of Shuimin Road, asks) Our household received a telephone bill, and the number of calls did not match the actual number and was much higher. Averaging five calls per day, the total for the month should not exceed two hundred. However, our household has never exceeded five calls per day. Please investigate and reply.

(Answer) The Bureau's call counting is based on automatic machine records, which rarely have errors. After inspecting the machine lines, there were no obstacles. It is presumed that your records are inaccurate, as it is unreasonable for there to be overcounting.

(Li Guangbin, of Renji Road, asks) What is the procedure for canceling a long-distance call? Under what circumstances can a "free cancellation" be made?

(Answer) After registering for a long-distance call, you can apply for cancellation yourself. A "free cancellation" can be made if one of the following four situations occurs: (1) A line or machine suddenly malfunctions, preventing connection to the called party's exchange; (2) The called party has been reached, but the line suddenly breaks down; (3) The line is congested after registration; (4) The called party has already called first.

### Zhu Ziqing's Prose

— Ji Yong

Because of Zhu's death, I can't help but reread Zhu's prose. I feel that Zhu's writing style differs significantly between his early and later years. This is probably not unique to Zhu, nor is it unique to the literary field. Any writer's early works and works after becoming famous often have significant differences. In terms of thought, they can even be completely different.

Early prose writers generally had a long history of writing classical Chinese prose, just like early new poetry writers were all classical poets. Therefore, the prose of that time always seemed unable to escape the influence of classical Chinese, unable to reach the point of "using the pen like a tongue" (Zhu's advocacy in his article "Speaking"). The most obvious example is "The Qinhuai River in Paddle Sounds and Lantern Shadows," which Zhu and Yu jointly wrote in 1923. It not only contains remnants of old-style prose but also floats with the lingering charm of old poetry. Please see the following sentences; are they common in today's prose?

"... But the lamplight ultimately could not overshadow the moonlight over there. The lamplight was muddy, and the moonlight was clear. It was truly a miracle for a stream of clear brilliance to seep into the turbid lamplight! The moon was already two or three parts thinner that night; she had just finished her evening makeup and gracefully ascended the willow tips. The sky was a lovely blue, as if it were a pool of water, making the moon even more energetic... But the lamplight and moonlight could coexist and blend together, making the moon a lingering moon, and the lamplight shooting out faint spiritual brilliance. This is precisely Heaven's favor to the Qinhuai River, and it is precisely Heaven's favor to us."

These kinds of sentences have even more twists and turns than Yongzhou's Eight Records and are quite like Song Dynasty slow-paced lyrics. If compared with Zhu's most popular "Back View" essay, they are clearly two different types. To be honest, Zhu did not like or approach this type, so we feel that he did not write this essay ideally. For example, his later travel notes about Europe are not in this tone. Originally, there were two paths at the beginning of the new prose era. If we take Zhu's works as an example, one is the "Back View" type, and the other is the "Qinhuai Moon" type. There are many who belong to the "Back View" type, and those who belong to the latter, in addition to Yu Pingbo, also include Fei Ming and He Qifang. They are somewhat obscure, making it difficult for people to understand.

Yu Pingbo has written very little prose recently, so it's difficult to definitively say how his style has changed. In any case, he was deeply influenced by old poetry in his early years, as seen in the Qinhuai essay he wrote with Zhu. As for Zhu, it can be said that he went from extreme magnificence to plainness, or that he became closer and closer to his true nature. In short, his recent works can be said to have achieved the form of moving from broad to concise, from artificial to purely natural. Zhu said in his article "Speaking":

"Speaking is not necessarily more difficult than writing, but it is definitely not easier. Some people can speak but cannot write, but some people can write but cannot speak. Speaking is like flowing clouds and flowing water, and it is impossible to scrutinize it word by word. Therefore, there are inevitably omissions and looseness, which is not as rigorous as writing. However, the naturalness of flowing clouds and flowing water cannot be reached by ordinary articles—if an article can reach this state, it should simply be regarded as speaking and no longer as writing. But what a difficult state this is to reach!..."

These words are not only his creative theory but can also be said to be an indicator of his recent writing. The realm of flowing clouds and flowing water is indeed not easy to reach, but Zhu's freshness and fluency can indeed reach this realm. I very much agree with two paragraphs in his "Flying":

"Indeed, you can watch the sunrise and sunset in the ocean, but you have to be lucky. The sunrise and sunset are meaningful only with the setting off of clouds and rosy clouds; otherwise, a dull sun is simply a fool! Although clouds and rosy clouds are often present, they are often faint and lazy, which is still meaningless. They must be rich and change, with a new pattern emerging in the blink of an eye to be worth watching. This is something that can be encountered but not sought... The sky is like the sea, also large and monotonous. There seems to be no shortage of literature and art about the sun, moon, stars, and clouds, but they are all looking up from below. There is not much said about the entire sky. There is a little bit about the starry sky and the night sky, but apart from words like 'blue sky,' 'bright blue sky,' or 'gloomy sky,' there seems to be nothing else to say about the sky. However, even if a person sitting on an airplane for the first time has little background in literature or art to help his imagination, he still has the imagination of 'letting the birds fly in the sky.' Coupled with the experience of others, looking down from above, it seems that it is not just vast but also has the churning sea of clouds and the flat brocade. This is enough to ponder."

If you use this kind of realm to describe Zhu's work, do you think it is a dull, melon-like sun? No, no, it is not so fanatical and dazzling. Do you think he is a blue sky? No, no, it is not as stagnant and silent. He is precisely the sea of clouds seen on an airplane, the early sun with a new pattern emerging in the blink of an eye. Those who do not understand only feel that it is very ordinary, but those who have some literary cultivation feel that the "churning sea of clouds" and "flat brocade" provide us with endless images. (Compare the writing style with the one quoted earlier, is it the same?)

Zhu passed away at the young age of fifty, and his future achievements would have been far more than this. I hope that young people will continue the legacy of their predecessors in prose and not, like a certain newspaper in Nanjing, produce an incomprehensible classical Chinese eulogy to mourn him. If all his "students" are like this, Zhu will not rest in peace even in death!

### Talking about Cheating on Exams

— Jiang Zongyu

Under the examination system of imperial examinations, getting into university is indeed not an easy task. Coupled with the collapse of the social economy in the past ten years, the threshold of national universities has become even more daunting in order to reduce the burden on families. We often see that young people themselves, or even their fathers and brothers, often rack their brains to think of various ways to enable themselves or their children to "succeed in the imperial examination." The most common method is, of course, the practice of "seeking help," so before and after the annual entrance examination, principals, deans, and professors can receive piles of "introductions" that are full of pitiful situations such as "My child, suffering from ×××, is determined to pursue further education but cannot find the door." However, precisely because there are so many introducers, it is really not easy to be accepted. As a result, one can only be shelved aside with "help as much as possible within the possible range." Therefore, although the practice of seeking help is prevalent, I am afraid that it is of little effect. Since this easiest and most dignified method has become ineffective, with the progress of the times, the tricks that have followed have become increasingly innovative. Things like smuggling notes, peeking at others, and flipping through books are outdated and unreliable, and the risk is too great. Although these tricks can still be seen in the examination hall, they are all "pitiable" "latecomers" who are disdained by the "advanced" "inventors."

The first so-called new method is "improved proxy examination." The key to this technique is whether one can get through when checking the photo on the registration form and certificate during registration. As long as the appearance of the hired proxy examiner does not have obvious differences, or after passing through photographic technology, the staff is often too tired of that kind of mechanical work in the crowded and messy situation of registration, they will often overlook it. If this barrier is passed, you can take the exam without any worries. However, after admission, many schools require verifying handwriting, but most of them are just a formality. Even if there are some minor problems, they can be explained away with reasons such as different moods during the exam, different pens, etc. The author is a student who has not been in university for long, and I have seen this kind of thing happen many times.

The second type is exchanging exam papers. This is one of the so-called "escort examination" methods. Two people apply for the same department, and the seats during the exam, even if there is a gap, are not very far apart. When the exam papers are distributed, they have been waiting at the first stack at the entrance of the examination hall. When the bell rings for the first time, the two quickly run to each other's seats. When everyone walks into the examination hall like a tide, they can take the exchanged exam papers to their original positions in the chaos. This situation often occurs in large examination halls with hundreds of people or more.

In addition, there is also the most advanced "escort," in which two, three, or even five or six "masters" are hired in advance to register at the same time for a large-scale "escort examination." Although the seat numbers during the exam cannot be completely together, as long as one of them is on the left or right, the goal has been achieved. In the current examination halls with limited space and a large number of people, there is almost no distance between seats, so exchanging exam papers, glancing at each other and copying, are all as desired. It can be said that it is the culmination of various cheating methods.

Cheating on exams has probably been around since ancient times, and it is even worse today! The author's knowledge is limited, and I have inevitably failed to collect everything, but this is enough to surprise people. These are all products of the times and the system. Gentlemen in charge of education, if you think that the examination system still has value, then this phenomenon should be noted. Otherwise, it should be fundamentally considered.

### American Tidbits

— Xian Si

The United States has sold 98% of its surplus materials overseas. These materials originally had a value of $10,547,845,500. The U.S. government sold them at 20% of their value, receiving $1,962,800,400. Before planting seedlings, American farms now pass the seedlings through ultrasonic waves with extremely high vibration rates, which are said to accelerate the growth of the trees. Potatoes that have passed through ultrasonic waves mature earlier than ordinary potatoes, and these potatoes are particularly large.

The United States also implements daylight saving time, which is scheduled to end on September 26 this year. However, California and Nevada are preparing to extend it until January next year to save electricity.

The crime rate among American veterans has surged. More than a quarter of the criminals in federal prisons are veterans who participated in World War II, and the proportion of these veterans in state prisons is more than half.

The United States has been feeling a leather panic in recent years and recently airlifted 30,000 snake skins from Siam and India for the manufacture of women's shoes, handbags, belts... and other items.

### Mustache Cover

— An Ru

When I was a child, reading Romance of the Three Kingdoms, there was a passage that I can still remember today, which is Guan Yu's mustache cover.

According to the novel, Emperor Xian of Han saw Guan Gong's extraordinarily long and beautiful beard and became very interested, asking questions. Guan Gong said that he often hung a long bag on his chest every night when he slept, putting his beard inside for protection.

I often wondered at the time what this kind of beard bag looked like - if it was too wide, it would not be able to protect the beard, and if it was too small, it would not be convenient to put the beard in. However, I always felt that the matter itself was very interesting.

Unexpectedly, forty-five years ago (1904), an American probably heard someone talk about Romance of the Three Kingdoms and plagiarized Guan Gong's old article, actually claiming it as his own, saying that he had newly invented a "mustache cover" and specially registered it with the U.S. agency specializing in registering new inventions and handling patents (Patent Office) - unfortunately, no one has appreciated it to this day, and his invention has finally failed.

### A Discussion of Meditation Experiences (4)

— Jiang Wenyu

A Scientific Explanation of Meditation

Meditation was originally the so-called "inner work" of ancient Chinese Taoism. Can it be explained using modern scientific terms? I say it can. Of course, my scientific knowledge is extremely shallow, and I may not be able to truly explain the reasoning, but it doesn't hurt to say a few words in a simple way.

The human body originally has two types of nervous systems, one is the animal nervous system, and the other is the autonomic nervous system. The animal nervous system controls human perception and movement, while the autonomic nervous system is distributed in the internal organs and blood vessels and is connected to the animal system, so it is also called the sympathetic nervous system. The nerve center of the animal system is the brain. If the brain is overused, it will definitely feel tired. If you want to relieve the fatigue, you must rest. In the eyes of ordinary people, the way to rest is, of course, to sleep. If you don't use sleep, there is another special method that can allow the brain nerve center and all the organs to get rest, and it is true rest (because there are still dreams when you sleep, so it can't be considered true rest). If this kind of rest can be had once a day, for fifty minutes to an hour each time, thinking about it, it will definitely greatly help restore and improve human health. This can be determined by common sense. The meditation method eliminates thoughts, making all thoughts empty, temporarily making all nerves not have a single thought inside, and cutting off contact with things outside. Isn't this the best way to rest? However, simply resting and temporarily stopping nerve function is still passive. For example, if the political function of a country is to temporarily stop diplomatic work, it is possible, but it cannot fail to repair internal affairs. And if internal affairs are truly repaired well, then it will definitely be particularly smooth and beneficial in the future when dealing with diplomacy. The so-called repairing internal affairs is the abdominal movement of deep and fine breathing.

Originally, the nerves of the abdominal viscera belong to the autonomic nervous system. It usually has very little direct contact with the outside world, but it has a close relationship with the brain nerves and is distributed in various blood vessels. Let's use the national political institutions as an analogy: its role in the human body is like the country's transportation and transportation, and of course, the relationship with all domestic politics is extremely important. To repair internal affairs, there is no doubt that the entire transportation and transportation system should be sorted out to be very sound and very flexible. In the human body, there is a so-called visceral arterial plexus (Plexus coeliacuss colore) in the abdomen and a so-called hypogastric plexus (Plekus bypoqostvicus) in the pelvic region. The distribution of its sympathetic nerves is the most and the densest, and it can be said to be the most important transportation and transportation hub in the human body. However, people usually spend very little effort on sorting out and exercising it. That is no different from the country repairing internal affairs, failing to pay much attention to the transportation and transportation agencies, which is certainly not right. We practice gymnastics and engage in various fitness exercises, which is naturally very important, but what it exercises is still the external skin, muscles, and bones, with very little direct impact on the internal organs. It can be seen that this kind of effort to repair internal affairs seems to be not enough. If there is another special method that can constantly stimulate and exercise the sympathetic nerves, so that their function is enhanced and their vitality is strengthened, and naturally can promote the entire metabolism and increase the overall life force, then using deep and fine breathing to carry out abdominal visceral movement is to complete this function. It can be said that the effort of practicing gymnastics and engaging in various sports is "external smelting," so it can be called "external work," while this kind of abdominal visceral movement is "internal development," so China has called it "internal work" since ancient times. Naturally, external work is also extremely important and extremely valuable. It not only has the function of fitness but also has the effects of moral education, group education, and aesthetic education included incidentally. However, "external work" is already well known to the general public, while "internal work" is a very ancient method, and is often not valued or believed by people. That is why, after my own experience, I still do not mind using more words and forgetting my shallow knowledge to specially prove it with crude scientific terms. Of course, there are many incomplete places in what I have said, and there may even be some wrong places. I sincerely hope that scientific experts will teach me.
