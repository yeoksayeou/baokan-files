### Chairman Discusses with Zhang Zuoxiang and Others, Decides to Dispatch Large Troops to Pass Through the Border to Reinforce the Northeast; People from Northeast Living in Beijing Appeal for Saving Their Hometowns

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] Chairman Jiang on the 29th formally expressed to the Northeast envoys that the central government will absolutely and consistently implement the policy of never abandoning the Northeast. This statement has deeply impressed and moved those who came to pay their respects, and strengthened their confidence. Chairman Jiang summoned Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, Ma Zhanshan, and Zou Zuohua at 12:30 AM on the 29th, accompanied by Mo Dehui and Liu Zhe. The Chairman hosted a luncheon, with Chen BuLei from the Presidential Office, Bai Chongxi, Minister of National Defense, Chen Fangzhong, Director of the Political Affairs Bureau, and Tao Xisheng, Deputy Minister of Propaganda, as guests. During the meal, Zhang, Wan, Ma, and Zou respectively explained the current situation in the Northeast, especially the current crisis and the urgent problems to be solved, involving both domestic and foreign affairs. They believe that the Northeast is currently facing unprecedented difficulties, but it is not impossible to save it. There are two reasons for this: First, the brutal crimes of the Communist bandits in various parts of the Northeast are even worse than the vicious methods used during the Japanese rule; second, the Communist bandits do not yet have a deep foundation in the Northeast, and currently only rely on terrorist policies to maintain their temporary control, while the people of the Northeast are irreconcilable with the Communist bandits. With these two reasons, the difficulties in the Northeast can still be resolved. They suggested two things: (1) Expedite the dispatch of large troops to reinforce the Northeast, secure existing strongholds, and actively open up transportation lines; (2) Effectively use the manpower and material resources of the Northeast to assist the national army in combat, while organizing the masses to strengthen local armed forces and penetrate deep behind enemy lines. After Zhang and others finished their report, the Chairman immediately stated that the government has long been determined to defend the Northeast, and this is a consistent policy of the central government that will never be changed. The existing military strongholds will be firmly defended by the national army, which is not a problem, and transportation lines will be actively opened up in the future. As for using local manpower and material resources to strengthen local armed forces and penetrate deep behind enemy lines, the Chairman expressed great appreciation. After Zhang, Wan, Ma, and Zou left, they were extremely optimistic about the Chairman's decisive command and well-organized deployment, and they all believed that with the Chairman's determination, the Northeast would definitely have a solution.

[Another Dispatch] Compatriots from the nine provinces and three cities of the Northeast living in Beijing issued a declaration on the 29th regarding the Northeast crisis. The following is a brief record: We, the compatriots, in order to rescue our hometown, to defend our motherland, and to fulfill our human duty, hereby put forward the following urgent appeals: (1) Demand that the government immediately dispatch large troops to ensure the existing strongholds in the Northeast, open up important transportation lines, and reverse the entire war situation; (2) Demand that the government airlift a large amount of food to supply the Northeast military and civilians; (3) Demand that the government reform the Northeast currency system, determine the exchange rate between the circulating currency and the legal tender, and allow parallel use and free exchange; (4) Demand that the government quickly organize and equip the knowledgeable youth and strong refugees in Pan Yang and other places; (5) Demand that the government mobilize the maximum manpower, material resources, and financial resources to defend the Great Northeast; (6) Demand that the Northeast compatriots widely launch a movement to rescue their hometown and defend their motherland; (7) Save the Northeast from danger and consolidate the national defense front line; (8) Demand that the Soviet Union immediately fulfill its treaty obligations and assist the government in taking over the entire Northeast administration, otherwise, please ask the government to declare the abolition of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and implement a severance of relations with the Soviet Union, and file a complaint with the United Nations.

[Another Dispatch] The Northeast Nine Provinces and Three Cities Association in Beijing held a tea party at 4:00 PM on the 29th to welcome the Northeast envoys Zhang Zuoxiang, Ma Zhanshan, Wan Fulin, Zou Zuohua, Zhang Yuanfu, and Han Junjie, Chairman of Heilongjiang, who came to Beijing to report on their duties, presided over by Yu Bin. First, he delivered a welcome speech, then invited Zhang and others to report and the compatriots to speak freely. After that, the Compatriots Association immediately read out the declaration. The tea party lasted for more than two hours, and the atmosphere at the venue was always enthusiastic and grief-stricken, with a strong sense of unity. When Zhang Zuoxiang spoke, he pointed out two points to explain the current situation in the Northeast: (1) The military situation in the Northeast has not stopped for the past two and a half years, and it has become increasingly serious, which is actually related to diplomacy; (2) The reason why the Northeast problem has evolved to the present situation is that manpower and financial resources have not been properly used. He also immediately stated that they were summoned to come this time and have no preconceived notions. Wan expressed that the Northeast compatriots are in deep suffering, and they were specially ordered to come and report. Ma said: "The current seriousness of the Northeast has far exceeded the time of the 'September 18th Incident' and the 'July 7th Incident'. We are deeply afraid that this time we fled, we will not know when we will be able to return? We must use our own strength to save ourselves, otherwise, relying on others, there will be a danger of destruction." Zou specially explained the importance of organization and unity, and Zhang Yuanfu also agreed with this view. When Han Junjie spoke, he was in tears, expressing that he personally failed the country and his fellow villagers, and that he had retreated step by step for more than two years, and he had seen too much heartache everywhere! However, due to various constraints, it was almost impossible for us to say a word or ask a question. Han continued to briefly explain the suffering of the people in the Northeast and the destruction of the Communist bandits. Finally, some fellow villagers, such as Qi Yu, proposed to employ Northeast people to investigate and accept corrupt elements, and to promote young people.

### Part of the Industrial Equipment in the Northeast is Evacuated to Guan Nei; The Resource Commission Plans to Increase Coal Production in South China

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 29th] Senior officials of the Northeast units of the Resource Commission are all in Ping. After Sun Yueqi met with them yesterday, a decision has been generally made on the disposal of industrial equipment in the Northeast. In principle, units that should not be evacuated will be maintained until the end, those that have been occupied will be liquidated within two months, and those that have been evacuated will be distributed to Central China, South China, and Taiwan, and a part will also be sent to North China. The current situation of each unit is maintained by local employees, while one or two senior officials are left to preside over the work. Almost all of the personnel sent to Guanwai to take over have been withdrawn and replaced by local people. The current status of the existing units is as follows: (1) Benxi Coal Mine: Currently presided over by Tian Yuxing, Deputy Director of the Accounting Department, it can still produce 2,000 tons of coal per day, 300 tons of coke, and produce a small amount of special steel for military needs, generating 12,000 kilowatts of electricity. Isolated from the outside world, employees mainly eat bean cakes and sugar. Because it was once occupied by workers, management felt it was difficult, so more than 40 technicians and more than 60 clerks were evacuated, along with about 200 family members, who are all in Ping now. (2) Northeast Metal Mining Company: This company, which was formed by the merger of 64 units, is already at a dead end after Andong was lost. Currently, only the Pan Yang Smelter still produces a small amount of copper skin to supply the military, with about 140 employees. (3) Northeast Cement Company: Originally, six institutions were taken over, two of which were operating, Liaoyang Xiaotun and Benxi. Now Liaoyang has been lost, and Benxi is also trapped, so the products have no way out and production has stopped. The Benxi factory is presided over by Shao Kequan, the acting chief of the engineering section, and the Pan Yang General Company is responsible for the director of the general affairs department, Chuan Qiutou. (4) The Liaoyang, Dalinghe, and Yingkou factories belonging to the Liaoning Paper Company have all been lost. More than a dozen technicians have been evacuated to Ping, living by selling rubber materials. Senior staff will be sent to Taiwan, and one or two will go to Tianjin to work.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 29th] In order to develop coal mines in South China, the Resource Commission established the Ganxi (Gaokeng, Jiangxi), Huxiang, Xiangjiang, Zhongxiang (all in Xiangtan, Hunan), Yongshao (Shaoyang, Hunan), Xiangyong (Yongxing, Hunan), and Nanling (northern Guangdong) coal mines in the three provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong last year. However, due to the low output, Wuhan, Guangzhou and other places still need Shanghai to transport coal to supply them. Recently, there is no hope of transporting coal from the Northeast, and the Kailuan coal mine cannot be transported to the south due to the interruption of the Beining Railway. The coal used in East China and South China now only relies on Huainan, East China and Taiwan. The coal production is not very large, so the Resource Commission has drafted a plan to increase coal production in South China. The content is as follows: (Continued on page 2, column 1)

### Overseas Chinese Returning to the Philippines Face Restrictions

[Central News Agency, Manila, 28th] Overseas Chinese holding re-entry permits issued by the Philippine government in 1941 will be allowed to return to the Philippines. In addition, approximately 2,500 overseas Chinese who left the Philippines between 1937 and 1940 will not be allowed to enter the country. This is the result of negotiations between Philippine Immigration Commissioner Fabre and Clark, the head of the Hong Kong office of the International Refugee Organization, last week. Clark recently arrived here from Hong Kong to enable 2,000 Chinese from the pre-war Philippine Islands to return to the Philippine Islands. These Chinese relied on the relief of the International Refugee Organization while stranded in Xiamen to maintain their lives. Mr. Clark is now leaving here for Hong Kong, where he will submit a report to the headquarters of the International Refugee Organization in Geneva on the results of his mission. It is reported that the 2,500 Chinese who are prohibited from returning to the Philippines collectively can enter the country in succession in accordance with the "Regulations on the Quota of Foreign Nationals Entering the Philippines," which stipulates that 500 Chinese can enter the country each year as temporary tourists or students.

They held a meeting that night to study how the troops inside the Guan could cooperate with the operations outside the Guan, according to the instructions of Chairman Jiang.

[Our Newspaper, Pan Yang, 29th] The Pan Zhou Guan area has become more peaceful, the battle situation in West Shenyang has stabilized, and the morale of the people has greatly improved. A military observer said that the battle situation in the Northeast is like a ball game, with Pan and Harbin as the two goals of the football field and Siping as the midline. In the current situation, it is not a one-sided game. The national army guarding the goal is strong and stable, and the communist bandits' forwards lack the ability to break through the goal and only have brute force, so they will inevitably suffer losses. The national army forwards are in Jilin and Changchun, so we should not worry about this ball game.

[Another Dispatch] After Xin Kaiyuan and Yingkou, it fell into the hands of the bandits on the morning of the 28th. Xin Kaiyuan is located at a station on the China-Changchun Railway, and the old Kaiyuan City is eight kilometers to the east, which the bandits have occupied for a long time. There are only about one division of bandits remaining in the Xinmin area, most of whom are in the northern bunkers. Another action being planned by the bandits may become clear in the coming days. Fuxin, Tieling, or Siping may be the targets of their attempted attack.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 28th] The Communist bandits in western Liaoning gathered approximately the strength of the 7th Column and attacked Xinmin fiercely. On the 28th, the air force dispatched 40 aircraft to assist in the battle, braving the adverse weather conditions. According to unconfirmed news, the defending troops in Xinmin fought hard, but it seems that there are no fixed positions, and the battle situation is gradually becoming difficult to determine. The air force has fiercely bombed and strafed the local Communist bandits.

[Central News Agency, Pan Yang, 29th] On the morning of the 28th, the National Army's westward advance troops continued to search and sweep the east bank of the Liao River towards Xinmin, and there were no bandit forces active along the way.

They seized five stacks of illegal receipts for remittances on behalf of customers and 200 million national currency, as well as many original telegrams sent to Hong Kong, Shanghai, Hankou, and other places. Sending telegrams several times within an hour may be an institution for publishing black market quotations. The firm had more than ten telephones installed. After it was cracked down, the black market for finance was calm for a while, which shows that its scale was not small. In addition to the two people who were arrested on the spot for interrogation, the remaining fugitives are also being investigated. It is heard that this case involves a wide range of people.

### US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Postpones Review of Aid to China Bill; Secret Meeting Scheduled for March 10

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, announced today that the Foreign Relations Committee has postponed its secret meetings to hear opinions on aid to China, Greece, and Turkey bills until March 10. According to participants, those who support military aid to China believe that it would be best to include it in the European Recovery Program, as President Truman would not reject the European Recovery Program in order to stop military aid to China.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Senator Bridges, chairman of the Republican Senate Appropriations Committee, attacked the government's report on aircraft aid to China tonight, calling it a "reluctant and superficial" effort. Bridges said: "As far as I know, since the victory over Japan, the United States has only transported 633 aircraft to China, of which 158 cannot be used due to lack of equipment. Transport planes account for 197 of all aircraft. The government wants to overcome the difficulties at a time when the Chinese Communists are attacking fiercely, so this kind of assistance is completely unsuitable. Since August 1946, not a single fighter or bomber has been transported to China. The government has not supplied aircraft parts to China for two years. A car is useless without gasoline, and so is an aircraft. Unless it can be maintained, the government does not make a real effort to comply with its obligations to China. China needs guns and ammunition for the army, and so far, the government has obviously done nothing about this urgent need."

Editorial

### Academic Atmosphere and Student Unrest

Currently, schools at all levels are closing for vacation, and everyone is naturally paying attention to education. On the 24th of last month, the Ministry of Education issued an order to rectify the academic atmosphere. What kind of effect this order will have is a question in everyone's mind. We have never been very confident in the effectiveness of government orders to rectify the academic atmosphere. However, this time, we believe that the rectification of the academic atmosphere has its value and deserves considerable attention.

Why have we always not valued orders to rectify the academic atmosphere? Because the original meaning of "academic atmosphere" is to represent the comprehensive expression of the prevailing academic thoughts of a certain era and the lifestyle and behavior of the scholars of that era. One era has the prevailing academic thoughts of that era, and the behavioral standards of the scholars of that era, so one era has the academic atmosphere of that era. Therefore, the academic atmosphere of the Wei and Jin dynasties differed from that of the late Han dynasty, and the academic atmosphere of the early Qing dynasty differed from that of the Song dynasty. Although the so-called academic atmosphere of a certain era cannot be clearly explained in a few words, everyone seems to have a tacit understanding and an understanding when it is mentioned. The reason lies in the fact that it is the expression of the academic thoughts and the lifestyle and behavior of the scholars of that era. As long as one knows a little about the academic thoughts and the life of the scholars of that era, one will naturally understand what the academic atmosphere of that era is like.

Because of this, the academic atmosphere is very difficult to rectify. Because the formation of academic thoughts and the expression of the lifestyle and behavior of scholars have their objective and subjective conditions, which cannot be changed by an official document. A good academic atmosphere can only be cultivated gradually, little by little, or through the academic leadership and spiritual inspiration of great thinkers and great scholars. According to this statement, the so-called rectification of the academic atmosphere is naturally not very useful. This is the reason why we have always been suspicious that the academic atmosphere can be rectified.

However, this time, we have a different view on the order to rectify the academic atmosphere. To be honest, because what it wants to rectify is student unrest, not the academic atmosphere. Student unrest and the academic atmosphere are originally two different things and cannot be confused. However, these two things are somewhat related. The ancients said: "I hate purple stealing the place of vermilion, and I hate the music of Zheng disrupting elegant music." The academic atmosphere is vermilion, and student unrest is purple. The academic atmosphere is elegant music, and student unrest is the music of Zheng. The academic atmosphere originally has two ends, one end is excellent, and the other end is corrupt. A corrupt academic atmosphere is like a person's body weakening. But a weak body is not necessarily sick. As for the occurrence of student unrest, it is like being sick. To turn a weak body into a healthy one, one needs proper nutrition, attention to hygiene, exercise, to boost spirits, and psychological comfort. This belongs to the scope of cultivating the academic atmosphere. As for a weak body becoming ill, one must get injections and take medicine. The current rectification of the academic atmosphere should first take injections and medicine, and secondly, find ways to provide nutrition.

Let's talk about the first step first. There has been too much student unrest in the past year! We have made a small statistic based on newspapers. In the past year, a total of 142 incidents of student unrest occurred in colleges and universities across the country, involving 82 schools. Secondary schools are not included. The school with the most incidents of student unrest experienced ten incidents in one year. The school that wasted the most time only had six weeks of classes in half a year! In the past year, students have taken strikes and petitions as commonplace. Using democracy and freedom as a banner, they insulted teachers and attacked the government. Using the constitution as a cover, they beat each other and clashed with the police. Not only was this the case in the past year, but this trend is still brewing and continuing, and there is a real need to rectify it.

Why is there so much student unrest? We must clearly point out that this is created by the Communist Party and its peripheral elements. This incident is extremely obvious. For example, although some student unrests initially started from individual issues, or even for patriotic events, they often changed their nature later on. The student unrest in May last year was originally just a matter of school site issues and funding issues in a few schools, but later it turned into a nationwide "anti-hunger" and "anti-civil war", and the Communist Party's rampant "eat-all movement." That student unrest almost reached an uncontrollable point. This is a clear manifestation of the Communist Party using student unrest as a second battlefield.

The Communist Party and its foreign countries launch student unrests in an organized, planned, and highly mobile manner. When an incident occurs in one school, other schools immediately echo it. When action is taken in area A, area B immediately responds. On May 13th last year, students from Shanghai Jiao Tong University went to the North Railway Station, and on the same day, Nanjing Central University went on strike. From May 20th to May 26th, one school petitioned the Ministry of Education every day in one week, implementing its one-strike-a-day policy. Another example is the Tongji University student unrest in January this year. As soon as this side was preparing to go to Beijing, the other side had already contacted and prepared accommodation in Nanjing. A student union incident in one school even mobilized people from several schools to send them off, and some even came all the way from Beiping to send them off. It was originally a student incident, but factory workers also went to participate. Such organized and planned actions do not need to wait for the discovery of Communist Party documents to see that it is the work of the Communist Party and its peripheral elements.

In the summer of the year before last, when the "Democratic League" had not yet been disbanded, they carried out various strategies in Shanghai. At that time, they published a "Shanghai Cultural Circle National Crisis Education Plan." It had the following statement: "Only the practical actions of national liberation are education for national salvation!" The so-called national liberation is naturally international communism; using international communism as an educational goal, what is the intention? Isn't this clearly trying to turn the entire education into a tool for communist struggle? The original plan also said: "All educators, in cooperation with all democratic fighters, using all democratic forces, to strive for the realization of democratic politics is the true democratic education." This is even more blatantly trying to collude with the communists, overthrow the government, and even claim that this is democratic education. This is a real slander against democratic education! The Communist Party and its peripheral elements using schools as a second battlefield have given us extremely clear evidence in this document. Therefore, since then, student unrest has been going on one after another. Today, the government is rectifying the academic atmosphere, and the first step should be to persuade the principals of each school to eliminate the lurking communists and their followers in the schools.

Secondly, education itself has also suffered from weakness, and has a congenital deficiency and acquired maladjustment. In terms of school buildings and equipment, although it has been two years since the restoration, it has not yet reached a sufficient level. The regular expenses of the school, even the largest university, are only over 100 million yuan per month, and ordinary ones are only 50 to 60 million yuan. Paying for water and electricity alone is not enough, and it is impossible to talk about purchasing other equipment! In the national budget, an amount of foreign exchange was allocated for the purchase of equipment for national colleges and universities across the country, but the amount was very small. It was 500,000 US dollars the year before last, and it was still 500,000 US dollars last year and this year. On average, each school only receives a few thousand yuan per year, and after buying magazines and newspapers, there is nothing left. It is even more difficult to talk about scientific equipment. As for the treatment of teachers, their monthly income is "not enough to support their parents, and not enough to raise their wives and children." They are in extreme difficulty, crying for hunger and cold. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to even maintain life, let alone engage in academic research? Even if there are those who are studious, willing to endure hunger and cold, and do not complain, and want to engage in academic research, it is impossible to do so due to equipment difficulties. In this way, the content of academics cannot be enriched at all, and how can a good academic atmosphere be cultivated?

Therefore, there are two aspects to rectifying the academic atmosphere? First, to reduce student unrest, and second, to increase education funding, enrich school buildings and equipment, and cultivate educational vitality. Regarding the second point, the government should of course take more responsibility. Regarding the first point, it is not only the responsibility of the government, but also the principals and teachers of schools, and young people who truly love their studies, should all be vigilant and responsible. As long as the Communist Party and its peripheral elements are not eliminated, the education field cannot be stabilized. The country and individuals will suffer together!

### Chairperson Chiang's Speech at the Inaugural Meeting

Encouraging to Love Other People's Children as Our Own

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] Madam Chiang said in her speech at the inaugural meeting of the China Committee for the United Nations Fundraising for Children's Relief Fund on the 29th:

Today is the day when the United Nations universally launches fundraising for the world's refugee children relief fund. It gives every country an opportunity to give play to the spirit of universal love. As a member of the United Nations, China should do its best to participate in this righteous cause.

There are about 300 million impoverished and suffering children in the world, accounting for more than one-fifth of the total world population, of which about 64 million are in our country. The United Nations has taken on this difficult task to speak for these 300 million children, raise funds, and solve their problems of food, clothing, and shelter. Its ambition is truly worthy of our admiration.

This campaign is appealing to the responsibility of mankind. If we are indifferent to the hunger and cold of suffering children, then we are giving up our responsibility to build a beautiful world for the next generation. This movement is calling on our compatriots across the country to recognize the responsibilities we shoulder and fulfill our obligations.

This fundraising campaign will adopt a voluntary donation method, and the proceeds will be distributed to poor children all over the world, regardless of race, religion, nationality, or political belief, equally and without discrimination. Every penny donated will be given entirely to refugee children, and if there are expenses required for fundraising, other ways will be found.

During our country's eight-year war of resistance in the past, we received many gifts from foreign friends, and wartime refugee children benefited a lot. Some countries themselves were also in poverty and hardship, but they were still generous in helping us. This spirit is especially worthy of our gratitude. Recently, the United Nations has designated 3.5 million US dollars to help Chinese children. I think you must have the same feeling as me that we cannot only accept and not want to give.

We must know that giving is more blessed than receiving. Abundant sowing will surely lead to abundant harvests. Our China is indeed also in poverty, but this move is to promote the spirit of universal love. Therefore, our sharing of clothes and food is naturally more meaningful than enjoying it alone. Our ancient proverb says, "Love other people's children as our own." Let us fully express this traditional virtue of the Chinese nation.

The members of the China Committee of the United Nations World Refugee Children's Relief are known for their enthusiasm for public good and are very enthusiastic about the public welfare of the world. Many members are here today for the meeting. During our difficult and arduous war of resistance, you all used your time, energy, or material contributions to reduce the suffering of wartime children and refugees. I hope that everyone can use the same wholehearted efforts to promote the work of this relief for refugee children around the world and be an advocate for our people across the country. The most glorious achievement in life is to have the power to help others. Today is our opportunity to make the most practical contribution to mankind in the world. We should not expect others' gratitude or reward in the slightest, but respond generously to this fundraising campaign.

### Central Training Corps Celebrates 10th Anniversary

Memorial Ceremony Held This Morning, Commander Chiang Will Personally Deliver a Speech

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] The Central Training Corps has been established for ten years. March 1st is the 10th anniversary. The corps is scheduled to hold a memorial ceremony at the headquarters of the corps in Xiaolingwei at 9:00 a.m. Commander Chiang, who is also the corps commander, will personally preside over the ceremony and give a speech.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Central Training Corps, the alumni who graduated from the various classes of the corps and stayed in Nanjing plan to hold a grand spring reunion at the corps headquarters in Xiaolingwei on the 1st.

At 8:00 p.m., Education Director Huang Jie will be invited to give a speech on "Promoting the Training Spirit of the Central Training Corps" at the Central Broadcasting Station. The Central Training Corps was established in the early stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Before Wuhan was lost, it trained a large number of military officers and party and group education cadres. During the three months of transferring to Lingling, Hunan, it trained three major detachments of honorary officers, all of whom were unknown heroes in the early stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Since the corps moved to Chongqing, it has established party and government training classes. Since then, a total of 31 party and government classes have been held, training 22,970 people, 3 advanced party and government classes, 426 people, 18 military service cadre training classes, 2,809 people, 5 youth cadre classes, 1,543 people, 9 social worker training classes, 1,059 people, 5 personnel management training classes, 1,404 people, 4 audio cadre classes, 285 people, 2 military law classes, 337 people, 1 Taiwan administrative cadre training class, 158 people, 5 scout coach training classes, 1,178 people, 2 journalism classes, 243 people, 2 training classes for students studying in Japan, 283 people, and 5 translator training classes, 1,007 people. Adding the two periods of Luojia Mountain and Lingling, a total of more than 37,000 people were trained. Some of these graduates have died for the country during the War of Resistance Against Japan, so the people of the country often compare the corps to a spiritual fortress in the War of Resistance Against Japan. The Central Training Corps currently has a total of 50,000 officers, soldiers, and students. There are a total of 33 military officer general (large) detachments and 6 branch regiments nationwide, training 190,000 military officers. The corps may convene the fourth advanced training class, hoping to cultivate a group of new cadres with a higher political demeanor at the beginning of the constitutional government, in order to establish a new national style of righteousness and uprightness in the international community.

### Aid to Europe Plan Transferred to the US Senate, International Situation is Critical and Urgent, Vandenberg Urges Early Passage and Implementation

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg said today that after the Czech event, the European Recovery Program has become increasingly urgent, and the time factor has become the main element of the US's future actions. The European Recovery Program will be discussed in the Senate starting Monday, and it is hoped that this program can be resolved before discussing other aid bills and submitted to the House of Representatives for discussion on March 15. The other bills referred to by Vandenberg are the new plans for aid to China and aid to Greece and Turkey.

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recently issued a report on aid to Europe, showing that the committee confirmed that European countries will not be able to maintain their freedom and independence without assistance. The report will be attached to the committee's draft aid to Europe bill and sent to the Senate together on Monday. The report states: "What must be decided today is whether we will continue to work to achieve the goal of building a stable world, establishing a free political system and the rule of law. The stability of the world is inextricably linked to the stability of Europe. Free institutions and true independence must not be allowed to perish in Europe or be threatened elsewhere in the world. Therefore, we should base our decision on the resolution that has been made, that is, whether Europe can maintain its freedom and independence without economic recovery, and decide the path we should follow. This committee is well aware that Europe cannot maintain its freedom and independence without economic recovery, and therefore has given the most sincere review to the European Recovery Program." The report then continued to discuss the Soviet Union's attitude towards the European Recovery Program, stating, "The Soviet Union and the communist parties of other European countries, their position can greatly help the European Recovery Program, or it can harm the success of the program. Recent developments show that the path to be taken by the communist party is mostly the latter. The communist party has repeatedly slandered the US's motives for the European Recovery Program through the Communist Information Bureau. In some countries participating in the program, communist-led labor strikes and riots have occurred, thereby hindering Europe's production efforts. The Soviet Union especially has a unique position to obstruct the recovery of trade between Eastern and Western Europe. The recent trade agreements that have been established or are under negotiation between Eastern and Western Europe are encouraging."

### Advocating Keeping the Door Open to Eastern European Countries

The report states that the economic health of Europe and the development of closer political and economic relations between European countries are important factors for both peace and prosperity. Therefore, the ultimate goal of the European Recovery Program is not only economic cooperation in the form of customs unions, but also closer political and cultural ties. Regarding the issue of participating countries, the report advocates keeping the door open to Finland, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union, so that they can participate. As for whether Spain can ultimately participate, it should depend on whether the country is willing to accept the obligations under the plan, whether other participating countries are willing to accommodate Spain, and whether Spain can conclude a satisfactory agreement with the industry country. The report finally stated that this kind of assistance in peacetime is unprecedented in human history. European countries know that the United States has made this major decision, and its responsibilities are no less than those of European countries. Its purpose is to seek common welfare and peace, and people around the world must have a common understanding of this.

### Western European Alliance Plan, Preliminary Technical Discussions by Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, Meeting of Prime Ministers of Five Countries in the Works

[Reuters, Brussels, 29th] Belgian Prime Minister Spaak said in an exclusive interview with our reporter that the meeting of the Prime Ministers of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to discuss the Western European Alliance Plan is in the works. He put forward the suggestion to convene this meeting last week, and a resolution can be made soon. However, before the talks between the Prime Ministers of the five countries, a solid foundation for negotiations must be prepared.

Therefore, it is possible that experts will first hold preliminary technical discussions on issues related to the establishment of the Western European Alliance in one of the five capitals. These discussions may be held in parallel with the Three Powers' meeting on the German issue currently being held in London. When the reporter mentioned the rumor in New York that the United States is planning to conclude a treaty of alliance with Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, Spaak said that he had not heard of such a plan. He then said that if it is true, it is an extremely important matter and should be given the most careful consideration. Spaak also expressed his hope that the recent events in Eastern Europe will not change the trend that the Marshall Plan is expected to pass smoothly in the United States recently. The Marshall Plan is becoming more and more necessary and should be passed and implemented quickly.

### Conference of Sixteen European Countries to be Convened in Mid-March

Invitation Letters Have Been Sent by Britain and France

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] It was announced here that Britain and France have sent invitations to the other fourteen countries participating in the Marshall Plan, inviting them to reopen the Conference of Sixteen European Countries in mid-March. The date of the meeting is tentatively set for March 15, which may be delayed by a few days. Bevin and Bidault will personally attend two plenary sessions.

[Reuters, London, 29th] The conference of socialists from sixteen European countries to discuss the Marshall Plan will be held in London on March 21. The official position that the British Labour Party delegation will take at the conference has become the goal of discussion among Labour Party members. Their opinions are divided into two factions. One faction is the federalist faction led by MacKay, which advocates the establishment of a political merger between Western European countries under a European constitutional assembly. The other faction is the pragmatist faction led by Labour Party left-wing leader Crossman, which advocates the establishment of a Western European alliance with only state-level economic concepts. Crossman's faction advocates the establishment of a permanent European executive agency, with representatives from West Germany also able to participate as observers, and plans to establish a common commodity bureau to implement the unified procurement of food and raw materials. In addition, a common planning bureau will be established to formulate an emergency plan within twelve months, paying special attention to agriculture.

### Finland Prepares to Accept Soviet Proposal, Stalin's Letter Published, Finnish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Recalled Yesterday

[Reuters, Helsinki, 28th] According to our sources, most of the political parties in Finland are prepared to accept Marshal Stalin's proposal to conclude a treaty of military assistance and friendship with the Soviet Union equal to the Soviet-Hungarian and Soviet treaties. According to a broadcast from Moscow Radio of Marshal Stalin's letter to Finnish President Paasikivi, the full text is as follows:

"In order to actively improve the relationship between the Soviet Union and Finland and to consolidate peace and security, the Soviet government proposes that the Soviet Union and Finland conclude a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance equal to the Soviet-Hungarian and Soviet treaties. If Finland does not object, it is hoped that a delegation will be sent to the Soviet Union to conclude this treaty. If the Finnish government believes that negotiations should be held in Finland, the Soviet government is also prepared to send a delegation to Helsinki. Sincerely, Stalin, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers." In addition to attaching the previous letter, the Soviet government's note to the Finnish government pointed out that Finland is the only country bordering the Soviet Union that was a former enemy and has not yet concluded such a treaty with the Soviet Union. The Soviet note did not stipulate a deadline for Finland's response, so the Finnish Parliament will discuss the matter in accordance with constitutional procedures.

[United Press Agency, Helsinki, 29th] The Finnish ambassador to the Soviet Union is expected to arrive here on the 29th. However, well-informed sources expressed doubt about the ambassador carrying a new note from the Soviet government. These people believe that the ambassador was recalled to report to the government on the Soviet Union's attitude towards the proposed Soviet-Finnish alliance treaty.

[United Press Agency, Helsinki, 28th] Soviet Ambassador Savonenkov entered the presidential residence today for a seven-minute meeting in order to hear the Finnish government's views on Stalin's proposal. Finnish politicians admitted that the Soviet Union has a powerful weapon, which is grain. Without grain from the Soviet Union, Finland will face famine. Political leaders and the public are opposed to forming an alliance with any country, but the Communist Party supports the proposal.

[United Press Agency, Helsinki, 28th] The Finnish president may send a delegation to Moscow before Tuesday to participate in negotiations. Although Moscow Radio broadcast tonight that the Soviet-Finnish treaty is aimed at preventing future aggression by the general country, both countries suffered heavy damage from German aggression. If the same thing happens again, both governments should be responsible to their people. However, what most people are most concerned about is whether Stalin's request is purely to protect Soviet territory, especially Leningrad, or whether he has other intentions.

### Internal Dispute in Yemen, Al-Achim Goes to Mediate

### World Rice Conference Opens in Baguio Today, China is Expected to be Elected Vice Chairman of the Conference

[Central News Agency, Baguio, 28th] The preparatory committee for the FAO rice conference held a two-hour secret meeting this afternoon to prepare for the rice conference that will open on March 1. At the meeting, the suggestion of Xie Chengping, the chief representative of China, was accepted, and it was decided that the rice conference should have two vice chairmen. Observers believe that the Philippines, as the host country, is very likely to be elected chairman of the conference, and China and India, as the two major rice-consuming countries in Asia, will be elected vice chairmen. The preparatory meeting decided to establish four subcommittees to study: (1) production, (2) market and distribution, (3) the proposed international rice organization, and (4) a four-year plan to increase rice production and improve the world economy. China has formally requested the establishment of a nutrition research center and an Indian Ocean-Pacific Fisheries Committee in the Nutrition and Fisheries Committees.

### The Korean Commission Will Leave the US Tomorrow to Fly to Seoul to Resume Work; South Korea Will Start General Elections, Earliest in Early May

[United Press, New York, 28th] Persons close to the United Nations Korean Commission predicted on the 28th: The earliest date for Korea to start elections will be May 2nd. The commissioners here will fly to Seoul on March 2nd and arrive on March 6th, so that the commissioners who have arrived there can resume work on March 8th.

Their progress will be closely watched by Lake Success, as some diplomats there are deeply concerned that the current chaos in southern Korea may postpone the May 2nd election. One of the commission's first tasks on March 8th will be to study the conditions for supervising and observing the election, and to decide whether the general election will include certain areas. In this regard, the extent to which the commission will accept US assistance is also under consideration. Some people here believe that too much US assistance will provoke criticism that US pressure is affecting the election results.

[United Press, Seoul, 28th] Military Governor Lieutenant General Lerch reiterated the order to the provincial police chiefs, urging them to maintain law and order and to be responsible to their respective provincial governors. This move is apparently to prevent the police from interfering in the upcoming general election.

### US Authorities in Korea Deny the Trench Digging Rumor on the Border

A US military official spokesman said: Trenches along the border for tactical training or other purposes have never been built before, nor are they being built now. The spokesman also said that there are no artillery units within several miles of the border.

The telegraph listed the cruiser "Sheffield", the "Truant" Class and the destroyer "Sparrow" into Guatemalan territory in Belize. The Guatemalan government formally declared its opposition to these actions by the United Kingdom to the United Nations. The Guatemalan government solemnly denied the British accusations and strongly protested the entry of British warships into Guatemalan territory. Guatemala awaits action by the United Nations to resolve public concerns.

Prime Minister Gottwald addressed the Farmers' Committee this morning, stating that he would resolutely rectify the administrative organs and planned to pass a large-scale legislative program before holding new elections in accordance with the law. Gottwald also emphasized the need to eradicate reactionary forces in political parties, legal entities, and public institutions. Speaking of the government's general plan, he said that at the request of the trade unions, the government would abolish private wholesale operations, nationalize imports and exports, and convert all private enterprises employing more than fifty people into state-owned enterprises. The interests of handicraftsmen and small traders would be guaranteed in the constitution. According to the announcement of the Czech Central Action Committee, the national life of Czechoslovakia will be concentrated within the reorganized National Front. The resolutions of the National Front are binding on all parties. Political parties cannot engage in political activities without the approval of the Action Committee.

### Political Developments in Marato, West Java; The Conciliation Committee Will Pay Attention; The Security Council Passes the Proposal of Our Representative

[United Press, Lake Success, 29th] The United Nations Security Council resolved on the 29th to extend the life of the Indonesian-Dutch Mediation Committee. The Soviet Union abstained from the vote. Indonesia accused the Netherlands of instigating the establishment of a puppet state on the territory of the Republic of Indonesia. The Security Council demanded an immediate investigation into the matter. The Security Council requested the Mediation Committee to continue to perform its duties and to negotiate a permanent political solution based on the recent ceasefire agreement successfully negotiated. Colombia proposed to put more effort into the committee, but it was rejected.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 28th] As the Security Council debated the Indonesian issue today, it passed a resolution proposed by China, ordering the United Nations Mediation Committee to pay special attention to the political developments in West Java and Madura Island. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, and Argentina all abstained. The Security Council also passed a resolution proposed by Canada, asking Indonesia and the Netherlands to make more use of the services of the United Nations Mediation Committee. This resolution did not give the Mediation Committee more power than before, unlike the resolution proposed by China, which expanded the Mediation Committee's powers to West Java and Madura. The debate on the Indonesian issue has now come to a temporary end.

### The Memoirs of Hull (3)(6)

It is always good to cooperate with people

In the late autumn of 1944, my colleagues and I began to suspect that Stalin and his government had begun to deviate from the policy of cooperation they had agreed to at the Moscow Conference, a policy they had followed until now with few exceptions.

We began to learn of signs that the Soviet Union would demand a high price in the peace treaties with Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, allowing them to almost take control of these countries. At the same time, we were also forced to pay close attention to the Soviet Union's tough stance on the voting issue in the Security Council.

So, on September 18, I sent a telegram to Ambassador Harriman in Moscow, mentioning the voting issue that had occurred at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference. I said that this matter, coupled with some other recent developments reported by Harriman, had raised great doubts in our minds about the Soviet Union's long-term policy in the future. I also said that I had begun to suspect that Stalin and the Kremlin giants had decided to change the policy they had established at the Moscow and Tehran Conferences and take a completely opposite path. Therefore, I wanted Harriman to make an assessment of the current trend of Soviet policy so that we could decide how to deal with this possible change in Soviet attitude.

I told Harriman that it would be even more helpful if he could tell me his views on why this shift in Soviet policy toward the United States had occurred, and why the Soviet attitude toward Britain had become tougher.

The next day, Harriman replied by telegram, citing several instances of unilateral Soviet action or apparent unwillingness to cooperate with the United States and Britain. He said: We have sufficient evidence to anticipate that if we establish such an international organization that stipulates that in the event of any international dispute, discussion must be approved by all permanent members, regardless of whether it is a party to the dispute itself, the Soviet government will ruthlessly resist the Security Council from discussing any issue that it believes will affect its own interests. The Soviet government will insist that such matters should be resolved directly by the Soviet Union and other parties concerned, especially any disputes between it and its neighbors.

Harriman expressed his confidence that Stalin and his key advisors placed the overall cooperation between the Soviet Union and the other three powers in the most important position, but they hoped that their political and military strength could enable them to control the situation. He said that there was no doubt that the Soviet people longed for peace and believed that the close relationship developed with Britain and the United States during the war would continue after the war and ensure a long-term and lasting peace.

The ambassador did not believe that Stalin could abandon the material and psychological value of this cooperation without causing serious anxiety among the Soviet people. However, there were still some powerful figures close to Stalin who were unwilling to give up their right to independent action in areas related to Soviet interests, and unwilling to see the Soviet Union rely entirely on a world organization that had not yet been tried and to cooperate with countries they did not fully trust. Harriman felt that Stalin liked to be prepared for anything, so naturally, he would use both methods at the same time to obtain his country's security and enhance what he believed to be his country's interests.

When I left the State Department, the Soviet policy I advocated was based on two foundations. The first is: continue to conduct regular and friendly consultations with the Soviet Union. Consult with them on any event. Explain to them the principles we believe are necessary to promote international peace relations, and if necessary, explain again and again as clearly as possible that the Soviet Union can gain more benefits by fully cooperating with other countries, while controlling neighboring countries has very few benefits. Make it clear to them that we are not opposed to a country promoting the merits of its own form of government, whether it is communism or democracy, but we are opposed to a country interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

I hoped that if my health allowed me to continue in office, I could persuade the Soviet Union to adopt a policy of cooperation and non-interference that is commonly practiced in the Western Hemisphere, and make this a firm world policy that all countries can abide by. Under this Pan-American policy transplanted to Europe, the Soviet Union could maintain the most friendly political relations and the most vigorous economic exchange with its neighbors without interfering in their internal affairs.

The second part of our Soviet policy was: to give the Soviet Union a practical example through our own actions, telling them how we felt they should behave. So I opposed the opinion of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to have the United States retain the Pacific islands seized from the Japanese. I strongly felt that all colonies seized from the Axis countries should be placed under the United Nations governing system, without exception. It was easy to see that the Soviet Union would be dissatisfied with our immediate possession of these islands; but it was also easy to see that the Soviet Union would use this as a precedent for similar possessions in the future. If we took possession of these islands, we would no longer be able to oppose similar actions by other countries in the future.

Therefore, I also opposed the planned Chapultepec Act passed at the Mexico City Conference in March 1945, after I resigned from the war, in which the American republics actually agreed to military intervention in any one of them under certain circumstances. Once we agreed to this new interventionist status, the Soviet Union would have even more reason to interfere in its neighbors, and we would have no reason to oppose it.

Similarly, I was also unwilling to endorse the plan advocated by Charles, together with the army and navy authorities, to standardize the military equipment of the Western Hemisphere, which meant that the United States would equip the Latin American republics well during peacetime. I felt that it would be a difficult and unfair thing to arm them and require them to fight when necessary, because we knew they could not fight, and their help to us, as shown in the Second World War, was more important in terms of economic and base use than in terms of battlefield help.

At the same time, I also opposed changing our wartime policy of uncompromising opposition to the nationalist regime of Argentina, which had allied itself with the Nazis. The compromise attitude at the Mexico City and San Francisco conferences, which allowed Argentina to join the United Nations, weakened the mutual trust that could have existed between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Roosevelt and I had very similar views on the Soviet issue. We both felt that the road of relations between the two countries was not a smooth one, but we also felt that we could live together with the Soviet Union. As far as I can remember, the President and I had no disagreement on this basic assumption, that we must and can live together amicably with the Soviet government.

The President and Stalin, Churchill discussed the issues at the Yalta Conference, he did not discuss it with me beforehand, and I did not know anything about the secret concessions given to the Soviet Union at the meeting. I did not know about them until the secret agreement was made public later. Yalta was the only international conference attended by President Roosevelt after I left office. My opinions on various issues between the great powers are recorded in detail in the minutes of the State Department's regular meetings and conversations. When I left office, I still opposed giving the Soviet Union more voting rights than our own. My view was that each major power, with such strong desires and influence, could obtain a full expression of its rights and interests at any time without any problems, and did not need to retain more than one vote.

After I resigned, when the President came to visit me in the hospital, including his last visit a few days before his death, he never mentioned to me any fear that the Soviet Union would abandon our movement for peaceful cooperation or would obstruct or undermine it. Because he and I had been working together since 1933 to achieve a better understanding with the Soviet Union, and of course, our common plan for a peace organization went without saying, so I firmly believe that if he had indeed felt that the Soviet Union was taking a dangerous path, he would have mentioned it to me.

One might say that the President and I were deceived by the Soviet promises and guarantees, that we should have known that it was impossible to deal with the Soviet Union, that we should have seen long ago that a democratic United States could not be friends with a communist government, so we should have adopted a policy of containment toward the Soviet Union from the beginning.

But when we look back at our relationship with Moscow, I feel, as President Roosevelt also felt, that we had every reason to adopt this friendly policy. Since 1917, the Soviet Union had struggled with many countries that refused to recognize it, and these countries refused to recognize it, in part because of the Soviet Union's policy of directing and inciting rebellion from Moscow. Through long-term efforts, it gradually gained recognition from more countries, and almost every time negotiations were conducted to recognize the Soviet Union, it had to agree not to engage in subversive activities against countries that established relations with it.

It is true that it did not completely abandon this activity. But we felt that other countries, as long as they firmly organized, built up, and strengthened world opinion against this activity, could prompt the Soviet Union to abandon this strategy of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. The fact shows that the President and I took strong measures against the Soviet government several times during the period from recognizing the Soviet Union in 1933 to the Moscow Conference in 1943. I never missed an opportunity to point out to the Soviet Union the benefits to itself of abandoning that thorny policy of interference.

The President and I believed that it was in the best interests of the Soviet Union itself to fully become a member of the United Nations security mechanism and to cooperate with it wholeheartedly, and that the Soviet leaders would recognize this fact. We believed at the time, and I still believe now, that the United Nations organization would eventually become a unified and powerful body with sufficient power to maintain peace. We also knew that there would be difficulties, some of which would come from the Soviet Union. The United Nations organization would have to go through a period of wavering and fragility; but by the end of 1944, we were certain that we and the countries that were working with us had laid the foundation for this planned mechanism, in which the Soviet Union and we could cooperate together.

On several occasions in our relations with the Soviet Union, the President and I often received the definite opinion of our senior military generals, saying that from their military point of view, friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union after the war was also very necessary.

### Six Thousand New Recruits Drawn by Lottery; Family Allowance of Ten Stones of Rice per Person; Volunteers Allowed to Enlist to Offset the Catching Quota; Processing to Begin Immediately and Completed by the End of June

[Reported by this newspaper] This year's conscription conference in this city was held at the City Council yesterday morning at 9:00 am. After detailed discussions at the meeting, it was decided that the method of conscription for this year would be based on lottery, but if there were people who were eager to enlist and voluntarily applied for enlistment and were indeed registered in this city, they would still be allowed to enlist to offset the quota. The date of the conscription was decided to begin immediately and be completed by the end of June. The eight key resolutions of yesterday's meeting are as follows: (1) Whether this city's conscription for the 37th year of the Republic should adopt the voluntary soldier method or implement regular conscription according to law. The advantages and disadvantages of the two methods are listed and a proposal is made for public resolution. Resolution: Conscription by lottery will be the principle, but if there are people who are eager to enlist and voluntarily apply for enlistment and are indeed registered in this city, they will still be allowed to enlist to offset the quota. (2) When should the conscription date for this city this year be determined? Resolution: Process immediately until the end of June. (3) Please confirm the family allowance for new recruits in the 37th year of the Republic. Resolution: 1. Each new recruit will be given ten stones of medium-cooked rice. 2. It will be paid in three installments. The first installment will be 50% upon the new recruit's entry into the camp, 25% will be paid three months later, and 25% will be paid three months later. 3. It will be coordinated and allocated by the Conscription Association. (4) The responsibility for the physical examination of new recruits should end when the new recruits have been assigned to the troops. Resolution: The decision will be made after consultation between the Civil Affairs Bureau, the Garrison Headquarters, the Regiment Headquarters, and the Conscription Association. (5) Unify the condolence matters for new recruits. Resolution: The Civil Affairs Bureau and the Conscription Association will negotiate a unified method and issue a circular to all districts for implementation. (6) Strictly manage young men of conscription age to prevent evasion of military service. Resolution: To be handled by the Civil Affairs Bureau. (7) There have been many changes in the roster of young men in the 36th year of the Republic, and it is proposed to recompile it to maintain accuracy. Resolution: To be handled by the Civil Affairs Bureau. (8) The conscription expenses handled by the district offices should be regulated. Resolution: Passed in principle and handed over to the Conscription Association for planning and processing.

Yesterday's meeting was presided over by Mayor Wu. The attendees included Pan Gongzhan, Chairman of the Conscription Association; Standing Committee members Du Yuesheng and Xu Jiyin; Fu Zhengmo, Commander of the Shanghai Garrison; Chen Tianqiao, Commander of the Regiment; Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau; as well as district chiefs, chairmen of district people's representative conferences, and representatives of various agencies, totaling more than 100 people. Wei Rulin, Director of the Conscription Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, and Li Wenshan, Deputy Commander of the Jiangzhe Garrison, attended the meeting for guidance. Chairman Mayor Wu delivered the opening remarks, briefly saying: Last year, the city's conscription was completed on schedule and in full thanks to the assistance of the City Council and the Conscription Association. Although there were some shortcomings, conscription in Shanghai was the first time, which was not easy. This year's conscription was ordered by the Central Government, and the quota has been doubled. Reviewing the shortcomings of the past, how to make this year's performance perfect depends on everyone's full expression of opinions.

### Deputy Director Wei Instructs Four Points: The Central Government Urgently Needs Troops; No Postponement or Reduction of Quota is Allowed

Wei Rulin, Deputy Director of the Conscription Bureau, who attended the meeting for guidance, then gave a speech, conveying four instructions on conscription in this city, briefly saying: (1) During the period of suppressing the rebellion, the Central Government urgently needs troops, so during the national conscription, one cannot postpone the date and two cannot reduce the quota. Shanghai's troop quota is 6,000, which must be completed before the end of June. Now Shanghai has a population of more than 5 million, accounting for only a little more than one-thousandth of the country's population. Other provinces and regions in the country are coordinating the rebellion in politics, economy, and culture. Their conscription system focuses on the militia, so replenishment is rapid and noteworthy for our conscription reference. (3) Shanghai's volunteer soldiers last year achieved satisfactory results. If a lottery can be used this year, it would be best. If it is unavoidable to use volunteer soldiers, it is also acceptable, but the family allowance for new recruits cannot be given in one lump sum. It is necessary to regularly subsidize their families, and the guarantor must be reliable, and the validity period must be two years, until the time of discharge. (4) Some people believe that China already has 4 or 5 million soldiers, so why must Shanghai conscript 6,000 people? However, from a national perspective, Shanghai cannot not conscript. Shanghai is an international metropolis, and not conscripting would be unfair. Deputy Director Wei especially pointed out that this city's conscription quota for this term is 6,000, and another quota will be determined later according to military needs. Next, Deputy Commander Li, Speaker Pan, Commander Fu, and Director Zhang successively delivered speeches.

### Pan, Chairman of the Board, suggests local training for new recruits to protect their hometown

Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Municipal Council and Chairman of the Military Service Association, rushed back from the capital yesterday morning to attend the Military Service Conference. In his address yesterday, Mr. Pan suggested that the 6,000 new recruits conscripted by this municipality should be trained locally to protect the area. He also appealed to those with money to donate generously so that the strong young men can enlist without worry, and to those with strength to contribute their efforts.

The main points of Chairman Pan's speech are as follows: (1) From the instructions of Deputy Director Wei of the Military Service Bureau, we have gained a new insight regarding conscription. That is, how the Communists mobilize the people's power to destroy production and betray the country. Therefore, we must all recognize, especially the citizens of Shanghai, that there is no survival for us if the Communists exist. Why is it that the Communists have no shortage of soldiers, while we find conscription difficult? The reason lies entirely in the method. We should understand ourselves and our enemy, abandon our weaknesses and adopt their strengths, starting with the psychology of the people and the needs of the locality, and then seek to thoroughly understand the nation's military service policy. (2) How should this city implement this year's conscription? I believe that the 6,000 strong young men conscripted according to the Conscription Law should be trained locally in this city and formed into a local defense force, fully developing the concept of everyone protecting their hometown, and ensuring the safety of this city. This city is the largest industrial and commercial city in the country, and half of the national tax revenue depends on this city. Therefore, protecting the safety of this city is tantamount to protecting the safety of the country. Moreover, new recruits must have sufficient training before they can develop the habit of military life and the skills to fight in defense of the area. In the future, they can be promoted step by step. When the training reaches a certain period, there will be patriotic young men who volunteer and eagerly compete to defend the country, and the citizens of this city will surely reward them with high respect, treat them preferentially, and ensure the security of their families, so that they will be brave in killing the enemy and have no worries about the future.

Gun not leaving man, man not leaving hometown

(3) Moreover, General Marshall, during his time in the military and after returning to the United States, criticized our country's military administration, focusing on the improvement of the personnel replenishment system. General Marshall strongly opposed sending rural young men who had not received any training to the front lines. I personally strongly agree with this. Therefore, the Military Service Association proposed at this meeting that the first batch of 6,000 conscripts in this city this year should be trained locally in this city, with the first mission being to protect the area. If so, then this conscription in this city will be a matter of guns not leaving men, men not leaving their hometowns, first cultivating the habit of everyone being willing to serve in the military, and all eligible young men will surely rush to join. Moreover, this progressive and improved conscription method is already advocated by many senior generals at the front. This city is a place of great concern both at home and abroad, and should take the lead in advocating it, as a starting point for gradually improving the military service system.

Contribute strength if you have it, contribute money if you have it

(4) Serving in the military is a national duty, and it should be promoted fairly according to the principle of "contribute strength if you have it, contribute money if you have it." Last year, this city conscripted 3,000 men, adopting the volunteer system. Although the cooperation between the government and civil organizations was not entirely ideal, it was fortunate that the quota was met, which is gratifying. However, the volunteer system also has its shortcomings, and the fundraising for settlement fees and consolation fees requires considerable effort. There are many who are enthusiastic and public-spirited, but there are also many who are rich but unkind and unwilling to contribute a penny. Of the 17 billion spent so far, there are still 4.5 billion in bank loans outstanding, and approximately 3 billion in guarantee money paid by those exempted or postponed from conscription (which must be returned if not approved) must be refunded. Therefore, the Military Service Association's debt of over 7 billion still needs to be jointly raised and made up. Now that military service must be handled again this year, we must solemnly appeal to those with wealth and resources, for the sake of the area and the strong young men, to generously donate and assist in its success. It must be understood that protecting the area and the country is also protecting the lives and property of the general public. With great difficulties ahead, we must work together to overcome them, and no one is allowed to hide away in peace.

### Age of New Recruits

After the meeting, it was rumored that the commander stated that the principle of lottery conscription has been decided. The ages drawn will be from 21 to 23. The method will be indirect lottery, with the Military Service Association setting up a lottery committee to handle the matter, to show solemnity. The proposal by Speaker Pan Gongzhan for new recruits to be trained locally and organized into local self-defense teams was hotly debated and will be submitted to Chairman Chiang for a decision.

### Full Force to Curb Soaring Yarn Prices, Spot Checks on Warehouse Yarn Stock, First Batch of Top Ten Yarn Brands Suspected, Suspension of Auditing Records

Since the Spring Festival in this city, the price surge has been fierce, and the fluctuation of cotton yarn has been leading the way.

In the future, any off-market trading behavior discovered will be arrested and dealt with according to the law.

### Industrial and Commercial Businesses Becoming More Difficult After Sudden Increase in Last Month's Index

Xinyi Factory Proposes Dismissal and Wage Reduction Measures

Since the living index for last month was released the day before yesterday, the industrial and commercial sectors have responded strongly to the index increasing by more than 50% compared to the previous month. According to official predictions, disputes over wage reductions and dismissals in the production industry are likely to increase in the future. It is hoped that labor and management will truly understand and cooperate with each other to avert the current crisis. It is especially hoped that workers can work hard to increase production to compensate for the factory's huge wage expenditure. As for the situation of wage reductions and dismissals, it has already begun to brew in various industries with poor business. For example, Xinyi Hwa Factory, the management has notified the factory's industrial union of two draft austerity measures, asking the workers to choose one of the following: (1) Legally dismiss 120 female workers and pay them dismissal fees. (2) Adopt a rotational work system, with each person working half a month per month. The former is a dismissal, and the latter is a wage reduction, both of which affect the lives of the workers. The factory union has sent a letter to the factory asking it to withdraw its decision.

### Complex Ownership of Unclaimed Aircraft, In Addition to Dahua Airlines, Two Other Parties Came Forward to Claim

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai office of the Civil Aviation Administration previously published a notice in the newspaper seeking claimants for four unclaimed aircraft parked at Longhua Airport. In addition to Cao Shiang, the former head of the aviation group of Dahua Airlines, who had made oral contact, recently other individuals have come forward to formally claim them. One is Kong Guangxiao, a representative of the Kong Consortium, and the other is lawyers Hu Yongsheng and Chen Qingfeng, representatives of the Xinsui Company. Both parties hold relevant documents, claiming that the four aircraft should belong to them. The Shanghai office of the Civil Aviation Administration has sent the letters and documents from both parties to the Nanjing Civil Aviation Administration for review and decision. It is reported that the four aircraft were originally owned by Dahua Company, but because Dahua Company's request for formal establishment was not approved by the government, the four aircraft were mortgaged in various ways to clear debts, and therefore the ownership relationship is very complicated.

### Four District Flour Associations Assist in Northward Transportation Matters

### Innovative Approach to Eradicating Mulberry Locusts Adopting New Method of Hatching Parasitic Wasps, Personnel Sent to Various Places to Work

With silkworm rearing beginning before the Qingming Festival, how to eradicate mulberry locusts and protect the thriving mulberry seedlings to increase silkworm feed is a very important issue. In the past, protecting mulberry seedlings was nothing more than extensively collecting mulberry locust egg masses in mulberry locust breeding areas, but often failed to eradicate them completely afterwards. This year's plan of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is different. The method is to first transport the dug-up mulberry locust egg masses in batches to the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University, place them in a culture room, and hatch them into a parasitic wasp (this wasp is most fond of foraging for mulberry locusts), and then release the parasitic wasps in areas where the mulberry locusts have not been completely eradicated, to eliminate them completely. This method is not only a new initiative of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for the silk industry, but also a pioneering effort in our country to eliminate mulberry locusts. It is learned that the above plan has been fully discussed and matured by representatives of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang governments and the China Silk Company. The estimated cost is 1 billion yuan, with the military bearing half and the rest shared by the Jiangsu and Zhejiang governments. Cai Banghua (an entomologist), the president of the Agricultural College of Zhejiang University, has been hired as the commander-in-chief, and Zhang Zifang, a special commissioner of China Silk, as the deputy commander-in-chief. This week, team members will be sent to Wujiang, Wu Yu and other areas where mulberry locusts are rampant, to work with local government townships and silkworm guidance personnel.

### Rice Tickets Begin Distribution, Allocation Price to be Determined Today, Technical Problems of Distribution Discussed Yesterday

With the repeated efforts of the Municipal Food Allocation Committee and the Civil Affairs Bureau, food allocation in this city has been decided to start on schedule today. At 4 pm yesterday, Ren Xianqun, chairman of the Food Allocation Committee, and Zhang Xiaosong, director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, convened a meeting of more than 60 people, including the heads of districts and chairmen of district people's representative assemblies, at the Municipal Council to discuss the technical problems of allocating grain according to the number of people. It was decided that rice tickets would be distributed first in the three districts of Zhabei, Yangshupu, and Yulin today. Regardless of the size of the household, all registered residents will be allocated one "dou" of rice per person, half of which is from American aid materials and half from the government. The allocated rice has already reached the above three districts yesterday. The rice tickets for Zhabei and Yangshupu districts were also collected by the heads of the two districts yesterday and will be distributed to all citizens in the district this morning. The other districts will also issue them separately in the next two days. As for the allocation price, it will be decided at the food conference hosted by Mayor Wu, President Pan, and Ren Xianqun, chairman of the Food Allocation Committee, at 5 pm today. Gilbert Quiligotti, head of the Sino-American Relief Team, will also attend the meeting. According to sources, the allocation price will be 95% of today's market price. If today's market price is 3 million yuan, then the allocation price will be 2.85 million yuan. The allocation price will not be changed again during this month, regardless of the rise or fall of rice prices. The distributed rice tickets are also stipulated to be valid within this month. After the food conference decides on the allocation price this afternoon, the three designated rice stores will simultaneously start selling the allocated rice.

### Soaring Prices Due to Economic Neurosis: Minister of Economic Affairs Answers Reporters, Denounces Peace Talks as Groundless Rumors

[Central News Agency] Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian recently came to Shanghai on official business and returned to Nanjing by train last night. Before his departure, reporters visited him and he expressed his opinions on the various questions raised by the reporters as follows: (1) Question: What did Mayor Wu discuss with you? Answer: Discussed the Shanghai United Electric Power Company issue. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Shanghai Municipality have no differences in principle on this issue. The remaining technical issues are still subject to further negotiation. As it is my duty, I will do my best to promote the early establishment of the company to solve the electricity problem for Shanghai factories. (2) Question: What are the reasons for the recent sharp rise in prices? Answer: There are many reasons, and I cannot go into details at the moment. However, in terms of the recent sharp rise in prices, one reason is: the influx of idle capital from the Northeast into Shanghai to snap up goods; and two: the fabrication of rumors by unscrupulous people to arouse "economic neurosis" among the general public in order to make profits. Now that most of the idle capital from the Northeast has found its way out, and the current situation has become clearer, no one believes the rumors, and the "economic neurosis" of the general public has therefore improved slightly, and prices can be temporarily stabilized.

Stabilize Currency Value, Dredge Material Resources

(3) Question: What effective measures do you have to stabilize prices? Answer: The fundamental and effective measures are: (1) to reform the currency system and stabilize the currency value; (2) to work hard on construction and promote production; (3) to restore transportation and dredge the flow of material resources; (4) to improve the import system and absorb foreign capital and materials; (5) to strive to quell the chaos and establish peace. The government is either preparing or already implementing these measures, and once they are fully implemented, prices can be completely stabilized. As for the current emergency measures, they are naturally nothing more than managing finance, materials, and prices based on the circumstances, and cracking down on hoarding and speculation, in order to cure "economic neurosis."

Deeply Hope for Long-Term US Aid to China

(4) Question: What are your views on American aid? Answer: Marshall wants to use American aid to stabilize the Chinese economy and give China a breathing space so that China can gradually become self-reliant. We should be grateful and make proper use of this American aid in economic construction, so that it can truly promote production and stabilize prices, in order to live up to the expectations of our American friends. However, the aid needed by China in terms of military affairs, finance, economy, and currency reform is definitely not something that 570 million US dollars can solve. In addition to the emergency aid of 570 million US dollars, there is also a need for large-scale long-term aid. The greater and earlier the American aid to China, the earlier the revival of China will be.

Democracy and Communism are Absolutely Incompatible

(5) Question: What are your observations on the future of the current situation? Answer: The reason why the current situation is so serious can be traced back to the Yalta Conference. The conference allowed the Soviet Union to inherit all the rights of the Tsarist era in the Northeast, which has created the current serious situation. If the Yalta Conference had not allowed the Soviet Union to inherit the Tsarist era's rights of aggression in the Northeast, then the Chinese government would have completely taken over the Northeast long ago, and the current Northeast situation would not have developed. But no matter how serious the Northeast situation is, the government has decided to stand firm to the end, and there is absolutely no possibility of peace talks. Why can't there be any more peace talks? Because democracy and communism are absolutely incompatible, because the Communist bandits benefit from chaos in China and are not conducive to peace in China. If democracy and communism could be compatible, Marshall's various plans for China and Europe would not have been repeatedly attacked by the Soviet Union and the Communist bandits. Since the United States and the Soviet Union cannot reconcile, neither can the Kuomintang and the Communists, so peace talks are absolutely impossible, and peace rumors are absolutely unbelievable.

### Airline Unauthorized Fare Increase Case: Is the Manager Authorized? Is an Investigation Necessary?

### Three Accomplices Arrested in Anti-Drug Operation on Guangzhao Road

[Report from this newspaper] Xu Yang, a criminal patrol officer from the Guanbei Police Precinct, received a tip-off the day before yesterday that a drug dealer, Xu Kewen, was hiding at a certain number on Guangzhao Road in the jurisdiction. Director Shi ordered Officer Xu to go with police officer Hua Yimin and others to arrest accomplices Ma Chongfu, Ma Jifang, and Xu's family member at Xu's residence, but the principal offender Xu Kewen had already fled upon hearing the news. Nine ounces of opium were found in a leather suitcase on the bed. According to the defendants, they had repeatedly brought opium from Suxian County, Anhui to Shanghai, and handed it over to Xu Kewen for sale. The three suspects have now been interrogated and sent to the court for investigation. Xu Kewen, who is still at large, is still being pursued.

Major cities and towns such as Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Shanghai cannot supply electricity smoothly, and they have to control electricity consumption and implement power outages by district in order to maintain the current electricity supply. For example, Nanchang, which was recently reached by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which the reporter has visited, often has to implement power outages by district, and even in areas that are not subject to power outages, the electric lights can only be as dim as a candle.

Before the war, there were more than 100 power plants in Zhejiang Province, including those in various counties and towns. After the war, only 24 or 25 of them have been restored, which shows how difficult the recovery is. However, the Hangzhou Power Plant can

Supply Freely

and has abundant energy. This is indeed an outstanding achievement in the midst of widespread power shortages. According to the person in charge of the Hangzhou Power Plant, "Before the war, the plant was the largest private electrical enterprise in Zhejiang, with two power plants, Zhakou and Genshanmen, with a generating capacity of 17,000 kilowatts. In the winter of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], when the Japanese invaders invaded, the National Army automatically damaged two 7,500-kilowatt generators at the Zhakou Power Plant, along with all the attached equipment. During the period of the Japanese occupation, the plant's business was occupied by the enemy, who used the 2,000-kilowatt generator at Genshanmen to generate electricity, and the stored materials were almost completely looted. More than one-third of the transmission lines in various districts were destroyed or stolen, including more than 5,000 poles and more than 100 miles of wire. In addition, the low-voltage lines in small streets and alleys were mostly replaced with iron wire by the enemy due to the high price of copper at the time, resulting in low voltage and dim lighting. Fortunately, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the plant quickly took over and resumed operations, giving priority to repairing the machinery that had been destroyed during the war, and actively rectifying the high and low voltage lines in various districts to restore the original total generating capacity before the war."

Now the plant's two 7,500-kilowatt generators have been

Fully Repaired

, totaling 15,000 Cairo kilowatts. In terms of energy, this is still far from the current electricity consumption standard in Hangzhou, so they can cope with it easily and smoothly. In Shanghai, which is adjacent to Hangzhou, neon lights are being used sparingly, and power outages are being implemented by district in the Nanshi area of ​​South Shanghai, and electricity consumption by factories is also restricted. However, Hangzhou has not felt this difficulty. When you stroll on every important street at night, the red and green neon lights dazzle your mind, and at the same time, factories, shops, and households in Hangzhou can use electricity continuously. According to people in the electrical industry, there are probably only two cities in the whole country where the electrical industry can cope so easily: Taiwan and Hangzhou, and Taiwan is powered by hydropower, while Hangzhou is powered by thermal power. The reporter became keenly interested in this power plant, which provides light and freedom to the 500,000 citizens of Hangzhou, and went to Zhakou, ten miles away, for a visit.

Zhakou Power Plant

The towering four-story building stands on the banks of the Qiantang River. The plant building covers an area of ​​approximately 120 feet long and 140 feet wide, and is divided into four departments: boiler room, turbine room, power distribution room, and office. There are three vacuum devices, using steam capacity, each capable of extracting 50 pounds of gas per hour. There is also a slate, equipped with various important meters for the turbine, such as steam pressure gauges, vacuum gauges, and temperature gauges. There are three boiler feed water machines, two powered by electricity and one powered by steam, each with a capacity of 100,000 pounds of water per hour. On the left is a flat pipe for the main water inlet pipe, and three true pipes, which are the outlet pipes for each machine. This machine is installed in the bottom layer of the Qiantang River, and the water is returned to the river after being used by the machine. There are five main control panels, manufactured by the British B.T.H factory. All the main switches and meters for generators, transmission lines, and factory transformers are installed on the panels. It is the

Electrical Hub

of the entire plant. There are two turbine generators, each with 7,500 Cairo kilowatts, a steam pressure of 350 pounds per square inch, and a steam temperature of 720 degrees Fahrenheit. The generators are directly connected by the power generation method, which is three-phase, 50 Hz, and 14,000 volts. There are three single-phase transformers, each weighing 500 KVA, with a voltage of 14,000 to 600 volts. The three transformers are interconnected to supply current to all the plant's auxiliary machines. There is an auxiliary machine distribution board, where all switches, meters, heat meters, and wind meters for all the plant's auxiliary machines are centrally managed. The plant's

Main Fuel

is coal, so there is a coal mill that grinds the coal into powder and sends it to the boiler for combustion. Each mill can grind 6,000 pounds of coal per hour. This mill is driven by a motor to feed coal, and the amount is limited by a gate. If all the machines in the plant are fully opened, 3,000 tons of coal are needed. Now the Fuel Supply Committee only supplies 2,000 tons, and when you go to Nanjing to collect it, only 1,400 tons are allocated. The insufficient amount is solved by seeking plant oil. Now the price of coal is 3.9 million yuan per ton, while the price of oil is 8 million yuan per ton. But one ton of oil is equivalent to two tons of coal, and if you burn oil, you can save a lot on labor costs. The reporter asked why not burn all oil? The engineer in charge replied that the machines are limited to burning coal, so the coal and oil are burned together. The plant has about 60 workers in the turbine room power plant, about 68 repair workers, plus more than 100 external technicians, and more than 100 staff members, totaling about 400 people. The highest base salary for workers is 60 yuan and the lowest is 30 yuan. However, the workers in the plant treat the staff as family members and treat the machines and plants as their own homes. They are kind and cordial, so there are no labor disputes. The reporter met a pipe worker in the Bangpu Pumps room who was already gray-haired. He learned that he had been a worker here since the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. In order for both labor and management to develop feelings, live in peace, and overcome difficulties together, all problems can be solved easily as long as everyone is open and honest under the principle that both labor and management are like family members.

The result of the Hangzhou Power Plant's operation is that both income and expenditure can be managed. However, due to

Lack of Meters

, new households cannot be installed, which greatly affects business. These meters need to be purchased from abroad. Based on the current exchange rate, ordering 2,000 units would cost more than 5 billion yuan in national currency. The plant cannot bear such a huge number.

Currently, the most important issues for the Hangzhou Power Plant, in the reporter's personal opinion, are fuel and electricity theft. Fuel shortages can affect power generation, and Hangzhou's light and freedom may be lost, so we are eager for northern coal to open up its channels and be transported south quickly. If that is not possible, we hope that the Pingxiang coal mine can be mined quickly, and even the coal deposits in Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi can absorb idle capital and be encouraged to develop as much as possible, so that the electrical industry, the mother of Southeast industry, may have a greater future.

Electricity Theft

: According to the person in charge of the plant: "Currently, electricity theft accounts for one-eighth of the total power generation. If the stolen electricity is supplied to users, 10,000 households can benefit. These electricity thieves have special powers, and there is really no way to stop them." For the development of public utilities and for the citizens of Hangzhou to always have light and freedom, we have reason to appeal to all sectors of society to impose sanctions!

The allocation of power generated by the Hangzhou Power Plant is approximately 55 percent for industry, 25 percent for households, and 20 percent for stores. Judging from this allocation, Hangzhou's industry is also growing, and we hope that the development of the electrical industry will promote the expansion of industry.

### Taiwu Talks About the Dayong Incident

[Changsha, February 22nd] Xiong Wugong, the speaker of the Dayong County Council, who is recuperating from illness in Changsha, recently explained the Dayong incident, saying: The "May Seventh" incident was originally a conflict between the first and second squadrons of the Dayong police force. When the dispute occurred, Chairman Wang was traveling through Shimen. I coordinated with the county government to mediate the dispute, and the police team was immediately transferred from the city and stationed in Xiyong and Beizhen townships, and the situation calmed down. Later, entrusted by the people of the county to petition, I went to the provincial capital. I visited the chairman during a trip to Shimen and asked him to come to the county to investigate. After arriving in the provincial capital, I spent several months requesting the provincial government to subsidize the county with an insufficient fund of 160 million yuan, and return the borrowed accumulated grain of 15,000 dan. The Cilon Highway was also funded by the provincial government, and construction is scheduled to begin soon. After completing the task, my old illness relapsed. Regarding the position of speaker, I sent a telegram to the Department of Civil Affairs on July 10 of last year requesting my resignation, which was solemnly treated by Director Liu, who forwarded the original telegram to the county for comments, which has not yet been reported to the Department. On September 18, I sent another letter to Director Li asking him to forward it to Deputy Speaker Qu, who should have convened the meeting. I am still recuperating in the province, and rumors of fleeing are unfounded. I have received little education and have served the community for 30 years. I have always known how to value myself and have no desire to be a leader. I am not affiliated with any party, especially not the so-called leader of the B faction.

### Tragedy at Relief Distribution in Yanzhou: Five Refugees Trampled to Death While Receiving Aid

[Report from our newspaper in Yanzhou, February 28th] Jining reported: An unprecedented tragedy occurred here. The Jining Relief Center, organized by the Provincial Department of Social Affairs, has been distributing supplies in place of porridge since before the Lunar New Year, and it has been going smoothly. However, because some of the relief tickets issued were not collected, the supervisory committee members were busy returning to the province to celebrate the Lunar New Year, resulting in a notice that was insufficient, and after returning on February 23, they continued to reissue them. However, the refugees mistakenly believed that it was a second round of relief distribution, and all gathered to receive it. By dawn on February 23, more than 10,000 refugees had gathered at the original site of the Eastern Great Temple Relief Center outside the city. After dawn, the number of people increased, causing the wooden bars outside the temple to break, and six elderly, weak, women, and children near the wooden bars were knocked to the ground and trampled to death. At that time, there were too few policemen to maintain order. After the crowd dispersed, rescue was carried out, but except for Zhu Liu, who was still barely alive, the other five were all dead, and the corpses were scattered, which was extremely tragic. Seeing the tragedy, the person in charge of the Relief Center immediately notified the District Court and the refugees' families to inspect and bury the bodies, and then transported the relief supplies back to the County Government for redistribution at a later date.

Social Services Reader Consultation Legal Clarification

### The Issue of Men and Women Sharing Rooms in Hotels During the Winter Defense Period Lovers' Trysts Require Proof of Identity

Yan Ziyu asks: Recently, the police局 has been rigorously inspecting旅舍 during the winter defense period. Occasionally, some unscrupulous police officers, with extortion in mind, deliberately create difficulties when they encounter men and women in the same room. Now, I have several legal questions and would appreciate your answers: (1) If a room is used for prostitution, are both parties committing a crime, and does the police局 have the right to detain them? (2) Is a lovers' tryst (with both parties having proper identification) prohibited, and is the police局 justified in detaining them and ordering their families to bail them out? Is this practice legal? (3) If a legally married couple (including cohabiting partners) cannot find housing and are staying with relatives, and they meet in a room on a holiday, is this against the law? (4) If a man and a woman are talking intimately in a room without any improper behavior, or if travel companions are in the same room but different beds, can the police局 arbitrarily cause trouble? (5) Can a citizen refuse to be interrogated or detained by a police officer for no crime, and what methods should be used to refuse?

[Answer from Legal Advisor Mr. Tang Mingshi] (1) If a room is used for prostitution and the person renting the room is an unmarried man (i.e., without a spouse), and the prostitute is an official prostitute (with a license), then neither party should be considered guilty. (2) In a lovers' tryst, not only must both parties' identification cards be presented, but proof of their identities (i.e., age, family details, etc.) must also be provided. If they are single men and women, it should not be prohibited. (3) Legally married couples have the right and obligation to live together, so it is naturally not a crime. However, cohabitation should be included in the second question. (4) If a man and a woman are talking intimately or travel companions are in the same room and there is no improper behavior, they are naturally not in violation of the law. (5) In the above situations, the police can investigate according to the police law; if they exceed their authority, they should be held accountable for abuse of power and obstructing freedom. Difficulties may arise because the police's training and education are not perfect and they are not accustomed to using the constitution.

### Postal Q&A

This bureau has received letters of inquiry from (1) Mr. Lu Yanqing of this city and (2) Mr. Zhang Jiping of this city, and we hereby answer the points they raised as follows:

(Answer) (1) For postal items marked "to be delivered by a certain ship," unless the sender has made a claim, regardless of how many times the ship's departure is postponed, it will still be kept for delivery by that ship, except when the postponement is indefinite. For those marked "to be delivered by a certain route," if that route encounters delays, the post office may change it to a faster route. However, for surface and sea mail to Europe and America, if the sender specifically names a certain ship, that ship must be a ship normally used for transporting mail in order to be processed accordingly. If not specifically named, the words "by a certain ship" or "by a certain route" should be added in red ink in the blank space on the cover, with a line underlined below to easily attract attention.

(2) (A) The dates and times for sealing and dispatching airmail to the United States are as follows: every Sunday: 19:00, Tuesday: 12:00 and 19:00, Wednesday: 8:00, Friday: 19:00, and the first and third Wednesdays of each month: 13:00. (Registered airmail is sealed and dispatched one hour earlier.) (B) Packages to the United States can arrive in about twenty days. (C) International reply coupons sent from the United States can be exchanged at the stamp window of this局 for a regular overseas letter stamp.

### Shanghai Military Training Alumni Association Established Wu Tiecheng Attends and Encourages Enthusiastically

[Central News Agency Report] In the years 1935, 1936, and 1937, graduating high school students in Shanghai were concentrated for three months of military training. In these three years, a total of over 15,000 students received this training, including people from all provinces in the country. At that time, Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng served as the Mayor of Shanghai and concurrently as the Commander of the First Military Training Corps and the Honorary Commander of the Second and Third Corps. Now, former officers and students such as Li Xiangqi initiated the establishment of an alumni association, and the inaugural meeting was held yesterday (the 29th) at the Ningbo Township Association. Mr. Wu was invited to attend the meeting and delivered the following speech: "Chairman, fellow students: It has been more than ten years since I last saw you. I served as your commander or honorary commander, and I will always consider it an honor. Today, I am suddenly reunited with you to celebrate the establishment of the alumni association, and I feel especially happy. More than ten years ago, you were still students, inspired by national consciousness, and enthusiastically participated in centralized military training. More than 15,000 students in Shanghai have received military training, including people from all provinces. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, I learned that many students who had received military training participated in the war in various places, and I also know that many students who had received military training sacrificed themselves for the country in the war.

Glorious Historical Deeds

Taking the Battle of Shanghai as an example, our students who remained in Shanghai participated in the 36th Division of Song Xilian and the 87th Division of Wang Jingjiu, resisting foreign invaders and creating brilliant war records. This can be considered the most glorious event in the history of student military training. Looking back now, it still makes people excited. After more than ten years of separation, you have mostly progressed from the era of young students to the prime of life serving the country and society. This era is the most crucial stage in the life process. At this stage of life, whether it is serving society and the country or creating and developing personal careers, the key to success or failure lies in it. There is a close relationship between the country, society, and individual careers. If the country has a future, then we all have a future. You are in the prime of your lives, especially in today's China, a country facing many difficulties and striving for prosperity. The deeper the inspiration and training you receive from this era, the greater the success of your future careers will be. As the saying goes: 'At thirty, one stands firm; at forty, one is no longer perplexed.' You are at a time when you should be making great achievements, and you must deeply understand the era of China today, as this has a great relationship with the success or failure of your future careers. The goal that the Chinese people demand of the revolution is to build an independent, democratic, free, prosperous, and happy Three Principles of the People's country. The Chinese Kuomintang and the people of the whole country have been striving in this correct direction in the revolutionary movement for more than fifty years. Past history tells us that no matter what difficulties and setbacks we encounter, we can overcome them with the spirit of revolution. If we encounter difficulties and setbacks, and we are bewildered, depressed, or颓唐消沉, then we are not worthy of being called revolutionary party members, nor are we patriotic youth who shoulder the great mission of the era, and at the same time, we cannot save the country from danger.

Now China is facing a serious juncture in history. In other words, the Chinese revolutionary movement is approaching a stage close to success, but it has suffered a major blow, which is the all-out rebellion of the Communist Party. The Chinese people have undergone eight years of long-term resistance to Japan, endured the greatest disaster, and need a peaceful and unified country after victory, so that the people can recuperate and the government can concentrate its strength on復興建設. In order to seize power and overturn the government, the Chinese Communist Party has raised troops in rebellion and destroyed China's peace and unity. In order to protect the country's unity and peace, the government has the responsibility to suppress the rebellion, so we must clearly recognize that suppressing the rebellion is by no means a party struggle.

Two Roads of Life and Death

The Chinese people, especially the educated youth of China, must clearly understand the path they take at this critical juncture of national governance, chaos, prosperity, and decline. Now China only has two roads, the road to life is the great road of the Three Principles of the People to save the country and build the country, and the road to death is the road taken by the scourge of the country and people, the bandit-like Communists. If we take the wrong path, China will become part of a totalitarian political country, just like the situation of the vassal states of Eastern Europe today. There is no, nor should there be, a third road. The so-called middle road is actually a徘徊徬徨 side road, that is, the road to waiting for death. Moreover, some people who advocate the middle road are invisibly being used by the Communist Party to divide and dismember the revolutionary forces of China without realizing it.

China's revolution,復興建設, does not allow for further delay. Looking back at the 37 years since the founding of the Republic of China, China has missed the best opportunities for revival and construction twice: First, if it were not for the forces of warlords and feudal remnants such as Yuan Shikai, which caused destruction of the law and chaos and years of civil war, hindering China's peaceful reunification and construction, then China's democratic politics would have embarked on the right track earlier; Second, after the success of the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in 1926, which destroyed the forces of warlords, bureaucrats, and feudal remnants, promoting China's unity, China entered a new氣運. If it were not for the Communist Party occupying Jiangxi, raising troops in rebellion, and the invasion of Japanese imperialism, which triggered eight years of long-term resistance to Japan, China's construction to remove the old and布新 could have laid its foundation.

Good Opportunity for Revival

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it should have been China's third opportunity for revival and construction. The abolition of unequal treaties, the increase in international status, and the eagerness of the government and the people to seek governance were truly rare opportunities to turn the tide of the nation. The Communists understood that the existence of this opportunity was very unfavorable to their intentions and attempts, so they did everything possible to destroy peace and unity, and even launched a full-scale rebellion, which is China's misfortune and the people's misfortune.

The Chinese people must concentrate their strength, seize this good opportunity for national revival and construction, and not make the same mistake again and again, and let it be destroyed again and lost. We must not only strive for today, but also strive for tomorrow. In other words, we must not only take care of the present, but also take care of the future. China's hope lies in the patriotic youth of China today. We must call on the educated youth to unite under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the only leader of China today, to enrich the revolutionary forces, seize this good opportunity for revival and construction, suppress the rebellion and achieve national peace and unity as soon as possible, and consolidate the foundation of democracy and freedom; in this way can we ensure the stability of people's livelihoods and national construction. You are all at a time when you are in the prime of your life and are the backbone of all sectors of society. You should first unite, call on the youth of the whole country, participate in the work of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, and complete the mission of the national revolution. We must always be vigilant together and encourage each other." After Mr. Wu finished his speech, the general assembly began to discuss the charter and passed the appointment of 31 directors, including Li Xiangqi, Ge Mingda, Zhang Xinyu, Zhu Zhenguo, and Wu Shichang, and nine supervisors, including Tao Yishan and Li Zixiang. Finally, after reading a telegram of respect to the chairman, the meeting adjourned. The original telegram is as follows: "Chairman Chiang, may you be well. Retracing the history of your leadership of the revolution and the control of the nation's機, beginning with the Northern Expedition, guided by the War of Resistance, leading the marshals and winning victories. Despite the difficulties of the country's progress, we all look up to your宏濟, rescuing the people from the depths of suffering, achieving庆来苏. Now that the suppression of the rebellion is in full swing, the安宁 remains to be achieved. These remaining bandits, how can they be allowed to跳梁? The people of the whole country are deeply indignant!

### Adjustment of Capital for Industrial, Mining, and Transportation Enterprises Extended to the End of March

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Central Government previously stipulated methods for revaluing fixed assets and adjusting capital for industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises. It was stipulated that enterprises in these sectors, when facing one of the following situations, could revalue their existing fixed assets to adjust their capital: (1) When price fluctuations cause existing capital to be insufficient for operational turnover, requiring the issuance of new shares; (2) When expanding business operations requires the issuance of new shares; (3) When merging with other organizations requires a capital readjustment. The above revaluation and capital increase were limited to one instance only and were originally scheduled to be completed within the 36th year. The Municipal Social Bureau has now been ordered to extend the deadline to the end of March of this year.

The amount purchased by the Yarn Control Bureau is approximately 150,000 piculs.

### The Rebirth and Support of Taiwanese Coal

Exploration in New Mining Areas

Taiwan's coalfields are located predominantly in the northern region, stretching from Keelung to the Daan River in Hsinchu County, spanning a north-south line of 160 kilometers. Although the area is quite extensive, the geological strata are extremely unstable, and the trends are inconsistent. The thickness of each layer is at most only about three feet, with an average thickness of only about one and a half feet. Each layer is also separated by rock strata of several tens of meters. These natural limitations explain the difficulty of mining operations. Moreover, the mining areas are extremely scattered. The largest mine can only produce 8,000 metric tons per month, while the smallest produces only 30 to 50 tons per month, appearing exceptionally small compared to those in Northeast and North China. Consequently, while the province produces over 100,000 tons of coal per month, there are over two hundred mining units. Under these circumstances, fully adopting modern mechanized production methods is naturally impossible. The coal mining area, from the Japanese occupation period to the present, is concentrated in the northern counties of Taiwan (including Keelung and Ruifang). Many coalfields have been explored for a century, with horizontal pits reaching depths of over 1,000 meters and inclined shafts extending over 3,000 meters. Due to the small scale and the inability to utilize mechanical equipment, the production of these old pits is inevitably declining. Therefore, the Department of Reconstruction has allocated funds to cooperate with the Geological Research Institute in exploring the Hsinchu mining area, and to conduct exploratory production simultaneously. However, coal mine development cannot be achieved in the short term, and it is expected to take at least a year before supplies can be obtained from the new mines. The current policy for coal mines should be a two-pronged approach: developing new mines while actively increasing production in existing ones.

Therefore, the task of actively producing in existing mines and supporting mine owners becomes extremely important. This task is fully undertaken by the Coal Adjustment Committee, which is directly under the Provincial Government. Its responsibilities include coordinating fuel control policies, handling unified purchase and sales operations, and incorporating support into adjustment work. The reporter interviewed the person in charge of the Committee, inquiring about production support issues. According to them, in addition to regulating supply and demand, the Committee provides as much protection and assistance as possible to small mine operators. Its main business related to increasing production can be divided into three categories:

(1) Coal Price Adjustment: Coal prices can be divided into domestic sales and export sales. The domestic sales price is the purchase price, which is increased by NT$200 per ton (this NT$200 is for management fees). The purchase price is determined based on the actual cost of the operators, plus 30% to 40% profit. The basis for each price adjustment is based as much as possible on the opinions of the Coal Mining Association. The latest purchase price has been increased to NT$11,000 per ton for special-grade coal seams. Export prices are determined entirely by the Shanghai Fuel Control Committee. All profits from export coal, after the Coal Committee extracts 5% for management fees, are distributed to coal mine operators. This measure has been implemented since December of last year.

(2) Supply of Equipment: The Committee has also made considerable efforts in this regard. The most lacking material in Taiwan's coal mines is smokeless safety explosives. In addition, mechanical equipment, boilers, and steel rails are also urgently needed. At the end of last year, the Committee borrowed US$100,000 in foreign exchange from the Central Bank to purchase explosives, which can be purchased this spring and used for the whole year, lacking little else. Steel cables and steel rails are also being acquired and distributed to private coal mines at reasonable prices, so as not to hinder production due to lack of equipment. (To be continued)

### A Review of the Issue of Collaboration between Private Sector and Scientific Engineering

— Zhang Jiyan

After reading Mr. Lu Yudao's article "Collaboration between Private Sector and Scientific Engineering" in the Ta Kung Pao on January 26th, I cannot help but deeply admire Mr. Lu's foresight and earnest words, which aroused sympathetic resonance and prompted a response.

Under the current situation of widespread war and suffering, scientific workers have not received active encouragement from the government. In the current period of emphasis on military affairs, there is naturally even less hope for improvement in the short term. Promoting collaboration between the private sector and scientific engineering at this time is indeed the only way out of the frustration of scientific workers in the country today.

How can we promote collaboration between the private sector and scientific engineering? The author will only briefly discuss some initial views, hoping to attract greater ideas and encourage scientific experts to discuss and offer more concrete and brilliant opinions together. Popularize scientific knowledge among the public.

Popularize scientific knowledge among the public.

Although today's public in the country is no longer the same as it was thirty years ago, with industrials trained in science being commonplace, this is only a part of the larger cities. The public in the vast regions of the country still knows nothing about science. This is certainly due to the lack of universal education, but popularizing scientific knowledge among the public is undoubtedly more difficult than simply eliminating illiteracy and promoting literacy in universal education. At least students above the secondary school level can engage in scientific research. Therefore, scientific workers and the public still seem to be separated by a chasm. There are still very few scientific publications that are suitable for the general public to read; some are only readable by specialized scientists. It can be seen that the majority of the public does not even know that there is such a thing as science. To promote collaboration between the private sector and scientific engineering, we scientific workers must approach the public and delve into the grassroots, using accessible promotional materials to make the public recognize and become interested in scientific knowledge.

Promote the industrial sector's understanding of science.

Since the beginning of the atomic age, the distance on Earth has been shortened, and the concept of a global village is becoming increasingly close. The superiority and inferiority of international competition in industry and commerce are also becoming increasingly obvious. If China's industrial products do not seek improvement through scientific methods, and if the cost of labor and raw materials cannot be compared with those of others, not only will it be impossible to compete with foreign goods in the future, but there is simply the danger of being eliminated and unable to exist. Currently, apart from a few industrial sectors in larger cities that have scientifically trained talents, the understanding of using scientific methods to improve industrial production is still not widespread throughout the entire industrial sector. Therefore, when the government cannot encourage and support private research, domestic scientific workers should still contribute their knowledge to the industrial sector, arousing the industrial sector's widespread understanding of science, and then further continue research work, so that scientists and the industrial sector can develop close cooperation.

Lead the industrial sector to invest in scientific research.

Due to inflation, there is an overabundance of idle funds in the market, leading to economic instability. Conversely, investment in industrial production is only decreasing. This is also because there are many problems with labor and raw materials in the industrial sector, resulting in high production costs and the inability to make profits. Therefore, there is little interest in investment. However, if this continues unabated, it will be very dangerous for the future of China's industry. To solve this problem, it is necessary to increase production and reduce costs, which relies on scientific research and invention. There is no shortage of scientific geniuses and inventors in the country, nor is there a shortage of raw materials. It is just that research and invention require considerable time and economic resources. If the industrial sector takes a long-term view and can jointly invest in scientific research work, like foreign countries, and gather the huge capital of industrial capitalists to establish large-scale scientific research laboratories, it is believed that the achievements of future inventions will definitely have considerable value in industry. Then the future of China's industry and the future of the country's scientific development will be very hopeful.

Establish laboratories as soon as possible.

There are many well-known scientific organizations in the country, among which the China Science Society, the Chinese Society for Arts and Sciences, and the Chinese Society of Natural Sciences have long histories and gather excellent scientific experts in the country. However, the entire group rarely has contact with private industrial sectors in peacetime. Therefore, under economic constraints, not only can most scientific experts not have private research rooms like foreign scientists, but even wanting to establish several experimental research rooms by the group is still far from success due to funding and other issues. Therefore, under the slogan of promoting collaboration between the private sector and scientific engineering, on the one hand, it is hoped that scientific organizations with many scientific experts will have closer contact with private industrial organizations in the future. On the other hand, it is hoped that private industrial sectors with a long-term view will cooperate with the research plans of scientific organizations that have demonstrated existing achievements and existing scientific experts, providing capital and establishing various research laboratories as soon as possible.

In short, when the country's financial resources cannot focus on scientific research in the near future, only in this way can domestic scientific workers avoid sighing "uselessness" and can the private industrial sector have hope of opening up new avenues in the future crisis. Science and industry are closely related and mutually dependent. Let us all quickly call for the slogan of "collaboration between the private sector and scientific engineering" and work together to make it a reality!

### The Water Tower at Sun Moon Lake

### Unexpected Scientific Discoveries

— Ye Lei

Saccharin

C. Fahlberg worked in the laboratory for a whole day. He was hungry and, without washing his hands, hurriedly picked up a piece of bread and ate it. Strangely, the bread he ate at that time was particularly sweet compared to what he usually ate. Because he was eager to go back to his experiment, he ate quickly and didn't pay attention while eating.

After finishing the bread, he poured a glass of water to drink. At this time, he saw that his hands were very dirty. Then he recalled the special sweetness he had just tasted and tasted his own hands and the things he had picked up while eating the bread. He knew that the sweetness came from his dirty hands, and that the dirt on his hands was from being stained with chemicals during the experiment. So he immediately checked the chemicals he had used during the experiment and, as a result, discovered a very sweet new substance called "saccharin."

Bakelite

One night, in Dr. L. Baekeland's laboratory, a pair of lazy cats, wanting to steal food, jumped onto the medicine shelf and knocked over a bottle of formalin solution. The cat was frightened and ran away. Underneath the bottle of formalin solution, there happened to be a mousetrap with fragrant cheese inside to lure mice. The formalin solution poured on top of it immediately caused a change, producing a hard new substance.

The next morning, Dr. Baekeland saw this new substance and was very surprised. After checking, he realized that it was formed by the combination of the formalin solution and the cheese. He thought that such a hard substance could definitely be used to manufacture daily necessities, which aroused the motivation for research, and as a result, he invented "Bakelite."

Stainless Steel

During World War I, H. Brearley wanted to forge a very hard steel to manufacture guns. He repeatedly mixed chromium and steel and put them into the furnace for forging experiments. However, the chromium steel he forged was not very hard. At that time, he didn't care and threw it away.

Later, one day, his assistant was cleaning up the accumulated garbage and suddenly saw some shiny things mixed in the pile of garbage. He picked them up and saw that they were the chromium steel that had been discarded before. He thought that steel would normally rust in such a humid pile of garbage, but the chromium steel hadn't rusted, so mixing chromium into the steel could definitely prevent rusting. Therefore, he focused on research and invented "stainless steel."

Penicillin

Nineteen years ago, Professor Alexander Fleming was cultivating grape-like cocci when suddenly a small spore of Penicillium flew in from the window and landed in a petri dish. Perhaps because Penicillium was common, Professor Fleming didn't remove it at the time. Later, this small spore slowly grew into a wheel-shaped Penicillium and secreted a magical new substance that killed or conquered nearby grape-like cocci, rendering them immobile.

When Professor Fleming discovered this new substance, he was very excited. He put the pair of Penicillium in broth and cultivated them, and the results proved that the magical new substance it secreted did have bactericidal effects. So he continued to study it together with many scholars. After more than ten years, in 1940, Aorauam and others refined it and dedicated it to medical use, saving countless patients. This new drug is called "Penicillin."

Some scientific inventions are accidental, which is indeed the inventor's luck. However, the fact that inventors can seize this luck and focus on research is due to their usual research skills. It is accidental, but not accidental.

### The Sun Moon Lake Hydroelectric Power Plant in Taiwan

— H.K. Zhou

When a winding road like a yellow snake stretches all the way from the mountainside into the clouds, and even the car is panting as it climbs, you will definitely think you have reached a monotonous and lonely mountaintop. But what unfolds before you is a scene of beautiful lakes and mountains—Sun Moon Lake. Can you imagine that on this mountain at an altitude of 745 meters, there is such a beautiful "West Lake"?

Sun Moon Lake, unlike West Lake, does not only have beautiful scenery, like a classical Chinese beauty; nor does it only have water power, like Niagara Falls in the United States, like an 18th-century classical scientist. It has both, just like a forward-moving woman of the new era. Sun Moon Lake is neither a completely natural lake nor a completely artificial lake. It is a combination of both. It was discovered by a mountain tribe called the Bu Ji 273 years ago. At that time, the deepest part of the lake was only 27 meters. The perimeter was 24 kilometers. Later, the Japanese discovered that its terrain could be used to generate electricity. So they started constructing water conservancy projects, building dikes in the surrounding mountain depressions, and diverting water from the surrounding mountains into the lake. As a result, the entire valley became a lake, and the water level rose by 70 meters. The perimeter expanded to 30 kilometers, and many mountain peaks were submerged in the tide. Therefore, the Daguan Power Plant was built 19 kilometers from Sun Moon Lake. Five large water pipes were used to guide the water down from Sun Moon Lake, using the water's potential energy to drive five huge generators capable of generating more than 20,000 kilowatts of electricity. The water used by the Daguan Power Plant was then used for electricity generation a second time, and the Jugong Power Plant was built in Shuilikeng, 8 kilometers from Daguan, where the terrain is even lower. The water was used to generate electricity through two large water pipes. The electricity generated by the two plants was then combined and distributed to all parts of Taiwan.

Sun Moon Lake's water conservancy equipment is very complete, and the water level can be adjusted freely without being affected by rainfall. The water level can be raised or lowered by as much as 50 meters. The water level is highest in February and lowest in April and May, so electricity can be generated all year round. The generators and outlets also have special equipment. Automatic regulators are installed to ensure that the voltage and current are very uniform. According to the plant, it can now generate about 160,000 kilowatts of electricity. There is still a surplus for use in Taiwan Province. After the Kaohsiung Aluminum Plant recently started operations, or

Sitting on a train in Taiwan and looking out the window, you can see the high-voltage power lines of the large-scale project, which have a voltage of more than 40,000 volts! (Picture broadcast in this issue)

### The Magnificence of the Wujie Sluice Gate

### A Record of Simple Scientific Experiments at Home

— Liu Suisheng

After sunset, as the lights were lit, I sat with my family around the stove, enjoying the happiness of family life. When we were done, we engaged in scientific experiments for recreation.

At that time, I had a cigarette in my hand, and white smoke swirled, blowing directly above the stove. My son asked why, and my concubine replied that the air above the stove rises when heated, and cold air flies in to fill the space. For example, when the weather suddenly gets hot, a cool breeze follows. This experiment clearly demonstrates the cause of wind.

My son was playing with hot water, his hands dripping wet. I said: Come! Move your hand closer to the stove fire. At the same time, I ordered my daughter to take a paper fan and wave it at his hand, blowing the warm air from the stove onto his hand. My son said: "Before my hand dries, I feel cool; after it dries, I feel warm." I said: "This experiment shows that breathing or sweating can keep the body cool."

My son was playing with sand, with two small lead buckets. One was filled with sand, and the other with water. They were placed on the stove and heated to the same temperature, then moved to the table. I ordered my daughter to measure the temperature from time to time, and she said that the temperature dropped faster with the sand. My wife asked me with a smile, "What does this show?" I said, "Sand represents the continent, and water represents the ocean. This shows that the continental climate changes rapidly, and the oceanic climate is relatively mild."

My wife took scissors and cut out two paper figures. I ordered my daughter to paint one paper figure entirely with ink, and leave the other unpainted. Then I separately applied candle oil to the hands of the two paper figures, and positioned them on opposite sides of a candle flame. After a while, the flag in the hand of the black figure fell first. This clearly shows that black absorbs heat more easily, so dark-colored clothing is suitable for winter, and white is suitable for summer.

My son took ice water in an aluminum cup. I added table salt and asked him to stir it with chopsticks. Then I ordered my daughter to insert a thermometer. Before long, dew appeared on the outside of the cup, and the measured temperature was the dew point, which also indicates when rain and dew appear.

My daughter took a large glass bottle and threw burning pieces of paper into it, quickly sealing it with a wooden stopper with a bamboo tube. Blowing air in or sucking air out caused the smoke to rise or sink. This is because increasing or decreasing the pressure causes the smoke to rise or sink. Therefore, by observing the horizontal or vertical flight of cooking smoke, we can know whether a storm is coming.

The simple experiments on meteorology were temporarily suspended. My daughter suddenly said, "Our teacher said that scientific experiments should be done in a science museum."

I said, "Natural science takes matter as its object; people cannot live apart from matter, so scientific experiment materials are available anytime and anywhere, not limited to science museums. If science education is only a decoration for schools and cannot deeply penetrate the people, this is why I worry about the future of Chinese science."

After the experiments were finished, we smiled at each other and, after putting away the utensils, went to bed. The next day, I picked up my pen and wrote "A Record of Simple Scientific Experiments at Home."

### On "Professional Oppositionists"

— Jing Wen

The term "intellectual" seems to have gained considerable importance recently. In Ambassador Stuart's message to the Chinese people, he stated, "If Chinese intellectuals can form a progressive group to stimulate government decision-making, peace can be enhanced."

Ambassador Stuart's few words, and the main point of his entire speech, are nothing more than an extension of General Marshall's declaration when he left China the year before, because General Marshall also indicated at the time that China's future depended on the cooperation between intellectuals and the government. General Marshall seemed to have added the adjective "enlightened and progressive" before "intellectuals."

However, this time Ambassador Stuart's remarks seem to go a step further, indicating that there are many gaps between the current government and intellectuals, which led to a defense by the new Director, Xian Guang, whose main point was that although Ambassador Stuart deeply understands the situation of my country's educational circles, it is too much to say that the government and intellectuals cannot cooperate. He also pointed out that the majority of Chinese intellectuals cooperate with the government, and although there are occasional people who cannot express sympathy for the government's measures, every country has "professional oppositionists," which cannot prove that Chinese intellectuals do not cooperate with the government.

The fact that Chinese intellectuals are receiving such attention at home and abroad may inevitably make them feel somewhat flattered. This is because Chinese intellectuals are currently in a period of unprecedented suffering in both material and spiritual life, and now they are actually being watched by friendly countries and valued by the government, which believes that China's future destiny must be entrusted to them. Isn't this surprising to them?

However, I personally have always said that the intellectuals of a country, no matter how despised by society in a certain era, will ultimately be indispensable. This is not to boast for intellectuals. Just look at even in countries that advocate class dictatorship, who holds the initial and final leadership? Can it escape the hands of intellectuals? Classifying people by economic life, perhaps every individual can be attributed to a certain class, but intellectuals are different.

Intellectuals may have so-called class consciousness, but in reality, it is not important, because as soon as power is in hand, the power of knowledge will outweigh class consciousness. The Soviet Union is an example. The Soviet Union is a country that claims to be a proletarian revolution, but the people who lead this revolution are actually a small number of intellectuals. Even the entire theory of proletarian revolution comes from the fantasies of a small number of intellectuals. Can you believe that Russian peasants who had just been liberated from serfdom would have any proletarian revolutionary consciousness? And today, all actions of the Soviet Union are by no means to protect the interests of some "proletarian motherland," but exactly like the leading intellectuals of other countries, only considering ordinary national interests.

In my opinion, there is only a distinction between intellectuals in power and intellectuals out of power. Intellectuals in power are those who cooperate with the government, while those out of power are those whom George Bernard Shaw called "professional oppositionists." If my observation is correct, then the Chinese intellectuals whom some American public opinion criticizes for still having gaps with the government only refer to that group of "professional oppositionists."

However, to unite all intellectuals into "one front" is not only impossible, but also unnecessary. To be honest, the distinction between so-called democracy and undemocracy lies in how much tolerance a government has for "professional oppositionists," and not in expanding the government's foundation to accommodate all intellectuals.

For example, take the United States. The reason why the United States is called a democratic country is not because the foundation of the American government is built on a unified front of American intellectuals, but because the American government still has the tolerance to accommodate people like Wallace criticizing the government. However, for the American Communist Party, although the American government is democratic, its attitude of tolerance is limited. But this does not detract from the democratic spirit of American intellectuals in power. Why? Because American intellectuals in power know very well that if they switched places with the American Communist Party, even people like Wallace would probably have no room to exist.

The current problem of Chinese intellectuals is not how to bring all the "professional oppositionists" out of power into power, but whether there is tolerance for "professional oppositionists." And this, I am afraid, is precisely what some American public opinion is demanding of China.

### Children's Railway

— Tong

According to the "Moscow News", the first children's railway in the Transcarpathian Mountains was inaugurated in Fanxu Zhendem, all the people from young drivers to stationmasters are composed of school-age children in the fourth to tenth grades. These children are progressing extremely fast in school. The teachers think they are satisfied before allowing them to participate in the children's railway work in their spare time. A small passenger train was built specifically for this railway.

### Strange

— Fang Pu

During the Hu Tianqi years, in the hot sixth month, it snowed in the city of Wuqing County, Zhili, and the color of the clouds was scarlet red. The snow stopped after half an hour. At that time, the ministers of the court submitted a memorial, thinking that this was an omen of chaos in the world, and asked the emperor to love the people and reform politics to save the great calamity.

During the Xianfeng years of the Qing Dynasty, a family in Fengtian Jin County who was marrying a bride was taking the bridal sedan back. The journey was long, and they encountered heavy snow on the way, so they hid in an ancient temple in a nearby desolate mountain to rest temporarily. Who knew that the snow was getting heavier and heavier, blocking the way out of the mountains. These people got lost and could not get out. It took more than ten days for the snow to melt and the road to open. The men and women searched for them everywhere. A month later, they were found in this ancient temple. More than seventy people, including the bride and groom, musicians, and guests who welcomed and sent them off, had all starved to death inside. County magistrate Chen Chunxu went to examine the bodies in person and shed tears for them.

In the winter of the twentieth year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty, a boat in Taihu Lake was frozen in the center of the lake by ice and snow and could not move. After about a month, the ice melted and the boat floated downstream, where it was discovered that everyone in the boat had starved to death, but there were still more than two stones of white rice left in the boat. It turned out that the fire was gone, so even though there was rice, they could not cook.

In the era of the Russian Empire, Siberia was the place where political prisoners were exiled, and its wind and snow were world-famous. A prison for political prisoners was built a bit low. In a certain year in the nineteenth century, there was heavy snow in Siberia, and it snowed for two days in a row. The snow on the ground was already five or six feet thick. In the evening, the sky cleared up, and everyone was relieved, thinking that it would be fine, but at night, the snow fell again, and it was even heavier than during the day. Overnight, the depth of the snow exceeded the roof of the low prison. The entire prison was deeply buried in the snow. More than 100 prisoners and managers all froze to death in their sleep. The next day, the prison was "missing." The local authorities were unable to visit due to the difficulties caused by the heavy snow. It was not until the snow began to melt and the roof of the prison was exposed that the mystery came to light. Later, the prison was dismantled, and the local authorities erected a stone tablet on the original site in memory of this event, engraved with the words "Snow Tomb."

In the winter of 1923, Oslo, the capital of Norway, experienced unprecedented heavy snow. The city accumulated 30 million tons of snow. More than 100,000 people were mobilized (almost all men over the age of fifteen in the city) to remove the snow, and it took more than forty days to clear it. During the heavy snow, the city's water pipes were all crushed by the snow, and the citizens boiled the snow in front of their doors to drink as tea. Food was also very scarce. Food from outside could not be transported in due to traffic disruption. The government borrowed several planes from the UK loaded with dry food and dropped it from the air in a public square in the city, which was distributed by the government to the common people.

### Yuan Hanyun Twenty Years Ago

— Banmeng Laoren

In the winter of the seventh year of the Republic of China, the great writer Yuan Hanyun and I met in Beidu, and we became acquainted at first sight. We talked about literature and characters, and the feeling was very pleasant. One day, Yuan prepared wine and invited me to drink. Bu Linwu, Zhu Xiaqing, and Xu Lingxiao were all present. Hanyun wore a jade-colored long robe, held a rosary in his hand, and his face was as white as jade. He was a suave and elegant gentleman. After that, he spread paper on the edge of the bed and made a union, writing in the air. His pen did not stop, and each character was powerful and vigorous, which was truly beyond the reach of others.

Halfway through the wine, Hanyun took out two volumes of Song Dynasty fish seal collections of poems and asked everyone to write poems. I was assigned the rhyme "snow" and immediately improvised: "The phoenix luo screen flies like jade layers, the shark silk is brocade and jade congealing spring snow, the bright red powder halo seems to enter the gods, the yellow clouds silk cover the girl's blood; although the remnants of the millennium are not edible, the paper light is dazzling and the words are fragrant, when brushing flowers late at night and chanting, it is like hearing the stocks diligently recognize the voice." After writing it on the collection, there were many titles at the time. The seal at the beginning of the collection said "Gao Erzi." I said to Hanyun, you are the prince, the seal is almost teasing, what is the meaning? Hanyun then took out his own poem and said: "Wearing fine cotton for the first time is better than self-sufficiency, the ancient wall is desolate and a railing relies on the land, the flying tai liquid heart has no stay, the clouds rise from the demonic cliff and the dream wants to win. Occasionally hearing distant flutes in distant forests, alone in the spiritual room turning bright lights, I especially pity the high places with more wind and rain, do not reach the top floor of the Qiong Building." The last couplet indicated his intention not to become emperor, using his strength to persuade his father but to no avail, and his eldest brother, one force advocated that nothing should be carried out safely, claiming that the crown prince was firmly in hand, because Hanyun wrote poems to advise, and advocated opposition, the hatred became deeper, almost playing out the story of Chen Siwang boiling beans and burning stalks, relying on this seal, showing consistency, and then he got the whole body, at that time, outsiders could not deeply understand the inside story.

Hanyun's calligraphy was especially outstanding, thin and hard, able to melt the ancient seal into a furnace and smelt it. He once sent me a letter on calligraphy, which said: "Calligraphy begins with seal learning, and those who learn calligraphy must begin with seal characters. The seal script is upright in style and meticulous in white, and after practicing it, attack others, so as to avoid the disease of weak and vulgar desolation. After the seal method is exhausted, then the official script will be used to contain it. When learning the official script, you should take the steles of the Western Han Dynasty. After the Eastern Migration, more attention is paid to the side charm, and the ancient meaning is gradually sparse. Advance to participate in the ancient grass, explore the source of the book to the extreme of the vertical and horizontal turning potential, and establish the foundation of the book, and the book will be completed with the six dynasties of calligraphy. The book of the Six Dynasties, especially the Northern Wei inscriptions, see the official posture and seal bones, which is regarded as the ancestral law of Kai, if the book of Zhong Wang, it is truly perfect, but the Kaishu passed down to the world is mostly seen in posts, posts are hooks and imitations, even if there is a good job, it is difficult to complete its spirit, steles are written on stone, you must keep its original, there is no slight loss, so take the truth of the Six Dynasties, abandon the false of Zhong Wang. The Sui and Tang inscriptions are well-constructed, and it is good to browse through them. The books of the Song and Yuan people are becoming more and more charming, with sharpness, not suitable for human stone, and the ink version is still worth seeing. The Ming people are even more exposed, and there are occasional teams of goblins. The Qing scholars were trapped in the posts and could not be surpassed, so the books were mostly confined and narrow. However, this is just a general statement, if there are strange and prominent scholars who are not confused by vulgar currents, peep into the hall of the ancients and become a family of their own, there are still people in the generation. Taking the true soul of the seal and official script and competing with Xijing, Daozhou is a thousand years old. After the Tang Dynasty, the books of famous families can be used for participation and play, but it is not enough to use as a teacher. People in the world abandon the fundamentals and pursue the ends, or imitate the Sanxi Hall, or imitate the Tanxi Shi'an generation, and if they get a slight resemblance, they will be self-proclaimed calligraphers, if they know the law of Dongpo Shangu Songxue Xianggong and other families, they will be more arrogant and proud of the high ancients, those who seek to know the Six Dynasties are already few, let alone the Three Dynasties Qin and Han. The ancient law has fallen, what else can be said!" In the Qing Dynasty, he only admired He Zizhen, not without seeing. After several years of separation, the old man exhausted his energy, and not long after, he heard that he had died at sea, and the ink left behind was rarely seen, which is a pity.

When the Japanese pirates were rampant, I took refuge in Shanghai. Occasionally, I and my old friend Jingzhai, in the Lengchou stall, obtained two volumes of Hanyun's diary. The printing was exquisite, the calligraphy was vigorous, and in addition to poetry and various styles, he was especially good at writing couplets, which was truly an excellent book. The association also involved Xiangcheng Dangguo, such as the rising sun, Yuan's silver coins, the credit was clear, the poor countryside was widely circulated, the people's hearts gradually felt stable, it is a pity that the emperor's desires suddenly expanded, the great cause collapsed, and the people were even more uneasy. The ancients said that all laws are only in the mind, and the turn of one mind can be seen immediately, and the relationship is truly small.

### Four Poems on Spring Rain

— Shi Shufan

It just fell from the sky, and it is more sorrowful than in the old days, the three years of disturbance are still dangerous, and tonight the anger thunders: the bronze horse is spring neighing on the grass outside the pass, the painted eaves of the tile are peeling with taro ash, and for the time being, the land is large and far from the war, and there is hunger and cold on all sides.

The rain is intertwined and the collapsed plain is not willing to clear up, looking at the sky is also as depressed as a person, I pity the Chancellor of the sea labor, and I still regret that the reason is less in harmony with the ministers! Dare to say that the party is in the old age? Mihuizhong is not in the new discussion. I look at the border moon with anger and anger, and the unconscious common people are the most true.

Red lights spray fog all over Kyushu, and I will recognize the wolf star as my father Kun, it is futile to be chaotic and punish the white horse, and I will not forgive Zhu Wen when I take advantage of the danger; the sons are occupying the southeast emperor, and only one or two villages are left with chickens and dogs.

It is expected that the violent gas will show the barbaric punishment, and the generation of loyalty and adultery will be recorded in the book. It is necessary to divert the flow to the dirty officials, and also need to taste the courage to train new soldiers! The peeping of people is crowded, and the hall is turning around, and the clothes and hats of the dream are shocking every night; it is better to be a slight birth and worry about the unpredictable, and there will be no more wild and clear weeds in the mountains.

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 11: Full of Doubts, Eighty-Four

Zhu Zhai thought that the general Kunling and the people in the military and political circles were close, and the only ones who were well-known were Qiwan and Manying, and Lanfen. Lanfen has recently been ill and has gone to the hospital. Manying offended people because of her bad luck and went to Qingdao. Now only Qiwan and Miao Zhongjie are together. Outsiders are talking about it. This famous actress is mostly referring to Qiwan. After get off work that day, I took the newspaper and came to Qiwan's house. I asked the maid, Xiao Wangma, at the door, and she said that Qiwan had just returned not long ago and was taking a nap in the bedroom. When Zhu Zhai heard that she was sleeping, he didn't dare to go in, so he asked outside and asked Xiao Wangma about Qiwan's most recent situation. Xiao Wangma said in a low voice, "Don't ask, that Director Miao has a big temper. He scolds us and is not friendly at all. If he answers the phone a little late, he will scold us." Zhu Zhai listened and only shrugged his shoulders and said, "What does the boss mean? Why would he make friends with this kind of person? I want to persuade her today." Xiao Wangma quickly waved her hand and said, "You have to pay attention. The boss has not been in a good mood these days and gets angry at every turn!" Zhu Zhai said, "I mean well. It's about her future and reputation. I must persuade her and do my duty." When Zhu Zhai said this, his voice was a little louder. Qiwan had already heard it inside and asked, "Who is talking outside?" Xiao Wangma quickly replied, "It's Mr. Xu." When Zhu Zhai heard this, he pushed the door open and went in. He saw Qiwan lying on the bed, only covering the red brocade quilt to her chest, with her two arms completely exposed. He nodded to her and said, "Aren't you afraid of catching a cold?" Qiwan only shook her head slightly. Zhu Zhai sat down on the edge of her bed and said, "We haven't seen each other for several days. I brought a message today. Don't be angry when you see it. I think someone hates you and is fabricating rumors." As he spoke, he took out the newspaper and handed it to Qiwan. Qiwan looked at where he was pointing, and her face turned slightly red. She glared at Zhu Zhai, put the newspaper next to her pillow, and didn't say a word. Zhu Zhai said, "It's not clear how to publish it like this. Many people outside say it's about you. I want to clarify it. It's not worth it to take the blame for someone else!" Qiwan's face sank and she said, "This is not a wrong accusation. Director Miao did give me a big demerit!" When Zhu Zhai saw that Qiwan admitted it, he didn't know what to say. He stayed for a while and said, "I don't think there's any benefit in dealing with this kind of person. It's better to avoid him as soon as possible to avoid further trouble." Qiwan said, "I have my own reasons for getting to know him." Zhu Zhai said, "What reasons?"
