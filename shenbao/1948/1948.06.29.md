### Presidential Couple Return to Capital; Meet with Liu Maoen, etc. in Zhengzhou; National Flags Fly Over Kaifeng, City Returns to Normal

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] President Chiang, having departed the capital on the 21st for an inspection tour, has now completed his duties. At approximately 7:00 PM on the 28th, he and his wife, along with their entourage, returned to the capital aboard the "Chung Cheng" special plane. The President wore a traditional Chinese robe and black mandarin jacket, while the First Lady was dressed in a navy blue Western suit. After the plane landed, the First Lady was the first to disembark, and Chiang Ching-kuo, the President's son, was at the airport to greet them. The President appeared to be in high spirits and immediately returned to his official residence to rest. The President departed Xi'an at 1:30 PM and arrived in Zhengzhou at 3:00 PM. He stayed in Zhengzhou for three hours, during which time he summoned the Chairman of Henan Province, Liu Maoen, and General Sun Zhen, whose troops, along with General Qiu Qingquan's, were among the first to enter Bian (Kaifeng), dividing their forces into two routes. He inquired in detail about the Battle of Kaifeng and then departed Zhengzhou for the capital by plane at 6:00 PM.

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 28th] After a week's visit, the President and his wife departed by the "Chung Cheng" special plane for Zhengzhou en route to the capital on the afternoon of the 28th. Yu Chi-shih and more than 30 others accompanied them. The citizens of Xi'an were unable to see them off due to the rain and muddy conditions. Before his departure, the President summoned senior generals, including Zhang Zhizhong, Hu Zongnan, and Zhu Shaozhou, and gave them instructions. Ma Bufang and Ma Hongbin, among others, left here today to return to Lanzhou.

[Our Kaifeng Dispatch, 27th] Chairman Liu Maoen of Henan Province had a long conversation with our reporter by candlelight on the night of his entry into the city. He believes that the greatest crisis in Henan Province lies in the fact that local armed forces, without the government's timely cultivation, will ultimately be exploited by bandits who will use both soft and hard tactics, leading to a state of helplessness. Regarding the Central Plains war situation, he believes that the communists absolutely dare not cross the Yangtze River rashly. The government's countermeasures should focus on increasing troop strength and unified command.

Director Cao of the President's special inspection team, fourth group, flew to Bian from Zhengzhou today to express his condolences to Chairman Liu. General Qiu Qingquan, commander of the Fifth Army, and various division and brigade commanders also extended their condolences to Chairman Liu.

[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch, 27th] Although only two days have passed since the recapture of Kaifeng, everything is already returning to normal. After entering the city, Chairman Liu worked through the night with senior provincial officials to properly plan resettlement matters. Today, the citizens of the city are bustling and coming and going in droves, and most of the shops have also reopened. This afternoon, the reporter left Bian by plane for Zhengzhou. While circling over Kaifeng, he saw national flags flying all over the city under the sunlight, indicating that Kaifeng will move towards a new life in hardship from now on.

The battle situation at the northern and southern passes is relatively calm, and the National Army is firmly defending its original positions.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 28th] The battle for Yanzhou is becoming increasingly fierce. The National Army, which is advancing north from Teng County to support and reinforce Yanzhou, was still engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits north of the Jie River on the 27th.

### Heroic Deeds During the Battle of Bian; Division Commander Li Zhongnian Commits Suicide for the Cause; Body Still Missing

[Our Kaifeng Dispatch, 27th] The news that General Li Zhongnian, commander of the reorganized 66th Division, committed suicide for the cause during the defense of Kaifeng has been confirmed by our reporter's investigation. According to reports, Li personally led the 37th Regiment of the 13th Brigade of his division to supervise the battle at Longting in the northern city of Bian at the beginning of the war. After the fall of Bian, his whereabouts remained unknown. This morning, the reporter drove to the northern city to investigate and happened to meet Li's adjutant, Tan Shiying, who, after escaping from captivity, was collecting Li's belongings in the area. According to Tan, on the evening of the 21st, when the battle situation in Bian was on the verge of being unsalvageable, Li was seriously wounded but still led the remaining troops in the command post at Nengting to resist the attacking bandits. At 9:10 PM, the Longting stronghold could no longer be defended, and Tan carried Li to a certain bunker in the northern city to rest. However, the war became more and more intense, and the communist artillery fire intensified, fiercely attacking this remaining stronghold. General Li knew that the situation was hopeless. At 9:15 PM, he pointed the revolver he was carrying at his right temple and committed suicide with one shot. At that time, Tan was still standing by his side and was immediately captured. Li's body is still missing. At the place where Li died, the reporter only saw a pool of blood and Li's belt.

Resolutions were made: (1) Send a telegram to the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Ministry of National Defense, demanding a thorough investigation of the responsibility for the loss of Kaifeng and the indiscriminate bombing by aircraft, and severely punish those responsible.

### Executive Yuan Approves Government Employees to Draw Half-Month's Salary in Advance

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] News from the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan: The standard for the payment of living allowances for civil and military personnel is determined on a monthly basis according to the living index of the previous month. The salaries of civil and military personnel for July must be adjusted after the indexes of various regions for June have been collected. Recently, prices have risen sharply, and the lives of civil and military personnel in various regions have become more difficult. The Executive Yuan is deeply concerned about this and intends to allow all civil and military employees, soldiers, and police across the country to temporarily borrow half a month's salary at the June standard before the July salaries are adjusted.

### Review Committee of Control Yuan Presents Two Opinions

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 28th] The review committee formed by the Control Yuan on the Executive Yuan's reply to the corrective motion on price stabilization held a meeting at 8:00 PM on the 28th, presided over by convener Wang Guanwu. After discussion, two opinions were compiled and scheduled to be submitted to the general meeting on the 29th. If passed, the Executive Yuan will be urged again to take emergency and effective measures to deal with the soaring prices, and members will be dispatched to Beiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai to investigate and report. The two opinions are as follows: (1) The corrective motion of this Yuan was submitted on June 16. The main purpose of the original motion was to suggest that the Executive Yuan take emergency and effective measures to suppress the price increase, given that prices had risen sharply from the beginning to the middle of June. According to the reply, only a list of policy principles is given, and there is no explanation of the implementation or the results, especially the soaring prices in the most recent week (June 23 to 28), which shows that even if the Executive Yuan has taken measures, they have not been effective. Therefore, this Yuan should re-resolve this case and transfer it to the Executive Yuan to take emergency and effective measures as soon as possible to quickly stop the soaring prices. (2) The current soaring prices are clearly manipulated by artificial factors. This Yuan should send members to Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin to conduct a thorough investigation and report in order to suppress them. In addition, the Executive Yuan's measures and whether the personnel implementing them are performing poorly should be thoroughly investigated.

### Minister of Finance Studies Measures; Earnestly Stabilizes Prices

Rumors of Wang Yunwu's Resignation are Inaccurate

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] There have been rumors that Wang Yunwu resigned because he felt that prices could not be stabilized, but according to sources in the Ministry of Finance on the 28th, this information is completely inaccurate. Wang smiled and dismissed the news when he saw it in the newspaper on the 28th and told senior officials in the ministry that there was no such thing. It is also learned that Wang is studying effective measures to stabilize prices in response to the recent price increases.

### National Army in Eastern Hebei Enters Changli; Fighting Resumes in the Beiping-Tianjin-Baoding Triangle

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 28th] National Army troops in eastern Hebei have entered Changli on the 28th. The bandits are rapidly fleeing north, and the air force has followed up with bombing. However, the military has not yet confirmed this.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] The communist army on the Yongyu section continues to collapse north. Today's air force report states that the National Army is coordinating with the air force to pursue in separate groups. Today's east-bound train reached Jia Dian.

[Our Qinhuangdao Dispatch, 28th] The National Army in eastern Hebei is being attacked from both east and west. The western route has approached Changli, and the eastern route captured the Qiyun Temple highlands northeast of Beidaihe at 8:00 PM on the 27th. However, the threat to the National Army's garrison on Qin Island is still great, and the National Army is working hard to eliminate it. There was a fierce battle at Luwang Village northwest of Beidaihe on the 28th.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] After a long period of silence, fighting has resumed in the Beiping-Tianjin-Baoding triangle. Jiugang, Banjiawo, and Hugezhuang (all between Xiong County and Ba County) were once lost. On the 26th, local teams encountered more than 3,000 troops from the communist 7th Column. The bandits once broke into the southwest positions, but the National Army reinforcements arrived later and finally recovered Jiugang, Banjiawo, and Hugezhuang. The bandits retreated southeast.

### Current Situation is Indeed Critical; Let Us Work Together to Complete the Pacification; Bai Chongxi's Speech at Welcome Meeting in Hankou

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 28th] The Wuhan community held a welcome meeting for Commander-in-Chief Bai this afternoon at 3:00 PM. He Chengjun, Zhang Dulun, Fang Juehui, and others delivered welcome speeches one after another, expressing their eagerness for the early success of the pacification. Bai then gave a speech, pointing out that the pure military suppression of bandits has failed. We cannot deny failure as victory. In the future, if we want to complete the great cause of pacification and national construction, the party, government, and military must all change their styles, start anew with the people, and thoroughly implement total war. We must use military force to cover politics and economy, to control manpower, control food, and control intelligence, to stabilize people's livelihoods and achieve "land to the tiller". Bai said: "The strategy of fighting for points and lines has fallen behind. We must strengthen overall control in response to the communist conspiracy." Finally, he pointed out that the Wuhan training work is only a formality and listed the effectiveness of military-civilian cooperation in eastern Hubei, appealing to the people of central and northern Hubei and other places to assist the National Army in jointly eliminating the remaining bandits. Bai said in a cautious tone: "The current situation is indeed critical and we are at the point of being besieged. We must work together and participate in the pacification work with a conscious and active attitude." Note: The effectiveness of military-civilian cooperation in eastern Hubei mentioned by Bai refers to the fact that rafts can be used for combat and even platoons can act independently, which is a major advance in military affairs.

[Another Telegram] According to Commander-in-Chief Bai at the welcome meeting: (1) The jurisdiction of the Bandit Suppression General Headquarters is slightly different from what has been reported and is generally limited to the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui; (2) A Pacification Headquarters will be established in central Hubei, and Zhang Gan will be appointed as the commander; (3) The bandits who attacked Zaoshi have been defeated, and Yingcheng Southwest has also been relieved of the siege. Another source says: Zhang Gan, Wang Lingyun, and Huo Kuizhang have arrived in Hankou one after another and will attend the military conference of the Bandit Suppression General Headquarters.

### Executive Yuan's Reply on Stabilizing Prices; Control Yuan Members Believe It Is Impractical; Appointed Members to Draft Opinions to Submit to Yuan Meeting for Discussion

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The 12th meeting of the first session of the Control Yuan under the Constitution was held at 9:30 AM on the 28th, presided over by Yu Youren. First, the secretariat read out the minutes of the 11th meeting, followed by the report and discussion of various cases as follows: (1) A letter from the Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee, stating that it will review the draft Control Law at 3:00 PM on June 28, requesting attendance for explanation. It was decided to recommend members Tian Jiongjin, Chen Qinghua, and Tang Honglie to attend and explain the drafting process. (2) A respectful telegram from Gao Xibing and others from Shenyang, requesting that the two cities of Panyang and Changchun be included in the U.S. aid material distribution area. It was decided to recommend members Wang Guanwu, Cao Dexuan, Gu Fengxiang, Wang Weiqi, and Qi Dapeng to investigate with the Executive Yuan and then submit it to the meeting for discussion. (3) A motion proposed by Li Xuhuan and 37 others to amend Article 26 of Chapter 5 of the draft Control Law. It was resolved to pass the original motion and send it to the Legislative Yuan for amendment. (4) The Executive Yuan's official letter on the handling of price stabilization in response to the corrective motion previously submitted by the Control Yuan was delivered. The content was very detailed, but the members believed that it was impractical. Hao Yulin proposed a temporary motion stating: "Prices have been fluctuating rapidly in recent days, and the general public is worried. The Executive Yuan's response to the Yuan's corrective motion on soaring prices is grand in content, but it is mostly empty talk and does not help in practice. It is proposed that the general meeting select a number of members to review it and decide on the next step. Please vote." Then Quan Shaowen also proposed a temporary motion with similar views to Hao's motion, which was submitted to the meeting for discussion. Zhang Dinghua spoke first, believing that it was necessary to organize a committee for review. Li Zhengle advocated sending members to the Executive Yuan for investigation. Cui Jingzhang believed that it was necessary to form a committee to review the case and that we should form a special committee for comprehensive discussion. After a majority agreed, it was decided to recommend Wang Guanwu, Xing Senzhou, Sun Yulin, Zhang Dinghua, Zhang Weihan, Cui Shuyan, Hu Wenhui, Liu Pingjiang, Liu Liezhi, and others to form a committee to review it and draft specific opinions to submit to the meeting for discussion. Finally, the draft organizational regulations of the Control Yuan's traveling office were discussed. However, due to time constraints, only Article 3 was discussed, and the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting. Also, the meeting was adjourned in the afternoon because the members went to the Executive and Legislative Yuan respectively, and it was scheduled to hold the 13th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 29th. (The full text of Dean Weng's reply on prices can be found in the left corner.)

### Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economic Committee Ratifies Flour and Cotton Yarn Tax Rates; Review of Temporary Property Tax Law Not Yet Completed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Finance and Economic Committee of the Legislative Yuan reviewed the flour tax, which the former National Government submitted to the former Legislative Yuan for reconsideration, and approved the collection of 2.5 percent. The cotton yarn tax rate was increased to 10 percent. In addition to approving the case for ratification, three supplementary opinions were passed: (1) The current tax revenue is biased towards military goods tax, and direct tax should be emphasized in the future. (2) After price stabilization, the tax rate of cotton yarn and other ad valorem taxes should be given more consideration. (3) The adjustment period for ad valorem tax should be shortened as much as possible according to the actual situation. The committee's temporary property tax and investigation of wealthy families' capital group held another meeting in the afternoon of the 28th to continue discussing various pending issues: (1) Regarding the tax rate for profitable businesses, the starting point for taxation was resolved to be raised to 300,000 yuan in the currency value of 1937. (2) Regarding the taxation of overseas Chinese property, it was resolved to add an item to the general provisions chapter, stipulating that "overseas Chinese property outside the country is exempt from taxation." (3) Regarding the taxation of foreign property in China, the discussion lasted a long time. Finally, it was passed to add an item to the general provisions chapter, stipulating that "in order to encourage foreign and overseas Chinese investment in production enterprises within the territory of the Republic of China, foreign and overseas Chinese property may be reduced or exempted by the government depending on the nature of their businesses and property." However, Cui Jingbo, Liu Butong, Zhu Wende, and others all believed that there should not be such special and unfair regulations, and they decided to raise their objections again when this preliminary draft is submitted to the Finance and Economic Committee. The group will also ask the conveners of the Finance and Economic Committee to report at the meeting on the 29th the reasons why the temporary property tax law could not be reviewed completely and request an extension. The next group meeting is scheduled for the afternoon of the 30th.

### Effectively Utilize U.S. Aid; Complete Rural Reconstruction; 21 Organizations Draft Plan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Chinese Society of Agronomy, the Chinese Society of Land Economics, and 21 other academic organizations jointly hosted Chinese and foreign reporters on the 28th to report on the main points of the "Chinese Rural Reconstruction Plan" drafted by these organizations.

In addition to military aid and economic construction loans, U.S. aid also designates one-tenth of the economic stabilization loans for rural reconstruction. The Executive Yuan will organize a Rural Reconstruction Committee to be responsible for guidance and supervision. There will be five executive members, three from China and two from the United States.

The plan drafted by these organizations aims to effectively utilize U.S. aid and complete rural reconstruction. It is divided into two major parts: one is the basic work of rural reconstruction, including land reform, farmland water conservancy, etc.; the other is the production increase work of rural reconstruction, including food exports, and the production increase work of materials, clothing, timber, livestock, etc. The total budget listed in the plan is US$29,374,368, of which US$23,037,000 is used for basic work. Of this, about US$800,000 is needed for land reform, and US$6,338,753 is used for production increase work.

It is also learned that the plan has been submitted to the Executive Yuan a few days ago. Zou Bingwen also paid a visit to Dean Weng at 3:00 PM on the 28th and presented the plan again in person. He also suggested to Weng that the Chinese members of the Rural Reconstruction Committee should be experts and people with knowledge and experience. Weng expressed his willingness to adopt these suggestions.

### Shen Honglie Leaves Hangzhou for Shanghai

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 28th] Shen Honglie took the Jinling ship to Shanghai at 8:00 AM this morning. More than a thousand people from various organizations, groups, schools, and department heads of the provincial government in the provincial capital went to the train station to see him off and presented a banner that said "Meritorious Deeds in Zhejiang", and Shen shook hands with the send-off people frequently to bid farewell.

### Weng Wenhao's Reply to the Control Yuan: Explaining the Situation of Stabilizing Prices; Large Military Expenditures Make Inflation Still Unavoidable

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 28th Dispatch] The Control Yuan previously pointed out that prices were soaring, but the authorities had not taken timely measures, and submitted a correction proposal to the Executive Yuan. Recently, the Executive Yuan has submitted a reply to the Control Yuan regarding the handling of price stabilization and the various points raised by the Control Yuan. The details are as follows:

Your letter of June 16th, Constitutional Letter No. 14, is respectfully acknowledged. The methods to stabilize prices are none other than suppressing internal rebellion, stabilizing society, increasing production, ensuring sufficient supply, improving transportation, facilitating transport, promoting exports, developing national trade, rectifying finances, and suppressing inflation, in order to address the root cause. Cracking down on hoarding, strictly implementing negotiated prices, price limits, banning the circulation of gold and banknotes, managing foreign exchange, and tightening credit are measures to address the symptoms. Since Wenhao took office as the Executive Yuan, he has never relaxed his efforts. Recently, with the surge in prices, he has taken the following measures in response to the facts: (1) Strengthen financial controls to prevent the excessive issuance of promissory notes, so as to avoid credit inflation and stimulate prices. (2) Promote the sale of treasury bonds to tighten credit. (3) Dispatch responsible personnel to North China to improve exchange rates and sell materials in North China, and order the Ministry of Food to issue emergency measures for regulating the people's food supply, order foreign rice, and continue to organize urban food rationing to stabilize public morale. All of these are emergency countermeasures that the government can take today. However, the military situation in various war zones is still very intense, and military expenditures are still very large. The fact of inflation is still unavoidable for the time being, and the upward trend in prices is unlikely to stop quickly. It requires the government and the people of the whole country to jointly understand the difficulties and work together to bring into play the effect of the aforementioned fundamental methods. The Executive Yuan is determined to overcome all difficulties and do its best.

As for the various measures pointed out in the original proposal that the administrative authorities are contributing to the rise in prices, in order to clarify the facts for the members of your esteemed Yuan, I will explain them separately below:

National Banks' Loans: Strict Review, No Leniency

1. Regarding national banks' loans, in order to prevent them from flowing into speculative markets and stimulating prices, they were suspended at the end of October of the 36th year. Later, because general legitimate production enterprises lacked funds and were unable to start or had difficulty with turnover, loans had to be resumed from March of this year. However, in order to prevent abuses, the board of directors of the four joint banks approved and formulated the "Lending Guidelines for Production Enterprises for the 37th Year" (attached). The regulations regarding the review and approval of loans are extremely strict. The targets of production enterprise loans are limited to: 1. production and marketing enterprises for daily necessities of the people's livelihood, 2. basic industrial and mining enterprises, 3. public utility enterprises, 4. export trade enterprises, etc. The lending methods are also stipulated as follows: 1. order loans or purchase of manufactured products, 2. commissioned production, 3. short-term capital turnover, including export packing loans, etc., 4. other loans related to national economic policy. In recent months, all loan cases have been reviewed in accordance with this, without any leniency. The responsibility for lending has been separately stipulated, and the assessment has been carried out diligently to ensure that all funds are used in accordance with the original purpose. It is difficult to say that it is laissez-faire. As for the loan interest rate, according to the above-mentioned lending guidelines, the general principle for production enterprises that are responsible for their own profits and losses is to calculate it with reference to the market interest rate, but it should not exceed the local central bank's listed market interest rate, and loans that fully cooperate with national policy are still handled according to the principle of low interest. Therefore, it is difficult to say that the loan interest rate is too high.

State-Run Transportation Enterprises: Leading Price Increases Is Untrue

2. The prices of services provided by state-run enterprises have had to be adjusted accordingly to maintain operations, as general prices have continued to rise and costs have increased sharply. Although postal, telecommunications, railways, etc., have relied on subsidies from the national treasury for many years, they have still been given appropriate subsidies based on losses. It is even less the case that they rely solely on price increases. The intention is to avoid stimulating prices. Therefore, the transportation prices and postal and telecommunications rates of state-run transportation enterprises have only been adjusted in line with the general price increases, and are far behind. For example, in May of this year, prices rose to about 500,000 times the pre-war level, while transportation costs were only about 130,000 times the pre-war level. The transportation cost adjustment in early June was only about 200,000 times the pre-war level. To say that this is leading price increases is not true. Three sets of statistical charts of prices and transportation costs are attached for reference.

Currency Reform Issue: The Government Is in a Difficult Situation

3. In recent months, domestic public opinion has urged the government to reform the currency system, and many statements have been issued. Many legislators in the Legislative Yuan have also inquired about this. The Executive Yuan has replied that it is studying the matter, but has not mentioned the content of the reform, fearing that it would affect the market. The government's financial officials have not made any advocacy. As the depreciation of legal tender has reached the current stage, the government cannot deny the fact of inflation, and legislators, scholars, and experts all hope for a fundamental solution as soon as possible. The government's situation is very difficult. In the future, the government should be extra cautious, and it is hoped that leaders in society will be able to share the difficulties of the times and refrain from publishing empty and stimulating remarks before the research and preparation are fully completed. In this way, the concerns of your esteemed Yuan can be avoided.

In the future, if your esteemed Yuan has any questions about administrative work that need to be inquired about, the Executive Yuan will provide information at any time and truthfully explain the truth.

The above is a report on the handling of this case and the facts of the matter. Please review it. This is addressed to the Control Yuan.

Attached is a copy of the "Lending Guidelines for Production Enterprises for the 37th Year" from the Joint Office of the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks.

Enclosed are a comparison chart of transportation price adjustments and price increases, an explanation, and a comparison table of transportation price adjustments and price increases.

Enclosed are a comparison chart of prices and transportation costs in early June of this year, and an explanation.

Dean Weng Wenhao

Editorial

### Crisis of the Ashida Cabinet

The wavering Ashida Cabinet of Japan, after overcoming the risks of the past month, has temporarily stabilized its power with the support of the Allied General Headquarters' Political Bureau. However, it has not been fully secured. The no-confidence movement being carried out by the opposition parties in the Japanese Diet is developing vigorously. Whether Ashida can safely overcome the difficulties and whether the budget proposal and the Nishio corruption case can be calmed down are truly doubtful. Even if the Allied Forces have the power to guide the Japanese political tide across the shore and MacArthur's advice to the Japanese people to stop political infighting will have temporary effects, no one dares to say for sure whether the Ashida Cabinet will not undergo changes by July.

The Ashida Cabinet has only been established for more than three months; and the setbacks encountered in the past three months have been more dangerous than the crises of a three-year regime. Ashida Hitoshi, who is known for his adaptability, also feels trapped. The Tokyo Kyodo News Agency recently issued a dispatch saying that "the downfall of the Ashida Cabinet can be counted on the fingers." General observers also believe that "the Ashida Cabinet is currently moving towards a political dead end." This is enough to show the magnitude of the risks Ashida has encountered in the past three months, the depth of the crisis, and the weight of the worries. The development and evolution of the matter can be divided into the following aspects:

First, Ashida Cabinet's masterpiece was the announcement of the "Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan." According to the implementation of this plan, Japan would be able to become stronger by 1952, and the US government also strongly supported this plan. The thorough implementation of this plan requires US funds and raw materials. The US government has submitted a loan to Japan bill to Congress to help with the initial plan's development. Due to the unease of countries such as China, Australia, and the Philippines, and the opposition of public opinion, the US Congress reduced the loan to Japan by 150 million, that is, reducing the total aid by three-sevenths. This was an unexpected blow to the Ashida Cabinet. The Ashida Cabinet, which could have been supported by the Japanese people, after being hit by this blow, the Japanese people's belief in Ashida was shaken, and even the media doubted the success of the Five-Year Plan. This can be said to be the biggest risk and setback encountered by the Ashida Cabinet.

Second, Ashida Cabinet drafted this year's budget proposal a month ago, preparing to submit it to the current Diet for approval. The budget proposal includes a method of suspending the payment of war debt interest for one year. In order to increase government revenue, it is expected to collect 1,000,000,000 yen in taxes out of the total national income of 1,906,000,000 yen. This method was advocated by the left wing of the Socialist Party, but it was not implemented in the Katayama Cabinet, which caused a crisis within the Katayama Cabinet. The Democratic Party cooperated with the left wing of the Socialist Party, and the left wing took this policy as a condition. The policy is correct, but unfortunately, the Japanese taxpayers—the Zaibatsu groups and their kept conservative political parties (such as the Liberal Party and the right wing of the Democratic Party)—fiercely opposed it in the Diet and spread rumors outside the Diet, resulting in the defection of eight members of the right wing of the Democratic People's Party. The Democratic Party led by Ashida was originally a minority party in the Diet. Now, it has been reduced from 92 seats to 84 seats, and there is a possibility of further reduction, which makes Ashida's position more fragile. Now, the Ashida Cabinet's pillar of support in the Diet completely depends on the left and right wings of the Socialist Party.

Third, the right wing of the Socialist Party, with the current Deputy Prime Minister Hiroo Nishio as the main body, has considerable control in the Diet. Recently, Nishio had a dishonorable incident. Someone reported that he had embezzled 500,000 yen; this is a big stain in Japanese political history. Now, this corruption case is being investigated by the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office. Nishio stated on the 10th that he was willing to resign and retire, and was willing to accept the internal rectification of the Socialist Party, but Ashida Hitoshi supported him and wanted to completely eliminate this accusation. Katayama Tetsu, the leader of the Socialist Party, issued a statement on the 15th: "Nishio is a current cabinet member and should wait until the investigation is clear before deciding whether he must resign." According to Katayama and Ashida's intentions, Nishio will not resign before the budget proposal is passed; after the budget proposal is passed, Nishio will resign in accordance with the environment. The view of the Allied General Headquarters' Political Bureau is also the same; therefore, Ashida's approach may be to sacrifice Nishio in exchange for the passage of the budget proposal. He is completely thinking about the revival of the regime. It is doubtful whether the opposition parties in the Diet will accept Ashida's opinion; and 63 members of the Socialist Party have expressed their disagreement, and coordination has not yet been achieved, which has buried endless crises for the passage of the budget proposal.

The development of the above facts shows that the Ashida Cabinet's move towards a "political dead end" was not accidental, but a well-founded observation. Judging from the general trend, the Ashida Cabinet can temporarily gain stability with the support of the Allied Forces. If Ashida's adaptation is successful, the storms in the Diet may also be passed safely. However, overcoming a difficult situation does not fundamentally resolve Ashida Hitoshi's crisis. At that time, Ashida's approach will be two: (1) After Deputy Prime Minister Nishio resigns, change his political strategy and cooperate with Shigeru Yoshida, attracting the opposition party to resign; (2) Hold a general election and reorganize the government. No matter which of the above two paths Ashida Hitoshi takes, he is only doing some paving work for the conservative forces.

### National Banks' Production Enterprise Loan Policy for the 37th Year

1.  Loans from national banks and treasuries should be handled separately using the following methods: (1) Order loans or purchase of finished products, (2) Commissioned manufacturing, (3) Short-term capital turnover, including export packing loans, etc., (4) Other loans related to national economic policy approved as special cases by the chairman or vice-chairman through council deliberation.

2.  Loan recipients are stipulated as follows: (1) General Categories: (A) Production and sales enterprises of daily necessities for people's livelihood, (B) Basic industrial and mining enterprises, (C) Public transportation enterprises, (D) Export trade enterprises. (2) Applications for loans from those whose material production and sales or business fees are entirely regulated should be processed with priority.

3.  Loan interest rates should be calculated with reference to market interest rates, based on the nature of the loan, as a principle. Deposit interest rates should also be raised accordingly. Detailed measures should be further negotiated and approved separately with reference to the original proposal from the Secretariat on adjusting interest rates on October 20, 36th year.

4.  Loan funding sources should be handled according to the following items: (1) Banks and treasuries handling loan business should, as a principle, use their own surplus funds for allocation. (2) Various loans that support national policy, once approved by the Joint Council of the Four Banks, may at any time be re-mortgaged, re-pledged, or rediscounted with the Central Bank. However, the total limit of re-mortgages and short-term borrowing should be submitted by the Central Bank to the Council for approval. (3) Certain types of loans assigned by the government with relatively special characteristics may be directly allocated from the national treasury. (4) The Central Bank will cease direct loans to production enterprises. (5) Public funds of military and government agencies should be deposited entirely in the Central Bank.

Funds of state-owned enterprises may be held by the various banks and treasuries according to their professional nature.

5.  The review and investigation of loans and re-mortgages should be handled according to the following items: (1) Various order loans, purchase of inventory, commissioned manufacturing, and other loans supporting national policy should be handled according to past practice after being approved by the Council, or after the approval of plans and measures, under the supervision of the Central Bank by the various banks and treasuries separately.

The Discount and Lending Committee may have advisory committees for industry, mining, agriculture, and exports. (4) The assessment of loans should be carried out diligently to ensure that the loans achieve the maximum effect according to the original plan. The responsibility for assessment is stipulated as follows: (A) Each bank and treasury should be responsible for the assessment of loans it has independently approved and report periodically. (B) The Central Bank is responsible for the assessment of loans supporting national policy and the confidential review of re-mortgaged loans, and report periodically. (C) The Joint Administration of the Four Banks should also jointly with the Ministry of Finance conduct random inspections of the loan business of the various banks and treasuries to assess the effectiveness of the loans.

Comparative Chart of Freight Rate Adjustments and Price Increases (Omitted) Explanation Recorded as Follows:

(1) The chart shows that although freight rate increases follow the same trend as price increases, the multiple of freight rate adjustments has maintained a considerable proportion to the multiple of price increases since the 35th year, with the former accounting for only about 25% of the latter.

(2) However, as prices rise higher, the cost of freight increases dramatically, and maintaining the aforementioned proportion will be extremely difficult. However, the absolute values of the two multiples still differ significantly. In May of this year, the difference between the two was more than 300,000 times. Although freight rates have been adjusted this month (June), the difference between the two is still more than this number.

Comparative Chart of Prices and Freight Rates in Early June of This Year (Omitted) Explanation Recorded as Follows:

This chart uses the price at the time of the last freight rate adjustment on April 1 as the standard. From this observation, two points can be obtained:

(1) Freight rates were not adjusted in May, while gold and rice prices have increased by more than 100%, and coal and cloth prices have also increased by more than 60%.

(2) After the freight rate adjustment in early June, the upward trend of various commodities has largely remained the same (coal prices rose sharply before freight rates, and gold prices rose sharply nearly half a month after freight rates). It does not seem that freight rates are leading commodity prices.

### Thousands of Houses Destroyed, Thousands Injured or Killed; Major Tsunami and Earthquake in Central Japan; Fukui Prefecture Almost Entirely Destroyed, Fires Raging in Kanagawa Prefecture; Japanese Cabinet and GHQ Launching Relief Efforts

[Report from This Newspaper] San Francisco Radio, 28th: Tokyo report that a major earthquake has occurred in Toyama and other places in Japan. Due to transportation disruptions, the exact number of dead and injured is difficult to determine. It is reported that the death toll is between 300 and 900, with 300 bodies found in Toyama alone. Reports from various locations indicate that the number of casualties is continuously increasing.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 28th] A major earthquake occurred in central Japan on the afternoon of the 28th, followed by a tsunami, resulting in thousands of casualties and the destruction of dozens of houses. Several towns were razed to the ground, leaving 100,000 people homeless. Initial estimates put the death toll at 600, with at least two passenger trains destroyed. MacArthur has issued a special proclamation ordering the US occupation authorities to provide as much assistance as possible. The Japanese cabinet has also held an emergency meeting to discuss relief measures. Large fires broke out in many areas of the earthquake zone, and refugees are fleeing in droves. Some say that the extent of the damage is no less than the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923. MacArthur has ordered the dispatch of 70-80 aircraft to the disaster area to transport medicine and food and evacuate refugees. The Japanese cabinet has also approved a relief fund of 100 million yen and requested assistance from the US authorities to facilitate relief efforts. Some reports estimate 800 deaths, 100,000 injuries, and property losses of US$30 million.

[United Press, Tokyo, 28th] The area along the Sea of Japan in central Japan was shaken by four powerful earthquakes on the afternoon of the 28th, followed by at least nine tsunamis that slammed the coast. Fragmentary reports indicate that the number of casualties in the three prefectures along the Sea of Japan is at least 300. Most telecommunications have been destroyed. No injuries to Allied personnel have been reported so far, but there is little news coming out of the hardest-hit areas. It is only known that large fires are raging in several cities. The Telecommunications Department here has received reports that Fukui City, with a population of 52,000, is "virtually annihilated," and Kanagawa Prefecture, with a population of 200,000, is "burning." The earthquake began at 3:14 PM and lasted for 20 minutes, affecting coastal prefectures and cities south of Toyama Bay. The Jiji Press reported that the Nagoya Railway Bureau reported 300 casualties in Daishoji Town, with one-third of the town's houses collapsed. The Mainichi Shimbun reported that the Nagoya Observatory reported "ten tsunamis" along the coasts of Ishikawa and Fukui prefectures, with nine waves having already hit the coastal defenses. Jiji Press Nagoya reports that one passenger train overturned, and three sections of another passenger train also overturned. The Nagoya Railway Bureau believes that "the number of casualties must be high." US telecommunications officer Schomp reported from Nagoya that he had contacted the Kanagawa police, who said that half of Fukui Prefecture had been destroyed and that several places in Kanagawa were on fire, but the situation was under control. Other reports indicate that large cracks have appeared in the ground in many places. The US Army has been unable to contact the military government groups in the earthquake zone. The US military also said that the Kyoto area experienced four consecutive earthquakes, lasting a total of 32 seconds. The most severely affected area was Fukui. Reports indicate that Toyama Prefecture is on fire, and Tokyo clocks have stopped. The Tokyo Central Meteorological Observatory announced that a "considerably strong" earthquake struck central and western Japan, affecting the entire Kanto region and part of Shikoku.

[Associated Press, Honolulu, 28th] A very strong earthquake occurred here this morning, shaking for several minutes. Residents were awakened from their dreams and fled to the streets. No damage has been reported.

### Sudden Deterioration of Soviet-Yugoslav Relations; Cominform Expels Yugoslavia; Major Loophole in the Eastern European Bloc

[Report from This Newspaper] London Radio, 28th: It is reported that the Soviet Union has recently expressed deep dissatisfaction with the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and its leaders, and decided to purge them at a secret meeting of the Cominform held in Romania in June. The Soviet side believes that Yugoslavia is not loyal enough to the communist bloc and has failed to please Western imperialist countries. The accusations made were very severe, adding serious charges such as anti-Sovietism and Trotskyism.

[United Press, Prague, 28th] A communique released here on the 28th revealed that the Cominform expelled Yugoslavia from the organization during a meeting held in Romania in mid-June. The communique also condemned Marshal Tito as a Trotskyist and an opponent of the Soviet system.

[Report from This Newspaper] London Radio, 28th: The changing relationship between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia has created a major loophole in the Eastern European front. If Yugoslavia completely severs ties with the Soviet bloc, it will be the greatest victory for Western countries in the "Cold War." It is reported that the Soviet Union is dissatisfied with Yugoslavia because it has not provided sufficient support to the Greek guerrillas. The countries of the Eastern European bloc accuse Yugoslavia of abandoning the "internationalist line."

### Merger of Czech Social Democratic Party and Communist Party

[Reuters, Prague, 27th] Over two thousand delegates of the Czech Social Democratic Party met today and unanimously resolved to merge the Social Democratic Party with the Communist Party.

### It Will Still Take Some Time for Greece to Suppress Guerrillas

[Reuters, Athens, 27th] Greek Prime Minister Sophoulis said after inspecting the front line that the people should not be overly optimistic about the war to suppress the guerrillas. This offensive by the national army is aimed at the heart of the guerrilla base, and it will take a considerable amount of time to complete it successfully. Although the national army has achieved glorious victories, it must still be vigilant in its operations until the guerrillas are completely eliminated.

### US Aid to Europe Bilateral Agreements; Britain, France, Italy, and Other Countries to Sign First

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Several countries will sign bilateral agreements individually negotiated between the United States and sixteen countries on the 28th. The first batch will include Britain, Italy, France, and the Scandinavian countries. It is expected that all European countries will agree to grant most-favored-nation trade treatment to the joint occupation zones in West Germany, and most countries will also agree to grant the same terms to the US-occupied areas in Japan and Korea.

[Agence France-Presse, Dublin, 28th] Ireland and the United States today signed a bilateral agreement for the European Recovery Program.

### Soviet Union Creates Berlin Crisis; Three Powers Prepare to Protest; Shows Abandonment of Appeasement Towards the Soviet Union

[Reuters, London, 28th] The Foreign Office announced that Foreign Secretary Bevin met today with US Ambassador Douglas and German Ambassador Massigli to decide on the method for Britain, the United States, and France to protest the situation in Berlin to the Soviet Union. US Undersecretary of the Army Draper, who is currently in London on his way from the US to Germany, and General Clay, also attended the meeting. British Commander-in-Chief of Germany Robertson returned to London after being summoned and also attended the meeting as an advisor. A Foreign Office spokesman also revealed that Foreign Secretary Bevin is in constant contact with Secretary of State Marshall by telephone.

[Reuters, London, 28th] The next step for Britain, the United States, and France to break the Berlin deadlock will be to lodge a joint protest with the Soviet Union, which is expected to be delivered within the week. Britain and the United States are deeply skeptical about the outcome of the protest to the Soviet Union. After Massigli returns to London from Paris, the three powers will draft a protest note in London. In addition, filing a complaint with the Security Council is not impossible, but even if this is done, it will only be to register with the United Nations so that the Germans can understand that what will happen in the future is not due to the three powers. People here believe that unless the Soviet Union changes its tactics, there will be more serious developments in the future. The attitude of Britain and the United States is to make the Soviet Union understand that, regardless of the consequences, the Western countries will no longer take an appeasing attitude.

### British and American Aircraft Begin Transporting Food to Supply the Western Sector of Berlin

Signs of Easing of Soviet Blockade

[Report from This Newspaper] London Radio, 28th: Berlin reports that ten shiploads of food have arrived in Berlin today. There are signs that the Soviet blockade has eased, but it is still difficult to say whether the situation will be completely clarified.

[Reuters, Berlin, 28th] British and American Air Force transport planes have begun jointly transporting 3,000 pounds of food daily from West Germany to supply the western sector of Berlin. The US Air Force Command announced that it hopes to transfer transport planes from Alaska, the Caribbean, and Texas by the beginning of this week to assist in the transport. Airplanes appeared in the Berlin sky all day today, a great feat by the West since the outbreak of the Berlin crisis. British Royal Air Force planes landed at Tempelhof Airport in the British sector or at the Gatow Airport in the American sector every five minutes. Pedestrians stopped to watch, feeling quite excited.

### Military Committee of the Five-Nation Western European Alliance Holds Secret Meeting in London; Preparing Defense Plans and Seeking Close Liaison with the United States

[Reuters, London, 27th] The Military Committee of the Western Union held a meeting in London, the details of which were kept strictly secret. Observers believe that the meeting has made positive progress on preparing a military defense plan for Western Europe and a detailed plan for engaging in liaison with Washington. The Military Committee and the Permanent Political Committee of the Western European Union meet regularly in London. It is expected that the results of this meeting will form the basis for future negotiations with the United States.

Before these negotiations take place, the Consultative Committee of the five foreign ministers will meet in The Hague at the end of July to review the progress of cooperation between the five Western European countries and the liaison with US policy. Canadian Foreign Minister Laurent recently expressed interest in the fact that if the United States actively participates in Western European defense, Canada will support Western European defense cooperation. It is believed here that after the US presidential election, a closer connection will be established between Western European defense plans and US policy. At that time, the design of the Western European Union itself and the expansion of US military strength will enable the two sides to enter a practical stage of military cooperation.

### Truman Signs Foreign Aid Appropriation Bill

[Report from This Newspaper] New York Radio, 28th: Washington reports that President Truman today signed the US $6 billion foreign aid appropriation bill to provide the largest economic assistance in history to Western European and Far Eastern countries. This funding can be used within fifteen months, but if needed, it can be used within twelve months. President Truman commented that this action demonstrates that the free people of the world can indeed work together to maintain free institutions in stability and peace.

### If Dewey is Elected the Next President, US Foreign Policy Will Not Change; A Consistent Approach to the Soviet Union Will Continue

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] The State Department and the Department of Defense both believe that if Dewey is elected as the next President, the bipartisan policies of Truman and Byrnes will continue. They emphasize that Dewey supports the "Truman Doctrine" and aid to democratic countries around the world, as well as the Marshall Plan and Western Europe's military and economic alliance.

Well-informed sources say that if Dewey is elected as the next President, he will definitely appoint Dulles as Secretary of State. Dulles was a Republican foreign policy advisor at the Moscow and London foreign ministers' conferences and has always maintained close cooperation with Senator Vandenberg of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Well-informed sources believe that Dulles and Vandenberg will continue to cooperate in the Dewey administration to promote the firm policy advocated by the Truman Doctrine. In addition to European issues, Dewey and Dulles are more willing for the United States to pay close attention to developments in the Far East. Vice President nominee Warren, the current governor of California, is even more interested in the countries of the Pacific. Because "California has always been the gateway to the Pacific," Dewey, Dulles, and Warren will adopt a "firm" policy towards the Soviet Union. However, in Europe, their policy will focus on supporting democratic countries, rather than Truman's containment of communism.

### US Black Association Condemns Truman

For Failing to Order the Prohibition of Discrimination Against Blacks

[Associated Press, Kansas City, 27th] The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) held its 39th annual meeting here on the 27th. Executive Secretary White delivered a speech saying that blacks support Wallace because blacks "despise and are disappointed in" the two major parties. White expressed regret that President Truman has not yet ordered the prohibition of discrimination in the federal government. He also said that Republican presidential nominee Dewey avoided mentioning this matter in 1944 in order to be nominated at the convention and elected President, but in 1945 he continued to pass anti-discrimination legislation in New York State.

### Bernadotte Has Proposed New Peace Proposals for the Holy Land to the Arabs and Jews; Arab League Meeting in Cairo Today to Discuss

[Reuters, London, 28th] Arab League Secretary-General Azzam announced in Cairo that the Arab League received Bernadotte's Palestine peace proposals on the 28th, and the Arab League Political Committee will hold a meeting in Cairo on the 29th to discuss them. A spokesman for the Israeli government in Tel Aviv said that the Israeli government is also expected to receive Bernadotte's peace proposals tonight and will study them immediately. They will be presented to the Jewish National Council for discussion on Thursday.

Neither the Arabs nor the Jews are willing to disclose the content of the proposals. However, Arab League sources say that any necessary modifications will be proposed, indicating that the Arab League is expected to accept the proposals. A dispatch from Rhodes states that Bernadotte said that after the Arabs and Jews study his proposals, they are free to offer opinions and suggestions, and that he will give full consideration to all suggestions from both sides, because peace is always the ultimate goal of the United Nations. Observers in London are unwilling to predict the outcome before the content of Bernadotte's proposals is announced, but judging from the positions already declared by the Arabs and Jews, it is still unclear how the opinions of both sides can be brought into agreement.

### British Dockworkers' Strike Spreads; Threatening Food Supplies and Hitting Exports; Government Authorities Prepare to Take Emergency Measures

[Report from This Newspaper] London Radio, 28th: British Prime Minister Attlee said today that the government has asked the King to declare a state of emergency to deal with the dockworkers' strike, as the strike is threatening Britain's food supplies and hitting exports. Attlee also said that the government will take all necessary measures to maintain the nation's food supply.

[Reuters, London, 28th] The London dockworkers' strike, which entered its third week, spread to the two major ports of Liverpool and Glasgow today, and then continued to expand. Dockworkers at the export port of Birkenhead also went on strike en masse this afternoon. The strike committee announced that workers in the ports of Southampton and Manchester would decide tonight whether or not to strike. To date, the number of dockworkers on strike in various places has reached 40,000, including 19,000 in the Inner London area. The Cabinet held an emergency meeting at 10 Downing Street to discuss countermeasures. Trade Minister Wilson issued an urgent appeal to the workers, urging them to act rationally, pointing out that the losses to the export industry have already reached millions of pounds, and if the strike is prolonged, the losses will be even greater.

### British Prime Minister's Speech Condemns Communist Ideology

[Reuters, Skegness, Lincolnshire, 27th] Prime Minister Attlee addressed 25,000 farmworkers here, saying that communism originated in the East and does not belong to the main current of democratic thought. Britain's human rights standards are higher than those of the East, so its living standards are also higher than those of the East. The British people should recognize that Britain is determined to maintain its way of life. Attlee also said that most of those who accuse the United States of trying to bully Europe are communists or communist sympathizers. These people do not want Europe to restore its sound foundation, but rather see Europe fall into a state of poverty, making it easier for people to accept communism. The British people trust their own democratic socialism and will never accept communism.

### British Troops to Withdraw Completely from the Holy Land Before the End of the Month

### Four Demands from Private School Teachers' Petition: Sitting and Waiting in Front of the Education Bureau; Seeking Solutions with Authorities Again Today

[Our Own Report] Yesterday afternoon, private primary school teachers petitioned the Education Bureau regarding loan funds and rice rations. By 9 PM, about two to three hundred people had gathered, sitting in the rain along the area of Lin Sen Middle Road and Ma Dang Road, singing, shouting slogans, and declaring that they would sit and wait until dawn. As of 3 AM this morning, they had not yet dispersed. The police were on strict alert, and fortunately, no incidents occurred. It is reported that the teachers will send representatives to meet with the Mayor, Speaker, and Director Li again today to discuss a solution.

On the other hand, the Private School Principals' Association sent representatives to the Municipal Council to petition at 5 PM. In addition to being received by councilors, Mayor Wu personally met with them and stated that the private primary and secondary school teachers and staff jointly requested a government loan of 120 billion yuan. The Four Allied Bureaus have not yet approved it, but the Municipal Government has decided to have the Municipal Bank provide an advance loan of 40 billion yuan, with the remainder to be issued after formal approval. As for the May and June rice rations, the Civil Affairs Bureau has been instructed to issue them before the 30th without fail. The representatives expressed satisfaction and then departed.

### Visiting the Education Bureau Director: Unwilling to Reveal Names

The "Shanghai Private School Teachers' Petition Group for Reasonable Living," which has been holding its ground in front of the Education Bureau since yesterday and has not dispersed as of this morning, initially gathered just over a hundred people. It was at 3 PM yesterday that they petitioned the Education Bureau. Leading the way was a cloth banner with a galloping horse, symbolizing prices. Behind the horse, "3 million yuan" was written, representing salary, and below that was a slogan: "Prices are galloping every day, teachers can't make ends meet." They made four demands to the Education Bureau: (1) A 10 million loan to be issued before the end of June, to be enjoyed by all current teachers and staff. (2) Special rice rations for May and June to be issued before the end of June, with good quality and sufficient quantity. (3) Rice rations from July to September to maintain the original price, and one peck of household rice will not be returned. (4) Additional subsidies for private schools this semester (the current subsidy is 130,000 yuan per person). More than ten representatives were sent to see Director Li of the Education Bureau. First, they were received by Director Zhu of the National Education Department. The representatives insisted on not writing down the names of the schools or the names of the representatives. Director Zhu insisted that they sign their names before he would convey their message to Director Li. The representatives firmly refused, and the stalemate lasted for more than 30 minutes. The representatives then withdrew, and more than 100 people outside the door sang and shouted slogans. Later, Director Li agreed to meet with the representatives who refused to sign their names. The representatives described the plight of primary school teachers, and Director Li expressed his sympathy. However, regarding the loan and rice ration issues, representatives of the Primary School Teachers' Association were already at the Municipal Council awaiting Mayor Wu's reply. As for the issue of private school teacher salaries, it should be the responsibility of the board of directors and the principals. However, standing on the position of safeguarding education, he would try to find solutions within the possible range for everyone's living difficulties. The representatives withdrew at around 6 PM. The petitioning crowd outside the door felt that the response was unsatisfactory and remained in a stalemate.

### Rejecting Tai Shuangqiu's Persuasion

After 9 PM, private school teachers who heard the news arrived one after another, totaling two to three hundred people, and wrote slogans on the walls of the Education Bureau and the road with chalk. At around 10 PM, Tai Shuangqiu, a figure in the education community, arrived and persuaded them to go back, saying that he had visited the authorities and that solutions for each of their demands would be sought tomorrow (i.e., today), but he was rejected by them. At 10:40 PM, Chief Inspector Zhang Wei of the Police Bureau and Chief Chen Zhiqing of the Songshan Road Police Station arrived and repeatedly persuaded them, and notified the crowd at the scene that the Municipal Council had already decided that before the National Bank allocated funds, the Municipal Bank would first allocate 40 billion yuan, and each person could receive 2.6 million yuan. The petitioning crowd expressed dissatisfaction, saying that they were asking for a loan of 10 million yuan, but now they could only get 2.6 million yuan, which was too far off.

At around 11 PM, Jiao Tong University and other schools came to comfort them with flags. There was a red steel flag with the words "Persistence Guarantees Victory" written on it. It circled around once, and applause broke out wherever it passed.

### Promising a Solution Today: The Crowd Still Refuses to Disperse

At around 12 AM, Tai Shuangqiu visited Pan Yichang, and Speaker Pan told him: "This matter is not difficult to solve. As long as there is a reason, it can be discussed. Tomorrow (i.e., today), private school teachers will send ten representatives to the Municipal Council to discuss this matter in order to find a proper solution. However, if there are more than ten representatives, they will not be received." Tai immediately told the crowd at the scene about this, but the crowd still sat on both sides of the road, unwilling to disperse. As of 3 AM this morning, they were still in a stalemate.

### Railway Bureau Will Raise Prices Next Month: Income Cannot Cover Expenses

[Our Own Report] Due to the continuous and drastic increase in prices in the past month, the income from passenger and freight transport of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau cannot cover its expenses, and the red figures are rising in a straight line. The bureau held a bureau affairs meeting yesterday to discuss ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and decided that all railway, vehicle, and miscellaneous materials, regardless of whether they are urgently needed, will be temporarily suspended from purchase for one week. At the same time, a materials usage review committee composed of Deputy Director Zeng Shirong and six others will be organized to avoid waste.

It is expected that it can be realized in early next month.

### The Living Index Will Be Published Monthly Starting Next Month: The Calculation Method of Rice and Coal Will Be Changed Again: Striving for Unified Precision and Accuracy

[Our Own Report] Regarding the proposal of the General Labor Union to compile and publish the cost of living index twice a month, the Social Affairs Bureau held a meeting yesterday to discuss it. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, Statistics Director Zhang Zongmeng of the Municipal Government, and Shui Xiangyun, Ye Xianggao, Zhang Zhusan, Fang Rusheng and more than ten others from the General Labor Union attended the meeting. As a result of the consultation, it was decided that starting next month, the cost of living index will be published on the 15th and 30th. The past practice of investigating once every Wednesday will be changed to twice every Tuesday and Friday. The calculation methods of rice and coal prices will be fundamentally changed to strive for precision and accuracy. Director Wu also called Mayor Wu to request approval of this decision.

Director Wu, because of the recent sharp increase in prices, specifically ordered the Statistics Office to re-statistically analyze the recent price increases, and strive for the accuracy of the index, in order to avoid unnecessary losses to workers.

[Another News] It was also resolved at yesterday's meeting that the distribution of coal to industrial and occupational workers in the city will be suspended starting this month, and the coal price in this month's index will be calculated at market price. Also, the distribution of rice to workers in February of this year will be supplemented by 50,000 dan of rice allocated by the Civil Affairs Bureau at the request of Director Wu, and each worker will receive approximately one peck of rice.

### Warning to Profiteers: Money or Life? Military and Police Authorities Seek to Suppress Prices: Suggesting the Most Severe Measures; No Coexistence with Degenerates of Ethnic Minorities

Recently, prices in the city have risen to unprecedented levels, especially the black market for gold banknotes, essential goods for people's livelihood, and stock speculation. The local military and police authorities are responsible for maintaining law and order and cannot remain silent. On the morning of the 28th, Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu invited the heads of the army, navy, and air force agencies in Shanghai and the constitutional police authorities to an emergency meeting on the third floor of the Garrison Headquarters to discuss sanctioning speculative merchants and suppressing prices. Bai Chang of the Wusong Fortress Command, Dong Muzeng of the First Naval District, Wang Weimin of the Air Force Supply Command, Chuan Zhengmo of the Shanghai Garrison District Command, Yu Shuping, Chief of the Police Bureau, Cai Longren, Chief of the Ninth Regiment of the Military Police, Fang Maokai, Second Brigade Commander of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army, and the Chief of Staff of the Port Command, and dozens of others all agreed that most of the factors contributing to the rising prices in the city were man-made. The military and police, carrying out the sacred task of suppressing the rebellion and protecting the people, do not allow speculative merchants to hoard materials, raise market prices, harm people's livelihood, and shake the foundation of the country. It is necessary to use armed forces to assist the deficiencies of the administration and save the crisis that is about to collapse across the board, so as to ensure the early success of suppressing the rebellion and the timely establishment of a fair and reasonable social system. It was decided that: (1) Daily necessities for people's livelihood will be fully rationed, (2) The black market for gold banknotes will be absolutely prohibited, (3) Speculation and manipulation will be thoroughly eliminated, (4) Price increases will not be allowed to continue, (5) Warehouses will be inspected and materials controlled, (6) Trading houses will be monitored and finance controlled. The generals present also put forward two warning slogans: "Choose money, don't choose life" and "Choose life, don't choose money" to tell speculative merchants. In addition to submitting the above opinions to the government for immediate implementation, they will continue to study specific implementation methods, and be prepared to take direct action when necessary. Finally, it was solemnly decided that there will be no coexistence with degenerates of ethnic minorities. Even if they escape to Hong Kong, they will not be safe. As for legitimate merchants and production enterprises, the military and police will still provide practical protection with their past loyalty.

### Martial Law May Be Reimposed in This City

Another report. Prices in the city have been soaring and skyrocketing in recent days, and the Communist bandits are seizing the opportunity to move. In order to ensure the security of the city, the Songhu Garrison Command may reimpose martial law. It is expected that the overall war system implemented in Central China will be implemented in the Songhu area earlier. If the overall war system is implemented, politics, economy, and military will become one, and these speculative profiteers will have nowhere to hide.

### The Control Yuan Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Investigate the Causes of Price Increases

Yesterday, according to reliable sources, the Control Yuan believes that the recent surge in prices in Shanghai must be due to man-made factors. It has specifically sent a member of the Control Yuan to Shanghai to investigate, so as to provide a reference for deciding on suggestions to the government to correct the price situation. A member of the Control Yuan told a reporter from the East China News Agency that the Control Yuan General Assembly had submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan to correct prices, and it is currently awaiting a factual report.

### The Transport Management Committee Adjusts Oil Prices: All Parties Express Dissatisfaction

The prices of gasoline, diesel, and fuel oil were approved for adjustment by the Transport In and Out Management Committee yesterday. The new prices are as follows: (1) Gasoline adjusted to 820,000 yuan per gallon, (2) Light diesel 130,070,700 yuan per ton, (3) Medium diesel 124,695,000 yuan per ton, (4) Heavy diesel 100,665,700 yuan per ton, (5) Fuel oil 91,625,000 yuan per ton. According to the person in charge of the Transport Management Committee, the main reason for this adjustment is that the exchange rate for oil imports continues to rise, which affects import costs. However, all parties are quite resentful of the committee's repeated adjustments of prices without focusing on unblocking sources and resolving panic. The new prices have been implemented by major oil companies and gas stations in the city since yesterday, and black market prices have also secretly risen to 900,000 yuan per gallon since yesterday.

### Checking Warehouse Inventory: Report Required Within Three Days

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Sends Personnel to Take Back the Guo Qing Ship

[Our Own Report] The Guo Qing Ship was originally the Sao Hua Ship, renamed from an enemy property, with a total tonnage of 542 tons. After the victory, it was taken over by the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau and handed over to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for agency, which leased it to Fo Heng Company to travel the Sichuan River. The bureau repeatedly wanted to take it back, but was rejected. Recently, it was heard that the ship had been sublet by Fo Heng Company to the China Import and Export Company and continued to sail the Shanghai-Chongqing line. Now the Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau wants to take it back from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, so the bureau has sent a document to the Maritime Administration Bureau. It happened that the ship was now in Shanghai, docked at the Guanqiao Wharf in Nanshi to load cargo and was about to sail to Chongqing. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent personnel to receive it together with personnel from the Maritime Administration Bureau. As for whether the goods already loaded on the ship can still be transported to Chongqing, or unloaded and returned to customs, it was not decided yesterday.

### The Chairman of the Round Woodworking Union Suddenly Disappears: More Than 200 Workers Petitioned Yesterday

Workers in the city's round woodworking industry, because their request to cancel wage discounts was not accepted by the employers, began a strike last weekend. Yesterday, after mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, the employers expressed acceptance of canceling the 85 and 86 level discounts, and agreed to consider and reply to the restoration of the current month's index-based wages. Unexpectedly, during the mediation, more than 200 workers in the industry went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, claiming that Zhao Fuyang, the chairman of the union, had declared his disappearance, and requesting a thorough investigation. At that time, personnel from the Second Department of the bureau received them, persuaded the workers to disperse, and promised to investigate the facts before handling the matter.

It is also learned that 17 members of our World Games delegation's basketball team will be taking the first flight of this route to go abroad.

### Tragedy in the Bund Park: Visitors Gather to Watch and Sigh: Flesh and Blood Enduring Separation: Abandoning Children Only Because of Poverty

[Our Own Report] A light drizzle was falling in the sky. At 6:15 in the evening, there were only dozens of visitors sparsely scattered in the Bund Park. Suddenly, a child's piercing cry came from beside the goldfish pond at the park entrance, and soon attracted a crowd of people.

This was a not-so-clean child, about four years old, with brownish-yellow skin, wearing a floral cloth skirt, barefoot, and wearing cloth shoes. Presumably unable to speak, she was just crying sadly. In her hand, she was holding more than a dozen sugar peanuts. "I don't know whose child this is, but she's a pretty good child," said a woman wearing a black Xiangyun gauze dress. "I guess she's lost," someone interjected.

But a gardener found a small note on the child's back. Although the handwriting was not beautiful, it was written quite neatly. I stepped forward to take a look, and it was a few sentences like this: "This is a pitiful girl. She is four years old this year. Because her biological father has been unemployed for four years, and her biological mother has abandoned her, there is no way out. I hope that benevolent gentlemen will pick her up and support her to end her remaining life." There was no name below, and of course, there was no address.

The gardener picked up the child. The child was still crying non-stop. Someone gave her a one-thousand-yuan Guan Jin note, but she didn't want it and threw it on the ground. "Whose child is this..." Compassionate voices floated in the air.

It was the park manager who came up with an idea: send her to the police station. Gardener No. 274 mercifully gently picked up this helpless child, left the park gate, and walked towards the Customs House, and soon disappeared into the crowd on the Jianggan side.

Do you also have children? But they don't want them anymore!

### The Legislative Yuan's Property Tax Collection Bill: The Council General Assembly Decides to Request Deferral: Requesting a Separate Draft Law for Collecting Donations from the Wealthy or Promoting Special Donations

[Our Own Report] The sixth meeting of the Municipal Council was held in its fifth session yesterday. The property tax collection bill, which was contested and unresolved at the four previous meetings, has obtained a compromise resolution. In addition, the proposals of the Finance, Public Utilities, and Police Affairs groups all obtained conclusions smoothly in a lightly depicted atmosphere.

Yesterday's meeting was delayed until 3:40 PM before it began. The first item proposed for discussion was the property tax collection bill. After the chairman summarized the four opinions on property tax expressed at the four previous meetings, he finally put forward a comprehensive opinion as follows:

"We telegraph the Legislative Yuan to suggest that it quickly draft a separate law for collecting donations from the wealthy and hand it over to the government for earnest implementation, or urge the government to strengthen the promotion of special relief donations to enrich the national treasury and meet the urgent needs of suppressing the rebellion. The collection methods of the temporary property tax law currently under review are not entirely appropriate. After consideration of the implementation, it will inevitably lead to disturbances and hinder legitimate production enterprises. There is nothing more serious than this. We should request deferral of discussion to reassure the people." Subsequently, Fan Xipin, Ye Fenghu, Zhou Lianze, Jia Dechao, and others expressed their opinions separately. Finally, the matter was put to a vote. Among the 132 councilors present, 101 raised their hands in favor of the above comprehensive opinion, which was passed by an overwhelming majority.

General Manager of the Municipal Bank Reports on Business Overview

Immediately afterward, General Manager Huang Jin and Deputy General Manager Bao Yugang of the Municipal Bank reported on the bank's business situation, respectively. The report content was divided into four points: (1) The process of resuming business, (2) Organization, (3) Business overview, (4) Past surplus figures. Regarding the business department, the bank made the following report: The main business of this bank is to facilitate citizens to pay taxes and handle the municipal government's treasury. In addition to collecting taxes and handling treasury revenue and expenditure, it also operates ordinary banking business in accordance with national policies and laws to increase income and maintain expenses. As of May, the total deposits of this bank amounted to 947.3 billion yuan, including 309 billion yuan in ordinary deposits and 638.3 billion yuan in treasury deposits. The total loans amounted to 284.5 billion yuan, including 224.5 billion yuan in loans related to municipal construction and public utilities, and 60 billion yuan in loans for cultural and news undertakings.

After the report was completed, Chu Shun raised several questions, but due to limited time, it was finally decided to submit the questioning questions and the proposals related to the Municipal Bank to the Finance Committee for review.

The Finance Committee's Resolution: Strictly Punish the Abuse of Issuing Banker's Drafts

After discussion, the remaining proposals of the Finance Committee decided to request the General Assembly to send three cases to the Gold Control Bureau for reference: (1) Please strictly stop the issuance of disguised large notes, so as to avoid stimulating prices and affecting the livelihood of the common people. (2) For banks issuing traveler's checks and abusing the issuance of banker's drafts, invisibly and disguisedly increasing the legal tender chips and devaluing the currency value, it is proposed that the Gold Control Bureau order them to stop business and severely punish them according to law. (3) It is proposed to request the Municipal Government and the Gold Control Bureau to prohibit trading houses from raising interest rates, soliciting deposits, stimulating prices, and fueling the hoarding trend. The two cases passed: (1) It is proposed to request the Control Yuan to thoroughly investigate and announce the actual situation of the Central Bank's use of foreign exchange in the past two years, and the actual situation of import and export management, in order to learn from it and seek improvement. (2) Please request the government to quickly organize and issue a supervisory committee, publicly issue the amount, and rectify the original tax revenue to balance the normal budget and sell state assets to balance the extraordinary budget. The other two cases of limiting trading houses to recover banker's drafts and strengthening securities trading were passed for retention.

### Representatives Opposing the New Tax: Visiting Various Leaders in Nanjing

[Our Own Report from Nanjing, 28th] Labor Jingxiu and twelve other representatives of Shanghai industry and commerce opposing the temporary property tax arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 28th. They first visited Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng of the Central Party Headquarters, stating the reasons for opposing the tax and asking the Kuomintang for support. Wu promised to forward the matter to the Central Political Committee for consideration. Then they visited Secretary-General Zhang Junyuan of the Legislative Yuan, asking for permission to attend the afternoon subcommittee meeting of the Finance and Finance Committee to discuss the case. Then they visited Finance Minister Wang Yunwu. Wang told them that the matter was not initiated by the Ministry of Finance, and the country needs to increase tax revenue as a fact. However, he never sang a duet with Committee Member Liu Butong. He laughed and said that if they went to the Legislative Yuan, they could learn more details and even gain something, because the power to decide this matter was actually in the hands of the Legislative Yuan. At 4 PM, the representatives attended the subcommittee meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Finance and Finance Committee on the temporary property tax and the investigation of wealthy capital, where Pan Shihao, Hu Xiyuan, and Liu Jingji reported the reasons for opposing the temporary property tax. At 5 PM, they visited President Sun. Sun said that he was the president of the Legislative Yuan and it was inconvenient to express his opinion. However, the matter was still under discussion, and he hoped that they would strive to win the sympathy of the legislators. At 6 PM, they visited President Weng. His reply was roughly the same as that of Finance Minister Wang. The Executive Yuan would look to the Legislative Yuan for guidance on this matter. At about 8 PM, the representatives attended a joint tea party of the Nanjing Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Construction Industry Association to exchange views on the matter and decided to petition the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 29th and take unified action with industry and commerce across the country.

After discussion, the original proposer requested that the original proposal be changed to temporarily postpone the abolition of the economic police brigade, but efforts should be made to improve the quality, rectify discipline, and ensure the effectiveness of the work in all aspects.

After the garbage was collected, Chairman Wu, representing the mayor, reported that: (1) The loan funds for primary school teachers originally had to be approved by the Four Allied Bureaus before they could be issued by the National Bank.

(2) The case of issuing licenses for suburban rickshaws is being discussed and studied by the Municipal Government and the Public Utilities Bureau.

### More Than 100 Proposals Remaining: It is Undecided Whether to Extend the Meeting

[Our Own Report] The Sixth General Assembly of the Council held its sixth meeting today. It was originally scheduled to hold a closing ceremony at 6 PM this afternoon. However, as of now, the proposals of the Civil Affairs, Finance, Public Utilities, and Police Affairs groups have been discussed. There are still more than 110 proposals from the Social Affairs, Mayor and Speaker's submissions, reconsideration proposals, Public Works, Land Administration, Education, Regulations, Budget and Final Accounts, and temporary motions. It will be difficult to complete all of them at today's meeting. Whether to extend the session is still awaiting the final decision of the General Assembly.

### Shipping Industry Passenger and Freight Rates to Temporarily Increase by 80% Effective Immediately; Airfares Also to Be Reasonably Adjusted

The Shipping Industry Association, citing that the original fares were difficult to maintain costs, initially resolved last week to adjust them by 80% and reported this to the Ministry of Communications. However, the Ministry has not yet responded, and as prices have continued to rise, the industry association convened another emergency meeting yesterday. They resolved that all passenger and freight fares on all routes would be temporarily increased by 80% effective immediately. At the same time, based on the most recent calculation of shipping costs, they requested the Ministry of Communications to make a reasonable adjustment.

Furthermore, regarding the fare adjustment issue of the China National Aviation Corporation, the Ministry of Communications has not yet given its approval. According to the person in charge of the CNAC: even if the fares were adjusted by 180%, it would still be difficult to sustain operations. Chinese civil aviation fares are in fact very cheap. As a comparison, the current fare from Shanghai to Beiping is 38.7 million yuan, which is only a little over eight US dollars. In the United States, one hour of air travel costs 17 US dollars. The flight from Shanghai to Beiping takes four hours, which would cost 68 US dollars. Therefore, the Chinese civil aviation industry urgently hopes that the government can fully understand this situation to make a reasonable solution, otherwise, there is the possibility of suspension of flights at any time due to difficulty in maintaining operations.

### ### Rapist of Garment Factory Worker, Liu Fangrong, Tried Yesterday

[Our Reporter] Zhang Qinlan, a sixteen-year-old female worker at the Huxi Garment Factory on Changshou Road, possessed some beauty, which attracted the attention of Liu Fangrong (age 22, from Jiangxi), a male worker at the same factory. In September of last year, Liu lured her to Zhongshan Park and the Great World for entertainment. Afterwards, he raped her at the Huatong Hotel on Jiaozhou Road, depriving her of her virginity. On December 31st, Liu tricked her into another act of rape at the Xinkang Hotel on Kangding Road. As a result, in May of this year, Zhang's aunt discovered the situation and reported it to the police station, which arrested Liu and transferred him to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Liu confessed to the above, but claimed that he had obtained Zhang's consent. However, the District Procuratorate noted that Zhang was under 14 years of age at the time of the rape, and according to the law, the case should be prosecuted as rape of a minor. Therefore, a public prosecution was initiated. Yesterday morning, Judge Xie Zhiying interrogated him in the Eighth Criminal Court and ordered a postponement for further hearing.

### ### Bloodshed on Zhongshan West Road: Maternal Uncle Conspires for Money, Robs and Chops Niece

[Our Reporter] At approximately 12:40 pm on the 26th, the Longhua Police Sub-bureau received a report that a girl had been chopped and was in critical condition near Caoxi Road on Zhongshan West Road. Deputy and Assistant Sub-bureau Chiefs Zhou Jingbo and Ji Zhonglun immediately ordered Section Chief Guo Jitian to lead officers Xu Zhenheng, Police Chief Ye Jintao, officers Chen Ronggui, Wang Liangbo, and Yang Bin to the scene to investigate the truth. They learned that the victim was Zhang Jingyan, 12 years old, who had been chopped once on the head and twice on the right arm. She was unconscious at the time. The police immediately rushed her to Zhongshan Hospital for treatment. A sharp new kitchen knife with bloodstains, a handkerchief, several hairpins, and a schoolbag were found at the scene. At around 6:00 pm in the afternoon, the injured girl Zhang Jingyan was able to speak. She stated that she lived at 337 Julu Road and her father, Zhang Qitang, runs the Wuhe Hardware Store on Beijing East Road. She was a fourth-grade student at the Tongyi Elementary and Middle School on Julu Road. At lunchtime today, Yang Jigen (see picture), the younger brother of her uncle's wife, whom she called maternal uncle, tricked her into riding a rickshaw to the countryside of Longhua. After getting off, they walked behind the graveyard, where Yang pushed her to the ground, took out a new kitchen knife, and chopped her several times. He forcibly removed the gold ring on her hand and ran away. She then lost consciousness. After listening to her statement, the police notified the girl's father to come to the station. It was learned that the perpetrator, Yang Jigen, was only 19 years old, did not have a proper job, and lived on the upper floor of Building 3 in Ruicun, Xilin Rear Road, Laoximen. Section Chief Guo urgently ordered officers Huang Lianxiang, Gao Zhiyu, Huang Ruilin, and others to investigate at various entertainment venues, ports, train stations, and other locations. At the same time, officers were selected to wait at his residence. The next morning at 8:00 am, the perpetrator indeed returned home and was arrested by the police and brought to the station for interrogation. He confessed to the crime. The sub-bureau, having clarified the case, transferred the perpetrator to the District Procuratorate for prosecution yesterday.

### Eliminating Smuggling to Benefit Industry and Commerce; Opening Up Remittance Quotas to South China; National Banks Can Stop Remittances at Any Time If There Is Market Volatility

[Our Reporter] It is reported that the financial authorities have opened up remittances to South China since yesterday. In the past, remittances to South China were limited to 50 million yuan, and anything exceeding this amount required approval. This limit has been lifted since yesterday. The purpose of this measure by the authorities is to eliminate the smuggling of cash and to benefit industry and commerce. However, to prevent price fluctuations in South China as a result, the Central Bank can consider the price and market situation and has the right to announce the suspension of remittances at any time, returning the original funds. At the same time, the previous limit of 200 million yuan on remittances from South China to Shanghai has also been lifted simultaneously yesterday.

Also, the "Regulations on the Restriction of Domestic Remittances and Cash Transportation," which was previously promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Finance, remains in effect and has not been changed. Rumors of opening up domestic remittances are not true. However, the original quota (ranging from 10 billion to 20 billion yuan per week for national banks and 1 billion yuan per day for commercial banks) for national banks to allocate funds to their peers in Guangzhou and Shanghai has now been cancelled. Any banks requesting the national banks to allocate funds for remittances handled in accordance with the "Regulations on the Restriction of Domestic Remittances" are currently not subject to geographical or numerical restrictions. This measure was stipulated by the national banks in response to repeated requests from national banks.

### Suspension of Northeast Circulating Certificates; Prices in Beiping and Tianjin Plummet

[Our Reporter, Beiping, 28th] Today, Beiping and Tianjin began suspending the exchange of circulating certificates, and prices generally fell, and the black market also stopped. Merchants engaged in receiving circulating certificates had already refused to accept them since the evening of the 26th. On the 27th, there were small transactions, with the purchase price dropping sharply to 8 yuan, and today no one is buying. At the same time, prices plummeted, especially for gold and silver. Gold fell to 170 million, silver dollars to 1.75 million, and "Bingshipowen" powder to 8.5 million, a drop of 2 million. Cloth prices remained flat, and other goods fell. It is a pity that the National Bank lowered the discount rate on short-term treasury bills to 85.2, and the interest rate was increased to two or three cents, and prices in the North are expected to remain at a small well-being in the short term as a result. However, this measure has clearly affected the established policy of the National Bank. The three important officials, Xia, Li, and Wang, in Tianjin have decided to go to Northeast China. Shi Kuiling, Director of the Tianjin Financial Management Bureau, is going with them. The North China Suppression Headquarters will have an important economic meeting this afternoon.

### New Purchases Follow One Another; Hua Shares Have a Firm Foothold

Although the environment for Hua shares was unfavorable yesterday and credit was tight again, some began to liquidate and exchange shares, so after several struggles, they were able to close with a stable appearance, and the future is already favorable.

At the morning opening, due to the large weekend recall from outside the industry, the market already called for lower prices. Yongs yarn opened at a low of 4,950 yuan, was bought up to 5,170 yuan, and then dropped to 5,070 yuan. The agency fee opened low at 76 yuan and 82 yuan, and rose to 5,230 yuan. Credit was extremely tight, and No. 106 and No. 129 sold off. Although there was a small struggle in the middle, it still fell to 5,030 yuan. The Hong Kong telegram shrank to 1.3 cents. Near noon, Tian No. 197 and others absorbed the selling and raised the price to 5,240 yuan at the close. Compared with last Saturday, after Mayar changed to small shares, there was a considerable increase. Zhongxing rose by 10%, Lian'an new shares rose to the limit, Yongs yarn, Xino, Hua Sao, Yonggong matches, and Wuhe Xinhua fell slightly, and the rest fell by 0.5% to 1%.

In the afternoon market, Yong's yarn rose to 5,350 yuan. Credit was extremely tight, and No. 164 and No. 160 sold off, falling back to 5,090 yuan. No. 89 and No. 76 and others bought in. The National Bank did not buy much, and near the close, it was raised to 5,350 yuan. At the close, it was sold to 5,310 yuan. Mayar was the only one to close at the limit. Compared with the morning close, Zhongfa remained flat, Lian'an still stood at the limit, underwear and matches fell slightly, and Hengfeng rose by 0.5%. The rest rose slightly, and the unlisted stocks outside the market showed mixed gains and losses.

Outer shares lost their outside support yesterday, and a lot of holdings poured out, causing a significant decline. Although retail investors bought in, securities firms were eager to sell. Yisha opened in the morning at 11.7 million, starting from 11.3 million. Due to the small return from the Hong Kong telegraph, it rose to 12 million near noon, but in the end it was still threatened by tight credit and fell back to the 11 million mark at the close. Compared with last Saturday, Yeguang remained flat, Wheelock Marden fell by 0.5%, Yisha English Alliance fell by 1.5%, and the remaining shares fell slightly by 20%.

Government bonds were forced down by tight credit yesterday, and the turnover was only 3 million. Category C opened in the morning at 620,000, fell to 550,000, and then stabilized slightly. Compared with last Saturday, Categories A, B, and D fell by 50,000 yuan, Unified Category C fell by 80,000 yuan, and Category E also fell slightly by 70,000 yuan.

### Hong Kong Banks' Huge Deposits; Guangzhou Financial Circles Express Doubt

[Our Reporter, Guangzhou, 28th] Financial figures here expressed deep doubts and disbelief about the Reuters Nanjing dispatch on the 25th, which stated, "Approximately 60 billion Hong Kong dollars of our hot money has flowed into Hong Kong. There are over a thousand Chinese in Hong Kong with bank deposits exceeding 10 million Hong Kong dollars, 10,000 with 5 million Hong Kong dollars, and countless with over one million Hong Kong dollars deposited in Hong Kong dollars." The 60 billion Hong Kong dollars is almost worth 12 billion US dollars, and the agency stated that this is only the figure for deposits in banks, not including those that flowed into Hong Kong without being deposited. It is feared that the hot money flowing into Hong Kong from China is not so "abundant." According to the agency's estimate, the deposits of Chinese in Hong Kong can reach 100 billion Hong Kong dollars, or 20 billion US dollars, making the number of bank issuances in Hong Kong far from being met. Therefore, it is generally believed that this news, in addition to stimulating the market and further promoting hot money to accelerate its investment in Hong Kong, is completely inaccurate.

### Exchange Settlement Certificate Fee Increased

[Our Reporter] Designated banks in the city recently decided that the handling fee for exchange settlement certificates, which was originally set at 20,000 yuan per US dollar, has been increased to 25,000 yuan starting yesterday. The market price of exchange settlement certificates rose again yesterday. When it opened at 1.5 million in the morning, no one was willing to sell. Transactions only occurred at 1.7 million. At 1.8 million, a large number of purchases were made, and the highest selling price reached 1.85 million.

### Market Conditions in Various Places

Wuxi

[Our Reporter, Wuxi, 28th] Credit is extremely tight, morale is low, arbitrage is unprofitable, and all goods have plummeted. White glutinous rice 16.39 million, white yuan 15.97 million, port indica 15.7 million, sheep indica 15.62 million, wheat 10.7 million, white wheat 10.9 million, flour 4.6 million, soybean oil 36 million, cotton yarn 630 million.

Zhenjiang

[Our Reporter, Zhenjiang, 28th] Prices in Zhenjiang fell across the board today, and the grain market is gradually returning to normal. Secondary glutinous rice opened at 18 million, and soybean oil fell sharply. The future market price is 46 million per 100 jin, a drop of 10 million compared to yesterday morning. Cigarettes fell by about 20%, and yarn and cloth fell.

Suzhou

[Our Reporter, Suzhou, 28th] Rice prices in Suzhou fluctuated today. The market opened with 14.5 million yuan for top brown glutinous rice and 16.5 million yuan for top white glutinous rice. Retail white rice was 17 million yuan, which was filled with secondary white rice. Top white rice was difficult to purchase on the black market, and the price was around 20 million yuan.

Changshu

[Our Reporter, Changshu, 28th] Credit was extremely tight today, and prices began to fall. Top white rice was 16.8 million, bargained white glutinous rice was 15.8 million, wheat was 11.3 million, rapeseed was 14 million, and special flour was 5.3 million. There was no market for cotton yarn, but kerosene rose sharply by 1 million, and the stomach was not smooth.

### Authorities Set Price Limits; Rice Market Transactions Still Suspended; Yesterday's Flour Trading Price Was Slightly Lower

Due to the rigid regulations of the Social Affairs Bureau that food rice, cooking oil, and miscellaneous grains markets could not exceed last Friday's closing prices, and based on general predictions, prices would definitely exceed this, transactions could not proceed. Market customers were turned away, making trading impossible. The People's Mediation Committee still sold 6,000 shi of rice in the market, and prices remained the same. Sentiment was slightly weak, but retail prices remained high: white glutinous rice and thin indica rice were 20 million, and early rice was 19.5 million. Although the authorities ordered manufacturers to sell cooking oil at the limited price, there was no follow-up by the close. Miscellaneous grains could not be offered due to excessively strict restrictions by the authorities.

The price of flour was also limited to last Friday's price of 5 million, but there was no old truck and warship flour available. Due to the inspection of warehouses, foreign miscellaneous brand flour was released from households, and Lighthouse, Globe, Shunfeng, and others were all 4.98 million yuan, about 4-5,000 bags, but there were few monks and a lot of porridge. Bran was limited to 3.9 million, and there was some trading. Wheat factory prices opened in the afternoon at 6.7 million yuan.

### Bulls Liquidate, Sentiment Weakens; Yarn Prices Drop Slightly

Police Monitoring Cotton Cloth Trading Makes Sales Sluggish

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was affected by the cut-off of outside hot money, the approaching end of the sixth period, tight credit in the market, and clear sales. Furthermore, due to the thorough inspection of warehouses by the authorities and the need to register all warehouse receipts, sentiment was weak, and bulls liquidated. Forty-two-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened strong, but due to the lack of vitality in the market and very little trading, it closed at 880 million yuan, a further decrease of 20 million yuan compared to the weekend. Twenty-one-count Double Horse also decreased slightly by 10 million yuan to 700 million yuan. The remaining coarse and fine yarns showed a comprehensive weakness, generally declining by about 10%.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market was affected by the close monitoring of trading by the police, and the market showed signs of decline. The market looked flat on the surface, but the raw cotton was still scarce, and manufacturers' costs were increasing daily, so buyers and sellers stood by and watched, and trading became less frequent. Fine Longtou cloth and Sijunzi Yuanbi were not trading. In addition, Wufu fine cloth rose to 21.5 million yuan at noon, an increase of 2.5 million yuan compared to Friday. Longtou B-character and Red Wufu fine cloth also rose by 1.6 to 1.8 million yuan. The rest of the Jinlian Miaowu and Leifengta Yuanbi had many transactions, and prices were also exceptionally strong. Coarse cloth, bleached cloth, and Shilin cloth colored cloth were also profitable. Outside the market, the asking price for Longtou fine cloth was chaotic, with transactions ranging from 22.5 million to 6 million.

### Tea Market Lingering

Since the continuous soaring prices of red and green tea, the market stabilized yesterday. The reason is that although there are many who are seeking high profits, they are generally restricted by credit due to the sixth period, and there are many who come to sell. Therefore, the process showed that it was difficult to improve further. The final result was lingering. Prices did not differ from the end of last week, but as for trading, in addition to exporters still being afraid of high prices for export tea and their stomachs being congested, local and rural customers were trying to depress prices to make inroads.

### Ministry of Food Announces Newly Revised Food Collateral Loan Measures

[Our Reporter] The Ministry of Food previously formulated and implemented the "Principles and Methods for Handling Food Collateral Loans" for nearly a year. According to reports from various parties, the original methods had overly complicated procedures, and grain merchants were unwilling to apply for loans, so they were not effective. The Ministry also simplified the handling procedures to facilitate implementation. After consulting various opinions, the Ministry of Food revised the original principles and implementation methods into "Methods for Handling Food Collateral Loans," and sought the consent of the Joint Treasury for approval. Subsequently, the 365th Board Meeting of the Joint Treasury resolved to approve the amended proposal and abolish the original principles and implementation methods. In addition to responding to the Ministry of Food, the Joint Treasury also telegraphed the national banks for reference. The revised "Methods for Handling Food Collateral Loans" are listed below:

(1) The Ministry of Food has specially consulted with the Joint Treasury to formulate these methods to promote food circulation, adjust surpluses and deficits, and enrich food reserves.

(2) Grain merchants applying for food collateral loans must have the following qualifications:

1. Grain merchants who are registered and qualified in accordance with the "Grain Merchant Registration Rules" and have a grain merchant business license issued by the Ministry of Food to engage in procurement, transportation, and sales.
2. Members of the local grain industry association.
3. Those with sufficient capital and outstanding credit.

(3) When applying for collateral loans, local grain merchants should, by the local grain administration authority, together with the joint treasury sub-office or its designated bank and other relevant authorities, based on local food supply and demand, grain purchasing and transportation plans, and the speed of the collateral loan amount, submit a report to the Ministry of Food and the Joint Treasury for approval.

(4) When grain merchants apply to the national banks for collateral loans by purchasing and storing grain, the warehouse where the collateral grain is stored should be inspected and approved by the bank.

(5) All collateral loan procedures, guarantee matters, deadlines, and interest rates for local grain merchants handling food collateral loans should be handled in accordance with the regulations of the local national banks undertaking the work (if necessary, the procedures may be simplified, the interest rates may be reduced, the deadlines may be extended, and the collateral loan amount may be relaxed, taking into account the actual situation).

(To be continued)

### Concrete Agreement Reached Between China and the Philippines; the First Asian Games Will Be Hosted by China; Memorandum Drafted to Be Taken to London for Discussion; Hao Gengsheng Reports on His Trip to Southeast Asia

[Report from our newspaper] When the Seventh National Games were held in Shanghai, overseas Chinese compatriots returned to the country to participate, which was unprecedentedly enthusiastic, fully demonstrating their patriotism. During the National Games, the board of directors of the China National Sports Advancement Association passed a resolution to promote and initiate the holding of the Asian Games. The newly appointed Secretary-General of the China National Sports Advancement Association, Hao Gengsheng, then traveled to Southeast Asia, departing on the 8th of this month, first to Manila, where he stayed for nine days, then to Singapore, where he also stayed for five days, returning to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 27th. The trip lasted 20 days and the results were very satisfactory. Hao hosted reporters from various newspapers at the Municipal Gymnasium yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, reporting on the trip as follows:

Hao said: The trip had three motivations: (1) When the Seventh National Games were held, overseas Chinese compatriots not only participated enthusiastically, but the leaders of each team especially hoped that Hao could visit Southeast Asia for a tour, so it was decided after the games to make the trip to express condolences and gratitude. After the reorganization of the China National Sports Advancement Association, Jiang Lianggui was initially elected as Secretary-General, but Jiang resigned. Hao was re-elected as Secretary-General, with Jiang as Deputy Secretary-General, which made Hao feel it even more necessary to visit each of these places for inspection. (2) The historically significant Far Eastern Games were dissolved in 1934 because Japan insisted on the participation of "Manchukuo." It has been fourteen years since then, and it is deeply felt that it is necessary to reorganize the Asian Sports Federation, so the opportunity was taken to contact all parties. (3) The government only allocated US$25,000 for participation in the World Games, which was insufficient. Dr. Wang Zhengting instructed him as a representative to discuss with the overseas Chinese community, and any voluntary donations could subsidize the World Games expenses.

He was warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese compatriots in all the places he visited. This was because overseas Chinese students were deeply moved by the greatness of the motherland after returning to the country to participate in the National Games, hence this enthusiastic outpouring. Regarding the organization of the Asian Sports Federation, Chen Tangshou and he, together with the Secretary-General of the Philippine Sports Association, Yilanna, and the Director of Sports at the University of the Philippines in Manila, held a meeting. Both sides completely agreed on the principles of establishing the Asian Sports Federation and holding the Asian Games. The sports conference will be held every two years, and the games will be held every four years, interspersed with the World Games. The Philippine side also proposed that the first games should be held in China. The progress of the meeting has been drafted into a memorandum by Yilanna, which will be taken to London to discuss with representatives from Asian countries participating in the World Games, and then specific measures will be determined. Rumors about the restoration of the Far Eastern Games and the holding of the games by China and the Philippines first are completely false. The Soviet Union of Asia will be welcome to participate at that time, while Japan will be invited to participate after the peace conference and international recognition of its government. In addition, overseas Chinese in Manila, Singapore, and Indonesia have been very enthusiastic about donating to the World Games, totaling between US$25,000 and US$35,000, which will be directly remitted from each of these places to London and handed over to the World Games delegation.

### Tennis League; Union America Greatly Defeats En Pai; Union Friends Loses to Sports Union

The results of the first day of the Group A Tennis League were: Green Light defeated Zhonghua, Union America defeated En Pai thirteen to two in another match, and Sports Union defeated Union Friends eleven to four. Despite the impressive lineup of Union America, it failed to achieve a complete victory. The second pair, Li Wencheng, had not recovered from his illness for long, and Lin Baohua had not recovered from his arm surgery, so their performance was mediocre, losing one to two. Ye Guanxiong and Li Guofan did not play because their opponents forfeited. En Pai lost all three straight sets in the third, fourth, and fifth groups. En Pai's incomplete lineup greatly affected its strength. Zhang Rongcai himself decided to join Bixun.

The Sports Union defeated the home team, Union Friends, eleven to four. The fourth pair of Ma Jingyao and Huite defeated Fuma Geli and Shibento two to one, which was Union Friends' only victory.

### Whitehead's Evaluation of Dewey

— Li Ren

The late British philosopher Professor A. N. Whitehead wrote an article criticizing the American philosopher John Dewey. This article was first published in the book "The Philosophy of Dewey" in the "Library of Living Philosophers" edited by Northwestern University, USA, and later included in Whitehead's "Essays in Science and Philosophy." The title of the article is "John Dewey and His Influence." It is a short piece, less than a thousand words, but it explains Dewey's place in the history of philosophy. Therefore, it is worthwhile for us to introduce it. The following is a brief summary of Whitehead's original text.

Whitehead believes that philosophy is a broad and ill-defined discipline, but it has made many contributions to the development of human nature. Dewey's place in the history of philosophy can be placed among those who have shaped philosophical thought to suit the needs of the times. He can be compared to the ancient Stoics, Augustine, Aquinas, Bacon, Descartes, Locke, and Comte. The reputation of these people is not primarily because their particular doctrines are liked by later generations. Their reputation lies in the fact that as a result of their activities, the social systems of their times gained an enlightened momentum, enabling these systems to more fully achieve their possible lofty goals. Thanks to the Stoics, the legal tradition of Western countries could be firmly established in the Roman Empire. Thanks to Augustine, Western Christianity was able to cope with the so-called Dark Ages with a fixed rational tradition. Thanks to Aquinas, the ideal of harmonizing action, emotion, and understanding was modernized for the thirteenth century. The influence of Bacon, Descartes, Locke, and Comte on modern life is even more undeniable. Similarly, Dewey has made the same contributions to American civilization as the aforementioned admonishers. He has expressed great ideas related to the operation of the social system. The magnitude of his achievements can be estimated based on the future. For many years to come, North America will be the vibrant center of human civilization. Thoughts and actions originate from it and are based on it. We all live in an era influenced by Dewey. It is difficult to describe this era because we cannot observe it from outside of it. However, we know that Dewey is a particularly powerful American thinker. He is the main intellectual force, providing his environment with consistent purpose. Wherever Dewey's influence is clearly felt, his personality is remembered with gratitude and affection.

Although Whitehead regards Dewey's position as very high, he does not believe that Dewey's thought is ultimate, complete, or unquestionable. He believes that no system of thought is ultimate or complete. Regarding existing thought or knowledge as the ultimate and complete capacity is the arbitrary attitude of mankind. Skeptics and believers are equally dogmatists. The main dogmatists at present are scientists and skeptics. They may allow minor progress, but fundamental novelty is hindered. This kind of dogmatic common sense is the death of philosophical inquiry. We should know that the universe is infinite, and human power is limited. Dewey is never intimidated by novel ideas. However, all established systems of thought inevitably adopt a self-justifying capacity and inevitably refute the doctrines of others. Dewey is no exception. In philosophical discussions, refutation or criticism has a legitimate place. However, refutation or criticism can never become the final chapter of philosophy. Philosophy gradually progresses by introducing new ideas, broadening horizons, and harmonizing conflicts. These words are equivalent to saying that we cannot over-believe Dewey's doctrines, and we cannot arbitrarily reject new ideas because of belief in Dewey's doctrines. This is not the way to promote scholarship progress. In addition, Whitehead believes that Dewey's success lies in revealing concepts related to modern civilization, but the danger is that it can bias thought toward today's narrow scope. This danger is further increased by the prestige of modern science. We cannot be satisfied with the success of only popular concepts. Thought needs to go beyond popular concepts. This is what Whitehead calls "the adventure of ideas." In a nutshell, Whitehead praises Dewey with a warning capacity.

### Idle Thoughts on the Lake (5)

— Gu Ou

Yin and Yang

Yin and Yang are two opposites that arise simultaneously. If we must distinguish between them, then Yin should come before Yang. Let's talk about the two sexes of men and women. The opposite sexes of men and women are naturally two opposites that arise simultaneously, but in terms of the general principle of biological evolution, before there was a distinction between male and female, that is, in terms of single-celled lower organisms, the reproductive function already existed. Reproduction is a characteristic of females, so it can be seen that organisms first have females, gradually evolve, and then have males, separated from females. Females belong to Yin, and males belong to Yang, so it is said that Yin comes before Yang.

Furthermore, the evolution of living matter from inanimate matter belongs to Yin, and life belongs to Yang. This is six Yin before Yang. If we talk about death and life, there should be death first and then life. Death is not only the dissipation of life, but also the incompleteness of life. Life comes from death and returns to death. If so, it is still Yin before Yang.

Lao Zhuang said that heaven and earth and all things are born from existence, existence comes from non-existence, and returns to non-existence. Life comes from matter and returns to matter. Culture comes from nature and returns to nature. Everything is like this. If we use the Chinese concept of Yin and Yang, we should say that Yang comes from Yin and returns to Yin. The Yin-Yang sequence is not only a matter of before and after, but Yang exists dependent on Yin. Yin can exist before Yang. Yin can still exist after Yang is gone, but if Yin is gone, Yang can never exist again.

The Book of Changes uses the Qian and Kun hexagrams to represent Yin and Yang. The virtue of Qian is strength, and the virtue of Kun is compliance. Strength is movement, and compliance is also movement. Strength belongs to initiative, and compliance belongs to following. Why not say passive but say following? Because passive is when object A is pushed by object B, and following is when object A follows object B and moves automatically. Initiative and following are both automatic, only one is before and one is after. As for passive, it is not automatic, but only moved by others. Now, in the natural world, from beginning to end, there should only be following movement, and no initiative movement is seen. Or it can be said that there is only automatic, and no other movement that dominates this movement or produces this movement. A follows B, B follows C, C follows D, D follows E, and so on to infinity, interconnected, pushing each other away, unable to find a starting point, unable to find a master brain. Everything follows, everything has no self-nature. In other words, it is everything natural. If you want to find a master brain in nature, if you want to determine a starting point, then that is the religious creationist theory of God, and you will never be able to jump out of his circle. Otherwise, nature is just nature, following movement is just following movement, one next to the other, one layer next to the other, without a head, without a brain, this is called infinity. Infinity is without beginning before, and without end after. No one can claim anyone else. If so, then all following movement is equal to immobility, so it is called stillness. Chinese Taoists have seen this point clearly, so the sixty-four hexagrams begin with Gui Zang. All things originate in Kun and return to Kun. Gui Zang is the ultimate and the most original. But if you name the Kun hexagram the original hexagram, then it teaches people to think that everything movement has a first beginning. If there is a first beginning, then this movement is definitely not following movement but must be originating movement. Then please ask, who is the one who masters this movement? There should be no initiative movement in the natural world. All movements are following movements, so connoisseurs do not call the Kun hexagram original, but call it Gui. Moreover, Gui Zang is not annihilation or completion. Some people think that life evolves from the material world, humans evolve from the living world, and culture evolves from humans, as if it is gradually evolving, never ending. I don't know that everything evolving still returns to nature. You cannot move forward even one step. Taoists have elaborated on this meaning, so the Kun hexagram is named Gui Zang and is designated as the first hexagram of the sixty-four hexagrams. Confucians do not advocate nature but promote human culture. Speaking of humans, humans evolved from the natural world, the living world, and the animal world, and evolved a profound culture from humans. What is different between human culture and nature is mainly that it has an initiative movement. Evolving from nature to human culture is evolving from following movement to initiative movement. Let's take the two sexes of men and women as an example. Before single-celled organisms were divided into male and female, there was only ceaseless reproduction in the living world. The ceaselessness of this life will and its perpetual forward movement really had a little initiative spirit, intruding into the realm of following movement in the natural world. It should be said that this little initiative spirit has been brewing and producing from within the realm of following movement in the natural world for a long time. But that little originating spirit of ceaselessness and perpetual forward movement is not clear, not vigorous, and still has more meaning of following movement and less meaning of initiative movement. In other words, it still does not escape the natural posture. Since males were divided from females, male masculinity represents more initiative. And female femininity only represents more compliance. Since there is male masculinity, the initiative form of life will is clearer, more vigorous, and more intense. This is a major evolution in the living world. We might as well say that the natural world is characterized by following movement, and the human world is characterized by initiative movement. The great principle of human evolution lies in striving for initiative. Confucians discuss people from the perspective of people, so they take the Qian hexagram as the first hexagram. In terms of the natural world, Yin comes before Yang. In terms of the human world, Yang should come before Yin, striving for initiative to dominate all the following movement in the natural world. But human initiative also evolved from natural following movement, and it has a limit. The final destination must still join nature. Confucians know this layer deeply, so in the six lines of the Qian hexagram, the first line says "hidden dragon, do not use," the top line says "arrogant dragon has regrets," and it also says "a flock of dragons without a head is auspicious." These are all to not violate the great law of following movement in the midst of striving for originating movement. On the road to creating cultural avenues, it is still necessary to not deviate from the laws of nature. If Xunzi's so-called conquest of nature is not the spirit of Confucianism.

Yin and Yang also represent gentlemen and petty men in the human world. According to the above theory, gentlemen are produced from among petty men, they still exist dependent on petty men, and finally they must return to petty men. Just like culture arises from nature, and culture must still return to nature. Therefore, petty men can intend to oppose gentlemen, but gentlemen always intend to lead petty men, and never oppose petty men. Petty men can intend to harm gentlemen, but gentlemen always intend to protect and nurture petty men, and never harm petty men. Gentlemen are produced from among petty men. To put it in simple terms, it is like flowers blooming on a tree. The tree can do without flowers, but flowers cannot do without the tree. Nature can do without culture, but culture cannot do without nature. Similarly, nature can destroy culture, but culture can never destroy nature. But humanists still regard culture as important and gentlemen as their responsibility.

### Random Talks from the Academic World (28)

On People

The Englishman Russell believed that the attitudes of brilliant minds towards society at the time could be roughly divided into three schools: the Constructionist school, the Radical school, and the Pessimistic school. The Constructionist school creates history, views individuals as members of society, and deeply believes that to enhance personal interests, nothing is better than dedicating oneself to public happiness. They are rich in entrepreneurial spirit, believing that there is much to be done in the world, and filled with optimistic and active attitudes. The key to their success lies in being able to know the past and the present, using reason as a guide, and applying it to various practical problems. Their study of ancient doctrines is neither worship nor belittlement, but a kind of understanding sympathy, which is the so-called critical spirit. The answers to any questions obtained by the ancients are by no means completely flawless and permanently unchanging. Regarding the ancients' arguments, one must study why they seem to be like truth. Knowing the past is like this. Generally, people who first propose a new concept are often too far removed from the times, and contemporaries regard them as foolish, so they are mostly unknown and soon forgotten. Later, when the time is ripe, some outstanding individuals emerge. Great figures in history known for new ideas are often second-hand derivatives of their predecessors. But their greatness lies in their ability to recognize the times and detect where the seeds they sow can blossom and bear fruit. Knowing the present is like this. The American New Deal, the British Labour Party, Sun Yat-sen, and Gandhi all belong to this school.

The Radical school is further divided into two branches: the Romantic Movement and the Materialist Conception of History. The Romantic Movement emphasizes emotions and tends to extremes. Russell believes that emotions are easily revealed and easily lead to trouble, while reason is profound and difficult to achieve. Emotions are individualistic, while reason must be shared with others. Emotions only care about the present, while reason must consider the future. The Romantic Movement originated with Rousseau. From today's perspective, Rousseau's theories appear to advocate democracy, but in reality, they often promote totalitarian states. Russell particularly criticizes Nietzsche's theories, stating that in Nietzsche's view, Lincoln is inferior while Napoleon is great. They only have universal hatred and fear in their minds, without universal sympathy and love, and do not know that the world is built on benevolence. Nietzsche's theories can be said to be a dead end. The demise of Nazi Germany is clear proof. Russell and Dewey both traveled to Soviet Russia. They both disagree with Marx's materialist conception of history, considering it close to theology, and disagree with violent revolution, believing it will lead to dictatorship.

The Pessimistic school is deeply disappointed with the real world and lacks the self-confidence to save the world. They wander without direction, with more fear than hope. Since they consider reform impossible, they do not want to actively do good, but only want to escape disaster and cultivate themselves. Pessimistic thoughts can be divided into four schools: the Protest school, the Skeptical school, the Hedonistic school, and the Ascetic school. The Protest school is misanthropic, deprecates everything, and believes that nothing in the world is satisfactory, ultimately becoming numb and indifferent. The Skeptical school is self-consolation for lazy people, taking ignorance as knowledge, floating along with the tide, without any achievements. The Hedonistic school considers themselves superior to those who act in plays, retreating from the world and seeking pleasure, but their flaw is ignorance of current affairs, and indifference leads to national ruin. The Ascetic school suppresses all emotions, with hearts like withered wood and dead ashes, only seeing gain and loss as floating clouds. The above schools have a common point, which is individualism and determinism, resulting in watching destruction without knowing how to build. Pessimistic thought is not the guiding torch, but the embers after the wheels have passed. This is a pathological state of chaotic times. Great philosophers in the East and West all hold optimistic and active attitudes, taking building the country and governing the world as their responsibility.

### Aristotle on Potentiality and Reality

— Ziqiang

Aristotle, on the one hand, acknowledges the so-called form and matter, and on the other hand, argues that both form and matter are within individual objects, so he must find a way to connect them. This method is the principle of potentiality and actuality that he discovered. He believes that the formation of an individual object is merely an action of matter from potentiality to reality. The first condition is matter and form, and the second condition is a dynamic principle: potentiality and reality.

Having only form does not count as existence, nor does having only matter. It is only when form is realized in matter that it counts as existence; principles cannot exist alone, facts cannot exist in isolation. Principles must have facts to confirm them, and facts must have principles to connect them, for there to be talk of existence, and at the same time, to be the object of knowledge—learning. But how is form realized in matter? How do facts confirm principles, and how do principles connect facts? Here, the function of potentiality and reality comes in. The process from potentiality to reality is an active development. Not only is it an active development, but it is also a teleological development. How so? Potentiality is latent, and ability is possibility. Since there is latent possibility, then what is lacking is only reality. Before an individual object is formed, it already has the tendency to become what it will be in the future, and what it will be in the future is the purpose. The function of reality is only to promote the realization of this tendency. Within matter, there is originally the potential to form a certain individual object. The path from this potentiality to reality is a necessary one, because there is a predetermined purpose there beforehand.

Aristotle's doctrine, viewed from a static perspective, equates the individual object with existence, which is an extremely crucial point. Viewed from a dynamic perspective, the principle of potentiality and reality is also extremely crucial. For example, in metaphysics, the entire existence—the universe—is formed by countless individual objects from potentiality to reality; in physics, various phenomena are also manifestations of potentiality to reality; in psychology, personality is the result of the development of physiological, psychological, and other states from potentiality to reality. By analogy, the principle of potentiality and reality is universally applicable.

Aristotle's principle of potentiality and reality, at first glance, seems to be the same as the principle of evolution in modern times, but in fact, they are very different: (1) Aristotle's evolution from potentiality to reality has a predetermined purpose, while the evolution of evolutionism does not speak of purpose. In other words, it does not embrace a philosophical view of purpose, but instead carries a bit of a scientific mechanical view. (2) Aristotle only speaks of the evolution of individual objects, not the evolution of species. For example, from sperm to cell, from cell to small ape, from small ape to large ape, these stages are the evolution allowed under Aristotle's principle of potentiality and reality. As for the evolution from ape to human, this kind of evolution is not allowed by Aristotle, but it is the so-called evolution of evolutionism; in other words, Aristotle's evolution is just the meaning of one thing achieving the most appropriate state, and the transformation from ape to human is not the realm that the ape should reach, so he views it as an abnormal development, an anomalous state. (3) Since Socrates, logical argumentation has become the central problem in Greek philosophy. Aristotle originally wanted to break away from this scope, but unconsciously, he was greatly constrained by it. Even when discussing the principle of potentiality and reality, he could not get rid of it. The realm of potentiality is matter, the realm of reality is form, and form is the purpose that matter tends towards. This purpose is the standard of utmost appropriateness, most suitability, extreme completeness, and extreme perfection—in this way, it carries an ethical flavor. The evolution of evolutionism from one stage to another, the so-called other stage, is not the purpose of the previous stage, and has no ethical flavor. In other words, there is no goal of utmost appropriateness, most suitability, extreme completeness, and extreme perfection.

Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

### Husband Doing Business Elsewhere Wife Immoral Mortgages Ancestral Property

Shui Yunheng asks Mr. Pien Zhe: Zheng Ren has several legal questions and hopes to receive answers in your column.

I and my brother jointly own an ancestral house. We each received a deed from our late father, with my brother living in the east wing and me living in the west wing. I have been working in Shanghai since I was young. In the 28th year of the Republic, the house was mortgaged by my sister-in-law to a Mr. Ni (my brother was also working elsewhere at the time). Eight years have passed since then. Recently, I learned that Mr. Ni's son is also in Shanghai. When I went to negotiate, the other party only said that they have a deed to the house and that if I want to move out, I must repay the previous mortgage amount (calculated according to the price index).

My sister-in-law passed away last year, making the process even more difficult. I would like to ask: (1) If the property has a deed of division but has not been transferred, does my sister-in-law have the right to dispose of it without my consent? (2) If the contract held by the other party is not signed by the owner, is it legally valid? (3) If the other party extorts a large amount of compensation, how should I respond? (4) If the other party refuses to concede, can I sue according to the law? (5) Can matters in other provinces be sued in the Shanghai court, and will the court accept it? (6) I am unable to hire a lawyer. How should I sue? (7) If I lose the case and cannot afford all the litigation costs, what will be the consequences? (8) Because my workplace does not allow me to take leave, and the Shanghai court does not accept the lawsuit, what should I do?

[Answer by Lawyer Chuan Kuangsu] (1) If a jointly owned property has been divided, and the certificate of the jointly owned property has not been changed for the rights registration, and a third person mortgages the jointly owned property, then of course it is unauthorized disposal. (2) Invalid. (4) There are no clear provisions in the law. Possible. (5) Impossible. (6) You can apply to the original county's bar association for pro bono assistance. (7) After the judgment is final, the winning party can apply to the court for a ruling that the losing party pay the litigation costs. (8) You can entrust an agent to file a civil lawsuit with the original county's local court.

### Reader's Mailbox

Pan Junjun: Regarding the procedure for obtaining an ID card, please inquire with the Bao Office.

Yu Huamin, Hu Rongxin: Your letters have no address and have been filed after inquiry. No reply.

Sun Yongchun: Your letter has been forwarded to the Shanghai Military Service Association, which replied that if what you stated is true, you can postpone conscription. After review, the association will issue a public notice to the relevant district.

Wang Renda, Liu Quande, He Naiyan, Ma Tianxiao, Wang Quansheng, Wang Heming, and the Funing Natives Association in Xiyi: Your letters have been forwarded to the relevant authorities for review.

Wang Shangde, Zhu Dashi from Pudong: Regarding your inquiries, I believe that you should seek medical diagnosis and take medicine according to the doctor's prescription. Even if the description of your illness in the letter is extremely detailed, it is still not as accurate as seeing it in person; and the exchange of letters takes time, and the illness may change. If I were to answer based on that, it would be difficult to ensure accuracy, so asking about illness through correspondence is not a proper method. Furthermore, over-the-counter medications and so-called secret recipes should not be tried rashly, lest they delay the opportunity for treatment.

To a Reader: A reader, Mr. Bao, recently requested the April 3rd and May 7th issues of this newspaper. I am grateful for your willingness to part with them. I have already forwarded them to Mr. Bao and would like to express my gratitude here!

### On Thrift

— Wu Yong

If the rich hoard wealth and do not use it, then the poor will have no way to make a living.

This saying is correct. For example, if a young master spends a little money on dancing, so that the dancers can make a living, it is still a way to facilitate economic circulation.

Therefore, some people infer that the more wasteful things are, the better, saying that waste has the effect of averaging wealth and relieving unemployment. In fact, if the averaging of wealth and the relief of unemployment rely on wasteful means to achieve, thinking carefully, the matter is extremely sad.

During the New Economic Era implemented by American President Roosevelt, the government spared no effort to design unnecessary construction projects to alleviate the suffering of unemployed workers. However, the source of workers' suffering lies in not having income, not in not having work to do. If the goal is to relieve the suffering of workers, then simply giving money to the workers would suffice. Why build unnecessary projects, which both harm wealth and burden the people? If workers are afraid of not having work to do, they can simply move broken bricks and rubble from outdoors to indoors. If they feel it is not enough, they can even move them upstairs, and then move them back down, move them outdoors, and move them repeatedly, imitating what Tao Kan did.

The way to solve the unemployment problem must not rely on waste, creating something from nothing and artificially adding positions. "Labor is not the best gift that employers can give to workers. Hard work, toiling and sweating, is not a pleasant thing in itself. In today's civilized century, reducing this kind of hard work is the right thing to do."

Labor itself is not the ideal goal of life; waste cannot benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. If the words of the proponents of waste were true, then to take them to the extreme, we should devote ourselves to destruction, "because construction comes after destruction." We must first do the work of destruction, and then everyone can be bustling and lively, with work to do and food to eat. Accordingly, bandits are the benefactors of the police; without bandits and villains, what use are the police? Socialites who spend lavishly on living expenses and are ashamed to be seen wearing the same dress twice should be considered meritorious figures in supporting a country's production. To extend this further, we may as well break all the window glass in the room, leaving not a single piece intact. In this way, glass manufacturers will not be forced to close down, and with the prosperity of their business, factories will expand and workers will be added, unemployment will be reduced, and production will increase. The construction of new factories and the purchase of new equipment will affect and promote other industries, and promote the industrialization of the whole country. According to this, healthy people must be made to get sick, and sick people must be made to die early, so that the medical profession can flourish and the undertakers' doors can be filled with customers.

What is strange is that the proponents of such waste are often the same people who are doing their best to advocate thrift in other areas. Today, some people, when it comes to education and cultural undertakings, immediately say that funds are tight and they are trying to economize. Thus, in the face of large-scale waste, education and cultural undertakings are the first to suffer the disaster of "thrift." In my opinion, even if we are determined to work hard on waste, we should develop it evenly, and everyone should give a large-scale endorsement, including education and cultural undertakings. Today's situation makes people feel that things that should be economized are being wasted as much as possible, and things that should not be spared are the first to be economized. Whether in ancient or modern times, whether in China or abroad, in the midst of the call for waste, the good things are always the first to be removed.

In the past, totalitarian countries, in order to solve domestic unemployment and dissatisfaction, did not hesitate to launch foreign wars of aggression to divert the people's attention. These examples seem laughable at first glance, but then they cannot help but make people sigh and throw down their pens.

### North and South Weather

— Zizi

In the early years of the Republic of China, there were two students in the Baoding Military Academy who were very friendly. One was named Xue, a native of Hebei, and the other was named Lou, a native of Jiangnan. The two lived in the same room, ate at the same table, traveled together, and rested together, inseparable. They were like this for several years. On the day of graduation, they promised each other to serve the country faithfully, and made a reservation that if one of them became successful in the future, he would definitely do his best to promote the other. Then they parted ways. Lou went south to Jiangsu, and Xue continued to seek development in Hebei. Before long, Lou became successful, repeatedly promoted. Before long, he became a brigade commander, famous for a time. Xue was down on his luck, so he packed his bags and went south to seek a position. When he arrived in Nanjing, Lou personally came out to greet him, treated him warmly, and personally accompanied him at every meal, treating him like an honored guest, but he never discussed seeking employment. Xue repeatedly inquired, but was rejected. One day, Lou sent someone to deliver a note saying: "Although it is warm in Jiangnan, there is still snow." At that time, it happened to be early spring, and the winter snow in Jiangnan was gradually melting, and the homophone of "snow" is "Xue", which means that Jiangnan could not arrange a position for him. Xue was furious when he saw the note, and left without saying goodbye. He returned to Hebei and joined the army, working hard and achieving great success. Before long, he went smoothly and became a famous general. However, "the back waves of the Yangtze River push the front waves", Lou lost power because his superiors lost power, and gradually declined, barely able to maintain food and clothing. Helpless, he went north and went to Xue's house to ask for relief. Xue also treated him with the courtesy of an honored guest, fed him delicious food every day, and lived in luxurious rooms, doing everything possible to be rich and glorious, never contradicting him in the slightest, but he never mentioned seeking employment. Although Lou had plenty of food and clothing, he was fed all day long and had nothing to do. Moreover, as a military man, he was active by nature, and after a long time, he became more and more impatient. Seeing that there was no movement, he angrily resigned. Xue did not insist on staying, and held a grand banquet to send him off. Lou asked before leaving whether there was a place in the north that could be arranged. Xue only said: "My brother troubled your residence some time ago, and I am very grateful for your warm hospitality. I really feel uneasy. I have been unable to respond to the upper couplet proposed by you for a long time, but today I suddenly got the lower couplet, and I hope my brother can teach me." The lower couplet is "The high wind in the north of the fortress cannot live in the Lou house." Lou was ashamed and left.

### Waves Washing Sand

— Chen Meng'an

The riverbank was originally for selling Jiangxin sand,
The front waves and the back waves sink alike,
The wind is urgent and does not follow the mud,
Accompanied by gulls and herons waiting for the sunny sky.

The tide is long and the waves follow the wind's strength,
The sand is flat, the night is long, and the moon rises,
Fullness and emptiness originally have nothing to do with human affairs,
But people's hearts are never at peace.

The rivers and seas come from the same deep place,
Some people boil brine and pan for gold again,
The ruthless are even more bitter than the affectionate,
Toiling for thousands of years until today!

Morning after morning, year after year, spring and autumn,
The sand does not increase or decrease, and the water flows long,
Unable to bear the gulls distinguishing the new from the old,
There are also boats coming and going with the tide.

Going east and then west again,
Sometimes high and sometimes low,
Foolishly hoping there will be a day when the flow stops,
In the blink of an eye, the meaning of red mulberry is always lost.

Reciting old scores in a new way,
Who knows when it was passed down?
If you sing this song again in the years to come,
Will it not be an ancient person's poem again!

Willow branches and Waves Washing Sand are all Tang Dynasty musical poems. When sung before the banquet, their rhythm cannot be restored. Those composed by Liu and Bai are purely in Tang Dynasty style, all seven-character poems. As for those collected by Hua Jian, they cannot be called poems. However, the fact that Liu and Bai's works cannot be called lyrics, and that Hua Jian's works cannot be called poems, there is something in between that can be referred to.

### "Hearts are Delighted"

— Pingzhai

Every time I read newspaper reports about the execution of criminals, I can often find two stock phrases in the section describing the crawling: "Hearts are delighted, and the cheers are thunderous." Sometimes I can't help but think that a living person, tied up and kneeling on the ground, shivering, suddenly a loud bang behind him, and then "one shot ends his life, falling in a pool of blood." Society has executed the law enacted in the spirit of "killing for murder" - but the people who witness it actually cheer thunderously, which is really a bit like the crowd cheering around the guillotine in Dickens' writings. I think this kind of mentality is not very healthy.

Yesterday evening, I took my child for a stroll on North Sichuan Road. Suddenly, I saw a circle of people crowded on the sidewalk, and more and more people were crowding in. When I got closer, I saw a big boy wearing a sweaty shirt and shorts, sweating profusely, at most seventeen or eighteen years old, like an apprentice in a small restaurant. He found himself the object of attention of many people, and couldn't help but proudly raised his "magic weapon" - a big rat seven or eight inches long. The young man carefully tied the rat's tail tightly with a strong hemp rope, and he was holding the hemp rope in his hand.

He was smiling, and when he saw a car passing by, he immediately threw the rat vigorously towards the front of the car, but the gentleman driving the car had already caught a glimpse, frowned, and "braked" the car. The rat quickly escaped to the side with the hemp rope. The young man's interest seemed even stronger. He raised the hemp rope high again, and the rat's four feet were dangling in the air. There were more spectators all around.

At that time, I quickly took my child's hand and walked past. Just after walking a dozen steps, more than a dozen cars came along the road. Suddenly, I heard dozens of people cheering behind me. The rat's death sentence had been carried out.

I think "hearts are delighted" and "cheers are thunderous" are probably nothing more than this in reality. Everyone is really too depressed, so this breath of resentment is transformed into unparalleled cruelty, taking pleasure in watching murder and taking pleasure in abusing the weak!

After the Soviet Union decided to abolish the death penalty, the British government also had a proposal to abolish the death penalty immediately. At that time, Bernard Shaw and others also published various reasons against the abolition of the death penalty. But recently, after reading the news, the United Kingdom has finally decided to "try" abolishing the death penalty for several years first. And the American judiciary is focusing all its efforts on the work of "treating" crime. Crime is regarded as a kind of pathology, and far-sighted judges are using personality and educational power to enable criminals to get a real chance to "rehabilitate themselves." "Removing violence" is easier than "changing one's heart and face," but their "changing one's heart and face" work has achieved amazing results.

What about us? Let's not talk about anything else, "people's hearts" always have the opportunity to be "delighted".

### Zhang San, Li Si

— You Mojun

The "Zhang San, Li Si" that we often say in our speech is the same as A, B, but it refers to general people who have no relationship at all, and there is no deep meaning. As for why it must be called the surnames "Zhang" and "Li", it is because these two surnames are the most common; why it must be called "San" and "Si", it is nothing more than saying that they are miscellaneous, so there is no need to delve into it.

In the autumn of the 19th year of the Republic of China, when I was teaching in Hangzhou, I was interested in visiting the reed marsh, and I went to Xixi. I took the road to Liuxia Town and took a boat to Xixi. The boatman was an old woman. According to her, the reason why Liuxia is called "Liuxia" is because during the Hongyang Rebellion, the slaughter in that area was extremely tragic. The only ones who were fortunately preserved were the four surnames and eighteen families, namely "Zhang San", "Li Si", "Wang Wu", and "Zhao Liu"; that is, only three families with the surname Zhang were left, four families with the surname Li, five families with the surname Wang, and six families with the surname Zhao, making up the number of four surnames and eighteen families. A friend said that she was talking nonsense, and "Zhang San, Li Si" had already appeared in the "Wudeng Huiyuan". I also said that the name of Liuxia was also there in the early Southern Song Dynasty, but it's okay to listen to this kind of unofficial story!

"Wudeng Huiyuan", I don't have this book on hand, I don't know what it says in it, and I didn't ask my friend in detail at the time. According to Zhu Xi's "Classified Conversations", "Like this crowd, there is only one principle: there is Zhang San, there is Li Si, Li Si can be Zhang San, Zhang San can be Li Si." This proves that the saying "Zhang San, Li Si" and so on already existed at the end of the Southern Song Dynasty. To push it further, people were already accustomed to calling people like this in the Northern Song Dynasty, and Wang Anshi even put it into poetry. Wang's poem says: "Zhang San's trousers are narrow, Li Si's hat brim is long; do not say Zhang San is bad, do not love Li Si is good!" This poem is quite popular.

Based on the above, there are two explanations for the saying "Zhang San, Li Si". The old woman of Liuxia in Hangzhou has her own interpretation.

### Reasons for Divorce

— Jinlin

A woman in Paris is seeking a divorce from her thirty-nine-year-old husband because he is too childish. The reason is: "Since they got married, her husband has never given her Christmas presents, but insists on believing that Santa Claus will send them himself." As a result, the judge granted her request.

In Charleston City, USA, a seventeen-year-old girl is seeking a divorce from her ten-year-old husband because her ten-year-old husband is unable to support her.

In Switzerland, a deaf and mute husband is seeking a divorce from his deaf and mute wife because she deliberately pretends not to understand his gestures.

A man in Paris wants to divorce permanently, and the court has granted it. Because his wife's bedroom is hidden with thirteen statues of Buddhas as big as men.

### The Compilation of the New Chinese Map (II)

— Fang Jun

The area covered by the 1:50,000 old map grid is roughly as follows:

Hebei: About two-thirds of the entire province in the east

Henan: The entire province

Shanxi: The entire province

Shandong: The entire province

Shaanxi: The central part, about one-sixth of the entire province

Jiangsu: The entire province

Anhui: Lacking the central part

Zhejiang: The entire province

Hubei: The entire province

Hunan: The northern part and the Xiang River basin, about one-half of the entire province

Jiangxi: The northern part, about one-half of the entire province

Guangdong: The entire province

Sichuan: The Yangtze River basin east of Chongqing, about one-tenth of the entire province

Yunnan: The eastern and central parts, about one-third of the entire province

The new map grid is based on Lambert conformal conic projection. Each map sheet covers 15 minutes of longitude east-west and 10 minutes of latitude north-south. Corrected by triangulation, the map sheets are uniform and neat. Moreover, the accuracy is also higher than that of the old map grid. If we try to draw newly measured longitude and latitude points or actually measured routes into the grid, the location of various places and the twists and turns of rivers can all match the points in the map one by one. Its degree of accuracy is comparable to modern international topographic maps. The area it covers is:

Gansu: The eastern part, extending westward to the vicinity of Jiuquan, about one-third of the entire province

Shaanxi: A dozen sheets in the western part

Sichuan: The area east of Chengdu, about one-fifth of the entire province

Guizhou: Centered on Guiyang, forming a cross, with each side extending to the provincial border, about one-eighth of the entire province's area

Yunnan: The western part

Guangxi: Lacking the western part, about more than half of the entire province

Fujian: Lacking the area bordering Jiangxi, about two-thirds of the entire province

Next, the compilation of the new map will be described, and I plan to state it in three sections: materials, compilation, and clear drawing, as follows:

The topographic maps actually measured by the Chinese Survey Bureau are mainly at a scale of 1:50,000. According to their nature, they can be divided into two types, namely the so-called old map grid and new map grid. The former was measured from the early years of the Republic of China to the outbreak of the War of Resistance. Regardless of the region, the width of the map sheet is generally 46 cm horizontally and 36 cm vertically. Therefore, in the southern provinces, each sheet covers less longitude, while in the north, it covers more. Roughly speaking, each sheet covers about 13 to 15 minutes of longitude east-west, and the latitude is generally about 10 minutes. This type of map sheet is not based on projection, nor is it controlled by triangulation, so the positions of the map sheets are uneven and must be sorted out before they can be used. The Army Map Service (AMS) of the United States has thoroughly sorted out the longitudes and latitudes and triangulation results of various orders measured in my country over the years, using them as the backbone to calculate the longitude of the four corners of all map sheets. This information is extremely valuable. Without it, the compilation time would be extended by at least one year. The Shen Bao publishing house has now released it.
