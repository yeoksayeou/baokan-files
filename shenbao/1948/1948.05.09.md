Weekly Forum What after the Implementation of the Constitution? Zhu Guangqian The National Assembly has elected the President and Vice President, followed by the self-convening of the Legislative Yuan and the formation of a democratically elected government. We have formally entered the main road of constitutional government. What will happen next? The government authorities may think that this is a turning point in China's crisis. Although they dare not say that everything will be smooth sailing from now on and that the country will be prosperous and the people will be at peace, they at least hope that this is the beginning of a new effort and may gradually solve some difficulties. However, the attitude of the general public is contradictory: on the one hand, they are thinking of governance in the midst of extreme chaos and hope that the government may change its course and work hard to govern; on the other hand, in view of past experience, they also hold great doubts, thinking that the government may not have the ability and determination to make drastic reforms, and the so-called implementation of the constitution may still be a case of changing the soup but not the medicine, and cannot completely reverse the crisis. Therefore, as far as the general public is concerned, the announcement of the implementation of the constitution only arouses a vague hope and fails to establish confidence in the government. The government must win the trust of the people, not only by relying on written propaganda or political tricks, but also by showing the utmost fairness and sincerity with real evidence.

What the people urgently hope for today are two major events: First, in terms of politics, it is to clarify the administration of officials and stabilize the economy, so that society can gradually enter the right track; second, in terms of military affairs, it is to rectify military discipline and strengthen military preparedness, so that the suppression of the rebellion can be successful as soon as possible. What the government has to deal with are these two major problems. Whether it can reverse the crisis depends on whether it can find a satisfactory solution to these two major problems. If it cannot solve these two major problems, there is no big difference between implementing the constitution and not implementing the constitution. It will lose its reason for existence, and the overall collapse that the whole country is worried about will inevitably be unavoidable.

The old teaching of Chinese politics is "government rises with the survival of men". The law waits for men to act, and problems also wait for men to solve. In the past, political chaos and military defeats were mostly due to poor planning by men. They had neither the ability nor the sincerity to solve the major problem of reversing the crisis, and they spent their energy on the struggle for power. Even if there is a law, if people are not fair and sincere, the law will become a tool to facilitate personal gain. Therefore, the first test after the implementation of the constitution lies in the appointment and dismissal of officials, and in whether the government selects the most appropriate person to exercise each kind of power. We can imagine two paths. One is the only broad road, which is to eliminate the selfishness and prejudices of parties, factions, clans, and regions, and from the central government to the local government, all should select and appoint officials based on their ability to do the job, select people for the job, and not set up positions for people, so that power can be entrusted to the right person, responsibility can be assigned to the right person, and merit must be rewarded, and demerit must be punished; officials, no matter what their factions are, can only have the common goal of reversing the crisis, treating each other with sincerity, working together with one heart and one mind, and helping each other in the same boat. The other path is the wrong path that has been taken in the past and found to be impassable, that is, the parties and factions are divided, sometimes colluding with each other, sometimes excluding each other, each seeking to distribute their henchmen to important positions, only seeking to expand their territory and consolidate their power, regardless of the danger of the overall situation of the country; and the central government intends to stabilize the situation, seeking compromise, weakening this force for fear of losing support, and weakening that force for fear of causing trouble if they are pressed too hard, so they condone and tolerate them, and the promotion and demotion of officials are unfair, and rewards and punishments are unclear, officials do not get the right people, and people do not live up to their positions, until the principles of governance are swept away, and chaotic situations arise, forming the situation today.

Among these two paths, what the people urgently hope for is of course the first path, but the tendency to take the second path is more dominant, first, because this is a familiar path with less resistance; second, because the wings of each party and faction have already been formed, and they may not be willing to suddenly abandon their selfishness, and the country cannot easily cut them back. Even though the constitution has been implemented, the government may still follow its consistent style of seeking stability through compromise and patching up loopholes, and may not dare to take the first path.

Here we may as well examine the facts calmly and frankly. Today, the government has become a source of resentment, and what the people resent is the long-established trend of encroachment by a party faction. They are nominally one family but dream different dreams, each harboring ulterior motives, or using the power of their party to trample on the people's will and monopolize political power; or using the power of their military group to resist in a corner and delay military opportunities; or using the tricks of their staff and assistants to manipulate things horizontally and vertically and occupy important positions; or using their wealthy capital to manipulate finance and trade, and sucking the people's blood to enrich themselves; in addition, there are also local systems such as Guangxi and Sichuan, and friendly party systems such as the Youth Party and the Democratic League, each relying on their strength to seize a piece of the pie. In all fairness, among these factions, there are not a few capable and competent people who have made contributions to the country, but they are all wrong in one word: "selfishness", party first, country second, exhausting their intelligence and ability to the development of their own party and faction, creating imbalances and conflicts between factions, offsetting all attempts at reform or construction, and the lack of concentrated strength is the fatal flaw of all military and political measures. Secondly, the leaders of the factions may be fair and honest (and this is also a very small number), but most of their comrades are corrupt and incompetent. Since they use them as henchmen, they cannot help but protect their faults, so that right and wrong are unclear and the principles of governance are swept away. Let's take a few examples. When Taiwan was first recovered, everyone held extremely enthusiastic hopes and threw themselves into the arms of the motherland. However, less than a year after the recovery, all kinds of evils arose and complaints rose, making the country's reputation disappear without a trace. The Northeast is the throat of the country, with fertile land and abundant people. Before the recovery, bandits only appeared on the borders. After the recovery, officials were fat and soldiers were lazy, wealth was exhausted and the people were resentful, and they led wolves into the house, threatening the survival of the entire country. Who were those who were entrusted with the important task of guarding the borders! They ruined the country's major affairs, not only were they not punished, but they still held high positions and received high salaries. Another example is Anhui, the back of Central China and the screen of the capital. The people's customs have always been simple and honest. Since the Guangxi faction occupied the chairmanship, they let soldiers harass the people, drove the people to become bandits, and then raised bandits to make themselves important. The people of Anhui resented them deeply and repeatedly appealed to the central government to punish them, but the central government repeatedly ignored them. Examples like this are too numerous to mention. The reason for this is that those who are derelict in their duties and mislead the country, despite their obvious sins and the anger of the people, each have their own faction to support them, and the government is afraid of harming the mouse, so it has to condone and nurture evil. "The failure of the country is due to the evil officials"; if the principles of governance are swept away, how can the officials not be evil? How can this method of condoning and nurturing evil encourage those who can do good and warn those who can do evil? How can it appease the people's resentment and win their hearts? How can it show the dignity of the country's laws? How can it win the people's confidence in the government? The deterioration of the group has reached this point today, entirely because the principles of governance do not exist, the social atmosphere has deteriorated, and the people's hearts have been lost. To reverse this situation, we must prescribe the right medicine, which is to rectify the principles of governance, transform the social atmosphere, and win back the people's hearts. If this cannot be done, everything is empty talk!

Today is considered the implementation of the constitution. We cannot deny that this is a good opportunity to set things right. The good opportunity for the success of the Northern Expedition was missed, and the good opportunity for the victory of the War of Resistance was also missed. This time, the good opportunity must not be missed again. If it is missed, the result will only be collapse. This situation is very clear, there is no use exaggerating it, and there is no use hiding it. Every moment is critical, and we cannot but sincerely hope that the officials in power will turn their minds around. "If the skin is gone, where will the hair attach itself"? Selfishness of factions is the path to the destruction of the country, and it is also the path to the self-destruction of factions. The situation is so critical that patching up and mending is no longer helpful. There must be drastic measures to eradicate the accumulated evils and bring a new look to the public. If the virus in one arm threatens the life of the whole body, then that arm must be amputated with pain. The key to all reforms undoubtedly lies in the highest authorities. "If the ruler leads with righteousness, who dares to be unrighteous"? This old teaching is still unbreakable today. Secondly, this key also lies in the leaders of all parties and factions. They should wake up as soon as possible, thoroughly change their past style, eliminate selfishness, treat each other with sincerity, and devote all their efforts to saving the current crisis. Lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot, cling to evil and not repent, and perish the race. There is no other way to go other than these two paths. Which path do you choose? The fate of China depends on a change of heart among you. Do you want to be a meritorious official of the revival of China, or do you want to be a guilty person who misleads the country? We, the people, are anxiously awaiting this choice at the crossroads.

Low Pressure Has Left the South China Sea Solar Eclipse Can Be Observed in Kuli Shanghai's Initial Eclipse at About 9:33 AM This Morning [This City News] Starting at 9:33 AM today (summer time), Shanghai citizens can see a rare annular eclipse, second only to the total eclipse on June 19th of the 25th year of the Republic.

Before the match, basketball referee chief Shu Hongyi announced: according to the notice from Wang Lianggui, head of the competition's referee group, if any game is stopped midway due to rain or an accident, the results already achieved will be valid. Machia and the Navy had already played for 10 minutes and 30 seconds before, and the score was 13-10. Therefore, yesterday's match was a continuation of the 7th's time and score.

### Football Championship Who Are the Final Four Teams?
Police Sure to Defeat Siamese Chinese, Hong Kong-Zhejiang Trend Also Set
Shanghai Inevitably in a Fierce Battle, Army Can Defeat Machia
By Our Reporter Sang Jun
[Our Special Feature] In this All-China Games, the eight teams that have obtained the right to the football championship semi-finals will be divided into four groups today to compete for the final four places. The order of the four groups is: (1) Police vs. Siamese Chinese, 9:00 AM at the Athletics Field; (2) Hong Kong vs. Zhejiang, 9:00 AM at Yiyuan; (3) Shanghai vs. Dalian, 5:00 PM at the Athletics Field; (4) Army vs. Machia, 4:00 PM at Yiyuan.
This will determine which of the eight teams is qualified to compete for the championship and which will be eliminated. The stakes are very high, and it is expected that all eight teams will go all out. However, after reviewing the performance of the eight teams in the past few days, several conclusions can be drawn:
(1) The Siamese team is good at short passes, but rarely takes advantage of scoring opportunities, and their stamina is insufficient. The police team's five forwards have skilled footwork, and they are still full of energy in the second half, which is commendable. Compared to this, the Siamese team has already lost a step. Moreover, the police team has Zeng (Zhongyun) and Zheng (Yingquan) as defenders, who are more than capable of defending. The Siamese team's defense is relatively weak and insufficient to resist attacks. Therefore, the police team will surely defeat the Siamese Chinese in this group.

(2) In the previous match between the Hong Kong team and the Navy, although they narrowly won, they did not show their strength. They were complacent and underestimated their opponent, and it was too late when they realized their mistake. This is the biggest reason why they could not fully maintain their inherent advantage. If the team still adopts this style against Zhejiang today, they will surely repeat their mistakes. The Zhejiang team has already fought two battles, and their stamina in defeating the Philippine Overseas Chinese team 6-3 was amazing. The Hong Kong team has a natural talent, and if they use it well and avoid complacency, they can defeat Zhejiang.

(3) Although Dalian has also won two battles against the Joint Logistics and Henan teams, their winning factor lies in physical strength rather than technology. In terms of the Shanghai team's strength in rushing the line from the back, it is more than enough to resist Dalian's five records. The Shanghai team's five forwards are exceptionally strong and sharp. Although Dalian's two defenders were once famous during the "Northeast Wind" era, they may not be able to deal with them in the end. Therefore, Shanghai can defeat Dalian in this group.
Shanghai Team
Xu Fusheng
Chen Jiawan Zhang Lingen Zhuang Youren
Tang Zuowen Tan Fubai Zhang Lingen Yu Qiaxing
Li Yao Sun Jinshun Han Longhai Xia Tixian Chen Mingzhe Jia Youliang
Dalian Team
Ma Mingyi
Wang Lipin Wang Zhengwen
Li Chengxian Wang Baoshan Chen Qin
Chen Chaofu Li Chaogui Li Guanghui Zhu Yongshou Guan Chengkuan Jiang Benshen
(4) The strength of the Army and Malaya seems equal but is actually different. The Army has many famous generals, while Machia relies on newly emerging talents. Machia will inevitably suffer in terms of combat experience, but the team can rush and run, and their physical strength is better. Even if the Army can win the final victory, they may not be dominant in every aspect of the process. If Machia can restart the triangle passing method and give full play to their talent, even if they lose, they will not lose by much.

He also inspected the main traffic arteries and parking lots with the staff of the traffic team. He gave detailed instructions on vehicle control, scheduling, distribution, and parking arrangements.
### Police Department Re-Specifies Parking Locations for All-China Games Vehicles
[Central News Agency] Since the opening of the All-China Games, the continuous congestion of vehicles has made it necessary to further improve traffic order. The police department's temporary command post has taken this into account and has specially ordered the traffic team to re-specify the parking locations for various vehicles as follows: (1) Vehicles with the "Special" or "Official" pass of the Games will park on both sides of the West Commander's Stand.

### Two Scalpers Captured, 78 Thieves Arrested
[Our Dispatch] The police department has worked hard to maintain order at the Games. Plainclothes detectives alone were dispatched, totaling 150 people. The total number of people, including the newly established "Flying Fortress" of the Jiangning Road branch, was also more than 150.
As of 5:00 PM yesterday, a total of 78 people with improper behavior and theft had been arrested in the past four days. On the opening day, nine Parker pens were found on a fake soldier. Two of them had already been reported and claimed, and the rest were waiting to be claimed. Two "scalpers" selling black market tickets were caught, and a suspect selling small worker badges to lead guests into the venue was also arrested.
A student from Jingrui Elementary School was crying loudly behind the West Commander's Stand. The "Flying Fortress" inquired about the address and sent a car to take the student home.
The fire department had no incidents but focused on fire prevention. Yesterday, they notified various shops to strictly prevent electrical fires.
The security at the gate was strict, but many beggars somehow entered and begged at the entrances of various hotels.
The Taiwanese athletes marched into the stadium in orderly formations, and the audience praised this spirit unanimously.
As of the 7th, the Games had received a total of 406 prizes, including 181 championship banners, 40 silver shields, 56 silver cups, and 6 silver tripods.
The Xu Chengji Memorial Cup, donated by the entire Hong Kong branch, was all silver and worth 1,300 Hong Kong dollars.
The Shandong Provincial Government donated 20 championship banners with harmonious colors and exquisite production, far surpassing the prizes in Shanghai.
The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei donated 21 banners, setting a record for the quantity of prizes.
The "Strengthen the Race and Strengthen the Country" red brocade banner presented by Qinghai Association Chairman Ma Bufang was enough to make a large bed sheet, setting a weight record for the prizes.
### Weightlifting Continues in the Light Heavyweight and Heavyweight Categories, Three Athletes Break the Games Record
[Our Dispatch] The light heavyweight weightlifting competition continued yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Guoshu Stadium with the third event, the clean and jerk, which had not been completed the previous day.

As a result, Malayan athlete Long Yading once again won the championship with overwhelming superiority. The results of each athlete are recorded below: The top two both broke the performance record of 508 pounds set by Malayan athlete Huang Sheji at the previous All-China Games. The results of the heavyweight competition are as follows:
The first place broke the performance record of 524.5 pounds set by Malayan athlete Huang Sheji at the previous All-China Games.
### Women's Short Track Winner, Wang Shugui, Speaks in a Spoiled Tone and Still Seems Like a Child, Li Xinyi Was Dragged onto the Stage to Accept the Award
By Our Reporter Hong Xucai
[Our Special Feature] Dusky skin, shiny straight hair, lively eyes, and those slender but strong legs. That is Wang Shugui, the champion of the women's 100-meter final. She is from Shandong and is a high school student at Qingdao Municipal Women's High School. This time, she represents Qingdao to attend the All-China Games. She is 17 years old this year, and her words and actions still seem like a child. She has a fierce expression when running, but in peacetime, she is a most shy girl. And she is good at being spoiled, even her voice is spoiled, but it is purely a natural expression of a girl, so it is especially loved. After winning the championship, the person in charge of the conference, as usual, asked her to say a few words in front of the broadcasting machine, which was broadcasted to all parts of the country. But Miss Wang refused to say anything. She lowered her head, covered her face with her hands, and cried out, "I don't want to talk." But the person in charge of the conference held the broadcasting microphone against her, the Qingdao male players on both sides encouraged her, and the reporters surrounding her even came up with words for her, but she just kept her lips closed and refused to say anything. Looking at her blushing appearance, she just hated that there was no cave to run into. This stalemate lasted for several minutes, and she was overwhelmed and had nowhere to go. Then she burst out a sentence in a low voice that was like a mosquito call: "I am very ashamed that I have not created good results!" The person in charge wanted to ask her to say a few more words, but she was almost about to cry.
Wang Xiaoru's score was 13.4 seconds, which has broken the record of the previous conference and is only 0.2 seconds away from the national record of 13.2 seconds. According to reports, this is exactly her personal best record. Last year, she won the championship with this result in the Qingdao Municipal Games, and this time she got her wish again. It goes without saying that she was happy, and when Miss Wang stood in front of the West Commander's Stand to accept the award, everyone could not help but be happy for her!
The things in the world are never as satisfactory as one would like. Just when Wang Shugui was smug, who would have thought that her colleague was crying in her arms? That is Li Xinyi, the runner-up in the sprint.
Li Xinyi is the niece of Li Sen, the former sprint champion. She is only 14 years old this year, short and fat, and very strong. She is a junior high school student at Nanjing Xinghua Middle School. According to her own statement: in April last year, she broke the national record with a score of 13.1 seconds. This time, she represented Chongqing to participate in the All-China Games, and all parties had high expectations for her. Her father is very supportive of sports in Qingdao, and her elder brother and sister-in-law both graduated from the Sports Department of Central University. All eight members of her family love sports, so it goes without saying that she can only succeed but not fail this time. Moreover, everyone believes that she will succeed this time because of her glorious achievements in the past. Who knows that she has unfortunately failed, so she cried loudly. When the referee asked her to receive the award, she was still crying and unwilling. Later, everyone managed to drag her up with persuasion and force, but her tearful face and frowning expression were really sympathetic!
Afterwards, the reporter pulled her and asked her a few questions. She knew that in addition to the 100-meter sprint, she also participated in the 160-meter and 200-meter sprints, so the hope of victory is still very strong. But she innocently said: "I'm really scared!" The reporter asked her why she failed this time. She said with a sad face: "When starting, someone stole a step and was pulled back three times. At that time, I was panicked and scared, and my heart was beating very hard. I knew that the start was a little slow, so..." Speaking of this, she was about to cry again. The reporter quickly comforted her and said, "You are still young, there are many opportunities. Have a good night's sleep tonight and try again tomorrow!" Only then did she lower her head and return to the dormitory, with a tear in her eyes!

Guangzhou and Air Force are Equally Matched
The Guangzhou team and the Air Force were evenly matched. However, the former's offense was better than its defense, while the latter's offensive and defensive techniques were evenly developed, but there were no outstanding offensives. The Guangzhou team's second row left and right wings were good at smashing, specializing in attacking the opponent's third row, making the Air Force feel threatened. After five fierce sets, the Guangzhou team defeated the Air Force with a score of 3-2. The scores of each set are as follows:
Guangzhou
17-21
21-12
13-21

The Battle Between Beijing and Shanghai Was Tense
The battle between Beijing and Shanghai was the most intense scene in all the volleyball matches yesterday. The two teams had their own strengths and did not give way to each other, launching competitions in a side-by-side situation many times. However, Shanghai won because the strength of each player was more balanced and they were good at contact. The result was also 3-2. The scores of each set are as follows:
Shanghai
21-14

One-Sided Hong Kong Takes the Lead
The match between Hong Kong and Joint Logistics was one-sided. The Hong Kong team put Yu Qien on the second row left, which greatly increased their strength.

Hong Kong
21-14
21-13

Lei Ying Zhang Zhong Wei Zhiquan
Three Straight Sets Fujian Submits a Blank Paper
Fujian's defeat in the match between the Police and Fujian was a pity. Regardless of the strength of the Police team, Fujian team's repeated loss of points was mostly due to not doing their best and losing points that they should not have lost. For example, when two players looked at the ball landing on the ground one after another, it happened four or five times in each set. Also, when the opponent smashed the ball and the front row net of the Min team still crossed into the second row, they let it fall to the ground and no one paid attention to it. This situation happened again and again, until it could not be remedied. The scores of each set and the lineup of the teams are as follows:
Police
21-13
21-11
21-19

Shanghai All Circles Host Athletes Holding a Picnic Regularly

However, the athletes' dinner time must be brought forward as much as possible so that recreation can be held.

### Watching Table Tennis in the Gymnasium, 16 Matches, Ma Yuanhua Abandons the Game
[Our Special Feature] Table tennis is considered a niche program in the All-China Games, and it is ignored by most audiences. However, yesterday there were a lot of people visiting the table tennis competition in the gymnasium. The first reason is naturally that there are many people who love table tennis. The main reason is that the outdoor ball court is humid, and various ball games cannot be held, so many audiences switched locations and all went to the gymnasium.
There were eight matches in the morning and afternoon. The results are listed as follows: (1) Chuan Qifang (Zhejiang) won against Feng Naicheng (Siam) 3-1, (2) Xue Xuchu (Shanghai) won against Mei Zhixiu (Hubei) 3-0, (3) Yu Cheng (Beijing) won against Liu Tonghua (Indonesia) 3-2, (4) Zhou Zhenqiu (Hong Kong) won against Chen Duxing (Police) 3-2, (5) Li Zongpei (Shanghai) won against Gao Yaodong (Qingdao) 3-1, (6) Huang Qipeng (Beijing) won against Hu Ganzhang (Hubei) 3-1, (7) Zhong Zhancheng (Hong Kong) won against Zhang Nianchun (Guizhou) 3-0, (8) Yao Yingyu (Zhejiang) won against Chi Duqing (Indonesia) 3-2. (The above are the results of the morning). (9) You Ruheng (Malaysia) won against Qian Zhenzhi (Beijing) 3-0 (10) Rong Fupei (Air Force) won against He Jingwu (Henan) 3-0, (11) Huang Jingxi (Taiwan) won against Feng Guohao (Guangzhou) 1-1, (12) Liu Guangwen (Xingan) won against Ma Yuanhua (Toronto) (Ma abandoned the game), (13) Liang Zhuohui (Guangzhou) won against Liu Shuyou (Liaoning) 3-0, (14) Gong Zhongzhuan (Guangdong) won against Luo Shixin (Siam) 3-0, (15) Wang Youxin (Taiwan) won against Liu Qingzhen (Police) 3-0, (16) Li Yinghan (Malaysia) won against Yang Gufan (Air Force) 3-0.

### Beside the Table Tennis Table Yu Cheng Has Good Sportsmanship Liu Guangwen Shows Masterpieces
Yu Cheng (Beijing) has very good sportsmanship. In the last game against Liu Tonghua (Indonesia), he lost one move after he had a 9 to 6 advantage. The referee judged it as 10 to 6, but he quickly corrected it to 9 to 7.
Ma Yuanhua is a strange person. He alone represents the Toronto Overseas Chinese team in the All-China Games and participates in two events, tennis and table tennis, but he has never shown his face and is very mysterious.
Liu Guangwen is over forty years old and also represents the Xing'an Province alone. According to him, he has been playing table tennis for fifteen years, and he used to play soft ball. He is not used to playing hard ball. In the Jilin Men's Table Tennis Competition with more than 120 people participating during the enemy's puppet period, he won the third place. Recently, he won the fourth place in the Shenyang All-China Games preliminary competition. He is proficient in Sun Tzu's Art of War and showed reporters one of his masterpieces - an ancient poem:
"Seize the opportunity to make a sad face, be as steady as a mountain and agile as a dragon, be selfless and empty, and hide your sharp edge when attacking the void and approaching the bottom." (Chang

### Inaugural Meeting of the Legislative Yuan Opens; First Preparatory Meeting to Be Held Tomorrow Morning

[Our Nanjing Office, 8th] The first Legislative Yuan under the Constitution convened its own meeting at the National Assembly Hall on the morning of the 8th, declaring its establishment, and collectively visited the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum after the opening ceremony, offering flowers and paying respects. After 9:30 in the morning, the front of the National Assembly Hall, which had been quiet for a week, became lively again. Cars came and went, and pedestrians were in a constant stream. Approximately six to seven hundred people, including male and female legislators wearing various colored admission ribbons, Chinese and foreign guests, reporters, and staff of the Legislative Yuan, entered the hall through the main entrance, above which hung a horizontal banner with the gold characters "Legislative Yuan Meeting Venue" on a vermilion background. At 10:05 AM, Lou Tongsun, Secretary-General of the meeting preparatory office, announced loudly, "Please be seated, members present." Subsequently, Wu Tiecheng, Chairman of the Preparatory Office, reported on two matters: (1) According to the election law, the total number of legislators should be 773. 629 had been officially announced as elected. As of the morning of the 8th, approximately 400 had registered their attendance. According to the Legislative Yuan Organization Law, this was sufficient for a quorum. In accordance with Article 68 of the Constitution and Article 6 of the Procedures for Preparing for the Implementation of the Constitution, the meeting should convene itself on the 8th. The interim chairman was to be the oldest member present, in accordance with precedent, namely Huang Su-fang, a legislator from Sichuan Province, aged 71. However, some legislators pointed out that Kong Geng, a legislator from Hubei Province, aged 76, had also arrived. Consequently, Kong was appointed as the interim chairman. (2) The Preparatory Office invited the Chairman of the National Government to deliver a speech. However, Mr. Chiang had been elected as President but had not yet taken office, and thus was not invited to attend. At 10:15 AM, the opening ceremony began. Interim Chairman Kong Geng took his seat, and after the naval band played ceremonial music, leading the attendees in the proper ceremonies, he delivered a brief speech, stating that he felt deeply honored to be elected as the interim chairman on the first day of the Legislative Yuan under the Constitution, but also felt ashamed due to his advanced age. He said that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings had made it clear that the day the Constitution was implemented was the beginning of returning power to the people. However, today there are many difficulties, and the great revolutionary cause still needs to be completed. The Legislative Yuan under the Constitution is the highest decision-making body for national politics. The mission of the first legislators is extremely important. They must work for the country and the people with a democratic demeanor and revolutionary spirit, hoping for success and willing to encourage each other. At 10:25 AM, the music ended and the ceremony was completed. All the attending legislators then went to visit the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Because Kong Geng was old and lacked physical strength, Huang Su-fang presided over the sacrificial ceremony on his behalf at 11:07 AM. A large wreath of fresh flowers was placed in front of the marble statue of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the mausoleum hall, inscribed with the words "Respectful Offering from All Members of the First Legislative Yuan." The attending legislators stood in a row, led by Huang to perform the ceremony of offering flowers, and observed three minutes of silence. Then, they entered the mausoleum bed in single file to pay their respects. The ceremony concluded at 11:20 AM. The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold its first preparatory meeting at the National Assembly Hall on the morning of the 10th, to discuss various procedural issues and prepare for related matters.

### Chairman Chiang Summons Leaders of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties Separately; Proposes Two Compromise Solutions Regarding the Election of Legislators

[Our Nanjing Office, 8th] On the morning of the self-convened meeting of the Legislative Yuan under the Constitution, Chairman Chiang, in order to resolve the issue of the election of legislators, summoned leaders of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties separately at 9:00 AM and 9:30 AM to explain the situation and propose two compromise solutions. Leaders of both parties agreed to convey these proposals to the responsible figures of their respective parties for further discussion. It is understood that the individuals from the Youth Party summoned by Chairman Chiang at 9:00 AM at his official residence were Yu Jia-ju, Yang Yong-jun, Zheng Zhen-wen, and Liu Dong-yan. Those from the Democratic Socialist Party summoned at 9:30 AM were Xu Fu-lin, Jiang Yun-tian, and Ji Yi-qiao. Chairman Chiang first expressed his apology for the fact that the election results did not meet expectations. He then proposed adopting a compromise solution, hoping that both parties would continue to participate and cooperate. Regarding the number of legislators, if the original target could not be reached, then they would aim for the next best thing, which was that at least half of the originally planned number would still be elected. Those who were not elected would be given positions in the government's administrative departments, but this matter would have to be completed within three months. The two parties subsequently gathered at Xu Fu-lin's residence, but did not make a final decision, pending discussions and responses after holding separate central standing committee meetings. Some members of the Kuomintang believe that there is room for a turnaround.

[Our Nanjing Office, 8th] Regarding the issue of the number of legislators from the two parties, the Kuomintang has appointed seven representatives who will continue to meet with representatives from the two parties in the coming days. The names of these seven are as follows: Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Bu-lei, Chen Li-fu, Wang Shi-jie, Zhang Li-sheng, and Lei Zhen.

### The Modus Operandi of the Three-Party Cooperation Should Be Re-examined

[Our Nanjing Office, 8th] A certain legal expert stated: The three-party coalition government, which was reorganized and established last April, ended when the constitutional government was established. In the future, under the Constitution, the mode of cooperation between the three parties will be completely different from the past. I believe that the three parties should re-examine the mode of cooperation in the future. The number of legislators from the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party is not important. As for whether the new Premier invites the two parties to join the cabinet, he should solicit the opinions of the two parties on the policies he proposes to the Legislative Yuan. This is because the past was a coalition government, while the future will be a responsible cabinet system, which is completely different.
