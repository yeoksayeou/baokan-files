Truman's message focused on domestic policy and the European recovery plan, and did not mention any other foreign countries by name except for China. When promising to include China in the broad plan for the United States to assist in world recovery to achieve peace, Truman explicitly stated that he would soon submit a special plan for China to Congress.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The departure of Yu Ta-wei and Bei Zuyi, high-ranking officials to the United States, has been decided to be postponed. Bei was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 7th, but this has been suspended due to unforeseen circumstances. It is rumored that the delay may be due to insufficient preparation of materials.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Shi Zhaoying, acting director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated in response to reporters' inquiries on the 7th that the visit to the United States by Minister of Communications Yu Ta-wei and former Governor of the Central Bank Bei Zuyi was originally suggested by the Chinese government and agreed upon by the U.S. State Department. The date of their trip to the United States has not yet been decided.

[United Press, Washington, 6th] Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the China Democratic Socialist Party, told United Press reporters here today that the Chinese government will submit a concrete plan for further U.S. aid to China to the United States within a week. The content will inform the United States of China's current situation and self-help capabilities, and make recommendations on where the United States can continue to assist China's needs. Minister of Communications Yu Ta-wei will likely lead the Chinese delegation to negotiate. Yu cooperated with U.S. Secretary of State Marshall when Marshall was in China. The departure date of the delegation is unknown. The recovery plan that China intends to submit to the United States is the result of a review by a five-member committee appointed by President Chiang Kai-shek some time ago. Zhang did not want to speculate on what kind of statement the Chinese representatives would make to the U.S. government, only stating that financial reform and currency stabilization are fundamental problems for China, and estimated that 400 million U.S. dollars would be enough to stabilize China's currency system. Zhang spoke of Marshall's aid to Europe plan, saying that approximately 1.5 billion or 2 billion U.S. dollars could meet all of China's needs. Zhang is now heading to Seattle to lecture on the new Chinese constitution at the University of Washington for two months.

### U.S. Government's Foreign Aid Should Include Far Eastern Countries; Some Congressmen Consider a Broad Plan

[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th (United Press)] On the first day of the current session of Congress, there were strong signs that some congressmen were considering expanding the Marshall European Recovery Plan into a broader plan that would include the Far East. This is because the current government's plan is not consistent, as government officials have stated that in the short term, they are willing to focus their efforts on Europe, except for a specific aid to China plan. Republican Congressman Herter of Massachusetts, who has considerable influence in Congress, frankly stated that he will oppose the Marshall Plan proposed by the government, because the plan, when the time is ripe, still cannot include Japan, China, and other regions of the Far East in the government's foreign aid. Herter did not make a definite prediction, but said that he believes that under a general plan, aid to Japan can be implemented immediately after the signing of the peace treaty and the end of the military occupation, and aid to China will also be implemented under a general plan, rather than a separate plan. Herter led a special congressional committee to Europe last June to investigate relief needs and recently submitted a bill advocating that global aid should be implemented under a bipartisan institution, rather than the Marshall Plan, which is said to be promoted by the Secretary of State. Herter argued that the Secretary of State can only direct the diplomatic policy part of the relief plan, but has no actual implementation authority. Regarding the control of allocation, he advocated concentrating it under a new institution, rather than being managed by the Departments of Agriculture and Commerce. He pointed out the score and distribution of the global relief plan, saying: "Last year, our exports to the 16 countries participating in the Paris Conference accounted for only one-third of the total exports, and the rest were exported to the Far East, South America, and other regions. Few people understand this point."

### Zhou Yide Broadcasts: Seeking Aid to China to Fight for Freedom

[United Press, New York, 7th] Republican Congressman Zhou Yide delivered a broadcast speech on the air tonight, saying that the best opportunity for the United States to prevent a third world war is to do everything possible to ensure that the Soviet Union cannot control China. If the United States fails to aid China now, then the manpower and money it sacrificed in the Pacific War will be wasted. Rather than allowing the Soviet Union to control China, it would be better to allow Japan to take over China in the past. China needs economic reform, but President Chiang Kai-shek is well aware of this. If the United States hopes for the Chinese government to improve, it should support the government's efforts to fight for freedom. Zhou also said that the less the United States aids China, the more miserable China will be. The more miserable China is, the less aid it will receive. This vicious cycle must be broken. At the same time, former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Litvinoff also participated in the radio program and expressed support for Zhou's proposal. However, Far East experts, such as Dr. Lattimore, president of the International College of Hopkins University, and Lauterbach, former Life magazine reporter in China, had different views. According to Lattimore, Americans are less popular in China than Soviet personnel. Currently, the Chinese people are very patriotic and oppose the interference of the country in Chinese internal affairs the most. Unfortunately, there are thousands of American military advisors stationed in China, and all the aircraft used to bomb Chinese villages are made in the United States. It is increasingly clear that the CCP has not accepted Soviet arms supplies. Qualified American journalists who have been paying attention to the evidence of Soviet aid to the CCP for years have found nothing.

### No Reaction from American Businesses to Our Increased Import Tax; Some Exporters Express Sympathy

[Central News Agency, New York, 6th] American exporters who engage in trade with China have not yet reacted to China's increase in import tax by 50%. They either do not know about the new measures or are waiting for detailed reports. According to a spokesperson for the New York Export Managers Club, only a few American exporters ship goods to China for trade, so "most exporters have not considered this issue." He said: "Any tax increase measure will naturally restrict exports to China." According to a spokesperson for the National Foreign Trade Council, in the short term, a 50% additional tax will have little impact on American exports to China, because China's demand for American goods is currently urgent and will not be hindered by high tax rates. However, in the long term, it is naturally unfavorable, because this method restricts American exports to China. A major exporter expressed sympathy for the Chinese government's increase in tariffs in order to obtain urgently needed national income, but declined to judge how the tariff increase would affect his business.

### Japanese Weapons Fall into CCP Hands; U.S. Demands Explanation from Soviet Union; Heated Debate in Allied Control Council

[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] There was no "formal" item on the agenda before the meeting of the Allied Council for Japan on the morning of the 7th, but in the course of the meeting, a heated debate suddenly broke out between the U.S. and Soviet representatives. The chairman, U.S. representative Sebald, told Soviet Deputy Representative Major General Kislenko that recent reports stated that all the weapons of the Japanese Kwantung Army had been received by the Soviet Union in 1945, but had fallen into the hands of the CCP army. Therefore, the United States wanted the Soviet Union to provide information on this matter. Kislenko refused to release any information, citing that the committee had no right to make this inquiry.

At the beginning of the meeting, the Soviet representative took the lead in raising the issue of Japanese armaments. He accused Sebald of attempting to weaken the committee.

In addition, people at the embassy declined to express any opinions, but according to what reporters know, the British side views the Kowloon incident as a local incident, which occurred when the Hong Kong government exercised its right to use the land for local health and construction purposes. Our government believes that no matter how the sovereignty or right to use the area is ultimately resolved, the Hong Kong side's compulsory measures are unfriendly. The purpose of our protest is first to make the Hong Kong side pay attention to the traditional friendship between China and Britain, and then to seek a fundamental solution to the dispute through diplomatic channels. The consequences of the Kowloon incident are not just local events, but have indeed involved the friendship between China and Britain. Future developments will depend on how the Hong Kong side considers this matter rationally.

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 7th] The Hong Kong government's forced demolition of houses in Kowloon City has aroused unusual indignation from all walks of life here.

[Our Newspaper News] London 7th Broadcast: Yangon News, Chinese Ye Wai-tz claimed that China has the most friendly good neighborly spirit to independent Burma.

Among those who attacked this grand ceremony were the Chinese special representative, Madame Aung San, and a few friends of U Myint Thein. Before presenting the flag, U Tin Tut made the following brief remarks: "Envoy, I would like to present this Burmese national flag, which was made according to standard dimensions and flew on the flagpole on Independence Memorial Day, to you as a symbol of the diplomatic relations between China and Burma. I would like to express my gratitude to your country for sending such an outstanding person as you to the Kingdom to participate in the Independence Memorial Ceremony."

I would like to assure you that when this flag flies in China, it will receive the highest respect of the Chinese people." The Burmese national flag is quite similar to our national flag in terms of color and design, but in addition to the blue sky, white sun, and red earth, five stars have been added. These five stars represent the five ethnic groups that make up the Burmese Federation: the Burmese, Kachin, Karen, Shan, and Chin. This historical Burmese national flag will be brought back to China by our country's special envoy group on the day of leaving Burma on the 8th.

### A Fair Discussion of the Kowloon Walled City Incident

The Hong Kong government's forced eviction of 2,000 residents from the Kowloon Walled City has suddenly escalated in recent days. The incident began when the Hong Kong government's Public Works Department issued a notice on November 27th of last year, ordering the "compulsory relocation" of 2,000 residents of the Kowloon Walled City, with a deadline of December 11th. The residents of Kowloon Walled City, believing that the area belonged to China and that administrative power still rested with the Chinese government, organized a residents' association to petition the local government and the diplomatic commissioner, and publicly declared that they would not hesitate to risk bloodshed. Guo Dehua, the diplomatic commissioner stationed in Guangdong and Guangxi, in addition to drawing the Hong Kong government's attention to the matter, once went to Nanjing to seek instructions, hoping to resolve the case through diplomatic means. December 11th passed without incident in Kowloon Walled City, but the magistrate of the Kowloon New Territories issued summonses to the representatives of the Kowloon Walled City Residents' Association. The representatives remained steadfast in the face of adversity and refused to accept the Hong Kong authorities' illegal summonses, resulting in the arrest of two representatives. On the 5th of this month, the Hong Kong government further escalated the situation, mobilizing 250 police special forces to enter the Kowloon Walled City to carry out demolition work, leaving a large number of residents homeless in the ruins. Judging from the Hong Kong police's capabilities, the first step of their action is to demolish the civil houses in Kowloon Walled City, the second step is to drive the homeless Chinese out of the country, and the last step is to establish police power and complete its occupation. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has protested to the Hong Kong government against this forced action. We are deeply concerned about this incident and hope that the government will reason with the British government and effectively prevent the Hong Kong police from infringing on China's sovereignty through unreasonable actions.

The Kowloon Walled City is located in the northeast corner of the Kowloon Peninsula. In the late Qing Dynasty, it was called "Kowloon Fortress" and had city walls to defend the sea. In the 22nd year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty (1842 AD), during the Opium War, the Treaty of Nanjing was forcibly signed, ceding Hong Kong to Britain. In 1860, Britain continued to lease Kowloon (known as the New Territories of Kowloon) as a shield for Hong Kong. However, the old site of the Kowloon Walled City and Longjin Avenue still belonged to Chinese territory and were under the jurisdiction of the An'an County of Guangdong Province. On June 9, 1898, China and Britain signed the "Convention between Great Britain and China Respecting an Extension of Hong Kong Territory," which stipulated the boundary between Hong Kong and Kowloon Walled City, stating: "The Chinese officials now stationed in the city of Kowloon shall continue to exercise jurisdiction there, but shall not interfere in any way with the maintenance of law and order in the leased territory. Chinese merchant vessels may use Kowloon Bay as a harbor, and continue to enjoy the use of the jetties and landing-places near Kowloon City." It was also agreed that "within the area to be expanded, residents must not be forced to relocate, and property must not be confiscated." It is very clear that the Kowloon Walled City is territory belonging to Chinese sovereignty. Chinese officials can not only exercise their functions within the boundary but also Chinese people have the freedom to reside in the area and are not allowed to be interfered with in any way. The weak Qing government ceded Hong Kong and the Kowloon Peninsula, leaving only the smallest area of Kowloon Walled City, allowing Guangdong Province, the richest in the country, to hold on to it until today. Our people have always expected a reasonable solution to the Hong Kong issue, especially after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. Unexpectedly, the Hong Kong issue after the war remains unresolved, and the Hong Kong government has instead intensified its efforts, violating previous agreements, forcing the residents of Kowloon Walled City to relocate, intending to forcibly occupy Chinese territory and expand the scope of British-controlled Hong Kong. In order to safeguard national territorial sovereignty and protect the lives and property of 2,000 residents, in addition to sympathizing with the Kowloon Walled City residents' reasoned resistance, we also hope that the diplomatic authorities will take vigorous negotiations after the customary protest.

British colonial policy in the 18th century originally had the intention of expanding the scope of Hong Kong and developing economic power in the Far East. In August 1842, Hong Kong was seized; in October 1860, the Kowloon Peninsula was seized; in June 1898, the boundary was surveyed, expanding the scope of Hong Kong. However, the Hong Kong government did not give up on seizing Kowloon Walled City. In 1933, 1936, 1939, and September 1947, there were four forced relocations of Kowloon Walled City residents. This is now the fifth action. The dispute in 1936 was quite serious, and the houses in Kowloon Walled City were almost completely demolished. At that time, due to the residents' firm resistance, the national public opinion rallied in support, and the five-province diplomatic officials reasoned and fought without yielding, thus preserving this piece of land for China. In particular, Mr. Jie Hou's adaptable attitude and courageous spirit, never retreating an inch of territory, forced the Hong Kong government to retreat under justice, and there was still the legacy of revolutionary diplomacy in 1927. Therefore, in order to protect this small piece of land, we have had a glorious history, and we have shown firm struggle in diplomacy and administration. This dispute is more serious than the previous incidents. We want to see whether the diplomatic authorities, for the sake of past glory, will continue to adopt a positive, rational attitude and steps to preserve the sovereignty of Kowloon Walled City.

Therefore, we call on the government authorities, after the protest from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to make a prompt decision and coordinate effective administrative actions to prevent the Hong Kong police from invading Kowloon Walled City, and to demand that the Hong Kong authorities release the arrested residents' representatives and compensate the residents of Kowloon Walled City for the losses they have suffered in life and property. If we fail to seize the opportunity in diplomacy and administration and take appropriate measures, resulting in the loss of sovereignty over Kowloon Walled City, this will affect the country's credibility

Finally, we hope that the British government and the Hong Kong authorities will recognize the long-term relationship between China and Britain and refrain from actions that stimulate the feelings of the Chinese people. The Kowloon Walled City issue does not involve a dispute over treaty interpretation. We are delighted to see Britain's withdrawal from India and the independence of Burma, and we hope that the British authorities will also adopt an enlightened attitude and handle the Kowloon issue properly. Strictly speaking, Kowloon Walled City itself is a place that the Hong Kong government's power cannot reach. Even for security reasons, it should first stabilize the people's hearts, and absolutely not allow the demolition of houses and forced relocation to occur. We value the good relations between China and Britain and hope that the Hong Kong authorities can quickly regain their senses and stop this kind of action!

### Japanese Armaments Issue

[Continued from Page 1] Gilmin stated: The US representative attempted to conceal the truth and obstruct discussions by the committee. Regarding discussions and control of Japan, Sebald denied concealing the truth and stated: The information now requested by the Soviet Union had already been obtained. The Soviet representative stated: He requested information relating to the disarmament of Japan, including airfields, arsenals, coastal defenses, and other relevant materials, up to the end of 1947. He stated: When he proposed including this item on the agenda for the 7th, Mr. Sebald invited him for a conversation and told him that the item was not intended to be included on the agenda. Mr. Gil stated: The US representative's reasons were insufficient, and he wished to protest this "dictatorial" behavior and denied that Mr. Sebald had stated that the Soviet Union's request had ever been referenced in the charter. Sebald revealed that the Soviet Union's request included ten independent issues regarding the disarmament of Japan, but he did not elaborate. Mr. Sebald reiterated that the Soviet representatives in Japan and in the Far Eastern Commission in Washington DC were aware of all the information they were now requesting.

After the Soviet Union raised the issue of Japanese heavy armaments, Sebald told Mr. Gil: The Soviet Union received a request on September 18, 1946, instructing it to provide information on Japanese armaments in the Northeast. The Soviet Union replied at the time that it could not report until all the information had been compiled. Although the Soviet Union had published a report shortly after Japan's surrender in 1945, Sebald stated that this report was superficial in nature and intended solely for press use. Mr. Sebald also stated: Recent newspapers have pointed out that the armaments of the Japanese Kwantung Army have fallen into the hands of the Chinese Communists. The United States hopes to learn the truth about this situation. He stated: A detailed report from the Japanese Armaments Office would help the Military Commission to draft a final report on the disposition of the Japanese military organization. Gromyko declared: The news regarding the Northeast is completely irrelevant to the situation in Japan. Mr. Sebald retorted: "Then does your representative deny that the Kwantung Army was part of the Japanese army?" The Soviet representative accused Mr. Sebald of requesting information outside the committee's jurisdiction. He stated that Mr. Sebald's remarks regarding the Chinese Communists were intended to divert attention and conceal his own "fault" in not including the item proposed by the Soviet Union on the agenda. He stated: If the United States were not concealing the truth, the requested information should have been published long ago. There is no excuse for not discussing this issue. Mr. Gil openly insisted on including his request on the agenda for the next meeting, but Mr. Sebald also firmly refused to yield. He stated that a similar report had been provided to the Soviet Union a year ago. In addition, the information obtained by the Far Eastern Commission was extremely detailed. Mr. Sebald then accused the Soviet Union of abusing the committee. He stated: It is time to stop this abuse. "I have tried to make this committee a constructive institution, but it has apparently failed."

The Soviet representative then turned to inquire about the opinions of the Chinese and British representatives. General Shang Zhen, the Chinese representative, stated that he had no criticism at present and that it was up to the chairman, Mr. Sebald, to decide whether the Soviet Union's item should be included on the agenda. Mr. Shaw, the British representative, stated that he was always able to obtain the information he needed, seemingly supporting the US position, but he also stated: There should be no restrictions on the inclusion of "appropriate issues" on the agenda of the province.

### Wuxi Grain Market Suspended; Black Market Enters Chaotic State; Zhenjiang Organizes Economic Inspection Team

[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 7th] Today's rice prices are severely restricted by the provincial authorities, with white japonica rice not allowed to exceed one million per shi. However, investigations reveal that various banks and warehouses are piled high with goods. Due to hoarding, the market has been suspended, and the black market outside the market has entered a chaotic state. Prices of various goods have soared accordingly. White rice is sold for one million, and the black market has reached a new high of 1.27 million.

Underground money houses charge a daily interest rate of 1.2%, but speculators still flock to them like startled birds. Prices continue to rise, and cooked rice is almost non-existent in the market. Coarse rice sells for 1.08 million per shi, soybean oil sells for 32,000 per catty, and pork sells for 30,000 per catty, with prices still expected to rise. Kerosene is in great demand because electric lights have not yet been restored, and it sells for 20,000 per catty today. Elementary school teachers, due to their low salaries and the fact that they are often owed several months' pay, have difficulty getting enough to eat all day and rely on selling newspapers to make a living, a very miserable situation.

### Grain Merchant Zhen Pingzhai Manifests Great Righteousness, Suppresses Price Increases, Voluntarily Reduces Prices, and Sells Off Large Quantities

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 7th] As grain prices are being raised competitively and stockpiled, a righteous merchant, Zhen Pingzhai, has suddenly appeared in Beiping, voluntarily reducing prices for sale, which has greatly impacted the market. Zhen is the manager of Dasheng Rice Shop, who has always abided by regulations and has printed and distributed regulations for controlled commodity prices to his colleagues. Recently, grain prices have fluctuated sharply. On the 3rd, the market price of rice rose to 24,000 per catty, but he raised his arms and shouted, selling 600,000 catties at 19,000. After selling tens of thousands of catties, grain prices immediately fell as a result. Since then, he has been coming to the market every day to sell at reduced prices. Upon hearing the news, the Beiping Social Affairs Bureau decided to submit a commendation to the municipal government.

### Victory Over Bandits Arrives with the New Year: Deng Wenyi Reports on a Week of Battles

[Our Nanjing dispatch from the seventh] Deng Wenyi, Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, reported at a press conference on the afternoon of the seventh on the week of battles from December 31, 1947, to January 6, 1948, stating: The military suppression of bandits has achieved new victories with the arrival of the New Year of 1948. Frequent reports of victories from various fronts symbolize the beginning of this triumph. A breakdown of the battle situation on each front within the week is as follows:

Northeast Theater: Bandit forces briefly approached the outskirts of Pan last week, but were annihilated by a Nationalist counterattack. In the four days from December 29 to January 2, Nationalist forces inflicted fatal blows on the attacking bandit forces of the First, Third, Sixth, and Tenth Columns in areas such as Wanjintai and Pangutai in northern Liaoning. The bandits suffered heavy losses and fled in disarray towards the southeast and northwest of Faku. On the Liaoxi front, the Eighth and Ninth Columns of bandits attacking Xinlitun were counter-encircled by Nationalist forces, suffering over ten thousand casualties. On January 3, a portion retreated towards Beizhen and Heishan, where Nationalist forces are currently attacking them. The Fourth Column of bandits in southern Liaoning is being encircled and attacked by Nationalist forces. Simultaneously, our air force achieved brilliant results in the Northeast on January 5, killing over five hundred bandits near Changchun and destroying many bandit transport units and heavily loaded vehicles southwest of Faku, inflicting heavy losses on the bandits.

Hebei-Chahar Front: The Ronghe bandit forces attempted to disrupt the Pingbao and Pingsui railways and threaten Bao Yuan. Over the past week, Nationalist forces launched a multi-pronged campaign, initially annihilating over ten thousand bandits near Yanqing, southern Chahar, on January 3. The Independent Brigade harassing the Pingsui Railway has been reduced to only one thousand men and is fleeing north, resulting in the first major victory of the New Year. Subsequently, on January 4, another brigade of the Fourth Column was annihilated near Pinggang, Dingxian. The Third Column is also currently surrounded by our forces. Nationalist forces on the North China front have achieved outstanding results.

Dabie Mountain Area: The Liu bandits, in an attempt to evade Nationalist encirclement, have broken into smaller groups and scattered into the mountains. Their First Column is wandering in the areas north and south of Runan. The Liu bandits' Second and Third Columns have broken into several small groups and scattered in the areas south of Shucheng and Tongcheng, and north of Qianshan and Taihu. The Sixth Column has scattered east of Jingfu and into the Shangba River and Tongzi River areas. The Tenth Column, which fled to Xinye, and the remnants of the Twelfth Column of bandits in Dahong Mountain, are being searched and suppressed by Nationalist forces and local militias. Additionally, the main force of the Liu bandits' Jianghan Independent Brigade, led by Luo Houfu, is still being contained by Nationalist forces at Xingouzuizi, north of Jianli, wandering aimlessly. A group of over three hundred bandits who escaped to Wuxue was defeated by local forces on the fifth, and Wuxue has returned to its original state.

Lu-Yu Border Region: Chen Yi's bandit forces, the Eighth and Eleventh Columns, besieged Heze and suffered heavy losses. A portion has now fled north. The First, Third, Fourth, and Sixth Columns, after participating in the attack on Queshan and Yancheng, suffered significant casualties. Except for the Sixth Column, which is still on the outskirts of Yancheng, the First, Third, and Fourth Columns have all scattered into the area between Shangshui, Xiangcheng, and Runan. Nationalist forces are launching a three-pronged encirclement from the east, west, and north.

Chen Geng's bandit forces, the Fourth and Ninth Columns, after failing to besiege Queshan, were counterattacked by Nationalist forces. On December 31, the siege of Queshan was lifted. The Ninth Column entrenched itself in the Wuyang and Bao'an area, while the Fourth Column scattered near Yancheng. Subsequently, after a multi-pronged attack by Nationalist forces, the two columns retreated to the vicinity of Biyang on January 5. There is currently no major fighting in that area.

Overall, the bandit situation on various fronts this week confirms that the bandit forces have no clear operational objectives and are merely hoping to achieve a lucky victory. Their strategy of breaking into smaller groups and scattering is simply an attempt to prolong their survival by looting and harming the people. This kind of violent banditry, if allowed to continue, will inevitably arouse popular hatred and shorten the distance to their destruction. We can conclude that the development of the communist bandits last year has reached its peak. The fading light is disappearing with the end of the year. The Nationalist forces' suppression of bandits may be more difficult in the future, but continuous victories will come with the New Year.

### Truman Submits Message to Congress Urging Approval of Aid to Europe Plan; Reveals Five Major Policy Directions for the Future

[Report from this newspaper] New York, broadcast on the 7th, Washington report, President Truman today submitted a message to Congress, strongly urging Congress to pass $6.8 billion in aid to Europe, as the initial 15 months of the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe. Mr. Truman also said: The result of economic cooperation between the United States and other countries in the Western Hemisphere can lead to the early realization of the aid to China plan. He pointed out that the "Truman Doctrine" has maintained the integrity of Greece and Turkey, and promised to work hard to sign peace treaties with Germany, Austria, Japan, and South Korea, although these efforts are currently being obstructed by the Soviet Union.

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] President Truman personally read his annual Congressional Inauguration Message to Congress on the 7th, urging Congress to abandon partisan views, quickly approve the European Recovery Plan, and give him effective weapons to stop the domestic runaway price inflation trend as soon as possible. Truman put forward a broad legislative plan to supplement the New Deal policy created by the late President Roosevelt. He said: "We can increase the national annual production by at least one-third compared with the current level. We can raise the living standard to a level that is one billion higher than ten years ago. We can make significant progress in eliminating poverty in this generation." Regarding the aid to Europe plan, he emphasized that congressional approval of the $6.8 billion in aid to Europe for the first fifteen months starting on April 1 is of the utmost importance. He also reiterated the request to control wages and prices and implement quantitative distribution in order to prevent the reduction of living standards and the formation of economic panic. Mr. Truman also put forward five major guidelines to the American people in his message, which can enable the United States to complete a glorious future in the next ten years: * Obtain full and major human rights for American citizens; * Protect and develop America's national resources; * Maintain and use national resources to promote the welfare of the people; * Improve the living standards of all people in the country by strengthening the economic system and enabling the people to share the national production; * Achieve world peace based on the principles of freedom, equality, and justice for all countries.

### Promoting the Marshall Plan Striving for Coordination Among All Nationalities

Regarding the tax plan, he proposed reducing the tax amount for those with low incomes and increasing the profit tax for large enterprises by 3.2 billion yuan. He also put forward a comprehensive social security system, including unemployment relief and health assistance, etc. He also advocated expanding public works projects, such as building water gates, electrical engineering, and land engineering, etc. Regarding foreign policy, he stated that the Marshall Aid to Europe Plan is the main factor of the Heavenly Kingdom's foreign policy. He emphasized that "We are taking perfect and concrete approaches to realize our determination to complete peace. We are fighting hard to overcome famine and suffering in order to achieve peace.

We are seeking to establish a world where all countries, large and small, can survive freely without fear of aggression. We are striving for the coordination of all nationalities in the world, based on individual dignity and human mutual love."

### Stating the Aid to Europe Plan Which Involved the Soviet Union

When referring to the Marshall Plan, Truman indirectly referred to the Soviet Union and its neighbors, but did not directly name them. He said: "Unfortunately, not all governments in the world share the hopes of the American people to achieve economic recovery in many parts of the world through international cooperation, although we should still do our best to overcome economic paralysis." Other points in Truman's message include the issue of racial discrimination in the United States, which he believes is inconsistent with American traditions. He will submit a special project later to deal with this matter. In addition, he also advocated making Hawaii and Alaska two states of the United States. Regarding industry, he said that in the next few years, the industrial sector should invest at least 30 billion yuan to develop production.

### Regarding Labor Proposed Increasing Wages

Regarding labor, he proposed raising the current minimum wage from 45 cents to 75 cents per hour.

### Basic Materials for Aid to Europe Provided to Congress for Reference

[US News Agency, Washington, 7th] A set of material reports was released here today, showing that under the proposed European Recovery Plan, many of the needs of the sixteen countries participating in the recovery are difficult to implement for a while. These reports were prepared for the reference of Congress and provide a detailed analysis of the figures for basic materials and the situation of world supply put forward by the Paris Conference last year. The preface to the report points out that there is a severe shortage of many basic materials, and it is impossible to fully meet the estimated needs of the participating countries in the first few years of the implementation of the recovery plan.

### Total Aid to Europe Canceled Greatly Increased Hope for Passage Vandenberg Says Possibility Increases Fivefold

[United Press, Washington, 6th] Regarding foreign aid, after President Truman decided to withdraw the amount of 17 billion US dollars in the Marshall Plan, the hope that the European Recovery Act can be passed by Congress has greatly increased.

In view of the recent international situation, it is necessary to formulate a new policy. All resolutions in this cabinet meeting will be announced by Bevin in the House of Commons during the debate on foreign affairs after Congress reconvenes on the 21st.

### The Far East Committee Has Decided The Annual Steel Production of Japan is 5.5 Million Tons

[Report from this newspaper] New York, broadcast on the 7th: Washington News, it is reported that the Far East Committee has decided to allow Japan to produce 5.5 million tons of steel annually after the signing of the peace treaty with Japan. This production volume is approximately equal to Japan's production volume between 1933 and 1935. The Economic Committee of the Far East Committee has unanimously agreed that Japan's pig iron production should be set at 2 million tons per year, and cast iron should be set at 3.5 million tons per year.

In 1933-35, Japan produced 2,384,000 tons of pig iron and 3,265,000 tons of cast iron annually, totaling 5,649,000 tons. At the same time, the Far East Committee is also trying to determine Japan's merchant ship tonnage. Well-informed sources said that the Economic Committee's passage of Japan's steel production volume is equivalent to the passage of the Far East Committee's plenary session, because all major countries are represented in the Economic Committee. The Economic Committee has also reached decisions on Japan's aluminum industry and other industries' production, but is unwilling to disclose them, because when passing these decisions, some countries abstained, so the vote in the plenary session may change. Regarding Japan's merchant ship tonnage, it is generally agreed that ships sailing along the Japanese mainland should be about 1 to 1.5 million tons, but opinions on the tonnage of seagoing ships are extremely inconsistent.

### Calling Newspaper Leaders to Discuss Saving Paper

Regarding paper saving, the municipal government recently received instructions from the Executive Yuan. The regulations on saving paper for newspapers, magazines, and books are as follows: Newspapers in various places should strive to save space in the arrangement of news and advertisements. Those that were originally more than one sheet should automatically reduce to one sheet after the promulgation of these measures. Those that were originally more than two sheets should not exceed two sheets, and those that were originally more than three sheets should not exceed two and a half sheets. The page size of magazines in various places should follow the following regulations: 1. Weekly publications should be limited to 16 pages per issue, 2. Biweekly publications should be limited to 32 pages per issue, 3. Monthly publications and above should be limited to 64 pages per issue. The above page counts are all calculated on one side, and the cover can be added with another four pages. Newspapers, magazines, and books should use domestic paper as much as possible. The Ministry of Interior may adjust the quantity of newspapers and magazines in various places according to the needs of the matter, in order to achieve a balanced cultural development in the midst of saving. Newspapers and magazines without sufficient funds and fixed addresses should be strictly restricted from registration.

Regarding this point, the discussion was very thorough at the meeting. Speaker Pan suggested that newspapers should be based on one sheet in principle, and those with more than one sheet should reduce the ratio. Li Zikuan expressed his approval in principle, but all Chinese and foreign newspapers must be restricted equally. As a result, it was decided that the Social Affairs Bureau would call newspaper leaders to discuss and then submit it to the Ministry of Interior.

### Flourishing Domestic Film Industry: Studios Compete for Stars, Talent Sought, Many New Studios Still Planned This Year

[Our Report] The film industry in this city experienced extraordinary growth last year. In addition to the state-run "China Film Studio," the private "China Electric," "Kunlun," "Wen Hua," "Cathay," and "Shanghai Real" all established studios in Shanghai. However, due to the failure to obtain official exchange rates for film imports, with most supplies coming from Kodak on a piecemeal basis, the total output was less than one-fifth of pre-war levels. However, this also led to a more rigorous production attitude, with almost all themes drawn from the people, fully reflecting reality, which was the most valuable achievement of the entire film art last year. Among them, Kunlun's "The Spring River Flows East" was welcomed and sold out in over 800 screenings last year, breaking the pre-war sales records of "Song of the Fishermen" (84 days) and "Sisters' Flowers" (60 days). Secondly, "China Film Studio's" documentary "China's Resistance Against Japan" was also warmly welcomed by the people in various places. Due to the limitations of material resources and the simplicity of all equipment, it is still difficult for production techniques to compete with Western films, so the market in Southeast Asia has not yet been fully expanded. In terms of actors, very few new talents have been promoted, and the "stars" with some reputation have become the object of competition among the studios, with some even offering huge "recruiting fees" to attract them. It is expected that many people will continue to plan new studios starting this year, and the need for talent is becoming increasingly urgent. It is expected that training new actors will be the top priority for the film industry this year.

### A Child's Toy Causes a Great Disaster: Explosion of Raw Materials for "Throwing Firecrackers" Kills Shop Owner, Injures Four

[Our Report] The Jinxing Firecracker Workshop, located at No. 85 Caopeng, Huachang Road, at the end of Tiantong'an Road in Zhabei, had just opened for four days when, unexpectedly, at about 10:10 last night, while manufacturing "throwing firecrackers," the raw materials for the explosives suddenly exploded.

### Shanghai-Xunyang, Shanghai-Hankou Distance-Based Pricing: China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Says It's Difficult

The Ministry of Transportation previously forwarded a suggestion from the Ministry of Finance to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other shipping companies to calculate the freight rates for the Shanghai-Xunyang and Shanghai-Hankou sections based on the distance traveled. According to the person in charge of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, it seems inappropriate to make changes to this matter, and three reasons are stated: 1. Freight transportation is very scarce between Xunyang and Hankou. If the Shanghai-Xunyang and Shanghai-Hankou sections are calculated separately, it will not be possible to compensate for the loss of empty tonnage in shipping. 2. The distance between Jiujiang and Hankou on the Yangtze River route is very short, and both passengers and cargo use Hankou as a distribution center, so Jiujiang is not a major port of call, but a mere bay port. 3. According to shipping practice, the freight rate for the Shanghai-Hankou section is calculated based on the Shanghai-Hankou section, which implies the intention of subsidizing it. The above three points have been formally submitted to the Ministry by the National Shipping Federation and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance.

### Communist Party Distributing Propaganda

The Post Office Has No Right to Inspect [Our Report] Recently, many Communist Party propaganda materials have been found in this city, all delivered by mail in the form of letters. Yesterday, the reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the post office to inquire about whether there were any methods to prevent this. According to him, the post office has no right to open any sealed letters due to postal regulations, otherwise, it would be illegal. The mail inspection system implemented during the war was carried out by military and political organs sending personnel to reside in the bureau for inspection, not by the post office itself. The responsibility of the post office is only to accurately deliver the mail sent by the sender to the recipient, so the post office itself is unable to prevent the Communist Party from using the post office to send out propaganda materials.

Currently, there is only one fertilizer manufacturing plant in Taiwan Province, and the supply of products cannot meet the demand. Soybean cakes from Northeast China were once sold to Taiwan and were very popular, but the supply has been cut off due to military relations. Therefore, if a fertilizer plant could be established in Taiwan at this time, it would have great potential for development.

Therefore, it was specifically resolved to request Minister Yu to purchase materials and order new ships for the shipping industry during his visit to the United States to expand the shipping industry.

### Huainan Mining and Railway Company Files Lawsuit Over Purchase of Railroad Ties

[Our Report] Liu Wenxun, the general manager of the Huainan Mining and Railway Company, recently filed a lawsuit with the local court, accusing Englishman Schneideron and Chinese citizens Qian Yujin and Lu Xiangyi of fraud.

After being appraised by the British Paulison Trading Company, it was confirmed that the wood had rotted and was unusable. The Huainan Mining and Railway Company demanded that the defendants return the deposit and compensation for losses, but to no avail. Therefore, they filed a lawsuit accusing them of fraud and demanding compensation for the plaintiff's losses of US$985,158.50.

After taking photos, the groundbreaking ceremony began in the music. Wu Guozhen, Yan Huiqing, Fang Zhi, Yan Zhuang, and Zhao Zukang each held a hoe and shovel. In an instant, hoes and shovels danced in unison, and the sound of "Hangyu" rose everywhere. The wind was cold and the soil was dry, making it difficult to break the ground. However, Dr. Yan, with his head full of white hair, used all his strength to insert the iron shovel into the mud, and then assisted it with his feet, and the soil began to loosen. At this time, Mayor Wu was also exhausted and out of breath, and he called out "I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore." Then he was the first to let go, and the groundbreaking ceremony was completed in the cheers and applause of the crowd. Five holes were dug in the vast square.

### Rice Industry Again Petitions for Exemption from Business Tax

Although representatives of grain merchants from all over the country have petitioned in Beijing four times for the continued exemption of the grain industry from business tax, since the business tax was transferred to local governments for collection in July of the 35th year of the Republic, local governments are still studying whether to exempt the tax for the sake of prudent handling and have not yet made a decision. The Rice Business Association of this city believes that the food issue is the most serious among the current people's livelihood problems. Once the business tax is levied, it will inevitably affect the rice price and stimulate price increases. Therefore, it convened a meeting of 250 representatives of its 2,400 rice shops more than ten days ago to discuss the issue of petitioning for exemption from business tax and the tax calculation standard for the first category of profit-seeking enterprises. Regarding the exemption from business tax, in addition to resolving to invoke the fourth item of tax-exempt businesses listed in Article 2 of the amended Business Tax Law and requesting the authorities to issue a clear order allowing exemption, the association has also submitted a request to the Municipal Council, requesting the Municipal Government to discuss the case within one week of the municipal administration meeting, striving for a quick passage of the exemption, and requesting the Municipal Government to jointly submit to the central government and telegrams to all provinces and cities to exempt the tax in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.

### Railway Workers Tense, Year-End Bonus Negotiations Continue Today

[Our Report] Pan Bingqing, Wang Cheng, Gao Qifu, and five others from the Two-Way General Labor Union negotiated with Director Chen Bozhuang on the issue of year-end bonuses and the union's request for adjustments to housing subsidies and the issuance of uniforms. The bureau has agreed to give a one-month year-end bonus, while the union is demanding one and a half months. Director Chen said that the bureau's finances are tight and it is difficult to accept the housing subsidy and uniform requests. Railway workers are paying close attention to the negotiations between the representatives and the director. Yesterday afternoon, a large number of workers were waiting for news in the locomotive room and other places, and their emotions were tense. Their only reason is that passenger and freight costs have increased by 70% to 100%, while employee benefits remain the same, which is unreasonable. The issue was not resolved by night and negotiations will continue today.

### Ships Sailing on the Beiyang Line Prepare to Call at Weihaiwei

### Police Bureau Personnel Director Wu Jie Accused of Accepting Bribes

[Our Report] Wu Jie, the director of the Personnel Office of the Police Bureau, was previously accused by a person named Yu that Wu had used his authority to accept bribes and manipulate personnel promotions and demotions. The Supreme Court Procuratorate ordered the Shanghai High Procuratorate to transfer the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Ding Tongjun, the prosecutor in charge of the case, summoned the defendant for questioning on the 5th of this month and summoned Liu Shaokui, the section chief of the First Section of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Police Bureau, senior officials Chen Chunxi, Wang Roubang, Wu Yongfa, and Yang Feizhang to testify. According to Wu, the promotion or demotion of officers in each branch bureau is reported by the branch bureau chiefs, and the Personnel Office submits it to the bureau chief for approval based on this report, so he himself has no power to manipulate promotions and demotions. He presented a performance evaluation form in court as proof. Witness Liu Shaokui and others also testified that the complainant accused each official of sending bribes of no less than 10 million yuan for promotion, but in reality, a promotion would only increase the salary by more than 100,000 yuan, which is impossible. After the questioning, they were ordered to return, pending further investigation.

### A Brawl at the Ruyi Teahouse: A Debt Collection Turns Violent

Unexpectedly, as soon as they went upstairs, they heard shouts of "Hit them!" Shen realized something was wrong and hurriedly went downstairs. However, more than a dozen thugs were waiting. With a shout to attack, Shen Xiangxing and his friends were seized and beaten. Shen suffered severe head and back injuries from stabs with sharp weapons. The Songshan Police Station was notified and dispatched a large number of officers to suppress the violence. The assailants had scattered, but suspect Zhu A'liu was apprehended.

### Two Fronts: Electoral Scene in Changhua, Western Zhejiang

[Our Newspaper's Special Dispatch from Changhua] The first lesson in elections has generated a unique interest among the 45,000 voters in Changhua, western Zhejiang. This is not because all voters understand their electoral rights, but because of the heated competition among candidates. For months, a thick electoral atmosphere has enveloped every village corner. "What Wang Xuequan is doing, what Chen Yi is doing..." has become a common topic during tea breaks.

Colorful Propaganda Slogans

Colorful propaganda slogans, joint endorsements of so-and-so, small printed leaflets, and temporary mimeographed publications such as "Election News" and "Democracy," mostly contain opinions on the election. However, due to differences in stance, there are mutual attacks and insults. You paste, I tear; you tear, I paste again, fully demonstrating a "fearless spirit" and a "relentless killing power."

Delayed Distribution of Voter Certificates

According to the Election and Recall Law, voter certificates should be issued to voters 20 days before the election. However, this was not the case in Changhua. The Election Office issued them only three days before the election. Some voters in remote areas did not receive their voter certificates by the time the election started. Some say that the election of National Assembly representatives has already been postponed for a month; otherwise, it would have become even more of a joke.

Many Certificates Without County Seals

Whether due to the negligence of election officials or other reasons, many voter certificates issued to voters were not stamped with the county seal. Many certificates also had different numbers than those on the voter registry. Furthermore, some people received two or more voter certificates with the same name and number. The first two situations resulted in the cancellation of voting rights, while the latter added an extra vote.

Pleasing Titles Unknown Beforehand

Some voter certificates were stamped with wooden stamps reading "Participating in Women's Elections" and "Participating in Farmers' Association Elections." Who were members of the Women's Association and who were members of the Farmers' Association? They themselves did not know they had such beautiful and pleasing titles beforehand. However, they did not appreciate it and accused the Women's Association and the Social Affairs Section of arbitrarily creating membership lists, believing it was equivalent to "raping public opinion." Coincidentally, many of these so-called members were voters favorable to candidate Wang Xuequan.

Active Campaigns by Wang and Chen

There are a total of seven candidates, but only Wang Xuequan and Chen Yi are actively campaigning. Therefore, the main activity is focused on Wang and Chen.

Mysterious Management of 19 Ballot Boxes

Each of the county's 19 ballot boxes is managed and supervised by seven people. In addition to personnel from the Party headquarters, the county government, and township offices, many are employees of the Zhejiang Provincial Grain and Food Administration (candidate Chen Yi is currently the director). Truly fair and impartial local gentry are not qualified to be hired. This mysterious personnel arrangement has led everyone to harbor an unresolved mystery about the Election Office.

Generous Act: 30,000 for One Vote

It seems very difficult to win a vote. Thus, news spread in the villages: "30,000 yuan per vote, 20,000 yuan per vote, scribes receive 2,000 yuan per vote..." In today's extremely depleted rural economy, someone generously gives money, benefiting the public. A benevolent act! A benevolent act!

Vote For Me Or Face Conscription

"If you don't vote for so-and-so, you'll be conscripted. If you don't vote for so-and-so, you'll..." This poses a great threat to the gullible and kind people, and public opinion has been emasculated.

I'll Grind Ink For You For My Brother's Sake

Election regulations stipulate that no one can monitor the area where votes are cast. However, there are exceptions. Chen Liang, the head of Yukuan Township and the elder brother of candidate Chen Yi, serves as a ballot inspector at the 12th polling station in the township. He goes to great lengths to grind ink for you, hand you a pen... and only relaxes after you have written "Chen Yi" correctly. Who can say he is not following the rules? Who can say he lacks a spirit of service?

Ballot Boxes Moved and Sealed Early

Regulations stipulate that ballot boxes cannot be moved for three days during the election. However, some ballot boxes were miraculously moved from Village A to Village B. The election was originally scheduled to end at a certain time, but some ballot boxes were sealed before the deadline. Thus, many voters helplessly gave up their votes.

Passionate Hometown Students Roar in Frustration

College students and those working in various agencies and organizations from Changhua along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou line returned to their hometowns in droves to volunteer for the election. They are all passionate and righteous young people. They demand that County Magistrate Wu firmly uphold a fair stance, uphold justice, and that local leaders jointly establish a solid democratic foundation and foster a good electoral atmosphere. However, reality has greatly disappointed them, so they are frustrated and roar! However, you can be frustrated and you can roar, but those in power adopt the attitude of "Let people laugh and scold, I'll do what I want." They ignore your frustration and don't hear your roaring!

Two Fronts, One Conclusion

Due to the fierce competition between Wang and Chen, Changhua has clearly formed two fronts. Before it is announced who is elected, there is already such criticism: "One side is glorious even in defeat, the other side is defeated even in victory." (Special Correspondent Fang Zheng)

### Boat Capsizes at Jiaoshan, Five Drown, Three Bodies Recovered

[Our Newspaper's Zhenjiang Dispatch, 6th] Several wooden boats from Taierzhuang, loaded with coal and arrowhead, passed through Guazhou yesterday and were sailing to the Jiaoshan area in the river. Due to the rough waves, three boats unfamiliar with the terrain were unfortunately overturned by the waves. Neighboring boats, upon hearing the news, rescued the boatmen who had fallen into the water from two boats. However, all five people on the other boat drowned. The Provincial Police Bureau's Water Police Team dispatched many personnel to search and recovered the bodies of two men and one woman. Two more bodies have been swept away by the waves. A national identity card bearing the name Liu Jibiao was found near one of the male bodies, along with five million legal tender yuan. After inquiring with the shipping company, it was learned that the deceased were a family of three, traveling to Wuxi. Their younger brother's boat had arrived in Wuxi earlier.

### Students of the Municipal Teachers College Petitioned the Bureau of Education Yesterday: The Resumption of Classes Has Not Been Decided

[Our Newspaper's Report] Students of the Municipal Teachers College in this city have been on strike for several days, demanding reasonable treatment. After sending representatives to petition the Bureau of Education yesterday, the issue remains unresolved.

Director Li of the Bureau of Education met with Xie Engao, the director of secondary education of the bureau, yesterday afternoon to talk to the student representatives and urged them to resume classes immediately.

Li and Xie listened to the representatives and replied point by point: The school reported that it had already exhausted the funds to be reissued, and now the bureau has decided to send personnel to check the food accounts for the two months together with the students; The Bureau of Education and the Municipal Government cannot be responsible, and the Executive Yuan has been requested to approve it; It is wrong for the school to use student public funds to pay the salaries of the cooks and a thorough investigation will be conducted. In addition, the student representatives requested that the public funds for this month be overdrafted immediately so that they can start meals because there is no funding for meals at present. Director Li agreed to discuss it with the school and issue it all before the 10th of this month. The students finally stated that according to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, teachers college students should be exempt from all fees except for the student union membership fee, but each student at the school is required to pay 560,000 yuan in tuition fees this semester, which is higher than the tuition fees paid by teachers college students across the country. The bureau is also requested to conduct a thorough investigation. Li believed that it was within the scope of the Ministry of Education and did not give a specific answer. The student representatives returned to the school late at night. As for whether to resume classes today, it will be decided after the general meeting of the student union this morning.

### Li Huitang Caused a Sensation in Kunming (Continued Conclusion) Talking About Participating in the World Games Football Preliminary Round

Talking About Participating in the World Games

Li Huitang was very busy in Kunming with games and social events. The reporter seized an opportunity to have a long conversation with him. He said, "Regarding participation in next year's World Games, China is probably still going to participate in a 'tourist' capacity. This isn't meant to be discouraging, but it's the truth!" Then he talked specifically about the situation in Chinese football. It's undeniable that China has too few true sports talents. The eight years of the War of Resistance had a great impact.

The "King of Football" talked about his previous participation in the World Games, the situation of facing the British football team, and the experience of traveling to nine countries. It truly evoked a sense of vicissitudes. Seeing that the World Games were about to be held again next year, Dr. Rong Qizhao was appointed as the football team leader, and Li Huitang, Yu Hengzhi, Zhou Jiaqi, Huang Jiajun and other five people were appointed as football player selection committee members. This work is scheduled to be completed in February of the 37th year. After that, they will need to concentrate on training in Hong Kong, and at the latest, they hope to depart from the country in mid-April. This time, they plan to change the route, not passing through the Nanyang Islands, but through the Philippines, New Zealand, and various places in South America, because they can take this opportunity to practice and observe, to learn from. The proceeds from the ticket sales of matches along the way will supplement.

### Selection of Representatives

Regarding the selection of players, Li's personal opinion is that the Shanghai team will have a maximum of five people selected, and the Malayan team may have four selected. The majority of the players will still be located in Hong Kong. The football team may select eighteen to twenty people. The selection criteria this time will be relatively strict, and they are willing to select more young "newcomers" and are unwilling to let "old players" monopolize this team. This opinion is very valuable.

Finally, he mentioned that it would be best for the Chinese football team to have a special plane for this trip abroad, to save time and preserve the players' physical strength. They do not plan to go by sea again. Currently, they are negotiating with the China National Aviation Corporation, and there are not many problems. The company also expressed its willingness to help. The second issue is the team members' food. It is necessary to plan in advance because the British "rationing system" is strictly enforced. Each person only gets one egg and one quart of butter per week. If that is the case, the "King of Football" said with a smile, "then the Chinese players will not be able to play." Therefore, within the possible range, they plan to transport more white rice and store more vegetables to avoid not being able to find anything to eat at the last minute.

He believes that the national team's score in this World Games is likely to be very low. As long as football can maintain its past glory, it will be as desired. According to the current results of other sports, Lou Wen'ao's 10,000-meter race may rank fifth, assuming there are no new changes in the world rankings.

We talked too much, and the reporter excused himself from his tightly grasped hand. (Our correspondent in Kunming, Xu Jilian)

### Cotton Commercial Association Hosts Various Sectors, States Eight Wishes of Cotton Merchants, Joint Meeting of Various Parties Related to Cotton Yarn and Cloth to be Held

[Our report] The Municipal Cotton Commercial Association hosted various sectors yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM on the sixth floor of the China Merchants Bureau regarding the "National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Measures" passed by the Executive Yuan at its meeting on December 23rd of last year. About a hundred people attended, including Pan Gongqing, Yang Guanbei, Yan Esheng, Pan Shihao, Ma Junshuo, Wang Qiyu, Shi Fengxiang, Liu Piji, and directors, supervisors, and members of the association. The atmosphere at the meeting was particularly激昂. Finally, the leaders of all parties related to cotton yarn and cloth advocated for the regular convening of a joint conversation meeting so that, within the scope of legitimate steps to fight for the survival of the industry, they could jointly draft appropriate opinions and contribute them to the relevant government authorities for adoption and implementation. The meeting was adjourned at around 6:00 PM. The main points of the meeting are recorded as follows:

Cotton Merchants Should Not Lose Their Jobs, Existing Cotton Should Be Purchased at a Reasonable Price

First, Liu 　Sun, Chairman of the Association, and Zheng Zhecheng, Executive Director, delivered speeches respectively, stating the eight wishes of cotton merchants after the unified purchase of raw cotton, as follows: According to the interpretation of Article 15 of the Constitution, the cotton yarn and cloth management measures have clearly restricted the working rights of cotton merchants. Also, according to Article 172 of the Constitution, "Orders that conflict with the Constitution are invalid." The implementation of the unified purchase order deserves attention. Cotton merchants are distributors, and according to Section 3 of Section 2 of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Measures, "The cotton collected by cotton merchants in cotton-producing areas shall be sold entirely to the cotton collection agencies of the association at the prices stipulated by the association." It is recognized that cotton merchants have the right to collect cotton in the producing areas, and it is not permissible to change the order through discussions. Furthermore, since there is currently a need for urgent purchase, in addition to entrusting the Textile Construction Company, why not simultaneously accommodate cotton merchants to participate in the urgent purchase? Cotton merchants have a long history, with firms and branches established in cotton-producing areas across the country, specializing in raw material procurement and transportation. Cotton merchants have made contributions to the country during wartime and after the restoration, and they have suffered huge losses. They have the right to demand that the state guarantee their survival. The cotton collection branches of the Textile Construction Company in various places are mostly located in larger distribution markets in cities, and their cotton sources are supplied by cotton merchants. Cotton merchants specialize in operations and are fully responsible, which is better than entrusting them to purchase on their behalf. Since the authorities decided to unify the purchase of raw cotton, the cotton merchants' existing cotton could not be sold, resulting in even greater losses. The cotton merchants' current businesses are completely shut down, and their costs are exhausted. Delaying too long will make it impossible to salvage the situation. Cotton merchants request three points: (A) "Legitimate cotton merchants must not be made unemployed." (B) The existing cotton of cotton merchants should be purchased immediately with funds at a reasonable price. (C) Cotton merchants should be allowed to collect and transport the cotton needed by the yarn factories not designated for spinning by the Yarn Management Committee.

Chairman Pan Supports Two Principles: Guaranteeing Employment and Assisting Production

Chairman Pan of the Municipal Council said briefly: It is rumored that the Yarn Management Committee will temporarily entrust the Textile Construction Company to purchase cotton on its behalf. I hope this is just a rumor. If it is true, then from the current standpoint of suppressing bandits and economic suppression, I will oppose it. The communists are causing chaos and destruction everywhere, while the government aims to actively promote construction and production. In this situation, as long as cotton merchants can sell the collected cotton to the unified collection agency at the stipulated price, the Yarn Management Committee has no reason to reject the livelihood of cotton merchants, allowing the originally skilled cotton collectors to become unemployed and increasing social instability. The most important thing now is to guarantee people's employment and to assist national production. All "suspension" laws that violate one of these two principles will ultimately be impossible to implement. Now that the country has implemented the Constitution, I deeply believe that the industrial and commercial sectors will sincerely support reasonable policies. Otherwise, they should appeal and provide legitimate demands, suggesting that the authorities adopt them. I think that the responsible authorities should also consider adopting them.

Yang Guanbei, Executive Director of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Pan Shihao, Chairman of the Association of Reproduction Industries, Yan Esheng, Secretary-General of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Cotton Spinning Association of the Six Districts, Shi Fengxiang, Director, and Liu Piji were all invited to deliver speeches separately, expressing their sympathy for the plight of the cotton merchants.

### Unified Bonds and Foreign Stocks Rise

Yesterday, buying interest in public bonds continued to expand amidst the currency system issue. The Unified C opened at 39,000 yuan, rising to 49,000 yuan, and then rebounding. About 9 million yuan was traded, with the combined increase for A and B being 8,700 yuan compared to the previous close, Unified C rising by 11,000 yuan, Type D rising by 8,300 yuan, and Unified E opening well at 8,000 yuan.

Yesterday afternoon, foreign stocks began to rise. Speculation on foreign exchange arose again, and the black market fueled buying interest. Popular stocks consistently reached new highs. Yisha started at 450,000 yuan and gradually rose to close at 515,000 yuan. Small banks provided supply, while securities brokers from the Guangdong and Jiangsu regions were buyers. As a result, compared to the previous close, reclamation was flat, shipping rose by 15%, trams rose by 5%, and the remaining stocks all rose by about 10%.

Imports of Rice, Cotton, Flour, Coal, etc. Will No Longer Be Settled at the Official Exchange Rate

[Our report] Regarding the settlement of foreign exchange for imports of American cotton, rice, wheat flour, coking coal, etc., the Business Bureau of the Central Bank notified all designated banks on January 5th that, starting this month, the above-mentioned materials should be settled at the market price of the Stabilization Fund. The original text of the notice stated: "Having received an order from the Executive Yuan, effective from this month, all foreign exchange for imported cotton, rice, wheat flour, and coking coal with import permits shall be converted at the market price of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee, and may no longer be converted at the official price. Section 5 (A) of the previous circular is hereby revoked." All designated banks have complied with the order.

Food Prices Generally Rise, Oil Market Cannot Meet Demand

Yesterday, a total of 15,200 shih of rice and grain arrived in the North and South markets. Internal land saw a resurgence, people's minds were agitated, and prices rose, with all goods experiencing a comprehensive rise. Japonica rice and Yuan rice both rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, slightly slackening near the close. Flour rose endlessly, rising linearly, continuing to surge by 20,000 yuan. Wheat bran soared, continuing to rise by 10,000 yuan. Bean cake rose to the clouds, surging by 20,000 yuan, approaching the 300,000 yuan mark. Soybean buyers changed direction, with local merchants taking it in, and oil factories purchasing vigorously. Dahuang rebounded by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and guest beans increased sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.

Mung beans are being purchased by North China, with demand exceeding supply. Scarcity makes it precious, flying up by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Red beans, with retail conversion, surged by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Soybeans followed suit, rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Although cowpeas were transacted slowly, the owners were firm, rising slightly by 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum was being eagerly acquired by distilleries, rebounding by 20,000 yuan. Corn was being purchased smoothly by North China, recovering from fatigue and rebounding by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were transacted sluggishly by the Guangxi region, and the local merchants were also sluggish. High-quality goods rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, while mid-tier goods remained average. Sesame was in a fluctuating and oscillating state. White sesame rebounded by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, while black sesame was rare and suddenly surged by 200,000 yuan.

Oil prices generally rose, with stores strengthening and demand exceeding supply. Crude oil and soybean oil surged by over 200,000 yuan, and clear oil followed suit, rising by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil and Su oil surged by over 200,000 yuan one after another.

### Yarn Management Committee Adjusts Negotiated Prices Again, Cotton Yarn Soars

[Our report] The Yarn Management Committee was approved yesterday to adjust the negotiated price of cotton yarn. 20-count yarn was re-listed at 33 million yuan, an increase of 11.8% compared to the previous level. The prices of other counts of yarn were adjusted proportionally.

The committee continued to sell yarn in the cotton yarn market yesterday, selling a total of 1,227 pieces, equivalent to 1,718 pieces of 20-count yarn. A total of 161 applicants applied. The selling price of 20-count yarn ranged from 34.5 million yuan for Ruyi, Red Bee, and Golden Yuanbao brands to 36.1 million yuan for Golden Chicken brand. 6-count vice-sunlight yarn was 17 million yuan. 32-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 47.1 million yuan, 40-count Sunlight yarn was 52.8 million yuan, and 42-count double-strand Blue Phoenix yarn was 59.8 million yuan.

The Textile Construction Company also sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 945 pieces, equivalent to 1,649 pieces of 20-count yarn. There were a total of 506 applications.

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was characterized by the Textile Construction Company's yarn sales and the increase in allocation prices, which boosted people's spirits. Local reproduction manufacturers absorbed vigorously, and buyers from other regions were still eager. Owners took the opportunity to hold on and were unwilling to let go easily, and the market showed a state of demand exceeding supply. The asking price soared. The highest price for 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn broke through the 60 million yuan mark, reaching 60.2 million yuan. By the close, due to some floating profits being realized, the price fell back to close at 60 million yuan, an increase of 2.5 million yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, all other counts of coarse and fine yarn also followed, rising by 800,000 to 1.2 million to 3 million or more yuan.

Cloth is Firm

The cotton cloth market opened with a lively atmosphere in the morning. Although the Textile Construction Company had a large supply, the increase in the allocation price of yarn caused people to suddenly report firmness. Local merchants absorbed, and colleagues replenished at low prices. Furthermore, merchants from Hankou brought cash to Shanghai to purchase, and merchants from the North and Guangxi regions especially absorbed. The prices of all cloth stores created unprecedented highs. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was quoted at 1.515 million to 545,000 yuan on the open market, and it was difficult to collect. It was also quoted as high as 1.6 million yuan, an increase of about 90,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 5-inch Blue Chicken Zhenzhong and other fine cloth also rose by 40,000, 50,000, and 60,000 yuan. All other cloths also rose across the board.

### Silk Rises All the Way

Yesterday, the artificial silk market showed its brilliance again. 120-count Asahi brand shiny silk opened in the morning as high as 102 million yuan, and buying interest did not wane. It rose step by step. By the close of the morning session, the spot price had reached 109 million yuan. It rose further in the afternoon, reaching a maximum of 112 million yuan, before falling back to 110 million yuan, an increase of 14 million yuan compared to the previous day's price.

Raw Silk

Yesterday's market was boosted by the high price of rayon, and people's spirits were high, with prices rising across the board. In the morning, B-grade goods were traded at 101 million yuan, C-grade goods at 99 million yuan, and D-grade goods at 8 million yuan. High-grade goods were offered at 7 million yuan, and trading was quite brisk. In the afternoon, another peak was seen. The price of CD-grade goods was around 104 million yuan, but there were no transactions. Several loads of high-grade goods were offered at 102 million yuan. The route for dried warp silk was relatively slow, and yesterday's market opened 3 to 4 million yuan higher.

Silk Fabrics

Yesterday's market was due to the high price of raw materials. Manufacturers have raised factory prices due to cost factors. The Huaqiang true silk quilt covers were still relatively stable in the morning, opening at around 8.5 million yuan, closing at 8.15 million yuan spot, and 8.4 million yuan for next-day delivery. The afternoon showed a high surge, and off-market transactions reached 9.5 million yuan. The Dacheng order for checkered crepe was quoted at 158,000 yuan in the morning and 165,000 yuan in the afternoon. Minsheng 45 crepe satin opened at 245,000 yuan, and Huajin crepe feather yarn, etc., were all 5,000 yuan higher than the previous day.

The Market's Buying Interest Boils, Chinese Stocks Advance Rapidly to a Peak

Chinese stocks were buoyant in the morning. Overnight reports stated that food and daily necessities would be settled at market exchange rates, and the black market began to stir. People's minds were like boiling water, and Yong Yarn repeatedly reached new highs. Most of the remaining stocks were limit-up, with extremely good profits.

At the opening of the morning session, people's minds were unsettled. Xinyi and Jinglun were again announced to be limit-up. The remaining stocks were just mediocre. Except for Yong Yarn, which debuted at 628 yuan, next-day Yong Yarn even opened lower at 623 yuan. After the opening, next-day Yong Yarn saw 626 yuan, but there were more immediate and next-day deliveries, falling to a low of 612 yuan for both spot and next-day deliveries. Off-market interest rates opened high at 2 jiao 4 and 2 jiao 8 and a half fen, and there was still weakness. Underwear was listed as limit-up, and Yong Yarn rose to 620 yuan, but there were more sellers and a low price of 610 yuan was seen. At this time, speculation about foreign exchange rates arose again, and traders rose to the occasion and pushed up prices. Near noon, the upward momentum strengthened, and Huaxin was pushed to limit-up. At the noon close, Yong Yarn was pulled up to a high price of 637 yuan and 640 yuan. After the close, the asking price was slightly lower. As a result, compared to the previous close, Huaxin, Xinyi, Jinglun, and Underwear stocks for immediate delivery were limit-up, Huafeng and Zhongfa rose by 10%, Shangwu and Datong were flat, Rongfeng was slightly higher, Yonggong was up by half a percent, and the rest were negligibly up or down. Huafeng stocks for next-day delivery rose by 10%, Qinxing slightly declined, Xinguang was flat, and the rest were slightly higher.

In the afternoon, next-day delivery was suspended as usual. Overnight reports stated that food and daily necessities would be settled at market exchange rates, and people's spirits were boosted. Yong Yarn opened and rose to 642 yuan, advancing to 6505 yuan. In addition to Xinyi, Huaxin, and Jinglun being limit-up, Huafeng, Yongye, Zhongfa, Shangwu, Yonggong, Zhongsi, Xinhua Match, Zhongni, Mei Ya, and Shunxu were also listed as limit-up. Although Yong Yarn was sold at 645 yuan, it was still seen advancing further. The stimulation from outside the industry increased greatly. Although the national banks intervened, new high prices of 661 yuan were still created. Due to some profit-taking at high prices, the closing price was 655 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, Huaxin, Xinyi, Meiya, Zhongsi, Huafeng, Match, Jinglun, Yonggong, Zhaian, Zhongni, Underwear, Zhongfa, and Yongye stocks were limit-up. Xinhua and Shangwu rose after being limit-up, each rising by more than 10%. Yong Yarn rose slightly, while the rest opened half a percent to 10% higher. The prices of various old stocks in the off-market market rose again across the board.

Freight and Handling Charges Increase Sharply, Taiwan Sugar Raises Allocation Prices

[Our report] Taiwan Sugar Company is currently facing sharply increased freight and handling charges. The current sugar price is insufficient to cover the sugar cost. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs' 20th Sugar Price Council approved yesterday a general increase of 235,000 yuan per level for Taiwan Sugar. It is also determined to be implemented from the second period of sugar allocation this year (i.e., starting today).

Publishing Industry

### Reading "Who's Who in America"

— Yang Shi

Shanghai will soon have a book similar to "Who's Who in Shanghai" published. Editing such a book is always a thankless task. Either the celebrities in the book accuse it of "not being true to the facts," or readers consider it to be praising and glorifying them. Therefore, we would like to introduce the publication of "Who's Who in America" to those who continue to read, to see how serious and fair they are in editing this magnificent work, and also to learn how they overcome some unexpected difficulties. This will provide some reference and lessons for publishers and editors engaged in "Who's Who."

In the latest issue of "Who's Who," more than 3,500 celebrities are introduced to the American people and even the people of the world. Although there are no medals, rewards, or eulogies, they are honored enough to be listed in this most prestigious book in the world. This honor cannot be bought with money. Many people have tried to bribe to be listed in the celebrity biography, and some have used any means to have their biography recorded in the book, but all have been "rejected" by the rigorous and anonymous editors. When the book was first edited, many celebrities, upon receiving the editor's questionnaire, claimed that unless the publisher gave them a high fee, they would not be willing to fill in their life story in the questionnaire. However, when the editors explained that this book was not for profit and that no wealthy merchant could buy a page in it with money, they quickly filled out the form for the editors.

The yearbook is published every two years. In the past 46 years, 23 issues have been published. They can honestly say that not a single word has been written because of bribery. Assuming that this glorious masterpiece, weighing six and a half pounds, was like other counterfeit "celebrity biographies," casually used by the wealthy to praise and promote them, its publisher could have a million US dollars in revenue in two issues. However, they were not used by money, and their remuneration was less than that of a junior clerk. Only about 30 of the more than 1,000 editorial board members received salaries.

Due to the editors' diligence and rigor, this book is welcomed by readers all over the United States and has a high reputation in various countries. Recently, a senior US government official visited the Turkish cabinet general and this book was prominently placed on his bookshelf. In fact, news agencies, newspapers, government officials, and even the presidential palace in various countries also have this book, because it is a book that truly introduces American celebrities.

The criteria for selecting "celebrities" are very high, and they are selected in two categories: first, those who have special achievements and prestige in their work; and second, those who are important due to their position, such as senior government officials. As for those who are particularly agile in physiology, or major criminals, or celebrities in special positions, are not included in the selection. Therefore, there are no athletes, boxers, or leading figures in circuses in this book, unless they have special fame in other aspects. The editorial board members use all their ingenuity to seek the truth. Errors do exist, such as some people who have bought doctoral degrees with money. Once found out, they are immediately removed from the list and will never be selected again. Each department has a nomination committee, which repeatedly assesses and then sends it to the chief editorial committee for discussion. The members are anonymous, so as not to be influenced by anyone. Due to the importance of the responsibility, once a celebrity who has been selected leaves his position, his name will be removed from the book. The deceased are compiled into a separate obituary column. Roosevelt's biographical questionnaire was sent to the editors a few days before his death, so he has been listed in the obituary column, and his biography will naturally not be included in the next issue of the yearbook.

During the war, the US Army and Navy were greatly expanded, and a number of newly rising generals were increasing every day, and their activities also expanded to all parts of the world. This brought great difficulties to the editing of the yearbook. Their mailing addresses changed three times a day, and their activities were also changing every day, making it impossible for the publishers to catch up with these heroes on the battlefield. For example, the questionnaires returned by General Patton and General Clark, who marched into Germany, were late as usual, because when they were about to mail them, they had to add new activities. Among the questionnaires received, the fastest to be received were those newly selected celebrities. The more famous the people, the simpler the answers. The questionnaires from university presidents or college deans were mostly long essays with pretentious wording. As for government officials, they were even more lengthy and annoying. Of course, the length of the biography in the yearbook does not affect his true importance and fame. Some celebrities with strange tempers simply do not write their life stories to the editorial board members, so the editors have to ask someone close to him to write it, but add a small note in the book page and write a very tactful letter to the celebrity to explain the intention of publishing this yearbook. Some celebrities also asked the editors not to delete the original text of the biography he sent, but due to the need to save pages and not make it too long, they had to explain it tactfully. There are many such special conditions proposed to the editors. Several people claimed that unless a certain time had passed, he could not send back the filled-in biography, because after this time, he might have a son or get married, meaning that he wanted to write his wife and son in his biography. In the yearbook, the truth of age is also a headache, mostly women are the most difficult to deal with, especially female stars and actresses, they will use the same age in several issues, but this is not too important.

Since the first issue of the yearbook was published in 1899, they have collected a lot of valuable celebrity handwriting and photos, and more signatures. According to the editors, in order to maintain the excellent tradition of this great publication for half a century, these valuable things can only be stored, not sold or made public. The editorial department is located in Chicago, they have no retail store, and the selling price of the yearbook is not high, because they are not for the purpose of making money.

### Supplement to the "Chronological Table of Works and Birth and Death Years of Scholars in the Qing Dynasty"

— Ji Dan

In the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, I purchased a book compiled by Mr. Xiao Yishan in Beiping, "Chronological Table of Works and Birth and Death Years of Scholars in the Qing Dynasty". The entry for Li Youtang, the author of "Chronicle of Events in the History of Liao and Jin Dynasties", was missing his birth and death dates. I have long wanted to correct it, but the war put an end to it. Mr. Xiao's compilation of this book, together with his "General History of the Qing Dynasty", are both world-renowned works, and republication with revisions is imminent. Now, based on what I know, I will describe Mr. Li's birth, death and place of origin as follows for reference and selection.

Mr. Li's given name was Youtang, and his courtesy name was Feisheng. He was from Pingxiang, Jiangxi. He was born on the 15th day of the second month of the Dingyou year of Daoguang (1837) and died on the 18th day of the seventh month of the Yiyi year of Guangxu (1905). He was a tribute student in the Jiazi year of Tongzhi (1864) and went to the capital in the Yichou year (1865) to take the imperial examination. He was admitted to the Eight Banners Official School as a teaching apprentice and was awarded the title of Instructor. In the Gengyin year of Guangxu (1890), he was selected to be the Instructor of Xiajiang County, and also managed education. In the Guiyi year (1893), he resigned due to his parents' old age. This book was also completed in that year and printed with movable type. This was the first edition. According to the preface written by Mr. Li's younger brother, Youfen (Xiangyuan):

"The Chronicle of Events in the History of Liao and Jin Dynasties, a total of ninety-two volumes, was sent by my elder brother Feisheng from Xiajiang. I have read the preface and written a general introduction. I have taken the books of Yuan and Chen and read them extensively, connecting the cumulative series. Only the Liao and Jin dynasties have not been compiled. In the past, the officials of the Siku Quanshu included the Liao and Jin dynasties in the Chronicle of Events in the History of the Song Dynasty, saying that it should be called the Chronicle of Events of the Three Dynasties, and should not be named Song Dynasty alone, criticizing its prejudice. I have examined Chen's book, and there is much involvement of the two countries, but it is still a compilation of the Song Dynasty, and the name is not wrong. This is just a superficial argument. However, recording the Liao and Jin dynasties is different from other histories. The names and official titles of the people are not familiar with translation, and one person appears repeatedly, and there are many historical errors. Moreover, the history was compiled casually, the selection was not extensive, there were many omissions, and there were occasional ink errors. The difficulty of following up and writing is not easy. Previous people asked for things, and only left this compilation. It is really not a matter of dealing with the separate departments and starting and ending the group. My elder brother's compilation started in the Jiashen year (1884) and has been in compilation for a decade."

In the Yiyi year (1895), it was reprinted in Shanghai with lithography, combining the original "Seven Kinds of Chronicle of Events" in the middle box edition into nine, which was the reprinted edition, and it was slightly revised. In his later years, Mr. Li revised and supplemented the entire book, and it was carved and reprinted in the GuiMao winter (1903), and it took a year to complete the storage. This was the final edition. At the end of the book, a new preface was written by Mr. Li's cousin, Yu (Xiaoyuan):

"In the past, those who wrote books often left out selections, and they always disliked being brief. My father spent more than ten years of hard work searching for books, starting in the official residence of Xiajiang. In the Guiyi year (1893), my father was assigned to patrol Gao Lian, and sent it to the office. At that time, Yu changed his official status to Shuchang and went to Guangdong Province to meet. With his brothers, he divided the company into Xiangxiao, and gave it to the people to print. ... Later, because his energy did not decline, and he had leisure time, he re-edited it. He saw that the two dynasties' regulations and golden inscriptions had not been collected, and he could not bear to part with them. There were some errors in the sentences, and my father specialized in adding and supplementing them, and the translators corrected them. The system remained the same, and things were complete, so that it could be more and more complete, hoping to avoid regrets. Yu believes that ancient famous scholars and sages did not tire of seeking details in their works. Even Zhu Xi of Kaoting also had books of final conclusions in his later years, but the compilation from the door is not as good as the correction by hand."

Mr. Gu Jiaxiang of Kuaiji said in his Tang Reading Notes:

"The Chronicle of Events category has always had Zuo Zhuan, Tongjian, Song History, Yuan History, Ying Qin History, and Ming History Chronicle of Events. Liao and Jin were not compiled because they were biased, but they were not covered by the Song History. Moreover, they have long been listed in the official history, and the Chronicle of Events should not be missing. Youtang created these two books, which were unprecedented. The first draft was carved in Pingxiang, and I once ordered workers to print it. This edition was lithographed in Shanghai by his nephew, Taishi Xiaotan. There was also a revised edition in his later years, which I have not seen."

Also, in the Four Concubine Pavilion Poetry Collection (unpublished draft) of Mr. Liu Youfu of Ji'an, there are four chapters of "Li Feisheng, a scholar of the Hanlin Academy, sent me the Chronicle of Events of Liao and Jin Dynasties, and I wrote it as a thank you." One sentence in the second chapter says: "How many times has the linen yarn been proofread, and now the original and the end are twice as clear." A note below says: "This book has been revised three times." One sentence in the fourth chapter says: "A bundle of Langhan has been sent repeatedly, and it is still necessary to use Bian Ku to expect each other." A note below says: "I sent a copy for correction during the reprint." All of the above are sufficient to prove it. As for the last time this book was carved, although it has gone through turmoil in the past forty years, it is still preserved as it is today.

### Chinese Book Cataloging Method

— Lu Fengtai

Compiled by Lou Yunlin, published by Zhonghua Book Company

Recently, in the Chinese library community, two books on cataloging have been published one after another. One is "Okazaki Book Cataloging" compiled by Mr. Jin Minfu, published by Zhengzhong Book Company in the 35th year of the Republic of China, and the other is "Chinese Okazaki Book Cataloging Method" compiled by Mr. Lou Yunlin, published by Zhonghua Book Company in June of the 36th year of the Republic of China.

Compared with Mr. Jin's "Okazaki Book Cataloging," it can be said that Mr. Jin's book focuses on a general review of the cataloging work methods of various books. This book, in addition to the general book cataloging method, provides detailed explanations of the cataloging methods of rare books, local chronicles, Okazaki yearbooks, and periodical publications. This can be said to be the characteristic of this book.

As a cultural institution, if its internal scope is large and its history is long, then in addition to ordinary circulating books, there are more or less rare books in its collection. As for local chronicles, annual reports, and periodicals, they are common to libraries of all sizes. However, there has never been a detailed cataloging method for this type of special book for reference.

Cataloging is one of the most cumbersome tasks in library operations, and cataloging rare books is the most difficult part of this cumbersome task. Now, Mr. Lou's book happens to solve this problem. In Chapter 5, the examination of rare books, the version, the examination of volumes, the style, the identification of fonts, the abstract of chapters and symbols, the examination of marks, the identification of paper quality and ink color, the description of binding, and the record of collections and Danhuang are all explained in detail in separate sections. With this chapter, the difficult problem of cataloging rare books can be easily solved.

Newspapers and magazines have become an important part of our daily life in modern life, because in addition to reporting news, all kinds of novel and important materials related to culture and academics are scattered in various newspapers and magazines. Therefore, scholars since modern times have used newspapers and magazines as one of the important materials for learning. A library, regardless of its size, subscribes to hundreds of newspapers, or dozens. However, in the past, the cataloging method for this type of newspaper was not detailed, so that the cultural and academic materials scattered in various newspapers could not be fully utilized. This book also explains the newspaper cataloging method and the military chapter catalog index method in detail.

The whole book is 226 pages long and is divided into eight chapters. Chapter 1 General Outline. Chapter 2 Brief Description of Book Classification. Chapter 3 General Book Cataloging Method, Chapter 4 How to Write Card Catalogs, Chapter 5 Rare Book Cataloging Method, Chapter 6 Cataloging Methods for Local Chronicles, Annual Reports, etc., Chapter 7 Periodical Cataloging Method, Chapter 8 Reference Books on Cataloging.

### "The Sorrows of an Inventor"

— Lu Xian

Written by Balzac, translated by Gao Mingkai

"The Sorrows of an Inventor" is one of Balzac's "Illusions Perdues Trilogy." The other two are "Two Poets" and "A Great Man from the Provinces in Paris." I have read all of Balzac's "Celibates Trilogy," but I have read the least of this "Illusions Perdues Trilogy." Perhaps the reason is that I am a little afraid of watching tragedies, or perhaps it is because there are already too many illusory tragedies being staged in our real society, which makes people a little afraid of seeing the word "illusion."

But after I read "The Sorrows of an Inventor," I had a more ardent admiration for Balzac's great pen. — Balzac's "illusion" is not the "illusion" of people in a society where utilitarianism is prevalent; just as Lao Zhuang's nihilistic tendency is different from Russian nihilism.

The story is very simple: David, who has a scholarly demeanor, opened a printing factory, but handed over all the factory affairs to employees. He himself concentrated on the research of papermaking. If this diligent research is successful, it may enable him to obtain a lot of profit and get rich immediately. David is completely a thinker, an inventor, kind-hearted and simple-minded. Therefore, the papermaking technology has not yet been invented, and he himself has become the prey of the capitalist Goonder brothers' conspiracy. His brother-in-law Lucien also caused a minor disaster, implicating David and forcing the latter to flee and hide. But in the life of fleeing and hiding, David still kept thinking about the research of papermaking. If it were not for his wife Evie's pure love to support him, David's future would be unimaginable. Finally, under the resourceful mediation of the evil lawyer Bertie-Crow, David finally "reconciled" with the Goonder brothers. In other words, he willingly became the prey of the Goonder brothers. Although the research on papermaking was all successful, most of the profits fell into the hands of the Goonder brothers, and David himself became an employee of the Goonder brothers.

Writing about how capitalists use the magic of money to force inventors to bow their heads and become their slaves should be the theme of "The Sorrows of an Inventor." Naturally, the descriptions of the judicial system in France in the early 19th century, the unreasonableness of the law, and the dangerous schemes of lawyers should be the sub-themes of this book. In a short novel of more than 100,000 words, Balzac analyzed some of the dark sides of French provincial life with great talent. He arranged more than a dozen characters in this novel, such as David's straightforward scholarly demeanor, Evie's charming little wife's posture, old Schiel's (David's father) stinginess is very much like old Ge Tie, the servant Gorbon's loyalty, Serisi's cunning, the capitalist Goonder brothers' reed-like wit, the lawyer Bertie-Crow's "tolerance" and "ruthlessness," the dandy Luke's innocence and complacency, etc., almost all of them are typical characters. Among Balzac's famous works, the scene of "The Sorrows of an Inventor" may not be as good as "Cousin Bette" (translated by Mu Mutian, Commercial Press edition); the exquisiteness may not be as good as "Eugenie Grandet" (translated by Gao Mingkai, Haiyan edition), but in any case, this is after all a famous work of Balzac that directly faces the judicial system of France and loudly denounces it. Compared with "The Priest of Tours" and "La Rabouilleuse," I prefer "The Sorrows of an Inventor."

In the whole book, the most lovable characters are naturally David and Evie, a typical couple of kind intellectuals. Without Evie's delicacy, there would be no way to reflect David's straightforwardness. The two are indispensable. Lucien's naive and complacent posture makes people feel both pitiful and hateful. However, his wealthy behavior is not enough to cover up all the innocence in his heart. Therefore, under Balzac's pen, he is not a definitive character after all. When he knew that he had become the root of the disaster of the great operation, he decided to commit suicide in a daze. Balzac described this section of his departure in the middle of the night with extremely beautiful portrayal. Old priest Hora Carlos County is the only legendary character in the whole book. Just like Balzac's insertion of the great thief Vautrin in "Old Man Goriot," Balzac used the mouth of the Carlos priest to express his criticism of the money-worshiping society in France at that time. I am especially confused by his words:

"You have to change your behavior: please show your beauty, your elegance, your poetic talent. If you want to do some small bad things, you should do them within the four walls. Then, you will not have the crime of staining the ground on this stage called the world. Napoleon called this: "Washing clothes at home." From this we can draw a conclusion: everything is formal. Some people who have not been educated use force to rob others of a sum of money because of the pressure of needs; people call them criminals, and they have to be punished by law. A talented poor man finds a secret, the development of this secret is really equivalent to a treasure house, you borrow him three thousand francs, you give him a hard time, and you have to let him give up all the secrets to you, you only use your conscience to calculate, and your conscience will not bring you to the court to judge criminals..."

The priest then taught Lucien that to be a "big man" in society, first, he must not be afraid of shame; second, he must try his best to decorate his appearance; and third, he must do it secretly. He gave many examples to prove how Napoleon, Richelieu, and the Medicis climbed to high positions. Extrapolating from his theory, people naturally think of the nihilistic philosophy of the great thief Vautrin. In Balzac's novels, what these characters represent may be Balzac's "second self"; although his theory seems a little too cynical.

### "Refugee Emperor"

— Jing Wen

This winter relief relied on the efforts and donations of enthusiastic people, and the results were quite satisfactory. However, it may still be difficult to provide good help to the truly poor refugees who are about to die, because there is a group of fake refugees who live on refugees between them and the relief agency, that is, the so-called "refugee emperors." They prevent the relief goods from benefiting those who need relief, and fall into the pockets of local ruffians.

Usually, in a slum area, there is always a so-called "refugee representative" who manages all relief matters, applies for various donations on their behalf, collects fees for building sheds and digging holes, and receives liaison investigators - when any agency or group goes to visit and distribute relief, they come forward and pretend to be enthusiastic, and they also get in touch with fellow villagers' associations: but they treat the refugees with a ferocious face and harsh words. Poor kind farmers who have just been displaced to Shanghai from other towns have no relatives, and are unfamiliar with the place. Who can they complain to! It is difficult for them to receive the substantial benefits of the relief funds of hundreds of millions of dollars. On the contrary, they have to offer the daily begging income to the "representative." Often, the refugees can't even eat enough noodles, but the "representative" is full of fat and rice!

They rely on having been in Shanghai for many years. Some of them were originally local tyrants and evil gentry in the countryside. And many grassroots workers in relief work, such as Baojia chiefs, do not understand the language of the refugees, and some people are discouraged when they see such a dirty and smelly situation. So they push it to the "representative," and as a result, those parasites are leisurely and can do whatever they want.

They not only exploit the relief supplies and donations that are distributed, but also plan on these suffering people. For example, the garbage picked up every day is sold by them, and if new refugees move into the open space, they have to pay their respects to them first. There are many bad situations, too numerous to mention. If we want to do a good job in relief work, we must first completely eradicate this special class of "refugee emperors"!

### A Singer's Confession

— Cheng Juntao

Spiritual solace can enable a singer to overcome material and physiological difficulties. This is the valuable experience that opera star Lily Pons has gained in recent years.

"Don't sing too much" has always been a golden rule for singers. For many years, Lily Pons strictly adhered to it. Because, according to the experience of past music and medical experts, singing too much can make a person feel tired and lose the power to control breathing and pronunciation, resulting in the inability to sing beautiful sounds. However, Lily Pons made a new discovery while performing concerts for the troops during World War II. She felt that as long as she had spiritual comfort, it didn't matter if she sang a little more.

Normally, Lily Pons stipulates that she should only perform a maximum of four times a week, but during wartime travel concerts for the troops, she averaged two performances a day. The singing locations were on the front lines in Persia, Africa, Italy, India, Burma, China, France, Belgium, and Germany. After dizzying high-altitude flights, sitting in bumpy, hard jeeps, and eating simple food, Lily Pons' voice was not affected.

"I have never sung so well in my life!" Lily Pons said during her tour. After careful study, she felt that this was not accidental. She discovered that when she sang, the reaction she received was unparalleled spiritual solace, which invisibly overcame material and physiological difficulties, and even increased the effectiveness of her singing. She had the following record:

"The most important reaction from traveling to perform for the troops is that magical spiritual comfort. Singing in front of those brave children, shaking hands with them, talking to them, that kind of happiness is beyond description. When I feel that my singing can give them some comfort, I feel so happy! This kind of feeling really gives people great power. At that time, you won't think about personal comfort, and you won't have time to feel tired. If some of the difficulties encountered in these tour concerts for the troops occurred during a regular professional concert tour, it would be a fatal blow to a general singer - I think they would not be able to withstand it."

From her work with the troops, Lily Pons gained a new perspective on life. This perspective has helped her singing. She felt that if an artist could do their best to give the public spiritual comfort, they would surely achieve great success.

Many people think that music is not easy to appreciate, but according to Lily Pons' experience, many soldiers originally did not have much knowledge of music, but she felt that people have an innate ability to appreciate things that are "true, good, and beautiful." Bach-Gounod's "Ave Maria" is one of the programs that Lily Pons must include in every concert, and it is also one of the most popular programs.

Lily Pons said that the whole world now needs the comfort of "true, good, and beautiful" music, and even more needs artists who are willing to serve the public!

### Movies Fifty Years Ago

— Chai Fei

Movies originated in 1896. By 1903, starting from a small-scale operation similar to a peep show, it gradually had its business foundation, its own technology, and its own audience.

The world's earliest movie was shown on April 23, 1896, at Koster & Bial's Music Hall in New York, USA. This music hall is the former site of the Chase Company. On that day, The New York Times reported on this world's earliest movie as follows: "Last night, the lights in the music hall were completely turned off. In the dim corner building, there was a lot of noise and excitement. Soon, a strange ray of light shone directly on a white curtain. Then everyone saw two young actors from the amusement park, dressed in red and blue costumes, quickly dancing a parachute dance. Their movements can be said to be vividly portrayed. When they disappeared, everyone saw a surge of waves crashing against the stone embankment on the beach, and everyone was taken aback... After a short while, a thin and long clown and a short and fat clown performed a funny boxing match, followed by an allegorical comedy called "Monroe Doctrine", and a fragment taken from Hoyt's comedy "A Milk White Flag" was repeated many times. Finally, a tall girl performed a skirt dance. All these shadow plays were performed very realistically and won enthusiastic applause from the audience."

The surprise evoked by this new invention was obviously very widespread, and people simply regarded it as a magical thing. The lifelike parachute dance was stunning, the terrifying waves made everyone break out in a cold sweat, the reproduction of the song and dance comedy made people excited, and everyone was satisfied with the skirt dance. According to Dickson, an assistant to the inventor Edison: "This is a new invention of magical illusion. The magic of the nineteenth century has reached its peak."

### Japanese Military Police and Puppet Police

— Ling Xiaohan Pavilion

Our country has repeatedly reported sending dozens of military police officers to Japan. It is said that the number of people and expenses need to be considered and negotiated with the Allied countries. This matter will definitely be realized. People in the old capital believe that the sooner the better, and the number of people is a secondary issue. Even if one or two people are sent to Tokyo to show off their power, it can slightly relieve the accumulated anger of the past eight years. The reason is that when the Japanese military police were stationed in China, the Chinese compatriots were subjected to anger and abuse, and the impression was worse than any other Japanese arrogance.

The Japanese "soldiers" and "officials" certainly have different names, such as the so-called "Dispatch Army Headquarters," the so-called "Asia Development Board Liaison Department," and the so-called "Ministers" and "Consuls," each with its own arrogance. However, those who come into contact with them are senior officials of the puppet committee, and there are some formalities and procedures, and they are still relatively far from the lives of the people. However, the military police are rampant and unruly, without any boundaries, deceiving everyone, and interfering in everything. They often break into people's homes to capture and torture them, and the citizens are so scared that they become a "terrorist object" in the city.

If Japanese military and political officials want to do anything, they often inform the puppet committee to carry it out in the name of Chinese officials. However, the Japanese military police disregard everything and issue announcements under the title of "Military Police Corps." For example, the distribution of food has nothing to do with their authority, but they also post announcements. Not only are the puppet officials embarrassed, but even the Japanese commanders and officers are not in the eyes of the Japanese military police. Puppet ministers and puppet governors were also sometimes summoned by the Japanese military police. Only changing "summon" to "invite" was considered particularly polite. For example, Wang Shijing was often one of the people who was "invited."

The Overseas Chinese Political Committee also has a military police force, but it has no power and is just a figurehead. Occasionally, there are routine inspections, etc. The puppet newspaper records must add the words "Chinese" to it, otherwise people will mistakenly think it is a Japanese team. Because when "military police" is mentioned, everyone knows that it is Japanese. At the time, it was said that the "supreme government" of the puppet association was not in the Japanese military headquarters, but in the Japanese military police. This is the truth, and it is also a joke!

In addition, another "terrorist object" is the enemy's puppet "traffic police." The enemy used its "South Manchuria Railway Company" to control the railways in North China, calling it the "North China Transportation Company," and separately formed its police force, the "North China Transportation Police," who specialized in searching passengers at various stations and on trains, arbitrarily beating and scolding them without any reason. Their female puppet police officers teased and ridiculed the beautiful male actors, while the Japanese soldiers sneered from the side. Even senior officials of the puppet government and their families, unless they were taken care of by the Japanese chiefs, could hardly avoid being insulted by the puppet traffic police, in order to show that they were not under the jurisdiction of Chinese officials, which could be boasted about.

### On Painting Inscriptions

— Wang Baili

Inscription poems on paintings should be concise and relevant. Just like calligraphy emphasizes "vitality and rhythm," painting originally requires deep meaning and simple language. So-called deep and obvious expression is interesting. If the language and meaning are equally deep, it's not "top-notch," let alone if the meaning is shallow and the language is deep. It is said that the old doggerel poems in our country were created by oil workers. Because the language was vulgar, it was called the "doggerel style," and people looked down on it. In fact, this is forgetting one's roots. Try looking at the part of the Book of Songs that describes Chinese customs. Isn't it just the folk songs of the alleys? Qing Zhou Liyuan first inscribed on a white-headed bird standing on a peach blossom tree: "Peach blossoms are already three thousand years old, and the blue bird flies here with a white head." Because the white-headed bird was difficult to depict, he thought of the long age of the peach tree to set off the reason for the bird's white head. The meaning is so profound, but even a first-grade elementary school student can recognize these dozen words. Can you say it's not a good poem? Another person painted a monkey sleeping on a withered vine and inscribed it: "The monkey should wake up now, don't wait for the vine to wither and the tree to fall." It is truly thought-provoking. Someone else inscribed on a photo of a prostitute surnamed Hua: "So captivating, her surname must be Hua." These seven characters are also extremely vivid. Unfortunately, I don't have the painting on hand, so I can't give the name in detail.) Another example is Wu Wei of the Ming Dynasty, who inscribed a painting: "An old man with white hair, riding a buffalo to drink water; hooves stepping on hooves on the bank, mouths facing mouths in the water." It is truly a realistic scene and can be called a masterpiece. Another anonymous person inscribed on a painting of a beggar: "I beg for my food, what does it have to do with you; born with a snobbish dog's nature, only biting torn clothes!" It portrays the snobbish situation of society in detail. Reading it evokes endless emotions. As for Feng Haisu of the Yuan Dynasty, he inscribed a small song on a painting of Yang Guifei suffering from toothache: "Qinghua Palace, a tooth aches, Mawei Slope, the whole body aches, the drums of Yuyang shake the earth, the world aches!" These few words are extremely straightforward!

### Wandering Flower

— Chen Shengyan

Chapter Six: Such a Wonderful Night (35)

Zhu looked at the clothes in the cabinet, and then pressed his hand on the suitcase, and smiled: "Don't worry, let me try it for you." Then he took out all the clothes in the suitcase, re-folded them one by one, very carefully, evenly and steadily, put them in the box one by one, and put them in a very orderly manner. Qihuan helped him take the clothes at first, but later, when she saw Zhu Zhai refolding the clothes she had already folded, and had to fit the size of the box, she laughed: "Zhu, you work like a woman, extremely meticulous, I am an impatient person, not as good as you!" Saying that, she put her hands on her waist and stood still, watching Zhu Zhai pack up. Zhu Zhai was not afraid of trouble, and in an orderly manner, he packed all the clothes in the box, then pressed hard and fastened the box, and said to Qi Huan with a smile: "How is it? I have put them all in!" Qi Huan was so happy that she leaned up to Zhu Zhai, tightly grasped his hand, shook it several times and said: "Thank you! Thank you! I really didn't expect that you, who were so brave at Shichahai last time, are so meticulous in packing things today. You must be tired, and it's not early, please take a rest!" Saying that, she took Zhu Zhai's hand and went to the outer room together, seeing that Wang Ma had already set up a small bed against the wall, with the quilt and blanket all neatly laid out. Qi Huan pointed to the small bed and said: "I'm sorry, just rest on this bed for a while, and it will be dawn." Zhu Zhai said: "Why bother! I can just sit for a while." Qi Huan said: "That won't do, you should lie down and close your eyes to refresh yourself." Seeing her repeatedly urging him, Zhu Zhai had no choice but to take off his suit jacket and lie down on the small bed. Qi Huan personally covered him with the quilt and blanket, tucking it in tightly on both sides, before raising her hand and saying "See you tomorrow!" With a sweet smile, she turned around and naturally walked into the bedroom. Zhu Zhai's emotions, after being stirred by her, his heart was still throbbing, and he couldn't fall asleep. Closing his eyes, Qi Huan's beautiful smiling face appeared before him, and he only heard the whistling wind outside, shaking the windows and rustling. Lying on the bed, tossing and turning, he just couldn't fall asleep. Thinking of Qi Huan's tender feelings and honey-like affection, which made people drunk, such a lovely girl, she was leaving tomorrow, and a feeling of reluctance arose in his heart, and he couldn't help but sigh slightly. Immediately, he heard Qi Huan asking in the bedroom: "Zhu, are you still not asleep?" Zhu Zhai smiled and said: "Yes, I can't sleep, how about you?" Qi Huan said: "I can't sleep either, the wind is very strong outside, and I feel particularly sad when I hear the wind." Zhu Zhai replied: "Isn't that right? I feel the same way!" Qi Huan said: "It's already five o'clock now, and it will be dawn in another hour. Since you can't sleep, why don't you come in and talk?" As soon as Zhu Zhai heard this, he turned over and sat up, and without even putting on his coat, he hurried into the bedroom, only to see Qi Huan wrapped in a brocade quilt, smiling slightly. He couldn't help but feel dazed! Suddenly hearing Jiang Huan say: "I am a person who is very proud and cares a lot about my face." These two sentences were like a morning bell, immediately awakening him from his infatuation. He thought to himself that I respect her, my love for her is pure, the noblest love, how can I turn to intimacy! I am a married man, how can I do this! In that instant, only this thought flashed through his mind, and he stopped, and smiled at Qi Huan: "I'm sorry!"

### In the Midst of Solicitation

— Ping Zhai

At the end of last year, my wife and I went to the state-owned goods company to buy things. As soon as we walked up the stairs, several young middle school students stopped us and asked us to donate some money to the poor refugees to make winter clothes with a smile. They all wore rectangular credentials on their clothes, hung school badges, and were very sincere in their attitude. Of course, I was very happy to donate some money, and they quickly filled out a receipt for me on the goods counter of the state-owned goods company. At that time, I couldn't help but have a feeling of gratitude and love for them.

During the New Year's Day holiday, I took my child to the park. I was helping him take steps on the grass when I suddenly looked up and saw three young people standing in front of me, two men and one woman, who said to me: "We are students from ×× University. Because the tuition fee for the next semester is too expensive, many students are in danger of dropping out of school. Therefore, we have launched a fundraising campaign. Please help us a little." I took out some money, and they thanked me repeatedly, giving me a well-printed rectangular card with the number and amount printed on it—it was as if it was still missing the stamp of a responsible fundraising organization.

The day before yesterday at noon, I came out of the office and went to a Cantonese restaurant for lunch. As soon as I ordered the food, a young man who looked like a student came, holding a large stack of books, about twenty or thirty books, walked up to me, put the books on the table, and said: "I am a student from ×× University. Because the tuition fee for the next semester is too expensive, I have trafficked some books, please buy a few." I really wanted to buy one or two of them, but when I looked at the books, I was stunned—they were all "Star Song Selections," "Chinese and Western Movie Songs," and a few very "yellow" novels. Only one copy of "A Tale of Two Cities" was barely satisfactory, but my heart felt a little cold. Perhaps I hesitated for too long, and the young man said coldly, "I'm sorry," and had already turned to another table.

Just now, I wanted to go to the movies. The director of that movie was an old friend of mine for more than ten years, so when I saw the "Sold Out" sign in front of the theater, although I felt regret that I couldn't get in, I was also happy for my old friend, and I stood there looking at the stills in the window. Unexpectedly, at this moment, another neatly dressed young man walked up to me, smiling and whispering that he had tickets. The price he quoted was more than half the price of the ticket, and he explained: "There's no way, the tuition fee for the next semester is too high, so..."

However, I only felt infinite disappointment, and I really had no mood to watch the movie anymore.

### Manila Musings

It is often reported that Manila is devastated by hurricanes, and it has become an important headline in the news. Therefore, I have gathered some trivial matters about the city to fill in the blanks for this publication.

Manila is a city in the Philippines that was developed very early. As early as 1570, it had already come into contact with the Spanish. The local natives spread the rumor that these foreigners were monsters who ate pebbles, swallowed fire, and had tails, so they were initially very afraid of them. Later, when Chinese, Dutch, British, and Americans arrived there one after another, they became accustomed to it. It is said that Filipinos like Americans the most, not because Americans treat them particularly well, but because Americans introduced Coca-Cola.

In the early 16th century, Spaniards who migrated to Manila already had trade relations with our country. The goods brought by our merchants included silk and porcelain, etc. Manila's export goods mainly included shark fins, seafood, etc.

The language of Manila is very complex, divided into eight major categories, with more than eighty kinds in total. Every Manileño must be a natural linguist, otherwise it is not enough to cope with daily communication. There is also a strange disease there, locally called "Mali mali," in which the patient imitates the other person's slang and actions when he or she meets anyone, and cannot control it.

The women of Manila are very capable. About half of the dentists in the city are women. The general manager of a large-scale Manila inland airline before the war was also a female entrepreneur.

Saint Thomas is the oldest university there, established earlier than Harvard University in the United States.

### This Newspaper's Winter Clothing Drive Ends Concentration of Efforts to Raise Scholarship Funds

This newspaper's "Winter Clothing Drive," which was sponsored by one organization, started on December 21st of last year and lasted for ten days. It has already expired. During the fundraising period, thanks to the enthusiastic support of readers, whether donating large sums of money or donating winter clothes, this campaign has achieved satisfactory results. This newspaper will complete the sorting out in the next few days and then hand over these winter clothes and donations to the city's winter relief association for distribution to various charities. The fundraising has now stopped, and donations and winter clothes will no longer be accepted, in order to fully prepare for the scholarship campaign that will begin soon. We are afraid that this has not been fully informed, so we hereby announce it.

To Mr. Zhang Xizhen: If this woman is already someone's fiancée, she cannot enter into another engagement with you before the engagement is dissolved. It is said that this man's behavior is improper and that he has recently been imprisoned. If it is a sentence of imprisonment, the woman may file for dissolution of the engagement in accordance with Article 976, Item 8 of the Civil Code. The woman is twenty years old, and must be twenty years old to be considered an adult. To enter into an engagement as a minor requires the consent of a legal guardian (parents). If you and this woman wish to marry, Mr. Someone will naturally not be able to interfere if legal procedures are followed.
