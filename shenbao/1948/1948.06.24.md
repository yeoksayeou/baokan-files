Secretary-General Li Weiguo urged him to stay, but to no avail. In the evening, Weng hosted a banquet at his official residence to persuade him. According to reporters, Xu's reason for firmly resigning from his concurrent position was that the number of times the cost of living for civil servants and teachers this month, as proposed by Xu, was 530,000 times in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, but it was later revised by Weng to 420,000 times, which was dissatisfied by some people afterwards.

A plan has been drafted before the trip, and after consultation with various parties in Beiping and Tianjin, it will be implemented immediately after returning to Shanghai. There are three measures: (1) To relax the standards for remittance and allow cash transportation, the limit of which is about one-quarter of the idle capital flowing south. Li estimated that about 400 billion yuan flows to Shanghai every day. (2) To transport a large amount of grain, cloth, and sugar to the north for sale based on the needs of the north. Some have already been shipped. (3) To issue short-term treasury bills, using high interest rates close to the black market to absorb idle capital. 10 trillion has been sold in Tianjin. The flow of idle capital from the Northeast into the pass will be dispersed as much as possible to avoid causing trouble exclusively in Beiping and Tianjin.

Commentary

### On Rumored Currency Reform

— Zai Shiyun

At the beginning of the victory, the average price level in Kunming and Chongqing was about six thousand times that before the war. When the news of Japan's surrender came, the social psychology changed drastically. Prices in the rear once dropped to three thousand times the pre-war level within a short period; the legal tender, which had continued to depreciate for eight years, actually had a brief moment of appreciation, increasing in value by 50%. This could be considered an important embellishment to the victory of the War of Resistance. Subsequently, the internal turmoil continued and gradually expanded. Tax revenues declined, military expenditures increased day by day, and the phenomenon of currency inflation intensified, with prices rising even more sharply. Counting the time until now, it has only been two years and ten months, less than three years. The wholesale price index in Beijing has already reached more than one million times that before the war. Although the multiple increase in prices in other cities like Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou is slightly lower than in Beijing, the difference is actually limited. Based on this, prices have increased three hundredfold in less than three years, a rate that is alarming. The devaluation of the legal tender has had a very negative impact on the economy and society. Therefore, in order to show a new style, the government has recently indirectly announced that it will reform the currency system.

The rumored plan for currency reform is quite specific at present. The government spokesperson has not explicitly denied it, and has at least publicly stated that the plan to reform the currency system is imperative, with only the implementation date yet to be determined. The content of the currency reform plan generally includes the following points: (1) Restoring the silver standard internally; (2) Adopting a managed gold standard externally; (3) The silver coin unit weighing 0.42 taels (Treasury Standard), with one US dollar equivalent to five silver coins, and each silver coin equivalent to 200,000 legal tender; (4) Planning to recall the legal tender currently in circulation within four months after implementation. A rumored currency reform is so specific, which makes us believe that this is at least a blueprint for a plan that is being brewed. We should discuss it.

First, allow us to explain the statutory ratio problem in the rumored plan. If one US dollar is equivalent to five silver coins, this is a provision for linking the domestic currency with the US dollar under the managed gold standard. In theory, the managed gold standard should stipulate a nominal standard with a certain gold content as a unit for international trade calculation. However, the actual gold-silver ratio fluctuates from time to time. This is because the relative demand for silver has decreased, and the price of silver has gradually fallen in the past. Therefore, the conversion rate of one US dollar to five silver coins cannot be maintained. As for the provision of one silver coin equivalent to 200,000 legal tender, it is even more inappropriate. Even based on June's prices, which are considered to be one million times the pre-war level, one million legal tender is roughly equivalent to the purchasing power of one pre-war yuan. Currently, on the black market, pre-war silver dollars (weighing 0.72 taels Treasury Standard) sell for about 750,000 legal tender. If calculated according to the price level, a silver coin weighing 0.42 taels Treasury Standard should be equivalent to about 580,000 legal tender. If calculated according to the current price of pre-war silver dollars, a silver coin should be equivalent to 420,000 to 430,000 legal tender. Therefore, the provision of one silver coin equivalent to 200,000 legal tender can be seen as either suppressing prices or suppressing the value of silver coins. In fact, most merchants or producers do not have a specific concept of the price of silver, and they may convert prices into the number of silver coins based on the ratio of 200,000 to one, which would result in raising prices. From the above two aspects, it is hoped that this is just a rumor; otherwise, this prescribed ratio is very problematic.

Secondly, let's discuss the rumored currency reform plan. The method of "adopting the silver standard internally and the managed gold standard externally" is actually the managed gold standard currency reform plan proposed by Kemmerer for China before the war. However, the silver coins in Kemmerer's plan are not the standard currency, but only a representative currency or silver subsidiary currency; the actual value of the representative currency is not equal to its face value, and the face value is higher than the actual value. Kemmerer did this in order to avoid the situation where silver coins were collected and melted by the people when the price of silver was high, resulting in a shortage of currency. The currency system rumored to be implemented soon adopts the silver standard internally, stipulates the Treasury Standard weight of the silver coin unit; and because of its connection with the US dollar, the face value of the silver coin is consistent with its actual value. The important difference between this and Kemmerer's plan lies in the domestic price calculation unit: if silver coins only occupy the position of subsidiary currency, then the calculation unit is still based on the managed gold standard unit; if silver coins are the standard, then all calculations are based on silver coins, and the managed gold standard is just a unit for international trade. The latter is equivalent to using both gold and silver currencies, which belongs to the bimetallic standard in the monetary system. The disadvantages of the bimetallic standard are very obvious. The main key lies in the fluctuation of the price of silver. In other words, the instability of the world silver market will affect the instability of our currency system. Whether the price of silver decreases or increases, it will have an adverse effect on the country. Of course, the cheapening of silver can increase export trade; the more expensive the silver, the greater the purchasing power abroad. The advantages and disadvantages seem not to be generalized. In fact, in terms of the nature of currency, value must be stable; the stability of currency value is also the relative stability of prices. Therefore, in addition to the managed gold standard, it is not appropriate to adopt the silver standard domestically. In principle, it is better to adopt a simple managed gold standard, and silver coins should only occupy the position of representative or subsidiary currency. In addition, there is another point related to this issue, which is the difference between the managed gold standard and the foreign exchange standard. Strictly speaking, the rumored currency system belongs to the foreign exchange standard rather than the managed gold standard. Because, although the managed gold standard does not necessarily require the minting of gold coins for circulation, it must stipulate a nominal standard containing a certain amount of gold; the foreign exchange parity is determined by comparing this gold content with the gold content of a certain country's currency system. Nowadays, the domestic silver standard currency is directly linked to the US dollar. In the future, the fluctuation of the US dollar value will directly affect domestic prices, which will add an unstable factor to the currency system. Therefore, in principle, the standard of the rumored currency system is also problematic.

Finally, we want to talk about the conditions for reform. In the current situation, the problem in this aspect is more important than the previous two. As discussed in the first paragraph, prices in my country have increased 300 times in less than three years, and the currency value has depreciated so much. The basic reason is that the government's financial revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, and printing banknotes is used to replace financial revenue; the latter is due to the continuous expansion of the civil war, the disruption of transportation, and social unrest. If these two basic factors cannot be eliminated, currency reform is meaningless. The currency system we are currently using is not a bad system, but the government's improper use of it. In particular, the mistake is that the fiscal policy and the monetary system are not distinguished, and the currency that is related to the country's public and private economic activities is regarded as a fiscal tool. Prices were relatively stable two or three years before the war, which is enough to show that the recent price problem is not the fault of the monetary system. In the future, if the war does not stop, it will be difficult to improve production and transportation, and materials will inevitably be scarce; if the government's financial revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, and expenditure still exceeds revenue by a large amount, even if the currency system is changed and a large number of silver coins are minted and used, the price problem will still exist. People certainly have confidence in silver coins with real value, but, precisely because of this, people will inevitably hoard them as much as possible. At the same time, the government's financial revenue and expenditure cannot be offset, and the amount of silver is limited. The government will inevitably issue convertible notes. As a result, the trend of hoarding silver coins will expand, and the actual value of the convertible notes will inevitably decrease. After twists and turns, the government will eventually be forced to abandon the silver standard, currency will continue to inflate, and price increases will be repeated. Therefore, if the conditions for currency reform are not sufficient, currency reform will be in vain.

In short, in order to save my country's economic crisis, the currency system must be reformed. However, in reality, it may not be possible at present. The most important thing is to first have the conditions for reforming the currency system, and at the same time, study a currency system that is in line with national conditions and is targeted at the international environment.

### Strange or Not Strange; A Five-Year-Old Boy He Chunzu "Gives Birth" to a "Love Child"; Surgery Performed at Nanjing Central Hospital

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] A five-year-old boy had a caesarean section at the Central Hospital in Nanjing on the 23rd, two years after becoming "pregnant", to remove a 5-inch-long male infant, becoming a world-shaking wonder. However, when the reporter interviewed Dr. Wu Zaidong, director of the Examination Department of the Central Hospital, on the 23rd, Wu explained that the factors for the boy's pregnancy should include the following three points: (1) After conception, cell division and development, sometimes a part of the cells suddenly remain in the body of another developing fetus, which makes the retained cells grow in the body at any time after the fetus is born and grows up, and become deformed. (2) If several organic cells remain in the abdomen of another fetus within one month of conception, they will become a monster after biochemical changes. (3) Twins, but after division, one becomes a formed infant, and the other becomes a parasitic fetus in the body, which may cause two feet to grow on the two arms, or a tumor to grow on the two hands, all of which are abnormally developed twins. The boy in the Central Hospital today may belong to the second category. Wu instructed the reporter to visit the boy's "love child" during the explanation. At first, only a fleshy ball was seen. The reporter thought it was strange. Then, Dr. Wu turned it over and immediately saw the objects hidden in the foreskin, with two feet, toes, a very small number of hairs, and teeth. Two intestines also grew, but hair only grew on a small piece of meat, and there was no shape of head, face, or body. In the eyes of people outside the medical field, it is not enough to recognize the shape of the fetus. The strange cell relies on the blood of the five-year-old boy to absorb nutrients. The boy is from Wujin County, Jiangsu Province, named He Chunzu. The boy discovered a hard mass in his abdomen when he was two years old, and it has been three years. The reporter specially visited this "postpartum male mind" on the 23rd. His face was yellow and black, his eyes were big and dull, and he was afraid when he saw strangers coming and being photographed. The abdomen is being bandaged. His mother is a young woman in her thirties, taking care of him by the bed. The boy has recovered to a normal state and will not affect his growth and development.

### The Min River is Flooded and Devastated; More Than Thirty Cities Suffered a Catastrophe; The Disaster Situation in the Jiulong River Basin is Also Extremely Tragic

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 23rd] The entire province of Fujian has recently suffered severe flooding. According to the brief reports received from various counties in the past few days, more than 40 counties have been affected, which is the most seen in a century. Nearly 30 cities in the Min River basin have been affected, and at least 10 in the Jiulong River basin have suffered the same severe disaster. Houses everywhere have been reduced to ruins, people and animals have died, and fields have been flooded. The magnitude of the loss will be astronomical and cannot be estimated at present. In addition to Fuzhou, the counties that have reported disasters to the province and requested assistance include Yong'an, Shaxian, Lianjiang, Minqing, Gutian, Changtai, and Linsen. Jingshan, Fenggang, Shuanghu, and Xiaonan townships in Linsen County suffered the most severe losses, with 80% of the early rice harvest lost and 50% of the late rice harvest lost. The dikes along the river in Tongyu and Jiufeng townships were completely washed away, and the water submerged the roofs, and livestock were also extinct. The flood in Lianjiang County reached three feet high on the evening of the 18th, and all fields and houses were washed away. The flood in Yong'an entered the city on the 17th, and the entire city became a swamp. The severity of the damage in Shaxian has not been seen in 70 years. The disaster situation in Gutian and Minqing is the same. At present, land and water postal and telecommunications traffic is blocked, and no county has a detailed disaster report sent to the province.

### Will Japan Become the Arsenal of the Far East?

— Wu Jiatang

Wu Jiatang, the director of this newspaper's interview room, recently returned from a trip to Japan. He presents his observations and experiences, with the first installment already published in this newspaper's special commentary yesterday. Starting today, the second part will be serialized on page two. Mr. Wu's trip was brief, and his findings are limited. He only expresses his personal impressions and feelings. However, his objective reporting may assist those concerned about the political situation in Japan. We hope readers will pay attention. (Editor)

The argument that the United States is supporting Japan to become the arsenal of the Far East has been widely circulated. However, after the reporter personally went to Japan for investigation, he deeply felt that this view cannot be established based on very basic military common sense. Because if the United States has this intention, its only hypothetical enemy must be the Soviet Union. However, once a war breaks out, Japan is on the front line. The Soviet Union can arbitrarily use its powerful aerial power to destroy the arsenal established by the United States in Japan at any time. Therefore, the United States will never be stupid enough to not even think of this point, and will put the arsenal and wartime production mechanism on the front line. From this, we can understand that this statement is just a deceptive talk, or it has other hidden meanings.

The argument of developing Japan into the arsenal of the Far East is just a clever propaganda with a definite goal. They hope that the Allied Headquarters will be pressured by world opinion, so that it cannot change Japan's production level to the minimum level of self-sufficiency. Furthermore, their conspiracy is to accelerate the collapse of Japan's entire economy. If this can be realized, the Japanese Communist forces will take the opportunity to infiltrate and make Japan completely communist. In fact, this is the Soviet Union's basic plan for the world, in China, Czechoslovakia, and Japan, it is the same. This point must be considered when calmly studying the Japanese issue.

The Allied Headquarters' reconstruction of Japan's economic order is the only way to prevent the communist redification of Japan. We can prove the correctness of its path based on facts. Today, Japan has lost its overseas colonies, and the source of raw materials and the market have also been lost. The population scattered in various places before the war is concentrated on the three islands of the mainland, and the population has become a serious problem for Japan. According to the statistics from October 1, 1945 to February 29, 1948, the population of Japan increased by 7.1 million. Therefore, the Japanese government must, under the guidance of the Allied Headquarters, try to solve the food problem of these more than 7 million people. Japan's food production in 1947 was 13 million tons, and now it must increase by 2 million tons to maintain the minimum food level of the people. At the current rate of population increase in Japan, the rate of food production increase is destined to not keep up with the rate of population increase. Therefore, these 2 million tons of food must be purchased from overseas with foreign exchange. Currently, this batch of food is being supplied by the United States in kind or in funds, and Japan owes the United States 400 million US dollars every year. Not only that, Japan today is also experiencing high prices, and the actual income of the people is decreasing day by day. Taking the price of rice as an example, in February of last year, the black market price of rice in Tokyo was 40.27 yen per kilogram, and by February of this year, it had risen to 130.49 yen per kilogram. The situation is equally serious in the general price level. The price index in March of last year was 137.1, and it rose to 310.6 in March of this year, an increase of more than double.

Under this severe economic situation, if we do not try to improve the general level of production, it is likely to cause social and political disturbances. With the support of the Third International forces, it will eventually cause the arrival of a storm.

When I was in Japan, I compared and studied their industrial production level. The production level in Japan in March of this year was 49% of the pre-war standard. The so-called "pre-war standard" refers to the average figure between 1930 and 1934. The war period after 1937 is not included. 1941 was the peak of Japan's productivity, which was 210.5% of the "pre-war level." Last year's production figure was 40.9%, and it took a year of effort to increase by 9% to reach the 49% level. In March of this year, Japan's textile production was only 21.7% of the pre-war production. The production of cotton yarn in March was 21.4% of the pre-war level. The output of silk in the same month was 16.9% of the pre-war level. The output of cotton fabrics in March was only 26.7% of the pre-war level, and the production figure of rayon fabrics was only 19.4% of the pre-war level. In the metal industry sector, the output in March of this year was 50% of the pre-war level. The output of pig iron in March was only 42.9% of the pre-war level of 1930-1934, while the production level on the eve of the Pearl Harbor Incident reached 338.3%, and it also reached 184.7% during the Lugouqiao Incident. The output of refined steel in March of this year was 48.9% of the pre-war level, while it reached 287.3% at the peak in 1943, and it also reached 213.1% in 1937. In fact, if calculated in tons, Japan's current steel production is still far below the limit of the Far Eastern Commission. Japan's current annual steel ingot production is 1.5 million tons, and the maximum limit of the Far Eastern Commission is 3.5 million tons. In the chemical industry sector, the production index in March of this year was 60.3% of the pre-war level; if calculated in tons, it is also far below the limit of the Far Eastern Commission. For example, this year's sulfuric acid production in Japan is estimated to reach 1.94 million tons, while the limit of the Far Eastern Commission is 3.5 million tons. This year's caustic soda production is estimated to reach 96,000 tons, but the limit of the Far Eastern Commission is as high as 630,000 tons. This comparison of figures should be able to best explain the truth of Japan's industrial level today. As for the accuracy of these numbers, a member of the Chinese delegation to Japan told me: they are generally reliable. These figures can show that Japan's industrial production level is still far from the day of self-sufficiency, and in terms of the current progress, there is no question of constituting a threat. I think the Allied Headquarters' expectation of raising Japan's industry to the standard of self-sufficiency in 1953 is too optimistic. Even if we do our best, I am afraid that the possibility of achieving the goal is very small.

I believe that if the regions that supply Japan with raw materials and markets are trapped in economic chaos and depression for a long time, Japan's industry and the entire economy cannot achieve the goal of stability alone, and may even decline as a result. Even with the efforts of the Allied Headquarters and the Japanese themselves, the progress of the economic situation will be slow and difficult. If US aid is suddenly stopped, leaving a vacuum that China and other Far Eastern committees cannot fill, the situation will inevitably deteriorate. The Soviet Union sees this most clearly. They also know that the Allied Headquarters has no intention of turning Japan into an arsenal. If there were any facts, the Soviet representative would have opened fire at the Far Eastern Committee long ago, but she has not made any statement so far.

As for the Strake-Jones report, it is even more difficult to compare with this. What must be recognized is that these two reviews are "individual reports and do not necessarily constitute the policy of the Far Eastern Commission." Even in the United States, Marshall, MacArthur, and senior officials of the Allied Headquarters may not all agree with the recommendations of the two reports. My statement is not an ivory tower, and there is indeed a factual basis, but it has not yet reached the stage of publication.

It is understandable that the United States sent experts to Japan for field investigation to rationalize the policy of occupying Japan, and its motive is to solve the problem. In a democratic way, this investigation report will inevitably be made public to the member states of the Far Eastern Commission. If these so-called reports and review texts are misinterpreted and attacked once they are published, it is tantamount to encouraging opaque and one-sided actions.

### Soviet Union Openly Challenges Western Allies East Germany Implements New Monetary System Announces that Greater Berlin is also Included Four-Power Experts Meeting Ends Late at Night Without Results

[This newspaper] London, 23rd broadcast: Berlin news, today, Britain, the United States, France and the Soviet Union launched a fierce cold war in Berlin. After the Soviet Union announced the reform of the monetary system in East Germany, the three Western countries decided to issue new Deutsche Marks in their occupied areas in West Berlin. This situation will allow two different currencies to circulate in Berlin at the same time.

[Reuters Berlin, 23rd] The Soviet authorities announced: The reform of the monetary system in the Soviet occupation zone and Greater Berlin will be implemented on the 24th. At the same time, they notified the Western occupying powers that they have no administrative, economic or political reasons to stay in Berlin. They must accept the monetary system of the Soviet occupation zone, or they will be subject to economic or administrative sanctions. Sokolovsky's order that the four districts of Berlin must accept the reform of the monetary system in East Germany at the same time is tantamount to a direct challenge to the heads of government of the three Western powers. The heads of the three powers had individually sent letters to Sokolovsky on Monday, stating their firm refusal to recognize Greater Berlin as part of the Soviet zone, or that Greater Berlin must be bound by any unilateral orders from the Soviet side. In this situation, the most embarrassed will be the Berlin municipal government. Sokolovsky has ordered the Berlin municipal government to implement the Soviet price bureau's monetary system reform order throughout the city. However, the heads of the three Western military governments have also notified the Berlin municipal government, instructing it not to comply with the orders of the Soviet authorities, and to implement the Soviet authorities' monetary system reform order in the three British, American and French districts. Sokolovsky's letter to the three Western chiefs stated that due to the monetary system reform implemented by the Western powers in their occupied areas last weekend, the unity of Germany was destroyed. Therefore, the Soviet authorities have also decided to implement the monetary system reform in the entire Soviet area and Greater Berlin. I hope that you will not obstruct the implementation of this monetary system reform in your jurisdiction in Berlin.

Before the Soviet authorities implemented the monetary system reform, the four powers experts met on the afternoon of the 22nd to discuss the possibility of implementing the four-power-based monetary system reform in Berlin. The negotiations ended late last night without results. Colonel-General Lukan Zhinei, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Military Government, then sent a letter to the Acting Mayor of Berlin this morning, stating that the marked Deutsche Marks will be in general use from June 24. From the 26th, old Deutsche Marks without stamps and Deutsche Marks issued by the Allied military government will be prohibited from circulation in the Soviet area and Greater Berlin. Sokolovsky separately sent letters to the British, American and French military government chiefs, saying that the announcement by the British, American and French occupying authorities to implement a separate monetary system reform in West Germany has put the Soviet occupation zone in a difficult position. I have to take measures to protect the interests of the people, the Soviet occupation zone and the economy of Berlin, and prevent the chaos caused by the influx of old currencies from West Germany into the Soviet area. Therefore, I have decided to implement the monetary system reform in the Soviet area and Greater Berlin. I hope that you will not obstruct the implementation of this monetary system reform in your jurisdiction in Berlin.

### US, Britain and France Form a Strong Front to Jointly Resist Soviet Pressure The New Currency of East Germany Shall Not Circulate in West Berlin

[Reuters Berlin, 23rd] After an emergency meeting at the Robertson headquarters this morning, the heads of the three British, American and French occupation zones decided to reject the Soviet decision to implement the monetary system reform in the Western Allied occupation zones of Berlin tomorrow. Generals Robertson, Clay and Koenig decided to form the strongest possible front to resist Soviet pressure. The three generals solemnly announced that the monetary system reform announced by the Soviet authorities is completely invalid for the British, American and French occupation zones of Berlin.

The authorities of the three districts have ordered all banks and shops in the districts, except for shops selling food and medicine, to close down from the 24th until further notice. The announcement of the three districts also stated that the old Deutsche Marks currently circulating in the three districts will continue to be valid, and all prices will continue to remain unchanged. The German Marks of West Germany will circulate in West Berlin. The prices in the West Berlin area will be temporarily suspended until further notice. Until further orders, the import of currency circulating in East Germany into West Berlin will be regarded as illegal, and those who violate this order will be severely punished. Detailed information on the exchange of new Deutsche Marks will be announced soon. This order was jointly signed by the three commanders-in-chief and broadcast by the radio station in the US military area. No specific date was specified for when to use the German Mark. At the same time, the residents of Berlin are terrified because the "Battle of Berlin" is about to begin. They know that the "economic sanctions" mentioned in Sokolovsky's circular will cause the most suffering to the Germans in the three Western districts of Berlin. It is heard that the new currency system promulgated by the Soviet authorities is also to exchange 1 new currency for 10 old Deutsche Marks. The detailed rules are expected to be announced soon.

### New Marks Appear in the Western Occupation Zone of Berlin

The Soviet Union Orders the Berlin Municipal Government to Confiscate Them

[Reuters Berlin, 3rd] German news agency news, the authorities of the three British, American and French districts, have today applied the new German Marks of West Germany in the American, French and British districts of Berlin.

[Reuters Berlin, 23rd] Although the announcement of the authorities of the three powers did not announce the exact date for the implementation of the new Mark in West Berlin, according to the German news agency registered with the United States, the new Mark has appeared in the British and American districts of Berlin.

[Reuters Berlin, 23rd] German news agency news, the Soviet authorities have recently ordered the Berlin Municipal Government to confiscate all Deutsche Marks circulating in Greater Berlin (Greater Berlin includes the three British, American and French districts and the Soviet district)

### West Germany Implements New Tax Law to Suit the Situation After the Monetary Reform

[Reuters Frankfurt, 22nd] The revised West German tax law has been announced on the 22nd, reducing income tax and wage and salary income tax in the British, American and French occupation zones by nearly one-third to suit the situation after the monetary reform.

### Former German Workers Demonstrate at the Berlin City Council

[United Press Berlin, 23rd] The Berlin City Council was about to discuss the monetary system reform issue today. Suddenly, about 300 German workers, divided into Soviet trucks, rushed to the front of the council. Two hundred male and female workers shouted "We only want a new currency in Berlin" and rushed into the venue. The councilors were prevented from entering. The council is located in the Soviet occupation zone, and the police turned a blind eye to the demonstrators.

[Reuters London, 22nd] Warsaw telex, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has arrived in Warsaw. Since yesterday, there have been rumors that the foreign ministers of Eastern European countries have left their capitals to attend a meeting of the Communist Information Bureau somewhere in Eastern Europe, but the meeting place has not been specified. Molotov's arrival in Warsaw confirms that the meeting of the Communist Information Bureau is being held in Warsaw. Diplomatic observers attach great importance to the time when this meeting of the Communist Information Bureau is convened. The communique to be issued after the meeting is expected to condemn the Western allies for destroying the unity of Germany, and will announce the unanimous unity of the Eastern European countries to resist the European Recovery Program. The participation of the leaders of the German Communist Party in this meeting is also worthy of attention. The communist parties of France and Italy are also members of the Communist Information Bureau. The Italian communist leader Togliatti and the leader of the French communist members of Parliament, Duclos, are expected to participate in the meeting in Warsaw. The two have reportedly left Rome and Paris a few days ago.

### Soviet Union Uses Veto on International Control of Atomic Energy Program The Case Will be Handled by the UN General Assembly This Autumn

[French News Agency, Lake Success, 22nd] The Soviet Union today used its 26th veto in the Security Council to veto the US proposal to transfer the atomic energy control issue to the General Assembly. The US proposal included the Atomic Energy Commission's proposals based on the implementation of the Baruch Plan. When the Security Council voted on the US proposal, nine countries voted in favor, and the Soviet Union and Ukraine voted against. The Soviet Union's negative vote had veto power. At this point, the Canadian representative suggested submitting the report of the Atomic Energy Commission to the General Assembly. Soviet representative Gromyko opposed it, calling it procedural, but the Canadian suggestion was finally passed at the meeting.

### Dewey Holds Absolute Advantage on the Eve of the Republican Presidential Nomination The Line Preventing Dewey's Election Has Collapsed

[Reuters Philadelphia, 23rd] Among the Republican presidential candidates, Dewey has the highest voice for election. McCormick, the editor of the Chicago Forum, told reporters that unless there is an unexpected one-sided situation, Dewey will definitely be elected.

[United Press Philadelphia, 23rd] The joint front preventing Dewey's election collapsed on the morning of the 23rd, making Dewey hold the victory for the Republican presidential nomination in 1948. But he still has to defeat Senator Taft, who, when meeting with the Ohio delegation on the 23rd morning, still said that he would fight to the end.

It is generally believed that the leaders who prevented Dewey's election will still plan to meet on the 23rd and try to work hard. If they cannot produce an open compromise, Dewey will have no opponent when voting on the 24th. Pennsylvania Governor Duff is a strong obstacle to Dewey, but Dewey has broken through his defense line. In the 73 votes in Pennsylvania, he can get at least 28 votes. Many state delegations held primary meetings on the 23rd, and some major delegations may make public their positions. Dewey may obtain valuable votes from them. The effort to unite the strength of Taft, Stassen and Vandenberg to attack Dewey failed in a series of meetings on the evening of the 22nd and the morning of the 23rd, but it is expected that Stassen and Taft will still meet on the 23rd, and other meetings will follow. When the Pennsylvania delegation holds a primary meeting on the evening of the 23rd, there may be new developments in the movement to prevent Dewey's election. If Duff can control a considerable majority, the movement to prevent Dewey will still have a glimmer of hope. If Duff fails, this huge delegation will immediately collapse and turn to support Dewey.

[United Press Philadelphia, 22nd] The competition for the Republican presidential nomination is in full swing. New York Governor Dewey has gained three major advantages today: (1) Persuading Pennsylvania's "darling" Martin to withdraw from the competition; (2) Advising Martin to nominate Dewey; (3) Trying to list Dewey first on the list of candidates at tomorrow's conference. It is also heard that at least four of the nine representatives from Wisconsin who support MacArthur are also preparing to change to supporting Dewey.

[United Press Philadelphia, 21st] Senator Martin (not Speaker of the House Martin) announced on the 22nd that he would give up the Republican presidential nomination and declare that he would deliver a nomination speech for Dewey. This sudden statement will certainly increase Dewey's advantageous position in this competition.

### Before US-Soviet Relations are Clear, the Japanese Peace Conference is Postponed Straight Four-Power Opinions Still Differ Greatly

[United Press Washington, 23rd] Authoritative sources claimed that the United States has decided to temporarily postpone the issue of convening a Japanese peace conference until the general relations between the United States and the Soviet Union can be closer. Therefore, the US government will not make efforts to convene a peace conference this year. Action for the next year does not depend on Japan, or even other Far Eastern countries, but will depend on the general situation of great power politics at that time. The decision of the US top authorities is based on the following two factors. If the Soviet Union participates in the peace conference, there will be no results. But if the Soviet Union does not participate in the peace conference, it is dangerous. Therefore, the United States is not prepared to obtain a compromise on the procedural difficulties between the United States and Britain. Britain advocates that all related countries participating in the peace conference should have equal status and abolish the veto power of the great powers. But the Soviet Union insisted that the peace treaty should be drafted by the four powers alone, and the veto power should be applied during the drafting. US officials believe that even if the procedures of the peace conference can be resolved, and the United States, China, Britain and the Soviet Union can all agree, the peace conference will still not achieve constructive achievements, or it will cause new frictions between the allies.

### Amidst the Talks of Peace Between Arabs and Jews, Internal Strife Occurs in the Jewish Army Irgun Soldiers Occupy the Northern Coast of the Jewish Capital

[Reuters Tel Aviv, 23rd] Under the fierce fighting between the Irgun warriors and the Israeli regular army, they have occupied the entire coast north of Tel Aviv this morning.

[United Press Rhodes, 22nd] Four Jewish experts have recently arrived here by plane, and four Arab experts arrived on the 21st. UN Mediator Bernadotte is drafting a proposal for consideration by both parties. Mr. Bei declared that he decided to set up a truce monitoring headquarters in Haifa, and he stayed in the mediation headquarters on Rhodes.

[Reuters London, 22nd] UN Palestinian truce observers have conducted an on-the-spot investigation into the conflict between the Israeli regular army and the Irgun personnel. The Irgun radio station in Tel Aviv said that when Irgun personnel were unloading weapons from Europe on the coast of Tel Aviv yesterday, they were interfered with by the Israeli army, resulting in several deaths and injuries. However, the Jewish official gazette did not report the details of the conflict. The Israeli Command had known in advance that a ship of the Irgun would dock on the coast of Palestine with weapons, so it had already been engaged in a blockade at the landing site. An Israeli gunboat first met the ship and told it that landing in Palestine would cause serious consequences, but the captain of the ship did not allow Israeli naval personnel to board the ship for inspection. When the conflict broke out, the Israeli army immediately began to be on alert in Tel Aviv, and the government announced that it would suppress any attempt to defy its authority. When the ship unloaded the weapons at noon, 20 Irgun commandos wearing steel helmets forcibly landed on the Tel Aviv coast to establish a beachhead. The landing site was only 50 meters away from the UN office here. They also used loudspeakers to ask the Israeli army not to shoot, but shortly after the Irgun personnel landed, the Israeli army shot. The machine gun in the munitions on the ship then exploded. The apartments and hotels near the coast have been evacuated to prevent danger. The radio report received by the London Naval Department said that the Israeli army was bombarding the munitions ship with artillery fire. The ship was on fire, and the people in the ship wanted to escape to the shore, but were blocked by machine gun fire on the shore. It is expected that other Irgun troops on land may attack the Israeli army.

### US Republican National Convention Passes New Foreign Policy Platform: Vandenberg Internationalist Faction Achieves Victory

[Central News Agency, Philadelphia, 22nd] The US Republican National Convention today passed the foreign policy section of its platform, the main purpose of which is to maintain a "peace of justice," engage in international cooperation, abandon "appeasement," reaffirm its support for a "bipartisan foreign policy," and assist all peace-loving nations in restoring and guaranteeing their political and economic freedom. Its passage is widely regarded as a victory for internationalism under the leadership of Vandenberg. It is noted that the passage of the United Nations Charter, the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the China Aid Act, and the extension of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in the United States Congress was largely due to Vandenberg's efforts. The passage of the platform also represents a defeat for the conservative faction led by House Speaker Martin and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Taber. To clearly demonstrate the United States' deep concern for the stability, security, and freedom of other independent nations, the platform includes an item related to China, the original text of which states: "We will foster and uphold the historical policy of friendship toward China. We have a profound interest in maintaining China's integrity and freedom." Republicans are confident in their party's prospects in the general election and invite Democrats to cooperate with them in formulating future foreign policy, avoiding partisan strife in this area.

### House Speaker Martin Urges Democrats to Step Down

[United Press, Philadelphia, 22nd] After assuming the position of permanent chairman of the Republican National Convention, House Speaker Martin delivered a speech strongly urging the Democrats to step down first. He stated that if the Republican Party is to further control Congress, it must seize the White House, and he predicted a victory in November. At the same time, he strongly refuted President Truman's attack on the Eightieth Congress as "the second worst Congress in history." Martin, due to his neutral position as chairman of the convention, avoided mentioning his personal ambitions but criticized the failures of the Democratic administration. Martin said: "The Republican members of Congress have done their utmost to give the American people a 'unified and harmonious' government. The bravest and most effective blow the American people can contribute is to elect a Republican president in November."

### United States to Participate in Western European Defense Agreement

[Our Newspaper] New York, 23rd broadcast: Washington dispatch, Deputy Secretary of State Lovett told reporters today that the United States is about to contact the nations of the Western European Alliance to discuss the United States' participation in the Western European regional defense agreement. This resolution was proposed by Vandenberg and has been passed by the Senate.

### Seven Cases of Illegal Foreign Exchange and Gold Speculation Uncovered, Involving 139 Businesses; Remittance Funds Reach Over 350 Billion

The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters Investigation Office, in conjunction with the Police Bureau's Economic Police Brigade, recently conducted a large-scale inspection of the gold and foreign currency black market and private Hong Kong dollar exchange institutions based on a blacklist. The inspected establishments included 16 businesses such as Cai Mingshan at 160 Zhongzheng East Road. Among them, nine cases, including Zhenchang Jewelry at 452 Hankou Road, Xinkang Pen Shop at 100 Central Building, Central Road, Feisheng Tobacco Shop at 887 Linsen Middle Road, Yingfan Store at 645 Xiafei Road, 142 Hengde Lane, 633 Changde Road, 43 Nanhui Road, Yuanda Store at Room 431, 131 Huqiu Road, and Xu Liping at 288 Dongchangzhi Road, 457 Ningbo Road, were deemed to lack sufficient evidence and are still under investigation. The remaining seven cases, after review by the Economic Section of the Garrison Headquarters Investigation Office and relevant agencies such as the Gold Control Bureau, were deemed to be of significant suspicion and have been transferred to the Special Criminal Court for interrogation. According to the Garrison Headquarters' announcement, the related companies, businesses, or individuals involved in remittance in these seven cases, for which evidence has been found, number 139, and the funds remitted by these companies, businesses, and individuals amount to over 350 billion yuan. The list of the seven cases uncovered is as follows: (1) Gantai Flower Shop, Room 421, 160 Zhongzheng East Road, was caught on the spot reporting gold prices and illegally exchanging Hong Kong dollars, with a remittance amount of 5.2 billion yuan. (2) Li Huifeng of Dachang Shop, No. 5, Lane 107, Henan Road, was found to be engaged in gold and foreign currency speculation. The shop's transaction records were detected in advance, and three taels of gold and two gold rings were seized on the spot. (3) Li Kecheng of Sanyu Elementary School, 183 Wujin Road, illegally exchanged Hong Kong dollars. The suspect used teaching as a cover to engage in illegal Hong Kong dollar exchange. Telegrams, remittance receipts, letters, and codes related to the illegal exchange were seized on the spot. (4) He Zhanyun, Room 7, 3rd Floor, 304 Jiangxi Middle Road, illegally exchanged Hong Kong dollars and operated a gauze and grain business without a license, admitting to a single illegal exchange of 2 billion yuan. The individuals and businesses involved in the entrustment in this case include Wang Qingchang, Zhang Tongxing, Cheng Yongming, Xinhua West, Tao Zhenquan, and Chen Xiru. (5) Tu Zijin of Jinshan Company, 190 Beijing Road, ostensibly engaged in the paint business as a cover, secretly engaging in gold and foreign currency transactions. One large gold bar and ledgers of receipts and dispatches related to gold and foreign currency transactions were seized on the spot. (6) Tang Yunzhong, also known as Tang Yaoan and Huang Guocheng, using the alias Tang Yunzhong at 987 North Sichuan Road, engaged in Hong Kong dollar exchange. Letters related to illegal exchange sent from Hong Kong and 82 original and duplicate remittance receipts, totaling 45 billion yuan, were seized on the spot. In addition, 8,221,114,600 yuan in bills were seized.

### Three Sessions of the Senate Assembly; Inquiries to Five Bureaus and One Committee Mostly Related to Real-World Issues

[Our Newspaper] The sixth session of the Municipal Senate held its third meeting yesterday. Starting at 3:30 p.m., the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee first reported on the rice distribution situation. Subsequently, the inquiry began, with senators successively questioning the Police, Social Affairs, Land Administration, Civil Affairs, and Health Bureaus, as well as the People's Food Adjustment Committee. A total of 33 people were involved. The focus of the inquiry was on urgent and realistic difficult issues such as the black market for gold and foreign currency, harassment by economic police, rising rice prices, and the accuracy of the cost of living index. The inquiry concluded at 6:55 p.m., and was extended by half an hour. The directors of the Police and Social Affairs Bureaus provided preliminary oral responses, while the remaining responses were converted to written form. The meeting ended smoothly at 7:40 p.m.

A total of 161 senators attended yesterday's meeting. The deadline for collecting proposals was also yesterday afternoon, with a total of 128 proposals received. Today and tomorrow will be devoted to review meetings by each group. Starting at 9:00 a.m. today, the Finance, Social Affairs, and Public Utilities groups will meet, and starting at 3:00 p.m., the Education, Police Affairs, Autonomy, and Public Works Urban Planning Review Committees will separately review the relevant proposals from each group.

At the beginning of yesterday's meeting, the Secretariat reported that the Senate had dispatched Jiang Hao, Zhu Yiyong, and Cheng Zhong as representatives to participate in the Municipal Government's gasoline meeting on the morning of the 23rd, and that preliminary exchanges of views had taken place, pending submission to the Executive Yuan for review. Subsequently, the Chairman reported that the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee Chairman Ren was invited to attend due to the Senate's concern about the people's food situation, and to provide a 15-minute report on the committee's rice distribution methods and policies.

### Chairman Ren Reports on the Business of the Adjustment Committee

Chairman Ren's report covered three points: (1) The committee's business. Briefly, the committee, under central government orders, conducted a pilot rice distribution program for four months from March to June of this year. The business was very complex. Taking rice revenue as an example, it reached 2.5 trillion yuan in June alone, averaging nearly 100 billion yuan per day, while the total number of staff was only over 300. (2) The continuation of rice distribution. Starting in July, the central government decided to continue rice distribution. The China Relief Mission approved Shanghai's early use of US aid rice before the signing of the Sino-US bilateral agreement because of Shanghai's good rice distribution performance. In addition, the Ministry of Food also allocated 30,000 tons of brown rice, and continued to purchase from Yangon and domestic producing areas. The rice distribution certificates for July have been distributed to each district yesterday, and citizens in each district can obtain their rice distribution certificates on the 28th and 29th. If the certificates are issued, distribution is guaranteed, and the distribution price will not change within one month. Currently, active planning is underway for sources from July of this year to September of next year to ensure continuous rice distribution. (3) Personally, I still have confidence in the rice distribution system. The fundamental solution is to continue the rice distribution system and increase the amount of rice distributed so that citizens can obtain the rice they are entitled to. Although the rice disposal policy is not perfect, it is at least sufficient to stabilize rice prices in the producing areas.

### Inquiries Regarding Civil Affairs

Regarding the Civil Affairs Bureau, Huang Zhenshi and Chen Peide raised questions: (1) The head of the Baojia system is a public official, with obligations but no rights, losing the balance of affairs. They should have the same right to enjoy the allocation of materials as public education personnel. (2) When will the self-defense force be formed? (3) What is the progress of the cooperative societies being operated by each Baojia?

### The Disconnection Between the Cost of Living Index and Prices Is Too Great, and There Seems to Be a Suspicion of Artificial Control

At 5:15 p.m., after the inquiry to the Police Bureau was completed, a ten-minute break was taken, and the inquiry to the Social Affairs Bureau began. Those who raised questions included Zhang Zhihan, Zhang Zhongyuan, Wang Zonghao, Fan Xipin, Yan Miaosheng, Fei Shusheng, Ding Shanming, and Zhou Xuexiang. The main points of the inquiry were as follows: (1) The dance hall case has been delayed for nearly five months and has not yet been adjudicated. Can the Social Affairs Bureau open the net and not pursue it further? (2) The president of the oil business association, Zhang Chao, was convicted of oil allocation corruption. Please investigate and reply. (3) The quality and smell of the allocated oil are poor. Please investigate the cause. (4) In labor disputes, if the labor side violates the arbitration after the record is made, they will be detained, but the capital side is not when they violate. Why? (5) Why is the price limit for the hotel industry implemented alone? (6) The labor dispute at the Jianguang Match Factory has been delayed for one year and five months. Why has no judgment been made? What is the inside story? (7) The silverware industry pays taxes according to law. Why can't it resume business? Silver shops in Beijing, Hankou, Guangzhou, Tianjin and other places all deal in gold jewelry, but Shanghai alone prohibits it. Why? (8) Why is it difficult to submit business registration certificates through the association? (9) Is the compilation of the cost of living index accurate? The workers' index last month was 337,000 times higher, the staff's index was 280,000 times higher, and the wholesale price index has reached 1.24 million times higher. The ratio between the two is four to one. The cost of living index is too far behind, and I deeply feel that there is a suspicion of artificial control. At the same time, it is said that the mayor should strive for adjustments from the central government for the public education personnel index. (10) Why must household sugar be purchased from designated sugar stores? Can the method of allocating oil and rice be followed in the future, allowing citizens to choose the stores that distribute it?

### Doctors Disregard Morality, Attention Should Be Paid to Correction

Regarding the Health Bureau, Chu Shun, Fan Shouyuan, Jiang Hao, Yan Esheng, Fu Xiaofeng, and Chen Baotai raised questions, including: (1) Many public hospitals do not save lives without money. Please investigate. (2) A few doctors disregard professional ethics and are irresponsible. Attention should be paid to correction. (3) There are too many employees in the First Slaughterhouse. Can it be reduced? (4) The fees collected by the slaughterhouse are far above the costs required for slaughter. Why? (5) The materials transferred to the Health Bureau after the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration ended were for the distribution of patients. Why did the Health Bureau allocate them to the staff of the bureau? (6) During Children's Day this year, the Materials Supply Bureau auctioned off a large batch of moldy candies. Has the Health Bureau paid attention to it? And if mold is found, will it be banned?

### Director Wu Is Confident and Has Enough Tolerance; No Intention of Retaliation for the Dance Hall Case

Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau replied to the inquiry, saying: I am confident that I have enough tolerance and will never intend to retaliate for the dance hall case. Because workers often cause labor disputes and affect social order when they disagree with the ruling, as an emergency measure, the police bureau had to maintain order first. When the capital side violates, they are sent to the court for review and handling. Admitting that the labor side is not without loss, we should still find ways to seek fairness in the future. I am clear in my conscience about the handling of the American Radiator Standard Sanitary incident. I did not rigidly stipulate that the silverware industry cannot resume business. However, if gold jewelry is sold in the black market and is subject to legal interference, I cannot be responsible. Shops that handle household sugar must pay first and then receive the sugar, which is different from the oil and rice that are received first and paid later. Therefore, there are regulations for purchasing from designated sugar stores, and I will discuss improving the method with the Taiwan Sugar Corporation.

### Yu Shuping Responds to Inquiries; Gold and Foreign Currency Case Handled Under Orders

Director Yu of the Police Bureau was the first to take the stage and give a brief reply. He said: The division of powers between the Police Bureau and the Garrison Headquarters is currently lacking specific provisions. For more serious gold and foreign currency cases, the central government has ordered the Garrison Headquarters to handle them directly. The Lin Wang and Sanwei cases have been transferred to the special court for handling under the instructions of the central government. The Public Development Warehouse incident is currently being investigated by the Supervisory Commissioner's Office and the District Procuratorate. As a precautionary measure, orders have been issued to all districts to conduct a thorough investigation of the storage of dangerous goods in the district, and to order improvements. Economic police were established based on the Internal Affairs Ministry's Mobilization and Suppression of Rebellion Regulations. After the establishment, it can at least prevent prices from soaring. The people in charge of economic police are mostly well-educated and experienced people, and the police officers are all high school graduates and understand economic laws and regulations, so the quality is still high. The Flying Fortress takes its meaning from Flying Squadron, and it does have considerable effect. The Rongjun incident is under the jurisdiction of the military police and the Garrison Headquarters. I have always paid great attention to the discipline of police officers. I have investigated and punished many subordinates after taking office, which shows my determination to rectify discipline.

### The First Shot of the Congress Was to Question the Police Bureau: Why Was the Large-Scale Black Market Gold and Foreign Currency Case All Bark and No Bite?

Starting at 3:50 p.m., the inquiry to the Police Bureau began. Senators Wu Zhengshi, Zhao Junhao, Shao Yongsheng, Yan Esheng, Ma Junshuo, Chen Bogan, Pan Jamei, Huang Zhenshi, Tong Xiang, Wei Yunqing, Xie Dahuang, Yang Fusheng and other twelve people raised questions in turn. The key points of the inquiry are summarized as follows: (1) How is the division of powers between the Police Bureau and the Garrison Headquarters in investigating and banning gold and foreign currency and opium? (2) Why were the responsible personnel of the Public Development Warehouse incident not sent to the judicial organs for handling? Is there any suspicion of dereliction of duty? And what are the prevention plans for similar cases in the future? (3) Although some large-scale black market gold and foreign currency cases have been uncovered, the result is all bark and no bite. What is the reason? Please announce the handling process of the Lin Wang Sanwei case. (4) Economic police often harass citizens because of searching for black market gold and foreign currency. In the future, for reporting cases, can we secretly investigate first before taking action? (5) Why are the mobile silver dollar stalls on the streets allowed to exist? (6) Some soldiers who call themselves Rongjun harass various shops. Why not investigate and arrest them? (7) What is the legal basis for the establishment of the Economic Police Brigade? What is the benefit to stabilizing prices, and what is the quality of the personnel? (8) Smuggling is rampant in Yangshupu, Zhabei and other districts. It is said that the police officers in these districts collude with local ruffians, and small shops are harassed. Please investigate and rectify your subordinates. (9) In labor disputes, police officers use the opportunity to collude with the capital side and suppress the labor side. (10) Why do the police often turn a blind eye to beggars robbing cotton and miscellaneous goods loaded on trucks?

### The Cost of Living Index and Prices Are Like a Tortoise and Hare Race: Director Wu Said the Loss Is in the Rent Standard

Thirteen is an unlucky number, which has become a convention. The thirteenth seat in the Senate was temporarily vacant at this meeting.

The congress opened until about 5:30 p.m., and each person was given a steamed bun (two). It is said that the Senate sets 280 guests every day. At the fifth congress, each steamed bun was 12,000 yuan, and this time it has risen to 35,000 yuan.

Wu Zhengshi said when questioning the Police Bureau that the end of many gold and foreign currency cases always says that it involves a wide range, and also says that it is related to a certain important person, and as a result, there is often no follow-up. It is really a dragon that sees its head but not its tail, and the big cases have become fish that slip through the net.

Shao Yongsheng questioned that many of the economic police are traffic police. They take the usual skills of controlling traffic lights and run to the stock market and yarn market, saying that they are only allowed to fall, not to rise. Price control does not seem to be that simple.

He also said: The Flying Fortress, as the name suggests, should be flying in the sky, but in reality, it is a few jeeps crawling on the ground, which is purely a new term to be creative.

The New Asia Hotel forgot to put camphor pills in the urinal, and was fined by the police bureau, and the owner must go to the police bureau in person to be interrogated. Yan Esheng said that this is close to harassment.

Everyone said that Shanghai is currently living through the dark steps before the light, but Ma Junshuo said that Shanghai has recently encountered terrible light day and night - that is, the fires that are one after another.

Some police bureaus often have people go to various shops to tell them that they need to "contact" someone when something happens. What is the reason for this? Several senators mentioned it in the inquiry yesterday.

After Xie Dahuang's long series of inquiries, he said that Director Yu is a standard officer, gentle and elegant, which made Director Yu only shake his head and smile wryly.

Zhang Zhongyuan shouted that now you only need a package of three forts to open a hotel room for a day. If the hotel industry wants to limit prices again, in less than a month, more than 1,000 hotels in Shanghai will have to close down.

The smell of the allocated oil is unbearable. Senator Wang Zonghao, who used to run a mill, said: The smell is like the fresh paint on a dead man's coffin.

There are plenty of ways to buy large gold bars of ten or twenty in Shanghai, but small people who want to buy one or two taels of gold jewelry have no way to buy them. What is this phenomenon? Yan Esheng strongly argued for the resumption of business in the silverware industry.

Fei Shusheng said that the current cost of living index is a tortoise, and the actual price is a rabbit. The farther you chase, the farther the distance.

In the voices of various Yang sisters emerging one after another, Jiang Hao asked the Health Bureau whether there were people in Shanghai who did not eat, and whether there was an inspection of the price.

Director Yu said when replying to the inquiry that economic police are "doing a lot of work without getting any credit." If the senators think that their existence is useless, the bureau can consider canceling it.

Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau claimed to be an honest man, and as a result, he always suffered losses. The reason why the silverware industry in this city cannot resume business is because he is too obedient to the central government's orders.

He said: He is willing to guarantee the absolute accuracy of the cost of living index with his personality. The low cost of living index is due to the fact that the rent standard is limited to 7,000 times, and rent accounts for a pivotal proportion in the cost of living index.

### Why Do Rice Prices Still Rise After Rice Distribution?

Those who questioned the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee included Chu Shun, Xia, and Lu Yinchu. The main issues were: (1) The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee's work report in March stated that the total number of employees was over 400, which is quite different from the 300 reported by Chairman Ren. So how many employees are there? (2) What are the monthly expenses of the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee? (3) What are the expenses for each dan of rice distributed by the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee? (4) Why have rice prices continued to rise after rice distribution? (5) The rice distribution certificate has two-part tickets for allocation and purchase. The purchase part is now completely useless. Why not save it? (6) Where is the rice disposal going? What is the effect of the rice disposal?

### Little Interest in Land Issues; Only a Few Words of Inquiry

Only Zhang Zhongyuan and Jiang Hao questioned the Land Administration Bureau. The questions were: (1) There are facts of bribery in the Land Administration Bureau when issuing land ownership certificates. I am willing to provide investigations. (2) What is the implementation of the rent standard after it is announced?

### Index Compilation; The General Labor Union Suggests Improvements; Reasonable Adjustment of Weights and Quality Should Be Published Every Half Month

Since last month, the price of goods in this city has fluctuated more violently. The labor unions of various industries in the city believe that the cost of living index in May is far from the price of goods, and they have successively reported to the General Labor Union to accuse them and suggest improvements. After the Cost of Living Index Research Association discussed and submitted it to the 46th Board Meeting, it was decided to discuss various methods to treat this symptom, and officially submitted it to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, requesting adoption and implementation. The main points are as follows:

(A) Symptomatic treatment: (1) This time, the government generally distributed rice, and the citizens eat 500,000 yuan per dou. The difference between it and the market price is actually a benefit that the government bestows on the people, and workers are also citizens of this city and should enjoy this benefit. However, the cost of living index is calculated at the distribution price, and it is as high as five dou, which is tantamount to deducting the difference in the rice distribution from the workers. Therefore, this household rice distribution is only for people in agriculture, commerce and academia, and workers are not involved. Therefore, it is proposed to calculate one dou according to the distribution price, and the rest according to the market price. (2) Please calculate coal balls according to the market price, because workers have not received the allocated goods, and the cost of living index is calculated at the distribution price, so it is difficult to remain silent. (3) The weekly survey of prices must be improved, because the turnover of prices has been shortened recently, and the fluctuations are very violent, with the market prices being different in the morning and evening. If you want to be fair and reasonable, you should change the survey to once a day. (4) The cost of living index should be changed to be published once every half month, because each factory usually pays wages every half month, so that the workers' income can be used for the current month, and the wages currently paid are calculated based on the index of the previous month. (B) Fundamental treatment: (1) A household survey should be conducted immediately to be practical. (2) The quality weights of the items listed in the index should be reasonably adjusted to meet the actual needs of the workers.

### The Go-Slow Incident Has Been Resolved and Customs Work Has Returned to Normal

[Our Newspaper] According to Zhang Yongnian, the Chief of the Jianghai Customs, the go-slow incident at the customs, which lasted for several days, has been formally resolved because all employees have accepted persuasion. Therefore, all work inside and outside the customs has returned to normal. However, according to customs employees, they are not satisfied with the three points of the Standing Committee's reply, especially the request to increase treatment has not been specifically concluded, so they are not very interested in resuming work. Although the customs work proceeded as usual yesterday, the employees' emotions seemed very lazy.

### The Texaco Company Kerosene Dispute Has Been Resolved

[Our Newspaper] The Texaco Kerosene Company workers and the company had a dispute due to issues such as requesting the distribution of kerosene.

### Soviet Vessel "Smolny" Arrives in Port, "Atun" Returns to Vladivostok

### Senators Propose Expanding Stock Market Trading

City Senators Xu Yongzuo, Zhang Yiqu, Yao Baozhen, Yu Shun, Yan Esheng, Zhao Junhao, Zhou Chengxiang, Wang Guoxian, Gao Shuan, Zhu Liangcai, and others submitted a proposal to the Senate yesterday, requesting the Municipal Government to forward it to the Ministries of Finance and Industry, instructing the Shanghai Stock Exchange to strengthen its internal structure and expand stock market trading. The rationale is as follows: It is a well-known fact that the city is awash in idle capital. Apart from the small number of unscrupulous individuals who engage in black market currency speculation and adopt an "escape" abroad, the remainder of this idle capital is invested either in the stock market or in the commodity market. Consequently, holders of idle capital are either buying commodities and selling stocks, or buying stocks and selling commodities. However, weighing the relative importance of the two, it seems that channeling idle capital into the stock market is a better strategy. Directing idle capital to the commodity market can cause prices to rise wildly. For example, after the Gold Control Bureau implemented the policy of not allowing same-day checks to be used as collateral on June 1st of this year, holders of idle capital immediately bought commodities and sold stocks, causing the stock market to decline universally while prices soared. This is one example. Therefore, if the government wishes to stabilize prices and prevent idle capital from disrupting the commodity market, it should immediately strengthen the stock exchange and expand stock market trading to absorb large amounts of idle capital and prevent it from becoming a widespread problem. This proactive channeling is more effective in the long run than the passive tightening of credit.

### "Newly Revised Map of China by Provinces" to be Published Post-War

The "New Map of China by Provinces" published by Shen Bao was first conceived in the spring of the 19th year of the Republic [1930] and the first edition was published in the 22nd year of the Republic [1933]. The compilers, Ding Wenjiang, Weng Wenhao, and Zeng Shiying, used the latest measurement materials and cartographic methods of the time. After its publication, it was highly praised in cultural and educational circles. Universities and middle schools adopted it widely, and it was repeatedly revised and reprinted. By the 28th year of the Republic [1939], it had reached its fourth edition. Later, due to the escalating war, revision work had to be temporarily suspended, making it difficult to find on the market. Shen Bao, recognizing that the wartime military operations led to a wealth of new information about topography and geography not found in previous maps, and that significant changes have occurred in geographical divisions, including the restoration of Taiwan, the recovery of the Northeast provinces, provincial divisions, the construction of highways and transportation, and the addition of railways and seaports, has made a correct and up-to-date map an urgent necessity. After the victory, Shen Bao commissioned Weng Wenhao, Zeng Shiying, and Fang Jun to re-compile the map based on actual measurement data, with assistance from the National Defense Ministry's Survey Bureau and the Central Geological Survey, and with reference to numerous books. After more than two years of effort, the newly revised fifth edition, named "Newly Revised Map of China by Provinces Post-War," will be published soon. Not only is the content rich and accurate, but the printing is also exquisite, far exceeding pre-war standards. The map is available in both hardcover and paperback editions. The hardcover edition is a 16mo volume with a hard cover, containing 29 sheets of 8vo maps, totaling 39 maps, printed in seven colors on 100-pound art paper, with a glued spine. When opened, it can be laid flat. In addition to provincial maps, it also includes a general topographic map, a general political region map, a map of important mineral distribution, a climate map, a soil distribution map, a map of important cities and population distribution, and a linguistic region map, providing detailed coverage of all aspects. An index of over eighty pages is included at the end of the map for easy lookup of place names. The paperback edition is an 8vo volume with a saddle-stitch binding, containing 16 pages and 35 maps. The paper and printing are identical to the hardcover edition. The only difference is that the hardcover edition is printed on one side of the page, while the paperback edition is printed on both sides. The index is omitted, which saves paper and makes the price more affordable, making it ideal for students.

### Only Son of Two Families Dies Tragically Under Wheels; Family Demands 5 Billion Yuan in Compensation and Pension

[Report from Our Newspaper] Lu Zunjia, the 34-year-old only son of two families, was riding his bicycle on Dongchangzhi Road, near Tanggu Road, on the 17th of last month when he was struck by a ten-wheeled truck belonging to the Materials Supply Bureau. The bicycle was destroyed and Lu was injured. He was taken to the hospital for treatment but ultimately died from excessive blood loss. The driver, Gu Shoushan, was handed over by the police to the District Prosecutor's Office. It was discovered that the driver did not have a driver's license, so he was prosecuted for negligent injury resulting in death. Yesterday morning, the Third Criminal Court of the District Court held a hearing. The victim's mother, Lu Cai, who is 60 years old, and his four-year-old son, Zhao Di, who is too young to understand, were represented in court by his wife, Lu Yan, who filed a civil claim seeking compensation. They argued that the director of the Bureau, Jiang Biao, should be held jointly liable for the compensation because he did not exercise due diligence in hiring the driver. The victim's family requested a total of 5 billion yuan for support expenses, funeral expenses, and consolation money. Jiang Biao did not appear in court yesterday and was represented by lawyers Yan Fangfu, Hu Cansan, and Zhao Jintang, who argued in his defense. After the hearing, the court adjourned the case for further proceedings at a later date.

### Airline Company Case: Four Defendants Required to Pay Additional Bail

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case against China and Central Airlines for allegedly increasing fares without authorization and colluding with merchants for fraudulent purposes was heard for the first time by Judge Lian Zhenbang of the District Court at 2:00 PM yesterday. All defendants except the three who are fugitives and Yan Duzhou were present in court with their lawyers. After confirming their names and origins, they were questioned separately. Liu Anping of China Airlines stated, "Zhou Peiran of Huamao Company was the former director of the Gui Sui office of China Airlines. He was suspended from his position due to suspected smuggling and I have not met him since. Zhou chartered planes from the company using the name of Jinshan Company. The high freight rate of 21,200 yuan per catty was entirely voluntary. As a commercial enterprise, the company was happy to accept it, but I never received any 'benefits.' My role is in the business department, and the allocation of aircraft is the responsibility of the flight operations group. Both Jinshan Company in Shanghai and Huamao Company in Peiping have verifiable addresses." Jiang Nengxiang stated, "The company is a commercial enterprise, and anyone can apply for cargo transportation. The company was unaware that Zhou had increased the freight rate to more than 50,000 yuan outside and solicited passengers and cargo." Xu Xin stated, "The company uses a bidding system, and a higher freight rate is beneficial to the company. The Peiping office was instructed by the Shanghai head office to handle the matter." Xu firmly denied ever refusing cargo shipments from various companies. Finally, Deng Gaozhang of Central Airlines testified that he did not know Qi Nianzu of Dabe Company, etc. Because the company was willing to pay a high price, the company had a profit motive, and the flight operations group also agreed to allocate aircraft for transportation. He then received a telegram from Peiping asking whether to suspend other cargo shipments until Dabe Company had delivered its cargo. Shanghai instructed them by telegram to continue loading as usual, but the price should be calculated at Dabe's freight rate of 21,200 yuan per catty.

At this point, the court adjourned the hearing and instructed the four defendants to read the transcripts, make corrections, and sign them. Furthermore, because the four defendants were suspected of more serious crimes, in addition to the bail already paid to the District Prosecutor's Office, the court ordered Liu Anping and Jiang Nengxiang to pay an additional 2 billion yuan each, and Xu Xin and Deng Gaozhang to pay an additional 3 billion yuan each, in the form of written security.

### Deadline for Special Relief Donation Approaches; Only 600 Billion Raised of 8.5 Trillion Target

The special relief donation drive in this city, advocated by the Department Head, has so far raised a total of 616.625 billion yuan, as well as 100 boxes of high-efficiency internal combustion engine parts newly arrived from the United States.

The National Bank and the Yarn Control Committee held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon in President Yu's office to review the recent policy of selling off cotton yarn and cloth. The meeting was presided over by Liu Gongyun, Vice President of the National Bank. Wang Lanseng, Gao Bingtai, and Liu Wenteng, the Acting Chairmen of the Yarn Control Committee, also participated. At the meeting, the Yarn Control Committee presented a written report summarizing the amount sold in recent days and the amount of currency absorbed. The meeting then extensively reviewed a number of technical issues related to the sale. It is understood that the meeting solemnly decided that, in order to eliminate inflationary pressures, there would be no restrictions on the sale of cotton yarn and cloth in the future, in order to absorb idle capital and stabilize prices.

Yarn Prices Weak and Flat

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was weak due to the excessive gains in recent days, which made people uneasy. Also, credit in the market tightened, and sales were sluggish. Many sellers were eager to sell, and the bulls also took profits. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened down 48 million yuan. Midway through the day, prices fell further due to heavy selling. Near the close, outside capital poured in, and buying interest in the market increased, ultimately closing at 655 million yuan, flat with the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn were down 3-4 million to 20-30 million yuan compared to the previous day.

Cotton Cloth Sharply Declines

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was weak as the end of the month approached and banks tightened credit. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning sharply down 1 million from the previous close, and sellers were eager to sell. Subsequently, due to dumping from Hankou and northern provinces, the market gradually declined to 13.5 million yuan. Midway through the day, merchants from Guangdong made substantial purchases of yuan twill, and overnight floating losses were offset, with prices rebounding slightly by 500,000 yuan, reaching 14.7 million yuan. Later, prices rose again to 14.7 million yuan. Near the close, as yarn prices fell, sentiment weakened, and bulls turned sellers, falling slightly back to 14.4 million yuan, ultimately closing at 13.65 million yuan. Prices for various fine cloths fell by 200,000-300,000 to 800,000-900,000 and 1.05 million yuan compared to the previous day. Twill was greatly affected by the quota allocation, falling by a substantial 1.05 million yuan. Other cloths also followed the decline, but yuan cloth, blue cloth, and shilin cloth prices rose by 100,000-200,000 yuan due to the soaring price of dyes.

### Chinese Stocks Weak at First, Then Firm; Government Bonds Down; Foreign Stocks Flat and Weak

However, the market gradually improved later, and it was easy to recover. Near the close, it presented a see-sawing pattern.

In the afternoon, Yong Yarn opened at 4,100 yuan.

Two firms suspended trading for three days, and Nos. 130 and 155 sold off to 4,130 yuan. Afterwards, the National Bank's trading imbalance was more than 29 trillion, but there was a rumor in the market that it was only 2.9 trillion. The market was weak first, then strong. Nos. 187, 157, and 145 advanced to 4,210 yuan, while Nos. 130 and 131 sold off to 4,130 yuan. The close was 4,160 yuan.

### Credit Tightening Leads to Drop in Prices of Various Commodities; Rice Market Inflation Gradually Stabilizes; Flour, Grains, and Oil Cakes All Decline

Yesterday, the rice market rose first, then leveled off, with the closing price similar to the previous day. The future market showed a slight decline, lower by 100,000-200,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The market opened higher in the morning due to high prices in Wuxi. Especially in the South City market, which opened early, prices were shouted up by 500,000-600,000 yuan. However, due to the tightening of credit, sellers took advantage of the high prices to sell, and prices soon turned downward. After that, prices fell all the way down, especially glutinous rice, which was soft. In the North City market, white japonica rice held steady, while early thin rice was down 100,000-200,000 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 3,611 dan of rice arrived in the North and South markets.

Flour opened slightly lower, but sales were minimal. Then, due to tight credit, sellers dumped their goods.

### Local Business Conditions

Wuxi [This newspaper's Wuxi dispatch from the 23rd] State-run banks have been calling in loans consecutively in recent days, leading to an extraordinarily tight money supply and a sharp rise in black market interest rates. However, confidence remains high, and prices of various goods have not declined; on the contrary, they are trending upward, especially for cotton yarn and rice.

Publishing World

### Farewell

— Traditional First

Today I received a notice from the newspaper stating that due to the implementation of reductions in scope and the difficulty in allocating space, the decision has been made to discontinue all seven weekly publications starting July 1st. Therefore, we can only bid farewell to our readers. "Publishing World" has been the longest-running of the weekly publications in this newspaper. This on the one hand shows the spirit of academic promotion of the editorial department of this newspaper, and on the other hand is due to the enthusiastic love and support of readers and writers. This time, due to the limitations of paper and space, it is necessary to stop the weekly publication, which is unavoidable, and I hope readers will forgive the newspaper's difficulties.

This editor plans to go to the United States this summer. On the one hand, I want to enrich my own knowledge and work hard to learn more about Western culture and thought; on the other hand, I will respond to the invitations of several universities there to talk about Chinese academic thought, hoping to make a small contribution to promoting the spirit of the Chinese nation and communicating Eastern and Western cultures. When I was worrying about how to continue the editorial work of "Publishing World," I heard the news that the weekly publication would be discontinued, which relieved me of a great burden.

However, I must express my sincere apologies to the readers of this publication and the gentlemen who contribute. At a time when China's material conditions are poor and there is a famine of spiritual food, general aspiring youths and eager adult learners hope to use various economical methods to satisfy their desires for learning and progress. According to readers' reports, this publication has indeed made a small effort in this area, and we regret that this small effort cannot be continued due to material constraints. This is what we should apologize to our readers for. The country should be even more ashamed of these eager and thoughtful scholars.

The manuscripts of this publication, with the exception of a very small number of specially invited ones, are mostly contributed, and the standard of the manuscripts is generally quite high. This shows that they are all carefully crafted by the writers. We ourselves are also writers, so we cherish them very much. I never discard any of your manuscripts, whether they are used or not. Many manuscripts that I want to use are often delayed for a long time due to space limitations. In addition, the recent influx of submissions has caused us to [missing character] many good articles. Now that this publication is ceasing publication, it is bound to be [missing character], and this is another thing I must especially apologize to the contributors for.

Finally, we have [missing character] a statement regarding many unused submissions. The standard I choose is first the value of the book itself, and second the beauty of the review article. I am confident that it is quite objective. A few of the submissions introduced the editor's own writings and translations. In order to avoid the suspicion of self-promotion, they were not used, and I am deeply sorry. Many readers have inquired about my writings and translations, but I have not replied to them on weekdays. Now I can tell you that my writings and translations focus on philosophy and psychology and are published in Commercial Press, Zhonghua Bookstore, and World Book Company. To find out the titles of the books, please check the catalogs of the bookstores. Thank you for your support, and I will [missing character] you. Goodbye!

### Science and Technology

— Ming

By Zhao Zengjue, published by Zhonghua Book Company

In his book "Scientific Attitude," British biologist C.H. Waddington divides scientists into two categories: technical experts and those who think scientifically. According to him, technology is included within science; this can be considered science in a broad sense. Recently, I read Mr. Zhao Zengjue's new book "Science and Technology." From its title and content, it is clear that his understanding of science refers to pure natural science, and thus he lists it alongside technology.

Although this book is a collection of essays discussing science and technology, its theoretical framework is consistent throughout. The author believes that if China wishes to compete in the modern international arena, there is no alternative but industrialization. The foundation of industrialization lies in technology, and the foundation of technology lies in science. This is truly an irrefutable truth. He also states that the purpose of technology is "to utilize and enrich life." In other words, the purpose of technology is to serve the "people's livelihood" and "public welfare." The author believes that China's industrialization should be centered on the people's livelihood. Although the author also emphasizes national defense construction, it does not conflict with the construction of people's livelihood, because his defense theory is also centered on the people's livelihood. Obviously, without national defense, the people's livelihood cannot be built. Therefore, we must "buy plows" to build the people's livelihood, and at the same time "buy swords" to build national defense. The British Science and Industry Association is discussing "selling swords to buy plows," but we are different from them because we have no swords to sell, and we have never had enough swords to resist the enemy. Therefore, we have suffered greatly in the past. Today, we must not only buy "plows" but also buy "swords." At the same time, we also need to be able to manufacture our own new "plows" and new "swords." Twenty years ago, Mr. Wu Zhihui said that if others use machine guns to attack us, we should use machine guns to fight them back. Even twenty years later, this statement still holds value. In fact, if those who want to attack others with machine guns are not eliminated, this statement will always be valuable. Therefore, I completely agree with Mr. Zhao's national defense theory. Who can guarantee that we will never face a second major test in the future?

The author not only believes that technology is the foundation of industrialization but also pays attention to the importance of organization and management. Obviously, technology requires "efficiency," and organization and management are ways to achieve "high efficiency." However, organization and management are formal, and the most important thing is to lay a psychological foundation. Otherwise, it is merely a machine, not a living organism, only having a passive effect, and not playing an active role. Therefore, in addition to paying attention to "organization" and "management," the author also pays attention to the cultivation of working mood. Regarding this point, the author believes that an excellent technologist, especially in China, needs considerable cultivation in philosophy, literature, art, and even sports. Only then can they obtain a courageous and vigorous, and lively and happy working mood. This kind of working mood is the psychological foundation of "organization" and "management." The theory is elaborated in the articles in the fourth section of the book, which will not be cited here. We certainly know that both science and technology value specialization, but the success of one field of learning often requires the assistance and inspiration of other fields. Therefore, the vertical development and horizontal development of learning are complementary. If a scientist or technologist only focuses on "specialization," the drawback is that their personality becomes biased, their life becomes monotonous. Edison said that 99% of the success of a career is "hard work" and 1% is "inspiration." This tells us that even with 99% of hard work, if we lack 1% of inspiration, we still cannot achieve 100% success. But this "inspiration" can never be nurtured by a boring and monotonous life. Therefore, Mr. Zhao's emphasis on cultivating working mood is indeed profound.

### ### Peace? Or Power?

— Chu Yukun

Peace or Power by H. Butler

Faber and Faber Ltd, London.

Price: Fifteen shillings, totaling 270 pages.

The bloodstains of the First World War have not yet dried, and the crisis of the Third World War is lurking in all parts of the world, with the possibility of breaking out at any time. Therefore, the people of all countries in the world have two urgent questions in their minds: one is how to replace the current "world of power" with a "world of peace"? The other is how to reconcile the conflict between East and West? The solution to these two problems depends on the peace-loving people of the world, using everyone's wisdom to explore the future of the world. Mr. Butler's book "Peace? Or Power?" makes a significant contribution to the solution of these problems. Therefore, it is particularly meaningful to introduce Mr. Butler's masterpiece at this time.

Mr. Butler is a first-class British international commentator. He served as the Director of the International Labor Bureau in Geneva for eighteen years until the League of Nations dissolved in 1938. He then resigned and returned to his country. Therefore, he knows the real situation in European countries more clearly than anyone else. Later, during the Second World War, Mr. Butler was ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to go to the United States and was responsible for intelligence work in the Embassy in the United States. He knows the real situation in all countries of the world, and his footprints have been to Canada, South America, and Asia. Therefore, his international papers are not like theoreticians who speculate with ideals everywhere, but a practical diplomat, a commentator. Every word has a factual basis. Especially this book, which he wrote after returning from a trip to Europe in 1946. In addition, he also wrote "The Lost Peace." He has a unique view that he believes that the conflict between East and West today is not entirely a conflict between communism and democracy. The root cause of the conflict still lies in history. Therefore, he argues that the most important task at present is to make the world fully understand the facts that have happened in the past and understand the facts that are happening now. This proposition deserves our attention. The contents of the book are briefly introduced as follows:

Chapter 1, "The Peace That Failed to Be Made," starts with the establishment of the League of Nations and talks about the process of the outbreak of the Second World War, explaining the international relations within 20 years clearly, and pointing out the reasons for the outbreak of the Second World War.

Chapter 2, "The Cause and Effect of Power," the author witnessed the situation in European countries. Initially, the people of Germany, Italy, Britain, and France did not have the enthusiasm to participate in the war; especially the neutral groups thought that Nazi Germany would definitely abide by international law. Therefore, they believed that their neutrality and peace could be respected, but later they were all invaded by Germany and were involved in the whirlpool of war.

Chapter 3, "East and West," points out that after the collapse of democratic politics in Western countries, anti-democratic ideas in Germany and Italy emerged. The general working class tended to the Soviet Union. Although they did not know the real situation of the Soviet regime, they were skeptical of all the anti-Soviet propaganda from the outside world. If they could choose between fascism and communism, they would rather choose communism.

Chapter 4, "The Hardships of Western European Countries"

Chapter 5, "Germany's Plans," the author believes that the German people are unfortunate. In the recent 30 years, they have encountered two unfortunate disasters. The fundamental reason is that the defeat in 1918 failed to eliminate the German people's warlike mentality. Later, Hitler used nationalism to incite the Germans, which became unstoppable.

Chapter 6, "The Dawn of Eastern Europe," Chapter 7, "The Revival of the Slavs," comprehensively reports on the situation of Eastern European countries after the war. The world has always been unclear about the actual situation of Eastern European countries behind the Iron Curtain. These two chapters are particularly worthy of attention.

Chapter 8. "The Soviet Union in Europe" points out that the Soviet Union has been in a leading position in Europe after the war, and all Eastern European countries follow the Soviet Union's lead; Chapter 9, "The Price Paid by Britain for Victory," Chapter 10, "The Inconsistencies of the British Commonwealth" everywhere express Britain's sadness. Today, Britain can no longer maintain its pre-war status in Europe, and all the traditional relations between Britain and European countries no longer exist. Chapter 11, "The American Long Drive In," the author said that although the Soviet Union's power has penetrated deep into the heart of Europe, overthrowing all the old systems on the European continent, the United States has also bravely driven into Europe, resulting in a conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, making the fate of European countries more subtle and complex.

The last chapter is the conclusion, Peace? Or Power? The author said with great emotion that although the Second World War has become history, peace has not yet been made. In previous international conferences, the East and the West have always failed to reach a compromise. Therefore, the "different purposes and different ideas" of both sides have become more and more exposed, and the conflict between the two sides has changed from secret struggles to open struggles. It is a great misfortune for mankind. (Page 248) Therefore, the world today is still a world of power. The effort to create peace has failed, and the effort to prevent the United Nations from following the footsteps of the League of Nations has also failed. However, people still maintain a belief that an effective international organization is indispensable to preserve modern civilization. Therefore, the struggle between peace and power, who will win and who will lose, is still uncertain today!

### ### Random Notes on the Compilation and Printing of the Shenbao Map

— Zeng Shiying

The Shenbao maps mentioned in this article include the New Map of the Republic of China, the New Provincial Maps of China, etc., all referring to the maps issued by the newspaper. The compilation and printing of these maps can be said to be an attempt in terms of both technology and career at the time. I only knew how to bury myself in technical work, and I did not consider the consequences of things at the beginning. Even the few advanced figures who launched the plan probably did not have full confidence in this map at the beginning, but only tried their best to do it. Now, let me cite a section from the contract for compiling the New Map of the Republic of China:

"...The above maps shall be owned by the publisher for printing and sales, and the price shall be at least four yuan per volume..."

This clause limiting the minimum selling price can have multiple interpretations. At the time, it was expected that sales would not be too high, and there were concerns about careless printing, so there was this gentlemen's agreement. Unexpectedly, the facts were the opposite. Shenbao, based on its publishing experience, set the price of the New Map of the Republic of China at 25 yuan per volume, and even its abridged version, the New Provincial Maps of China, was set at three yuan per volume.

We all know that Shenbao's issuing land is to commemorate its 60th anniversary, and I have always thought so, but recently someone said that among Mr. Ding Zaijun's friends, they saw his economic difficulties after stepping down as the Songhu Governor, and wanted to give him a sum of living expenses, but they also knew that Mr. Zaijun would not take or give anything. If they said they were giving money, they would definitely be rejected. So they came up with a tactful way to ask him to lead the map-making, but he handed over the funds entirely to me for distribution, truly using it for map-making. It is only up to those involved to say whether this legend is credible, but there is such a clause in the contract:

"The publisher shall pay the author 1,000 yuan on the first day of the ninth month of the nineteenth year, and 600 yuan per month thereafter, until the eleventh month of the twentieth year, totaling 10,000 yuan, as the cost of compiling the above maps."

By the eleventh month of the twentieth year, the compilation work had not yet been completed, but the application did not stop the funding because of the contract provisions. Later, we calculated that when the work was completed, there would still be more than 2,000 yuan left, so we automatically notified Shenbao to stop paying the remaining 2,000 yuan, which was also donated to the Geological Society of China. From this point of view, the above legend may not be entirely unfounded.

The success of the Shenbao map cannot but be said to be its unique advantage. The success of a career not only requires opportunity but also requires the leader to be competent and the workers to work hard. Mr. Weng Yongni said in the preface to the New Map of the Republic of China:

"...Mr. Ding Wenjiang created the plan, and the gentlemen of Shenbao helped its success...Most of the reference materials were borrowed from the collections of the Geological Survey Institute's library over the years. I was only involved in assisting from the side..."

The words "assisting from the side" are undoubtedly a humble statement. In fact, he has always been enthusiastic and stood in a guiding position. Many old friends of Mr. Yongni often say that he personally took care of everything, large and small, at the Geological Survey Institute. But when I participated in the compilation of the Shenbao map, in addition to consulting him in advance on the compilation policy, I did not bother him with other technical matters and daily affairs. For example, regarding the expenditure of funds, after the principles were set at the beginning, I did not think that I should report every month, and no one came to inquire. This saved a lot of agency-style reporting work, and all parties were able to free up time to do useful things. But even to this day, when there are academic questions, he still personally guides us, and when he needs to help us, he is happy to write letters or drafts to encourage us.

After the publication of the Shenbao map, it attracted attention from all parties due to the promotion of academic circles at home and abroad, and other publishers began to imitate it. The imitation was not only limited to the content of the map but also to the design of the cover and the name of the atlas. This kind of commercial behavior is not worth mentioning, but there are some that involve academics and cannot be kept silent. I will cite a few examples below:

Topographic layer coloring was originally a method to seek eye-catching on small-scale maps and was rarely used on medium or large-scale maps. However, it was seen on a certain large-scale city map, where the attached hills were colored in layers, making a very simple and clear topographic map look like neither a donkey nor a horse. For another example, there are still no accurate figures for the area of provinces and regions. However, in the description of a certain map read before the war, the area figures cited were all the same as the figures I published in the Shenbao Monthly, and without exception, the last digit was changed. It is an incredible thing that a statistical figure of five or six digits can have the first four or five digits all the same and only differ in the last digit to indicate that there is another origin. Our purpose in compiling the Shenbao map was to promote our views. Therefore, we have always taken a non-interference attitude towards the imitations of other maps, and we hope that someone will cite statistical figures.

Japanese scholar Ogawa Takuji said: Chinese maps have always been compiled by the Japanese and sent to China for printing. However, the "New Map of the Republic of China" was compiled by the Chinese and sent to Japan for printing, which is a progress in cartography in our country. However, we believe it is an insult. Why can't we print it ourselves? Therefore, the New Provincial Maps of China was printed by the Zhonghua Book Company in Shanghai. Later, Mr. Yongni told me that my friend Wu Bannong mentioned that he personally heard former Secretary of the Navy Baker explaining his views on China's progress at a conference in the United States, citing the New Map of the Republic of China as evidence of China's progress. Everyone present was excited, but Professor Kremer, formerly of Shanghai University, pointed out that it was printed by the Japanese, and everyone burst into laughter. Therefore, I initiated the organization of the Chinese Book Publishing Company in the United States two years ago. Later, because the registered name was repeated, it was changed to Huaxia Book Publishing Company. Considering that it is extremely difficult for printing factories to be all-powerful, it was decided to start with map printing first. I hope that it will be entirely done by the Chinese and publish a map that meets international standards. The post-war revised edition of the New Provincial Maps of China published this time was printed by the company's printing factory. Although it is a maiden work, the results are not bad. I hope that they can strive for excellence in map printing and be comparable to the maps printed in Switzerland or Germany.

The theory of the dragon veins winding in Chinese geography has a long history. After the Shenbao map canceled the "pen holder style" representation, the concept of teaching has changed. This cannot but be attributed to the courage to improve geographical teaching. Because the topographic layer coloring method has long been adopted in Europe and the United States, Mr. Zaijun said: "None of us three are geography experts, nor are we middle school teachers, but we understand maps and have surveyed and mapped maps." At that time, we boldly tried this method. There was no table of explanations attached to the map, nor was there a teaching method outside the map. We were afraid that the education field would find it unfamiliar and not adopt it. Unexpectedly, it just suited the taste of the professors.

We are now engaged in the compilation of another new map, which may be another attempt. Mr. Fang Jun of the Geological Society of China will have another explanation. This work is supported by Shenbao's advance payment of royalties to support the staff's salaries and material expenses. But in reality, because the pre-paid royalties will not be calculated for interest in the future, and the currency value is depreciating daily, the value will be negligible after one year. At that time, when I asked Mr. Fang to work with me, it was appropriate that a certain ministry planned to establish a research institute and asked him to preside over it. I advised him that it would be better to do this small thing, at least he could achieve some results. Mr. Fang accepted at that time. Now, the original manuscript of this new map has been completed.

### "Yang Mei Craze"

— Bai Yong

Recently, the Yang Mei affair has caused a great uproar. Moreover, there are Yang Meis in Shanghai, and there are Yang Meis in Ningbo. The Shanghai people's so-called "mass frenzy" is fully demonstrated in this kind of matter. From a scientific point of view, it is certainly worthy of research. However, after so many days of research, what is the result after all? Even if there is a result, can it enable all 400 million Chinese people to practice abstinence from grains and achieve longevity? In today's national crisis, I feel that this is almost a joke. However, rather than saying it is research, it is better to say it is "curiosity."

The "Treatise on the Five Elements" in the Book of Han specializes in recording extraordinary celestial and human changes. Originally, China had the view of unity between heaven and man since ancient times, believing that human affairs could move the heart of heaven, and celestial phenomena were displayed to indicate auspiciousness or misfortune. Therefore, the Spring and Autumn Annals particularly valued solar eclipses and meteorites, considering them to be extraordinary changes. The matters in the "Treatise on the Five Elements" are even more numerous, such as floods, droughts, hailstorms, yellow dragons, auspicious herbs, lingzhi mushrooms, cauldrons appearing, a single birth of three sons, withered trees reviving, and the resurrection of the dead, filling the pages. It can fully represent the ominous yin-yang and five-element thinking of the Han scholars. Perhaps an event like Yang Mei would definitely have been included in the treatise. However, it is truly not easy to determine whether it should be regarded as an auspicious sign or as an evil omen; because if we force it to be interpreted as an auspicious sign, the rice price is rising like this, and the war is so fierce, it seems that it is too inconsistent with reality. If we regard it as an evil omen, we are reluctant to say it! Fortunately, now is not the era of strange yin and yang, everyone is researching, not determining good or bad luck, so there is no need to pursue it.

There is a saying in ancient Chinese poems, "Seeking immortals by taking medicine, often misled by drugs." Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, so wise and decisive, could not avoid feeling the threat of life. He had to send young boys and girls to the Three Immortal Mountains, build dew collecting platforms, and mix elixirs to seize limited life from the hands of creation. This so-called "not eating human food" is the first step to becoming an immortal and ancestor. Unexpectedly, what the ancient sage kings sought but could not obtain, now there is actually such a person. If Zhang Liang were alive, wouldn't he worship her as a teacher? However, facts speak louder than words. The alchemist's elixir ultimately could not seize life. Almost none of the late Tang Dynasty emperors did not die from taking elixirs. Those who admire Yang Mei today, should they unfortunately harbor this kind of delusion, should wake up quickly.

This kind of speculation may be nervous overreaction, let us leave it aside for now. Another motive comes from the failure to solve the problem of people's livelihood. Extending life by eating is something that even today's scientists cannot deny; the rice price is indeed too expensive, and life is really difficult, but the responsibility is not because people's food intake has increased or the number of people eating has increased, but there are other actual reasons. Ningbo, Changzhou, and Chongqing have all experienced rice riots, and everyone is in a state of anxiety. Especially Chongqing, it will never stop rising just because there is a guarantee from Yang Mei's research. Comparing it to the amount of rice that was plundered, Chongqing is even greater and fiercer than other places, isn't this another irony?

Then let me talk about curiosity. Strange people and strange things can indeed make people surprised and bewildered. However, there are too many strange things at the moment. Perhaps it is a common sight, and no one actually regards it as strange. What is this? It is the price of goods that rises every day. Looking through history, has there ever been a stone of rice worth one or several tens of millions, whether in ancient times or today, in China or abroad? Has there ever been a foot of cloth worth millions? The word "million," a few decades ago, was something that we common people would never use. Even if we used it, it was just an adjective. Now, when we hear the news from the market, we just shake our heads and sigh, and we will never exaggerate with such solemnity as when researching Yang Mei. Even if Yang Mei does not eat for nine years, it is only a very small special case, which cannot compare with the madness of this price increase, like sea waves, like storms, which are difficult for anyone to avoid. Therefore, I hope that the authorities do not only want to hear strange things, but rather study the price and size of sesame cakes and fried dough sticks more, and plan more for the resettlement and relief of refugees, which is really more useful than focusing their energy on this one thing. Moreover, there is a lesson that we should particularly remember, which is the story of Shandong Dang Hao Liang deceiving our Executive Yuan President before the War of Resistance. In these years, we cannot completely judge the hearts of small people with the belly of a gentleman—although we may not be that much of a gentleman either. If you don't believe me, look at the Yang Mei in Shanghai, isn't she already seen at the beginning but not at the end?

### Raising Goldfish Indoors

— Wu Jiren

Among the tanks for raising goldfish indoors, those produced in Yixing are the best. However, since the War of Resistance against Japan, I have repeatedly asked friends to inquire, and it is said that Yixing has no new goods on the market. Alternatively, wooden buckets can also be used. Raising fish in wooden buckets is popular in Tianjin and Beijing. What must be noted is that the mouth should be wide and spacious, and sufficient sunlight is required. Other porcelain tanks, all those with a wide mouth and a flat bottom, are acceptable. For indoor fish keeping, large glass tanks can only be used for a short period of time.

The frequency of adding and changing water depends on the water quality and weather. If the fish do not come to the surface to spit bubbles and can stay peacefully at the bottom of the tank, there is no need to change the water. Changing the water too frequently can cause white spots to appear on the fish's body, which means they are getting sick.

Regarding how many fish can be placed in a tank, here is a ratio: for every four to six fish that are one inch long, they can be raised in a tank that is one foot in diameter. Exceeding this ratio will result in insufficient nutrients in the water, and the fish will float to the surface restlessly, requiring either a water change or a division into separate tanks.

Feeding is most suitable in the early morning. It should only be given once a day, and it is best if they eat all the live water fleas within an hour after feeding. If too much is given and they cannot finish eating it, it must be removed by any means two hours after feeding, because in spring, autumn, and winter, it is not a big problem to give too much food that they cannot finish eating. However, in summer, water fleas easily die, the water easily becomes smelly, and the fish cannot withstand it. Fish deaths due to water spoilage are common. As for water fleas, if they are sometimes difficult to find, they can be replaced with rice porridge, but the greasy liquid in the rice porridge must first be removed before putting it in. They also love to eat other things, such as algae (commonly known as foxtail grass), but it should also be given in small amounts.

Well water, tap water, and rainwater can all be used to raise fish, as long as they are clean, not smelly, and contain oxygen.

### A Day in a Small Town

— Ji Mo

People who are tired of the city often long for the joys of rural life. A quiet environment and a simple life can greatly soothe tense nerves. With such a mindset, I took advantage of a weekend holiday and spent a day in my hometown, Town M.

Town M is located in a scenic area. There, spotless temples, dishes made with excellent ingredients and cooking skills, and jujube paste sesame cakes that are not greasy to chew (said to be made best by a confectionery shop called Gan Shengyuan at the end of the inclined bridge, which has been open for the longest time) are all very famous. I knew all of this very well. However, I accepted the kindness of Mr. Yang, a carpenter who had recently repaired my house, and stayed at his home for a short time.

Mr. Yang's residence is his own property. Passing through the wall gate painted with black powder is a small courtyard, followed by three main rooms. Behind it is another courtyard made of cement. After that, there is also a garden, and pushing out a back door from the garden leads to a large garden that serves multiple purposes.

In one corner of the large garden, there is a clump of bamboo, covered under a semicircular shade surrounded by stone railings. The pool reflects the heavy greenery. It is said that before Mr. Yang bought this house, ghosts in mandarin sleeves would appear in the garden at night from time to time. Reason tells me that this is not the case, but the speaker's earnestness makes me half believe and half doubt.

In another corner of the garden, there are three sheep in a wooden fence, bleating at people. I wanted to find some weeds on the ground to feed them, but the ground was only covered with wild motherwort plants with white flowers. It is said that this has a bitter taste, and when sugar is added after boiling, it is commonly known as "bitter herb soup." But when I walked to the sheep, they ate it with relish.

I then walked to the back of the large garden and opened the back door. It was a field of crisscrossing paths. It was said to belong to the "warehouse" that specializes in collecting rent rice. A farmer in short clothes, rolled up his pants, and was walking in the mud that was knee-deep in water, driving a sturdy ox to plow the field. It is said that people without farming experience cannot move once their legs are submerged in the mud.

The surface of Town M is as calm, peaceful, and simple as in the past. However, the fluctuations in prices have also stirred up considerable waves in people's hearts. Rice with a limited price of ten million yuan is only some yellow rough rice, but pork is surprisingly cheap, selling for only two hundred thousand yuan per catty, which is more than one-third cheaper than in Shanghai. There are several reasons for this. First, the farmers' grains and wheat have all been sold out in the past few days, and they are waiting to use the money, so they have to sell it painfully. Second, bean cakes and other pig feed, which are used to feed pigs, have risen a lot, and some pig farmers are suffering from the burden and have to slaughter them early.

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

A person who does not give others a little happiness all day long will inevitably have no happiness himself.

The fallen red petals floating on the water envy the withered flowers falling in the mud, and the withered flowers in the mud envy the petals in the wind.

A person should preferably have two fans: a beautiful goose feather fan with an ivory handle, used in the midst of fragrant clothes and graceful shadows; and a large banana leaf fan, which is also indispensable at home.

Isn't "90% new" just "10% old"?

A glass diamond ring worth 150,000 yuan will also be priceless as long as it is worn on the slender hand of a noble lady.

### Conjuring Trick

— Pingzhai

"When poverty strikes, change is needed" has been heard countless times. Let's see how to "change" things.

"Change" is a directed action. Therefore, changing for the better can break the "poverty" situation, as the saying goes, "change brings success"; otherwise, if you don't touch the root of "poverty" and change the pattern randomly, the result will only be to expose your weaknesses.

For example, when rice prices soared, the authorities took the measure of selling off reserves. This is from no control to control. Following it with price limits is naturally also unquestionable. Then, probably because the rice market was too stable, the price limit was cancelled again, another change. Coincidentally, as soon as the price limit was cancelled, there was a big price increase, rising to seven million, eight million, nine million, and ten million, and then they wanted to limit the price again, to limit it to ten million, another change. In less than a week, they suddenly said they didn't want to limit the price again. The result was that the price limit on white rice was cancelled, and there was a price limit on indica rice, another change—but there was one characteristic in this change, the quality of rice may be different, but the price limit was still ten million.

It can be said that they are good at changing, but the rice price responds to all changes with "no change." No matter what tricks you play, it always: rises!

Changing it again, the price limit on indica rice can also be cancelled. At that time, in order to "reduce the living burden of the majority of consumers in this city," should we implement price limits on corn and price limits on tree bark and grass roots?

"Changing" back and forth, how can this kind of "trick" only deceive children!

### On General Shou Sa Ding's 90th Birthday Inscription

— Ye Gongchuo

The reputation of Yanmen has always been unparalleled, and I am amazed by the newness of the years. He is happy to help others as if it were his own business, and his enthusiasm for reconciliation does not depend on others. The hills and valleys in his heart can become history, and the smoke at the bottom of his wrist seems to have a spirit. Ashamed of my short wings, I look up to the old pine in the frost from afar.

### Harmonious Work

— Sa Zhenbing

Mr. Shilinhao's virtue is extraordinary, and the letters convey new ideas. He lies in the south of heaven, nourishing his virtue, and silently observes the current situation, cherishing the people alone. The friendship between the two worlds is as deep as the sea, and the poetic thoughts are wonderfully divine in his life. The strings and bamboo are not old in Dongshan, and I wish you to take care of your old age.

Since the late Qing Dynasty accepted the civilization of the times and greatly opened up the social atmosphere, the newspaper industry gradually flourished, and in the early years of the Republic of China, it developed at an accelerated pace. There was a slogan called "record everything heard," which had no correct basis, but people repeated it, and the consensus became a monument, as strict as a creed. In the last two or thirty years, the newspaper industry has made progress, and journalism scholars have carefully studied and compiled experts from China and abroad to establish an accurate definition of "news" and changed "record everything heard" to "observe everything heard," hearing a piece of news, you must investigate its details and truth as much as possible. When there is "news value", it becomes "news". This has now become extremely common knowledge, but at that time, literati presided over newspapers, and everything was at a loss, with most people groping in the dark. In the early stages, it is no wonder that there was a lot of muddling through.

The "record everything heard" that the newspaper industry believed in at that time, some people said that the "reporting of hearsay" of the old imperial censors could be cited as an example, but in reality, it seemed right but was not.

The censors were called "speaking officials" and also called "the ears and eyes of the court." Regarding the corruption and illegal behavior of officials inside and outside the government, they could impeach them as soon as they heard about it. The court would send senior officials to investigate, and if it was verified, the impeached person would be punished. If the report was completely false, close to catching shadows, the impeached person was innocent, and the impeacher was also innocent, unless the censor had prior bribery or held a memorial to extort money, the dereliction of duty was punished according to the rules, not because he spoke untruthfully. (Censors were occasionally punished for using excessive or disrespectful wording, which was a special case, an exception).

The duty of a news reporter is to establish words, the so-called "public opinion," which is similar to the so-called "pure discussion" of that year. Therefore, in a certain position, it is quite similar to the speaking officials of that year. Even if the words of the speaking officials were untrue, they were not considered a crime, one is because impeachment was their duty, and the second is that their "words" were only reference materials, which had to be investigated and reported by other parties to determine right and wrong, and were not immediately regarded as the final conclusion. News reporters are also like this, criticism should be as objective as possible, and records should be as accurate as possible. Naturally, it would be best, even if some have insufficient knowledge and are emotional, there are excessive words about current affairs and important people (like the former censors' memorials, often wantonly criticized, making the impeached senior officials feel unbearably humiliated), as long as the conscience is clear and there is no other motive, there is no private crime (that is, dereliction of duty). The difference is that the censors' memorials were sent directly to the "inner court," and the investigation and reply memorials sent by the inner court and the imperial edicts clearly announced whether it was right or wrong, true or false, and were only published in the so-called yellow-skinned Beijing News, which was poorly printed, and the dry documents were only purchased and read by a few officials, and were not popularized among the gentry and people. Therefore, even if the circumstances of the impeachment were false, the reputation of the person concerned had no great impact on society. Modern newspapers are different. They are not reading material for a few officials, but are aimed at a wide range of readers in society, and once they are slandered, the impression has been spread, and the loss exceeds the appearance. Therefore, "record everything heard" cannot be compared with the "reporting of hearsay" of the speaking officials and cannot be cited as an example. (At that time, there was also a popular saying that "if the record is false, it can be corrected," which is certainly a method. But the ancient lesson of "like dyeing oneself black" must also be known.)
