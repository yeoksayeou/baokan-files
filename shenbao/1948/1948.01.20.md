### Meeting Between British Ambassador and Foreign Minister: Kowloon City Case Shows Signs of Progress; Hong Kong's Second Eviction Order Not Implemented

[Our Nanjing dispatch, 19th] After two days of quiet Sino-British negotiations in the capital, activities resumed on the 19th. British Ambassador Sir Ralph Stevenson visited Foreign Minister Wang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:00 AM for approximately one hour to discuss the Kowloon City issue and the Shamian incident in Guangzhou. The British Ambassador presented some materials and opinions, but nothing concrete has been decided yet. The outcome of the talks is unknown. However, both sides maintained a very friendly attitude and were sincere in their efforts to prevent the disputes from continuing and to seek a prompt resolution. According to our reporter's investigation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any warning from the Kowloon side as of late evening, suggesting that the Hong Kong authorities' plan to forcibly relocate residents on the 19th was not implemented. It is believed that instructions from London may have reached the Hong Kong government, leading to the timely halt of these forced actions. The deadline of the 19th, which had been regarded as a "death sentence" by all parties, was thus eased. An official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told our reporter that reports from various parties in Guangzhou regarding the incident were still arriving at the Ministry, and the Ministry had instructed Special Commissioner Guo Dewa on various issues via telegram. Reliable sources indicate that regarding the Kowloon City issue, opinions from negotiations in London and Hong Kong are gradually converging. The ultimate solution will take into account both the current situation and the legal basis, and a new development is expected in the short term. As for the Shamian incident in Guangzhou, the British Embassy has not yet received instructions from the British government, and no clear stance has been expressed. Concerned parties believe that the meeting between the British Ambassador and Foreign Minister Wang on the 19th indicates a greater opportunity for resolving the issues. The Shamian incident has not affected negotiations on the Kowloon City issue, and a resolution to the Kowloon City issue will benefit the aftermath of the Shamian incident, restoring stability to the uneasy situation of recent months. [Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Our reporter learned from authoritative sources that our government had made a formal protest to the British side regarding the Hong Kong government's repeated forced relocation of Kowloon City residents. The British side would not likely ignore this protest. It is also said that Foreign Ministry Special Commissioner Guo Dewa has made necessary explanations to the Kowloon City residents.

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 19th] The Kowloon City issue has not yet been resolved, but well-informed sources are optimistic that senior officials are willing to reach a settlement agreement on this matter soon. The result may be a temporary maintenance of the status quo regarding jurisdiction over the old city of Kowloon, leaving it for future discussions. Inevitably, future discussions will involve the future status of Hong Kong and Kowloon as a whole. At the same time, the residents of the old city of Kowloon are still staying in their original places and have not retreated. The police guarding the area have not interfered, and the police have not interfered with the temporary shelters built by the residents. As for the two resident representatives sentenced to three months of hard labor, they have not yet filed an appeal.

[Our Guangzhou dispatch, 19th] 250 British soldiers suddenly entered Kowloon City at 4:30 AM on the 19th. It is rumored that they were preparing to forcibly relocate the residents of Kowloon City on a large scale, but there had been no action as of 9:00 AM. The residents continued to raise the flag as usual. They stared at the fluttering national flag, to the point of tears. Their grief and indignation can be imagined. In addition, both sides have deployed heavy troops to guard the Guangdong-Hong Kong border to prevent accidents. On the night of the 17th, a group of unstable elements attempted to enter Shenzhen from the Hong Kong side, but they fled after being thwarted by the strict vigilance of the national army. The sudden large-scale increase in British troop deployments to the border at this time has made the situation very tense. Those entering Hong Kong from Guangdong are now subject to strict inspection by the British army.

### Shamian Incident Suspects: Over Seventy Released

Inaccurate Claim that Youth League Members Prevented Firefighting [Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 19th] Of the hundred or more suspects arrested during the Shamian incident, one-third were students. All of them were handed over to the Garrison Headquarters on the night of the 16th. Since the headquarters did not have detention facilities, they were detained in VIP rooms. They were interrogated separately on the morning of the 17th, and those without evidence of guilt were immediately released on bail. More than 20 people were released on the afternoon of the 17th, and more than 50 people were released on the 18th. It is understood that those whose cases are more serious and require detailed investigation will be released successively as quickly as possible.

[Another dispatch] According to a United Press dispatch on the 17th, some members of the Three People's Principles Youth League wearing uniforms prevented the fire brigade from fighting the fire during the Shamian incident. Guan Zishu, the former director of the Three People's Principles Youth League and the current deputy director of the Provincial Party Headquarters, said that the demolition of houses in Kowloon City and the burning of consulates in Shamian were both unfortunate incidents and regrettable. In particular, it is a pity that the patriotic actions of the Guangzhou people's demonstrations and parades were turned into excessive actions due to the infiltration of conspirators. As for the report that youth league members wearing uniforms prevented the fire brigade from fighting the fire, it is absurd. There has never been a regulation for youth league members to wear uniforms, and since the unification of the party and the league organization, the name of league member has no longer been used externally, and there is no such thing as league members preventing the fire brigade from fighting the fire. This kind of dispatch does not conform to the facts.

### Presidential Election Procedures: Draft Still Under Discussion; National Assembly Preparatory Committee Intensifies Work

[Our Nanjing dispatch, 19th] The work of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee is actively underway. Secretary-General Hong Lan You and others frequently visit the office to prepare for the National Assembly delegates' reception center and the documents required for the registration of each delegate. It is learned that more than ten regulations drafted by the National Assembly Preparatory Committee's second meeting and handed over to the Committee's agenda group have now been completed in their first draft. After passing through the Secretariat's office meeting and then through the Preparatory Committee, they can be finalized. According to a certain person in charge of drafting the documents, the drafting of more than ten kinds of laws and regulations can be explained: regarding the draft election method of the presidium, the rules of procedure, and the format of the National Assembly delegates' oath, there are precedents to follow, and the drafting is easier. However, the presidential and vice-presidential election procedures are unprecedented in our country, so the codes of various democratic countries have been consulted, and the opinions of experts have been solicited to complete the draft. The person continued: In order to draft this chapter, I had previously helped Ambassador Stuart Layton to borrow the American code for reference, but I knew that each democratic country had implemented it for a long time and had customary law, so it was not possible to obtain a good reference for a while. The person also said: It needs to be studied by experts before a decision can be made. The Preparatory Committee attaches great importance to this matter.

[Another dispatch] The reason why the list of elected National Assembly delegates has not been announced is that the issue of mutual concessions among Kuomintang members and the disputes arising from the nomination of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party without being elected have not been resolved. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is deeply concerned about this. On the 19th, after the National Father's Memorial Week at the Central Party Headquarters, he summoned Wu Tiecheng to demolish the houses. In addition, the Democratic Socialist Party has sent a special letter to Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Lisheng, and Chen Lifu of the Kuomintang regarding the failure of some party members to be elected, requesting that a joint meeting of the three parties be convened immediately for swift discussion to resolve the issue as soon as possible. [Another dispatch] Forty representatives of the Kuomintang Central Nominated National Assembly Delegates Association went to the Central Party Headquarters on the morning of the 19th to request an audience with President Chiang Kai-shek. They were received by Secretary-General Wu, who said that the National Assembly issue had not been finally decided and that a solution was being studied. During the representatives' petition, they held a white cloth banner with the words "Requesting the implementation of the President's and the Central Committee's orders and the implementation of the National Government's resolutions." It is reported that the association has decided that if the central government does not report its orders and regulations, it will immediately notify members in various provinces and cities to gather in Nanjing before March 10 to attend the National Assembly.

### Election of Legislators: Strict Prevention of Fraud

The Jiangsu Election Office Orders All Districts to Comply [Our Zhenjiang dispatch, 19th] Wang Maogong, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Election Office, noted that as the election of legislators has begun, there have been reports of soliciting money under false pretenses. He stated that at the beginning of the implementation of the current constitution, it is the beginning of democratic progress. If uprightness is not upheld, how can the virtuous and capable be elected? He has repeatedly ordered strict rectification from the National Government. All personnel responsible for election affairs must pay close attention at all times, curb corruption, and save the declining customs. The future of election administration depends on this. The office has recently issued special orders to the election offices in various districts to comply. [Our Zhenjiang dispatch, 19th] Today is only one day away from the date of the Jiangsu Province press circles' vote for legislators. According to reports from various counties, Chen Xunchun and Cheng Cangbo, who are campaigning in this province, have already obtained the unanimous support of their colleagues throughout the province. Others, such as Huang Shaogu, Hu Jianzhong, and Chen Bosheng, are also expected to receive a considerable number of votes. The campaign grounds of the press circles in Zhenjiang and Wuxi are full of an atmosphere of friendship and harmony, which is a microcosm of the new China.

[Our Dongtai dispatch, 19th] On the eve of the legislative election, campaign activities here have intensified. Red paper slogans are everywhere on the streets. Zhu Shiqiu and Yu Yifan are the two with higher voices. In addition, the members of the local reporters' association unanimously support Chen Xuncun.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 18th] As the legislative election approaches, the candidates in Tianjin have launched a more heated campaign than on the eve of the National Assembly election. The campaign teams of various candidates have been established one after another. Portraits, giant slogans, cartoons, and biographies of the candidates can be seen everywhere on the streets. There are also many who use cars for roving lectures. Guo Zijun, Wang Renyuan, Xu Yunxi, Li Huilin, Zhai Shaohua, and Qi Guoliang are the most active campaigners. Zhou Zhihou, the candidate nominated by the Democratic Socialist Party, has also plastered campaign slogans all over the city. [Central News Agency, Xi'an, 19th] The legislative election campaign here has been launched fiercely and has entered a white-hot stage. The candidates are vying for votes even more enthusiastically than during the last National Assembly election. Campaign slogans have also appeared on the streets.

### National Government Legal System Committee: Discusses Self-Government Guidelines; No Concrete Conclusion Reached on the Issue of Popularly Elected Provincial and County Heads

[Our Nanjing dispatch, 19th] The National Government Committee's Legal System Committee held a meeting at 4:00 PM on the 19th, chaired by Sun Ke, to discuss the provincial and county self-government guidelines. There were two opinions during the meeting. Some people believed that it would not be easy to realize the popular election of provincial and county heads in China, which is currently in the midst of turmoil and military operations, and should be postponed. Others believed that since the president can be elected, the provincial and county heads can certainly be elected. Sun Ke strongly supported this view, believing that popular elections should begin as scheduled. Xu Chuanlin said: Even if it cannot be implemented immediately, it must be completed within a time limit. Zhang Qun believes that the popular election should be carried out only after the provincial areas are reduced. The meeting was very enthusiastic, but no concrete conclusions were reached.

### Zhang Jia'ao Banquets North China Petition Delegation; Northbound Grain Transportation to Increase; Reopening Shanghai Exchange for Industrial Loans No Problem in Principle

[Our Nanjing dispatch, 19th] The North China Petition Delegation and his party visited Wu Yuchang, Secretary-General of the National Government, at 11:00 AM on the 19th to present their petition to the National Government and discuss general matters. Wu promised to report their requests to the President and forward them to the relevant agencies for review. The delegation had lunch with Zhang Jia'ao, and all issues were discussed. The amount of grain transported to the north in principle will be increased, and it is estimated that the total amount of flour for Peiping and Tianjin will be increased to 1.25 million bags. However, this amount is still insufficient, and the Ministry of Food cannot immediately bear the burden. The Shanghai exchange may be opened to suppress the prices of daily necessities in the north. There is no problem in principle with restoring industrial loans, and they may be issued in the form of orders. However, the government cannot place orders for some small industries such as telegrams and glass, and other methods must be considered. The period of mortgage may be extended, and the collateral may be expanded to include factory buildings and machinery. As for the foreign exchange issue, which they discussed with Zhang for the longest time, since it involves the entire policy, no conclusion could be reached. It was only possible to increase the input of foreign exchange. The method of exporting foreign exchange and exporting grain in exchange for foreign exchange was difficult to obtain approval. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, they went to visit Zhang Qun, the President of the Executive Yuan. Zhang agreed to help in principle, but there were no concrete results. The conversation also involved the issue of returning the Mentougou coal mine. In the morning of the 20th, they will visit the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Four Joint Offices. In the afternoon, they will study the surplus and shortage of grain in the north and south with the Ministry of Food to determine the allocation method. They may attend the regular meeting of the National Economic Council on the 22nd to report, but this will not affect the meeting of the heads of the relevant ministries and commissions that President Zhang had previously decided to convene. When the problem is largely resolved, they will visit the President again to complete all the work.

### Control Yuan Recommends That National Government Pay Attention to North China's Economy

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Control Yuan held a discussion meeting of Control Committee members at 9:00 AM on the 19th, chaired by Wang Bijiang. Control Committee member Yu Shude proposed to make a representation based on the statements of the North China Delegation to the Capital. Because North China's military situation is urgent, the people of the country are all concerned, but the economic crisis is even more serious than the military, and it is often overlooked. Many of the Central Government's measures on North China's economy are inappropriate, further promoting the imbalance of North China's economy. The impact on the military is very serious and huge. A unanimous decision was made to ask the Control Yuan to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the departments in charge to find out what happened in order to review and handle it. It is also recommended that the National Government instruct the departments in charge of economic measures in North China to earnestly improve the measures by referring to the opinions submitted by the delegation.

### Issue of Opening Loans: To Be Submitted to the Plenary Session for Decision After Drafting Detailed Plans

[Our Nanjing dispatch, 19th] Authoritative sources reveal that Wu Yun Chu and others from Shanghai's industrial circles have requested the opening of loans. The Four Joint Offices are seeking the opinions of various banks for research. As of now, government decision-makers in charge of finance and economy still have two views on the opening of loans. One faction advocates opening, and the other faction opposes it. However, the previous suspension of loans was ordered by President Chiang Kai-shek, so whether to open it in the future depends on the detailed plans being drafted and submitted to President Chiang Kai-shek for a final decision.

### Yu Dawei Suspends Trip to United States

[News from our newspaper] According to our city's English-language newspaper, the Greater Shanghai Evening Post, authoritative sources in Nanjing said that the Chinese government's efforts to obtain US aid months ago prioritized economy and finance. The US State Department has repeatedly hinted that it will not discuss the issue of military aid to China for the time being. Economic aid is already being discussed between 　　　Yiyuan and Runzhi. The trip to the United States by Minister of Transportation 　 Tianwei has been decided to be cancelled.

### National Army Launches Suppression War in Xiaozhan and Other Places South of Tianjin, Both Sides of Beining Railway; Communist Bandit Remnants Flee, National Army Engages

[Our Tianjin dispatch, 19th] The National Army south of Tianjin launched a suppression operation in the Xiaozhan area at dawn on the 19th. By 2:00 PM, Xiaozhan, West Xiaozhan, Zhongtang, Chaozongqiao, and other places had been recovered one after another. The communist bandits' 20th and 21st Regiments had all fled south.

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 19th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters announced that in order to ensure the safety of traffic on the Beining Railway, the National Army had dispatched powerful troops to launch a suppression operation on both sides of the railway. On the 16th, they found more than 2,000 main forces of the Communist Bandit's 11th Brigade in the areas of Shangxia Xinzhuang, Pangguanying, and Fanwangzhuang, 10 kilometers north of Liushouying, and dealt them a heavy blow. After a fierce battle for half a day, more than 300 communist bandits were killed, and the remnant bandits fled to the northwest. Another National Army unit encountered more than 600 communist bandits in Fangezhuang Qililun, about 5 kilometers north of Zhangjiazhuang (south of Changli), and launched a battle. More than 100 communist bandits were killed or wounded, and the remnant bandits retreated to the north. The National Army is still continuing the suppression operation. [Our Baoding dispatch, 19th] The communist bandits who had gathered in the Dawangdian area of Mancheng began to flee east this morning to harass the area. At 6:00 PM, more than 4,000 troops from the 18th Brigade of the Communist 6th Column had arrived in the areas of Zhonglianliang and Yangcun, 15 li northwest of Baoding. The mobile troops of the National Army stationed in Baoding went to engage them, and a fierce battle began at 7:00 PM. In addition, a unit of communist bandits also infiltrated the Qianhe area north of Baoding. This morning, a northbound car encountered the bandits on the south bank of the Caohe River and had a small contact. The car returned to Baoding.

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 19th] The powerful National Army troops that had penetrated deep into the border area of Hebei, Rehe, and Chahar not only completely defeated the seven regiments of Zhan's army but also thoroughly destroyed the communist bandits' old nest of Sihaiye, Ningdong, and Yongning in the northwest. They also transferred their forces to continue the suppression operation. Sihaiye was the old base area that the communist bandits had operated for 12 years. The communist bandits' military district headquarters and commissioner's office were located there. The destruction of the area was a great blow to the communist bandits. (News of the battle against the bandits in the Dabie Mountains is published in the left corner of page two.)

### Entire Bandit Suppression Work Can Be Completed in Three Years: Deng Wenyi Receives Reporters in Peiping

[Our Peiping dispatch, 19th] Deng Wenyi received reporters on the 19th to review the gains and losses of the National Army's operations last year and to look forward to the future. Deng said: 80-90% of the 600,000 communist bandits within the pass can be eliminated within a year, and the entire bandit suppression work can be completed in three years. The development of the communist bandits' strength reached its peak last year and is now beginning to decline. The National Army must actively pursue and suppress them in the future and strengthen its political strength. The effects will be seen in three months. Fear and pessimism must be eliminated. The claim that the Northeast will be abandoned is absolutely untrue. Large army groups are being transferred to the north. Deng continued: In the 60 operations last year, 82 important battles were fought. Before October, an average of 3-5 battles were fought per month, and then it became more intense, with an average of 10-19 battles. The communist bandits' strength is currently about 1.1 million, 450,000 outside the pass, and 600,000 inside the pass. Last year, they lost nearly 800,000, but they have been replenished at any time. The loss of veteran cadres and soldiers is about 70%. Their shortcomings are the lack of veteran cadres and training, and their equipment is even worse. About one-quarter of the country's counties and cities are controlled by bandits, with a population of nearly 100 million, but 14 million have been forced to flee. The National Army's donations last year were about 400,000. Strategically, they were completely victorious.

### Chen Cheng Solemnly Declares That Jilin and Changchun Will Never Be Abandoned

### Total Budget for the First Half of This Year: Report of the Review by the Council of State Affairs Standing Committee; Suggestions for the Government to Implement Three Basic Reforms

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Council of State Affairs Standing Committee has completed its review of the draft total budget for central government revenues and expenditures for the first half of the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1948] on the 16th. It has passed the review report, which has been submitted to the Secretariat of the Council for finalization and will be sent directly to the government. The full text of the review report is as follows:

Having examined the central government's total budget and special budget for revenues and expenditures for the first half of the 37th year, the Committee has convened multiple special meetings of the Standing Committee for detailed review. It believes that given the national situation of depleted tax revenues, enormous expenditures, and the further amplification of these enormous expenditures due to soaring prices, it is impossible to create a realistic and accurate budget. This Committee deeply understands the current difficulties of the nation, and therefore does not intend to nitpick on any ordinary or special sections of the government's budget for the first half of the 37th year, nor does it intend to reduce its expenditure figures. This is entirely a matter of austerity, and is unrelated to averting the serious crisis of a potential total political and economic collapse in the future.

This Committee believes that sound national policies are based on a sound national budget. Upon reviewing the contents of this budget, it is evident that the proportion of active expenditures on production, construction, and the development of science and education is extremely small, while the proportion of passive expenditures on military expenses, general salaries, and administrative costs is extremely large. This shows that current policies are merely patching up deficiencies in an attempt to maintain the status quo, which will inevitably lead to a daily shrinking of production and a daily increase in expenditure. It is feared that the status quo may become unsustainable one day, which is truly alarming.

This Committee believes that the government must make a painful decision and implement the following basic reforms in order to avoid a potential total political and economic collapse in the future:

### Implement Streamlined Troops and Eliminate Military Malpractices

Implement streamlined troops and eliminate military malpractices. The government has been compelled to quell the rebellion by force, resulting in enormous expenditures and a difficult-to-balance budget, which should be understood by the people. However, given that the National Army has superior weapons, several times the number of soldiers, and the assistance of a heroic air force, why is it unable to quickly defeat the rebel army? This may be due to excessive military malpractices. The biggest military malpractice now is "eating empty pay." According to the budget, the number of officers and soldiers is five million. The strength appears to be far away from the objective. If there are not many vacant positions, why is it so? As a result, it not only wastes national funds but also corrupts military discipline and discourages the fighting spirit of officers and soldiers. If the commanders in the military are very wealthy and seek illegal profits, then those below will follow suit. This army will inevitably become corrupt and unable to fight. Secondly, the military organizations, from the Ministry of National Defense downwards, are so large that the number of non-combatants, such as adjutants, messengers, and guards, is high. Even after the establishment of the Ministry of National Defense and several reforms, the waste of manpower and financial resources has not been eliminated, which is regrettable. Today, the government must implement the doctrine of elite troops and thoroughly eliminate all malpractices in the military so that the suppression of the rebellion can be successful as soon as possible and the budget can be easily balanced.

### Reform the Currency System Promptly to Stop Soaring Prices

Reform the currency system promptly to stop soaring prices. The huge budget is closely related to rising prices. If prices continue to soar in the future, then the budget, which is now considered huge, will be even more so. Therefore, stopping the rise in prices is a necessary condition for stabilizing the budget. Efforts should be made in many aspects to stop the rise in prices, but reducing currency circulation and stabilizing currency value are particularly urgent. It is not easy to reduce currency circulation today, so the only option is to reform the monetary system to stabilize the currency value. Therefore, this Committee hopes that the government will immediately take effective preparations and steps to quickly realize this goal in order to solve the current dangerous cycle of currency inflation and price increases stimulating each other, so that people's livelihood can be slightly stabilized.

### Thoroughly Reform Internal Affairs to Expand the Financial Base

Thoroughly reform internal affairs to expand the financial base. Since the budget is so huge and the deficit accounts for 39% of the total budget, it cannot be filled solely by saving money and eliminating private gains and waste. It must rely on borrowing domestic and foreign debts. The draft special budget already lists debt as a revenue item, indicating that it will use loans to make up for the deficit. The people of our country are patriotic, and friendly countries in the world are willing to assist China's recovery with economic power, but many are hesitant due to our low administrative efficiency and corrupt bureaucracy. This Committee believes that our country is in a serious situation. If we want to gain the trust of the people in government-issued bonds and the early success of loans from friendly countries, we must thoroughly reform internal affairs. We sincerely hope that the government will take the opinions of those at home and abroad who oppose and criticize the government as a warning, sincerely accept them, sincerely implement democracy, and sincerely eliminate all malpractices in politics. Then the people will actively purchase bonds, and loans from friendly countries will come without being asked.

### The Government Should Pay Attention to Science, Culture, and Economy

In addition, there is one more thing that must be brought to the attention of the government. This year has already begun to implement the Constitution, and Article 164 of the Constitution stipulates that "the expenditure on education, science, and culture shall not be less than 15% of the total amount of its budget at the central level..." The ordinary part of this budget alone is less than this number. If the special part is included, the difference will be even greater.

Finally, this Committee has repeatedly stated in recent years that in the current situation of increasing inequality in wealth, it advocates equal burden-sharing and levying special donations on the super-rich. Now that the budget's revenue has reached the point of exhaustion, the government should make a decision to implement an excessive profit tax. We believe that political power should be used to requisition the property of wealthy Chinese citizens and their funds deposited abroad, which should be used to fill the deficit and overcome the unprecedented difficulties.

### Kuomintang Central Committee Memorial Week: Xu Kan Reports on Budget Situation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] Xu Kan, Director of the National Government's Directorate General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics, reported at the Kuomintang Central Committee Memorial Week meeting on the morning of the 19th that the total budget for the first half of this year is over 9.6 trillion, but various tax revenues have also increased. The total tax revenue and income from handling materials reached over 5.8 trillion, accounting for 61% of the total revenue. The difference between income and expenditure is 39%. The government is planning to raise special donations and seek assistance from abroad to remedy the situation so that it will not rely on issuing funds for expenditure as in the past. He also stated that the largest expenditure this year is on living allowances for civil servants, which is a special phenomenon under the condition of high prices. As long as the suppression of the rebellion is completed, the expenditure on special departments can be reduced. Xu also pointed out that only by stabilizing the currency value and stabilizing prices can the current political and economic crisis be reversed.

### From American Aid Flour to Mastering Materials

Yesterday afternoon, the acceptance ceremony for the first batch of American aid relief supplies was held at the First Wharf Reception Center of the China Merchants Bureau in this city. This was a very meaningful event. What China accepted yesterday was 8,000 tons of relief flour. Although this is only a small part of American aid materials, in this time of food panic, the Chinese government, with the continuous assistance from the United States, can begin to implement the universal distribution of civilian food in the five major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beiping, and Guangzhou, in order to achieve the goal of stabilizing food prices, and then use the proceeds from the distribution of materials to purchase other relief supplies, which will be widely distributed to the people in urgent need of relief throughout the country. This has opened a new page in the history of Sino-American relations. Such timely and effective assistance from the United States to China can be truly said to be a friend in need. The Chinese people, especially the citizens of Shanghai who first accepted this batch of flour, must all express their heartfelt gratitude.

In this regard, we can prove that the banners with unsightly slogans written on them by students who marched in this city on the 17th to protest the Kowloon incident must have been the work of some people with ulterior motives and not the public opinion of the general good citizens. In everything in the world, we should think calmly and quietly. The behavior of "returning evil for good" will be despised by the people of a great country.

Today, this newspaper does not want to talk much about how we should thank our American allies for their kindness, but would like to talk about how we should master materials and how to use those mastered materials to reduce or eliminate economic difficulties in the future, starting from the arrival of American aid materials.

The discussion of mastering materials did not begin today. Since the War of Resistance, due to the urgent needs of the military, the obstruction of overseas sources, the destruction of production enterprises in various places, and the obstruction of land and water transportation, the concept of valuing materials over currency has inadvertently deepened in people's hearts. People have stored up in various ways to prepare for emergencies, so as to reside in, and to protect currency values. The country has also spared no effort to purchase and collect goods in order to accumulate reserves and facilitate use. It has been more than two years since the restoration, but currency and other issues have not been resolved smoothly, so the theory of mastering materials and grasping materials is still a consistent policy of the authorities today.

In terms of the measures taken by the government, the ways to grasp materials can be roughly divided into eight categories: (1) accepting enemy and puppet materials; (2) exporting state-owned production enterprises; (3) accepting loans or donations from friendly countries; (4) dividing enemy reparations; (5) importing goods ordered from abroad; (6) ordering goods obtained through loan methods; (7) purchasing agricultural products by various methods; and (8) products obtained by private enterprises under the control mode. There are fewer problems with items 1 to 5. Item 6 is one of the methods set by the economic reform plan, but it has been half a year and the implementation draft has just been drafted. Under item 7, purchases can be divided into free competitive purchases (such as cotton before the establishment of the Control Committee), national monopolies (such as coal in designated areas by the Fuel Management Committee), and official price purchases (such as rice and grain purchased by various provinces). These have caused a lot of controversy and resistance. Private enterprise products are purchased and sold by the state. The most obvious example is the comprehensive management recently implemented in the textile industry. Whether it can be successfully launched remains to be proven by facts.

The general opinion is that the state should master materials, regardless of its motives, but it must adhere to the following creeds: First, it must take into account the appropriate profits of producers and must not suppress and buy them too cheaply, which will destroy their re-production. Second, it must maintain the survival and development of the original business. Do not kill the chicken to get the eggs, just to seek temporary pleasure. Third, state-owned and private enterprises should advance in parallel on the principle of equal opportunities and fair competition, and should not show favoritism, which will destroy the fragile foundation of national industry. Fourth, the state's control of materials has its great mission and should not be short-sighted and take the opportunity to seek profit. In particular, it cannot allow the officials in charge to manipulate them, which will incur criticism of monopolizing and engaging in private fraud.

The most legitimate uses of the state's control of materials are no more than the following five items: (1) For allocation. The intention is to stabilize prices and enrich people's use. Therefore, regardless of whether the recipients of the allocation are direct consumers or processing manufacturers, once prices are raised and profits are sought, other uses are made, the original intention is completely lost. (2) To promote exports. This was originally a last resort when overseas sales channels were bad. The intention is to promote exports and earn foreign exchange, which is different from purely operating businesses. In order to maintain the interests of domestic producers and to expand overseas markets, the state should have a long-term and permanent vision when collecting these materials, and should not be short-sighted about the current gains and losses, and should do it even if it loses money for a while. (3) For military supply. During war, military use comes first, which is a completely consumptive nature and does not generate profit. (4) To regulate surpluses and deficiencies, that is, to supply the surplus materials from place A to place B where materials are lacking, or to transfer the cheaper goods from place C to place D where prices are higher, so as to achieve the goal of suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood. This should be the greatest function of the state's control of materials. It is also possible to buy cheap and sell expensive in handling this matter, thereby obtaining considerable profits, but since the purpose is to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, even if money is occasionally made, it is only an unexpected byproduct and should not be regarded as a matter of course. (5) To reduce speculation. That is to say, the government controls a large amount of materials, so that ordinary "profiteers" have no goods to hoard, that is, there is no opportunity to speculate, and there is nothing strange to live in, which also seems to make sense. However, if the price of goods controlled by the government rises at any time and follows the black market without the government selling them in batches at a fixed official price, quantity, and time, it is as if the government itself has become a big hoarder, and the original function is lost.

Judging from the above points, we can know that the government's grasp of materials should not take revenue as the sole purpose. Moreover, judging from the language and words publicly announced by the authorities in the past, there has never been a time when the purpose of revenue has been clearly mixed in. Therefore, the public officials who handle this matter should all ask about this meaning, clarify the goal, and avoid all side effects, so as to seek clear promotion and not change or degenerate halfway.

Recently, the government plans to expand distribution to stabilize people's livelihood, and on the one hand, to exchange materials to adjust international trade. These are all legitimate ways to master materials. The exchange of cotton yarn for Indian cotton, the purchase of foreign wheat to supply flour mills for flour production, or the purchase of rapeseed and soybeans to fill the raw materials for oil production, these measures are not without a small supplement to the national economy and people's livelihood. Moreover, this American aid food donation and transportation can promote universal distribution, and the implementation can be commended. It is a pity that there were quite a few short-sighted people in the past who specialized in small calculations and arbitrarily suppressed and blackmailed in the name of fair prices when handling purchases, resulting in unexpected losses to farmers. However, when distributing, they repeatedly raised prices in the name of adjustment, not hesitating to publicly compete with the black market. The huge profits obtained were often discounted and arbitrarily spent, forming a division of fat among a few people, and the funds could not be used for public benefit. There were even cases where the public sector purchased and collected goods in name, while private individuals hoarded them in disguise. They used their strong strength, large institutions, and superior craftsmanship to compete with ordinary merchants and civilians for short-term gains. This is when the country is about to implement a material control policy, and it is necessary to pay close attention and correct it.

### Zhu Shieming Arrives in Shanghai, Going to Nanjing Tonight to Report for Duty

[Report from this newspaper] General Zhu Shieming, Deputy Representative of our country to the United Nations Security Council, arrived in this city at the airport by Northwest Airlines flight at 9 pm last night because he was summoned to report for duty. Those who went to the airport included Xu Zhennan, a specialist from the delegation to China, and others. Zhu's settings have not been resolved today due to the stalemate caused by different opinions between the United States and the Soviet Union in the past. The atmosphere for military aid to China is very enthusiastic. If the military is aided, there is no problem in terms of technology and transportation to give the remaining military supplies in the Pacific to our country. However, the economic and military assistance are all part of a major problem. If the former is resolved, the former is only a technical problem. Today, the United States remembers to determine the principles of assistance to China, but it has not yet decided. Zhu is scheduled to report for duty in Beijing today, saying that he does not.

### On the Matter of Missionary Evacuation, Foreign Reporters Ask Questions; Chairman Replies in Writing

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] United Press news: On the 19th, a United Press reporter asked Chairman Chiang in writing about the fact that some missionaries in some areas were not allowed to evacuate due to the fear of the Communist bandits' intrusion, "Who produced this matter?" Chairman Chiang replied in writing: The missionaries of various Christian denominations in Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and Shandong in North China have been forced to transfer and leave their missionary posts due to the rebellion of the Communist bandits. I am very concerned about their hard work. Our local authorities must be able to carefully protect them and provide them with assistance wherever needed, so that they can quickly escape the poisonous hands of the Communist bandits and reach a safe place as soon as possible. The Communist bandits' inhuman, cruel, and brutal acts are a great stain on the history of human civilization. Wherever the bandits go, they not only destroy the body but also destroy the soul at the same time. The Christian leaders often suffer the most from their harm. Only when our country unites as one and concentrates its efforts to quell the bandits' rebellion and eliminate these human moths as soon as possible can all compatriots in the country be at peace in both material and soul, and the displaced missionaries can return to their homeland and spread the gospel of Christ.

[Report from this newspaper] Peng Xuepei, a member of the Political Committee, returned to Shanghai on the 18th after being ordered to inspect the five provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Yesterday, he met with reporters and said that Jiangxi Province has fertile land and abundant mineral resources, and if it is actively developed, it can become the "Northeast of the South." Guilin is beautiful and picturesque, and if it is properly organized to attract Chinese and foreign tourists, it can become the "Switzerland of the East." Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces can form an economic unit by themselves, with Guangzhou as the export port. The Yuehan, Xiang-Gui, and Zhe-Gan railways are well managed, and efforts should be made to increase their vehicles and railway equipment. In order to connect Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces, the Yue-Gan Railway should be built as soon as possible. The route should be from Qingjiang in Jiangxi to Qujiang in northern Guangdong.

### Tianhe Coal Mine in Ji'an Taken Over by Jiangxi Provincial Government

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 19th] The Tianhe Coal Mine in Ji'an was mined by local people who raised funds in the early years of the Republic of China.

It also formed the Tianhe Coal Mine Guidance Committee. In the future, it will increase the number of night shifts for land and water transportation and sales, so that the daily output can be increased from 60 tons to 200 tons. Water transportation will first improve the river channel, and it is currently surveying the waterway from Tianhe to Ji'an. At the same time, it is also planning to explore new lines.

### Fujian Provincial Council Requests Continued Handling of Fishery Relief

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 19th] Fujian Province is an important fishing area, and more than one million people directly or indirectly depend on aquatic products for their livelihoods. During the war, the coast was severely destroyed by the enemy and puppets, and fishermen suffered heavy losses, and the fishing village economy went bankrupt and needed urgent relief. In the past, the Executive Yuan's fishery relief plan for Fujian Province planned to repair fishing boats and distribute motorized boats, but it has not been implemented. After the Executive Yuan ended, it set up a fishery material management branch to handle it for half a year, but it also failed to achieve any results. It was also recently abolished. The Fujian Provincial Council believes that the distribution of fishery materials will be difficult for Fujian Province to obtain preferential treatment in the future, which is a huge loss to the fishery. Therefore, at this congress, it passed a proposal to "strive to continue to handle the fishery rehabilitation business in Fujian Province in order to relieve fishermen and develop the fishery." The congress telegraphed the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Fishery Management Office, requesting: (1) to continue to set up institutions in Fujian to promote fishery rehabilitation business; (2) to quickly distribute materials, repair fishing boats, and relieve fishermen; (3) to quickly allocate motorized fishing boats and processing equipment for training fishery personnel and improving fishery technology.

### Zibo Coal Mine Crisis: Coal Cannot Be Exported, Transportation Costs Are High, Urgently Awaiting Remedy

[Report from this newspaper, Jinan, 19th] According to Yu Wuheng, director of the Zibo Mining Area of the Resources Committee: The Zibo Mining Area is facing an unprecedented crisis. Since the opening of the Xuji section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the coal from Zaozhuang and other places in southern Shandong has been transported to Jinan by train at a low transportation cost, selling for only 2.6 million per ton. Although the Zibo coal sells for only more than 400,000 per ton at the mine, the transportation cost of transporting it to Jinan by car or horse is 2.6 million yuan. Therefore, the coal stored in Zibo is piled up like mountains and cannot be exported. Before the opening of the Jinan-Zhangdian section of the Jiaoji Railway, the government is urgently hoping for effective relief, otherwise tens of thousands of employees will lose their jobs.

The full text of the methods is as follows:

After the aforementioned price has been paid, the Ministry of Economic Affairs shall issue a payment notice, stipulating a time limit (before the assessment is finalized, the initial estimated price shall still be paid), and then pay 20% of the total initial estimated or assessed price. The remaining 65% may be paid in installments within two years.

Article 2: The 65% of the price that should be paid in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article shall be paid every six months from the date of issuance of the official notice of receipt by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, with the first installment paying 20% of the unpaid price, the second installment 20%, the third installment 15%, and the fourth installment 10%. Each installment of the price may be paid in advance.

Article 3: The procedures for paying the price shall be handled in accordance with the following provisions: (1) Before the price is paid, the Ministry of Economic Affairs shall fill out a five-part payment notice (Form 1), and send the first and third copies to the payer (i.e., the private enterprise purchasing the materials), the second copy to the National Treasury, the fourth copy to the Reparations Committee, and the fifth copy to be kept on file. (2) After receiving the first copy of the payment notice, the payer shall fill out a payment slip (Form 2, owned by the National Treasury) and send the payment slip together with the payment to the designated National Treasury. (3) When the National Treasury receives the aforementioned payment slip, it shall immediately check it against the second copy of the payment notice sent by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. After verifying that there are no errors, the receipt section of the payment slip shall be stamped with the Treasury's receipt stamp and returned to the payer. The payment slip verification copy shall be sent to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for verification. (4) After obtaining the receipt issued by the National Treasury, the payer shall fill in the payment situation on the third copy of the payment notice and submit it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for filing. (5) After the Ministry of Economic Affairs receives the payment slip verification copy from the National Treasury and the third copy of the payment notice sent by the payer, it shall seal and register them, and then forward the payment verification copy to the Ministry of Finance for filing. The fourth copy of the payment notice shall be sent to the Reparations Committee.

Article 4: The price of the purchased materials shall be calculated in US dollars, but the private enterprise receiving the materials may pay in legal currency at the official exchange rate of the Central Bank at the time of each installment.

Article 5: The 5% security deposit paid by the private enterprise receiving the materials may be deducted from the fourth installment of the price.

Article 6: The continuous expenses that the private enterprise receiving the materials should pay from the time the materials are shipped from the Japanese port to the port of our country shall be paid to the Ministry of Economic Affairs in one lump sum after all the materials have been handed over, and then transferred to be reimbursed.

Article 7: The expenses for unloading, storing, insuring, and managing the materials after they arrive at the port of our country, which are paid by the Ministry of Economic Affairs on behalf of the private enterprise, shall be paid to the Ministry of Economic Affairs in one lump sum before taking delivery of the goods to be reimbursed.

After discussion with the competent authorities, it temporarily suspended the supply of daytime electricity and borrowed one month's electricity bill from users in advance to raise funds to purchase coal. As the end of the year is approaching, the factories in this county urgently need to produce, so the factory associations first advanced funds to purchase coal, which has now been transported to Suzhou. The supply of daytime electricity can be resumed from tomorrow to meet the needs of the factories. However, if the coal supply is still difficult to improve in the future, it can only be maintained until the end of this month.

### Main Force of Bandits in Dabie Mountains Eliminated; National Army Begins Mopping-Up Operations

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 19th Dispatch] After the remnants of Liu Bandit's First Column in the Dabie Mountains were defeated by the National Army in Xincai, the main force fled north to Huazhuang, Longkouji, Yangbu and other places, attempting to contact the main force of the Chen Bandit's First, Third, Fourth, Sixth, and Eighth Columns who had committed crimes in Huaiyang from Tongxu and Fugou, and to receive personnel and ammunition supplies. After being severely damaged by the National Army in the area north of Lishan, they have fled east in several groups. Their main force has now arrived at Shuangliushu, Baiqueyuan, Yanjiahe, Doushanhe and other places north of Jingfu.

[Our Newspaper Wuhu, 19th Dispatch] Two hundred soldiers from Baizhou along the river in Wuwu County, who had fled from Tongpingshan, planned to steal across the Yangtze River to the south and flee the remnants of the army in Fanchang. They fled north from the Jiang'an River.

[Central News Agency Hankou, 19th Dispatch] The Second and Sixth Columns of the Communist bandits who had infiltrated between Lixuan and Huashandian intended to peek at the southern section of Pinghan and flee west in the past week. After the National Army launched a fierce attack from three sides, the Eighteenth Brigade and Eight Brigade Headquarters and one regiment of the Sixth Column were completely wiped out in Wangjiadian, north of Lishan. Only 300 or so of another regiment fled east. In this battle, the main force that Bandit Bo Cheng's troops could gather was captured by the National Army and eliminated. The reporter once met a senior person in charge who claimed that since Bandit Liu Bo Cheng's troops fled south to the Dabie Mountains last year, the National Army has carried out a planned encirclement and suppression, and has tied up and routed its rampant main force. The remaining bandits are scattered and active in the mountainous areas. At present, each group of bandits no longer has a concentration of more than a brigade, or has the name of a brigade, but its strength is mostly damaged and insufficient. As for the county towns occupied by the bandits, except for Yingshan and Jingfu, which are waiting to be recovered, they have been recovered by the National Army, and the remnants of the bandits in the four suburbs outside the city have been wiped out. Therefore, the work of suppressing bandits in the Dabie Mountains is currently entering the mopping-up stage, and administrative organizations will soon be rebuilt to carry out the pacification and consolation work after the recovery. According to the total statistics of this encirclement and suppression, from the end of November last year to the present, the various columns of Bandit Liu have been repeatedly attacked, and most of them have been defeated and unable to form an army. The First Column and the Chen Yi and Chen Geng troops, a total of five columns, attacked Queshan for five days and five nights, and were fiercely attacked by the National Army, resulting in 10,000 casualties and a retreat. In addition, the First Column of Bandit Liu was defeated at Wulongdian, south of Xincai, on the night of the 11th. The 59th Regiment of the First Brigade, which was an elite force among the bandits, was known as the "Hero Regiment". One of the strongest battalions was completely wiped out that night. The Seventh Brigade of the Third Column was defeated in the northeast of Huoshan, and the regimental commander was killed. The Ninth Brigade was encircled and suppressed by the National Army in Zijinhe, north of Taihu Lake, and was largely disintegrated. The 17th Brigade of the Sixth Column was repeatedly attacked by the National Army in Baiqueyuan and Xiongjiaxing, east of Macheng, and all fled east of Huangpi Station. In the Battle of Liulin, the Tenth and Twelfth Columns of the Chen bandits were wiped out by the National Army, resulting in 8,000 casualties. The number of prisoners of war reached more than 2,000. At present, the combat effectiveness of the 18th Brigade and the 7th Brigade of the 10th Column of Bandit Liu has been completely lost. Other bandit units can only carry out mobile harassment, hoping to cover up their administrative cadres and local native communists who are scattered in many places. According to statistics, since the encirclement and suppression of the Dabie Mountains began on November 27 last year, the results of 50 days of battle are as follows: a total of 9,528 bandits were killed, and 1,908 rifles, 91 light machine guns, 3 heavy machine guns, 31 pistols, 4 small artillery pieces, 15 mortars, 35 grenade launchers, 2 telephones, 206 horses, and 1 car were seized. At present, Bandit Liu still has the numbers of the Second, Third, and Sixth Columns in the Dabie Mountains, as well as soldiers from the Second and Third detachments, etc., who are using the vast mountainous area to wage guerrilla warfare. It will take some time to eliminate them. The responsible authorities have decided to implement a plan to fundamentally eliminate the bandits by excluding the military from politics, organizing and training the people, and establishing local self-defense forces. Bandit Liu's skills are exhausted, and his dream of establishing a base in the Dabie Mountains has been completely shattered.

### British Parliament Reopens Today; Bevin's Foreign Policy to Change Course

[United Press London, 18th Dispatch] Parliament, which adjourned for a month for the Christmas holidays, is scheduled to reopen on Tuesday. A two-day debate on foreign affairs will begin on Thursday, at which time Foreign Secretary Bevin will present the government's foreign policy. Since the breakdown of the London Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, British foreign policy has been re-established after several cabinet meetings. In addition, Parliament will discuss the bill to nationalize the gas industry. The most important bill of this session may be the budget bill to be submitted by Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps in April. After Parliament resumes, there will inevitably be a dispute over the annual salary of Princess Elizabeth and her husband.

[United Press London, 18th Dispatch] When Foreign Secretary Bevin presents British foreign policy to Parliament on Thursday, he will state that the Labor government's strategy for dealing with communism is no longer merely defensive, but should promote strong cooperation between Western Europe and the United States. As for the Soviet Union, it is only willing to seek understanding on an equal footing of fifty-fifty. This is the only hope for preserving the freedom-loving nations and democratic ideals of all countries. What Bevin has in mind for cooperation between Western Europe and the United States is generally economic in nature, and not a military alliance, at least in the initial stage, so as to lay a certain foundation for completing the Marshall Plan for European recovery. Bevin's speech may be Britain's formal abandonment of the middle-of-the-road policy, and it will no longer try to reconcile the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States originally hoped to become a bridge between the East and West during the transitional period from the end of the war to the signing of the peace treaty, but now it has to change course. There have been signs of this new strategy recently, as Prime Minister Attlee and Deputy Prime Minister Morrison have successively delivered speeches, which are the beginnings of it.

### Britain Concerned About Ruhr Situation; Appeals to US for Food Relief to Prevent Turmoil

[Our Newspaper Report] New York 19th Broadcast: Washington News, British Foreign Secretary Bevin made an urgent appeal to the US, requesting that food be quickly transported to Germany in order to prevent the increasingly serious unrest in that area. Secretary of State Marshall and the military department decided to give it priority consideration. [Reuters Washington 18th Dispatch] Authoritative sources say: British officials have informed the US State Department of the British government's greatest concern about the current situation in Germany, and have asked the US to cooperate with Britain in every possible way to deal with it. British officials pointed out that the best solution is to have a steady stream of American grains and other food into the Anglo-American merged area, and have requested the State Department to study the possibility of this matter.

British Ambassador Inver Chapel will visit Secretary of State Marshall this week to discuss this matter. It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Bevin is extremely worried about the current situation in Germany, believing that it may cause serious repercussions throughout Western Europe and hinder the implementation of the Marshall Plan. When British officials informed the State Department of Bevin's intentions, they emphasized that although Britain is responsible for the public security of the Ruhr area, the US has to take responsibility for importing food to help the area. It is expected that US officials will review this week the possibility of transferring food originally intended to be transported to other places to the Ruhr to reduce the cause of the Ruhr turmoil. [Reuters Berlin 18th Dispatch] People close to the Soviet military government said that the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Army in Germany, Sokolovsky, returned to Moscow a week ago to discuss the new economic and administrative measures for the Anglo-American merged area with senior Soviet authorities. He was originally scheduled to return to Berlin on the 17th, but did not return because the weather was bad and he could not travel. It is detained because the discussion has not yet ended, and it has not yet been ascertained. But it is expected to return to Berlin before the Berlin Music Management Committee meets on Monday. At the same time, it is reported that the German People's Congress, which is scheduled to meet on March 18, will hold a vote on the issue of holding a plebiscite throughout the country to decide on political and economic unification. If the Soviet Union withdraws from the Allied Control Council and establishes an East German state, this plebiscite throughout Germany will not be held. Therefore, it is expected that after the Soviet Union raises serious protests against the new economic and administrative measures for the Anglo-American merged area, it will sit and observe its repercussions, and will not immediately withdraw from the Allied Control Council.

### Ruhr Coal Production Decreases

[Associated Press Berlin, 19th Dispatch] General Clay, commander of the American occupation zone in Germany, reported to Washington on the 19th that coal production in the Ruhr area has been seriously affected due to a lack of timber and other materials.

### British and French Finance Ministers Agree; French Franc to Be Devalued; But Does Not Affect the Current Value of the British Pound

[Associated Press London, 18th Dispatch] Well-informed sources said on the 18th that Britain and France agreed on the 18th to devalue the French franc without affecting the current value of the British pound. This plan was completed after a meeting between British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps and French Finance Minister Meyer. It is rumored that they intend to devalue the French franc from 119 to one US dollar to 250 to one US dollar. On the other hand, the purpose of this financial strategy is to promote the purchase of food and renovation of industrial machinery by the two countries, which is of great benefit to the European recovery plan.

[Reuters Paris, 18th Dispatch] French Finance Minister Meyer returned to Paris today from London after meeting with British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps. Meyer refused to make any comments after getting off the plane.

### Soviet Delegation to Arrive in London This Week - To Continue Business Negotiations - Discussion of Details for Purchasing British Industrial Equipment

(United Press International, London, 19th) A 19-member Soviet delegation is expected to arrive in London this week to begin discussions on purchasing industrial equipment under the Anglo-Soviet trade agreement signed in Moscow last month. The equipment will include railway tracks, locomotives, trucks, sawmill equipment, and scientific instruments, and the shipment of these materials is scheduled to be completed within one to three years. The Soviet delegation will be led by Mr. Gusev, Director of the Soviet Machinery Import Department. British officials believe that the arrival of the Soviet delegation indicates that the Soviet Union does not want to mix politics and commerce, and is therefore willing to conduct commercial negotiations even when political relations with Western Europe are very disharmonious. Previously, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Trade Secretary Wilson had also expressed their strong desire to develop trade relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Under the new Anglo-Soviet trade agreement, Britain can import 750,000 tons of coarse grains from the Soviet Union before September of this year, while the latter will obtain from Britain 25,000 to 35,000 tons of light railway tracks, 1,100 narrow-gauge locomotive front-ends, 2,400 freight cars, 210 excavators, 200 broad-gauge locomotives, 150 fifty-kilowatt generators, scientific instruments worth £1.5 million, and sawmill machinery worth £1 million. The above-mentioned mechanical equipment will be contracted by various private British factories, and the British government will give them priority in obtaining raw materials so that they can be completed and delivered as soon as possible, with the delivery scheduled to be completed within three years. Detailed deadlines have been set in Moscow by experts from both Britain and the Soviet Union. Britain will assist the Soviet Union in purchasing wool, rubber, aluminum, cocoa beans, etc. The first Soviet shipment of grains for feeding livestock is expected to arrive here next month.

### U.S. Congress Favors Reducing First Year's Aid to Europe - Taft Believes it Should Not Exceed $3 Billion

(Reuters, Washington, 19th) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, resuming its review of the Marshall Plan today, expressed even more severe criticism of the plan, aiming to reduce appropriations for the first year of its implementation. This trend has become increasingly evident in Congress. Government officials have completed their statements on the plan, and starting this week, those who will make statements will be figures who criticize the plan.

Among those who appeared today to make statements was the well-known economist and presidential advisor Baruch, who will present his views on both the amount of aid and the method of management. Senators who had previously met with him said that Baruch did not fervently support the Marshall Plan. Those who will appear before the Foreign Relations Committee on Monday include Republican foreign policy advisor Dulles, etc. While Truman has requested $6.8 billion for European aid in the initial fifteen months, some members of Congress are advocating reducing the first year's aid to Europe to $4 billion. Republican Senator Taft argues for an even greater reduction. He pointed out that the European recovery plan expenses in Truman's proposed budget for the next fiscal year are actually only $4 billion, so he believes that the president is already anticipating a reduction in the amount of aid. Taft also said: Recently, there has been a proposal that the aid to Europe paid by the U.S. Treasury in the first year should not exceed $4 billion, but the government is allowed to order other supplies beyond this amount. In other words, the government will still need to ask Congress for approval of appropriations when paying for these other supplies, thus giving Congress another opportunity to discuss the implementation of the European aid plan. Taft further stated that he personally believes that the aid to Europe paid by the U.S. Treasury in the first year should not exceed $3 billion. Moreover, Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, recently stated that his committee will also study the possibility of reducing the cash allocated for European aid in the first year. He emphasized, "In any case, the Senate Appropriations Committee will conduct a thorough review of the European aid plan before passing the appropriations."

(United Press International, Washington, 18th) Leading figures of the Republican Party in both the House and Senate will meet on the 19th to prepare to launch the first attack on President Truman's proposed budget, opening the way for the passage of their tax cut bill. The meeting was convened to determine the maximum amount that Congress can allocate for government expenses in the 1949 fiscal year, but at the same time to discuss strategies to enable the tax cut proposal to be forced through Congress even if Truman exercises his veto power. Truman's budget proposes government expenses of $39.7 billion. House Speaker Martin, who will chair the meeting, declined to say how much of the president's expense figures could be reduced. Other Republican leaders are demanding a reduction of $3 billion to $5 billion.

### Receiving the First Batch of American Relief Flour - Welcome Ceremony at the China Merchants Wharf - Leaders Attending Create a Grand Occasion - The Friendship in Adversity Will Be Forever Remembered by the Chinese People

(Report from this newspaper) The first American aid to China relief shipment, the "California," carrying 8,482 long tons of flour, totaling 190,000 bags, arrived at Wharf No. 1 of the China Merchants Bureau at 11 a.m. the day before yesterday. Miao Jiaming, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling American Relief Materials, considered this aid to China shipment to be of great significance. To express gratitude, he held a welcome ceremony at the wharf at 3 p.m. yesterday, inviting U.S. Consul General Cabot, Moody, the Acting Director of the American United China Relief, and various American representatives from the relevant relief organizations to participate. The ceremony was co-hosted by Wu, the Chairman of the Shanghai Distribution Committee for American Relief Materials, and Mayor Wu. Other attendees included City Council Speaker Pan, Vice Minister of Food Guan Jiyu, Vice Minister of Social Affairs Huang Bodu, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Economic Commission Gu Yuxun, Dr. Yen Hui-ching, U.S. Deputy Consul General Billig, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Committee for Handling Relief Materials Chen Guangyuan, and Director of the U.S. Information Service Connors, totaling about 60 people.

First, Chairman Miao, Mayor Wu, and others led the visitors to inspect the large warehouse of flour on the "California." Workers were unloading flour at the time, working very busily. It is reported that after the ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, unloading began immediately. Six hundred workers are working day and night, and about 30,000 bags have already been unloaded. All the flour is expected to be unloaded by Saturday of this week, at which time the ship will set sail back to the United States. It is estimated that five large warehouses will be needed to accommodate all the flour. Another ship, the "Nicholas Labadia," carrying 8,700 long tons of wheat, has also arrived in Shanghai and is moored at buoys No. 4 and No. 5, and is currently being unloaded. The wheat is in bulk, and while workers are unloading it, it is being sent to major flour mills in the city to speed up the milling process. All the goods will also take six to eight days to unload.

Chairman Miao Delivers a Speech Expressing Gratitude

After the guests visited the China Merchants Bureau warehouse, Chairman Miao hosted a tea party. During the party, Mr. Miao said in his speech that after the Chinese and American governments signed the agreement on American relief materials worth 30 million U.S. dollars to China on October 27th of last year, both sides intensified their work and prepared separately. The Chinese government organized this committee, and the American government also actively purchased materials necessary for the lives of the Chinese people as relief supplies, especially food, as well as medical supplies and some fertilizers, seeds, etc. I am deeply grateful today as I receive the first shipment of materials here. The transportation and handling of materials over the past two months have been carried out smoothly without delay, thanks to the cooperation between the two governments and the constant exchange of views with Mr. Kirkpatrick, Director of the American United China Relief, and Acting Director Moody. I would like to express my sincere gratitude on behalf of the Chinese government to the American government and its people, as well as to the captain and crew of the ship.

Distribution Committees Established in Five Major Cities

Mr. Miao also reported that the "Hawaii" will arrive in Shanghai on the 26th of this month, carrying 7,000 tons of flour. In addition, the "Washington Mail" and another ship are also scheduled to load grain and come to Shanghai in the second half of this month. All 125,000 tons of relief food will arrive within two to three months. It has now been decided to first establish distribution committees in the five major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Beiping, and Tianjin. According to the population of the five cities, the distribution will be carried out in a fair and universal manner, and each person can get five liters of rice per month, which is expected to last for four months. If calculated according to the need for one and a half pecks of rice per person per month, it can solve one-third of the need. The distribution price is slightly lower than the market price and will be adjusted once a month, which can also stabilize part of the price of goods.

All the funds obtained from the distribution will be used for universal relief. This committee has organized two committees, namely the Health and Medical Committee and the Social Relief Committee, which are chaired by the Minister of Social Affairs and the Minister of Health, respectively. Relief agencies in urgent need of these items can apply to this committee. If the facts permit, this committee may also establish its own relief organizations, and funds will be allocated after joint planning and review by Chinese and American experts.

Symbolizing Mutual Love Between the Two Countries

Then, U.S. Consul General Cabot gave a speech, stating that he was very pleased to be able to participate in today's ceremony to receive the first batch of materials upon his arrival here. This relief material symbolizes the mutual love and sincere help between the peoples of the two countries. I firmly believe that the future world will be one in which people who love freedom can live together in peace and prosperity. This food is a gift from the American people to the Chinese people who are currently suffering temporarily, and can be regarded as evidence that the United States is willing to continue to provide relief and restore the post-war order.

Heaven Helps Those Who Help Themselves - Solving Difficulties

Mayor Wu then gave a speech, quoting the phrases "Heaven helps those who help themselves" and "Friendship in adversity," saying that in the current difficulties and hardships of China, on the one hand, we must do our best to help ourselves solve difficulties, and on the other hand, we must rely on our American friends in "friendship in adversity" to continue to supply our country with materials. On behalf of the people of Shanghai, I would like to thank the United States.

Finally, City Council Speaker Pan gave a speech on behalf of the Shanghai City Council, saying that before and after the War of Resistance, China and the United States fought together and became "friends in difficulty." After the war, the Chinese people received the help of "friends in adversity" in construction and reconstruction. This sincere friendship will be forever remembered by the Chinese people. The Shanghai City Council expresses its deep gratitude and welcome to the American relief materials that have been shipped to Shanghai.

### Grain Distribution by Headcount to Begin in February or March - Rice Allocation to Public Servants and Workers to be Abolished at That Time

(Report from this newspaper) Citywide grain distribution by headcount is scheduled to be implemented from mid-February or early March. At that time, a voucher purchase system will also be implemented. The detailed implementation measures are currently being drafted. Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian told reporters yesterday that the purpose of implementing this system is to conserve grain consumption. In the future, regardless of their status or occupation, all citizens of the city will be required to consume two pecks of rice per month per person, with a reduction for small households. One peck will be distributed by the government, and one peck will be allowed to be purchased from the free market. The government will issue "distribution certificates" and "purchase certificates" separately. At that time, the method of allocating rice to public servants and industrial workers will be abolished. Restaurants and hotels will be issued a certain amount of rice each month for the consumption of the mobile population without household registration in the city. After the implementation of this system, rice circulation will not be prohibited, but rice shops will not be allowed to sell food to customers without "purchase certificates." The government will check whether rice merchants have cheated based on the quantity of goods they have imported and the purchase certificates they have redeemed. Because every citizen can still buy one peck of rice from a rice shop, the livelihood of rice merchants is not threatened. The government will also control flour to prevent loopholes. If citizens are not accustomed to eating rice but prefer to eat flour, they can declare their intention to buy flour instead when receiving the purchase certificates, calculating one bag of flour for every four pecks of rice. However, once the declaration is confirmed, it cannot be changed. The above-mentioned business is the responsibility of the Civil Food Allocation Committee. The allocation committee currently only presides over the allocation of food for 1.3 million people. Now that it will shoulder the heavy responsibility of food allocation for the city's 5 million citizens, it must be reorganized and expanded.

### Standing Committee Member of the Allocation Committee Goes to Nanjing to Attend a Meeting of the Ministry of Food

### Social Affairs Bureau Spot Checks Grain Merchants - Registration Temporarily Suspended for Two Months

However, changes to the registration information will still be processed as they arrive and are not subject to this restriction. The bureau has issued notices to all relevant trade associations and announced them to the public.

### Industry Association Calls Again - Open Industrial Loans to Alleviate Emergency

(Report from this newspaper) The National Federation of Industries recently issued another telegram to Chairman Chiang and the Executive Yuan, calling on the government to open industrial loans as soon as possible to alleviate the urgent needs of various industries, as the Lunar New Year is approaching in the blink of an eye and all industries are in dire need of funds. The original telegram stated that since the government stopped industrial loans, the production circles in various places have felt pain. Although there may have been imperfections in the past in handling industrial loans, one should not stop eating because of choking. Now that the Lunar New Year is not far away, if the government does not provide loans, some factories will be forced to close due to insufficient capital turnover, and the consequences will not only cause workers to lose their jobs, but also seriously affect the entire financial community.

### Safe Deposit Box Found Inside the False Wall of the Bank of Communications

The Bank of Communications is currently renovating the interior of its building at the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Sichuan Road. The bank has entrusted the Fuchi Construction Company of this city to carry out the construction project. Several days ago, workers from the company discovered a false wall built at the bottom layer while dismantling the left and right walls. The wall was covered with patterned paper. The workers immediately dismantled the false wall and discovered a green safe deposit box. They immediately dispatched personnel to notify the Bank of Communications authorities. After receiving the news, the Bank of Communications authorities, for the sake of prudence, sealed the box for safekeeping and have drafted an official document to report to the bank's authorities for instructions. It is understood that the building was the Russian-owned Daosheng Bank before the First World War. After the end of the First World War, it was converted into the German-owned Dehua Bank. During the period of enemy occupation, it was occupied by financial institutions of the puppet government. After the victory, it was taken over by the Bank of Communications. Therefore, the building has changed hands several times and has undergone many vicissitudes. According to general speculation, this large safe deposit box may have been used to store old items during the First World War. As for the contents of the box, it will be opened and revealed only after instructions from the authorities.

Zhang told him that he did not need to find a job and that he should be responsible for transporting morphine, with a reward of 20,000 yuan for each shipment. For convenience during the journey, he impersonated a colonel. The forged credentials of a colonel staff officer of the Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense, as well as a pistol and twenty-four bullets, were also given to him by Zhang. On December 11th of last year, he accompanied Zhang from Beiping to Shanghai. The morphine was hidden on Zhang Guangyu's person.

[Our Own Report] The Shanghai Winter Relief Committee, because students in various schools have launched solicitations for winter clothing and cash, the procedures and methods are not in accordance with central regulations, which are prone to abuses and will affect the city's unified fundraising and distribution plan.

If schools in the city conduct fundraising in the future, they should follow the above decision-making methods and report in detail the amount of winter clothing and cash that has been raised and the past distribution work to the Winter Relief Committee. Furthermore, when schools distribute winter clothing, they must first contact the Winter Relief Committee to designate the distribution areas to avoid uneven distribution or duplication, and they must request the Municipal Government to order the district chiefs and Baojia chiefs to assist.

### Verdict on Huang Baihui Shooting Case Set for 24th

Judge Zhong of the Second Criminal Division conducted a secret trial. Yesterday morning at 10:30, the trial continued, with Zheng Desheng's son, Baowen, being questioned first. Zheng continued to deny the charges. Huang Baihui testified that Zheng had attempted to seize his Shih Pao Building property and had privately taken over a large amount of enemy and puppet materials. When the authorities investigated, he suspected Huang of informing on him, leading to the grudge and the shooting. The court then ordered the start of the debate. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that the two foreign women, Jia Siweituo and Moxiu, had no prior animosity with the plaintiff and had never met him. However, they were acquaintances of the defendant. Considering the defendant's grudge against the plaintiff, it was undoubtedly the defendant who instigated the shooting. The lawyer requested that the defendant be punished according to the law and that a civil suit be attached, demanding that the defendant compensate 3,235,000 yuan. The defendant's lawyer then presented the defense. The court declared the debate concluded and scheduled the verdict for 11:00 AM on the 24th.

### Military Police Crack Major Drug Case; Main Culprit is Retired General

[Report from this newspaper] The large drug trafficking case recently cracked by the 3rd Independent Battalion of the Military Police in this city reportedly involves a retired high-ranking general colluding with active-duty air force personnel to transport drugs. Their organization is very strict. The headquarters is located in Kunming, and the person in charge in Shanghai is a retired army general who once held the position of deputy commander. The seized drugs were found hidden under the spring bed in his home. The case was cracked under the command of the Nanjing Military Police Headquarters, with simultaneous actions taken in Kunming and Shanghai. The main culprits and accomplices in Kunming have also been arrested. In Shanghai, in addition to unscrupulous active-duty air force personnel and a retired army general, a certain Party committee member and a university lecturer involved in selling drugs were also arrested. The drug trafficking organization's transportation network has now been completely dismantled. The sales network is still under investigation, and there may be further developments, so full details cannot be released at this time. It is also understood that because the case involves both Kunming and Shanghai, all suspects will be tried in Nanjing.

### Cheating the Public; Reported by Workers

[Report from this newspaper] Zhenxing Socks Factory, located at No. 1, Lane 2, Yuqing Lane, North Zhejiang Road, Datong Road, is operated by Cai Zisheng. The factory has ten textile machines and more than ten workers. However, when applying for yarn allocation from the Textile Company, Cai falsely reported having thirty-eight textile machines. Each month, the company allocated fifty packages of 20-count yarn, twenty-eight packages of 32-count yarn, and fourteen packages of 42-count thread. Cai also applied to the Social Affairs Bureau for eight large packages of rice per month for worker rations. The excess yarn and rice were transported to Nanhui to open another factory. Because of slack business at the Shanghai factory, Cai planned to lay off some workers. Worker representative Ling Yingzhen reported the situation to the Social Affairs Bureau. After investigation, the Social Affairs Bureau's Third Section confirmed the report and transferred the case to the District Procuratorate for investigation on fraud charges.

### Housing Shortage in Hangzhou

[Report from our Hangzhou correspondent on the 18th] Due to widespread wartime destruction, there is a housing shortage everywhere after the victory. Although Hangzhou's housing shortage is not as severe as Shanghai's, and gold bars are not demanded at every turn like in Shanghai, this is mainly due to objective conditions. Hangzhou was originally a scenic and political city. In Shanghai, merchants have money and do not care about a few gold bars, but for the average Hangzhou resident, paying millions or tens of millions of yuan to secure a house is already a very substantial burden. Moreover, Hangzhou's rent is calculated in rice. The monthly rent for an ordinary small room requires one or two dan (a unit of weight) of rice. The price of rice fluctuates at any time, which is much higher than the rent in Shanghai. Furthermore, Hangzhou is close to Shanghai and has convenient transportation. Landlords are influenced by Shanghai and always want to

Raise security deposits and rents as much as possible. Therefore, the housing problem has always been a serious issue in Hangzhou. Recently, bandit activities in various counties and villages have led to a trend of population concentration in cities. Hangzhou's population has increased significantly compared to before the war. During the restoration period, the government is dealing with countless issues and has no time to worry about housing, nor does it have the financial resources to build them. As a result, landlords are squeezing even more severely, and the problem has become even more serious.

Last year, the Zhejiang branch of UNRRA also made efforts to alleviate the housing shortage and built a large number of "Post-War Reconstruction Villages." However, they were like a small amount of porridge among many monks, and only a very small number of poor people benefited. Even so, it was UNRRA's greatest effort. The municipal government had also planned to

Build a large number of affordable housing units behind Baoshu Mountain, but it has not yet materialized, while the housing shortage continues to threaten citizens, especially impoverished public servants and teachers. The provincial government recently decided to build public servant housing at Shuitingzhi, which will begin construction soon, but there will only be five buildings in total, which is not enough for allocation. Although the government has clearly ordered that public servant salaries will be issued according to the cost of living index from now on, rent is calculated according to the price of rice, and salaries still cannot keep up. Some public servants' entire monthly income is not even enough to pay rent. They say, "We can barely survive without eating for a day, but if there is a problem with housing for a day, we will have nowhere to live." In order to solve this problem, more than 400 people have signed up to organize a Tenants' Association,

Issue a declaration to appeal to all sectors to uphold justice and unite all tenants to seek effective methods to deal with the situation collectively. This is not only a problem for public servants and teachers themselves, but also a problem that affects all citizens of Hangzhou. Therefore, many people sympathize and respond. In their declaration, they specifically put forward:

Eight demands:
Rent shall not be calculated in rice, nor shall any extraction fees, tips, security deposits, or other similar items be charged.

Rent should be determined and promulgated by the competent authority, inviting representatives from the Housing Association and the Joint Association to form a Hangzhou Rent Collection Committee to set standards.

All vacant houses, except for a few reserved for the landlord's own use, should be rented out completely.

Houses rented for a fixed term shall not be taken back unless the term has expired, and those that have expired shall have the priority of continued rental.

Demand that the government quickly build a large number of affordable houses, such as the houses in Chongqing during the Anti-Japanese War, to benefit the people and avoid the housing shortage.

Demand that the court uphold justice and not make judgments that favor landlords.

Landlords shall not force tenants to move out through illegal means. If landlords are unreasonable, we tenants should also use collective strength to assist those in need.

Request all banks to stop lending to merchants, and the government should order or instruct them to invest in building houses for rent to alleviate the threat of a housing shortage. If these hopes can be thoroughly realized, the housing shortage can be easily solved, and it will not only cease to be "serious" but may also no longer be a "problem."

The public opinion is very supportive of this movement. On the one hand, they demand that the government quickly propose

Solutions to the housing shortage, on the other hand, they appeal to large and secondary landlords to show moral spirit, take a long-term view, and make concessions to the poor citizens and public servants of Hangzhou. Although the joint declaration of public servants and teachers is not a law, it has stirred up waves among the citizens of Hangzhou and has received heartfelt sympathy. It is hoped that the influence of this declaration will at least alleviate the housing shortage in Hangzhou, so that impoverished public servants and citizens will no longer worry about housing day and night, and can focus on serving society.

### Chongming Subsidized Corn; Zhou Qixiang and Others Accused of Embezzlement; Transferred to Fengxian District Court for Trial

[Report from our Fengxian correspondent on the 17th] Due to the food panic in Chongming County last spring, former County Magistrate Guo invited various institutions to bid with foreign grain merchants for centrally and provincially subsidized corn, and purchased 3,600 dan of corn. He entrusted the county's Grain Association to be responsible for distributing and selling it at subsidized prices. Afterwards, Chen Yonghui and Cai Shaolun, representatives of the Chengqiao Township people, accused the chairman of the association, Zhou Qixiang, in collusion with Wu Qiuping, chairman of the county's Chamber of Commerce, and Huang Yixiao, chairman of the Fisheries Association, of using their positions and opportunities to embezzle the corn. There was no subsidized grain for sale on the market, and the poor did not benefit from it. They reported it to the county's District Procuratorate. After several interrogations, Zhou Qixiang and others were prosecuted for breach of trust. The first public trial was held on November 5th. Subsequently, the defendant applied for a transfer of jurisdiction, and the Suzhou High Court designated this county's District Court to hear the case. Yesterday afternoon (16th) was the date of the public trial. The plaintiffs Chen and Cai, and the defendants Zhou Qixiang and others, all reported on time. Presiding over the trial was Chief Judge Lu of this county's District Court. The plaintiffs stated the above, and a neighborhood chief testified that there was no subsidized sale on the market. According to the defendants Zhou Qixiang, Wu Qiuping, and others, the corn was distributed to the four districts for subsidized sale at a price of 120,000 yuan per dan, entirely for local relief of the food shortage and to suppress grain prices, and there was no embezzlement. After review, Judge Lu ordered a postponement for further interrogation of witnesses.

### Striving for Hunan's Coal Production

[Report from our Changsha correspondent on the 15th] Coal can be broadly divided into two types: bituminous coal and anthracite. Both are used as fuel. However, bituminous coal contains a high volatile matter content, has a long flame, and often contains oil. Therefore, it is usually used to power machinery and boilers, and is the main fuel for industry and transportation. At the same time, because it contains various chemical substances, it can be obtained through low-temperature distillation to produce various chemical products, such as gasoline, heavy oil, asphalt, and various bright and useful pigments. Therefore, bituminous coal has great value in industry. As for anthracite, its value is less than that of bituminous coal. Anthracite is commonly known as firewood coal, and is also called white coal. It has low volatile matter and is usually only used as a fuel for cooking in households. Therefore, it is an essential commodity for humans, especially in big cities. If there is a bituminous coal shortage, its seriousness is no less than a shortage of rice.

China's coal mines are mostly in the north. The famous ones include Fushun and Kailuan in the northeast, Jingxing in Shanxi, Lincheng in Shandong, Jiaozuo in Anhui and Henan, Fuzhong Company, and Jiawang in Jiangsu. These are all very large coal mines with abundant reserves extending over a very wide area. Before the war, when the output of each mine was at its highest, one mine could produce 25,000 metric tons of coal per day.

The production quantity of northern coal mines is quite considerable. As for Hunan, it has always been known as a land of fish and rice. In principle, it is a rice-producing area, and mineral resources are not expected to be rich. But strangely, Hunan is blessed with unique advantages. On the one hand, it is crisscrossed by lakes and marshes, producing fish and rice; on the other hand, it is covered by mountains and has abundant mineral resources. Leaving aside mineral deposits such as iron and lead, coal is also a major resource in Hunan. Its quantity is naturally less than that of the north, but it is about 1,270 trillion tons, making it the leading province in the southwest.

The growth of coal mines in Hunan varies greatly due to geological conditions. Some are in the form of packages or troughs. Miners call them troughs or seams. Relatively few are evenly spread and widely extended. Geologists divide their distribution into five coal formations: Xiang River, Qianyang, Chenxi, Douling, and Shimenkou. The distribution area is roughly in the Xiang River basin in Weisha, Xiangtan, Ningxiang, Xiangxiang, Liling, Youxian, Hengshan, Hengyang, Changning, Lingling, Leiyang, Yongxing, Zixing, Chenxian, Guiyang, Jiahe, and Linyu. Each county in Yijun, Yiyang, Anhua, Xinhua, Shaoyang, and Wugang in the Zi-Yong River basin, Yuanling, Chenxi, Luxi, Xupu, Qianyang, Huitong, and Zhijiang each county in the Yuan River basin. In addition, Shimen, Cili, Tanxian, Dayong, and Sangzhi also have coal. The distribution is so wide that it can be said to cover the entire province. In the past, Westerners thought that eastern China was full of gold, which was an exaggeration. But it is not an exaggeration to call Hunan

Covered in black coal. It is definitely a 100% fact. Before the war, coal mines in southern Hunan were not valued by the Chinese. Everyone's attention was focused on the north, so Hunan coal was like an abandoned child left by the roadside, ignored by everyone. Even though Hunan had been mining coal for a long time, the scale was incomparable to that of the north. However, times are constantly changing, and this abandoned child-like Hunan coal, since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, has found it difficult to get coal from the north because the north was harassed by the communists. The north has become a place of turmoil, transportation has been disrupted. Even Qingdao in Shandong which is where the coal came from experienced coal shortages. Everyone then shifted their attention to Hunan, so Hunan coal suddenly embarked on a magnificent journey and became a hundred times more valuable. The development of coal mines in Hunan has achieved amazing results in recent years. The management and operation can be roughly divided into four categories: state-owned, provincial-owned, publicly-owned, and privately-owned. State-owned mines are all managed by the Resources Committee of the Executive Yuan. In addition to the Xiangyong and other mines in Yongxing, which are jointly operated by the government and merchants and produce anthracite coal, the rest of the Lingling Heishankou and Shaoyang Niumasi operated by the Yongshao Coal Mine Bureau, the Xiangtan Tanjishan operated by the Zhonghu Coal Mine Bureau, the Xiangtan Yangjiaqiao operated by the Xiangjiang Coal Mine Company, which is jointly operated by the government and merchants, and the various districts of the Huxiang Coal Mine (operating Yunhu in Xiangtan) and Zhongxiang Coal Mine, which are jointly operated with the provincial government, all produce bituminous coal. The current output of Yongshao is about 3,000 tons per month, and Xiangjiang is about 6,000 tons, totaling about 10,000 tons. In addition, all are

In the equipment preparation period. As for the state-owned mines in Chenxi and Xiangxiang, which have also been designated, construction has not yet begun.

The provincial-owned mines include Liling, Qiyang Guanyintan, and Ningxiang Qingxi. Liling and Qiyang used to produce 15,000 to 16,000 tons per month. However, they were severely damaged during the war. Since they did not request reconstruction funds from the central government, they had to make do with what they had, collecting and repairing some of the remaining damaged machinery to urgently resume operations. Now, Liling can only produce more than 2,000 tons of coal per month, and Guanyintan produces more than 5,000 tons of coal.

Among the publicly-owned coal mines, the largest in scale are the Yangmeishan in Yizhang, Guaguling in Zixing, and Huashi in Xiangtan, which were previously run by Mr. Zeng Yangfu of the Guangzhou Headquarters. The current output is about 16,000 to 17,000 metric tons per month.

In addition, the most coal mines in Hunan are privately-owned coal mines. There are a total of more than 400 privately-owned companies and mines that have been approved and licensed by the government. Those that are still in progress and have not been licensed are not included in the calculation. However, apart from Sanhe in Chenxian, Shouyi, Xunhui in Ningxiang, Hezhu in Chenxi, Huimin, and a few others, which are relatively large in scale, most of the rest are small capital operations without large-scale engineering equipment. The total monthly output of the above four types of mines is less than 50,000 tons, which is a far cry from the 20,000 tons per day produced by each mine in the north in the past. Today, the coal production in the north is on the verge of complete stagnation. Whether the war continues to expand, or even if the war does not spread, some of the original machinery has been moved away. It is already impossible to restore its former glory in the short term. Hunan has gifted coal deposits and a relatively stable situation, which is getting "timing" and "location." If "human harmony" is added, then the description of Hunan coal mines is truly limitless. If coal mines can be developed in Hunan, it will not only benefit the national economy of Hunan Province, but also be related to the needs of national industry and the supply of fuel for military water and land transportation. Therefore, people in Hunan, both in the province and abroad, know to strive for income in this area. The central government is also paying close attention to the development of Hunan coal mines. Vice Chairman Sun Yueqi, who used to travel on the northern roads, also moved to Hunan to inspect, explaining that the central government's view on coal mining is that it is better to start with small quantities in Hunan than to attempt large-scale mining in the north, which is temporarily impossible. As the saying goes, "More in hand is better than more in sight." Moreover, if everyone concentrates their efforts, with Hunan's abundance of coal deposits, it is not impossible to increase production by 10,000 to 20,000 tons per day. From Hunan's economic standpoint, striving for Hunan coal production is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity today. We should seize this opportunity and not let it slip away!

[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 18th] Gu Fuxing, a bandit who lurked in the southern countryside during the occupation, surrendered to the Wuxi City Defense Command after the victory and was appointed as a Special Commissioner for Bandit Suppression by the government and deputy commander of the Zhouxin Self-Defense Force. In fact, his surrender was at the instigation of a certain bandit leader to infiltrate southern Wuxi, with ulterior motives. He secretly maintained contact with Xue Yonghui, a Taihu bandit, probing public sentiment and plotting wrongdoing. In October of last year, the Wuxi Command discovered this, and together with the 9th Regiment of the Military Police, apprehended Gu Fuxing and disarmed his troops. Eight of his key accomplices were also arrested and interrogated. After three months, Gu Fuxing was confirmed to be involved in traitorous activities and handed over to the county government for detention.

### Representatives from Dyeing and Weaving Industries in Six Cities and Counties Visit Chairman Yuan of the Yarn Control Committee to Exchange Technical and Policy Opinions

[Report from our newspaper] Representatives from the dyeing and weaving industry associations in six cities and counties, including Shanghai, Changzhou, Wuxi, Wuxian, Changshu, and Jiangyin, namely Pan Shihao, Xu Shunnian, Wang Shaojun, Ma Chunlin, Wang Derun, and Cha Futian, visited Chairman Yuan of the Yarn Control Committee together yesterday. The representatives first expressed their sincere support for the Yarn Control Committee's policies. Then, they exchanged opinions with Chairman Yuan on re-weaving technology and various policies. It is reported that Chairman Yuan stated: It is hoped that the re-weaving industry in the six cities and counties should improve work efficiency as much as possible to set an example for other regions. He also stated that the Yarn Control Committee will set up offices in Changzhou and Wuxi. Other areas near Shanghai that do not have offices will temporarily be managed by the Shanghai General Association. Finally, in response to the representatives' request to issue yarn before re-weaving, the Yarn Control Committee stated that re-weaving factories can be issued yarn first, and the committee will send personnel to supervise the re-weaving. Small factories will still adopt the system of allocating yarn, weaving cloth, and purchasing.

### Yarn Tube Factory Businesses Organize Joint-Venture Company

[Report from our newspaper] Considering that Indian yarn factories urgently need to import yarn tubes produced in China, and in order to promote the overseas market, all yarn tube factory businesses in this city met yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the industry association to discuss the establishment of a joint-venture company for exporting Chinese yarn tubes. They immediately resolved to establish a preparatory office and proposed Zhou Qifan and 14 others as members of the preparatory committee, and appointed Zhou Qifan, Hu Tingmei, and Lu Xuezhai as the chairman and vice-chairmen, respectively, to actively prepare for the official establishment in the short term.

The committee's regulations for cotton yarn and cloth management have been drafted and will be actively implemented soon.

Yarn Prices Fall Back

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market situation saw light trading due to tight credit both within and outside the industry, weak demand from weaving factories, and few purchases from brokerage firms. It was also reported that the negotiated price for China Textile Building's allocation might be reduced, which led to a subdued mood and lower asking prices.

By the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell by 1 million compared to the weekend, to 58.5 million yuan. Other counts of fine yarn also fell back by 300,000 to 1.5-1.6 million yuan.

Cloth Market Mediocre

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw slightly more purchasing from brokerage firms, especially from the Piji Hankou Ningbo and other firms, which absorbed 10-20 pieces. Shanxi firms also made a few purchases, and the market sentiment was positive. However, after the purchases, credit tightened again, and many long positions were sold, causing prices to soften slightly.

As a result, 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth settled at 1.6 million yuan. Colorful Balls rose by 5,000 yuan, while Five Blessings, Yang Crane, and others fell back by 15,000 yuan. Piji Zhigong rose by 17,000 to 25,000 yuan, while other cloths showed mixed performance.

Chinese Stocks Weak in Morning Trading, Recover and Stabilize in the Afternoon

Chinese stocks were initially weak and then stabilized yesterday. Credit conditions influenced the overall situation. In the middle of the session, Yong Yarn Association broke through the 700 yuan mark, making people easily agitated, but buying interest was not completely extinguished. In the afternoon, there was a turnaround, and the market showed signs of strength.

The morning was unfavorable, and apart from Matches, which remained flat, all other stocks weakened. Yong Yarn opened at 715 yuan and 746 yuan and rose to highs of 734 yuan and 758 yuan after the opening. Because there were many offers for immediate delivery, off-market interest rates opened at 30 and 34.5 yuan, and the prices retreated to 710 yuan and 732 yuan. Afterwards, the prices fluctuated and stabilized. Near noon, the market broke through the 700 yuan mark, and many retail investors were forced to liquidate, pushing the prices down to lows of 696 yuan and 718 yuan. The afternoon close was 699 yuan and 725 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, immediate delivery shares of China Flour, Xinyi, Datong, and Rongfeng each fell by 10%. Huaxin, Zhongfa, Xinhua, Qinxing, Xinhe, Meiya, China Textile, China Silk, Matches, Yonggong, Liann, and Innerwear each fell by 5%, and the rest suffered minor losses. Deferred delivery shares of China Flour and Qinxing each fell by 10%, Meiya, Xinhe, and Xinguang Jingfu fell by 5%, and Yong Yarn fell slightly.

In the afternoon market, credit conditions slightly improved, boosting confidence. Yong Yarn opened and immediately rose to 720 yuan and 729 yuan and were bought up to 726.1 yuan and 742 yuan. Then, the prices further advanced to highs of 730 yuan and 750 yuan. At this time, selling pressure emerged, and the prices retreated to 712 yuan and 730 yuan. The closing prices were 730 yuan and 750 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, immediate delivery shares of Rongfeng, Xinhe, Meiya, Huafeng, Innerwear, and Zhongfa each rose by 5%, China Silk rose by 10%, and the rest rose slightly. Deferred delivery shares of Jingfu rose by 5%, and the rest rose slightly. Off-market, unlisted shares of China Bookstore fell back by 5%, and the rest were forced lower by credit conditions.

### Inflationary Trend Slows Slightly

Recently, the inflationary trend of various prices in this city has slightly decreased. According to the Oriental Economic Research Institute, the retail price index of essential daily necessities in this city for the past week (January 12th to 17th) is as follows:

Food category: 119,911 times, an increase of 0.135% compared to the previous week.

Clothing category: 104,679 times, an increase of 0.110% compared to the previous week.

Fuel category: 152,659 times, an increase of 0.141% compared to the previous week.

Miscellaneous category: 227,718 times, an increase of 0.113% compared to the previous week.

Overall index: 144,530 times, an increase of 0.128% compared to the previous week.

In total, among daily necessities in the past week, the fuel category saw the largest increase due to the reduced supply of fuel, followed by the food category. The clothing category saw the least increase because previous increases were too drastic and consumers' purchasing power was weakening, leading to lower sales.

### Record High Check Returns: 848.2 Billion Last Week

The Shanghai Clearing House announced yesterday (January 19th) that the total amount of returned checks for the second week of this year, January 12th to 17th, was 848.2 billion yuan, an increase of 489.4 billion yuan compared to the amount of returned checks in the first week.

### National Bonds Decline, Foreign Stocks Recover Slightly

Public bonds were still difficult to rally confidence yesterday and declined significantly. National B opened at 85,000 in the morning, reaching a low of 74,000, and finally hovered around 78,000. Chengde sold 360 and 520, yarn and flower brokers bought from 503, and bought 550 and 555, with a transaction volume of about 3 million. As a result, compared to last Saturday, A, B, D each fell by 6,000 yuan, and C, E each fell by 7,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks, although weak in the middle of the session yesterday, still recovered easily near the close. Ewo Yarns opened at 540,000 in the morning, retreated to 510,000, and then recovered.

Compared to last Saturday, Xiangtai and Ken Zhi each rose by 5%, Ye Guang fell by 5%, Steel remained flat, Jardine Matheson, Paper, Ewo Beer, Aviation, and Telephone suffered minor losses, and Ewo Yarns, British-American Tobacco, Tramways rose slightly.

### Out-of-Town Cash Flows into This City: Totals Over 700 Billion Yuan

Since the beginning of the month, cash from various cities outside of Shanghai has been flowing into the city. According to estimates from the financial community, as of now, the amount of cash flowing into Shanghai has reached a huge 700 billion yuan, resulting in a severe shortage of cash in various cities outside of Shanghai, especially in North China, including Tianjin and other places. The financial industry in those areas is facing difficulties, and credit is extremely tight, even more so than in Shanghai.

In order to eliminate this drawback, the financial authorities have strictly ordered customs and other sea, land, and air enforcement personnel to intensify their inspections of illegal cash smuggling into Shanghai. Once discovered, they will be severely punished according to the law, without leniency. At the same time, they are also discussing strict and concrete measures to ban it.

Credit Extremely Tight

Recently, credit has been extremely tight. Even smaller banks and firms have been unable to balance their accounts due to their inability to obtain even a few tens of thousands of yuan in cash, resulting in balancing their accounts late into the night. According to the person in charge of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, there are two reasons for this:

In the past, when the Central Bank tightened credit, there were more remittances from various cities in the interior, so credit was not as tight as it is now. Recently, the credit in Tianjin, Hankou, and other places is also very tight, and they can no longer remit the surplus funds to Shanghai, thus causing credit in this city to be even tighter.

Amid the extreme credit crunch, black market interest rates have reached as high as 30%. A small number of banks and firms, tempted by high interest rates, have released surplus funds. However, during a credit crunch, it is often difficult to recover loans, which quickly affects the banks and firms themselves. Under these circumstances, the national banks are working to regulate market needs and will not deliberately allow prices in this city to skyrocket due to loose credit before the Lunar New Year, so that people can safely pass the Lunar New Year.

### Banks and Firms Should Report Details of Their Current Account Holders

In order to prevent banks and firms from abusing checks, the Shanghai Financial Administration of the Ministry of Finance has specially stipulated that banks and firms should submit the addresses and names of their current account holders separately before the end of this month for verification. If the bureau deems that there are suspicious circumstances, it will order the banks and firms to stop opening accounts.

### Business License Fees for Customs Brokers Increased Tenfold

[Report from our newspaper] The Jianghai Customs announced yesterday that the business license fee and renewal fee stipulated in Article 4 of the revised Customs Broker Management Regulations, and the deposit stipulated in Article 5 of the same regulations, will be charged at ten times the original amount from January 1st of this year.

Furthermore, from today until February 20th, is the period for customs brokers to re-register. Customs brokers who wish to continue operating a customs brokerage business must complete the procedures at the General Affairs Section of this customs office within the above deadline and pay the new amount of the deposit and renewal fee to exchange for a new license. Those who fail to do so by the deadline will be considered unregistered and their business operations will be suspended.

### Guangdong Silk to be Purchased at 70% - Production and Sales Association Held Committee Meeting Yesterday

### Rayon Weak and Soft - Factory Transactions and Market Conditions Remain Quiet

The rayon market was weak and soft yesterday. A quantity of 120-count "Rising Sun" brand rayon with luster was traded at 90.7 million yuan at the opening in the morning, quickly rising to 100 million yuan for opening bids. By the midday close, it reached 300 million yuan, with trades at 4.5 million yuan for forward dates. The market was weak in the afternoon. The final price was 100 million yuan, 3 million yuan lower than last Saturday.

Factory Transactions

The market remained quiet yesterday. No transactions occurred for any grade of five-bundle rayon. Asking prices were similar to those of last Saturday. D-grade split-bundle prices were 95 million yuan, E-grade split-bundle prices were 3.5 million yuan, A-grade loose bundles were 3 million yuan, and mid-grade loose bundles were 1 million yuan, with a few bundles traded. Asking prices for dried rayon remained unchanged.

Silk Fabrics

The market was firm yesterday. "Huaqiang" pure silk quilt covers had the largest instant transaction at 1.3 million yuan, closing firm at 1 million yuan for instant sales, and 1.4 million yuan for forward dates. Other silk fabrics did not experience any price fluctuations due to the lack of movement in raw material prices.

### Huainan and Huadong Coal Mines to Ship Large Quantities of Coal to Shanghai

To ensure that there is no shortage of coal supply in this city, the Fuel Management Committee dispatched the head of the Transportation Department, Wu Xianying, to Nanjing to seek instructions from the Ministry of Communications and to contact the Jinpu Railway Bureau in Xuzhou regarding transportation and to inspect the production and coal storage situation at the Huainan and Huadong coal mines.

Wu returned to Shanghai yesterday and told reporters: Train cars have been secured with the Jinpu Railway Bureau and coal is already being loaded in Xuzhou for transportation to Pukou. The current coal reserves at the Huainan and Huadong coal mines are over 100,000 tons, and all of it can be transported to Pukou before mid-next month, then loaded onto ships and transported to Shanghai for supply.

The output and transportation capacity of other Taiwanese coal and small coal mines in Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Shandong, and other places run by private merchants are also being strengthened simultaneously. Therefore, the most serious coal shortage problem in this city can be easily resolved, it is believed.

### Rice Market Active - Coarse Grains and Oil Markets Decline

Yesterday, the rice market situation rotated upwards. Prices in the North City Market increased by 20,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Due to the sluggish market in recent days, speculators decreased, and the floating goods on the market were exhausted. Some owners were unwilling to sell at lower prices, leading to an intention to support prices. Traders who had been observing for many days were also more eager to replenish their stock, and as sales became more active, prices gradually increased. Wuxi white japonica rice reappeared at 1.4 million yuan, and thin rice and early rice both increased by 20,000 yuan. Special grade high japonica rice was 1.44 million yuan, Danyang white yuan rice was 1.51 million yuan, and other indica rice also held firm. The South City Market opened steadily, but after hearing about the rise in the North City Market, the market also turned firm. As a result, early rice and other types slightly increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, while white japonica rice remained at its original price. Yesterday's arrivals were 9,146 shih in the South City Market and 10,571 shih in the North City Market.

Flour continued to decline. The northern varieties lacked demand, actual sales were weak, and retailers continued to sell off stock, resulting in an increasingly sluggish market. "Warship" brand flour was 540,000 yuan, down more than 10,000 yuan from last week. "Old Car" brand flour only decreased by 2,000 yuan due to the scarcity of goods, with limited transactions. Other miscellaneous brands of flour uniformly weakened. Wheat bran rose by 10,000 yuan yesterday after a rapid decline. The factory price for wheat opened at 800,000 yuan.

Coarse grains generally turned upward, with only a few declining. Soybeans lacked demand, and the market was flat and weak. Corn and mung beans were purchased in considerable quantities by Qingdao traders, each rising by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Red sorghum was average, cowpeas were also actively sold in the north, rising by 10,000 yuan. Adzuki beans saw little transaction, and the market was stable. Sesame saw a slight increase, and the price of raw peanuts remained largely unchanged.

Edible oil declined. The arrival of raw soybean oil continued, actual sales were sluggish, and the supply exceeded market demand, resulting in a price decline. Soybean oil fell by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan immediately after the market opened. Except for "Dayouyu" factory soybean oil, which opened at 2.82 million yuan, other factories all opened at 2.8 million yuan, and the market stabilized afterwards. Raw oil decreased slightly by 50,000 yuan, and the market situation was firmer than soybean oil. Jiangbei and Qingdao "Lucky Barrel" raw oil each opened at 3.2 million yuan, down 50,000 yuan from last Saturday. Barrelled cooked rapeseed oil fell by 100,000 yuan, raw rapeseed oil fell slightly by 50,000 yuan, and "Lucky Barrel" small-cart sesame oil was traded at 3.15 million yuan, also down 100,000 yuan. Soybean cake prices remained largely unchanged.

### Initial Drop in Sugar Futures

The sugar market experienced a small correction yesterday due to tight credit conditions. Both futures and spot sugar prices declined.

The association's pricing was as follows: 24 coarse white sugar spot price was 1.75 million yuan to 1.72 million yuan, and secondary grade was 1.7 million yuan to 1.67 million yuan. 20 medium granulated white sugar was 1.72 million yuan to 1.65 million yuan.

Taiwan red sugar was 2 million yuan to 2.15 million yuan, semi-white sugar was 1.71 million yuan to 1.65 million yuan, and grass bag sugar was 1.62 million yuan to 1.6 million yuan.

Taiwan green sugar was 1.4 million yuan. Futures coarse white and cart white sugar fluctuated by as much as 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, recovering 20,000 to 30,000 yuan in the afternoon.

Local sugar was quoted at 1.6 million yuan, Hainan red sugar was 1.65 million yuan, Xinghua white sugar was 1.72 million yuan to 1.7 million yuan, and sugar was 1.635 million yuan.

### Tea Market Transactions Limited

Since the price surge in the tea market has been expanding continuously, the market yesterday was characterized by sellers hoarding and trying to sell at high prices. Although the urge to do so continued unabated, buyers were deterred by the high prices and adopted a wait-and-see attitude.

Throughout the day, transactions were not as active or vibrant as last week, but there was a hidden firmness in the market. Due to variations in the quality of the goods, there was no significant price increase, but the base remained solid.

### Cigarettes Initial Firmness Followed by Decline

Yesterday, the cigarette market saw buyers initially taking advantage of low prices to absorb stock, with robust sales. Prices rose in a roundabout manner. In the afternoon, due to news of goods being distributed, dealers had tight positions and sold off a lot at high prices. As a result, the final prices of the top ten "Great Britain" and "Old Knife" cigarettes continued to decline by 100,000 to 300,000 yuan compared to the weekend. In addition, the prices of various Chinese and foreign cigarettes also mostly decreased with only a few increases.

Soap Flat and Weak

In the daily necessities soap market, due to the reduction in fixed allocation quotas, dealers strengthened their absorption, and there was an urgent need to cover short positions. New buyers also became active. As a result, "Fixed Capital" soap rebounded by 5,000 yuan compared to the weekend, "Arrow Knife" soap declined by 20,000 yuan, "Huang Xiangmao" soap increased by 10,000 yuan, and the rest were flat and weak. Old miscellaneous brands of matches were down by 100,000 yuan. Kerosene and candles showed a fair market.

### Woolen Fabrics Weak Customer Sales

In previous years, around this time, customer demand for woolen fabrics was strong. Although orders for autumn and winter goods had already been placed, spring goods continued to arrive. The current situation is different, with few customers from near and far placing orders. The main reasons are that Shanghai market prices have risen sharply, and most have become inverted. Secondly, the internal unrest is not yet resolved, transportation is hampered, and remittances and discounts are related. The heavy cost of capital, high interest rates, and large public and private expenses, making business difficult, are also major factors.

### Traditional Chinese Medicine Stock Scarcity Price Increase

There has been a recent turnaround in the traditional Chinese medicine market, with prices for goods from Niuzhuang, Tianjin, and Sichuan mostly rising. The reason is that wholesale merchants in various places have weak inventory levels, and customers are searching for goods. Shanghai stocks are also scarce, and the supply route is not smooth, resulting in a situation where demand exceeds supply. The market is expected to continue to rise. If the New Year's "Red Sound" period arrives, the market situation should be even more bullish.

Recently, Fleshy Maple suddenly jumped by 44,000 yuan, and the market is searching for goods. Forsythia is 2.8 million per pair, a very strong upward trend. Laiyang Ginseng is 18 million on the Shanghai large bundle market, and is still active, while small bundles are not available.

### On "Sincerity"

— Impartiality

The Essence of "Sincerity"

Zhu Xi said: "Why was the Doctrine of the Mean written? Zisi was concerned that the Way would be lost and not transmitted, so he wrote it" (Preface to the Doctrine of the Mean). Whether the Doctrine of the Mean was truly written by the sage's grandson Zisi is something I do not have time to discern. Examining its content, it was written by Confucian scholars during the transition from the Qin to the Han Dynasties. Its intention was to transmit the teachings of their master Confucius, which is undoubtedly the case. Confucian thought had reached its culmination at this point. His disciples compiled the entire system into a book to benefit future generations. Therefore, the book begins with the Way of Heaven and ends with edification. All the problems it addresses, such as ontology, cosmology, ethics, politics, and education, often reveal the ultimate principles, paving the way for future generations. Summarizing its teachings, everything is connected by "Sincerity." Therefore, "Sincerity" is the main thread of the entire book. Understanding this will lead to a more than half-understanding of the meaning of this book. Regardless of my shallowness, I have compiled the words on "Sincerity" and explored their meaning to engage with scholars.

"Sincerity is the Way of Heaven." The Way of Heaven is nothing but truth. Therefore, "Sincerity" is simply truth. This truth can be known and practiced by people. Therefore, it continues by saying: "To realize sincerity is the Way of Man." "To realize sincerity" is like seeking truth. It is not only about seeking it, but all thoughts and actions should also be based on it as a standard. This is the way to be human, hence it is called "The Way of Man." Truth comes from Heaven, and people can know and use it as a standard because it shares the same source as the way followed by all things. The Way of Heaven is nothing but truth, and human thoughts and actions, as well as the movement and stillness, formation and destruction of things, are all encompassed by the Way of Heaven and are part of truth. This is the unity of Heaven and Man, and the commonality of all beings. The reason why people can know Heaven and Earth and all things is precisely because Heaven, Earth, and all beings originally belong to one entity. This is the foundation for the generation of knowledge, the key to its existence, and what Confucian scholars throughout the ages have tacitly agreed upon.

The Way of Man comes from the Way of Heaven. The "Sincerity" of the Way of Man originates from the "Sincerity" of the Way of Heaven. Therefore, ethics, politics, and education are the Way of Heaven manifested in human affairs, and the "Sincerity" of the Way of Heaven is seen in human affairs. Is this not the "consistent" Way that Confucian scholars speak of?

Then, where does the "Sincerity" of the Great Way come from? It says: "Sincerity is self-completion; and the Way, self-direction." "Sincerity is self-completion" means that truth is inherently truth, and it brings itself into being without being made so. This speaks of the inherent nature of the Way of Heaven, which is static. Then it says "The Way, self-direction," which speaks of its activation and flow, which is dynamic. "Self-direction" means that its activation and flow are natural, and there is nothing outside of this Way that directs or controls it. The Way of Heaven is like "Sincerity," which is the order that all things follow without fail. This is the essence of the universe, and its activation and flow are purely natural. The universe and all things originate from nature, and their movement, stillness, formation, and destruction all follow the laws of nature. There is no supernatural master who sets the stage for creation before the beginning and holds the reins of evolution after the beginning. If one insists on the existence of a master, then it must be said that it resides within the universe and all things, and the universe and all things are its manifestations. The so-called "Way" is its self-creation, self-preservation, and the inevitable laws of nature. From this, it can be seen that our Confucian ontology and cosmology are closer to Western naturalism and pantheism. As for its view of life, which emphasizes contentment and acceptance of fate, it is a natural consequence of the naturalistic and pantheistic ontology and cosmology, and it also coincides with Western determinism.

"Sincerity" is the essence. The essence activates and flows to form the universe and all things. Therefore, it is said: "Sincerity is the end and the beginning of things; without sincerity, there would be nothing." "Sincerity" is the ultimate Way and principle of Heaven and Earth. The reason why things are things is that they all receive the ultimate Way and principle of Heaven and Earth as their order and boundaries. Therefore, it is said: "Without sincerity, there would be nothing." Furthermore, the formation of things has its reasons, and its destruction also has its causes. These reasons and causes are none other than the ultimate principles of Heaven and Earth. Therefore, it is said: "Sincerity is the end and the beginning of things."

In humans, "Sincerity" becomes nature and virtue. Fully developing one's virtue leads to becoming a complete person, and extending one's virtue to others leads to the completion of things. The Doctrine of the Mean says: "Sincerity is not only about completing oneself, but also about completing things. Completing oneself is benevolence; completing things is wisdom; these are the virtues of nature." The "Sincerity" of the Way of Heaven is bestowed upon humans and becomes their nature and virtue. Virtue is what makes a person human, and if virtue is lacking, one cannot become a complete person. "Sincerity" is like "realizing sincerity," which means seeking sincerity and establishing sincerity. Seeking sincerity is for understanding the principles of Heaven and Earth and knowing how much of this Way and principle one has received. Establishing sincerity is for preserving what one has received from Heaven as a human being, ensuring that nothing is lost. If one can do this, one will naturally become a complete person. Things and I are both created by Heaven and Earth, like siblings. Siblings share the same parents, which is a small division. Things and I share the same Heaven and Earth, which is a large division. Things and I depend on each other for existence, just as siblings depend on each other for life. Therefore, having completed oneself, one must also have a way to complete things. Therefore, it is said: "It is not only about completing oneself, but also about completing things." Completing oneself leads to becoming a person. Benevolence is the virtue of a person. Therefore, it is said: "Completing oneself is benevolence." To complete things, one must extend oneself to others. This involves knowing one's own nature and knowing the nature of things. Thus, knowledge is valued. Therefore, it is said: "Completing things is wisdom." Benevolence and wisdom are obtained from Heaven and exist in nature as virtues. Therefore, it is said: "These are the virtues of nature."

### Experiment and Observation

In the first issue of this publication, in the discussion of "The Division Between Ancient and Modern Science," the importance of experiment in modern science was mentioned. However, due to space limitations, the discussion was not detailed. Here, I add a few more words, but I can only speak to a small point of the spirit of experiment.

Experiment is doing something with a purpose, which is different from observation, which is doing something without a purpose. Experiment must first have a hypothesis, and this hypothesis is used to solve a certain problem. Experiment is arranging some conditions to confirm whether this hypothesis works. In the experimenter's mind, this hypothesis can solve this problem. Sometimes, scientists will also use the method of proof by contradiction, that is, using "does not work" to confirm a hypothesis, but the meaning is not very different. The spirit of science lies in not recognizing one's personal fantasies as truth, but in bowing one's head and asking nature for answers. But "what does Heaven say?" Nature is like a dumb person who cannot speak. When you ask it, it will only make "yes" or "no" gestures, or else, it will wave its hands and feet in confusion, not knowing what to say. In other words, scientists must arrange some conditions so that the result is "either this or that," which is the crucial test mentioned in science. Therefore, experiment is like a kind of dialogue, a dialogue between man and nature. Ancient science—such as Greek philosophy—was a dialogue between people.

We compare experiment to a kind of dialogue, which can very well demonstrate the special spirit of experiment. Experiment is not the behavior of humankind alone, nor is it the behavior of nature alone—it is not purely logical reasoning, nor is it purely empirical fact. We interrogate nature, which is human initiative, that is, the subjectivity of experiment. But after the question is asked, we can only wait for nature's answer, where people can do nothing, which is the objectivity of experiment. Experiment is really a unification of subjectivity and objectivity. Some people only look at the subjective or objective side, which clearly shows that they have not understood the essence of the modern scientific method.

Science in the past was translated as "investigation of things." The saying "investigate things to attain knowledge" can be regarded as China's ancient science. Wang Yangming's story of investigating bamboo is a good example. His disciples and he stared at bamboo for three or seven days, trying to investigate some physics, but in the end, they only became physically exhausted and still did not understand anything. The reason is that they were too attached to the objective, wanting nature to speak without asking questions. "Investigating the principles of things," if "investigating things" only refers to "staring blankly at things," this is passive waiting, not active interrogation. This is not a dialogue, this is just a solo performance. What is pitiful is that the protagonist of this solo performance is a mute—silent nature. How can such a play be successful? The Yangming school saw that such a play would not succeed, so they made a 180-degree turn and advocated "the mind is principle," or said "I am nature." In this way, self-praise, self-questioning, and self-answering, the dialogue between man and nature, becomes a person's soliloquy, which is consistent with the spirit of ancient Greek dialogue. The dialogue of ancient Greek philosophers, in form, is a debate between people, but in fact, it is still an individual's soliloquy. From this perspective, ancient science, whether Chinese or Western, is a personal dialogue. The division between ancient and modern science is clear here.

The problem with the Lu-Wang school is that it tends to be too extreme, which makes them fall into difficulty themselves. At first, they only observed, without asking questions, and as a result, they did not get any answers—this is getting trapped in the mud of pure objectivity. Later, they completely asked and answered themselves—this is getting trapped in subjective fantasy. Scientists should be like Ibsen said, "I do not answer, my job is to ask questions." The problem with observation is exposed here. Observation may be doing something without a purpose, and general anecdotal records are like this. When recording, it is doing something with a purpose, but the observation on which it is based is doing something without a purpose. It is just like a person walking on the street and occasionally seeing two people fighting. He looks at it out of curiosity and then walks away. The next day, he is summoned to court to testify. The judge asks him some specific questions, and he answers to the best of his memory and conscience, but how reliable is his testimony? Psychology tells us that it is rarely reliable. Therefore, the materials of observation are often not very good evidence. Furthermore, even if observation is doing something with a purpose, it often cannot obtain very precise principles. The reason is that observation often cannot force nature to give a definite answer. It cannot arrange conditions to make nature give a clear-cut answer. Nature in such circumstances often answers ambiguously. Many people, because of the ambiguity of nature's answers, even advocate not using observation. This is equivalent to the Western proverb, "Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater." In other words, it is not that observation is wrong, but that imprecise observation is wrong. In fact, experiment is still observation—observation under controlled conditions. Therefore, we say that ancient science also used observation, which refers to observation in a broad sense. The observation of modern science is the observation of experiment, which can also be said to be observation in a narrow sense. This distinction of observation fully illustrates the main difference between ancient and modern science.

### The First Year of UNESCO

— Wang Chengxu

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has just held its second general conference in Mexico City. The author knows this newly established international organization very well, from its conception to its birth. When the first general conference was held in Paris in November of the year before last, the author also participated in the plan for the first year of its existence in its old home near the Arc de Triomphe.

The establishment of UNESCO has been more than a year now. It was born to build a fortress for world peace. Its advocates hold great hopes for it. Therefore, the plans that were laid out were almost too much for this fragile newborn to handle. Each of its departments - education, natural sciences, social sciences, literature and art, philosophy, libraries and museums, and mass communication - has drafted large plans, fully expressing fervent idealism.

The head nurse of this newborn is the British scientist Huxley, and its nannies are all experienced experts. In the first four months of the past year, they observed its capabilities and formulated a more practical work plan, which was implemented conscientiously. Let us review its achievements in the past year.

Its first task was to assist in the recovery of education and culture in countries affected by war. It contacted many international organizations engaged in educational rehabilitation and established an International Educational Relief Committee. The donations they raised have reached 60 million US dollars, as well as donations in kind. Although it is new, it has done a lot of work. We can only briefly list a few important things:

Investigating the mass communication industries - news, film and broadcasting - in more than ten countries for their general and technical needs.

Organizing a six-week summer workshop for teachers from various countries in Fêvre near Paris. Representatives of teachers from various countries participated in it, using the power of education to promote international understanding. The work of education is the backbone of UNESCO's work. It launched the World Fundamental Education Movement. In this world where half the population is illiterate, peace is difficult to achieve. In this movement, it edited a book on fundamental education as a guide for implementation. (This book has been translated by the author and published by the Commercial Press.) The Fundamental Education Research Conference held in Nanjing last September was launched by it. Pilot fundamental education areas are currently being planned in China, Haiti and East Africa. Proceeding in parallel with the fundamental education movement is the textbook reform movement. Collecting textbooks from various countries, analyzing and studying improvements.

Sending scientists to South America, the Middle East, and the Far East to establish scientific cooperation centers to communicate scientific research. The Far East scientific cooperation center is in China.

Establishing scholarships to encourage and assist scholars from various countries in academic and technical research.

Holding an international theater conference in Paris to decide on the establishment of an International Theater Research Institute, formulate organizational regulations, and establish domestic committees in various countries to communicate with each other.

Assisting the United Nations Human Rights Commission in drafting the Declaration of Human Rights.

Publishing publications to communicate the actual work of UNESCO.

Establishing contacts and cooperation with international organizations such as the Geneva International Bureau of Education.

Starting the investigation and research of "Art for Education" and "Art for Society."

Proceeding with the translation of world masterpieces.

The above points are not to be seen as plans, but as things that have actually been done. Huxley proudly presented these reports to the representatives of various countries participating in the second general conference.

After reflecting on the past, we must look to the future. What does UNESCO plan to do in the second year of its life? UNESCO put forward the following four points in the general conference:

Improving the educational, scientific, and cultural standards of various countries. Science is a unified human activity, while art and culture are diverse. Therefore, UNESCO is unifying and accelerating scientific research and its application on the one hand, while maintaining the uniqueness of the cultures of various countries and seeking mutual understanding on the other.

The free flow of ideas. This not only refers to passively breaking down barriers, but also actively establishing information and publishing agencies - newspapers, magazines, movies, and broadcasting - in various countries.

Seeking international understanding through education.

Increasing the practical participation of various countries.

In addition, the compilation of the history of human culture and science, the study of the material and psychological factors of war, the comparative study of university education in various countries, and the international significance of family and social design are all within the work plan for 1948.

UNESCO is one of the most successful international organizations after the war. We hope it will fulfill its mission of the times.

### From Philosophy to Politics

— Xie Youwei

——Russell's Autobiography, Part 3——

The fame of British philosopher Bertrand Russell seems to lie not in his mathematics or philosophy, but in his political activities and political thought. He is not a man confined to the monastery. He does not want to talk about his philosophy only in an ivory tower. He has a strong political interest. He grew up in a family with a strong political atmosphere, and his elders all hoped that he would engage in political activities. This, of course, could not but have some influence on him. Therefore, in his autobiography, Russell talks about politics and education from philosophy.

Russell believes that his political interests are second only to his academic interests. Although he chose philosophy as his main work, he could not completely forget politics. In 1895, when he was in Berlin, he carefully studied German social democratic politics. He liked this political proposition because it opposed the German emperor, but he did not like it because it combined Marx's orthodox theory. For a time, he was influenced by Sidney Webb, who was an imperialist and even supported British colonial wars. However, by 1901, he had completely abandoned this imperialist thought. Since then, he has been very reluctant to use force to resolve disputes between people, although he believes that the use of force is sometimes necessary. In 1903, when Joseph Chamberlain opposed free trade, Russell stood on the position of an internationalist to oppose Chamberlain. He also actively participated in the movement to win the right to vote for women. In 1910, he intended to participate in the election of members of parliament, but the matter failed when the nomination committee discovered that he was a free thinker.

When the First European War broke out, Russell was an anti-war activist. His anti-war remarks and writings were quite dissatisfied with the British government. He was eventually imprisoned for a time because of this, and at the same time, he became widely known to the world because of this. During the war, he hoped that this European war could end future wars, but after the Treaty of Versailles was concluded, he knew that there was no hope. Many of Russell's friends sympathized with the Soviet Union, but after he went to the Soviet Union in 1920, he found that the Soviet Union had nothing that could make him happy or worship. He said: "I think the Bolshevik philosophy is very unpleasant, not because it is communist, but because it shares the elements of Western financial giants." He was invited to lecture and lived in China for almost a year. He had a very good impression of China. He said: "I love the Chinese, but the result of the Chinese resisting hostile militarism will obviously destroy many of the authors of their culture. They seem to have no other way to go except to be conquered or to follow the many evils of their enemies. However, China taught me one thing, and this is something that any Westerner who studies China with sensitive sympathy can obtain. China taught me to think from a longer time perspective, and not to despair because of the current bad environment. During the dark journey of the past twenty years, this habit helped me make this world more tolerable." He seemed to have learned the habit of enduring the status quo from the Chinese.

After returning to England from China, Russell had two children. Later, he became interested in education. Regarding education, his proposition is that it is important to find ways to make children happy, and there is no need to have overly strict restrictions. He is not completely in favor of laissez-faire. He believes that the use of force, in education as in politics, is sometimes necessary. The problem is only the degree of difference. However, if we can make children happy, the use of force can be reduced to a minimum.

In his later years, Russell also became interested in history. His view of history is different from Marx's. In terms of philosophy, Marx only recognized that philosophy is the result of social conditions, and did not recognize that philosophy is also the cause of social conditions. This is what Russell disagrees with. Russell believes that philosophy is the result and also the cause. Plato's philosophy is the result of Greek society and also the cause of medieval Christian theology. If only the former is recognized and not the latter, then the growth of the medieval church cannot be explained. His most recent "History of Western Philosophy" was written from this perspective.

Russell is still alive. Although he is nearly eighty years old, he has not stopped his writing. He is still a shining star in today's ideological circles.

The Path to World Government

Recently, scholars, in view of the failure of the League of Nations in the past and the fear that the current United Nations' power is not enough to eliminate war, have advocated expanding the current American federal system to create a world government. In the future, the status of various countries in the world should be like the forty-eight states of the United States, and part of the current national sovereignty should be granted to the world government jointly supported by various countries. When this ideal will be realized cannot be foreseen, but there are already quite a few people who have written books to discuss it. The book "The Individual, the State, and World Government" (published by Macmillan, New York, 1947) by Dr. A.C. Ewing, a famous philosopher at Cambridge University in England, is an example. There are many problems in this, and in terms of the major ones, one is the problem of the world parliament. How should representatives be produced? If calculated by population, China and India account for almost half of the world's population. If based on wealth, industrial productivity, international trade, etc., it is also very difficult to find a generally accepted standard. The second is which of the sovereign rights of various countries should be restricted. Such as the abolition of tariffs, the unification of the international monetary system, the control of certain rare raw materials, and how to stipulate the rights and obligations of world citizens, there must be reasonable and concrete measures to achieve the purpose of establishing a world government. Dr. Ewing inherited the tradition of British utilitarianism and believes that the rights enjoyed by individuals should be measured by what is beneficial to the public. The sovereign rights enjoyed by the state should also be measured by what is beneficial to all mankind. Whether the veto power enjoyed by the major powers of the United Nations should be retained or abolished is a prerequisite for the establishment of a world government.

The first chapter of the United Nations Charter clearly states that the purpose of the United Nations is to maintain peace and security, adopt collective methods to prevent and eliminate threats to peace, and stop acts of aggression. However, the functions of the United Nations General Assembly are limited to discussion and recommendations, and it cannot take direct action. At most, the General Assembly can send an investigation team, such as the recent Palestine issue. As for safeguarding the territorial integrity of Greece, the General Assembly cannot take any action. The power of the United Nations is concentrated in the Security Council. On June 1, 1945, the United Nations General Assembly opened in San Francisco, and the Soviet Union first raised the issue of the veto, taking this as a condition for participating in the United Nations. If a country suffers from foreign aggression and appeals to the Security Council for justice, the Soviet Union believes that no resolution can be made without the unanimous agreement of the five permanent members. In the past two years, the Soviet Union has exercised its veto power in the Security Council as many as seventeen times. In addition, France has used it once, and the Soviet Union and France have used it jointly once. At present, the United Nations can be said to be dim, and many commentators attribute it to the deterioration of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. What is the reason? According to H.F. Armstrong, editor of the American journal Foreign Affairs, one of the reasons is that the Soviet Union has established puppet governments outside its borders. In the view of Americans, this is not necessary, but from the perspective of the international situation since 1918, there may be some reasons. As for the Soviet Union's frequent use of the veto in the Security Council, it has made the United Nations a situation of no progress. Armstrong pointed out that the veto problem is the main reason for the deterioration of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. To evolve from the United Nations to a world government, it is necessary to start by solving this problem. Of course, the road to Datong is not something that can be achieved overnight.

### Great Minds Think Alike

— Tan Zhengbi

Lu Xun's "Qiejieting Essays, Second Collection," Draft 6, contains a passage about the problem of "selections." He said: "What the selection shows is often not the author's characteristics, but the selector's vision. The sharper the vision, the broader the knowledge, the more accurate the selection is, but unfortunately, most of the visions are like beans, obliterating the author's truth... Tao Qian, who was selected by the selectors for "Returning Home" and "Peach Blossom Spring," and praised by the critics for "picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the southern mountains," has really been floating in the minds of later generations for too long, but in the complete works,... In addition to the "leisurely seeing the southern mountains" admired by the critics, there are also "Jingwei carrying small wood, about to fill the sea, Xing Tian dancing with axes and shields, fierce ambition is always there" and other "completely angry eyes" style, proving that he is not floating all day and all night. This "fierce ambition is always there" and "leisurely seeing the southern mountains" is the same person. If there is selection and abandonment, it is not the whole person. If there is further suppression and elevation, it is even further from the truth?" This very alert discussion, when I read it at the time, I thought it was Lu Xun's own opinion, so I quoted it in my post-war revised "Outline of Chinese Literature History" and praised it as Lu Xun's unique vision.

Later, I accidentally read "Kun Xue Ji Wen" and learned that the Song people had already said this earlier, and in Lu Xun, it was just "great minds think alike" with the ancients, but in me, it became "forgetting one's ancestors." "Kun Xue Ji Wen" is a reading note that is biased towards textual research. The author is Wang Yinglin, a famous historian and geographer in the Southern Song Dynasty. Volume 18, on poetry, has a passage that says: "Tao Jingjie's "Reading the Classic of Mountains and Seas" is like Qu Yuan's "Distant Journey." "Jingwei carries small wood, about to fill the sea, Xing Tian dances with axes and shields, fierce ambition is always there." The depth of the sorrow can be tearful." This passage is exactly the same as what Lu Xun said. Weng Yuanqi's note also quotes Zhen Xishan's "Postscript to Huang Yingfu's Imitation of Tao Poetry" saying: "... Ming Dynasty... Wang Shi,... there is the heart of the Duke of Changsha, only because he cannot use his strength, so he... to cut himself off, the words of eating wild herbs and drinking water refer to the Tao Kan who... Ming Dynasty. He was a sky-supporting hero of the Jin Dynasty, who successively put down many domestic rebellions and served as the attendant Zhong Taiwei, military affairs, and was appointed as a general. It can be seen that he was a figure of the times. His story of... moving... is also talked about by... movers. Zhen Xishan's statement that... Ming had such a heroic ambition as Tao Kan is a shocking theory. Although he was a Neo-Confucianist, he was able to have such common sense... Ming, which is ten thousand times better than the pedantic scholars of Zhu Xi at the same time. And his statement is even one step further than Wang Yinglin and Lu Xun.

Therefore, I realized the main idea of my late teacher Zhu Xiangwan, who insisted on the principle of "narrating but not creating" throughout his life of teaching, thinking that what I saw, and I thought I had obtained it uniquely, had often been said by the ancients, so I would rather narrate than create. At that time, when I heard him say this in the classroom, I privately thought it was too pedantic. Now that I have such a thing, I know that heroes can all think alike, but it is not allowed to forget their ancestors, and "creation" is indeed not an easy task. The arguments made by a generation of scholars may not have been said by people of the previous generation. If it comes from the pen of an ordinary person, it will be slandered as plagiarism of old words. Then the same "great minds think alike" is still fortunate and unfortunate.

### Forgetting the Fundamentals

— Wang Baili

I really dare not agree with the statement that calling people who "speak and act in accordance" gentlemen. The reason is: speaking and acting in accordance is originally everyone's duty. If a person's duty is praised with the name gentleman, then everyone is a gentleman. Such so-called gentlemen are not rare at all. Some people say that because everyone is a gentleman, they feel that gentlemen are not rare. Therefore, there are "smart" people who come up with new topics such as speaking against their actions or acting against their words to reform the inherent "bad habits." Sure enough, some people imitate them. As a result, the world is bustling and there are only people who speak and act in contradiction. Therefore, they think that people who stick to their duties are rare. Things are valued when they are rare, so they call people who speak and act in accordance gentlemen again. Although this statement is a bit humorous or satirical, it makes a lot of sense when you think about it carefully. This is roughly the same as the words "consistent quality" on current advertisements. Originally, "consistent quality" is the duty of the factory's products, a matter of course and not surprising. However, the so-called "consistent quality" here seems to indicate that the materials of the general factory's products were originally of the highest quality, but later, when their reputation rose slightly, they cut corners and changed to inferior goods. The advertisers did not know whether they were deliberately joking or what, and gave the general factories a "humorous" note, thinking that the gradual deterioration of the products was the factory's due process. Therefore, when advertising, they specially marked "consistent quality" to call each other, thinking that only this: the deterioration of the products seems to be a duty, while "consistent quality" is unique. Isn't that forgetting the fundamentals? In fact, "consistent quality" is not a rare thing among today's factories!

The above two things are similar to a passage in Yuan Can's biography in the "History of the Southern Dynasties, Book of Song." The biography briefly says: Can was clean and upright and had a demeanor. He once said to people: "There is a country, and there is a river in the country, called the Mad Spring. The people of the country who drink this water are all mad, but the king of the country digs a well and drinks it, and he is the only one who is not sick. The people of the country are all mad, and they think that the king is not mad is mad. So they gathered together to plot, arrested the king together, and treated his madness. Fire, moxibustion, needles, and stones were all prepared. The king could not bear the pain, so he went to the spring and drank the water. After drinking, he became mad. So the king, ministers, and the size of the country were all mad. Everyone was happy. Now that I am not mad, it is difficult to stand alone. I also want to drink this spring!" Hearing this, it is really laughable and lamentable. Lord Yuan thought that if a person drank "Mad Spring," he would definitely be mad. I heard that Guangzhou has a "Greedy Spring" (?). (See Fan Bonian's biography in the same book.) Drinking it will definitely make people greedy. Today, the wind of corruption is very strong in the country. Is it also caused by drinking this "Greedy Spring"! I can't help but feel emotional about it!

### Conflicting Accounts of Yue Fei's Death

— Zheng Guoyi

The "History of the Song Dynasty" does not clearly state how Yue Ewang died in prison, only saying: "Qin Hui wrote a small note to the prison officer, who immediately reported: Fei is dead." The common people are familiar with the narration in "The Biography of Yue," all saying that Fei, his son Yun, and Zhang Xian were all hanged at Fengbo Pavilion. This is a baseless rumor. The Fengbo Pavilion incident is mentioned in "Zhu Jian Hu Ji," which says: "When Yue Wumu returned to the court and passed by Jinshan Temple, Zen Master Daoyue advised him not to go to the pass. Wumu did not listen. Daoyue left him a poem saying: The water under Fengbo Pavilion is滔滔, you must firmly grasp the rudder with a thousand hearts. I am afraid that the companions will have bad intentions and push you into the deep waves. Wumu arrived in Lin'an and was imprisoned in the Dali Prison. There was a pavilion with the inscription Fengbo. He then realized the meaning of the poem and regretted not listening to his words." The above is probably an attachment to the novel and may not be true, but there is no mention of being hanged.

I once collected records. There are different rumors about Fei's death. I will record them separately below, which is enough to provide assistance. "The Wild History of the Imperial Court" says: "Yue Fei's death in the bath was actually due to requesting to take a bath, pulling his ribs and suffocating him. The prison guard Kui Shun carried his body out and buried it in the back of Beishan." This says that he died in the bath by pulling his ribs. "Lin Quan Ye Ji" says: "Qin Hui satirized the officials to say that Fei did not aid Huaixi, and he was dismissed as the Shao Bao Wusheng Ding Guo Jun Jiedushi Liquan Guan Shi. Soon after, the commander Zhang Xian plotted a rebellion, hoping that the court would return Fei, and he would be the deputy commander. Wang Jun discovered his treachery, and Zhang Jun also said it. Hui then said that Fei ordered his son Yun to write a letter to Xian, and Fei was sent to the Dali Temple. The Imperial Censor Zhong Wan Qiyu was ordered to interrogate him, and he blamed Yun and Xian, who were sentenced to death, and Fei was given death." This means that Fei was actually given death, and although Fei was innocent, Zhang Xian had a trace of plotting a rebellion. "Sanchao Beimeng Huibian" says: "On the day of Guiyi, Fei died in prison. His head was displayed as a warning. The people in the market heard of it and were sad and shed tears." Although this does not clearly state how he died, it is said that his head was displayed as a warning, which means that Fei suffered the tragic death of being beheaded after his death. "The Biography of Yuehou" says: "On the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month of the tenth year of Shaoxing, Hou died of poisoning and was buried in a vegetable garden in Lin'an. All those who heard of it in the world shed tears, and even three-foot-tall children all complained about Qin Hui." This also says that Fei died of poisoning. In summary, the descriptions of Fei's death are not the same. It is said that people at the time also knew the truth about Fei's death. (All the above-mentioned books were written by Song people.) The "History of the Song Dynasty" does not clearly state how Fei died, probably because it is difficult to follow. I think that the saying of being given death may be credible, because Gaozong's desire to kill Fei had accumulated for more than a day, so there was no need to avoid it and let Qin Hui bear the blame alone. Since "The Biography of Yue" came out, another saying of being hanged was added, and no one knew about the various rumors of "pulling ribs," "being given death," "being beheaded," and "dying of poisoning." The power of the rumors in the alleyways is so great that it is not surprising!

### Inside a Coffee Shop

— Mao Yi

I recently sat in a small coffee shop in New York when a beautiful girl came in. The head waiter saw her and placed her at the table next to mine. I sized up this newcomer. She was wearing the kind of clothes that every wife likes to wear.

Across the tofu-sized dance floor, I noticed a neat gentleman sharing my concern for the girl. When she looked his way, he smiled at her. The "unclaimed" lady smiled back at him. The gentleman stood up and walked out to the cashier. After a moment, he returned with a bouquet of orchids wrapped in cellophane. The hypocrite wrote something on the back of a menu and then had a waiter send the menu and orchids to the lady. After she read the words on the back of the menu, she sent back a promising smile to the sender. Then, the gentleman walked over to her table, bowed deeply, introduced himself, and sat down.

I heard him say to her, "It's not much fun eating alone. Would you allow me to order some wine?"

I saw the head waiter serving the couple, waited a while, and then walked away.

"I've seen you in town many times," the man continued.

The woman smiled.

The waiter brought the wine and pulled the cork. "Made in 1926," the man said.

The band started playing, and the gentleman stood up, bowed deeply again, and asked if his female companion would like to dance. I admit they were a good couple on the dance floor. As I went out, I passed the head waiter. "What's going on here?" I said to him, "You saw what just happened!"

He smiled. "This has been going on for a long time," he said. "That gentleman is Mr. Coddington. For the past eleven years, on this evening in October, he and that lady have come to this coffee shop and repeated the same scene. Ever since he first saw her here in 1936, they have been doing this. They always book the same table. Once, I asked him what the reason was. He told me that it kept them both young."

"Who is that lady?" I asked.

The head waiter grinned. "She's Mrs. Coddington."

### Between Master and Servant

— Chen Xiang

Recently, the American photojournalist John Florea, who returned from Japan, told a story about his servant.

In typical Oriental customs, a servant is unwilling to disturb his master's peace in any way. Once, Florea instructed his servant before resting to wake him up at exactly seven o'clock the next morning because he had an important appointment.

The next morning, the servant tiptoed in quietly, carefully placed a note on the side of the bed, and then quietly retreated. When Florea woke up, it was already close to noon. He saw the note, picked it up and read: "Mr. Florea, it is now seven o'clock. Wake up."

### Quibbling

— Ji Mo

I have never liked to quibble with others in my life. When I withdraw cash from the bank, no matter how much it is, hundreds of millions of dollars, or as little as tens of millions of dollars, I have never counted them one by one. I put them in my pocket in stacks. Naturally, there are inevitable cases of missing money, but because the amount is small, I just let it go.

However, as I got deeper into the world, I suffered a lot from not being willing to quibble when I came into contact with people in the business world. Assuming that you run back and forth for a certain person to get a batch of goods, which takes a lot of effort. After the matter is completed, maybe someone will invite you to a meal. It is just a casual meal in a very ordinary restaurant. If you are shy and say, "I am not willing to work for you for free, so there is no need for remuneration." The other party may actually say, "In that case, thank you very much, let's be friends." When you think back to the labor of running around during the initial treatment, you suddenly feel like crying and laughing.

There is a friend of mine who has the same temper as me. This gentleman also loves to have an indissoluble bond with ink. Once, when he was the editor-in-chief of a supplement for a friend, he had to write it himself when there was a shortage of manuscripts. He had to write more than ten articles a month, about 20,000 to 30,000 words. After two months, he thought that after the end of the term as deputy editor, his friend would definitely have a considerable remuneration. Who knew that his friend would use the excuse that the newspaper's expenses were insufficient. As a result, this gentleman did not receive a single cent. In fact, nine out of ten literati are calm. As long as you give a little remuneration, they will never quibble, but often even the lowest remuneration cannot be obtained, which inevitably makes professional writers sigh at the "inkstone."

I still remember that at the beginning of this year, this column published an article congratulating on making a fortune, which analyzed in detail Confucius's psychology of rarely mentioning profit but perhaps hoping to make a fortune. However, this article did not mention a word about how to make a fortune. This draft can add a transition to this article. Quibbling may be a way to make a fortune.

### Domestic Affairs and Managing a Household

— Jin Jin

In general, Chinese scholars and officials have a traditional perspective on managing household affairs, considering that governing a household is comparable to "regulating the state" and "bringing peace to the world." Being fair in cutting meat might even be a prerequisite for one day becoming a prime minister. Therefore, those responsible for managing household affairs, even if they don't understand those lofty principles, should at least have read through Zhu Xi's Family Instructions once, since this article is very easy to find. If you really can't find it, buying an ingot of Zhu Xi's Family Instructions ink will also satisfy your desire to thoroughly study it.

However, in doing so, one inevitably becomes more and more distant from genuine household matters. For example, how to cook meat to make it delicious and palatable, or how to utilize empty milk powder or coffee cans, seem to be overlooked when focusing on those grand principles. Therefore, recently, the author, while reading a column called "Housewives' Notebook" in an American Western family magazine, felt that this topic was not easily translated into Chinese. If translated as "Main Housewives' Notes," it seems that such a thing simply doesn't exist in Chinese families. Conversely, if translated as "Household Management Records," it seems too serious. This is because the content of the column is nothing more than recording things like "when a brown or black table has white scratches, you can apply the same color shoe polish."

I often feel that household affairs cannot escape those trivial daily matters. If one truly wants to always associate them with those lofty and impractical principles, perhaps the "household" will not be "managed" well, and household affairs will instead be thrown into a mess.

### Two Gu Tinglins

— Yu Jianhua

In the late Ming Dynasty, there were two prominent Tinglins, one earlier and one later. The earlier one was a painter, and the later one was a scholar. Now, brief biographies of these two individuals are recorded below:

Gu Zhengyi, a native of Huating in the Ming Dynasty, courtesy name Zhongfang, sobriquet Tinglin, served as a scribe in the Imperial Secretariat during the Wanli era. He was skilled in landscape painting, following the style of Da Chi (Huang Gongwang). His family possessed many famous works, and he was also friends with Song Xu of Jiaxing and Sun Kehong of the same county. He thoroughly explored the essence of their art, and thus became a master in his own right. His mountains often featured square peaks and layered, stacked ranges, with sparse trees, naturally elegant and beautiful, thus forming the Huating school. — See Wang Zhideng's "Biography of Gu Tinglin," the "Art and Literature Monographs of the History of the Ming Dynasty," the "Suzhou Prefecture Gazetteer," the "Songjiang Gazetteer," the "Ming Painting Records," the "Silent Poetry History," the "Painting History Essentials," the "Continued Compilation of the Precious Mirror of Painting," the "Collection of Mo Tinghan," the "Collection of Ronghe," the "Compilation of Painting History," the "Biographical Dictionary of Painting Dedications," the "Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Names," and other books.

Gu Yanwu, a native of Kunshan in the early Qing Dynasty, was born during the Wanli era of the Ming Dynasty, initially named Jiang, courtesy name Ningren, sobriquet Tinglin. He was upright and unconventional, and together with his fellow villager Gui Zhuang, was known for his eccentricities. During the reign of Prince Lu, he and Zhuang raised troops to support the Ming Dynasty, serving as a staff officer in the Ministry of War. After the defeat, he escaped and changed his name to Yanwu after the Qing Dynasty was established. He repeatedly declined official positions, traveled throughout the country, cherishing the former dynasty. He visited the Ming tombs several times and later died in Huayin. Yanwu's scholarship followed the teachings of Cheng and Zhu, devoted to the Six Classics, extensively studying national institutions, local customs, as well as astronomy, instruments, military affairs, agriculture, river transport, and other subjects, focusing on gathering substance and seeking practicality, investigating the origins and details. In his later years, he meticulously studied ancient texts, also with a fondness for epigraphy. He authored dozens of works such as "Record of Daily Knowledge" and "Book of Advantages and Disadvantages of the Empire." — See "Ciyuan," "Cihai," and "Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Names," and other books.

From this, it can be seen that Gu Yanwu was indeed a scholar of great renown, but Gu Zhengyi was also not an insignificant figure. Moreover, he was a painter admired by Dong Qichang. Few people in the Ming Dynasty studied Huang Gongwang, but Zhengyi specialized in studying Huang. Therefore, Dong Qichang also studied Huang, and the subsequent worship of Huang by the Four Wangs and Wu Yun shaped the painting style of the Qing Dynasty, which can all be said to have originated from Zhengyi. Those who study painting history should not ignore this figure. However, because of the shared sobriquet "Tinglin" and the relatively close time periods of the two Tinglins, confusion is inevitable, and some people have made jokes as a result.

The first example is Mr. Ye Dehui of the late Qing Dynasty, who authored books such as "Records of Paintings and Calligraphy from the Yuyuan Studio," a poem entitled "Dispelling Summer Heat," and "One Hundred Poems on Painting Appreciation." Lu Lianfu, in his preface to Ye's "One Hundred Poems on Painting Appreciation," praised him, saying that his "spirit is discerning, his collection is rich, and books and paintings are his hobbies. He has seen all the famous calligraphic works and paintings collected in the inner palace, and knows the origins of the Six Canons since the Jin Dynasty, as well as the division and merging of the Northern and Southern Schools from the Yuan and Ming dynasties to the present." Now, looking at his "One Hundred Poems on Painting Appreciation," spanning thousands of years, his vision is high, his insights are outstanding, his memory is rich, and his horizon is broad, truly as Lianfu claimed. However, in the note for the ninety-ninth poem, he wrote, "Gu Tinglin Jiang imitated a small scene by Yunlin, believing that 'ancient literary inspiration arrives and creates, sufficient to be famous in the world.'" I think this painting must be by Gu Zhengyi, whose sobriquet was Tinglin, and not Gu Jiang, whose sobriquet was also Tinglin.

The second example is the modern elder Yu Shaosong of Longyou. He authored books such as "Essential Records of Painting Methods," Volumes 1 and 2, and "Annotated Bibliography of Books on Calligraphy and Painting," whose scope of collection, richness of reading, sharpness of vision, and appropriateness of evaluation can be said to be unparalleled throughout the ages, benefiting later scholars and contributing to the art of painting in no small measure. However, he also inevitably misunderstood Gu Tinglin. In his "Annotated Bibliography of Calligraphy and Painting, under 'Zhu Wo'an's Book Collection,'" he wrote:

"...Furthermore, there is a painting by Gu Tinglin imitating Huang Gongwang's landscape. Gu's painting is already questionable, and the note below says: 'Colophon by Chen Meigong.' Examining the facts, Meigong died in the twelfth year of Chongzhen, at the age of ninety. Tinglin was born in the forty-first year of Wanli. When Meigong died, Tinglin was only twenty years old, and it would not have been possible for him to write a colophon for his painting. Citing this one point, we know that this compilation cannot be deeply trusted. We will list it here for further examination." This clearly treats Gu Yanwu as Gu Zhengyi. Zhengyi studied Huang Gongwang, so why is it questionable? Meigong died in the twelfth year of Chongzhen, so it seems impossible for him to write a colophon for a painting by Gu Tinglin, the scholar born during the Wanli era. However, what is impossible about him writing a colophon for a painting by Gu Tinglin, who served as a scribe in the Imperial Secretariat during the Wanli era?

It is understandable if ordinary people make mistakes, but Mr. Ye and Mr. Yu are experts who have read numerous ancient and modern paintings and have read all the painting histories in the world. Yet, they inevitably had this oversight. It can truly be said to be a lapse of judgment even for the wise, and it further shows that the path of learning is endless, and one cannot be careless in the slightest.

Therefore, I am reminded that there are many people with the same name as mine. There are both men and women named Jianhua. As far as I know, there are at least ten or more. There are also three named Yu Jianhua. One is me, and one is from Taicang. He is a few years older than me and is a strong member of the Southern Society and a famous poet and lyricist. I visited him in Taicang in 1928 and 1930. We even took a photo together. He cannot paint, but I cannot write poetry either. Another one is said to be a student at the Shanghai Business School. Although there are already three with the same name (in reality, there must be more than that), this is far fewer than the fifteen Wu Guozhens.

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 8　Failure is Imminent (47)

Fengsheng wiped her tears and said, "Since he doesn't want me anymore, why should I force him to want me? That's too undignified." Yunqing said, "If you leave in a fit of anger like this, it will only suit his wishes. You can't make it so easy for him." Fengsheng said, "He doesn't want me anymore, what can I do?" Yunqing said, "You can propose conditions, demand money from him! At this critical moment, you must strike first, don't wait for him to set things up before launching his attack. Losing one move puts you at a disadvantage everywhere. In short, men's hearts are ruthless, we must harden our hearts and fight him." Fengsheng said, "How should I fight? My family has never done such a thing." Yunqing said, "Zhu Zhai's intentions are irreparable, you can temporarily compromise and endure, but it will eventually erupt." Fengsheng said, "I see this very clearly. I noticed something was off about his attitude towards me just a few days after we got married. I've been worried about this day and night." As she spoke, she burst into tears again. Yunqing said, "I think it's better for you to strike first than to let him initiate it. We should propose a few conditions, secure our position first, and then watch how he unfolds his plans." Fengsheng said, "What conditions should I propose?" Yunqing said, "Consider what is beneficial to you and propose that." Fengsheng hesitated for a moment and said, "I think in this era, money is paramount. I'll tell him to give me half of all his assets." Yunqing said, "That first condition is a failure. You must know that Zhu Zhai's family does have assets, but his assets are all in his father's hands. He has no control over them. If you propose that condition, he won't be able to fulfill it. You must propose conditions that he can fulfill, so that he can comply!" Fengsheng leaned back and thought for a moment and said, "If he can't give me his assets, what other conditions would be beneficial to me? Help me think, my brain is too slow right now." Yunqing said, "We must strike first, first secure our position. With a firm foothold, we won't suffer losses. First: of course, focus on money, but don't demand his assets, only demand living expenses to support you for the rest of your life. This kind of living expenses, you can voluntarily cancel, but he can never cancel. Second: demand security. The so-called security is that the house you currently live in, as well as all the objects, all belong to you, to be freely disposed of by you, and Zhu Zhai cannot interfere in any way. Third: demand freedom. The so-called freedom is that the divorce agreement signed by both parties does not need to be publicized. You have complete freedom, you can cancel it, he cannot cancel it, leaving room for retreat. In other words, if you have a suitable partner in the future, you can freely marry him. If you don't have a satisfactory partner, Zhu Zhai's responsibility for your living expenses will never end. I think we should negotiate with Zhu Zhai based on these conditions, and see how he responds." Fengsheng said, "Your suggestions are excellent, these conditions are all beneficial to me, but I'm afraid Zhu Zhai won't agree."

### Reply from the Traffic Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration to "A Passenger on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway"

Regarding your letter forwarded by the "Social Services" column of the Shen Bao, we hereby respond separately as follows:

Upon investigation, the current passenger situation on this railway is more than one and a half times higher than before the war, requiring 622 passenger cars to cope. Currently, only 447 passenger cars are available for passengers. If tickets are sold according to the number of seats, it is feared that those who have difficulty purchasing tickets will turn to the black market, so it is unavoidable to sell tickets exceeding the number of seats, but there is a certain limit. To solve this problem, we are now trying to build new passenger cars, purchase old cars, and rent vehicles amid economic difficulties, in order to improve the crowded situation.

Passengers riding in higher-class carriages than their tickets allow should pay the difference, according to regulations.

"Military Priority Cars" are specifically for military personnel to ride in, so as to avoid mixing with ordinary passengers. Since its implementation, both ordinary passengers and military personnel have found it convenient, and order has been greatly improved. To avoid misunderstandings by military personnel boarding mid-way, a small number of seats may be reserved for military personnel in each military priority car, but these priority cars are also very crowded.

If passengers are crowded and cannot board the train, they can ask the stationmaster to sign approval for them to take the next equivalent train on the same day, according to regulations.

### Postal Service Q&A

This Bureau has received inquiries from Mr. Li Xingyan of Linhai, Mr. Wang Yizu of Fudan University in Jiangwan, and Mr. Wu Guangyu of Yiwu. We hereby briefly answer the various points raised as follows:

As for how customs will levy taxes, please inquire directly with the customs.

(A) Since the interruption of the Longhai Railway, the Bureau has temporarily suspended the acceptance of printed matter destined for Shaanxi due to difficulties in transshipment. Airmail delivery has also been temporarily suspended due to the limited tonnage of aircraft. The postage calculation method is as follows: printed matter is 1,000 yuan for the first 100 grams, and 500 yuan for each additional 100 grams; airmail is charged an additional 2,000 yuan for every 20 grams. Each item is limited to 2 kilograms. (B) The acceptance of both airmail and ordinary parcels destined for Shaanxi is currently temporarily suspended.

(A) Agencies should deliver both ordinary and registered letters.

(B) If an agency is found to be privately opening other people's letters, it can be reported to the Bureau. (C) If there is no concrete evidence for the aforementioned report, the Bureau will also find a way to thoroughly investigate. (D) Postal personnel may not open other people's mail, but this does not apply to newspapers, periodicals, printed matter, trade agreements, business flyers, and samples, etc., which are required to be opened for inspection in accordance with laws and regulations. (E) The name of the person reporting can be kept confidential. Investigators have a strict obligation to maintain this confidentiality.
