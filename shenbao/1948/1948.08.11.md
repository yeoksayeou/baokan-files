### Actively Reforming the Currency System; Loan Negotiations with the US Still Underway; New Economic Plan to Be Discussed by Executive Yuan Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] It has just been learned from a fairly reliable source that the total amount of the currency reform loan proposed by our country to the United States is US$600 million, of which US$200 million is to be used to withdraw legal tender, and the other US$400 million is to be used as a fund for the new currency. Negotiations for this currency reform loan began when Bei Zuyi went to the United States and are still ongoing. During his previous return from the United States, Mr. Bei Zuyi made a report on the negotiations. It is widely believed that Li Gan's return this time will also provide a very detailed report. The United States hopes that China will first stabilize its economic situation and must engage in fiscal and economic reforms. It is also hoped that this US aid can be used properly. As for the recent rumors that the currency system is about to be reformed and that Sun Yat-sen currency has already been printed, relevant people here believe that it is still too early to say. Before adequate preparations for currency reform are made, the authorities still do not dare to act rashly on currency reform, but preparations for reform are now being carried out more actively. The new economic plan that will be implemented soon can also be regarded as one of the preparatory tasks for currency reform. [Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] The Executive Yuan's regular meeting will be held on the 11th. The new economic plan drafted by President Weng has not yet been revealed to the outside world as of the 10th. However, it is widely believed that it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion on the 11th so that it can be promulgated to all ministries and commissions for implementation as soon as possible.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Li Gan, a member of the Chinese technical delegation to the United States, came to Nanjing to attend the US Aid Utilization Committee, and successively met with President Weng, Foreign Minister Wang, etc., to report on the loan negotiations in the United States, the procedures for US aid utilization, and technical issues. Having completed his public duties, he returned to Shanghai by military plane on the night of the 10th and will come to Nanjing again by train on the night of the 12th to attend the joint meeting of the US Aid Committee and the China branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration on the 13th.

[Our Dispatch] The Central Bank has decided to establish a special account to store the proceeds from the sale of US aid materials and is negotiating with the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai Municipal Bank to conclude a contract under which the entrusted banks will collect the funds and submit them to the Central Bank. According to a recent strong criticism in the Nanjing Central Daily News of the three banks vying to handle the proceeds of US aid, it was argued that profiting as intermediaries would undermine the effect of US aid in stabilizing prices. However, responsible persons at the Bank of China believe that the funds handled by them are loans of a national policy nature undertaken by order, with interest of only 1.3%, which is only enough to cover expenses. Moreover, the Central Bank can declare the contract invalid at any time if it believes there is no need for it.

### Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction; Both Chinese and American Members Determined; Jiang Menglin Appoints Yan Yangchu as Director-General

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] According to sources, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization will cooperate closely with the recently established Agricultural Reconstruction Joint Committee on technical matters. According to a person in charge of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, theoretically, the organization has nothing to do with the Agricultural Reconstruction Joint Committee. The former is an international organization, and the latter is composed of China and the United States. However, the Food and Agriculture Organization is very willing to cooperate with the committee on technical matters and is willing to provide all advisory assistance. He continued that in the past, the Food and Agriculture Organization had assisted the China Relief Mission in completing 53 agricultural reconstruction projects, such as the tree planting in Baguazhou and Tangshan near Nanjing. The Agricultural Reconstruction Joint Committee was established last Thursday and has five members (three Chinese and two Americans).

### Handling Three Types of Materials; Zhang Lisheng Presides

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Regarding the handling of enemy and puppet materials, US military surplus materials, and Japanese reparations materials, the Executive Yuan has decided that Vice President Zhang Lisheng will be responsible for presiding over the matter. According to Mr. Zhang, it is hoped that the handling of these materials can be sorted out within two months. After all three types of materials are sold, it will increase the national treasury income by approximately US$300 million. This is because the total value of US military surplus materials alone is approximately US$500 million, of which one-third has not yet been processed.

### Interbank Lending Measures; Ministry of Finance Orders Abolition

### US Vice Consul Bach Returns to His Country to Report; Passes Through Shanghai and Talks About the Situation in Dalian; Little Improvement in the Economy, Unemployment Continues to Increase; Freedom of Movement of Chinese and Foreigners Strictly Restricted

[Our Dispatch] The US Vice Consul in Dalian, Mr. Bach, left Dalian by boat on the 22nd of last month to return to his country to report on his duties. He passed through Shanghai and held a press conference at the US Consulate General yesterday afternoon to report on the recent situation in Dalian. Most of the attendees were American reporters, who asked in detail about the activities of the Soviet Union in Dalian, which shows the US concern about the situation in the Northeast. According to Mr. Bach, "In my judgment, there has been little improvement in the economic situation in the past three years. The lack of raw materials and important equipment has led to a continuous increase in high prices and widespread unemployment.

The actions and autonomy of both Chinese and foreigners are strictly restricted. Every Chinese family must hold a registration book issued by the police station, which records the movements of each family member from one city or town to another. If a member of the family wants to stay overnight outside the home, they must register. In the past six months, stricter controls have been placed on Chinese people who want to leave the Dalian area. In the summer and autumn of 1947, many Chinese people managed to leave. At that time, permits were not difficult to obtain, but since then, the control situation has become increasingly strict, and now immigration permits can only be obtained from the Kwantung Police Station, and the procedures for obtaining them are extremely troublesome. At present, Chinese people who are allowed to leave Dalian are only temporarily allowed to go to the phosphorus mining area on sand boats. The purpose is obviously to collect goods from China.

Similar restrictions are also imposed on foreign residents. At present, the foreign residential area is actually limited to Soviet citizens and personnel of the US Consulate. Although I have consular powers, I am only allowed to go to the port area when American diplomatic mail arrives. Obstacles placed at important strongholds on the highway greatly restrict travel in the suburbs.

The social forces implemented by the current administrative authorities make it impossible for Chinese citizens to develop friendships or contacts with the small number of foreigners residing in the area."

Mr. Bach also revealed that there are approximately 10,000 Soviet nationals in the city, including the military. The navy only has submarines and destroyers stationed there, but there are many merchant ships. The commander of the garrison is Colonel Lai Fashijin, who holds local power and is subject to the control of Commander Baolotelov of the Lushun naval base. The mayor appointed by the Chinese Communist Party can only ask about civil affairs.

Editorial

### The Turbulent Situation in Tibet

Due to the visit of the Tibetan trade delegation to the United States, people in the country have begun to pay attention to the Tibetan issue again. Our Chongqing dispatch on the 8th: Relevant parties received a telegram from Tibet on the 7th stating that Sera Monastery, which was shelled and destroyed by the current Regent Rongzeng Daza last April, and Reting Ranhuh, who was murdered, united with Drepung Monastery to raise the flag against Rongzeng because they were unwilling to endure prolonged oppression. The momentum is huge, and Rongzeng is unable to cope, and it is rumored that he intends to resign and apologize. In addition, on the west bank of the Jinsha River, the Tibetan army stationed in Kang is frequently mobilized, and there seem to be military actions. Judging from the turbulent situation in Tibet over the past year, another coup in Tibet is possible. Whether Rongzeng resigns is particularly closely related to the relationship between China and Tibet, so we have to pay close attention to the development and impact of the Tibetan coup.

The political system in Tibet is relatively special, and its political and religious power has always been in the hands of the Dalai Lama. After the death of the 13th Dalai Lama in 1933, the three major monasteries of Sera, Drepung, and Ganden (also known as Gongdeling, Cedeling, and Xideling) jointly elected Reting, one of the four Hutuktu, as the Regent to control all the political and religious power in Tibet. Reting was young and promising, and had progressive ideas. Since taking office, he has eliminated corruption and clarified politics internally, which has won the love of the people; externally, he reversed the Dalai Lama's policy of "being pro-British and anti-Han," stopped internal incursions into Qingkang, and tried to get close to the central government, sympathizing with the motherland's war of resistance against Japan, and repeatedly praying for the victory of the war of resistance and the dead soldiers and civilians. In 1938, the reincarnated 14th Dalai Lama, Lhamo Dhondup, was found near Xining in Qinghai, and was escorted to Tibet with the assistance of the central government. For a time, the relationship between China and Tibet was harmonious, breaking the record since the Republic of China. However, Reting was therefore envied by the pro-British faction, which laid the seeds of disaster; at the same time, the central government also missed the opportunity to win over Tibet's true submission, causing Reting to be unable to support himself and be plotted against, leading to the deterioration of the overall situation in Tibet.

The Reting incident occurred last April. The reason for the incident was that the pro-British faction used the excuse that Reting's astrological signs were unclear in 1942 and persuaded him to retire to avoid disaster. Reting was short of external assistance and was coerced internally at the time, so he handed over the position of Regent to his teacher Rongzeng Daza to act on his behalf, stating that it would be returned after two years. Unexpectedly, Rongzeng, wanting power and wealth, thoroughly eliminated Reting's power after acting as Regent, and arrested Reting and put him in prison on April 14 last year, and poisoned him to death on May 7, exposing his body in the streets of Lhasa. When Reting was arrested, 5,000 lamas from Sera Monastery demanded his release. Rongzeng not only did not accept it, but also sent two regiments of troops to surround Sera. After a bloody battle, Sera Monastery was destroyed, most of the monks died, and a small number fled Lhasa. This incident shows the rise of the "pro-British and anti-Han" forces, and the conspiracy to carry out Tibetan independence.

The situation in Tibet has been turbulent in recent years, especially after India's independence, the situation in Tibet has deteriorated, which is the evil consequence of Reting's death. The construction of the India-Tibet highway, bordering the Kangqing border, obviously has an international background. The Tibetan army's deployment of troops on the Qingkang border, drinking on the Jinsha River, obviously has the intention of internal invasion. The trade delegation's flight to the United States to conduct trade with the United States, obviously wants to establish diplomatic or commercial relations with the United States alone. Rongzeng Daza, as Regent, is responsible for this kind of centrifugal intention. He represents the ambitions of a minority of people in Tibet, and plots to betray the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, which is naturally opposed by the majority of people in Tibet. In particular, the three major monasteries, the center of religious legal power in Tibet, have pure thoughts and love China. They seek revenge for Reting and build peace for Tibet. They will not tolerate Rongzeng's greedy ambitions. Based on this situation, we believe that a new coup in Tibet is very possible, and the movement to overthrow Dongzeng is an inevitable trend. The three major monasteries in Tibet are the beacon of thought for the people of Tibet. They consciously rise up to overthrow tyranny. If their revolution is successful this time, it will be said that the future of Tibet is bright. The current gloomy atmosphere will surely be swept away, without a doubt.

Finally, we would also like to specifically point out that the border defense of Tibet concerns the safety of Central Asia and several provinces of our country. Especially in today's complex international disputes, the government should pay close attention to the changing situation in the Pamirs and the Himalayas; and should further seek good countermeasures to win over the border minorities, or assist the border people in reforming the status quo, improve their living standards, so that they can reach the realm of true local autonomy, and complete the establishment of an integrated national family and a national state.

### I Order Rayon from Italy, Worth Approximately US$2 Million, Part of Which is Imported by Barter

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Information from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce 1: The import of rayon is mainly from Italy, and the amount from other countries is extremely small. If rayon importers are separately entrusted to handle it, it may delay the time and fail to meet the urgent needs of the country. Moreover, ordering from various countries would complicate the patterns and the quality would be inconsistent, making it difficult to distribute the entire quota. In view of this, the Central Trust Bureau ordered Italian rayon worth US$2 million from Italy, but in order to save foreign exchange, part of it was imported by barter. It is said that a barter contract has been signed directly with the Italian side. In this barter contract, in addition to rayon being imported from Italy, China exports tung oil, tea oil, sesame seed oil, rapeseed oil, castor oil, peanuts, sesame, soybeans, sunflower seeds, feeding beans, various seed cakes, camel hair and wool, tungsten (65% content), ramie, 　ramie, cottonseed oil, etc.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] Information from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce: Regarding the operation of rayon factories, China's industrial circles are now beginning to plan and establish them, but no rayon factory has been completed and started operation. Recently, two manufacturers have submitted plans to the Ministry requesting rewards for establishing rayon factories. One is Anle Textile Company, which claims that it is using the latest foreign methods to manufacture, and 80% of the factory equipment has been completed. The remaining 20% of the parts are being purchased from the United States and will arrive soon. Once assembled, it can start production. The other is Zhongyuan Paper Mill, which claims that it has purchased a factory from the United States that can produce two and a half tons of rayon per day, and all of it will arrive soon. As for the recent rumors that Jiangnan Enterprise Company in Shanghai intends to cooperate with American businessmen to establish a rayon factory with a daily output of two and a half tons, and whether Zhongfang Company will participate, the Ministry has not heard of it.

### Kunming Changes Method of Levying Special Donations, Military and Political Leaders and Celebrities Make Donations According to Their Conscience

Various Trade Associations Designate Donations

[Our Kunming Dispatch, 10th] Kunming's special donation for disaster relief has been fraught with twists and turns. The list of wealthy people who refused to donate was previously submitted, but the parties concerned believed that it was unfair and have filed written protests. The work of soliciting donations has also been hindered as a result. It has now been decided that military and political leaders and social celebrities will adopt a method of free donations, that is, after investigating their property, the donation book will be sent to them, and each person will donate according to their conscience. Other trade associations will designate donations. The total amount of special donations for disaster relief in Yunnan and Guizhou is set at 600 billion yuan. Kunming and Zhuzhou will each contribute 250 billion yuan. Gejiu District will contribute 65 billion yuan, and Tengchong District will contribute 35 billion yuan. However, it is felt that the donation amount is too large, and a request will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for a reduction.

### Japan Returns Materials to China Worth Over 10 Million US Dollars, Those Already Shipped Back to China are Worth 3 Million US Dollars

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] Wu Bannong, head of our reparations and restitution representative in Japan, stated that the materials looted from China by Japan during the war and returned to our country are worth a total of US$13.65 million, but items that cannot be valued are not included. Of the above-mentioned materials, those already shipped back to China are worth approximately US$3 million, and the rest are waiting to be shipped. Wu stated that since the establishment of the Restitution Advisory Committee in April, the restitution work has made great progress, but because Chinese people either do not understand how to file restitution claims or the evidence is insufficient even if they file restitution claims, the materials that have been obtained are still far from the expected goals.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th] According to an official announcement this afternoon, China and the Netherlands are the first two countries to receive Japanese electrical equipment materials in the 30% advance reparations. China has received a 6,250 kW generator and its equipment. This generator was dismantled from a naval arsenal in Sendai. The Netherlands has also obtained a smaller 3,250 kW generator from the same factory. The generator obtained by China was manufactured in 1931, and the one obtained by the Netherlands was manufactured in 1926. It is said that both generators are in good condition. The United Kingdom and the Philippines will wait to receive other equipment later. So far, the advance reparations obtained by the above four countries are only machine tools and minor metals and laboratory equipment.

### Japanese Looted Goods are Unclaimed, I Have Priority to Purchase, Far Eastern Commission Announces New Restitution Policy

[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] The Far Eastern Commission today issued a new policy on the return of goods looted by Japan during the war, and gave China priority to purchase goods that are unclaimed. This new directive has been submitted to the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) and has been notified by the United States to all regions previously occupied by Japan but without representatives on the Far Eastern Commission. After the issuance of this order, the Far Eastern Commission's previous restitution directives and the US directive on the disposition of captured Japanese ships have been repealed. The new directive requires the immediate return of assets and ships identified by various countries to the Allied countries, regardless of whether the Japanese had paid any price for these assets through deception, coercion or threats. At the same time, it also asks member states to give the requesting countries the right of doubt under the final principle of generosity. Japan will repair the returned ships as a priority so that these ships are restored to the condition they were in when they were looted. The issue of the return of industrial and transportation machinery and equipment is different. If SCAP believes that such machinery and equipment are necessary for the security of the occupying forces, the return can be delayed, but the procedures for requesting the return of such items should not delay the dismantling and transportation of reparations. Until the authorities have made a decision on any request, the item cannot be designated for use as reparations. Requests for the return of items that have been used for compensation and have been delivered will not be considered. The cost of dismantling, packaging and transporting the returned items to the agreed location will be borne by Japan. The new directive also stipulates that Japanese cultural items and other items that SCAP believes should be returned are prohibited from export. Gold, banknotes and other precious metals and treasures that no country has identified so far will be liquidated in the future. China, Australia, France, India, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom will have priority to purchase in turn. Each country will purchase according to the proportion of reparations allocated based on the foreign exchange accepted by SCAP, and the proceeds will be incorporated into the fund managed by the Allied Powers or other organizations that will succeed SCAP to serve as the basis for credit needed for occupation work, but the entire fund will be distributed to the countries receiving reparations no later than October 1, 1949. The Far Eastern Commission recommends that countries requesting restitution and the countries where the items they are requesting may be located establish bilateral arrangements. The Commission also ordered SCAP to establish an agency to advise the Far Eastern Commission on restitution issues. The agency will be composed of one representative from each of the eleven member states' restitution and reparations groups in Japan.

### Developing Southwest Transportation, Constructing Twelve Trunk Lines, Sichuan-Yunnan-Xikang Border Affairs Commission Sets Five-Year Plan

The required funding will be requested from the central government for subsidies.

[Another Dispatch] The Kunming-Luoyang Highway was previously surveyed by the Fourth District Highway Bureau, totaling over 800 kilometers from Mojiang to Daluo, and 560 kilometers from Kunming to Simao.

### Taiwan's Request for Fertilizer Allocation Resolved, Payment to be Offset by Taiwan's Local Products, Director of Food Bureau Returns to Taipei from Shanghai

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 9th] Taiwan's Director of the Food Bureau, Li Lianchun, recently went to Shanghai to negotiate with the Central Bank, the Ministry of Food, and the US Aid Utilization Committee regarding the purchase of fertilizer and the supply of food. He has now returned to Taiwan after completing his mission. He told reporters today that the goals of this trip have been largely achieved. First, the Central Bank has agreed to allocate 84,000 tons of fertilizer, some of which has already been shipped to Taiwan, and the rest will arrive in December. However, the payment will be offset by rice, tea, camphor, and pineapple produced in the province. Second, since this amount of fertilizer is not enough for distribution, the Ministry of Food was requested to allocate 15,000 tons of soybean cake, which was also agreed to under the principle of barter. In the future, the supply and demand of fertilizer in the province in the second phase of the 37th year and the first phase of the 38th year will not be in a state of panic. Third, since US aid includes 70 million US dollars designated for food, it was suggested that the US Aid Utilization Committee could use part of it to purchase fertilizer and supply it to Taiwan, so that the province could exchange a large amount of food, and it would not be necessary to purchase foreign rice from Saigon and other places, so that US aid could cooperate with self-reliance. The central government has now agreed to consider it. Li is a native of Fujian, and this is his first time visiting the mainland. He described his impressions, saying: The mainland is fertile for thousands of miles, with boundless green fields, and is truly a country rich in natural resources, but it lacks utilization. Shanghai is more prosperous than imagined, but there are fewer producers and more consumers. By extension, the urgent task at hand is to strengthen economic management, which cannot be delayed.

### Wuxi Train Station Gate Brawl: Railway Loading and Unloading Workers in Factional Strife, Causing Disputes and Injuring Sixteen

[Report from our Wuxi office, 10th] Today, a major brawl erupted among railway loading and unloading workers here, resulting in numerous injuries. The Wuxi station's loading and unloading workers have long been divided into two factions, the "Xi" faction and the "Ke" faction. After the victory, the "Xi" faction was sidelined and stopped working. Subsequently, representatives such as Wu Rongshu were dispatched to repeatedly appeal to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration for resumption of work. The case has been pending for three years without resolution. Recently, the business section of the Railway Bureau's Transportation Department summoned both parties to Shanghai for mediation, fulfilling a mediated settlement for joint cooperation, and verbally instructed the "Xi" faction workers to resume work soon. Thus, the "Xi" faction workers arrived at the station at 6:00 AM on the 10th to prepare for work. Prior to this, military police and other agencies had received secret reports stating that a large-scale armed conflict was about to occur, and dispatched a large number of military police to monitor the vicinity of the railway. Simultaneously, the command post invited the heads of various agencies and representatives from both sides to mediate, awaiting a resolution within three days. Around 2:00 PM, the "Ke" faction workers suddenly arrived at the station to work, leading to a brawl, with weapons including yellow stones, knives, clubs, and lime bags used. The situation was quite serious for a time, but it was dispersed after suppression by the military police. As a result, eleven members of the "Xi" faction, including Xue Sanjiu, were injured, as well as five members of the "Ke" faction. The authorities are currently mediating. At the same time, the nearby Xinyufeng Sauce Garden was also damaged by stray stones, destroying oil and sauce vats and causing losses of approximately ten yi.

### No Progress in Kremlin Talks: Soviet Union Proposes Counter-Proposal; Lifting Berlin Blockade Comes with Conditions

[Report from our news agency] London, 10th: According to well-informed White House sources, negotiations between the East and West in the Kremlin remain stalled on how to achieve a quick resolution to the Berlin crisis. It is reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, in his third meeting with the British, American, and French envoys on the 9th, presented a Soviet plan for resolving the Berlin currency issue, and stated that if the British, Americans, and French could accept the plan, the Berlin blockade could be lifted.

[United Press, Moscow, 10th] It has come to light that Stalin will personally approve any overall resolution after the Western envoys and Molotov have agreed on the important details. Observers believe that after US Ambassador Smith and his British and French colleagues finish talking with Molotov, they will meet with Stalin again. The results of the three-hour conversation on the night of the 9th remain strictly confidential. Before reporting to their respective governments, the three envoys conferred at the British Embassy for an hour. It is generally expected that they will meet with senior Soviet officials again as soon as they receive instructions from their governments. If Stalin and the Western governments approve the agreement, the foreign ministers' meeting will only be a formality. However, at present, apart from the length of the negotiations, there is no indication that a complete agreement has been reached. The talks may be limited to the conditions for the foreign ministers' meeting, but it is possible that a complete agreement may be reached in Moscow before the four foreign ministers meet in Paris next month.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 9th] According to reliable sources: The talks between the three Western special envoys stationed in Moscow and Molotov are expected to obtain understanding, cancel the Berlin blockade, and hold a four-power foreign ministers' meeting. The current talks aim to reach an understanding in order to achieve the following goals: (1) Cancel the Berlin blockade; (2) Allow Soviet currency to circulate throughout Berlin under conditions acceptable to the four powers; (3) Postpone the meeting between the Supreme Commander of the Western European Allied Forces and the premiers of the West German states, scheduled for September. The source also briefly described the outline of the Moscow negotiations as follows: During the first audience of the three special envoys with Stalin and Molotov, they studied (1) the possibility of lifting the Berlin blockade, offering exchange conditions, allowing Soviet currency to circulate throughout Berlin; (3) convening a four-power foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the entire German problem. On Friday, the Western representatives met with Molotov and delivered a memorandum, briefly stating the attitudes of their respective governments after the first meeting with Stalin and Molotov. The memorandum did not mention that the Western three powers accepted the postponement of the implementation of the London agreement on the West German issue, but it did mention that at least the meeting between the Supreme Commander of the Western Allied Forces and the premiers of the West German states could be expected to be postponed. It was said that Molotov stated at the time that allowing the four powers to control the issuance of Soviet currency in Berlin would be tantamount to granting the Western three powers the power to control Berlin's economic life, which would undermine the Soviet Union's position. During the third meeting today, Molotov was said to have proposed a counter-proposal, wanting to completely control the currency circulating in Berlin by the Soviet Union, and wanting to postpone the implementation of the London agreement on West Germany. The Western three special envoys discussed the Soviet Union's counter-proposal in detail, and tried to find some revisions. Reliable sources emphasized that the problem is now intended to be based on the specific proposals put forward by the Western three powers after the first meeting with Stalin and Molotov, and the counter-proposal put forward by the Soviet Union today, to find a compromise. The four-power foreign ministers' meeting must be convened after this compromise is reached. As for the outcome of the meeting, the reliable source is cautiously optimistic, saying that because the procedures for canceling the Berlin blockade and convening the four-power meeting are not easy to achieve, the agreement to convene the meeting is secondary.

### Handling the Issue of Former Italian Colonies: Eighteen Countries Offer Opinions; Discussion at the Vice-Ministers' Meeting May Not Lead to a Conclusion

Those who advocate expelling Italy from Africa include China, Abyssinia, India, Pakistan, Egypt, and New Zealand. Ukraine, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia have expressed their intention to have Italy administer its colonies in trust.

[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 10th] The Canadian government has submitted a memorandum of opinion to the four foreign ministers' representatives on the handling of the former Italian colonies. Unless the indigenous people express their willingness to merge with neighboring countries, it will suggest implementing a trusteeship system for the colonies. Regarding Italian Somaliland, the Canadian government hopes that the Italian government will still have the right to rule the area.

### Britain Orders Reporter to Leave Berlin Immediately

However, according to British sources, Mr. Nado had confidential documents from the German Economic Committee regarding the economic situation in the Soviet zone and the Soviet occupation zone.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 9th] "Nado, the Berlin correspondent for the Economic Scholar Weekly, served in the military, is twenty-four years old, and is a student at Oxford University, studying Soviet issues.

During the debate, the two countries accused each other of irresponsible propaganda and responsibility for the lack of achievement in the disarmament talks. Despite Soviet opposition, the committee decided today to submit a progress report to the Security Council, including a statement from the committee's standing committee, stating that successful disarmament negotiations can only progress after the German-Japanese peace treaty, the United Nations guard force, and the control of atomic energy have been resolved.

### The Whole Story of the Friction Between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia Will Soon Be Made Public: Yugoslavia Prepares to Publish Correspondence Between the Two Countries

[Central News Agency, London, 10th] According to Belgrade reports, the reasons for the conflict between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union can be found in the correspondence between Tito and Stalin and Molotov in April and May. This correspondence is said to be published recently in the Yugoslav capital. Judging from the contents of the correspondence, the main reason for the friction between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union is that the former believes that the Soviet Union is interfering in its affairs. The real cause of the dispute was the Soviet civilian and military experts who went to Yugoslavia after the war. In 1946, Tito proposed that Soviet experts withdraw from Yugoslavia. In addition, Yugoslavia refused to allow the Soviet Union to set up its own intelligence agencies in its territory, and refused to allow Soviet conscription personnel to go to Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav government believes that the purpose of the above-mentioned personnel is to "undermine the new Yugoslavia." In addition, the Trieste issue is also related to the conflict between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, because the Soviet Union once pointed out that Yugoslavia was rashly risking the danger of war.

### Moscow Radio Calls for Cooperation Between the United States and the Soviet Union

Today, cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union will guarantee lasting peace.

### The United States and the Soviet Union Have Entered a Head-On Conflict Over Espionage Cases; Pan Youxin Submits a Note Demanding the Release of a Soviet Teacher

[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] Soviet Ambassador to the United States Pan Youxin, after holding a half-hour meeting with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Lovett on the issue of the two Soviet teachers, Sanmarin and Mrs. Kosonkina, whom the U.S. House of Representatives Committee Investigating Actions that Violate U.S. Interests in the Soviet Union espionage case demanded to question, submitted a note to the State Department demanding the release of Sanmarin. Mr. Pan accused Sanmarin of being detained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and demanded that the United States allow the Soviet Consul General to visit him.

Sanmarin and Mrs. Kosonkina are teachers at the school for the children of Soviet officials in New York. It is said that after their sudden disappearance before they planned to return home on July 31, rumors spread that they were "kidnapped" by Soviet officials, and Mrs. Kosonkina was forcibly taken away from the Tolstoy Farm near New York by the Soviet Consul General in New York on the 7th. According to the Consul General, Mrs. Kosonkina and Sanmarin were both kidnapped by the White Russians. Sanmarin voluntarily visited the Federal Bureau of Investigation yesterday and expressed his willingness to testify at the Congressional hearing on the Soviet espionage case. The aforementioned members of the House of Representatives are still demanding to question Mrs. Kosonkina. The State Department immediately denied Pan Youxin's claim that the U.S. authorities were related to the abduction of the above-mentioned two people by the White Russian organization led by Countess Tolstoy. Pan Youxin accused this White Russian organization of preventing the above-mentioned two people from returning home, and said that the U.S. government was involved in this conspiracy.

The United States Protects Sanmarin to Testify in the Espionage Case

[United Press, New York, 10th] The U.S. House of Representatives Un-American Activities Investigation Committee will subpoena Soviet mathematics teacher Sanmarin, who is currently "evading the Soviet secret police political security bureau," and his wife to Washington to testify at the committee's espionage hearing on the 10th. Mr. San is currently in the New York area, and is under the committee's "strict protection." His wife and four children are hiding on a farm in New Jersey, guarded by a White Russian underground organization. Mr. San's refusal to return home has greatly frustrated the Soviet personnel, and the White Russian side is desperately protecting him.

### Discussing the Draft Danube River Convention; French Amendment Rejected; Italy Requests to Participate in the Belgrade Conference

[Central News Agency, Belgrade, 10th, United Press] The Danube River Conference recently rejected the French amendment to the draft convention prepared by the Soviet Union by a vote of seven to three. The amendment sought to establish freedom of navigation and freedom of commerce for all countries, and to place the work of the Danube River Commission within the scope of the United Nations Charter. The French amendment was first discussed among the 23 items proposed by the Western group. The Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Ukraine opposed the amendment because the conference could not change the resolution of the 1946 Foreign Ministers' Conference or the terms of the peace treaties with the German satellite states. U.S. Ambassador to Yugoslavia Kennan urged the passage of the U.S. amendment to delete the preamble to the Soviet draft convention, hoping that the amendment would be beneficial to the peaceful relations and economic prosperity of the Danube River based on the United Nations Charter.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 10th] The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that the Italian government has submitted a note to the Danube River Conference meeting in Belgrade, stating that Italy has the right to participate in the conference. The reason for submitting this note is based on two facts: Italy signed the 1921 Danube River Treaty, and Italian territory is connected to the Western Danube River system through waterways such as the Drava River.

### Little Stalin's Behind-the-Scenes Life (2)

— Translated by this newspaper's translation department

(Original article published in the American "Observer Magazine" on August 17th)

Privileged Existence

Once, Vasily went to Moscow, wearing his full military uniform and medals to see his father, and reported to the Commander-in-Chief in a smart manner: "Colonel Stalin reports to the Marshal." The weary Marshal showed no interest in his son's achievements, only responding coldly: "This is all Novikov's doing. He deliberately promoted you, wanting to use this to win my favor. But remember: unless you truly earn that rank through your own efforts, I will never sign that order recommending your promotion to general."

The Colonel returned to his unit with his head drooping, telling his comrades what his father had said, then resentfully said: "It's really not good for Father to hold such a position. I can't play tricks on him. I can only wait for him to have mercy on his own."

Such a father would certainly hinder Vasily's ambition to seek a general's rank, but without him, Vasily probably wouldn't have lived the luxurious life that most senior generals could only dream of. The Colonel had four exquisite cars imported from Moscow. His food and necessities were supplied by the Kremlin stores, which specialized in providing privileged customers with high-quality wines, canned food, caviar, cigarettes, and shirts. When his unit rotated, his quartermaster found the finest camps for him, arranging large, comfortable beds, snow-white silk quilts, radios, pianos, etc. The exquisite furnishings were far beyond what could be hoped for in front-line life. His clothes were made by his father's tailor, and he often relaxed in the best entertainment venues in the Caucasus Mountains. Only the Politburo members—the darlings of the Soviet Union—could compare with Vasily.

Indulgence and Hardship for Subordinates

However, it must be said that although Colonel Vasily lived a privileged life, he always thought of his unit. He often used his name to call the highest military supply agencies, shouting loudly: "I am Stalin," demanding that they issue Lend-Lease uniforms, fresh food, and warm imported underwear for his air force personnel to use. They ate American pork, fresh meat, condensed milk, cocoa, chocolate, cheese, and white bread in the unit's dining hall, while other units ate millet porridge and stale food for months. In addition, he often helped the families of his subordinates.

Therefore, Vasily was loved by his unit, but because he lacked talent and military experience, they did not respect him as a commander. On the surface, all orders went through him, but the actual commander was his assistant, who came from the same rank as him. Serious work was not entrusted to Vasily because he lacked patience and was extraordinarily disorganized, doing more harm than good.

A large plane carrying bombs suddenly exploded at the unit's airfield. Vasily immediately detained several officers. He repeatedly ordered his subordinates to line up, pacing back and forth with a pistol in his hand, shouting that he would personally shoot the saboteur. A few days later, another plane suddenly exploded. After investigation, it was determined that the explosion was due to defects in the bombs themselves.

[Report from this newspaper] The City Police Department yesterday cracked down on seven private Hong Kong exchange racketeering agencies. The scale of several of these organizations and the amount of money involved broke the previous records of the Lin Wang and San Wei companies.

### Chennault Air Transport Team Violates Regulations, Affecting Business of Two Airline Companies

[Report from this newspaper] After the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) protested to the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) regarding the Chennault Air Transport Team's transport of banknotes to Xiamen, the CAA has yet to provide a formal response. However, the responsible officials of the Ministry of Transportation have indicated that they will urge the Chennault Air Transport Team to operate flights on certain designated routes in the future to avoid hindering the business of CNAC and the Central Air Transport Corporation (CATC). It is reported that the designated flight routes for the Chennault Air Transport Team include the Shanghai-Lanzhou, Ping-Sui, and Sui-Ning lines, but these routes are relatively remote and have little passenger or cargo traffic. Therefore, the team rarely operates these flights and instead develops routes that already have scheduled flights operated by CNAC or CATC, greatly affecting the business of the two airline companies.

### Civil Aeronautics Administration Statement, No Violation of Contract

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The Ministry of Transportation's Civil Aeronautics Administration issued a statement regarding the Xiamen banknote transport case: (1) The contract signed between the Civil Air Transport (CAT) and the government stipulates that the team can freely fly and operate unscheduled passenger, cargo, and mail transport between all civil airports. Article 13 of the contract states that when the Civil Air Transport team operates unscheduled routes for the transport of passengers, cargo, and mail, it may use the following designated airports in addition to using airports on scheduled routes: A, airports under the jurisdiction of the CAA, and B, military airports (airport names are simplified). Xiamen falls under the jurisdiction of the CAA, and this flight is therefore legal. (2) The authority to determine whether passengers carrying banknotes in their luggage violates regulations and how to restrict it falls under the jurisdiction of other competent authorities.

### Financial Control Bureau Strengthens Inspection, Adds Ten Audit Teams

Director Lin Discusses Restrictions on Check Usage

[Report from this newspaper] It is reported that in order to strengthen the inspection of financial institutions, the number of auditors in the city's Financial Control Bureau will be expanded from the current ten teams to twenty teams. At the same time, ten teams of Central Bank personnel will be used as a reserve force, ready to be fully deployed when necessary. Furthermore, after the Financial Control Bureau inspected financial institutions last week, it was found that the operations of some institutions exceeded the normal scope. An announcement will be made once the review is completed.

[Additional News] Financial Control Bureau Director Lin stated: The purpose of restricting the same-day use of checks is to suppress credit expansion and should be implemented in accordance with the government's established policy. However, during implementation, the lack of cash, the prevalence of cashier's checks, and the premium on large denomination banknotes are unavoidable adverse phenomena. In the future, as the cash shortage situation improves, these signs may disappear. Furthermore, the inspection of financial institutions will continue to be carried out. Recently, a few institutions have been found to have unsound operations, and they will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

### Hotel Industry Requests Price Increase, Compiles Cost Survey Form, Salaries and Wages are the Largest Item, Nearly 46%, Social Affairs Bureau to Draft Methods for Adjusting Room Rates

[Report from this newspaper] The city's hotel industry previously submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau to increase prices. The Social Affairs Bureau did not approve the request, as prices had just been increased recently. However, it instructed the industry to compile a percentage breakdown of various hotel costs, and after assessing the various expenditures, a decision would be made on how much to increase room rates. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a temporary evaluation meeting with approximately 30 representatives from the City Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, and hotel labor and management to discuss this issue. Based on data obtained from 20 hotels, including the Dalu, Dongfang, Yangzi, Nanjing, and Jue Lu hotels, a cost survey form for April, May, and June of the 1948 League of Hotel Companies in Shanghai was compiled. Among them, salaries and wages accounted for 45.71% (based on the cost of living index), food accounted for 5.68% (based on medium-quality rice and vegetable oil), fuel accounted for 8.37% (based on white coal), textiles accounted for 5.08% (based on Longtou broadcloth), daily necessities accounted for 3.21% (based on soap), decoration accounted for 4.19%, additions accounted for 2.07% (both based on foreign nails, cement, and foreign pine), laundry accounted for 1.57% (based on prices published by the Laundry Industry Association), stationery accounted for 1.05% (based on newsprint and ink), miscellaneous items accounted for 4.91% (based on the cost of living index), public utilities accounted for 13.45%, taxes accounted for 2.43%, and rent accounted for 1.55%. Based on the percentages obtained from the above survey, the Social Affairs Bureau will draft a calculation method to facilitate the adjustment of hotel room rates. This method will be presented at the evaluation meeting to be held on the 16th of this month for discussion.

### Private Shipping Companies Do Not Stop at the Capital, Due to Too Many Ticketless Passengers, Authorities are Discussing Remedial Measures

According to shipping industry news: The Ministry of Transportation recently ordered the Maritime Affairs Bureau and the Shipping Industry Association to ensure that all private shipping companies stop at Nanjing, as Nanjing is not a stop for ships of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, resulting in especially crowded conditions for passengers awaiting transport. However, private companies consider that there are too many ticketless passengers in the capital, and they act collectively. As soon as the ship docks, they swarm aboard, and the military police maintaining order on the dock cannot stop them. After these people board, they not only travel without tickets but also seize cabins,搶飯搶菜, and commit assault against the crew. As a result, passengers who actually pay for tickets cannot receive the treatment they are entitled to, and they complain to the shipping companies. In addition, the number of passengers that ships can carry is regulated by the Maritime Affairs Bureau. If they carry too many passengers, the shipping companies bear greater responsibility in the event of an accident. Therefore, before the security authorities in the capital have effective measures to prevent ticketless passengers, private companies remain hesitant to try stopping there and insist that the Ministry of Transportation provide a concrete guarantee before complying with the order. The Ministry of Transportation is currently in consultation with the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense and the Capital Police Department.

### Difficulties Faced by Two Railway Bureaus, Selling One Ticket, Counting Money Takes One Minute

The Jin-Hu Railway Bureau is currently facing a major difficulty, namely the extremely large amount of time wasted counting banknotes when purchasing tickets. On average, the time spent counting banknotes for each ticket requires one minute. According to the railway bureau's regulations, tickets must be sold two hours before the train departs. Within two hours, only 120 tickets can be sold. This is not only inconvenient for passengers, but also has a huge impact on the railway bureau's own operating income. The railway bureau considered using cashier's checks to purchase tickets, but concluded that forgeries would inevitably be discovered in large numbers, making implementation difficult. Currently, in order to alleviate the difficulty of selling tickets, in addition to opening more ticket windows, two points are being considered: (1) Various institutions, organizations, companies, and factories can sign agreements with the bureau in advance, and when purchasing tickets, they can use cashier's checks stamped with the company's seal; (2) Please ask passengers to make full use of telegrams to purchase tickets. Whether the first item will be implemented is currently under serious consideration.

### High-Speed Train Departs for Shanghai This Morning, For the Fourth Test Run

[Report from this newspaper] Since the air-conditioned high-speed train of the Jin-Hu Railway Bureau left the factory last month, the air-conditioning equipment has repeatedly experienced obstacles. Recently, it was heard that after the engineers of the Qishuyan Machine Factory carefully studied the results, the difficulties with the air-conditioning device have gradually been overcome. A short-distance test run was conducted between Zhenjiang and Qishuyan some days ago. Although there were still some areas that were not as ideal, there was significant progress compared to before. It was further improved after returning to the factory. Xie Zhen, Deputy Director of the Railway Bureau and Director of the Transportation Department, personally went to Qishuyan yesterday morning to inspect it. Yesterday, news came from the Qishuyan Factory that the high-speed train will be driven to Shanghai by Deputy Director Xie himself this morning for the fourth test run. Whether a full Jin-Hu test run will be conducted again depends on the results of this morning's test run. It is generally expected that this test run will not encounter any more obstacles as before.

### Students Donate Generously to Scholarship Fund

On May 22nd of this year, this newspaper's local edition published a news item that American automotive merchant Mr. and Mrs. Kirk, in memory of their only son, Mike, who was killed in action in France, specifically funded their former Chinese friend, Mr. Xu Jingdao, to study in the United States. Recently, according to Mr. Xu Guifu, Xu's father, after his son arrived in the United States and after several months of tutoring, he has been admitted to Harding College to study. Because he is concerned about the difficult situation and education loss for young people in his motherland, he donated his usual savings of five U.S. dollars to this newspaper's "Reader Scholarship Fund", and hopes that all Chinese students in the United States can节俭开支, save on expenses and help young people in their motherland. This is also a great story in the scholarship movement.

### Factory Takeover, Complications Arise, Inciting Workers to Use Violence, Creditors Accused of Two Crimes

[Report from this newspaper] Tan Tiecheng from Changzhou and Xu Wenji from Cixi are representatives of the unsecured creditor group of the Xin Kang Flour Mill in this city. On December 19th, 1946, they signed a settlement record with Zhu Meisun, the owner of the factory. On the 30th of the same month, Xu and Tan went to take over the factory in accordance with the provisions of the first item of the record. However, the workers remaining in the factory refused to hand it over because they had not received notice from the factory owner. In March 1947, Xu and Tan went to take over for the second time, but there were no results. On August 10th, Zhu sent a letter agreeing to resolve the matter within seven days, and stated that if there was another delay, he would, in accordance with the provisions of the seventh item of the settlement record, allow the creditor group to freely dispose of all collateral. However, Zhu did not fulfill the agreement when the deadline arrived. On the 20th of the same month, both parties signed a new settlement contract, converting the debt into 1.4 billion national currency units, with 20%, or 280 million yuan, to be paid first on September 30th, and the remainder to be paid in installments. Unexpectedly, the check bounced upon maturity. On October 2nd of the same year, Xu and Tan, feeling extremely angry that Zhu had failed to fulfill both the old and new contracts, invited Sun Zhongxuan, a judicial section member from the Yulin Road Police Station, and three men with guns to go to the factory and forcibly take it over. The two sides insisted until 9:00 PM, but the matter was still not resolved. Xu and Tan then incited the factory workers to use violence, injuring Zhu and others. Afterwards, Zhu reported the incident to the police, and Xu and Tan were arrested and sent to the local prosecutor's office to be dealt with according to law. The prosecutor's office has concluded the investigation of the case and has filed public charges of obstructing freedom and assault.

Eighty grams of opium were found in the handbag of a fashionably dressed female passenger, Liang Xiudi. After being caught, Liang's face turned pale, and she hurriedly argued that the opium was being taken to her godmother for her godmother to quit smoking, and that she did not smoke herself, and requested a test. Liang and the eighty grams of opium were transferred by the customs to the police station for interrogation.

### Emergency Grain Purchase and Storage Committee, Officially Established in Shanghai, Coordinating with U.S. Aid to Systematically Supply Civilian Food

The Emergency Grain Purchase and Storage Committee, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Food, has been officially established in Shanghai, and Director Yang Chuo'an has also taken office. The committee's task is to coordinate with U.S. aid to supply food to urban residents, so that the already successful rationing work can continue smoothly. It is reported that U.S. aid food worth 70 million U.S. dollars is currently arriving in batches and being transferred by the China Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration to our side for processing. This food is designated for rationing to the five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou for nine months, but the amount is only sufficient for 40% of the total needs. How to control the remaining 60% in order to coordinate with U.S. aid is a matter of deep concern to the government. It is felt that there should be an organization responsible for this and that the funds for purchasing grain should be systematically planned. This is the motivation for establishing the committee. From now on, for urban grain rationing, our country will raise 60% of the grain itself, estimated to be about 500,000 tons. In addition to one-fifth of the grain that the committee has ordered from abroad, the committee has decided to entrust existing government agencies with experience, such as the Agricultural Bank of China and the Cooperative Bank, to purchase, transport, and store grain in domestic production areas to supply to the city's food distribution agencies for rationing to the citizens. It is generally believed that after the establishment of the committee, there will be no concern about the source of rationing grain, and urban residents will be guaranteed a reliable food supply.

### Council Committee Resolves Public Utility Pricing: New Calculation Standards to be Established; Automatic Adjustment Formula to be Abolished; Further Discussion at Tomorrow's Meeting

[Report from this Newspaper] The Public Utilities Research Committee of the Municipal Council continued its meeting yesterday morning. Attending councilors included Fei Shusheng, Li Wenjie, Jiang Hao, Wang Zhuyi, Xu Xueyu, Yan Esheng, Shui Xiangyun, Qu Yue, Zhang Zhongyuan, Shao Yongsheng, and others. The Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Director Zhao, was also present. Councilor Jiang Hao served as chairman. During the meeting, further examination was made of the issue of price increases for public utilities, and relatively concrete improvement methods were proposed. After synthesizing the opinions offered by various councilors, the following six points were summarized as review opinions. The Public Utilities Committee will convene again on the 12th to submit the review opinions from yesterday's committee meeting for discussion and to determine the date for convening a temporary general meeting. The six review opinions decided yesterday are recorded below:

(1) Request the Municipal Government to immediately abolish the automatic adjustment formula for public utility prices.

(2) Request the Central Government to exempt tariffs and surcharges on oil used by public utilities.

(3) Request the Central Government to pre-settle or pre-purchase foreign exchange and coal needed for all materials and oil supplies required by public utilities for three months at a time, and thereafter settle and purchase on a quarterly basis.

(4) All oil supplies and equipment accessories that can be supplied from US aid materials should be calculated at the lowest price. In addition to requesting this from the Central Government, the Municipal Government is also requested to directly negotiate with the US Aid Utilization Committee.

(5) Request the Central Bank to continue providing monthly loans.

(6) Starting from September, after the original formula is abolished, request the Public Utilities Bureau to establish new calculation standards based on the following principles. The principles for the calculation standards are as follows:

Explanation: Because the public utility price calculation formula was originally established by the National Economic Council and has been revised. Taking the electricity price calculation formula as an example, the base number for business expenses per kilowatt-hour was incorporated into the local metal material price index, originally only at 10%, but was later revised to 60% for the cost of living index and 40% for the metal index, which is obviously unreasonable. If it continues to be adopted, it will only increase the unreasonable burden on citizens and must be stopped. Therefore, it is proposed to use the following principles as temporary standards for calculating public utility prices:

Eight Principles as Pricing Standards

(1) The base number for oil, coal, materials, and equipment should be calculated based on the actual average index from January to June of this year. For example, the coal usage base per kilowatt-hour (average number from January to June this year) multiplied by the average coal price, the oil usage base per kilowatt-hour (average number from January to June this year) multiplied by the average oil price, the material maintenance cost per kilowatt-hour (items of a capital expenditure nature should be eliminated, and the cost must be calculated based on a weighted average method) multiplied by the monthly metal price index compiled by the Municipal Government, and so on.

(2) Dividends and interest should not be calculated in US dollars.

(3) The cost of living index for staff should be calculated based on the average of the two times of the previous month and should not be pre-added. (For example, the base salary of staff per kilowatt-hour (January to June this year) multiplied by the average of the upper and lower months of the previous month for the workers' cost of living index).

(4) The amount of tax should be calculated based on the total cost, and then the tax rate percentage.

(5) The metal index should be calculated based on the average of the four weeks of the previous month, and should not be calculated based on the black market price, and should not be subject to additional taxes.

(6) Business expenses should be reduced. For example, the depreciation expense per kilowatt-hour should not be calculated for machines not in use. Taking electricity as an example, that is, the other expenses that should be borne per kilowatt-hour should be based on the actual expenses of the previous month, minus the cost of coal, oil, material maintenance, depreciation, and staff salaries. However, the expenditure for the offsetting of dividend foreign exchange liabilities is not included. The actual expenditure should be disclosed, and the Public Utilities Bureau should carefully review it.

(7) Foreign staff and senior staff should be paid the same as other employees and should not be treated excessively favorably.

(8) The labor base number should be calculated based on the average from January to June of this year.

In addition, regarding the number of foreign staff and their actual income, please ask the Public Utilities Bureau to investigate and announce it.

### Direct Tax Bureau Lays Off Over a Hundred People

Laid-off Personnel to Discuss Countermeasures Today

### Regulations on the Prohibition of Opium and Drugs Expire; District Court Temporarily Suspends Adjudication of Drug Cases

The Regulations on the Prohibition of Opium and Drugs, promulgated and implemented by the government on August 2, 1946, expired on August 2 of this year. Because the new regulations have not yet been promulgated, the district court has suspended the hearing of opium and drug cases accepted from the 3rd, awaiting new orders. The Wang Zhibin drug trafficking case has also been postponed as a result.

### Cement Exports Should be Given Foreign Exchange; Adjustment to 60% Approved

[Report from this Newspaper] The Cement Industry Association states that domestic construction is currently stalled, and cement sales are decreasing. If sales are not promoted abroad, the production of various factories will be difficult to maintain. In the first half of this year, Taiwan and other companies exported 32,200 tons to the Dutch East Indies. However, in the past one or two months, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Japan have been dumping cement in Southeast Asia. For domestic cement exports, the government has limited the foreign exchange provided to 55% to supply raw material imports. According to the situation a month ago, the Free on Board (FOB) price per ton of exported cement was about US$16, only 65% of the manufacturing cost, making it impossible to compete with American, Soviet, and Japanese merchants. Therefore, representatives such as Chen Fanyou were dispatched to visit Director Huo of the Export Control Committee and Director Chen of the Export Promotion Office to explain the difficult situation and request that the limited percentage of foreign exchange provided be increased to increase raw material imports. It is reported that Director Huo has agreed to adjust the ratio from 55% to 60%.

### Damaging the Reputation of the Principal by Posting Flyers; School Director Sued

[Report from this Newspaper] Dai Zhengqing, a school director of the Jianghuai Zhabei Elementary School, a private school in this city, was dissatisfied with the principal of the school, Wang Bingzhi. He posted flyers on the front and back doors of Wang's residence and on the glass windows of the school, which read: "Wang Bingzhi has a base character, improper behavior, no qualifications, and is using public office for private gain by ambiguously publishing the school's accounts. It has recently been heard that he is privately soliciting donations into his own pocket, which is hateful and should be dismissed." Wang, who was insulted, filed a lawsuit accusing Dai of damaging his reputation. After several investigations by the District Prosecutor's Office, Dai strongly denied it, claiming that the handwriting on the flyers was different from his own. However, witnesses Jiang Fengxiang and Zhang Ritong testified that Dai had indeed personally posted and distributed the flyers. Therefore, a public prosecution was initiated on the charge of damaging his reputation.

### Reporting a Theft While Checking Household Registrations; Two Robbers Arrested

[Report from this Newspaper] Wang Huagui from Jingjiang, 23 years old, used to be a member of the self-defense team of the Sanle Township Office in Jingjiang, carrying a German-made No. 2 box pistol. Recently, he and his fellow villager Yun Zhihe came to Shanghai with weapons and temporarily resided at the tailor shop of Yun's younger brother at No. 9 Daodeli, Jinling West Road. After lingering for several days, feeling extremely bored, they were guided by Yun to the home of Wang Cai, an acquaintance at No. 186 Huichang Lane, Huashan Road, to commit robbery on the afternoon of the 8th around 8:00 PM. After the victim cried for help, Police Officer No. 690 from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, who had just finished checking household registrations and was passing by, heard the sound and rushed to arrest the two thieves, seizing the murder weapons and escorting them to the branch office. They are currently being interrogated.

### Impersonating a Detective to Extort Money; Arrested on the Way Back After Obtaining Funds

[Report from this Newspaper] On the afternoon of the 8th of this month, Zhang Nengzhao, carrying a membership badge of the Shanghai Lizhi Society, led unemployed hooligans Ding Dianxiao and Chen Haiqi to the home of Gong Nianbao at No. 4 Dingkang Lane, Fanhhuangdu Road, impersonating a detective from the Putuo Road Branch Office. Under the pretext of investigating stolen goods, they extorted 300 million yuan. After Gong repeatedly requested a reduction, it was reduced to 100 million yuan. Then Zhang followed Gong out to borrow money from Qiao Jinbo at the Heping Hotel in Caojiadu Wujiaochang but failed. He then went to Wang Xiaolin on Singapore Road and borrowed five promissory notes totaling 60 million yuan. This matter was discovered by Xu Senfu, a patrol officer of the Criminal Division of the Putuo Road Police Branch. He immediately led officers Wang Xiaoqing and Hua Zhenting, along with Police Officer No. 3063, to wait at No. 4 Dingkang Lane. When Zhang Nengzhao and others returned after obtaining the five promissory notes, they were arrested together and taken to the bureau for interrogation. Zhang confessed that he was a worker at the Lizhi Society. Ding and Chen were pedicab drivers. Recently, because the pedicab owner increased the deposit by 100 million yuan, they could not raise the money. Therefore, they discussed with their colleague Wang Xiaoyuan, who lived at No. 402 Xinji Street, Fanhhuangdu Road, to engage in extortion. Subsequently, accomplice Wang Xiaoyuan was arrested and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning yesterday.

### First Batch of Muslim Pilgrimage Group Departs Today; Carrying Many Daily Necessities; Expected to Return by the End of the Year

[Report from this Newspaper] The Muslim Pilgrimage Group from Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, totaling 160 members, has arrived in Shanghai in batches, led by Group Leader Hua De'er, Deputy Group Leader Shen Linhan, and Ma Rongqing. The group's original itinerary was to travel by boat via Hong Kong and Singapore, and then transfer to a special ship directly to the holy city of Mecca. However, due to the limited number of berths between Shanghai and Hong Kong, the itinerary was temporarily changed to depart in several batches. The first batch of 48 people will depart for Hong Kong on the Shengjing Wheel this morning, and the rest will fly to Hong Kong for assembly on the next two days. Ding Lingting, the Secretary-General of the China Islamic Association, came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday to take care of the arrangements. According to him, Muslims in the Northwest have "five pillars" that must be fulfilled in their lives, namely "Shahada" (declaration of faith), "Salat" (prayer), "Sawm" (fasting), "Zakat" (charity), and "Hajj" (pilgrimage). Going on pilgrimage to the holy land is one of the five pillars, so Muslims attach great importance to it. Everyone considers it the greatest comfort to be able to go to Mecca once in their lifetime. Because the government respects the beliefs of Muslims, it has stipulated that Muslims be sent to the holy land for pilgrimage once a year since last year. Although the country is currently experiencing economic difficulties, it has still approved an allocation of £7,200 in foreign exchange for the group's travel expenses. The group needs to stay in Mecca until the end of the year before returning to the country. It is estimated that each member will need about £300 in foreign exchange. The government's current foreign exchange quota is only £35 per person, and the shortfall will be supplemented by each member applying for self-provided foreign exchange. The group stated yesterday that the government handles their passports and foreign exchange matters every year with great speed, so that the Muslim pilgrimage can be successfully achieved. All Muslims in the Northwest are extremely grateful. Because the group will be staying abroad for a long time this time, in addition to a complete set of cooking utensils, each person is carrying medicines, "Junbai" (the pilgrimage robes), "Hastal" (the white cloth used to wrap the head), ablution kettles, seasonings, and other items.

### Coveting Small Gains and Trampling the Law; Housewife Learned From Apprentice; Prosecuted

[Report from this Newspaper] The District Prosecutor's Office recently prosecuted Zhang Chen Yueying, a housewife of Dasing Skin Company in this city, and Zhang Longsheng, an apprentice, on charges of fraud. Before the company remitted funds to the Tianjin Xushu Commercial Bank at No. 63 Tianchu Road, the housewife and apprentice secretly extracted several banknotes from each bundle of banknotes. As a result, when a local Ye Qihua went to the bank to withdraw money, he discovered that 15.3 million yuan was missing from the 50 million yuan banknotes bearing the company's seal. He reported to the police station, and after investigating the process, the two were arrested. According to their confession, they had stolen a total of five times.

### Case of Raising Air Freight Prices; Trial Concluded; Sentencing on the 16th; Five Witnesses Arrived from Peiping and Xi'an to Testify

[Report from this Newspaper] The case of senior officials of China and Central Aviation Companies being accused of taking advantage of the transportation difficulties between Peiping and Shanghai to raise freight prices continued to be heard in the Third Criminal Court of the District Court at 3:30 PM yesterday. In addition to the defendants Liu Anping, Jiang Nengxiang, Xu Xin from China Aviation Company and Deng Gaozhang from Central Aviation Company, the court also summoned five defense witnesses, Lin Dakang, Shi Dafu, Wu Liexing, Wang Dingnan, and Ding Yeye, from Peiping, Xi'an, and other places to testify. Lin and Shi were employees of the Peiping office of Central Aviation Company. They stated: "In July of last year, they worked in the airport or receiving department in turns. They only knew Dabe Company, but did not know Qi Nianzhu. They also stated: "There was more than one company transporting goods between Peiping and Shanghai, and there was no refusal to transport goods from Dabe or other companies. There are company shipping records to prove it." The defense lawyer for the defendant stated: "In addition to Dabe Company, they also transported goods for the Joint Logistics Headquarters, the Northwest Industrial Company, and the Hwa Mao Company." Regarding the accusation of refusing to transport goods by Peiping merchants, Lin and Shi Chen stated: "The company receives goods entirely based on the application form filled out by the merchants, which is approved by Director Yan Duzhou." Next, Lang Liexing, who worked at the Peiping office of Central Aviation Company last year and was later transferred to Xi'an, testified. His testimony was generally the same as that of Lin and Shi, but he stated that he only submitted aircraft take-off and landing reports and never went to the office, so he did not know whether Central Aviation Company refused to transport goods from other companies. Next, the court inquired about the details of the investigation by the Military Affairs Bureau and questioned Wang Dingnan, the current director of the Peiping office of Central Aviation Company. He stated: "In October of last year, the former director of the Peiping office, Yan Duzhou, requested a transfer, which was approved by the head office. I was ordered to transfer from Jinan to Peiping to take over the position, then transferred to Nanchang. However, after Yan came to Shanghai from Peiping, he resigned. Yan's wife said that her husband left Peiping at the end of April this year, but she could not guarantee whether it was true. On November 23 of last year, the Military Affairs Bureau sent personnel to investigate. Because I took over on October 14, I did not know anything about the situation of air transport between Peiping and Shanghai from July to September last year. There was no way to answer, so I arranged for Shi Dafu, Wu Liexing, and two other relevant personnel to discuss it the next day. The results were unknown." Finally, the witness Ding Yefu, the secretary of the Jinshan Company, stated that the fugitive defendant Zhou Peiran was not an employee of the Jinshan Company. He did not know whether he was using the name to contact air transport. The Jinshan Company did not have a branch in Peiping and had no relationship with China Aviation Company. At this point, the court further interrogated the four defendants, and their statements were the same as before. The prosecutors present then rose to state the intentions of the prosecution. The defendant's lawyers then began to debate, and Deng Gaojun also submitted additional evidence. At around 6:00 PM, the debate ended, and the sentencing was scheduled for the 16th of this month.

### Travel Notes Outside the Pass (V): Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall

— Our Newspaper Reporter Song Lin

[Report from this Newspaper, Lanzhou, 2nd (by airmail)] The sun doesn't set in Dunhuang until after 9:00 PM. After dinner, we still have plenty of time to stroll through the streets. Dunhuang doesn't have many main streets, but there are dozens of alleys, all named after various prefectures and counties in Gansu. It is said that after the city was completed in the sixth year of the Yongzheng reign of the late Qing Dynasty, people from various prefectures and counties in Gansu were moved here and lived in separate districts, so the alley names were directly based on place names.

Among the three counties and one bureau outside the pass, Dunhuang has the largest area, with over 140,000 square kilometers, and at least 150,000 mu of fertile land suitable for farming. Canals crisscross the area, and there are few disputes over water conservancy. We went out of the city to the Dang River to watch the sunset. In the sandy land, we saw towering willows, continuous stretches of flat fields, turbulent rivers, and dense orchards, as if we were in Jiangnan. The melons and fruits of Dunhuang used to be tribute items and have a long-standing reputation. Unfortunately, they are not yet ripe when we arrived. There is only one type of pear-sized apricot, which has a different taste than Lanzhou apricots. Cotton is not produced in various places in Hexi, but Dunhuang alone produces over 700,000 catties of cotton per year. The people spin yarn and weave homemade cloth, which can be used to clothe themselves. This year's rainfall is suitable, and over 100,000 shi of wheat can be harvested.

Dunhuang's Population Gradually Decreasing

The population of Dunhuang is also decreasing day by day. In the past, during the Han and Tang dynasties, there were 130,000 people in one prefecture and six counties, but now there is only a fraction of that. There are also more than 600 Mongols living around Nanhu, organized under the direct jurisdiction of the county. These descendants of the Han, who fled here, have lost the ability to hunt on horseback and have become tenant farmers for the locals.

Heavily Made-up Young Women

Dunhuang has a special custom, which is that during temple fairs, all unmarried women are heavily made up and come from all over the countryside to the fair to be judged, without feeling ashamed. Young men roam around in the crowd, looking for a partner, and then inquire about their family background and ask someone to be a matchmaker. Religion is particularly prosperous here. In the Guandi Temple, which was rebuilt in the 30th year of the Republic, we saw a large iron knife weighing about 180 catties, which two people had difficulty lifting. Next to the temple, there are also several sections of the "Great Tang Governor Yang Gong Ji De Stele" and the "Great Tang Hexi Road Guiyi Army Jiedushi Suo Gong Ji De Stele." According to the county chronicles, the "Little Penglai Mountain" lantern shed in front of the drum tower used to be as grand as the Lantern Festival in the Western Capital, but the people of today rarely have this kind of interest.

Ancient Yumenguan and Yangguan

Several dozen li west of the city is the ancient Yumenguan, which is the place where the Han people said, "I only wish to be born into Yumenguan." Several dozen li southwest is Yangguan, which is the place in the Tang poem "West of Yangguan, there are no old friends." Beyond the two passes, only the ancient battlefield elegies "Vast, the flat sands are boundless, labor is not seen… Dark, bleak, the wind is sad and the sun is setting" can describe it.

Red Willow Used as Fuel

The most serious problem in Dunhuang is the lack of fuel. There is no coal production nearby, and the people burn red willow and various weeds from the grass lake. Currently, the places for cutting firewood are getting farther and farther away, and there are disputes over firewood with neighboring areas. If the wild firewood is exhausted in the future and the coal resources have not been developed, it is feared that the nearby forests will be reduced to ashes.

Current and Past Dynamics of the Kazakhs

The people of Dunhuang and Anxi are most threatened by the harassment of the Kazakhs living in the southern mountains. The Kazakh people mostly live in the Ashan area in the northern part of the Tianshan Mountains. After the "April 12th" coup in Xinjiang in 1933, they gradually moved eastward and merged with the Kazakhs in Zhenxi. The Kazakh people are naturally mobile and extremely unwilling to be restricted, let alone change their way of life. After Sheng Shicai came to power, he adopted terror tactics and suppressed them in every possible way. The Kazakhs were afraid of being communized, so they regarded Gansu as a happy land and came to join them one after another. In 1936 and 1937, they entered the Qilian Mountains and drove out the original Mongols. In a few years, they all had cattle, sheep, horses, and camels and became increasingly wealthy. In February of last year, the government funded the repatriation of most of them to Xinjiang. Now only 2,400 people live in the mountains south of Andun and graze their livestock, occasionally coming out of the mountains to plunder livestock. According to the Dunhuang county magistrate, a small number of people are also planting opium. When we were in Dunhuang, the county government sent people to Hongliugou to investigate and eradicate opium seedlings. We heard that the area planted was very large, but no one was guarding it.

The Kazakhs in the southern mountains are now led by six leaders, including Husayn and Agonbayi. In recent years, the military and political authorities have repeatedly allowed funding for repatriation to Xinjiang, but they are always unwilling to leave quickly. This year, they promised to start departing one after another from August 1, and everyone hopes that this time will not be disappointing.

### Strange Sight in Ningbo: Three to Four Thousand Swallows and Sparrows Flying Through Crowds

After an hour, they howled and fled, with a total loss of no less than 10 billion in cash and jewelry.

### Numerous Nantong Bank Drafts; The Pacification Headquarters Requests the Ministry of Finance to Crack Down

The Level of the Wealth Levy has been Decided

[Our Nantong Dispatch, 8th] Due to the shortage of cash in Nantong, the Administrative Commissioner's Office of the First Pacification Area has reported to the Ministry of Finance requesting a swift crackdown on the practice of issuing bank drafts by national, provincial, and county banks, as well as private banks.

[Another Dispatch] The Nanjing Relief Special Levy has allocated 20 billion to this county for fundraising, and the provincial government has telegraphed the Speaker of the County Council, urging him to quickly promote fundraising.

[Another Dispatch] Regarding the wealth levy being imposed in this county, which was reported in this newspaper on the 6th, the levels of collection have now been revised to be calculated based on rice prices. For commercial banks and private banks, factories, and companies, they will be divided into five levels: those with 1,000 stones or more, 500 stones or more, 100 stones or more, 50 stones or more, and 10 stones or more, and they will be levied monthly.

### Former and Current Mayors of Nanchang Embezzle Large Sums; Exposed

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 10th] Tang Xin, the former mayor of Nanchang, embezzled 200 million in suppression and construction funds, and the current mayor, Xiong Jun, also embezzled 4 billion. In addition, the municipal government's cooperative also embezzled 300 million. After being reported, the suppression and construction committee decided to recover the full amount. From January to June of this year, a total of 19 billion in suppression and construction donations were collected and deposited in municipal banks, without any interest accrued so far.

### The Dreadful Sleeping Sickness; Prevention Methods Worth Noting

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 10th] The dreadful sleeping sickness has struck students at the Chengdu Military Academy, and some have already died from it. This reporter interviewed Bai Xin, the military academy's doctor, who explained the causes, symptoms, treatment, and prevention methods as follows:

(1) Types: This disease has two types: (A) and (B). Type (A) is scattered in Europe and the United States and is rarely epidemic. Type (B) is further divided into Saint Louis (B) type and Japanese (B) type. The former is prevalent near Saint Louis City in the United States, while the latter is prevalent in Japan, China, and India. The pathogens, pathological anatomy, and epidemic situations are generally the same, but the mortality rate of the former is 20%, while the latter is higher, about 60% to 70%. The mortality rate is even higher for the elderly and children. The current outbreak at the military academy belongs to the latter, namely Japanese (B) type epidemic encephalitis.

(2) Pathogen and Transmission: This disease was discovered in Saint Louis City in the United States in 1933. The pathogen is a filterable virus, with a size of about 20 to 30 millimicrons. It multiplies in living cells and cannot survive in culture media. The vector of transmission is mosquitoes, and intermediate hosts include horses, sheep, and rabbits. However, people under 45 years of age are more likely to be affected. Transmission occurs more frequently in the summer, and there are more cases outside urban areas than in cities. The incubation period is 4 to 21 days.

(3) Symptoms: According to the severity of clinical symptoms, it can be divided into three categories: (1) The first category is the most serious of the three, with no prodromal symptoms. It suddenly develops high fever, nausea, vomiting, headache, drowsiness, stiffness of the forehead, and other symptoms. Clinical examination shows Kernig's sign positive, motor ataxia, disappearance of abdominal wall superficial reflexes, enhancement of deep reflexes, paralysis of eye muscles, increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, increased globulin and glucose, and increased number of cells. (2) The second category mainly involves symptoms such as headache, fever, abdominal pain, and discomfort. Occasionally, there are also cases of sore throat and conjunctivitis. (3) The third category has extremely mild symptoms, with only headache and mild fever, and no changes in cerebrospinal fluid.

(4) Diagnosis: Diagnosis can be made based on clinical symptoms and examination of cerebrospinal fluid, such as increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, increased globulin and cell count, etc. The most accurate diagnostic methods are neutralization and complement fixation tests.

(5) Treatment and Prognosis: There is no specific treatment. The main treatment is symptomatic. Patients should be moved to a well-ventilated room and avoid stimulation such as sound and light. Pay attention to nutrition. If necessary, nourishing enemas and nasogastric feeding can be administered. Inject 50% glucose solution and physiological saline into the patient. Do not give sedatives. To relieve meningeal irritation symptoms and reduce cerebrospinal fluid pressure, cerebrospinal fluid can be drawn. In addition, attention should be paid to the occurrence of complications.

(6) Prevention: The most effective method is preventive inoculation, but unfortunately, this country does not have this vaccine and cannot implement it. The general preventive measures are to isolate patients, vigorously implement mosquito control, and use DDT to eradicate mosquitoes in the affected areas. In addition, attention should be paid to daily hygiene in clothing, food, housing, and transportation to enhance the body's resistance. In conclusion, the mortality rate of this disease is very high, and there is no special treatment method. Therefore, attention should be paid to the prevention of this disease.

### Fighting the Furious Tide in Haining; A Visit to the Jianshan Seawall Project

— Our Correspondent, Yang Shusheng

[Our Haining Dispatch, 8th] The "Haining Tide" is famous both domestically and internationally. Before the War of Resistance, every year on the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month, this ancient county town was always packed with people, and the bustling scene was unmatched by any festival. However, during the War of Resistance, the Qianjiang River bank was ravaged by the enemy and puppet troops, and the seawall was in disrepair for many years, which planted the seeds of a major disaster. After the victory, there were numerous breaches in the Qianjiang River, creating dangerous situations. In order to actively repair the seawall, the authorities organized the "Qiantang River North Bank Emergency Repair Committee" and an engineering office in January of the 35th year of the Republic. In August, it was reorganized into the "Zhejiang Province Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau," with separate engineering offices in Hanghai, Yanping, and Shaoxiao, and actively launched repair work.

Endless Repairs

The Hai'ning County section of the Qianjiang River's north bank seawall is the most dangerous. After more than two years of efforts by the Seawall Engineering Bureau, the following have been completed: (1) Jianshan light railway and quarry, (2) Jue-character stone seawall, (3) Xincang wave barrier, (4) Chenwengang firewood seawall project, (5) Qilimao Tang, Tang, Zhong, and Li character firewood seawall projects, (6) Babao stone seawall project. The wave barrier projects in Mugang, Qilimao, and Chenwengang are currently under repair. The recently completed Jue-character stone seawall and Xincang wave barrier have been damaged again due to the impact of the furious tide. This kind of continuous repair work progresses endlessly, and it holds the safety and happiness of millions of people along the seawall.

Six Rows of Foundation Stones Swept Away

At 7:00 AM on the 7th of this month, we departed from Xiashi and arrived at Yuanhua. Then, hosted by the Seawall Engineering Office, we took a special vehicle to Jianshan. Along the way, we saw that this was the area most severely affected by rice stem borers. Farmers were catching stem borers under the scorching sun, without any signs of fatigue. This kind of enduring and arduous spirit made people feel infinitely moved. When we arrived at Chenjiaogang, the furious tide was surging, and the seawall was rolling away. When we returned to Qilimao, six rows of foundation stones of the wave barrier in the 11th Fort area had been swept away. This kind of shocking news was really enough to make people tremble.

The Jianshan quarrying project is currently proceeding smoothly. On average, it produces 200 tons of stone per day. The stones must use a compressor to control the power of the quarrying machine. Through the power of a large crane, the huge stones are transported to small trains and transported to various construction sites. There are also several tugboats that specialize in transporting crushed stones to Xiaoshao and other places for use.

Construction of Wave Barriers

The focus of the Seawall Engineering Bureau's projects in Haining is now on the construction of wave barriers. The greatest benefit of wave barriers is to prevent collapse, prevent the outflow of sea sand, and make the seawall strong and undamaged. Its main materials are tree trunks and stones. Ocean pine wood with a diameter of about one foot and a length of more than 50 meters is driven into the seabed more than 20 meters using a pile driver, and then thick boards are used to connect and clamp it, and huge stones are placed in the gaps. This kind of project is often destroyed halfway during high tides. However, due to funding constraints, this project is the most important before the ability to build stone seawalls, and the Seawall Engineering Bureau has deep confidence in this.

Workers Work Day and Night

The Seawall Engineering Office's funding is now allocated by the Sino-American Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, limited to 20 billion yuan per month. Therefore, many projects cannot be launched due to funding constraints. They mobilize more than 300 workers every day to work in two shifts, day and night, fighting against the huge waves. This spirit is worth singing.

The sand outside the Haining seawall has completely collapsed, and the furious tide has rushed ashore several times. The "Tide Watching Festival" is coming soon, and it is expected that the 18th day of the eighth lunar month this year will be unprecedentedly lively and crowded. In order to prevent the Haining Tide from being submerged, and at the same time ensure the safety of millions of people along the seawall, this repair project should attract the attention of the public.

Due to time constraints, both the commercial bank and the person receiving the money rely only on a sealed signature and do not have the opportunity to count the bills in detail, thus giving the merchants the opportunity to engage in illegal activities. In the sealed banknotes, they remove varying amounts, such as 10,000 or 20,000 yuan per million. The citizens have suffered greatly. In order to rectify the merchants' ethics, the county government has specially dispatched cadres to investigate secretly. Once discovered, they will be severely punished.

### Zhang Bingli Seeking Son Guoliang

I am a poor and ignorant villager with two sons. My eldest son died early, and my younger son's name is Zhang Guoliang. He joined the army in May of the 34th year of the Republic. After the victory, he was stationed in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, and was reorganized into the 6th Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Regiment, 3rd Reserve Brigade, 57th Division of the Army, as a private first class. I received several letters from him. However, it has been more than two years since I last heard from him, and there is no news. I don't know where he is now, or if he has died for the country. My wife became ill due to missing her son so much and died in July of last year. I am pitifully drifting alone in Shanghai, tasting all the pain of life, barely surviving, and it is difficult for me to live long. I want to meet my son before I die so that I can die in peace. Knowing that your newspaper is enthusiastic about serving the society, I dare to request that this letter be published. If I can get information from his classmates, colleagues, or relatives, even if I cannot repay the kindness in life, I will repay it in death! I wish you peace. Respectfully, Zhang Bingli from Xiangshan, Zhejiang. Contact address: Yongxiang Shop, No. 402, 3rd Section, Zhejiang Middle Road, Shanghai.

### 250,000 Denomination Customs Gold Units to be Widely Issued Starting Next Week; National Bank Authorities Deny Issuing New Currency

[Our Dispatch] Rumors that "Sun Yat-sen Currency" will be issued on the day the new economic plan is announced, and that the ratio of the new currency to legal tender will be one to four million, and the ratio to the US dollar will be two to one. The reporter specifically asked Chen Yanzuo, Deputy Director of the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank, who said: "There is no such thing. Only Customs Gold Units with a face value of 250,000 will be issued starting next week." He also believes that the timing and conditions for reforming the currency system are not yet ripe. The rumor that the Central Printing Plant is rushing to print new currency is absolutely untrue. He does not know what kind of new currency there is other than legal tender and Customs Gold Units. As for the shortage of banknotes, the responsible party believes that it will gradually improve within a few days. Large banknotes of 5 million yuan have been prepared and will be widely issued throughout the country starting next week, and the printing efficiency has also improved recently. It is reported that the panic over cash on the market has reached its peak, because the price increase is too fast, and the existing denominations of legal tender are not enough to pay. After the 250,000 Customs Gold Units are issued, it can be temporarily eased. However, according to the observation of qualified people, based on the current rate of inflation, in three months, the existing large banknotes may not be able to meet the needs of the market.

### Off-Market Stimulation Strengthens; A Wave of Gains Sweeps Through Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, the rise of Chinese stocks was driven by large investors going long and a cyclical rise in the stock market. The gains gradually expanded in twists and turns. The morning session had already opened the prelude, and the afternoon session intensified the gains. Yong Yarn closed at the limit with a new high of 15,510 yuan, and Meiya also had to open at a premium. More than ten other stocks also closed at the limit.

Initially, due to the dull news about economic reforms, people's minds were slightly stable. Except for the small stock Jingfu, which was affected by the strike and opened at a low level, Yong Yarn debuted at 14,180 yuan. The major investors of Nos. 89, 69, 169, 131, 23, 116, 152, 160, 143, 212, 95, 197, 14, and 117 all entered, rising to 14,800 yuan. At this time, there were many small twists and turns. New purchases of Meiya were eager and the most profitable. Yarn and cloth prices all rose sharply. Nos. 224, 104, 148, 155, 137, 65, and 16 advanced to 15,300 yuan. Rongfeng, Meiya, and other stocks rose to the limit. Nos. 224, 169, 172, 228, 117, 218, and 207 sold off, falling back to 15,050 yuan. The Hong Kong telegram was 6 points, and Nos. 4, 151, 76, 55, and 169 advanced to a new high of 15,350 yuan. Nos. 199, 143, and 224 slightly sold off, closing in the morning at 15,260 yuan. Except for Huochai, Xinyi, Tongyi, Huaxin, Zhongni, and Zhongxing, which closed at the limit, Shangni rose slightly. Meiya, Zhongshen, Xinhe, Neiyi, Rongfeng, and Meilin rose to the limit and then recovered, rising half to one percent along with the other stocks.

The off-market stimulation was even stronger in the afternoon session. Yong Yarn opened at a new high of 15,510 yuan and closed at the limit. Meiya, Xinhe, and 13 other stocks also reached the limit. Yong Yarn's high price had to be increased by 250 yuan. Nos. 207, 99, 134, 148, and 89 sold off at high prices, falling in twists and turns. Meiya retreated from an increase of 10 yuan to within the limit. Yong Yarn also slightly fell back to 15,450 yuan. It is generally speculated that the National Bank's deficit will reach more than 3 trillion. However, people's minds have changed, and buyers have the upper hand. After Nos. 65, 89, and 173 and others re-entered, they had to be increased by more than 200 yuan before closing, finally hovering between 100 and 150 yuan. Meiya was 5 to 10 yuan. Compared with the morning session, Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinhe, Meilin, Tongyi, Datong, Huochai, Zhongni, Liandi, Zhabei, Zhongxing, Huaxin, Shangni, Xinyi, and Hengfeng closed at the limit. Rongfeng, Huafeng, Jinglun, Xinguang, Zhongshen, Wuhe, Zhongfa, and Xinhua rose slightly. Guohuo, Yuean, and Neiyi were stable. Qin Xing and Shangwu slightly fell back. Off-market, unlisted stocks such as Wenhua, Gongyong, Nanyang, Wuzhou, Huacheng, and Zhongxing were still outstanding, while the rest were mediocre.

Government Bonds

Government bonds were also driven up by the stock market yesterday. However, they were slightly fatigued due to initial disappointment. Tongbing opened in the morning at 1.6 million, with a low price of 1.59 million, rising to 1.81 million, and then slightly decreased. Rooms 550 and 552 sold, while Rooms 500, 503, and 360 all entered. About 4 million were traded. Compared with the previous session, A, B, and E each rose by 80,000 yuan, C rose by 120,000 yuan, and D also rose by 70,000 yuan.

### National Salvation Bonds and Others Drawn for Repayment of Principal Yesterday

The eighth repayment of principal for National Salvation Bonds, the nineteenth repayment of principal for the 27th Year of the Republic Gold Bonds, Customs Gold Bonds, US Dollar Bonds, and British Gold Bonds, the thirteenth repayment of principal for the first tranche of the 29th Year of the Republic Military Supplies Bonds, the twelfth repayment of principal for the second tranche, the thirteenth repayment of principal for the first tranche of the 29th Year of the Republic Construction Gold Bonds, the twelfth repayment of principal for the second tranche, the eleventh repayment of principal for the first tranche of the 30th Year of the Republic Construction Bonds, and the tenth repayment of principal for the 31st Year of the Republic Allied Victory US Dollar Bonds were publicly drawn by the Public Debt Division of the Ministry of Finance on the fourth floor of the Renji Road Communications Bureau in this city at 9:00 AM yesterday. A total of 264 winning tickets were drawn this time, with a total repayment amount of 19.8 million yuan in legal tender, 4.4 million yuan in Customs Gold Units, 7.7 million yuan in US dollars, and 540,000 yuan in US dollars.

### Easy Credit and Shortage of Cash; Banks Reverse Course and Advance Yesterday

Yesterday, the city's credit situation remained easy, and the market was still extremely short of cash. The four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury had a net advance of 226.1 billion yuan in the exchange of bank and money industry bills, reversing the large deficit of recent days. Among them, the Central Bank had a net advance of 60.8 billion, the Bank of China had a net advance of 261.71 billion, the Bank of Communications had a net advance of 146 billion, the Farmers Bank had a net deficit of 476.8 billion, the China Trust Bureau had a net deficit of 301.3 billion, the Postal Remittance Bureau had a net advance of 115.6 billion, and the Cooperative Treasury had a net advance of 109.5 billion. Commercial banks had a large exchange deficit of 254.17 billion and a small exchange deficit of 196.71 billion. Foreign banks had a total net advance of 261.71 billion.

### National Bank's Materials and Finance Committee Discusses Tobacco Purchase and Sale Methods

The fifth meeting of the Central Bank's Materials and Finance Committee resolved several cases related to the purchase and allocation of materials, the most important of which were the purchase of coal from the Kailuan Coal Mine and the discussion and determination of methods for purchasing and allocating tobacco from the place of origin, at the request of the city's tobacco factories. In addition, technical issues such as the scope of goods to be purchased, the methods for ordering loans, and sales methods were also discussed in detail.

### The Gold Control Bureau Decides Not to Lift the Ban on Using Bills for Collateral

The Shanghai Silver, Money, and Trust Industries Association jointly submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, echoing the request of the city's Chamber of Commerce to the Ministry of Finance, believing that the restriction on the use of bills as collateral had failed and requesting a return to the original state of collateral use, expressing their approval and urging the Ministry of Finance to lift the ban to facilitate financial circulation. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai Gold Control Bureau, the issue of using bills as collateral is a government policy that cannot be changed temporarily. Recently, due to the shortage of cash in the market, bank drafts have been rampant, and large banknotes have been discounted. Various parties attribute the various difficulties to the restriction on the use of bills as collateral, and they will improve after the shortage of cash improves. Therefore, there is no need to worry. In other words, the use of bills as collateral has a significant effect on suppressing credit expansion. The government will not abandon this important strategy.

### The Preparatory Committee of the Industrial Association Discusses How to Use Self-Provided Foreign Exchange

The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Industrial Association convened a group meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss how to utilize overseas Chinese capital and self-provided foreign exchange. More than ten people attended, including Tian Heqing, Hong Nianzu, Hu Xiguan, and Guo Yongxi. The following resolutions were made: (1) Utilize overseas Chinese capital and deposits of Chinese citizens abroad and relax the import quotas for raw materials, raw salt, and equipment, but requests for exemptions for domestically produced finished products should not be made. (2) Factories are allowed to settle foreign exchange for reinvestment funds to purchase raw materials and production equipment from abroad. As for the previous concern of the Export and Import Control Committee that the influx of funds after opening overseas Chinese capital and self-provided foreign exchange might flow to the black market, this point is no longer a concern. The Industrial Association also decided to hold a joint meeting with the Import and Export Trade Association and the Industrial Association within a few days to conduct further research and formulate methods for the Export and Import Control Committee to use as reference.

### Yarn Market Firm and Brisk Buying; Cotton Cloth Reaches New High Price; Leader's Market Once Hailed 80 Million Outside the Ring

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market situation, due to favorable environmental news, was heavily traded by Tianjin, Guangdong and other groups. The street itself had a loose and abundant money supply, and buying activity unfolded in the market, leading to a prosperous atmosphere.

Forty-two count Blue Phoenix fine yarn, upon opening, immediately jumped to 290 million yuan. Subsequently, due to the improved exchange certificate market and a recovery in exports, and hearing that the Leader's fine cloth was rising, groups from Sichuan and Hankou rushed to buy, pushing the market again to 2.95 billion, expected to close at 3 billion tomorrow, a further increase of 390 million to 420 million yuan compared to the previous day.

Other coarser and finer counts of yarn, due to absorption by both local and external customers, saw a general rise of around 15% to 20%, with 103 transactions completed.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market, due to rumors that the new economic reform plan would be postponed, led to increased speculation. Furthermore, with continuous dispatches from banks and bureaus, and related materials soaring in price, yarn prices reached new peaks, causing those in the industry, who had been quiet for a long time, to become active, and buying interest in the market suddenly increased.

Twelve-pound Leader's fine cloth, upon opening in the morning, was first aggressively purchased by the northern groups, with local cloth merchants and groups from Xuzhou, Zhaopu, and other places competing to absorb it, causing the market to immediately soar by 2.1 million yuan. Subsequently, with active external capital, the Hankou group also made purchases, with prices rising all the way to a closing price of 74.8 million, a rebound of 5.4 million yuan from the previous day (ultimately, with frequent favorable buying news, the price was further pushed up to 76.5 million, still difficult to acquire. In the afternoon, the market outside the ring once created a rare peak of 80.05 million, but due to the stable pricing of the Textile Construction Company's allocation and ample supply, the result was a call of 77 million yuan.)

In addition, various grades of fine cloth such as Five Blessings, Trumpet, Sunlight, etc., as well as coarse and fine twills, were also up by 3.5 million to 5.6 million yuan, while other colored cloths and Shilin cloths also saw firmer footing, with 2,040 bolts transacted.

Textile Construction Company Yarn Sale

Yesterday, the China Textile Company, on behalf of the Central Bank, sold four types of cotton yarn, totaling 876 pieces, authorized for purchase by 188 entities, valued at 165,731,000 yuan. Furthermore, the China Textile Company sold nine types of yarn yesterday, authorized for purchase by 470 entities, totaling 1,416 pieces, valued at 289,012,000 yuan.

US Cotton Price Drops

[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] Due to a US government report stating that this year's US cotton production will be the best in eleven years, the price of US cotton has fallen by $2.50 per bale today, with a continued downward trend. Note that China is a good customer of US cotton.

Yarn and Cloth Exports

The effort to strengthen exports of domestically produced yarn and cloth is becoming increasingly active. In addition to various manufacturers organizing export companies, another 2,500 tons of yarn and cloth will be shipped to Singapore, Hong Kong, Rangoon, and other places within days. This batch of export yarn and cloth is currently being declared to customs. Currently, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and other regions have a strong demand for domestically produced yarn and cloth, with many individual merchants privately carrying yarn and cloth to sell in those regions, generating substantial profits. This has prompted various yarn mills in the city to strengthen shipments there, it is said.

### Production Area Prices Reported High; Goods Owners Holding On; Rice Prices Rise Consistently; Oil Market Sentiment Active, Strong Rise

The rice market turned bullish again, with firm prices in the production areas. Goods owners were very reluctant to sell and unanimously insisted on raising prices, leading to a rise upon opening. While prices had previously stabilized due to poor sales, the closing price was ultimately driven up by the rise in prices of various external goods. White rice was at 45.5 million, thin-husked rice at 48.8 million, Jiashan's new Xian rice opened at 36 million, and special high-quality japonica rice at 48 million, all rising by 1.5 million to 2 million. The closing market was firm and brisk, with 6,020 piculs arriving yesterday.

Flour

Soared due to the rise in prices of various external goods. The announcement of the new economic plan was pending, leading to bullish sentiment. Moreover, with loose money supply, buying interest was constant. Old Che flour rose from 17 million to 17.6 million, and Bingchuan closed at 17.1 million, all rising by 1.3 million. Red Bee and Jiancheng were both priced the same as Bingchuan at 17.1 million yuan. Peacock and other miscellaneous flours all rose by 1.3 million to 1.4 million, bran rose by 1.1 million to 1.2 million, and the wheat market did not open.

Grains

All flourishing, because the prices of various goods outside the industry are rising, and customer groups are seizing the opportunity to take in a lot of goods, the sales are active, and the Huangdou oil group is taking in, up 3 million, and the corn has not risen much, and it has increased slightly by one million. Yuanmai Shantou and Qing were actively absorbing, and the price increased by another 3 million yuan. The silkworm beans and mung beans were not selling well to customers, only absorbed by the local street, and each slightly increased by 500,000 to 1 million. Mingguang Hongliang was 24.5 million yuan, and the sesame owners held on and rose by 3 million yuan. The raw kernels from Guangxi had entered and re-raised 7-8 million yuan.

Cooking Oil

Resumed a violent surge in prices, sentiment was active, and the prices of various goods outside the industry rose, and the factory first opened at a high price, and then the market prices were even higher. Soybean oil rose by 25 million yuan, and raw vegetable oil was 125 million yuan, also up by 25 million yuan, a rise of 20%. Jibao raw oil surged by 26 million yuan, and small cart sesame oil rose by 20 million yuan. Soybean cake followed suit, and the closing price rose by 1.12 million yuan.

### Limited Woolen Cloth Transactions

Due to seasonal and environmental factors, coupled with no change in the China Textile Company's pricing, the woolen fabric market has been calm recently, with little volatility. In terms of transactions, current fixed and small wholesale sales are limited. Regarding fixed orders, deliveries from Hong Kong are the only imported goods being discussed, with the local city having stopped discussing other imports long ago. Major domestic manufacturers want to accumulate their own stock and sell at favorable prices, not favoring fixed orders.

### Qingdao Textile Factories of China Textile Company Reduce Work in Rotation Every Week

### Closure of Fuel Management Committee; Coal Rationing Remains Unchanged

It is understood that after the committee's closure, the management of coal rations in the city will continue to adopt the current distribution methods.

### Tea Market Footing Solid

Since British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Concord, Jinlong, and Tongfu resumed their attention to this year's Qimen black tea, they are still interested, but ultimately, due to the thinness of existing stocks, coupled with the fact that the goods that the Anhui Tea Company and Zhenhe Tea Shop have been actively transporting to the production areas have not yet arrived here, the process continues to be characterized by supply not meeting demand. Transactions are as sparse as stars in the morning, and the latent power repeatedly obscures the edge, and the market is trending upwards. Its styles are also being exploited for price increases due to rampant money laundering, making the purchase atmosphere more robust. The main force is also taking the opportunity to raise the price, all rising across the board, and the footing is very solid.

### Hong Kong Trade Feels Impact After Implementation of Two New Restrictions

[United Press, Hong Kong, August 9th] According to the Far Eastern Economic Review here, Hong Kong may withdraw from the sterling area due to restrictions imposed by London on trade between its colonies and areas with convertible and semi-convertible currencies.

Two new restrictive orders have recently been implemented. The content is as follows:

(1) From August 3rd, all foreign exchange benefits obtained solely from the export of goods should be converted at the official rate and handed over to the Hong Kong government. However, exports to the United States, the Philippines, Macau, Korea, Japan, China, and the sterling area are not subject to this restriction.

(2) From July 26th, remittances of British pounds between London and Hong Kong are limited to 500 pounds.

According to the old law, all profits earned from exporting certain goods to hard currency countries should belong entirely to the Hong Kong government.

The Far Eastern Economic Review stated that the new regulations, along with the "temporary restrictions on import licenses" and the control of pound remittances, made it necessary to discuss "whether Hong Kong should continue to be included in the common interests or disadvantages of the pound area."

"There are benefits for Hong Kong, both current and future, after withdrawing from the sterling area. Most economic observers believe that Hong Kong is in fact just a large seaport and should not be included in the sterling area. Moreover, now that trade has gradually decreased, in order to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity, no restrictions should be added."

The article stated: "Hong Kong's banknotes have full pound reserves, and furthermore, Hong Kong has a considerable amount of deposits stored in London after the war, so "although Hong Kong's trade is still insufficient, Hong Kong's foreign exchange income and expenditure can still maintain a balance."

It continued: "The direct impact of the new regulations will be a reduction in Hong Kong's exports to hard currency and semi-convertible currency areas. In the past, this type of trade was profitable because the exchange rate of hard currency against the pound was higher.

Since foreign orders are all calculated in US dollars, importers in Hong Kong can still obtain all of their foreign exchange benefits, so although the Hong Kong dollar still has a considerable position, it is inevitable that the US dollar will become the main currency for Far East trade in the future."

"What makes the development of Hong Kong's trade feel dangerous is especially London's order to restrict import licenses. The policy obviously wants Hong Kong to reduce purchases from hard currency and semi-convertible currency areas, and increase purchases from the sterling area."

The Far Eastern Economic Review concludes on this matter as follows: "Whether Hong Kong can develop its trade under these circumstances is a big question."

### Our Basketball Team Steadily Secures Britain; Scheduled to Compete with Egypt in the Finals Tomorrow; The Entire Team Will Return Home by Plane on the 14th

[This newspaper report] London, 10th Broadcast: The Chinese World Games basketball team, in the third group playoff, is scheduled to rematch the British team tomorrow afternoon. Basketball has a short history in the UK, and the Chinese team can gain a certain victory. On the 12th, they will compete with Egypt, which defeated Italy, for the championship of the third group playoff, which is the 17th place.

[Central News Agency, London, 9th] This afternoon, the Chinese basketball team attending the World Games easily defeated Switzerland 42-34 in the playoff at Haringey Arena, where the final rankings of the participating countries were determined. Although the game proceeded slowly, the Chinese players clearly surpassed Switzerland in all aspects of basketball skills and strategy. Today's game was dull and tasteless, with the Chinese team lacking enthusiasm, only shooting when appropriate to maintain the lead. Both teams scored two points each in the first three minutes, after which China gradually increased its lead to 12-4. China's Jiaobao Song shot accurately, scoring a total of eleven points, leading the team's offensive. However, the Swiss players rallied and reduced the Chinese team's lead to only five points, with China leading 25-20 at the end of the first half. At the beginning of the second half, the Swiss team shot quickly, narrowing the difference in score. For only one minute, the Chinese team immediately fought hard, relying on Bao Songyuan and Li Shiqiao's wonderful moves under the basket, scoring three goals. After that, the Chinese team strengthened its defense and scored several goals to maintain its leading position in the first victory in this third-group elimination round. There will be no game tomorrow, and the Chinese team will play against the British team on the afternoon of the 11th. If China defeats Britain, it will play against Egypt on the 12th.

[Central News Agency, London, 9th] Jiang Lianggui, the leader and professor of our World Games basketball team, made a special broadcast to the country on the British Broadcasting Corporation tonight: "Since our arrival here ten days ago, we have played six games in the World Games basketball competition, with four wins and two losses.

### World Games Basketball Championship; The Last Four Teams are Produced; South Korea Loses to Mexico

[Central News Agency, World Games Venue, 9th, United Press] The fast-paced Mexican basketball team soundly defeated the seemingly tired Korean team tonight. Mexico won 42-32 and will face the winner of the match between the United States and Uruguay on the evening of the 11th. The tall Mexican team galloped swiftly, and the Korean team was unable to control the opponent's shots. Although the battle was brave and exciting, it was hopeless. When Mexico was leading 41-25, only a small half of the time was left. The Korean team's forward Li Caixun successively took two long-range shots, forcing it to 41-31. The Mexican team, known for its short, nimble, and well-trained Korean team, made every effort to deal with it and completely froze it in the remaining time, neither easily attacking nor allowing the ball to easily fall into the hands of the enemy team, aiming to waste time. Although the audience hissed and applauded, the Mexican team was determined to defend its position and win. The only scoring opportunity for the Korean team was in free throws.

[United Press, Haringey, 9th] The Mexican basketball team defeated the short Korean team 43-32 on the 9th. The Korean team gave its all despite the inevitable defeat, and its spirit is commendable. Before the end of the game, the Mexican team was leading 41-25. In just a few minutes, Korea actually chased to 32-43.

### India and Britain Decide on Hockey Champion

[This newspaper report] London, 10th Broadcast: The hockey competition has entered the final stage. Britain defeated Pakistan in the semi-finals and is scheduled to compete with India for the championship on Thursday evening at Wembley.

This is the eighth time that India and Britain have met in the finals. Since 1908, the battle between Britain and India for dominance has become a tradition. This time, Pakistan was full of hope and originally planned to break the previous eight-session convention and seize the right to compete with India in the finals, but fate did not favor people. Before the game, it rained heavily, and the field was slippery, which caused the Pakistani strongmen, who were accustomed to fighting on hard ground, to lose a lot of their color. Although they were able to barely maintain a tie in the first half, they were gradually controlled by the British athletes, who were in the same company as the low pressure, and scored two goals one after another, making the hope of a Sino-Indian duel a pie in the sky.

In this competition, India defeated Austria 8-0, defeated Argentina 9-1, overwhelmed Spain 2-0, and defeated the Netherlands 2-1 to enter the final. In total, they scored 24 goals and lost 2 goals.

Britain's defense is extremely strong, and it has been able to maintain a great record of not losing a single goal in four games. Britain won the first game against the United States by 11 goals, the second game against Afghanistan by 8 goals, the third game against Switzerland was a hard battle, with no records for each, and the fourth game defeated Pakistan by 2-0.

### Protest Against 400-Meter Relay is Established; US Team Rejudged Champion; Appeal Court Corrects Rankings

### International Basketball Cold War Ends; European Basketball Championship in Minnesota; Soviet Union Invites to Moscow; Basketball Association Meets to Discuss Germany's Participation in the Competition

[This newspaper report] London, 10th Broadcast: The Soviet Union's "Cold War" with the International Amateur Basketball Association has ended on Tuesday. The Basketball Association has received a suggestion from the Soviet Union that the next European Basketball Championship in 1949 be held in Moscow. Today, three uninvited guests, led by Soviet hero Beck Guanov-Riff, suddenly arrived and participated in the ongoing Basketball Association Congress, surprising everyone. The person in charge of the Basketball Association regarded this move as a symbol of the opening of the Soviet sports iron curtain, which was "extremely pleasant."

The current urgent task of the Basketball Association Congress is the reform of the rules. It is generally speculated that the General Assembly may vote to decide whether to simplify the ball rules along the lines of the United States' improvements over the past twelve years. For example, in the World Games competition, after each middle basket, the player must wait for the referee to touch the ball before continuing the game. The new rule will be changed to allow the player to immediately serve the ball from outside the boundary after the ball enters the basket to save time. The issue of player substitution will also be changed to unlimited.

Regarding fouls, in order to make the game more compact, it is planned to re-modify the regulations. "Non-unfair contact" will be allowed by the new rules. The so-called unfair impact refers to the act of deliberately touching the opponent's players with hands or kidneys. However, physical contact with the opponent's player when shooting back is not counted as a foul. In addition to the revision of the rules, the members' charter, legal issues, financial issues, competition system, and amateur qualification issues are all within the scope of the meeting.

It is also reported that the Basketball Association is now seeking to enable Germany to participate in international competitions. It is difficult to hope to be recognized before the whole issue of Germany is resolved, but most countries will not object to the German basketball team participating in the competition. The Basketball Association Congress will continue tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and is scheduled to end on Friday.

### World Games Athletes – Sex Verification

International Amateur Athletic Federation to Discuss

[Central News Agency, London, 10th] The International Amateur Athletic Federation, currently holding a conference here, discussed the issue of gender verification for athletes participating in future World Games.

According to Moscow Radio broadcasts, a female athlete threw the discus a distance of 185 feet and 2 inches, exceeding the world record for men's discus throw by about five feet.

### London's Poor Weather Does Not Diminish Audience Enthusiasm

[Central News Agency, London, 9th] Following four days of heavy rain, the most severe August storm in Britain in recent years has replaced the World Games and the Berlin crisis as the main topic of conversation. The storm caused considerable damage along the southeast coast yesterday. Although it has been raining continuously for three or four days after the start of the World Games, the British people and spectators from various countries who have traveled from afar are still braving the rain to attend. World Games athletes from various countries have made amazing performances under difficult conditions, setting twelve new records.

### Henan Refugee Students Petition the Ministry of Education, Requesting Improved Relief Treatment. The Issue of School Placement Cannot Be Resolved Immediately. Will Petition the Executive Yuan for a Fundamental and Proper Solution.

[Our Own Report, Nanjing, 10th] On the 9th and 10th, over a hundred students from the Central Plains Institute of Technology of Henan, Zhonghua College, and Commercial College petitioned the Ministry of Education, requesting to be assigned to various universities. Because permission had not been granted, they lingered and refused to leave. On the 10th, over a thousand students from Kaifeng Zhonghua Middle School, Zhengzhou Middle School, Su County Middle School, and Suining Middle School arrived at the ministry to request improved relief treatment and school placement. The Ministry of Education has already addressed the issue of improving relief treatment. However, due to practical difficulties, the issue of school placement could not be resolved immediately and the students finally left at 1 PM. At the time, some students prevented ministry staff from leaving, so the police department sent officers to persuade them, and they eventually dispersed. According to ministry officials, regarding higher education, the schools to which these petitioning students belong have not yet been formally registered, but the ministry is providing them with uniform shelter and relief. However, enrollment requires academic ability. Of the 16,000 candidates for China University, only one-tenth were admitted. Nine-tenths of the local students failed. Following this precedent, how can the Ministry of Education force universities to unconditionally accept refugee students? Regarding secondary education, they stated that the sources of middle school students are complex. Some graduated in 1945, while others have no documentation. In addition, order has been restored in many areas, and those who can return to their hometowns. Logically, the education departments of each province should be responsible for recalling the students from their respective provinces. This is a social problem that the Ministry of Education cannot handle alone. In addition to striving to provide relief within its responsibilities, the Ministry of Education plans to submit a proposal to the Executive Yuan and consult with relevant ministries to develop a fundamental and proper solution for the entire future of this matter.

### The Southward Migration of the Jiaozuo Institute of Technology

— Lei Zhen

Due to the impact of the current situation, the Jiaozuo Institute of Technology has relocated south to Wuxian to resume classes. With the active preparation of the school authorities, enrollment will begin soon. The school was originally located in Zhongzhou and was founded to meet the needs of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine. It was established by people with aspirations, and those outside the area may not be familiar with it. Here is a brief introduction to the school's history for the reference of those who are concerned about it.

Origins of the Founding: On March 1st, before the founding of the Republic of China, the British Fuzhong Company fulfilled its contract and established the Lu Mining School in Jiaozuo. In 1919, it established a specialized undergraduate program and was renamed Fuzhong Mining College. In 1923, to adapt to the school system, it was renamed Fuzhong Mining University. It was not until 1935 that it adopted its current name.

The original campus was in Jiaozuo, Henan. In October 1937, the Japanese invaders went south along the Pinghan Railway. When Anyang fell to the enemy, the situation became critical. The school moved west to Chang'an, and then to Tianshui. In the autumn of 1938, it was ordered to merge with the Engineering Colleges of National Northwest University and Northeast University to form the National Northwest Institute of Technology.

Process of Re-establishment: In October 1945, the school was approved to be re-established and resumed classes in Luoyang the following year. Unexpectedly, in August 1947, Hebei reported danger, and Luoyang was in imminent danger. To respond to the changing situation, the school moved to Zhengzhou and found a temporary campus, where it resumed classes in October of the same year.

The school has graduated a total of fifteen classes over the years, with a total of more than 300 students. Before the war, it established two departments: Mining and Metallurgy, and Civil Engineering. The graduates have served in various mines and have been able to uphold the school's original good traditions, be loyal to their duties, work hard, and achieve many successes, which have been praised by people from all walks of life.

Current Situation of the School: There are 25 faculty and staff members serving at the school. There is one class of Mining and Metallurgy students in the second year, one class of Metallurgy students, one class of Mining and Metallurgy students in the first year, and one class of Metallurgy students, with a total of more than 150 students.

Due to the many misfortunes in the Central Plains, and Zhengzhou being in a precarious state, the school had to relocate again. The president of the school, Zhang Qinglian, and professors Li Shantang and Zhang Jinghuai have all arrived in Wuxian to survey the campus so that classes can be resumed on time next semester. According to professors at the school, there are many universities and independent colleges in the southeastern provinces, including Taiwan, but none have the departments of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering. From this perspective, the southward migration of the school is in fact necessary for the local environment. It not only reduces the hardship of young people who aspire to study mining and metallurgy but also contributes to the training of talents needed during the period of national construction and to the detailed investigation of mineral deposits in the southeast, so as to lay the foundation for future development.

### On "The Fittest"

— Wu Yong

In the hour before the overthrow of the imperial system, some people thought that disobeying imperial orders was simply unthinkable; in the hour after the overthrow of the imperial system, obeying imperial orders immediately became equally unthinkable. These people were most opposed to the revolution; when the revolution succeeded, they were the most supportive of the revolution. Such people are what Darwin called "those who are good at adapting to the environment," now simply referred to as "the fittest."

When a "fittest" person sees injustice on the road, he will never express righteous indignation. Instead, he is very realistic. According to his observations, the weak always suffer. So, he resolves to do things that cause injustice; when a "fittest" person is beaten, he cannot be angry. He only envies the person who beat him and resolves to work hard to put himself in a position where he can legally beat others.

The "fittest" are the most knowledgeable of etiquette and law-abiding. Anyone who dares to disobey social etiquette and laws, who is not afraid of being shot by people, is either a heinous bandit or a superhuman sage, or else a combination of bandit and sage—a revolutionary. The so-called revolution is nothing more than using the means of a bandit to accomplish the mission of a sage.

Today, some people are doing things that are condemned by God and man, and their experiences are as if they have performed some great feat; some people are law-abiding and self-respecting, but their experiences are as if they have done many things that are condemned by God and man. The "fittest" are the most alert. In view of this, they are well aware of their own interests and know what to follow and what to avoid. He knows that being a bandit is too dangerous, being a sage is not worthwhile, and engaging in revolution is both unprofitable and dangerous. He chooses the most practical, stable, legal, and safe road to prosperity. He becomes another combination of bandit and sage—a national gentry. The so-called national gentry are those who use the means of a sage to accomplish the mission of a bandit, and the "fittest" are the most adept at using legal means to rob others of their property.

The "fittest" look down on those stubborn elements who refuse to adapt to the environment. When they see the latter, they feel amused, disgusted, and uncomfortable. They regard them as useless and stupid, and even think that they have committed a heinous crime. But if you treat him the way he treats others, then the "fittest" immediately becomes a sage.

The "fittest" are the most aware of the big picture. They firmly believe that eggplants have a fixed size, chickens and ducks can only walk on the ground, and peach blossoms must bloom in the spring. Once they see an eggplant that is larger than the average eggplant, they cannot help but see it as strange and must immediately pick it off and destroy it; when they see chickens and ducks soaring into the sky, they first mock them, then rebuke them. If the other party is still unrepentant, he shoots them. The hero Gandhi was shot down. The peach blossoms in winter, witnessing this situation, dare not bloom early. And the "fittest" are always the most timely. Anyway, the life he lives is always winter.

From the point of view of his "following the crowd," the "fittest" is a bit like a mediocre person, but in fact, the "fittest" is by no means a mediocre person. They are the so-called "sages of the times." H.L. Mencken called them "second-rate people," but these people are really the backbone of society. Only those who refuse to join the "Fittest Association" are mediocre people. Today's world is a world of second-rate people, and the second-rate talents of second-rate people are naturally most appreciated by the second-rate world. So, those outside this association are like turtles lying on their backs, inevitably killed by second-rate fools for food.

### What I Know About Wu Qingyuan (Part 2)

After Qingyuan arrived in Japan, he became a student of Seyama Kensaku. He was fifteen years old at the time. Seyama was extremely pleased with him and wanted to give him the rank of 4-dan. Honinbo, on the other hand, only intended to give him the rank of 2-dan. Later, Honinbo, Iwasawa, Suzuki, and Seyama, all 7-dan, and Katsu, Onoda, and Iwamoto, all 6-dan, jointly examined him, and only then was Qingyuan's 3-dan rank formally recognized. Here, I must briefly describe the origins of the Japanese go schools and the go institute. Japanese go has two schools: the Honinbo School and the Hoshukai School. The Honinbo School is the school of Honinbo Shuho. The Hoshukai School is led by Hirose Hirajiro and Seyama Kensaku. The so-called "dan" in Japan, such as the difference between 3-dan and 4-dan, is only half a komi in strength. The same is true between 7-dan and 8-dan. It has never been very strict. The strength of 3-dan and 4-dan may be completely equal. Since the reorganization of the Honinbo School and the Hoshukai School into the Go Institute, with Makino Nobuaki as the president and Okura Kihachiro as the vice-president, the go affairs and the examination of the qualifications of each dan in the institute were decided by Honinbo Shusai, Suzuki Yoshijiro, and Seyama Kensaku. It was only then that everything was strictly enforced, with no room for leniency. This time, Seyama's desire to give Qingyuan 4-dan was not a personal matter. Qingyuan's first game in Tokyo was against Fujiwara 4-dan. Fujiwara was one of the mainstays of the Japanese Go Institute, and Qingyuan actually won by resignation, which shows that he really had the strength of 4-dan. Although he was suppressed to 3-dan when he entered the Go Institute this time, Qingyuan was able to live up to his teacher's (Seyama) expectations. From 1928 to 1941, that is, from Qingyuan's fifteenth to twenty-seventh year, in just thirteen years, with two years in the middle suffering from anemia and not playing a single game, he was able to rise from 3-dan to 8-dan, which only a genius could achieve.

Lord Yi Yun said in his article "Also Talking About Wu Qingyuan": "It is extremely regrettable that Wu Qingyuan's genius was recruited by Japan." However, if Qingyuan had not gone to Japan, his go skills would have at most reached the level of 5-dan and he would not have become famous as the first master. Even if China had Fan Xiping now, Qingyuan could only study and practice with him, sticking to the old methods, and his achievements would not be able to fulfill his genius. This is because Chinese go and Japanese go have different paths. When we look at the go scores of Shi (Xiangxia) and Fan, almost every game has a close combat battlefield. Japanese go does not advocate melee combat. From beginning to end, they win in the virtual space. If Shi Fan were to come back to life, they would also study Japanese go and not specialize in the old methods. Among the Chinese national players of the past, only Huang Longshi had the style of Japanese go.

In 1923, I saw Qingyuan playing go with others in the Chunming Hall of the Central Park in Beiping. Qingyuan was only ten years old at the time, with two small braids on his head, and his moves were already amazing. Later, he played with the Japanese, but I did not have the opportunity to watch. However, I know many go friends. What I have recorded above is obtained from many sources, and I am confident that it is a true record.

### Coincidence

— Yun Gong

There are indeed many coincidences in the world, but if we analyze each coincidence, the proportion of true coincidences is probably still very low. The various coincidences arranged by film screenwriters and novelists to accommodate the twists and turns of the plot are of course criticized by those who have a little common sense. Even the real events that appear in news or special reports may have other reasons for their coincidences. Here are two examples to illustrate.

The first example is about a popular hairstyle for women. A female student at an American university once visited a coin exhibition hosted by Mr. Blanc, a collector of American coins, and discovered that the hairstyle of Queen Victoria engraved on a rupee minted by the British East India Company in 1840 was exactly the same as hers. She thought it was a great coincidence in the world and kept marveling at it. Little did she know that the president of the "American Hair Style Design Academy" had gone to Blanc's place to take coins engraved with women's images as a reference and as a blueprint for designing new styles. The hairstyle design of the university student was originally based on coin engravings, and it was not really a coincidence.

Another example involves the American drug dealer and murderer, Lanpuk Butchuerto. This person committed many evils, and the American police authorities pursued him very severely, but they have not yet been able to capture him. One day, Walter Winger, a famous American radio commentator, broadcast from the radio: "Lanpuk, can you hear the broadcast? No matter where you are, come forward!"

As a result, Lanpuk actually came forward. He surrendered to Walter Winger and FBI Director Ejia Hoover at a dark street corner in Manhattan, New York, causing a sensation across the United States. How could a cultural figure with no power and no courage be able to inspire a bandit to surrender and confess his guilt? According to people familiar with the matter, Lanpuk's surrender was due to the assurance of Kousterlau, the head of the underworld society, who is known as the number one mysterious figure in the United States. The authorities put pressure on Kousterlau, forcing him to hand over Lanpuk, otherwise it would be detrimental to him. As for Lanpuk surrendering after Winger's broadcast, it was just a deliberate deception. Later, Lanpuk was sentenced to death by electrocution. Before his execution, he cried loudly, cursing Kousterlau for betraying his friends.

Having read many similar records, the author cannot help but feel suspicious about many coincidences in the world, such as someone winning the first prize in a store's shopping lottery, or a certain master always maintaining the top position in a foreign competition. Perhaps due to age, I have a deeper understanding of the ways of the world.

### Giant Diamond

This is the pink giant diamond discovered by Canadian geologist Dr. Williamson in Africa in 1941, weighing 54 carats. When Princess Elizabeth of England got married, Williamson dedicated this diamond as a wedding gift. After three months of polishing, it has become the largest and most crystal-clear diamond in the world, weighing 23.6 carats net. In May of this year, this diamond was exhibited publicly in London for the first time. The picture shows the photo taken when the polishing was not yet completed, courtesy of the British News Office.

### Ramblings on the Double Seventh Festival

— Xiao Kangshi

Time flies, and it is the Double Seventh Festival again. Du Mu's poem "Autumn Evening" says: "Silver candle shines, the autumn light chills the painted screen, Light silk fan chases the fireflies. The heavenly steps, the night so cool, like water, Lying down, I watch the Herd Boy and the Weaving Girl star." It is well-known, and Li Shutong used it as a new song, making it even more immortal.

Bai Xiangshan's poem on the Double Seventh Festival says: "Smoke in the clouds, the moon is faint in the long sky, The autumn meeting of the Silver River is the same for all ages. How much joy and sorrow? Every year they are all in this night."

Meng Dongye has an ancient poem that says: "The Weaving Girl star is by the river, the Herd Boy is on the bank, Unable to cross the clear and shallow water, they look at each other from afar." It is indeed a satire.

Since the Double Seventh Festival is the auspicious time for the meeting of the two stars, the separated and the poets especially feel sad, as in Meng Haoran's poem "Double Seventh Festival in Another Land": "Meeting the Double Seventh Festival in another land, the inn adds to the sorrow of travel. I do not see the women threading needles, but only think of the ancestral home buildings. The beginning of the breeze lessens the heat, the new moon begins to descend on autumn. Who can bear to peep at the Milky Way? Far away, I gaze at the Dipper and the Ox." On the first day of the seventh month, there are those who sell "Qiao Guo" (skillful cakes) in the market, and they worship the two stars on the Double Seventh Festival to beg for skills. On the eve of the seventh day, they fill a cup with mandarin duck water, scoop up dew from the courtyard and mix it in, and dry it in the sun until the next day. When a film forms on the surface of the water, each person takes a small needle, throws it into the water to make it float, and then examines the shadow of the needle at the bottom of the water to test their intelligence.

The Jingchu Sui Shi Ji (Record of Customs of the Seasons in Jingchu) says: On the Double Seventh Festival, women string seven-holed needles with colored threads and display melons and fruits in the courtyard to beg for skills. If there is a magpie web on the melon, it is considered a good omen.

The Zhixu Ge Zazu (Miscellaneous Records from Zhixu Pavilion) says: On the Double Seventh Festival, Xu Jieyu carved lotus roots into strange flowers and rare birds, and arranged them on a crystal plate to present to the emperor. They were extremely exquisite, and the emperor praised them greatly, bestowing countless treasures. The emperor looked at them all day long, his joy indescribable. At dusk, the emperor scattered them himself on the tables in the palace, and ordered the palace women to take them secretly, with the one who took the most exquisite silk as the winner, calling it "fighting for skill" to bring laughter. On the eighth day of the seventh month, Xue Yaoying ordered all the maids to cut light silk together and make more than a thousand pairs of connected flowers, dyed them with sunstone, and scattered them in the courtyard at noon. They rose with the wind, covering the sky like five-colored clouds, and disappeared after a long time, calling it "crossing the river auspicious flowers" to beg for skills.

The women of Guangdong beg for skills every year on the evening of the sixth day, burning incense and candles. In addition to preparing melons and fruits, there is also a kind of "Double Seventh Basin" made of paper, which is not found in other places. The Guangdong native goods shops in Shanghai sell it.

The people of Chaoshan worship the bed god and bed goddess on the morning of the seventh day, burning incense and candles on the bed. They do not do it in the evening, which is also a custom.

### Lingyun Terrace

— Gongsun Wu

The Yingzao Fashi (Building Standards), a specialized work on architecture from a thousand years ago, contains a table of material weights, such as: "Every cubic inch of various stones weighs two mace and three candareens." This must refer to several commonly used stone materials, not to arbitrarily adjust the weight of stones. It also says, "Every cubic inch of white pine wood weighs three candareens and two fen," which is credible. In the past, Emperor Wen of Wei built the Lingyun Terrace, from the building rafters to the ground, it measured thirteen zhang, five chi, seven cun, and five fen. The Shishuo Xinyu (A New Account of the Tales of the World) records the event, saying, "The buildings on the Lingyun Terrace were exquisite. First, the weights of all the wood were measured, and then they were constructed, so that there was no discrepancy. When the terrace was raised, it was difficult to make it tall and steep. It often swayed with the wind, but it never collapsed. When Emperor Ming of Wei ascended the terrace, he feared that it was dangerous and used large timbers to support it, and the building immediately collapsed. Commentators said that this was because the weights were biased." People say that a tall building that sways in the wind must be a good structure, and those who live in it feel at ease. Those that do not sway at the same time are often not guaranteed to be safe in the face of stronger winds. The building on the Lingyun Terrace was probably not very tall in itself, and it was built of wood, so it could not last long. Buddhist pagodas are built of layers of stones, and their lifespan is longer. Today, the Longhua Temple Pagoda in Shanghai is showing signs of tilting, but it still has no tendency to collapse. Although the Leifeng Pagoda in Hangzhou is peeling off, if there were no stone thieves, it would still stand tall today. Zhou built the swirling chambers and tilting palaces, but what they were like, there is no way to know.

### 

The extremely brutal "weapon of destruction" has a surprisingly beautiful name, called "weapon of peace." The originator of this idea had existed for a long time. The Italian Marconi, who succeeded in wireless radio, had considered several "weapons to eliminate war." The American John Hays also said, "The more brutal the weapons, the more people will fear war, which can guarantee peace." Such statements are quite similar to what ancient Chinese sages said, "Establishing power to quell nascent threats," "Using warfare to stop warfare," and "Stopping war is true martial valor," and they are not entirely without reason.

Marconi's ideas were: (1) A destructive mirror, creating a giant convex lens to focus sunlight on one point. Using the heat from this point to reflect onto the enemy army, turning millions of troops into ashes in an instant, melting large ships and heavy artillery, and reducing strongholds and fortifications to scorched earth. (This method may have been inspired by using a convex lens to take fire from sunlight to light cigarettes.) (2) Wireless radio passing through enemy lines, causing them to tremble and collapse, paralyzing and killing them. (3) Terrifying colors, confusing the enemy's emotions, causing them to collapse without a fight. (How does this compare to the disastrous cutting off of water supply at Jieting?) (4) Terrifying rays, reflecting onto the enemy army, causing shock and confusion, also leading to "collapse without a fight," and moreover, "stiffening without being struck." (Even the Golden Light Mother in the Investiture of the Gods could not surpass this.) The above are just "ideas," without any "doing," let alone a successful "device," or any "military experimentation." Marconi was probably too happy with the miraculous effects of wireless radio, so he indulged in his "dream of invention." Hays' words, however, were not mere empty talk. He had created a type of high-heat bomb, far more powerful than German artillery shells that could attack strongholds but could not spread and melt. During the spring of 1945, when American warships approached the Japanese coast, using cannons to bombard the shore, and fires broke out, the Japanese firefighters who went to rescue them were immediately killed. This was the type of shell used, but it was ultimately not as effective as the atomic bomb.

To say that a "weapon of destruction" is a "weapon of peace" is admittedly an exaggeration, but at the end of World War II, the Japanese army gathered a million elite troops to defend their homeland to the death. The plan had already begun to be implemented, and the so-called "cornered beast fighting" was a possible reality at the time. Roosevelt's prediction of the final occupation of Japan was in the summer of 1946. If it were not for the serious warning of the atomic bombs, the war would have been extended by half a year, and the multiple of sacrifices on both sides is unimaginable. Therefore, these two bombs had the effect of shortening the disaster of war.

As for whether the future "atomic" war can rely on the advancement and suppression of "atomic" weapons to make those who understand their strength and know the difficulty wary, and thus maintain peace, it seems that no one can know for sure at this time.
