[Our Report] Yesterday, the President spent the entire day studying the general price and economic situation in this city. He separately met with Shanghai's military and political chiefs, representatives from people's organizations, and financial executives, inquiring about the city's prices, finances, wounded soldiers, refugees, and special relief donations. He expressed particular concern for prices and public order. He instructed Governor Yu of the National Bank in person to strictly crack down on speculation and hoarding, and to take effective financial measures to stabilize prices. He also instructed Police Chief Yu Shuping to strengthen warehouse inspections and pay attention to the livelihood of the police. After completing his official duties, the President and his wife returned to Nanjing by special plane at 9:30 PM yesterday.

The President rose early yesterday morning, around 7:00 AM, and received Mayor Wu at 10:00 AM, followed by Speaker Pan. He inquired about various matters, with each discussion lasting twenty minutes. The President expressed deep concern for General Chen Cheng's health and sent Director Yu Jishi to visit him on his behalf in the morning. Later, upon learning that Chen's recovery was not as rapid as expected, he personally wrote a letter and sent someone to offer his condolences in the afternoon. The President took a short rest in the afternoon. He spent time with relatives from 4:00 PM onward. Kong Lingkan was summoned for an audience, which lasted about forty minutes. Yu Hongjun also arrived at the official residence around 6:00 PM to pay his respects, departing at 6:45 PM. According to Yu, the President was particularly concerned about the price situation in the city and personally instructed that hoarding and speculation be strictly prohibited to stabilize general prices. However, today's discussions were limited to the price issue in this city and were separate from the matters discussed in the meeting at Mogan Mountain. At 7:00 PM, the President and his wife drove along Haige Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and the Bund area of Nanjing Road to inspect the city's appearance and then went to the Shanghai International Cemetery on Hongqiao Road to lay flowers at Madam Soong's tomb.

Properly Arrange for Refugees and Wounded Soldiers; Strive to Solicit Special Relief Donations

At 8:30 PM, the President summoned Central Bank Governor Yu Hongjun, Mayor Wu Guozhen, Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu, City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, City Party Chief Fang Zhi, and Police Chief Yu Shuping for a meeting. He inquired in detail about the situation of the Party, government, military, and people in Shanghai and mentioned matters such as prices, refugees, wounded soldiers, and special relief donations. Mayor Wu and others gave concise reports and described recent handling measures. The President instructed that efforts must be made to stabilize prices. With the new rice about to enter the market, rice prices should be particularly monitored to prevent soaring. The refugee and wounded soldier issues must be discussed with the relevant central authorities as soon as possible to properly arrange for their resettlement, preferably through relocation for farming. From the city's conscription quota, 6,000 men can be allocated for assignment to the Songhu Garrison Brigade to strengthen local public security. There are also proper plans for new recruit barracks, which should be discussed and decided by the city government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of National Defense. Regarding the city's special relief donation quota of 85 trillion, it is considered that this amount has already been greatly reduced based on current prices, and efforts should be made to solicit donations to exceed the original quota, so as to serve as a national model. Mayor Wu and others replied that they had scheduled a meeting within days to actively promote the donation work to meet the expectations of the central government. The meeting ended at 9:10 PM, after which the President and his entourage hurriedly went to Longhua Airport. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and Commander Xuan all went to see them off. Security at the airport was tight. The President and his wife, along with their entourage, boarded a four-engine special plane at 9:30 PM to return to Nanjing.

### New Economic and Financial Policy Plan Is a Prelude to Currency Reform; Possible Announcement and Implementation on the 5th of This Month

[Our Nanjing Office, 31st] The new economic and financial policy plan decided upon at Mogan Mountain may be announced and implemented on August 5th. Rumors that it would be announced and implemented from the 1st have not yet been confirmed by authoritative sources as of the 31st. When Finance Minister Wang Yunwu and Deputy Finance Minister Xu Baiyuan were surrounded by reporters after attending the political affairs meeting on the 31st, both strongly stated that no plan would be announced on the 1st. It is understood that although this plan has been discussed and decided by the President together with Premier Weng, Finance Minister Wang, and Governor Yu, it still needs to be approved by the political affairs meeting, so the announcement date will likely be delayed until around the 5th. As for the content of the plan, authoritative sources have confirmed that it is not an immediate currency reform, but it can be regarded as preparation work for currency reform. This plan includes a comprehensive set of economic and financial measures, and the economic reform process is also the beginning of economic reform. After the implementation of this plan, based on actual needs and objective conditions, another complete set of measures will be gradually implemented until the economy tends to be completely stable and the currency reform is successfully completed. This plan takes financial policy and foreign exchange policy as two major pillars, including the control of the market, the regulation of financial institutions, and the inspection of banks and warehouses, etc. However, this is a peaceful and legal economic policy, not aimed at individuals, and will not adopt confiscation measures, and will never use drastic means. It is believed that this policy will not affect the lives of many people and will have a good impact on the international community. The difference between this plan and the past economic reform plans and economic measures is that this time, a focus approach is adopted, rather than simply focusing on the articles as in the past. At the same time, there is more careful and thorough consideration in advance. According to the financial policy of this plan, in the future, there will be the most thorough management of speculative capital, so that it cannot cause trouble. Illegal lending by banks will be restricted as much as possible, and currency will be suppressed to circulate in the market, so as to achieve the effect of stabilizing prices and stabilizing finance. When the economy is stable and the international and domestic balance of payments are balanced, the currency system will be formally reformed. These measures and plans are the prelude to currency reform.

### Yu Hongjun's Remarks

[Our Report] Central Bank Governor Yu Hongjun was summoned to Mogan Mountain to meet with the President and has returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties. According to Yu, his mission was to discuss concrete measures to stabilize the economy. Since the national budget was passed by the Legislative Yuan, its execution is extremely important, and it is related to finance and economy. How to balance income and expenditure, verify expenditures, increase foreign exchange, improve remittances from overseas Chinese, enrich tax revenue, and how to strengthen financial control and crack down on hoarding and speculation are all topics for discussion. In addition, how various central ministries and commissions should connect, and how the central government and local governments should cooperate, are also comprehensively reviewed. The President has given detailed instructions on the shortcomings of past measures and the future improvement directions. Yu also mentioned that the use of US aid will help improve our economy, but everything should still be based on self-help. The above-mentioned points are all ways to cooperate with US aid to strive for self-help. As for the principles of application, while one side should abide by bilateral agreements, the other side should seek to achieve the goal of stabilizing the economy. All these economic issues have been specifically addressed during this meeting. After the approval of the Executive Yuan, it can be implemented. Finally, Yu said in an optimistic tone: It is expected that exports will increase, and remittances from overseas Chinese are gradually improving. The measures for overseas Chinese capital and domestic residents to invest in domestic production enterprises have been announced and implemented, and domestic production enterprises will have new development. In addition, the second batch of US aid materials can arrive one after another. In the future, the economic situation will definitely tend to stabilize.

[Our Nanjing Office, 31st] President Chiang will host a reception at the new official residence next to the Lingyuan Avenue at 11:00 AM on August 1st to entertain senior government officials and diplomatic envoys stationed in Nanjing, commemorating the restoration of this building after several destructions. The new official residence is located on a small hill on the south side of Lingyuan Avenue, approximately midway between Zhongshan Gate and Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum. It is surrounded by lush trees, with pines and cypresses reaching into the clouds. From a distance, only faint green tiles and red walls can be seen, and it is only upon closer inspection that the superior environment of the garden is discovered, which is extremely quiet and secluded. The entrance to the new official residence is full of rural charm. A gravel road leads from the roadside forest to a small, through-style house inhabited by a concierge. Through this, a slow slope and stone steps lead to the northwest corner in front of the main house of the official residence. Vehicles also have a circular road around to the portico in front of the main house. The main house is named "Christ's Triumphant Song Hall", and the lintel is personally inscribed by the President in gold characters on a vermilion background in November 1947, which is full of ancient charm. Entering the door is a reception room, and behind it is a sky hall. Outside the hall is a veranda. The entire building is a three-story palace-style building, covered with flying eaves, painted rafters, carved railings, and glazed blue tiles. The vermilion giant pillars are high and majestic, which is extremely beautiful to behold. The scenery on the veranda is especially good. Leaning on the white stone railing engraved with phoenixes, facing the embroidered green fields, the Veterans' School is on the right, and the National Chengchi University is on the left, where the sound of music can be heard. In front is an endless expanse of fields, and the gentle breeze blows the rice, with thousands of heads bowing. Looking south, Maoshan seems to be in a painting. Between morning and evening, it is like a touch of light indigo, blending into the clouds, which makes people think a lot about the mountains and rivers. It is said that this new official residence was built by Yang Xiaotian before the war and offered to the former National Government. Only the late Chairman Lin once lived there as an official residence. When the capital was moved west, it was abandoned. During the enemy's occupation, it was once stationed by the Japanese army. After the victory, it was once occupied by bandits. After nine years of looting, it was severely damaged. When the National Government returned to the capital, the Military Affairs Bureau of the Office of the Military Counselor hired workers to carry out repairs, which took two and a half years to restore its original appearance, and it was re-honored as the President's new residence.

### On the Budget for the Second Half of the Year – Also Discussing Financial and Monetary Reform Policies –

The draft budget for the second half of this year has been submitted by the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan for review and discussion, and is undergoing final approval. According to the Ministry of Finance, the total estimated amount of the budget is approximately 10 trillion 法幣, with tax revenue estimated at 5 trillion 法幣 and a deficit of approximately 5 trillion 法幣. In the extraordinary financial situation of suppressing the rebellion, being able to maintain a 50/50 ratio between debt and revenue is already a remarkable phenomenon. Moreover, after the Legislative Yuan increases revenue and reduces expenditures, the deficit will naturally be even smaller. However, these are estimated figures for the budget, not the actual amounts received and spent by the national treasury, let alone the final accounting figures. Therefore, whether it can maintain the 50/50 ratio between tax and debt naturally remains a question.

We will first examine the total amount of the national budget for this half-year. Is it sufficient based on the recent trend of rising prices? Recent prices are approximately 4 million times higher than in the first half of 1937 before the war. If this total budget amount is converted to 法幣 based on the price index before the war, it is actually worth only 250 million 法幣 before the war. Furthermore, if it is converted based on today's black market exchange rate for the US dollar, it is worth only US$125 million. According to the Ministry of Finance's report, the national treasury's actual expenditures were 1.336 billion 法幣 in 1935 and 1.893 billion 法幣 in 1936. Although there was also internal unrest at that time, the area of suppression was not as large as it is today. Expenditures already required 1.3 billion to 1.8 billion 法幣. Therefore, a budget for the second half of this year that is worth only 250 million 法幣 before the war will, in reality, be difficult to sustain.

Secondly, we will look at the deficit of 5 trillion 法幣 for the second half of this year. If this 5 trillion 法幣 is converted to US dollars at the black market exchange rate, it is worth only US$62.5 million. If tax revenues for this year can be fully remitted to the national treasury, then there should be no need to seek assistance from the Central Bank's Issuing Bureau to cover this deficit. This is because even one-sixth of the total amount of the US aid loan to China would be sufficient to cover it. According to a telegram dated July 11, the United States Aid to China Administration announced that the allocations to China in the third quarter would reach US$60 million to US$70 million. Therefore, the amount of US allocations in the third quarter alone would be sufficient to cover our half-year budget deficit.

However, if we estimate from the perspective of financial resources, the original target for tax revenue in the budget for the second half of this year was 5 trillion 法幣, and US aid was US$400 million. According to the agreement, economic aid accounts for US$275 million and special aid accounts for US$125 million. It is scheduled to be fully allocated from April of this year to April of next year. Let us assume that US$250 million of this amount can be used in this year, which, when converted to 法幣, would be 20 trillion 法幣. In addition, according to a telegram from Nanjing on the 11th, in order to increase the national treasury's revenue in the second half of the year, the Ministry of Finance plans to sell surplus US goods and lend-lease materials worth approximately 157 trillion 法幣, sell enemy and puppet property and materials worth approximately 10 trillion 法幣, and sell Japanese reparations materials worth over 3.7 trillion 法幣. If we only estimate the above-mentioned financial resources, the national treasury's income for the second half of this year could reach 28.7 trillion 法幣. At the same time, due to the ad valorem collection of commodity taxes, revenue may double due to rising prices. In addition, there are state-owned enterprises valued at approximately US$400 million that have been allocated to the Central Bank as reserves for 法幣. If mobilized as wartime financial resources, they would be worth 32 trillion 法幣. Therefore, according to my estimation, if the budget for the second half of this year is compiled based on income, it could reach approximately 70 trillion 法幣, and there would be no need to issue public bonds, let alone seek assistance from the Central Bank's Issuing Bureau.

I believe that if the government is determined and uses this policy of living within its means to maximize budget expenditures, it may be able to achieve the goals of inevitable victory in suppressing the rebellion and inevitable success in nation-building. Merely trying to quell the internal rebellion and complete nation-building with a budget equivalent to 250 million 法幣 before the war is akin to a hypnotic fantasy far removed from reality.

Recently, the Legislative Yuan has been making various cuts to this 10 trillion 法幣 budget, which is equivalent to 250 million 法幣 before the war, making it seem even more out of touch with reality. At the same time, I also feel that the Ministry of Finance's proposal of this 10 trillion 法幣 estimate is not in line with the current situation. I am not talented, but I would like to try to compile a draft budget estimate for the second half of this year based on the principle of living within our means, as follows:

Draft National Budget Estimate for the Second Half of 1948

Revenue Section

1. Tax Revenue (including administrative revenue, etc.): 10 trillion 法幣

2. Loan Revenue (US$250 million): 20 trillion 法幣

3. Revenue from State-Owned Assets

   (1) Revenue from the Sale of Surplus US Goods and Lend-Lease Materials: 3 trillion 法幣
   (2) Revenue from the Sale of Enemy and Puppet Property and Materials: 1 trillion 法幣
   (3) Revenue from the Sale of Japanese Reparations Materials: 500 billion 法幣
   (4) Revenue from the Sale of State-Owned Enterprises: 32 trillion 法幣

4. Revenue from State-Owned Business Profits: 10 trillion 法幣

Total Revenue: 76.5 trillion 法幣

Expenditure Section

1. Military Expenditure: 35 trillion 法幣

2. Economic Construction Expenditure: 25 trillion 法幣

3. Other Government Affairs Expenditure: 16.5 trillion 法幣

Total Expenditure: 76.5 trillion 法幣

Increasing military expenditure can strengthen combat capabilities and boost morale. Increasing economic construction can strengthen national defense, increase national wealth and national income, and also cultivate financial resources. Increasing other government affairs expenditure can raise the salaries of public servants and teachers, thereby enhancing administrative efficiency and maintaining cultural standards.

If the total budget expenditure of 76.5 trillion 法幣 is calculated based on the recent price index of 4 million times, it is approximately 1.9 billion 法幣 before the war. Now that the government has this amount of financial resources, it seems that it can be used to a greater extent, which would allow us to quell the Communist rebellion in one fell swoop. The period of suppressing the rebellion can be shortened, the economic crisis can be eliminated, and the proportion of national wealth and national income can be increased. If the suppression of the rebellion ends, the vast resources of Northeast and North China can be developed, and with the restoration of transportation in various places, the special products of various places can be exchanged with each other, thereby stabilizing prices.

Although China has experienced eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and three years of internal strife, China still has the ability to help itself. Although the Chinese Communist Party occupies a portion of the resource-rich areas of Northeast and North China, they cannot engage in exploitation. Therefore, China's true national wealth is still in the hands of the Chinese state. In addition, the government has US financial assistance, as well as a large amount of enemy and puppet property and materials, Japanese reparations materials, and US surplus goods and lend-lease materials under its control. It also has large-scale state-owned business organizations. Therefore, the country is not truly poor. The reason for its poverty is that some government officials have shaken their confidence and have failed to make good use of its wealth. For example, three years have passed since the end of the Anti-Japanese War, and the 逆産 from enemy and puppet property has still been suspended, with most of it not yet processed. Furthermore, a large amount of government materials are piled up in barren fields, exposed to the wind and rain, without being cherished or valued. Recently, Japanese reparations materials have been continuously shipped in, but we have not heard of the government bidding or selling them to the public. The proverb "starving to death while living next to a rice bin" truly describes the current government!

In recent years, the greatest negative impression the public has of the government's finances is the vast disparity between budget and national treasury revenue and expenditure figures. On the one hand, this is due to the continuous rise in prices, which has led to repeated supplementary budgets through emergency orders. On the other hand, it is due to the government's lack of long-term financial policies, resulting in the mere use of superficial measures to suppress the budget. It must be understood that in this extraordinary period, extraordinary policies must be used to meet extraordinary needs. In an extraordinary period, merely using methods that treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it aches, or even treating the head when the foot aches and the foot when the head aches, is naturally impractical. Due to the government's unsound financial and economic policies, it has lost the trust of the people. Take 法幣 as an example: the reason why prices are rising day by day is that people are unwilling to keep 法幣 in their hands, and it is even more impossible to deposit it in banks. As soon as they have 法幣, they immediately exchange it for goods, gold, foreign currency, or other items such as silver dollars. Precisely because everyone does this, the speed of 法幣 circulation in the market increases, and the amount of circulation also becomes rampant. If everyone trusts 法幣, everyone stores 法幣 in banks, and ordinary banks do not use deposits for hoarding, speculation, or purchasing gold and US dollars, then the bank can restore its original function of controlling the public's purchasing power, and the financial market will surely return to normal, prices will tend to stabilize, and the public's 法幣 purchasing power will remain stable. Therefore, the government's financial and economic policies today should make absolutely stopping the issuance of more 法幣 the primary goal. (Continued on page 5)

### The Collapse of the Heyuan Dyke in Xiangyin Causes Over a Thousand Deaths; Flooding in Northern Hunan Recurrence After the Initial Disaster

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 31st] The river tide in Xiangyin rose sharply on the night of the 29th, causing the collapse of the Heyuan Dyke, encompassing over 40,000 acres. Due to the darkness of the night, the loss of human lives, livestock, and property was extremely heavy. Of the more than 2,000 people in the entire dike area, only 1,000 escaped.

[Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 31st] The water level in Wuhu today is 11.15 meters. To date, only one section of the Jiangdi dike in Anhui Province, the Tongrendi, has collapsed. Wangjiang and Susong have suffered approximately 200,000 mu of damage, while other counties have suffered damage to 10,000 or 20,000-30,000 mu of rice paddies each. Initial estimates do not exceed 1 million mu, which is only one-twentieth of the rice paddies in the Anhui section of the Yangtze River. Currently, new rice from northern Anhui has been launched on the market, with a price of 30 million 法幣. A large batch is expected to arrive in fifteen days. With the current water level slightly rising in the upper reaches and gradually falling in the lower reaches, and with the hot and sunny weather, it is hoped that a major disaster can be avoided.

### The Entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is Connected; The Main Artery of Transportation in Southeastern China is Thus Completed; Engineering Trains Will Run Temporarily, and Official Operations Will Commence After Slight Adjustments

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, from Hangzhou to Zhuzhou, was connected on the 31st. The road connects the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway to the east and the Guangdong-Hankou railway to the west. The total length of the main and branch lines, including the 南潯 railway, is 1,153 kilometers. The main railway network in southeastern China has thus been completed. The road was actually completed in the year of victory in the Anti-Japanese War, but the repair work was arduous due to subsequent Communist damage. It has now been completed due to the material issues. Currently, the newly built Nanping section, the last section to be connected, will temporarily run engineering materials trains. Official operations will begin after slight adjustments. From then on, it will be possible to travel from Nanjing to Hangzhou via this road to Zhuzhou, and then transfer to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to Kowloon, a total distance of approximately 2,300 kilometers. It is also possible to connect with the Xiang-Gui Railway from Hengyang on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, travel 538 kilometers to Liuzhou, and then connect to the Qian-Gui Railway, travel 460 kilometers to Duyun in Guizhou. Therefore, starting from Nanjing, it is possible to reach the southeastern and southwestern provinces by relying on the railway alone. Land transportation south of the Yangtze River will be greatly facilitated. Agricultural, industrial, and mineral products from all along the road can also be transported and circulated more easily, which is of great benefit to the economy, politics, and culture.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 31st] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is 1,153 kilometers long and is a major transportation artery in the east-west direction. The entire track-laying project was completed at 10:00 AM on the 31st. The track was joined at Shangqiao, Yichun, in Nanchuntuo. According to Director Hou of the Railway Bureau, the two major bridges of Zhangshu and Yuanshui have not yet been completed. The steel beams for the former will be shipped from Canada in September and temporarily carried over. The steel beams for the latter have already been transported to Guangzhou and are awaiting shipment. Once this bridge is completed, the entire line can be opened to traffic.

[Another Telegram] The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau believes that Communist unrest has been increasing recently, making it difficult to protect important areas and bridges along the line with road police, so it has telegraphed the Quzhou绥署 to ensure traffic safety.

### Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Repairs Completed and Traffic Resumes; Passenger and Freight Rates Adjusted Today

### Investigation into the Truth of the July 5th Incident; Qin Dechun Flies to Beiping This Morning; The July 5th Investigation Committee Announces That the Investigation Has Yielded Results

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Vice Minister Qin Dechun, who was appointed to go to Beiping to investigate the July 5th Incident, is scheduled to fly to Beiping on the morning of the 1st.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Regarding the aftermath of the July 5th incident involving students from Northeast China, Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan had previously sent telegrams to the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Garrison, Dong Wenqi, the Mayor of Fanyang, and Liu Yaozhang, the Mayor of Beiping, and instructed the Ministry of Education to provide guidance on how to handle the matter properly. It is now learned that, out of caution, the Executive Yuan has, in addition to sending Vice Minister Qin Dechun to Beiping to conduct an on-site investigation of the truth and coordinate the handling, changed the telegrams and sent them separately from Premier Weng to the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Garrison and the Commander-in-Chief of North China. The general idea is: The President is extremely concerned about the July 5th incident involving students from Northeast China and hopes for a proper resolution. In addition to the various measures that have been previously telegraphed, this Yuan has dispatched Vice Minister Qin Dechun to fly to Beiping immediately to investigate the situation on the ground and discuss handling everything.

According to relevant sources, the government has always been extremely concerned about students from Northeast China and has taken measures to improve their living conditions. In early June of this year, the Executive Yuan specially allocated 100 billion 法幣 in emergency funds for universities in Northeast China, which were handed over to the Northeast Bandit Suppression Headquarters for unified management. Subsequently, the Ministry of Education was instructed to advance 61.5 billion 法幣 to Northeastern University in Beiping for the opening expenses of the temporary university and 26 billion 法幣 for student food expenses. Recently, an additional 20 billion 法幣 was allocated for the tuition center and 10 billion 法幣 for the Beiping Temporary High School. The government has allocated a total of over 220 billion 法幣 for students from Northeast China from May to the present, and all of these funds were allocated before the National Budget had been reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan. Given the country's extremely difficult financial situation, it cannot be said that the government's concern for young people in Northeast China is not comprehensive.

[Another Telegram] The Northeast compatriots in Beijing held a tea party at Jieshoutang at 3:00 PM on the 31st to discuss the July 5th incident and welcome Gu Fengxiang, the Northeast Supervisory Commissioner. Archbishop Yu Bin presided over the meeting. Commissioner Gu was invited to attend and report on the reaction of all sectors of Shenyang to the incident and his contact with relevant authorities after arriving in Beijing. The attendees believed that the President was particularly concerned about this matter, and that the Supervisory Yuan and Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan had sent senior officials to investigate the truth. The Central Government had taken wise measures, so they unanimously supported the three measures announced by Premier Weng, but hoped that they would be implemented quickly and seriously so that the incident could be resolved legally and reasonably.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 31st] The July 5th Incident Investigation Committee announced: The investigation work has yielded results and is currently drafting a report. It is reported that the work is progressing smoothly, and the investigation results are not far from what the Northeast people claimed. The so-called first shot is no longer the main issue; the main issue is the death of students. Zhang Baozi and others from the Shenyang Senate, representatives of the people of Northeast China, are still in Beiping. Chuan 日電蒋总统请速处理此问题.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 31st] The central government attaches importance to the July 5th incident. Premier Weng telegraphed Gao Xibing, the Deputy Chairman of the Political Committee, and others on the 30th, expressing his determination to take responsibility for properly handling and resolving the matter fairly to avoid escalating the situation.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 31st] The Northeast Political Committee convened a meeting of the leaders of various provinces and cities and the members of the July 5th Northeast People's Support Association at 10:00 AM on the 31st to discuss the August 1st protest rally and demonstration by the people of Shenyang against the July 5th tragedy. The leaders expressed that they should wait for the central government's reply and postpone taking action. The representatives of the Support Association believed that it was necessary to express their attitude, so the protest rally and demonstration on the 1st will be held.

### Allied Headquarters Disregards the Interests of Other Countries and Establishes a Japanese Trade Policy; Wu Bannong Straightforwardly Criticizes It

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] Shi Huanke, the recently arrived US Vice Consul in Shanghai, visited Wu Bannong, the head of the Economic Group of the Chinese delegation and Chairman of the Compensation and Restitution Commission, today to discuss Sino-Japanese trade issues. It is reported that during the meeting, Wu directly criticized the Allied Headquarters for disregarding the interests of other Far Eastern countries and establishing a Japanese trade policy, which he said was a shortsighted action. Wu pointed out that the biggest obstacle to Sino-Japanese trade was the Allied Headquarters' intention to use the imports of other Chinese government agencies to offset the US$10 million debt of the Central Trust Bureau. As a result, the Chinese 資委會 sold iron ore to foreign companies, which resold it to the Allied Headquarters, instead of selling it directly to the Allied Headquarters. The CTB is currently continuing to ship goods from China to Japan and plans to clear its debt within the year. Therefore, the policy adopted by the Allied Headquarters is incomprehensible. When discussing the Allied Headquarters' disregard for the interests of other countries, Wu pointed out that the Allied Headquarters had rejected the Kailuan Mining Bureau's proposal to exchange coal for Japanese mine timber. Wu said that the Allied Headquarters' reason for rejecting it was to protect Japanese forests as much as possible to prevent fires, but on the other hand, Japanese officials and industrialists expressed their willingness to send representatives to Kailuan to exchange mine timber for coal. Restoring the Yongli Chemical Plant

### New Platinum Mesh Manufactured by Japanese Government

Return of Yongli Chemical Plant

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] The Allied Headquarters will hand over to Yongli Chemical Plant, the largest nitric acid manufacturing plant recently returned to China and highly valued domestically, a newly manufactured platinum mesh in September. The new platinum mesh is currently being manufactured by the Japanese government to replace the seven-jin platinum mesh that was stolen from the plant while it was temporarily kept by Japan before its return. This mesh is an indispensable catalyst for the production of nitric acid and essential for resuming operations. According to the plant's representative here, the plant's reconstruction is expected to be completed by the end of this month. It is also learned that Guangdong Paper Mill, the largest in China, which was completely moved to Hokkaido by Japan during the war, will be completely dismantled before the end of September and transported starting in early October.

### Another Theory on the Cause of the Civilian Aviation Team Plane Burning in Qingdao

Overloading and Uneven Weight Distribution

[This Newspaper] A Civilian Aviation Team transport plane crashed and burned near Qingdao on the 29th. Some speculate that the cause was sabotage by the communists, but this theory does not seem to have sufficient evidence to support it. According to speculation from local sources, overloading may have had a significant impact. Ordinary transport planes have a maximum load of 40,000 pounds, while this plane reached over 46,000 pounds. Witnesses said that when the plane took off and was about 100 feet from the runway, it suddenly rose sharply at a 45-degree angle and then crashed. It is possible that military supplies and other items were piled up in the plane, causing the weight to be unevenly distributed, which caused a malfunction in some of the machinery, leading to the tragedy. The names of the sixteen Chinese officers and soldiers who died are not available here, as the Civilian Aviation Team does not have a passenger list. Although the team is a civilian aviation organization, its nature is relatively special, and this accident does not seem to have caused general panic or condemnation among the public. It is also said that the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Communications has not sent anyone to investigate.

### Yangtze River Short-Haul Steamer Fare Adjustments

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Yangtze River short-haul steamers recently received approval from the Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau to adjust passenger and freight fares starting on the 1st. Freight rates will increase by 150%, and passenger fares will increase by 120%.

[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 31st] Ticket prices for steamer routes from Zhenjiang to northern Jiangsu will increase by 57% starting August 1st. Zhenjiang to Huaiyin will cost 4.13 million yuan.

### Hunan Provincial Assemblymen Request Government to Withdraw Huang Weiguo's Appointment

[This Newspaper, Changsha, 31st] Huang Weiguo, who was appointed to the Hunan Provincial Government by the Executive Yuan, was originally a member of the Kuomintang. Last year, Huang joined the Democratic Socialist Party and ran for the Legislative Yuan, but he was attacked for his origin and lost the election. The Provincial Assembly now believes that Huang is opportunistic and not qualified to lead the people in assisting provincial administration, and twenty-one members, including Qiu Qifan, have requested the government to withdraw the appointment.

### China Airlines to Consult with Allied Headquarters on Revising Sino-American Air Routes; Shortening Route by 300 Miles via Tokyo

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 31st] A representative of China Airlines stationed here said that the company will soon consult with the Allied Headquarters on revising the Sino-American air route to eliminate the Guam stop and instead go via Tokyo, shortening the route by 300 miles. The spokesperson said that it is expected that the Allied Headquarters will soon allow Sino-American airliners to make regular "technical landings" in Tokyo. However, since these landings stipulate that passengers and cargo cannot leave the plane, and those not on board cannot enter the plane, once the Allied Headquarters allows China Airlines planes to make regular technical landings in Tokyo, the company must request Washington, through the Chinese government, to allow "transportation landings" in Tokyo. He also said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has approved China Airlines to operate unscheduled charter flights between Shanghai and Ryukyu, and the Chinese Mission in Japan will soon ask the Allied Headquarters to approve this plan. It is said that an average of 500 passengers per month can be transported between Shanghai and Ryukyu.

### Dalai Lama Holds Grand Assembly to Pray for Victory in Suppressing Rebellion; President Sends Telegram of Commendation

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 30th] In view of the communist bandits' treasonous rebellion and poisoning of the people, the Dalai Lama of Tibet, in order to support the central government's suppression of the rebellion and quickly extinguish the bandit atmosphere, initiated a grand assembly to pray for victory in suppressing the rebellion. This assembly began on July 23rd of the Gregorian calendar and was solemnly held at the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa for three consecutive days. The former and current two Ganden Tripas (the abbot of Ganden Monastery, who inherit the mantle of Master Tsongkhapa) and the two Dharma Kings, Shapa Chokyi and Jangtse Chokyi, presided over the assembly affairs, leading all the Living Buddhas and three thousand monks of the Upper and Lower Tantric Colleges of the Three Great Monasteries in chanting prayers. They also used the supreme power of Tantric Buddhism to light a thousand lamps and piously cultivate the profound "Do-ga" Dharma (this is the most solemn Dharma assembly in Tibet and is not held lightly). In addition, they extensively made offerings in the halls of the most powerful Dharma protectors, such as Jiuqiong Baira Qugadong, to request blessings for miraculous efficacy. At the same time, the Dalai Lama and the Taktra Regent also piously prayed to the Three Great Monasteries. It is reported that before the assembly, the Taktra Regent of Tibet sent a telegram to President Chiang, dispatching Tibetan representatives to pay respects, stating the indignation of the Tibetan political and religious authorities, monks, and people towards the communist bandits' treasonous rebellion and massacre of the people. He also expressed that Tibet is a sacred land of Buddhism and cannot provide military assistance in stopping the communist bandits' insane and brutal acts, but can only pray to the Three Jewels to fundamentally subdue the communist bandits so that the people can enjoy peace and happiness as soon as possible. It is heard that President Chiang has replied with a telegram of commendation and ordered the responsible departments to allocate funds for alms to show encouragement. Chen Xihuang, director of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission's office in Kangding, attended the assembly at the invitation of the three Kalons of the Kashag.

### Soviet Representative's Tough Stance at Danube River Conference; Firmly Rejects Conditions Proposed by Western Countries

[This Newspaper] London, 31st, Broadcast: Belgrade News, Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky denounced the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France at the Danube River Conference for pre-judging the conference. Vishinsky said, "We are now encountering the 'ultimatum-like' final demands of the representatives of the three countries attending this conference. These demands are made before drafting any agreement, without any knowledge of the substance of the proposals and the principles on which the new agreement is based. This is the tone of a dictator, not the language of cooperation, and the Soviet Union will firmly reject it. As far as the Soviet delegation is concerned, we are exasperated by such language that does not conform to international gatherings. We will never consider any pressure that the delegations of the United States, Britain, and France attempt to exert on us."

[This Newspaper] London, 31st, Broadcast: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky told the representatives of the Western powers at the Danube River Conference today that if the powers insisted on proposing conditions, the door was wide open for them to leave. The wording was tough, and the representatives of the Western powers unanimously expressed indignation.

[United Press, Belgrade, 31st] France today challenged the Soviet bloc majority at the Danube River Conference here. French representative Thierry said that the French government would not be bound by any new Danube River Convention unless the signatory countries of the current Danube River Statute (including the United States) unanimously agreed. He also said that even though the majority faction is powerful, it cannot change the current statute. It is reported that this is the first time that the Soviet bloc has held a majority in an East-West conference. Thierry's statement opened a discussion of procedural rules. Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kamenov was the chairman of the conference today.

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 30th] After the opening ceremony of the Danube River Conference today, the language issue caused a dispute between the Western powers and the People's Democratic Republics. The conference decided that Russian and French would be the official languages, not English, which was only considered the third working language. The conference was opened by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Shemik, and then Soviet representative Vishinsky proposed the above motion. After three hours of debate, it was passed by a vote of seven to three (United States, Britain, and France). Subsequently, the conference unanimously appointed Mez, Director of the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as Secretary-General. The Yugoslav Foreign Minister said in his opening speech that he wished to take this opportunity to state that the Yugoslav government hoped that the outcome of this conference could prove the possibility of establishing international peaceful cooperation between countries with mutually non-interfering economic systems, and prove that it is often possible to reconcile the interests of the Danube River's fully sovereign countries, which are linked by the river's transport. Yugoslavia has proven by deeds rather than empty words its determination to participate in the task of seeking international unity and economic cooperation on the basis of complete equality. He then proposed that each day's meeting should be chaired by the delegations in turn.

[TASS, Belgrade, 30th] The list of heads of delegations from countries participating in the Danube River Conference is as follows: Soviet Union, Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky; Ukraine, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Marminovsky; Czechoslovakia, Foreign Minister Clementis; Romania, Foreign Minister Anna Pauker; Hungary, Foreign Minister Molnar; Bulgaria, Foreign Minister Kamenov; United States, Ambassador to Yugoslavia Cannon; Britain, Ambassador to Yugoslavia Baker; France, Expert Thierry; Yugoslavia, Deputy Foreign Minister Biberle. Austria only sent one observer to attend.

### U.S. Special Envoy Seeks Way to Meet Stalin Directly; Also Holds Separate Talks with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister

[This Newspaper] Washington, 31st, Broadcast: A U.S. State Department spokesman said that the envoys of the United States, Britain, and France visited the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs one after another on the 30th to discuss the Berlin issue. He said that this meeting was the first step for the Western countries to seek to lift the Berlin blockade plan. He declined to reveal the nature of the meeting, only saying that U.S. Ambassador Smith visited Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin at 6 p.m., French Ambassador Chateau visited four hours later, and Britain was represented by Roberts and Harrison, the Chargé d'affaires of the British Embassy in the Soviet Union, who met with Zorin at 10 p.m. Based on the speculation on the situation after Molotov refused to meet the three strong envoys on the grounds of "being on vacation" and the three-nation representatives held talks with Zorin, the envoys of the United States, Britain, and France may seek other ways to negotiate the Berlin issue directly with Stalin.

[United Press, Washington, 30th] It is reported that the United States, Britain, and France are willing to discuss the Berlin blockade issue directly with Stalin. According to a report from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, Foreign Minister Molotov is currently on vacation" and therefore "cannot" make decisive discussions. If Stalin is also unable to meet, people here believe that Moscow should bear full responsibility for any events caused by the blockade. Representatives of the Western countries want to meet with Molotov to present the three powers' opinions on the blockade and inquire about the price the Soviet Union is asking for to stop the blockade. It is believed that if the Soviet Union agrees to lift the blockade, they will propose discussions on Berlin, Germany, and other European issues. The United States undoubtedly supports direct meetings with Stalin, as the possibility of the situation exploding is very high and cannot be fully handled by diplomatic staff. The State Department declined to comment on whether Molotov's vacation was a "dodge."

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th] Opinions in political and diplomatic circles here believe that Molotov's departure from Moscow has several explanations. One is that the Kremlin learned that the Western allies intended to make concessions to the Soviet Union, so it decided to buy time and increase the number and nature of those it was holding if four-nation talks were held. Another, more optimistic opinion is that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky is attending the opening ceremony of the Danube River Conference in Belgrade today. This postponement will allow Vishinsky to have the opportunity to contact the U.S. delegation at the conference.

### Currency and Food War in East and West Berlin

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 30th] Berlin's "food rationing war" entered a new stage today. The East Zone food administration announced that the Soviet authorities in the West Zone also did not intend to ration special food rations that had been abolished by the Western authorities. The Soviet ADN news agency claimed that West Zone residents registered in the Soviet Zone could receive normal rations, including cigarettes, matches, and soap.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 30th] Berlin's "Mark war" also had a new development today. The Soviet authorities ordered the freezing of all deposits of West Zone industrialists in Berlin city banks.

### Szakasits Expected to Succeed Hungarian President; Communist Party Excludes Dissidents

The Communist Party will propose two motions at that time to win more power: one is to nominate Szakasits, and the other is to seize the Ministry of Agriculture from the Smallholders Party. It is reported that the party still advocates private property rights. According to the constitution, the new President will be elected by parliament within 30 days, which is expected to be held next Tuesday.

### U.S. Republican Lawmakers Oppose Price Controls; Plan to Urge Congress to Adjourn Early

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th] Senate Republican Policy Committee Chairman Taft announced today that he hopes the Senate can adjourn on August 7th. He also said that he is absolutely opposed to price controls, but he supports Truman's plan to limit bank loans.

[United Press, Washington, 30th] When Taft issued the above statement, it was at a time when other Republican lawmakers were quickly overturning the recommendations of Democratic lawmakers. Members of the People's Livelihood Party had proposed inviting Republican presidential candidate Dewey to Congress to state his views on rising prices. At the same time, those in the Senate who were adopting delaying tactics on public authority issues continued their strategies. Taft expects to "deal with" the anti-poll tax bill on August 4th, but Zhu explained how to deal with it.

### Soviet Union Tempts German Industry to Cooperate with Electricity and Raw Materials

[United Press, Berlin, 31st] On the 31st, the Soviet Union tempted the Berlin industry, which was suffocating under the blockade, to cooperate with the Soviet Union by supplying electricity and raw materials. This suggestion was first seen in the Soviet-backed "Greater Berlin Trading Company," and then the Soviet German News Agency spread it. The agency said that if the German industry in the British, American, and French sectors is willing to follow the Soviet Union's lead, the Greater Berlin Company should supply the necessary supplies, including electricity, and guarantee that the Soviet occupation zone and control zone can be its markets.

### Communist Leader Criticizes Government; Italian Prime Minister Refutes Sharply; Vows to Protect Democracy and Resist Violence

[United Press, Rome, 30th] Italian Prime Minister Gasperi, with a flushed face and anger, shouted at the Italian Communist Party in Parliament on the evening of the 30th to stop propagating revolution, otherwise they would have to bear the consequences themselves. Communist leader Longo had accused the parliament, and Gasperi gave a twenty-minute impromptu reply, saying: "I am now warning Longo to stop advancing towards violence. If your excellency wants to threaten all classes of people who want to protect their assets and rights, then I can tell you that our responsibility is not only to protect democracy, but also to protect the people and the working class from this terror, and even to encourage them to have the courage to fight. " This was Gasperi's most combative speech since taking office as Prime Minister.

Longo read a document criticizing Gasperi and the parliament for an hour, and it is said that this document was written by Togliatti. Gasperi's powerful reply shocked Longo. When Longo mentioned the Communist Party's motion of no confidence in the government, he said that the motion had been withdrawn, "because the government party has a majority, so any discussion in parliament is useless at all." Longo criticized the government's control of the parliament and said: "The government has adopted dangerous policies. The government's laws prohibiting the private possession of arms and other police state measures have led the government down the path followed by the Nazis and fascists." Longo's words angered Gasperi, who stood up and refuted.

### Economic and Social Council Discusses Asian Economic Association Report

### Taft Advocates Steel Should Be Allotted to China

[United Press, Washington, 30th] Republican Senator Taft told the Senate today that he believes the United States "should allot steel for export to South America and China before allotting steel to domestic factories." When asked whether exporting steel to South America and China would affect the increase in steel prices, Taft did not think so. He said that reducing exports would not suppress its price, because domestic demand in the United States would absorb all steel. However, increasing the supply of steel would increase the quantity of steel products. Taft said that he advocated saving the expenses of various government departments, including the expenses of the Economic Cooperation Administration, and believed that the President should save as much as possible within the existing office expenses. He said that the President has the right to reduce the export of steel and other scarce materials without the consent of Congress.

### Mystery of Soviet Foreign Minister's Whereabouts; Rumored to be Attending Comintern Meeting Somewhere

[United Press, Trieste, 31st] "The Trieste Daily" Paris on the 31st reported that some people believe that Molotov is now in "a certain place in Eastern Europe" to attend a new meeting of the Comintern.

It also said that French Communist Party leader Duclos recently did not participate in the talks between French Communist Party leader Thorez and President Auriol, so "these three major Communist Party figures" are attending a meeting of the Comintern in a certain place in Eastern Europe to discuss the Italian situation after the assassination attempt on Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti and Tito's reply to the Comintern. The newspaper's Paris reporter is one of the top political reporters in Italy.

### American Espionage Activities During Wartime Involving Lippmann

American Spy Girl Reveals to the Senate

[Our Newspaper's Report] Washington, 31st Broadcast - Regarding the case of Remington, an official of the U.S. Department of Commerce, accused of leaking war secrets to Soviet spies, U.S. Senators summoned Remington to the Senate Investigating Committee office for questioning on the 31st. Remington, looking around with wide eyes, declared before even taking the witness stand that the accusation was "not factual."

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th] The mysterious American woman, Bentley, confessed that a high-ranking official in the U.S. Treasury Department was, in fact, one of the leaders of Soviet spies in the United States, providing the Soviets with intelligence on the B-29 Superfortress. According to a photograph published in the Communist Party newspaper, the Daily Worker, Bentley is a middle-aged woman with deep black hair. Sources familiar with the matter say that the spy network revealed by Bentley is more extensive than the Canadian atomic spy case. Some quarters indicate that Bentley's revelations are related to the recent arrests of Communist leaders. However, others strongly deny this, asserting that the Communist leaders have all been released on bail. Bentley is no longer a beautiful young woman, but an obese woman. She testified before the Senate Un-American Activities Committee that from 1935 to 1944, under the instructions of the Communist Party, she provided political and military intelligence to the Soviet Union. She pointed out that Remington, a senior official in the Department of Commerce (at the time, Chairman of the Export License Review Board for Europe), had leaked detailed information about American aircraft production to her during the war. A copy of this confidential information was made by the well-known journalist Lippmann, formerly of the Department of Commerce, and given to her. Lippmann is currently in North Carolina. Bentley also stated that her contact with Soviet spies was due to her belief in communism, and she felt that the United States was not providing sufficient assistance to the Soviet Union.

### Bernadotte Prepares to Draft New Arab-Jewish Peace Plan; Will Also Attend UN Assembly to Report on Situation in the Holy Land

[U.S. Information Service, Lake Success, 30th] United Nations Mediator Count Bernadotte announced today that he will begin his journey to the capitals of Arab countries and Israel on Sunday to determine the reactions of these countries to the basic principles of a new peace plan for Palestine. In his report to the United Nations from his headquarters on Rhodes, Bernadotte did not reveal the details of the new proposals for resolving the Palestinian issue. It was also announced that the UN mediator has requested to personally attend and report on the situation in Palestine at the next UN General Assembly, and this has been approved by the United Nations. Bernadotte's report stated that the new ceasefire in Palestine is being observed by both sides, although there are occasional reports of incidents. He also said that the network of ceasefire observers is rapidly expanding throughout the Holy Land. After visiting Israel and the Arab countries, Bernadotte plans to return to Sweden to attend the International Red Cross Conference held in Stockholm. After returning to Rhodes from Sweden, he will complete a draft peace plan that may be approved by the Jews and Arabs.

### Japanese Cabinet Promulgates Anti-Strike Law, Likely to Incite General Strike; Labor Circles Believe MacArthur's Letter Is Not Law

[United Press, Tokyo, 31st] The Japanese Cabinet promulgated an order on the 31st prohibiting government employees from striking, even though labor leaders have warned that such an action would order five million public and private workers nationwide to strike in retaliation. The Cabinet order is based on the recommendations in MacArthur's letter to Prime Minister Ashida on the 22nd.

The Cabinet's "no-strike" order takes immediate effect and will remain in force until the National Public Service Law is amended by the passage of new legislation in the Diet. Labor leaders have long declared that they do not intend to comply unless the Diet passes the "no-strike" order, so the Cabinet's order is likely to heighten tensions. The labor circle's rhetoric is technically and legally on the verge of defying MacArthur's rule. Observers believe the Allied Headquarters will definitely stand up to support the Cabinet's "no-strike" law.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 31st] According to today's public announcement, the leaders of the three coalition parties of the Japanese government have reached complete agreement on the contents of the future anti-strike law. Prime Minister Ashida held consultations in the Diet this afternoon with former Prime Minister Katayama and Democratic Party President Miki. The three party leaders decided that the Diet will convene in mid-September for a session of approximately 20 days to pass the government ordinance amending the status of civil servants based on MacArthur's request and formulated by the Japanese government.

[United Press, Tokyo, 31st] Five million Japanese workers have declared that they will strike in state-owned and private factories. The chairman of the Japan Transport Workers' Union and member of the "Central Struggle Committee" of government employee unions, Tsuchiji, stated at a meeting with Allied journalists that Japanese workers firmly oppose the implementation of MacArthur's "labor restriction" letter simply through a cabinet order without Diet approval. He stated that if the government does so, five million Japanese workers will immediately strike.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 31st] The leader of the Japan Industry Workers' Congress, Tsuchibashi, told Allied journalists this morning that a general strike of postal and transport workers will take place on August 7th. He stated that he does not recognize MacArthur's letter to Prime Minister Ashida as a formal order. "If this letter has more authority than the Constitution, then Japan is no longer a country ruled by law." He praised the resignation of Killen, chief of the Allied Headquarters Labor Division, in protest against the anti-strike legislation.

### Japanese Maritime Police Threatens the Nation

### Korea Requests the U.S. to Provide Military Supplies to Defend Against North Korean Attacks; New Government to Apply for Membership in the United Nations

She expects this to happen before the United Nations General Assembly in Paris in September. She also revealed that the Korean government has applied for a loan from the United States and is quite close to obtaining it. She hopes that the government can control the entire Korean peninsula, but it will take time.

### Newfoundland Joins the Canadian Federation

Although United Press sources did not list the specific points of contention, it is generally believed that the Philippines hopes to obtain the maximum protection for its industrialization plan and therefore opposes the expansion of American business.

### A Soviet Veteran's Oral Account of Stalin's War Plan (Part 2)

— Translated by Our Newspaper's Editorial Department

In addition, the Soviet high command knew that the United States had established radar-like equipment in bases near the Soviet Union (such as Turkey, Greece, China, and Germany). Using this equipment, the United States could detect the location of Soviet atomic bomb factories. To prevent leaks, a large number of "anti-atomic radar" equipment is being actively constructed.

Secondly, the Soviet General Staff was concerned about the oil problem. Given the possibility of the United States using atomic bombs to destroy Soviet offshore oil fields, a huge metal net was placed along the Caspian Sea coast. The placement of this net could prevent radio-controlled atomic bombs from bombarding Soviet oil fields.

V-Weapons While the Soviet Union's achievements in atomic bombs lagged behind the United States, its advantage in V-weapons far surpassed that of the United States. In a recent test near a Siberian test station close to the Kamchatka Peninsula, this type of automatically propelled long-range aerial weapon was able to accurately attack a "target" approximately three to five miles wide within a distance of 900 to 1,300 miles without fail.

As is well known, the main strength of the Soviet Union lies in its massive army. Marshall recently said: "All American combat troops can comfortably sit in a Brooklyn basketball court without feeling crowded." According to the secret instructions of the Soviet General Staff, by the end of 1948, the Soviet Union's peacetime standing army will reach as many as 120 divisions, including 30 airborne divisions, 20 armored divisions, 40 infantry divisions (of which 25 are mechanized), 15 cavalry divisions (of which 8 are mechanized), and 15 artillery divisions (of which 10 are mechanized). The disparity in strength is vast, with the United States lagging far behind the Soviet Union.

In addition, in order to defend their industry and avoid atomic bombing, the Soviet Union is also planning to build two to three times as many railways. In this way, when a region's industry is temporarily destroyed, its equipment can be immediately transferred to another region to continue production. At the same time, because the Soviet Union's industry is dispersed in vast areas, the threat of atomic bombs is greatly reduced.

Indeed, the atomic bomb is not enough to give the Soviet Union a headache. What the Soviet Union is really uneasy about is not the atomic bomb, but the oil problem. If the oil fields are destroyed at the beginning of the war, the Soviet Union will have no way to obtain enough fuel to complete its three stages of war. If the Soviet Union can only complete the first stage and cannot complete the second stage, then the initiative in the war will inevitably fall into the hands of the United States. At the same time, the original plan to conduct a decisive battle in China alone will also fail. In this way, it will be forced to fight simultaneously in three areas: Chinese mainland, the Near East, the Middle East, and Europe (from Spain to the UK). The danger of fighting on three fronts may lead to tragic consequences. In the event of misfortune, if the war develops to this point, then the Soviet Union will inevitably adopt a long-term war strategy. Because of this possibility, the Soviet Union cannot help but anticipate the outbreak of the next war with great fear.

### General Household Re-Registration Starts Tonight; Lasts for Ten Days; Over 10,000 Personnel Deployed; First Day to Investigate Mobile Population in the City

[Our Newspaper's Report] The city's general household re-registration is scheduled to start from midnight tomorrow morning (i.e., midnight tonight) and will last for ten days. The target of the first day's investigation is the city's mobile population, such as those staying in hostels, inns, and homeless people wandering the streets. According to statistics, about 10,000 or more civilian police, bureau police, and personnel from various districts will be deployed for the investigation. In order to facilitate the investigation and avoid confusion, citizens found cooling off in the streets or sleeping in the open will be advised to return to their homes. It is said that this work must be completed before dawn. From 8:00 a.m. on August 2, the on-land household registration will be conducted in an organized manner. Staff members will carry household registration forms and conduct household registration according to the street address order. For the boat dwellers on the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek, the Maritime Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau will dispatch 20 speedboats to conduct investigations section by section. In addition, the key points of this general household re-registration are as follows: (1) During the re-registration period, those who fail to report omissions of households or persons will be required to purchase the application form prescribed by the Municipal Government, complete the application procedures, and fill in the changes on the spot according to their type of migration. (2) Those who have moved out of the household registration without prior report will be exempted from filling out the application form, and the Jia chief will apply on their behalf. (3) During the re-registration period, identity cards will be checked. Those who have not obtained an identity card, regardless of men, women, old or young, will be issued an identity card application form on the spot and will be required to submit photos and apply for identity cards in accordance with the prescribed procedures before August 11. (4) During this re-registration period, households that have not been declared due to unclear procedures or other minor reasons will be exempted from investigation, except for a face-to-face order to complete the procedures. However, those who are subsequently found to have omitted households or persons, or who fail to register changes in personnel within three days, will be punished according to law.

Police Department Conducts Surprise Identity Checks on Military Personnel

(Another Report) In order to assist the Municipal Government in completing the general household re-registration and to cooperate, the Police Department has decided to jointly strengthen and expand the surprise identity checks on military personnel with the 9th Gendarmerie Regiment starting on August 2 to prevent illegal elements from taking the opportunity to impersonate military personnel to evade household re-registration. At that time, the Garrison Department and the Gendarmerie Regiment will dispatch all personnel to conduct checks at major traffic arteries and entertainment venues. Once illegal elements are found to be impersonating military personnel, they will be taken into custody for investigation.

### Chief Statistician Reports on Price Increases

The Shanghai Municipal Cost of Living Index Review Committee held its 16th meeting in the Municipal Government Conference Room at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The Chief Statistician reported on price increases as follows: Prices increased by less than 20% for green vegetables and cigarettes. Prices increased between 21% and 30% for indica rice, leeks, salted fish, and tea. Prices increased between 31% and 40% for tofu and bean oil. Prices increased between 41% and 50% for flour, fresh beef, fermented bean curd, and twill. Prices increased between 51% and 60% for soybeans, coarse cloth, and flannel. Prices increased between 61% and 70% for bean sprouts, matches, serge, and soap. Prices increased between 71% and 80% for shilin cloth and straw paper. Prices increased between 81% and 90% for fresh fish and socks. There was no change in the prices of public utilities and household rationed rice in the second half of July.

Prepared Separately for the First and Second Halves of the Month

Zhang Zongmeng, Chief Statistician of the Municipal Government, stated to reporters after presiding over the Cost of Living Index Review Committee yesterday: After the cost of living index for this city was published in two phases for July, some people mistakenly believed that the index for the second half of the month represented the entire month of July. The calculation and preparation methods for the indices for the first and second halves of July are completely independent, which is the same as the previous situation of publishing the index on a monthly basis. In addition, there was no change in the prices of public utilities and household rice in the second half of July, and the prices of goods even fell for one week, so the price increase in this period was relatively stable.

### Nylon Stockings Sealed Up Pending Disposal

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was the last day for selling nylon stockings.

China will continue to ship 40,000 tons of sugar and tens of thousands of tons of salt, iron sand, etc. to Japan for barter trade. The Communist China Trust Bureau has determined that this transportation work will be jointly undertaken by China and Japan. The shipping industry in our country has expressed its opposition to this and has made a request to the bureau to protect the domestic shipping industry. All goods for barter trade with Japan should be transported by the shipping industry. The Barter Trade Department of the Central Trust Bureau is currently considering this.

### Deeply Feeling the Pain of Being Deprived of Education, Generously Donates 100 Million Yuan to Help Students

Yesterday afternoon, a businessman-like person came to our newspaper office and donated 100 million yuan as a "reader scholarship." He said that because his family was poor when he was young, he was deprived of education after reaching the elementary school level. Over the past 20 years, because he was determined to work hard, he gradually consolidated his economic status. Although he cannot be called wealthy at present, he is able to make a sufficient living. Recalling the pain of being deprived of education in his youth, he expressed particular sympathy and concern for the impoverished students in society. The 100 million yuan he is donating now is entirely his savings from frugality, and today he donates all of it as a scholarship, which is only a small expression of sympathy.

In this society, there are countless people living a life of luxury, with bright lights, green wine, and spending thousands of dollars at a time. If they could economize on extravagance and use it to help countless poor students, wouldn't it be a very meaningful thing?

### Rampant Venereal Disease in the City: Prostitutes Largely Evading Inspection; Prevention and Treatment Center Strives to Salvage the Situation

[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the lack of thorough management by the authorities, the number of prostitutes in the city has been increasing in recent years along with the dramatic changes in the economic situation. As a result, venereal diseases have become increasingly rampant. Although the city's Venereal Disease Prevention and Treatment Center now conducts monthly inspections of registered public prostitutes, Director Yu Wei told reporters that this work faces many difficulties. Most prostitutes are unwilling to register with the police, with registered prostitutes accounting for only one-tenth of the total. Of those registered, only one-tenth receive timely inspections at the center. Forced treatment cannot be thoroughly implemented. At the same time, many new prostitutes, secret prostitutes, and disguised prostitutes evade inspections in various ways. Currently, the center estimates that it inspects about 3,000 prostitutes per month, but the actual number of prostitutes in the city is at least 100,000 or more. Almost all of them have gonorrhea, and about 65% have syphilis. Furthermore, according to statistics from various sources, about 15% of the city's residents have syphilis, and 40% have gonorrhea. The situation is more serious than tuberculosis. Therefore, even if prostitutes pass the inspection and are allowed to operate, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not contract venereal diseases again within 25 minutes. He said that Hong Kong, with a population of one million, has five venereal disease prevention and treatment centers. This city, with a population of five million, has only one. Therefore, it is difficult to expect satisfactory results in the prevention and treatment of venereal diseases.

Quick Treatment Method: Cured in Ten Days

However, the center is still striving to research quick treatment methods. Using the latest penicillin oil emulsion, injected once a day, early syphilis can be cured in just ten days, with an effectiveness rate of over 96%. Meanwhile, emphasis is placed on education to reduce the chance of transmission as much as possible. In the future, it is planned to conduct home visits to those with venereal diseases, syphilis screening for pregnant women, promote premarital checkups, and select one prostitute from each of 25 brothels for three months of venereal disease education, so that they can be spontaneously aware of the terribleness of venereal diseases and widely learn prevention methods.

Treating 1,100 People Per Month

In addition to regular prostitute inspections, the center is also working to treat venereal diseases among residents. Currently, it treats an average of about 1,500 people per month. Director Yu believes that venereal disease is not an incurable disease and should never be hidden from doctors, as it can harm future generations. To this day, it is a well-known fact that early treatment of venereal disease is very easy to cure.

At present, it is impossible to eliminate venereal disease in a metropolis like this city. However, if all prostitutes are strictly registered, and if, like in European and American countries, red-light districts are designated and properly managed, with those who are sick receiving centralized treatment and those who are not sick being responsible for prevention by the brothel keepers, then it should be possible to reduce the chance of venereal disease transmission to the lowest possible level.

Military Vehicles Must Present Certificates for Gasoline

It is expected that the city's refugees will soon be able to find a place to settle down.

### Child's Lock Charm Snatched; Thief Arrested

At around 3:30 PM on the 27th of last month, in front of No. 168 Zhoujiazui Road in Pudong, police saw Li Wang Xiuying's son, only five years old. Liu, seeing that no one was around, bought a watermelon and gave it to the child, and then snatched his silver lock charm and fled. The child cried incessantly. Xiuying heard the sound and went to check, discovering that the silver lock charm around his neck was gone. She chased after Liu and brought him to the Tilanshan Police Station. According to his confession, on the same morning, he had also robbed Luo Yu Jinlian's son (named Kunzi) of a silver neck ring on Emei Road using the same method and escaped. The branch bureau charged him with robbery and transferred him to the court for investigation.

### On the Budget for the Second Half of This Year

Continued from the Monday Forum on page two

We must understand that China has received considerable international credit and assistance during the War of Resistance and after the war. This international credit, that is, the acquisition of foreign loans, represents the result of the international evaluation of China's national wealth. When foreign countries loan to a country, they consider not only political relations but also economic relations. If China does not possess a considerable amount of national wealth, the amount of international credit it obtains will inevitably be very small. If there are no political relations and only reliance on economic relations, it is possible that nothing will be obtained. However, today's China has only become trusted by foreign countries, but is not trusted by its own people, and is even not trusted by some high officials in the Chinese government itself. This is the strangest phenomenon in the world. It also fully shows the low level of national consciousness among Chinese citizens and even officials. Especially in the expression of the urban market, it fully shows that the actions of ordinary speculators are similar to acts of treason. For example, if it is heard that the negotiations between China and the United States for loans are not going smoothly, the black market price of the US dollar will immediately soar. If it is heard that the government army has suffered a temporary setback on the front line, the prices of all commodities will suddenly soar again. Every move of such political, military, and diplomatic dynamics becomes the speculative material of opportunists. How sad!

I advise government officials and people that we must first recognize how huge the potential value of China's national wealth is. According to my estimation, the value of China's national wealth is approximately two trillion pre-war legal currency. If we calculate today's legal currency based on a 4 million-fold increase in prices, it is worth 8 million trillion legal currency. This includes 1.34677 trillion pre-war legal currency of China's underground resources. China is actually not poor. If it were a poor country, Japanese imperialism would never have been willing to devote all its efforts to attempt to conquer China. Now, the government has neither the advanced technology to develop underground resources, nor the ability to manage the state-owned property already on the ground due to the ignorance and incompetence of the responsible officials. It cannot focus on key areas when spending, and only knows how to follow the past and use issuance to make up for deficits. The national finance will naturally decline. Using issuance to fill wartime financial resources is recognized in both wartime financial facts and theories, but it is necessary to know that after using issuance, it must be matched with public debt policies and tax policies. Because wartime military needs are vast and urgent, if the income from taxes and public debt is used for expenditure again, it will have a great impact on military affairs. Therefore, increasing income through issuance first, and secretly using the purchasing power created by the government to purchase military supplies and labor from the market, was originally a temporary measure, not a permanent policy. Now the government has been implementing this temporary emergency measure of inflation policy for too long, and has become accustomed to it. The people are well aware of this situation, so the credibility of legal currency is gradually declining, so that today no one believes in legal currency. Because the credibility of legal currency is gradually declining, the government is also panic-stricken, and has never made a fundamental plan. The people actually believe that China is on the eve of economic collapse. As the facts have evolved to this day, the government is still continuing to expand the issuance of legal currency by continuing to make mistakes, but the scope of legal currency circulation is becoming narrower and narrower, and the speed of circulation is getting faster and faster. People have unconsciously established another kind of "currency" to replace legal currency, such as commodities, gold, silver dollars, foreign currencies, etc. Under this situation, if the government continues to be ignorant and continue to use the inflation policy, this is really a measure to deceive oneself to the extreme!

In my opinion, if we compare the total accumulated amount of legal currency issued today with the rate of price increases, the actual value of the amount of legal currency issued is only five to ten times lower than before the war. The amount of legal currency issued in my country before the war was approximately 1.4 billion yuan. If we convert today's legal currency at 4 million times the price, the amount of legal currency issued today should be 5.6 million trillion yuan. And before the war, the Northeast and Taiwan were not included. If the amount of legal currency issued today includes the circulating notes in the Northeast and the Taiwan dollar, the total amount may not have reached 1 trillion. Since the amount of legal currency issued has not reached the saturation point, why is there a feeling in the market that legal currency is flooded in the market? This point is enough to prove that due to the decline in the credibility of legal currency, the scope of legal currency circulation has become narrower and narrower. Today, the market and the people have invisibly established another kind of "currency" to replace the position of legal currency. Cities mostly use gold and US dollars, and rural areas mostly use silver dollars and white rice. Currency was originally created to facilitate barter in primitive times, from the initial shells, stones, knives, and silks to gold and silver, and then evolved to today's paper currency. However, in the current stage in China, currency has formed a historical regression!

As China's finances have evolved to the present stage, financial policies must be thoroughly reformed in order to cope with the real environment. Otherwise, the budget proposal for the second half of this year will still only become a formality in practice. This kind of formalism, that is, the budget of deception, will not only not be able to bear the heavy responsibility of suppressing the chaos and building the country, but will also deepen the political and economic crisis. The lessons of the past three years should be deeply recognized by the whole country, and we must never listen to the government's officials who are perfunctory and harm the country and the people.

### Strolling on Mogan Mountain

— Our Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[Quick Dispatch from Our Newspaper Mogan Mountain, 30th] The Presidential Temporary Residence on Mogan Mountain is owned by Chen Yongqing, a director of the Xingye Bank. The house is located at the top of the ridge, with six buildings. The management bureau numbered the addresses as 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, and 556, number 6 is owned by five giants in the maritime banking industry. 551 was built by Xu Jiguan. Because they were like-minded, they built houses on the mountain together and came to the mountain to escape the summer heat together every year. Therefore, it is named Wuyou Village (Five Friends Village). One of the houses is a kitchen and storage room, etc. The other five houses have the same construction style and all have sanitary facilities. There are only two roads leading to this Wuyou Village in the mountains: one is on the left side of the Mogan Mountain Hotel, following the road up, and the other is a small road on the back mountain.

Madame Chiang rarely goes out when residing on the mountain. She has been on the mountain for three days and only strolled on the mountain road with the President on the evening of the 27th. The President wore a gray silk long gown, and Madame wore a Western-style silk casual outfit and a large sun hat. It is said that Madame reads books in the residence and sometimes flips through the residents' roster.

The prices on the mountain are the highest in the hotels. A night costs 8 million yuan, which is only for an ordinary hotel with a single room. High-end hotels cost 20 to 30 million yuan per day. Food is outside, costing about 20 million yuan a day, so a day costs 50 million yuan.

The best scenery on Mogan Mountain is Jianchi (Sword Pond). Jianchi has a waterfall that falls in three levels. A pavilion has been built, and the place where the water flows down is surrounded by a permanent mud fence for bathing. Many foreign women bring bras and wear briefs to bathe here. This place is where the ancient Wu and Yue generals Mo and Xie sharpened their swords. An old man in the mountains told reporters: It was very suitable for the ancients to sharpen their swords here, one because the water was clear, two because the stone quality was good, and three because the mountain produced snakes that leaped like sharp swords unsheathed.

Mogan has Luhua Dang (Reed Flower Pond), which is a mountain spring. The water quality is very good and tastes sweet. Westerners have tested the water and found it to be non-toxic and beneficial, so people from far and near come here to fetch water for drinking without having to re-boil it.

There are the most butterflies on the mountain, with different shapes. In the past, various universities came to this mountain to collect insect specimens. In the summer noon, the sound of cicadas is endless, and there are occasional sounds of "chirping" insects, which are very pleasant.

The mountains are full of secluded valleys. According to the mountain people, bamboo has a pure atmosphere, which can absorb the most carbon dioxide and emit the most oxygen, so it is most suitable for recuperation in the mountains.

### Journey Beyond the Pass (1) Leaving Jiayuguan, the Sand is Boundless

— Our Newspaper Reporter Song Lin

[Air Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Jiuquan, 28th] Leaving Jiayuguan, tears never dry! This is how the ancients described the bleak and resentful mood of traveling to the Western Regions. But at present, due to the development of transportation, this mood has long been diluted by time. The "beyond the pass" mentioned here starts from Jiayuguan, 24 kilometers west of Jiuquan, and includes the Dunhuang Prefecture established in the Han Dynasty, that is, the current Yumen, Anxi, and Dunhuang counties, plus the Mazong Mountain (eastern branch of the Tianshan Mountains, that is, the current Subei Administration Bureau), which guards the three provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang. Its total area is more than 309,700 square kilometers.

Various travelogues provide descriptions of the scenery along the way from Jiuquan to Dunhuang, and the importance of Mazong Mountain in national defense since the "independence" of Outer Mongolia has also gradually become known. However, under the slogan of "equal emphasis on national defense and people's livelihood", what is the current situation of the three counties and one bureau beyond the pass? This is also a matter of concern to the people of the country. This time, after the reporter followed the Lanzhou and other local reporters' tour group to Subei, he specially visited various places to interview the local military and political leaders, public opinion representatives, and the people multiple times. Of course, this kind of cursory interview is not entirely accurate, but due to the limitations of time, transportation, and security, thanks to the sincere words of the local people, and after several times of comparison and comparison, we can get a glimpse of the general situation beyond the pass.

Admiring the Majestic Pass When the reporter arrived in Jiuquan, it was about 5:00 PM on July 9th. In order to go to visit the opening of the new wells of the Yumen Ganqing Oil Mine Factory as soon as possible, the next day we set off for the mine. After the car traveled more than 20 kilometers west, the majestic appearance of Jiayuguan came into view, and the beacon towers and the densely packed telephone poles flew past the car window from time to time. The beacon tower was an effective tool for transmitting military intelligence in ancient times. The telecommunications equipment that echoes it now creates a sense of vicissitudes of time.

Jiayuguan is located at the western foot of Jiayu Mountain between the Qilian Mountains and Yanzhi Mountain. A Mongolian folk song says: "Losing my Qilian Mountains, makes my six livestock not breed; losing my Yanzhi Mountain, makes my women without color!" The soil color of Yanzhi Mountain is very red, really like rouge, which contrasts interestingly with the white snow that never melts on the Qilian Mountains all year round.

Towering City Towers There are different opinions about the construction age of Jiayuguan, but it was definitely not built during the Qin Dynasty. Historical Records: "Qin ordered Meng Tian to lead 300,000 troops to recover the land south of the Yellow River, build the Great Wall, starting from Lintao to Liaodong, extending more than 10,000 li." At that time, Hexi was the territory of the Yuezhi Kingdom, which was originally a Western Rong land. The Qin Dynasty's jurisdiction had not yet reached here, and Lintao during the Qin Dynasty should be in the territory of Minxian County in present-day Gansu. Later, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty opened up the four prefectures of Hexi and ordered Lu Bode to build a border wall to defend against the Xiongnu, starting from the Gaolan Yellow River in the east and reaching Jiayu Mountain in Jiuquan in the west. This was the initial period of Jiayuguan's creation. Subsequently, the boundaries of successive dynasties have repeatedly changed, and the border walls have naturally been repaired and added to. It was not until the fifth year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty that Jiayuguan was completed with repairs and patching. The pass has two layers, inner and outer, all built of huge bricks. The city towers stand tall, towering and majestic. On both sides of the city foot outside the pass, there are stone strike marks for judging the good and bad luck after leaving the pass, called "Knocking the Pass". It is said that if there is an echo when throwing stones, you can survive, otherwise you will be buried in a foreign land. Therefore, although the traces of damage caused by hundreds of years have been repeatedly filled, passers-by are still constantly striking them into powder. The terrain outside the pass is steep, so it is difficult to see its height in the photo. A stone tablet with the inscription "The World's Majestic Pass" stands a bow shot away from the pass, with large characters in the style of a great master, and the three characters "Jiayuguan" written by the President when he visited in the 31st year, which were originally prepared to be inscribed on the top of the pass. After the President returned to Chongqing, he urgently telegraphed here, forbidding the obliteration of the original historical sites. Therefore, these three large characters, one foot square, have been built into a monument and erected at the foot of the Qilian Mountains.

Hangu Pass is a Ball of Mud When Lin Zexu was demoted to Xinjiang and passed through Jiayuguan, he wrote a poem: "The strict pass is hundreds of feet dividing the west of the sky, and the travelers on ten thousand-mile journey stop their horses. The flying pavilion is connected to the straight Qin trees in the distance, and the encircling wall obliquely presses down the clouds of Long. The steep Tianshan Mountains stand shoulder to shoulder, and the vast sea stretches into the misty distance. Who says that Hangu Pass has been a dangerous place for thousands of years, looking back, it is just a ball of mud."

This poem can describe the true situation of that year. When we visited the pass, because the Taoist was not there, we could not buy the key to climb the pass and look into the distance to appreciate the vast and boundless scenery outside the pass. I just felt that this westernmost majestic pass of the Great Wall has lost its national defense value and is only for people to commemorate. New trees have been planted near the pass, reaching 200,000 trees. In the grass without the ankle, there are gurgling springs flowing. One of the oil company's farms is also located here, often planting wheat and vegetables and transporting them to the mine. To the south of the pass is Qishu Mountain, and to the north is Mazong Mountain. The Gansu-Xinjiang Highway lies on the Gobi Desert like a giant python. Looking into the distance, the sand is boundless, and the degree of desolation is even greater than inside the pass. At this time, the wind and clouds changed, and sand and stones flew. Mr. Li Qinghan, the guide, pointed to the oil mine, which was shrouded in a misty rain curtain.

### Household Rice Ration Prices Increased; Rice Market Robust and Prices Soaring

Flour, Grains, Oil, and Cakes All Rise, Moving Towards Peaks Together

Rice prices surge straight up, due to the increase in the household rice ration price to 32,000,000 yuan in August, a rise of 220%, which has strengthened people's resolve. Merchants are taking the opportunity to exert their efforts to push prices up, with increases ranging from 4,000,000 to 6,000,000. Special japonica rice rose to 44,000,000, an increase of 4,500,000. White japonica rice, White Yuan, milled indica rice, and coarse pointed rice each rose by 1,000,000. Thin rice increased by 5,500,000. Early rice, Yin Yuan, coarse japonica rice each rose by 6,000,000. Only new japonica rice rose by 4,000,000. Jiangxi machine-milled late rice rose by 4,500,000. Total arrivals in the city amounted to 3,162 piculs.

Flour continues to advance towards peaks, due to the sharp rise in the rice market and tight money.

### Narrow Range of Fluctuations; Vague Process for Chinese Stocks

Chinese stocks were quite vague yesterday. Off-exchange trading looked stable, with only yarn and cloth slightly rebounding near noon. With both loose and excessive money supply, and the President's arrival in Shanghai, public sentiment increased apprehension. The imminent implementation of the New Economic Policy may bring many favorable factors, leading to a half-day process of ambivalence.

The morning opened cautiously, with Yong Yarn retreating to 12,200 yuan. Numbers 76, 206, 185, 163, 178, 169, 204, and 119 advanced to 12,500 yuan. Numbers 205, 56, 151, 218, 145, 16, 102, and 116 were sold at 12,250 yuan. Off-exchange trading looked brisk, with numbers 154, 135, 131, 98, 69, 104, 216, 45, and 145 being actively bought, rising to a peak of 12,870 yuan. Numbers 154, 169, 65, 116, 71, 89, 85, and 61 were all sold, retreating to 12,480 yuan. Although there was a rebound afterward, it was extremely unstable. Numbers 135, 69, 156, and 117 were closed out, falling to 12,330 yuan. Numbers 56, 163, 197, 226, 224, 143, 131, and 95 were all entered, rising to 12,700 yuan. Numbers 117, 56, 82, 213, 235, 176, and 187 were sold off. Near noon, news of a rebound in yarn and cloth caused a retreat to 12,350 yuan. The noon close was maintained by numbers 205, 55, 197, 169, 98, 119, and 226, rising to 12,600 yuan. Except for Huaxin, which fell to its limit and then rebounded, with a slight decrease of 10%, Xinyi, Yong Yarn, Xinguang, Liana, and Matches were still flat. Datong and Zhabei were down slightly, while Meilin, Tongmeng, Yonggong, and Five and Harmony were up slightly. The rest were down slightly. Among off-exchange unlisted stocks, except for Dasheng and Xinxin showing a trend towards prosperity, the rest saw fluctuating rises and falls.

Government bonds were active yesterday as loose money supply and the New Economic Policy attracted buyers. Tong Bing opened in the morning at 1,140,000, fell to 1,110,000, and rebounded to close at 1,160,000. Rooms 503 and Chengde sold, while rooms 552, 360, and 500 all entered. Compared to the previous close, Jia and Yi rose by 90,000 yuan, Bing rose by 120,000 yuan, Ding rose by 110,000 yuan, and Wu rose by 100,000 yuan, with 2,000,000 traded.

### National Banks' Net Outflow Exceeds 5 Trillion

### Qihong Trend Firm

This year's Qimen black tea, with soaring purchasing costs, has been firmly held by sellers, and the market yesterday showed an increasing reluctance to easily part with it. It is understood that this variety has been sold to Turkey in considerable quantities over the years. According to recent reports, tea is in high demand there, and our authorities have already notified the National Federation of Commerce, reporting prices and quantities, thus frequently leading to higher tea prices here and an increasingly firm stance. As for the Chun Mee and other green teas sold to North Africa, they are also scarce due to hoarding by holders, but exporters are hesitant due to high prices, so the market continues with few transactions, lacking change. As for domestic tea, the street and regional dealers each added to their stocks, and the market atmosphere was as stable as ever.

### Cotton Yarn Market Weak; Prices of Most Grades Fall by About 10%

Yesterday's cotton yarn market, due to consecutive sharp rises and new peaks appearing, inevitably saw a weakness in public sentiment. There were also rumors in the market unfavorable to buying, and spinning companies continued to open five varieties, including 20-count Shuangdiqiu, increasing the supply of chips in the market. Therefore, 42-count Lanfeng fine yarn initially fell slightly by 110 million. Midway, upon hearing of a rise in the stock market, sellers pushed up prices, rebounding to a high of 2.15 billion yuan. Monday's shipments were also high at 2.22 billion.

Subsequently, due to the end of the month, the money supply in the industry tightened, and those urgently needing funds took advantage of the high prices to cash out. Retailers also followed suit and sold off, ultimately closing at 2.005 billion, a decrease of 110 million from the previous day. Monday's shipments were at 2.1 billion, also down 100 million yuan. 21-count Shuangma yarn fell slightly by 130 million due to more sellers than buyers after opening. The overall trend for the day, except for the firm and stable 10-count Delitongzi army and other coarse yarns, saw most other coarse and fine yarns soften by about 10%, with only 54 bales traded.

### Cotton Cloth Firm

Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened in the morning with the news that the authorities were stabilizing the economy and would announce new measures, emphasizing price controls, which caused public sentiment to be weak, with fewer new buyers and more sellers. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth opened at a lower price, but due to compensatory purchases by cloth merchants and retailers, and the rumor that 250,000 customs gold would be officially issued starting next week, the market sentiment suddenly became firm. The market quickly rose sharply to 59.1 million yuan with transactions.

Near the noon close, Fangjian Company suspended the distribution of Longtou fine cloth, and the price gap between the mid-grade Wufu and Laba Tong fine cloths and Longtou was too large, reaching as much as 7 or 8 million, triggering a general buying of Wufu and Laba Tong while selling Longtou. Furthermore, with tight money, retailers cut and sold, and the final Longtou fine cloth still closed slightly lower at 57 million, leveling with the previous day and falling by 2 million compared to the off-exchange price. Laba Tong mid-grade goods saw a slight increase of 500,000 due to more compensatory purchases.

In addition, Yuan Bij from Sijunzi and others rose by another 500,000 due to purchases by Sichuanese dealers. Jinlian Miaowu closed well at 6 million, and other bleached cloth, Shilin cloth, blue cloth, Yuan cloth, and Nafutuo, etc., each rose by another 1 to 1.5 million, with a total of 1,800 pieces traded throughout the day.

Another report: It is said that the filling price of the Longtou fine cloth distributed by Fangjian Company was 57.8 million yuan, and it is understood that each household is only allowed to purchase one piece, causing public sentiment to become firm. Finally, bids were made with an added price of 2 to 3 million, and transactions were not bad, similar to Sijunzi Bij.

Another report: China Textile yesterday followed the usual practice of selling more than ten types of cotton yarn, approving 462 purchase orders, selling 20,990 pieces of cotton cloth and 130 quilts. Also, Fangjian Company yesterday sold three types of yarn in the cotton yarn market on behalf of the Yarn Control Board, totaling 954 bales, with a value of 78.99 million yuan.

### Unified Purchase of Cotton Certificates to Be Abolished from Today

[Our report] The Yarn Control Board has decided that the cotton purchase certificates and transportation certificates for unified purchase of cotton, as well as the Shanghai cotton movement certificates, will be abolished from today (August 1st), and has announced this to the entire country, it is said.

### U.S. Cotton Exchange Yarn Ratio Not Yet Specifically Calculated

The private factories in this city are concerned that the reported U.S. aid cotton exchange yarn ratio advocates exchanging one bale of yarn (including labor costs) for 577 pounds of cotton, and they have inquired with the Sixth District Association to ascertain its accuracy. According to the person in charge of the association, the yarn-for-cotton ratio should be calculated based on the international market price of exported yarn and cloth compared to the foreign cotton price (including freight, tariffs, and other expenses). The technical team has not specifically calculated how many pounds of cotton can actually be exchanged.

### Rayon Allocation Price Determined

[Our report] The China Trust Bureau's rayon meeting yesterday decided that the brand price of rayon for the first week of August 2nd to 7th would be 16,980,000 yuan per box for Italian rayon.

### Market Conditions in Various Regions

Wuxi: [Our Wuxi, 31st dispatch] The trend of various commodities is firm, continuing to rise. Shanghai dealers are approaching the fourth barrier. White japonica opened at 39.24 million, Baiyuan at 37.54 million, Yangxian at 39.74 million, japonica rice at 16.72 million, wheat at 27.5 million, white wheat at 30.3 million, flour at 12.23 million, soybean oil at 86.9 million, and cotton yarn at 148 million. In addition, the county government recently cracked down on a large-scale underground money house inside the Jinfeng Socks Factory on Zhongshan Road, and two important officials have been interrogated and detained.

Bengbu: [Our Bengbu, 31st dispatch] The grain market is still fluctuating. Wheat has risen to 42 million, soybeans are high at 54 million, long rice has fallen to 42 million, and edible oil has soared.

### Silver and Money Industry to Discuss Improvement of Collection and Settlement Methods with Various Industries

Various industries can only settle their bills with the silver and money industry in the morning, so those who hold bank and money house cashier's checks cannot be included in the exchange after noon and must wait until the next day. For firms short on cash, even if they have funds, they cannot exchange and offset them, and they must separately collect cash to compensate, which is very difficult. The transfer application form, which various industries used to allocate funds in the afternoon, has been ordered to be prohibited, stating that this application form is limited to the silver and money industry for its own use and cannot be issued to meet the needs of customers. For more than a month, various industries have felt excessively restricted in their capital turnover and believe that the silver and money industry must find a way to remedy this. The Cotton Cloth Dyeing and Weaving Associations therefore presented reasons and listed remedial measures a few days ago: (1) Extend the bill collection time by two hours, (2) Increase the number of cashier's check exchanges, (3) Open up transfer application forms. They jointly requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to negotiate with the Banking Association and the Money Industry Association, with more than 70 industry associations from commerce and industry co-signing. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has received replies from the two silver and money industry associations and has scheduled to invite various industries to discuss the measures at the Chamber of Commerce at 4:00 PM on August 2nd. The silver and money industry has indicated to the Chamber of Commerce that the restriction on transfer application forms has in fact been slightly relaxed. As for the extension of bill collection and the increase in the number of cashier's check exchanges, it is due to limitations of manpower and expenses, and not a lack of understanding of the difficulties faced by various industries, it is said.

### Lou Wenao Ranks 17th in 10,000-Meter Race; Circled Among Top Five at 2,000 Meters; Crowd Cheers After Completing Full Distance

[Central News Agency, London, 30th dispatch] (Delayed) Our country's athlete Lou Wenao, who participated in the World Games 10,000-meter race, failed today afternoon when past long-distance masters of the World Games met at Wembley Stadium. There were 30 starters, and Lou Wenao ranked 17th, but he was the last person to run the full distance and cross the finish line. The other 13 people, including Finnish world 10,000-meter record holder Heino, all dropped out halfway shortly after the start. After running 2,000 meters, Lou Wenao was in the top five and maintained that position for 500 meters, but ultimately could not compete with the leading runners' amazing strides. At 7,000 meters, Lou Wenao was more than 400 meters behind the Czech Zatopek, who showed no signs of fatigue. When Lou completed the full distance, a group of ecstatic spectators gave him a warm cheer. Zatopek also set a new World Games record this time - 29 minutes 59.6 seconds. World 10,000-meter record holder Heino (29 minutes 35.4 seconds) followed behind, but was exhausted and withdrew 3,200 meters from the finish line, staggering like a drunk.

### Zatopek Wins 10,000-Meter Championship

[Our report] London, 30th broadcast: Czech youth officer Zatopek ran 10,000 meters in 29 minutes 59.6 seconds, breaking the Olympic record of 30 minutes 11.4 seconds set by Poland's Ruszowski in Los Angeles in 1932, amidst the ecstatic cheers of 70,000 spectators. Zatopek's steady pace and determined attitude caused world record holder Heino to retreat, abandoning the race halfway.

London was overcast today, and the scorching sun had retreated. The oppressive heat wave of the past few days has subsided. A total of 27 athletes participated. At the sound of the starting gun, Finland's Heino took the lead, followed by Sweden's Arbison and Finland's Lem Jon. In the third lap, Heino and Arbison were still leading, and Hysekum (Finland) and Kodjia (France) surpassed Lem Jon one after another, following behind. Zatopek was mixed in with the ten or so people at the rear, not showing his strength. In the seventh lap, this unassuming Czech youth gradually emerged, and the leading Nordic generals began to feel the threat. In the ninth lap, Zatopek suddenly flew past like a meteor, overtaking Storken (Norway), Kodjia, Arbison, Hysek Ma, and Heino one after another, and from then on, he sped away, straight to the finish line. Heino, after being overtaken by 30 meters, knew that he could no longer compete and dropped out halfway. Zatopek, also due to a lack of competition, failed to break Heino's world record of 29 minutes 35.4 seconds set in 1937. Zatopek was about 300 meters ahead of second-place Kodjia when he reached the finish line. Sweden's Arbison and Danov won third and fourth place, Norway's Storken fifth, and Belgium's Eferle sixth.

American athlete Bennett threw 167 feet 8 and 1/4 inches on his first attempt. The weather suddenly cooled down, making athletes and spectators feel much more comfortable.

As the Stars and Stripes were raised on the champion's flagpole, the unofficial national team scores had the United States jumping to 19 points.

### Our Basketball Team's Unfavorable Start - First Battle Lost to Chile - Difference of Five Points - Many Missed Free Throws Waste Good Opportunities

[Our Own Report] London, July 31st broadcast: The Chinese basketball team had an unfavorable start today, losing its first battle to Chile by a difference of five points. The process was extremely tense. In the first half, it was 19 to 18, with Chile winning by only one point. The situation in the second half was even more intense. The Chilean team's actions were excessive, and China had many opportunities for free throws, but due to excessive psychological tension, they missed many, thus wasting good opportunities. The audience regretted this. Among them, Bao Songyuan missed six free throws, Cai Zhongqiang missed three, Wu Chengzhang missed two, and Yu Ruizhang also missed three. If half of these 14 shots had been made, the Chinese team could have won. In this game, Cai Wenhua and Wu Chengzhang were the most outstanding. Cai scored a total of 15 points, and Wu also scored 9 points. The other players were abnormal. This World Games basketball tournament is using a round-robin system. If the Chinese team wins in the next few games, there is still hope to be among the top teams.

Reasons for Failure

[Central News Agency, London, July 31st] Our basketball team lost to the Chilean team in the first game by a score of 44 to 39 after a hard battle. Our team was not at its best in tonight's 40-minute game. The game showed that the team lacked significant point scorers. Only Cai Wenhua's long shots and Bao Songyuan's quick rushes and one-handed shots scored more points. The first 20 minutes of the first half were a back-and-forth struggle. Neither side was able to gain a complete advantage. Our team missed many good free throw opportunities, and the team's luck was extremely poor, as the team members failed to score on many shots that they were very confident in making. Huang Tianxi, our team's 6-foot-3-inch guard, was ejected after committing four fouls, which greatly weakened the team's defense. The result of the first half was 18 to 19, with Chile in the lead. At the beginning of the second half, Chile immediately increased its score by six points, taking the lead for the first time. Cai Wenhua, the captain of our team, made two consecutive baskets in the middle of the field, making the team active again. Other points were scored by Bao Songyuan and Wu Chengzhang from free throws. Bao Songyuan was also ejected later due to committing four fouls. The main reasons for the team's failure were: (1) failure to score on free throws, (2) lack of shooters, and (3) weakened defense after two formal guards were ejected. Also, our team's second game is against the Belgian team.

### Li Shiqiao Did Not Arrive - Emotional Panic

[Our Own Report] London, July 31st broadcast: The Chinese basketball team's loss to Chile was mainly due to the fact that Li Shiqiao, the key to the forward score, failed to arrive. The guards being too quick to move far out, allowing the ball to fall into the hands of the enemy, and then being unable to return to rescue it, was also a reason for the setback. The strength of the two teams was about the same, so the battle was extremely tense. In the last few minutes of the game, the difference was still between half a point and one point. The Chinese team was eager to win, but missed several free throws, so Chile scored two consecutive goals, making it impossible to recover. The Chinese lineup at the beginning of the game was: Yu Ruizhang, Wu Chengzhang, Cai Wenhua, Bao Songyuan, Huang Tianxi.

### School Introduction - Nanjing Jianguo College

Nanjing Jianguo College of Law and Commerce was founded in the spring of the 36th year of the Republic by Zhang Ji, Chen Guofu, Xiao Zheng, Zhou Binglin, Zhao Jinhua and others. Currently, the college has six departments, including Law, Politics, Economics, Cooperation, Business Management, Accounting and Banking, and a Land Administration Research Institute. It also plans to add a College of Arts and Sciences and then change its name to "Jianguo University." The professors hired by the college are all experienced and reputable authoritative scholars in the country. President Xiao Zheng is an authority in the field of land administration in our country. He once served as a professor at National Chengchi University. Over the past 20 years, he has cultivated countless "land administration specialists," but he is still "not satisfied." Therefore, he contacted comrades and founded the college. Yang Youjiong, the director of academic affairs, is a jurist and famous professor who is not only famous in China, but also enjoys a high reputation around the world, and is recognized as one of the fourteen famous jurists in the world. Lin Bin, the director of the Department of Law, has served as a legislator in various sessions and participated in drafting hundreds of laws, such as the Constitution, Civil Law, and Criminal Law. He has successively taught at Peking University, National Central University, National Chengchi University, and Chaoyang University. He has now been nominated by the President to serve as a Justice of the Constitutional Court of the first session. Lou Tongsun, the director of the Department of Economics, has served as a professor at National Central University, the president of Zhejiang College of Law and Politics, a legislator, and the secretary-general of the Legislative Yuan. He is one of the leading economists in our country. Shou Miancheng, the director of the Department of Cooperation, is the leader of the cooperative sector in China today and currently serves as the general manager of the Central Cooperative Bank. Wu Chengluo, the director of the Department of Business Management, is a famous industrial scientist in the country. He has served as the director of the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Economy and the director of the Trademark Bureau, and is currently a technical supervisor of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Pan Xulun, the director of the Department of Accounting and Banking, is the most famous accounting expert in our country. In addition, most of the professors at the college are famous scholars and celebrities in the country, or even the world, such as Hu Ciwei, Dai Xiuzan, Mei Zhongxie, Xiao Gongzhao, Guan Jiyu, Zhang Pijie, Wu Shuting, Shen Shidi, Liu Keru, Du Guangxun, Dai Mingli, Gu Yuqiong, Ren Zhuoxuan (Ye Qing), etc.

At present, the college has nearly 1,000 teachers and students. This summer, it is recruiting 50 new freshmen in each department in Beijing and Shanghai, a total of 300 people, and a number of second-year transfer students. The recruitment is being held in both Beijing and Shanghai. The Shanghai area has been scheduled to register from July 29 to August 10, and the exams will be held on August 14 and 15. The registration location has been moved to No. 553 Linsen Middle Road (across from the Paris Grand Theatre) starting today, and the exam location is the same.

### The So-Called "Science"

— Ji Yong

Yang Mei's "mystery" has been unraveled. Our country's scientists have researched for so many days, spent so much money, and finally proved a truth:

"You can't live without eating; it's impossible to not eat for nine years!"

I dare not say whether this conclusion is ironic or not, but I only feel that Chinese scientists are so lacking in confidence! The world has already reached the 1950s, and they still want to attach scientific basis to the allusions in the Five Elements Records. Is this the achievement of our fifty years of science? I really feel embarrassed for Mr. Science.

Science has its own scientific truth, and it does not allow any accidental matters to distort it, otherwise what kind of truth is it? The human body needs nutrition, and nutrition must be absorbed from food. Even plants and trees are no exception. This is common sense and cannot be considered a scientific invention or discovery. Our ancestors have said many times: "One day without food, you will be hungry; three days without food, you will be sick; seven days without food, you will die." Except for certain political hunger strikes, which can have the "miracle" of not eating for more than twenty days, there are very few exceptions. However, our scientists do not even have this basic belief, isn't it strange?

Reading Western history, there are stories of Copernicus and Galileo sacrificing their lives and freedom for the truth. Chinese people may think it's too foolish. As for Darwin, who dared to defy the world, even in the 1930s in the United States, there were lawsuits arising from the theory of evolution. The religious persecution Darwin suffered at that time is probably beyond our imagination. The reason they were so firm and not moved by the fallacies of the world was nothing more than their strong faith and recognition of the truth. Its essence is no different from the martyrdom spirit of religious figures. It's a pity that no one has written a book to depict the philosophers who sacrificed for the belief in truth, so that we can have more courage. However, even watching a movie like "Madame Curie" is enough to inspire a coward, isn't it?

China is a country where science is not developed. Although some national essence scholars loudly sing about how Mozi invented airplanes and the Book of Songs contains strange theories about the eight planets, and that the origins of all the world's scientific principles can be found in China, the facts are too far from it and can only serve as a Quixotic spiritual sustenance for a declining nation. However, our wise predecessors often gave us encouragement for the courage to recognize the truth. Mencius said: "If you reflect on yourself and find you are right, go forward even if there are thousands of people against you." He also said: "Wealth and rank cannot corrupt me, poverty and meanness cannot move me, and power and force cannot subdue me." These are all excellent teachings. It's just that we emphasize ethical codes, while the West emphasizes natural laws, and thus developed into two paradigms of philosophy and science.

Some people say that because there is no scientific system, philosophy is also fragmented and cannot form a system like Aristotle and Kant. This is also true. The main reason is that we pay too much attention to daily life and are not willing to engage in abstract thinking. This is also caused by climate, geography, and economic conditions, which cannot be helped. Confucius's "one thread of loyalty and forbearance" was interpreted by Mr. Zhang Taiyan as a learning method. Loyalty is being loyal to truth and knowledge, and forbearance is reasoning from the truth, so-called inferring three corners from one corner, like definitions and theorems in today's physics and geometry. Perhaps this is somewhat biased, but looking at the scholarly spirit of the Han scholars of the Qing Dynasty, we feel it is correct.

The polytheism and witchcraft of barbarian peoples are also called shamanism. Today, the indigenous people of Siberia and some ethnic minorities in the northeastern border regions of China still retain this custom, and it has even spread to the Yellow River basin. People dance with spirits, snakes, foxes, and rats are all objects of worship, and small temples of the "Great Immortal" are everywhere. Corresponding to this is divination, which is believed by more intellectuals. Although science has progressed, there are magnificent hospitals in big cities, and several departments of natural science and applied science have been established in universities, wandering doctors and shamans still dominate the folk. Big cities are also full of things like scientific fortune-telling, which is simply our shame. The initial motive of things like Yang Mei's matter is probably not different from the spirit dancing of female shamans. Unexpectedly, due to the belief of the ignorant people, it attracted the attention of the scientific community and spent a lot of money and time researching a phenomenon that is absolutely incompatible with science. At least I think this is a waste! Now that a flaw has finally been found, proving that people cannot survive without eating, if this flaw were never discovered, would the scientific community really be prepared to admit the principle that "you can still live without eating"? Science proves unscientific rumors, and shamanism has a basis for everything. I dare not imagine what attitude the public will take towards Mr. Science!

Not only does the material construction of science need to be worked on, but the spiritual construction of science also needs to be worked on! Please don't let the smog blind your eyes again, and you will be fortunate!

### Foreign Unicorns

— Nan Wu

In Europe in the sixteenth century, the practice of poisoning enemies was very popular. For a time, wealthy families all rushed to buy unicorn horn cups, because they believed that unicorn horns had the effect of detoxification. But unicorns were originally just legendary things, so what they bought were actually cups made of ivory. In 1553, King Henry II of France paid a huge price for a unicorn horn cup, which would be worth as much as 100,000 US dollars today. According to Western legends, unicorns are shaped like horses, with heads like goats, with hooves, and a horn that extends diagonally forward from the forehead. This horn is extremely long, reaching four or five feet. Also, unicorns in murals from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries are mostly white, looking very docile, but there are also pictures of them stabbing people with that long horn.

### Chen Shaobai's Literary Works

— Lu Danlin

Revolutionary veteran Chen Shaobai studied for the imperial examinations in his hometown in his youth. He was intelligent and capable of writing (see Zhong Rongguang's "Biography of Mr. Chen Shaobai"). He was handsome, quick-witted, and proficient in poetry, lyrics, songs, fu, qin, chess, calligraphy, and painting. He was known as a romantic talent. In the early days of the Xingzhonghui, there was a lack of writers, and most of the proclamations were written by Shaobai (see Feng Ziyou's "Chen Shaobai's Literary Works"). Chen's management of the China Daily was incisive and unique for a time. Nine years before the Republic of China, the Protect the Emperor Party published the Commercial Daily in Hong Kong, with Xu Qin, a student of Kang Youwei, as the president. Chen and Xu engaged in a war of words in more than ten continued drafts, marking the beginning of political debates in the mainland.

Tao Mo, the Governor-General of Liangguang, admired the new learning and read the China Daily every day. He often used the comments in the China Daily as a standard for promoting and demoting officials. At the end of the Guangxu reign, Cen Chunxuan, the Governor-General of Liangguang, announced that the Yuehan Railway would be taken over by the government. The shareholders of the Yue Railway unanimously resisted. Cen arrested the gentry, including Wang Guolian, and started the railway administration turmoil. Shareholders in Hong Kong organized the "Yue Railway Shareholders' Association for the Protection of Railway Rights" to resist the Qing government. The texts and all plans issued by this association were presided over by Chen. The gentlemen of Hong Kong usually admired Chen's profound and fluent articles, so they specially hired him as a consultant.

In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the Founding Father was enshrined in Nanjing, and he went to Nanjing to participate. He lived in the Dongya Hotel in Shanghai beforehand, and we often had the opportunity to chat. One day, he showed me the elegiac couplet he had written for the Founding Father. The couplet said: "One failure is it indeed! To practice the Way for a hundred years, abandoning the small for the large, striving for Great Harmony, even in hardship, even in dying, never slacking off. His influence is now gone! Entering the world for thirty years, driving the heroes, attracting many talents, who can be called a true confidant, a true comrade?" The inscription on the upper part was "Eternal Remembrance to Brother Yixian," and the inscription on the lower part was "Chen Shaobai Pays Respects." Chen and the Founding Father were classmates at the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese, and the two had sworn brotherhood. Among the Founding Father's comrades, only Chen was called brother, so Chen also directly called the Founding Father brother. (In fact, the Founding Father was three years older than Chen.)

Chen admired his fellow villager, Chen Baisha (Xianzhang), so he changed his name to Bai, with the style name Shaobai (his original name was Wen Shao, with the pseudonym Qiu Shi). He once wrote a couplet for the South Gate of his hometown, Xinhui: "The unparalleled scholar of Lingnan Neo-Confucianism, the first city of mountains and rivers within the territory." This can also be seen as his ambition to emulate the virtues of his predecessors. The essay is too long to excerpt. Now I excerpt a few of his poems to illustrate the rest. Visiting Su Zheng in Xianyang: "Living in Huaqing for just three springs, endless beauty to explore at will. If you want to know where the hero sleeps, north of Mount Li and south of the Wei River." "A solitary tomb of hundreds of feet is built of earth, the six kings are scattered and the strife is over. Now that there are no gateways in the southeast, one should remember the ten thousand li city for planning the borders." A poem for the pipa presented to the oriental hero Miyazaki Torazo: "A woman adrift in Xunyang, her icy strings tell of parting. A beggar from Wu, also makes the sound of the Dongxiao flute. Heroes wander and beauties grow old, sharing the remaining feelings and entrusting them to the autumn grass. I give you the pipa to accompany you on your travels, plucking for ten years in a long, desolate state." Feeling from a visit to Zhangjiakou: "The Great Wall has no end, rising from the ground and towering into the sky, it is difficult to scale. The wind and sand outside the fortress make the sky seem to change, and the autumn rain makes dreams cold. The market in the sun is not for the Hu horses, and the people I meet in my travels are all wearing Han crowns. The two forts have been at peace for three hundred years, just teach them to protect each other and not kill each other."

### Hungarian Anecdotes

— Jinjin

Hungary is an ancient country in Central Europe, and it still retains many customs of the past. For example, when an unmarried girl carries a bucket of breakfast to a farmer working in the field, she also gives him a pot of flowers and fruits. If he is happy to accept it and returns a bag of sugar to her, it is considered a formal engagement. Nine out of ten Hungarian women are named Ilona. They can enjoy voting rights in politics, but only if they are over thirty years old, have at least three daughters, have received a university education, have the ability to make a living, or are married to husbands who have received a high school education.

Hungarians love to eat paprika and must have it with every meal. Farmers carry a large amount of powder in their wallets. When they eat corn, they eat the husks and tassels together, which Europeans often laugh at. Lake Balaton in the country is the largest freshwater lake in Central Europe, and it is famous for its unique species of blue-tailed fish, which are made into delicious fish soups.

The capital of Hungary is Budapest, which is actually a combination of Buda and Pest. It is divided into two districts by the Danube River, with bridges connecting them. Buda is older, while Pest is more modern. It is a popular place for boating and sailing, and water races are also very famous.

The Hungarian race is very complex, including Magyars, Germans, Jews, Serbs, Bosnians, Slovaks, etc. Among them, the Magyars are the most powerful, accounting for 93% of the total population, and they often discriminate against other races.

### Ascent

— Gongsun Wu

Built with earth and stone, with pavilions and towers on top, to enjoy the pleasure of distant views. Yuan Jie's "Preface to the Terrace Inscription" says, "In ancient times, there were those who harbored anger and were sick of the customs of the time. Unable to build high terraces to look around, they would climb to the peaks of mountains and the shores of the sea, stretching their necks and singing to express themselves." This so-called terrace is actually a steep stone, eighty or ninety feet high. The inscription says, "The Xiang River is clear and deep, the terrace is steep and precipitous. Climbing and looking far, nothing is out of sight. Who is tired of the hustle and bustle of the city, trapped in a narrow space? Lend me this terrace, to indulge my mind and eyes." Reading this, I realize the wonderful use of ascending and looking afar. Mingling in the streets, one forgets one's cramped situation for a long time. Today there are skyscrapers, whose tops can be climbed, and people below look like insects. However, foreigners commit suicide by jumping from them. If these people could taste Yuan Jie's words, to express themselves, why couldn't they change their thoughts of厭世 with a long-term perspective? Some say that those who climb high look up at the sky and look down at the dust and filth, which will only increase their anger and disgust. This is indeed the case, but only for those who have not seen the Way. If one cherishes the solemnity of hell, and would give one's brain marrow, then one would wish to transform into billions of bodies, to be a marshal and a torch, to bear the heavy burden of the masses, why would one need to climb to express oneself?

### Huang Binhong's Couplet for Gao Chuiwan

Mr. Huang Binhong, the libationer of the National Academy of Painting, is eighty-five years old. He has been living in Beiping in recent years, and in addition to painting and calligraphy, he has been writing constantly. Recently, he flew from Beiping to Shanghai. The calligraphers of Shanghai held a gathering at the Daguan Society to welcome him, which was extremely grand. The following is a congratulatory couplet written by the elderly Bin for Mr. Gao Chuiwan of Jinshan on his 70th birthday last year.

The farce of Shanghai demolishing stone figures and the mob of ignorant people rioting can be described as in full swing. Looking at the state of the stone figures being pulled and lifted in the copperplate print, their embarrassment and ridiculousness are more than the soap king in the play "Splitting the Soap Family." There are many stone figures in the old capital, and the atmosphere is slower to open up than in Jiangnan, but I have never seen such a bustling scene.

The stone figures in the suburbs of the old capital are due to the tombs of princes, nobles, and high-ranking ministers, which are allowed to be erected, with the amount depending on the rank and status. (Commonly called stone men and stone horses. Stone men include both civil and military officials. Stone horses include various types of horses.) The stone men often have incomplete parts, or half a body, or just a head, and are used for appreciating antiques along with wooden and clay figures. Stone horses, stone unicorns, lions, and elephants are mostly small, displayed on the side steps of shop doors. Because they are heavy, there is no fear of theft, and they are also advertisements for unique products. Passersby who stop to admire them will have a widespread impression of the antiques and antiques inside the shop. They are especially attractive to foreigners. In the past, "foreign shops" had very good sales. However, since the Republic of China, the Manchu nobles have become increasingly impoverished. These items have no practical use, and there are many sellers. However, genuine items are mostly large, and it is not easy to move and sell them. Small items are also rare, but they can be imitated. Some who are good at making foreign money order stone masons to imitate their shape and reduce their volume, like models.

In the past, there were many foreigners in Dongjiaomin Lane, and foreign shops flourished. At that time, foreigners liked to collect Buddhist statues, deity statues, and Dharma instruments and utensils. The old capital was originally the capital of the Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties, and the number of temples was more than the "four hundred and eighty temples of the Southern Dynasties." There were more than 370 named ones inside and outside the nine cities, and the small nunneries and temples in the streets and alleys were countless. Due to the changes of the times, incense was sparse. Except for the particularly famous large temples, most of the idols and offerings in them were colluded by the abbots and merchants, and transferred to foreigners through antique dealers. The houses of small temples were rented out to civilians and became courtyards. Only two or three out of ten of the halls remained, barely maintaining the facade, and the rest disappeared. The idols and Buddhist instruments of the small temples were convenient to display and transport, and their craftsmanship was extremely exquisite (because the small size made it easier to construct), and they were truly the highest art. Chinese people, except for those who believed in them and took them home for worship, were afraid of desecration and were unwilling to buy them easily. Foreigners collected everything. Therefore, in the backyards of various antique shops, large and small god and Buddha statues and utensils of all kinds were prepared, as if one were in an ancient temple. This was the situation before the twentieth year of the Republic of China. In the past ten years, there have been fewer foreigners, the "foreign shops" have "withered," and the inventory of temples has become increasingly scarce. Seven or eight out of ten antique dealers have closed down, and everything has become a fleeting cloud. The other day, I visited a temple fair and saw an old monk setting up a stall, dumping his old cassock, and incomplete scriptures, wooden fish, rosary beads, etc., to earn money for his meals. This reflects the increasingly difficult life in general, especially for temples. Nowadays, bereaved families rarely have the money to do Buddhist services, and monks rely on "socializing" (i.e., chanting sutras) as a major source of income, and new-style economic funerals are popular, so few people inquire about Buddhist services. Recalling the old Qing Dynasty, "monks in the capital, officials outside," it seems like a different world. In the past, officials in Beijing were mostly poor and had no retinues, while officials outside the capital are now mostly respected and wealthy. However, the monks of the major temples in Beijing have a lot of interactions with the nobles, dignitaries, celebrities, and gentry of the inner court, banquets, and socializing, and have a great deal of activity. The temple properties and income are abundant and prosperous, and ordinary Buddhist services have become secondary. Therefore, people at that time thought that it was better to be an official outside the capital and a monk in the capital.

During the period of the occupation, the Japanese army searched and hoarded supplies for their military needs. Rice, in particular, almost became the exclusive property of the Japanese and a small number of senior puppet officials. The prices of other grains were high and scarce. There were many monks in the major temples, and it was truly a case of "too many monks and not enough porridge." The supply was not sustained. Therefore, a famous temple in the western city carried out a large "begging for alms" parade. The streets were filled with teams of monks, which the Chinese people were surprised to see, as they had never seen this before. However, in India and other places, this is a common occurrence. The so-called "begging for alms from door to door," with each household respectfully offering rice porridge. China is not a purely Buddhist country, so although they "beg for alms," it is not convenient to go "from door to door." It is only a sign of famine.
