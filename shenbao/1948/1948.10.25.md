### Victory on Both Sides of Southern and Western Liaoning: Yingkou and Heishan Recovered Simultaneously; Final Battle Deployment Completed in the Jinzhou-Huludao Area

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 24th] The Li Yuzhang Corps of the Southern Liaoning Assault Force, after capturing Haicheng on the 23rd, recaptured Dashiqiao and Yingkou Port within 24 hours on the 24th, opening up the Shenyang-Yingkou railway. The reopening of the port has significant implications. The Liu Corps marched in under the cover of night on the 23rd, and at 6:00 AM on the 24th, they first seized Dashiqiao, the connection point between Yingkou and Dalian. The search troops then advanced towards Yingkou. After a fierce battle, Yingkou was declared recovered at 9:00 AM. Yingkou fell on February 26th of this year when Wang Jiashan, the commander of the newly formed defending troops, surrendered to the bandits. The city was under bandit control for eight months less two days. The bandit's Third Independent Division and the Fifth Military Sub-district, totaling about three regiments, along with the Yangtze River troops and the Gaiping Security Regiment, numbered about five to six thousand men. After four or five attacks by the Liu Corps, they suffered heavy losses, and the remnants fled towards Niuzhuang and areas east of Anshan. After the complete defeat of the bandits in Southern Liaoning, the damage to the China Changchun Railway and the section between Dashiqiao and Yingkou was not severe. The China Changchun Railway authorities are expected to be able to quickly repair it. The port of Yingkou has about one and a half months left in the shipping season. If the opportunity can be seized, there is much that can be accomplished. At dawn on the 24th, two naval vessels arrived off the coast of Yingkou to support the attacking forces. After the bandits retreated, troops landed. More ships are expected to arrive, which will greatly contribute to the next major battle in Western Liaoning.

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 24th] The Shenyang Western Advancement Corps arrayed outside Heishan and Dahu Mountain. The bandits in Dahu Mountain, Hanbangzi, Luyangyi, and Beizhen mostly fled westward. The National Army entered Heishan city on the morning of the 24th. Other units are attempting to capture the main force of the bandits. A major battle is brewing in the Jinzhou-Huludao area. Both sides have completed their deployments, and a battle is imminent. The bandits are using a portion of their forces to move towards Suizhong, possibly attempting to control the transportation inside and outside the Shanhaiguan Pass and to block the National Army from entering Manchuria. The National Army has deployed in a pincer formation for the decisive battle between Jinzhou and Huludao, and the bandits will be attacked from both sides. The recovery of Yingkou further strengthens this force, which shows the government's determination towards the Northeast. Currently, warships and transport ships are continuously moving on the Liaodong Bay.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 24th] Our Southern Liaoning Corps captured Dashiqiao at 6:00 AM on the 24th and then recaptured Yingkou, the maritime gateway to the Northeast, at 9:00 AM. The good news has greatly excited the million residents here. The Liaoning Provincial Government has announced Liao Chuangui as the Mayor of Yingkou. Liao has already entered the urban area with the troops on the morning of the 24th and is carrying out relief work for the returning refugees.

Military authorities have stated that if the Nie bandits linger in the Sui-Baotou area and do not retreat, it will provide an opportunity for the National Army to fight an annihilation battle. The speaker pointed out that the Communist bandits are far from their base areas, and the Sui-Baotou area is a simple plain with very few villages and trees, making it extremely unfavorable for the Communist bandits to fight.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 24th] Regarding the withdrawal from Baotou, it is learned here that the garrison troops in Baotou also safely withdrew to the mountainous area 30 to 40 li northwest, waiting for an opportunity to fight the bandits.

It is reported that the order to withdraw from Baotou was issued by a certain place at 4:00 AM on the 23rd. The headquarters and troops began to withdraw at dawn, and merchants also left Baotou with the army. The forces attacking Baotou were the bandit's 1st and 8th Columns, with a cavalry unit, totaling over 20,000 men. After capturing Tuoxian County, they moved upstream along the Yellow River and briefly engaged with the National Army militia near Dengkou. The highest military authorities in North China made the decision to withdraw due to the small number of garrison troops in Baotou.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 24th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters announced: A major battle outside Guisui has not yet occurred. The bandits who fled to Taohua Slope south of Guisui and the Zhao Jun Tomb seem to be constructing fortifications.

### President Hosts Banquet for Presidents and Professors of Various Colleges and Universities in Beiping, Soliciting Opinions on the Economy; Weng Wenhao May Fly Back to Nanjing Today

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 24th] President Chiang hosted a banquet for President Weng Wenhao, Vice President Zhang Lisheng, and presidents and professors of various colleges and universities in Beiping, including Hu Shi, Chen Yuan, Mei Yiqi, Lu Zhiwei, Yuan Dunli, Zhao Naibo, Jiang Shuojie, Zhou Zuoren, Chen Daisun, Wu Jingchao, Liu Dazhong, Dai Siguang, Zhao Shouyu, He Lin, and Zhu Guangwei, at his residence at 8:00 PM on the 24th.

The professors and experts actively spoke and expressed their opinions. They focused on discussing the following issues: (1) banks stopping loans, (2) freezing deposits, (3) stopping the clearing of bills, believing that in the current situation, it is necessary to tighten credit funds in order to determine effective measures to stabilize the currency system and prices. Although the symposium broadly exchanged views on various issues, no specific decisions were made.

According to authoritative sources, the current price problem is hovering on the edge of price limits and negotiated prices. If the price limits are lifted for a part of the goods, then the prices of all goods will be affected. Only the allocation of essential consumer goods can stabilize general prices.

At 8:00 PM, the President hosted a banquet for celebrities and scholars in the education field at his official residence to listen to their opinions. Those invited to participate included university presidents Lu Zhiwei, Chen Yuanchun, Yuan Dunli, and Mei Yiqi, as well as several professors who participated in Premier Weng's symposium in the afternoon.

### Vice President Li Presides over the United Nations Day Celebration; Reads the President's Message, Reaffirming Confidence and Enthusiasm

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Presidential Palace solemnly commemorated "United Nations Day" on the morning of the 24th. President Chiang issued a message, reaffirming his confidence in the United Nations organization and reiterating his enthusiasm for international peace and cooperation. This message was read by Vice President Li on his behalf at the commemorative meeting. On the 24th, the United Nations flag was hung high at the entrance of the Presidential Palace, with colorful colors fluttering in the wind. At 10:00 AM, the commemorative ceremony began. Vice President Li presided over the meeting. Zhonggui civil and military officials Yu Youren, Jia Jingde, Liu Zhe, Wu Dingchang, etc. all attended the grand ceremony. After Vice President Li led the ceremony, he read the President's message on the spot, and then the ceremony was completed. The original text of the President's message is as follows:

The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution at its second regular session, declaring October 24th as "United Nations Day." People of all countries in the world will reaffirm their confidence in the United Nations organization on this day every year and reiterate their enthusiasm for international peace and cooperation.

The designation of October 24th as "United Nations Day" has a profound significance. Three years ago on this day, the Charter of the United Nations came into effect, giving infinite hope to the people of the world. From this day on, the greatest organization in history to promote peace, the United Nations organization, began its mission, in accordance with the principles established in the Charter, to achieve the purposes it proclaimed. All peace-loving people share a determination to seek its success.

In the past three years, the United Nations organization and its member states have made significant achievements in achieving the purposes of the United Nations organization. Countries have submitted various international disputes to the United Nations organization for peaceful resolution and have promoted international cooperation in economic and social aspects. In addition, measures have been properly formulated for the development of underdeveloped areas of the world in order to promote the well-being of the local people. In short, its scope of activities extends to all parts of the world and is closely related to human life.

However, the purposes and principles of the United Nations have not been fully realized. The success of the United Nations organization still depends on the joint efforts of the people of all countries. The Chinese people are peaceful by nature, and not long ago, they suffered from the scourge of aggression. They have long vowed to assist the achievement of the goals of the United Nations organization with their power. This effort will not be relaxed.

On this "United Nations Day," the Chinese people reiterate their confidence and enthusiasm.

### Price Increases for State-Owned Public Utilities and Transportation are Inevitable; Part of the Postal Rate Plan Has Been Submitted to the Legislative Yuan for Review

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] After the currency reform, in accordance with Article 3 of the Regulations on Organizing Finance and Strengthening Economic Control, the postal rate portion of the fees for state-owned, public, and transportation enterprises was adjusted based on the pre-war standard rate. The plan proposed by the Ministry of Transportation has been reviewed and approved by the Executive Yuan and has been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review, requesting that the legislative procedures be completed as usual. It is learned that the adjustment principle is to collect the Gold Yuan for all postal rates in 1937, that is, 5 cents for ordinary letters (equivalent to 150,000 Legal Tender, which is 10 times higher than the current price), 13 cents for single registered letters (equivalent to 390,000 Legal Tender, which is about 8.67 times higher than the current price), 21 cents for double registered letters (equivalent to 630,000 Legal Tender, which is about 8.67 times higher than the current price), and 17 cents for express letters (equivalent to 510,000 Legal Tender, which is about 8.5 times higher than the current price). It is also learned that telegram fees will also be adjusted according to the same principle, that is, 10 cents per word for ordinary Chinese telegrams and 2.5 cents per word for news telegrams. However, in accordance with the law, it does not need to be reviewed by the Legislative Yuan and may be announced and implemented at the same time as the prices of other state-owned enterprises.

### Content of the Executive Yuan's Message Answering the Legislative Yuan's Inquiry

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] Price increases for state-owned, public, and transportation enterprises are inevitable. Postal rate increases have also been drafted. In its message answering the Legislative Yuan's inquiry on the proposal to stop state-owned enterprises from raising prices individually and immediately, the Executive Yuan explained that Article 3 of the Regulations on Organizing Finance and Strengthening Economic Control clearly stipulates that the fees for state-owned, public, and transportation enterprises whose fees are lower than the pre-war standard should be adjusted with reference to the pre-war standard. It is a policy decided at the same time as the currency reform and is not a self-destruction of the law. The message also pointed out that the fees of various public and transportation enterprises are indeed too low due to the increase in fuel prices. In order to continue to maintain them, it is impossible not to consider the actual costs and make appropriate adjustments. As for the adjusted prices, they are still under close study, and those that should go through the Legislative Yuan procedures will be handled as usual. For example, the postal rate adjustment plan has been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. The content of the Executive Yuan's message is as follows: (1) Consolidating the value of the new currency is not only effective by maintaining the value on August 19th. If the government's revenue and expenditure gap is also frozen to the state on August 19th without seeking improvement, then the new currency will continue to inflate, and the value of the currency will still not be stable. Therefore, the government's currency reform must balance the treasury's revenue and expenditure in order to reduce the issuance of the new currency. Therefore, state-owned enterprises should strive to be self-sufficient, and areas that are not militarily damaged should no longer be subsidized. This was stipulated in Article 3 of the Regulations on Organizing Finance and Strengthening Economic Control, which stipulated that the fees for state-owned, public, and transportation enterprises whose fees are lower than the pre-war standard should be adjusted with reference to the pre-war standard. Article 4 stipulates that all such enterprises should strive to save expenses so as not to increase too much when adjusting prices. This is actually a policy decided at the same time as the currency reform and is not a self-destruction of the law. (2) The issue of price increases for state-owned enterprises is currently under close study. Items such as postal rate adjustments, which should go through the Legislative Yuan procedures, have been submitted for review. (3) The fees of various public and transportation enterprises are indeed too low due to the increase in foreign exchange and fuel prices. It is not enough to only reduce personnel and tighten business expenses. In addition to the business that has been considered to be discontinued, it seems impossible not to consider its actual costs and make appropriate adjustments in order to maintain it.

### Ministry of Finance to Formulate Measures for Capital Increase of Provincial and County Banks

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] The Ministry of Finance has formulated measures for the capital increase of provincial and county banks in stages. The minimum capital of county banks nationwide, regardless of region, is 50,000 Gold Yuan. Provincial banks will refer to the measures for capital increase of commercial banks. Provincial banks in various provinces nationwide are divided into several levels. The banks in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Guangdong provinces are the first level, with a minimum capital of 1 million Gold Yuan. The deadline for capital increase is the same as for commercial banks.

### Ministry of Finance is Properly Reviewing Loan Policies and Measures; Grain Loans are also Being Considered Together

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] According to the Ministry of Finance, since the promulgation of the Financial and Economic Emergency Order and the suspension of loans by national banks and treasuries, the Ministry of Finance is now sending a letter to the Central Bank to carefully review the cases of loan requests from various provinces and cities for the purchase of grain. The Ministry of Finance is also properly reviewing the entire loan policy and measures. Grain loans are a major item of loans and will also be considered together.

### Taiwan Retrocession Third Anniversary

Today marks the third anniversary of Taiwan Retrocession Day, and the Taiwan Provincial Exposition is also scheduled to open today. Dignitaries from Taipei have gathered to celebrate this grand occasion. On this day three years ago, the surrender ceremony was held in Taiwan, where Japanese Governor-General Ando Rikiichi respectfully signed the surrender document on the spot. Chief Executive Chen Yi then announced it to China and abroad via broadcast. Thus, Taiwan, which had been occupied for 51 years, regained its light and returned to the motherland. Today, all sectors of Taiwanese society are holding a grand celebration. Key central government officials and attendees of the National Engineers' Annual Meeting have come to Taiwan to participate, creating an unprecedentedly enthusiastic atmosphere. We sincerely wish the people of Taiwan happiness, the success of Taiwan's construction, and we foresee Taiwan's future flourishing and growing, illuminated by the glory of its retrocession!

Taiwan is a province of our country located between the East and South China Seas. The famous islands comprise three parts: Taiwan Island itself, the Penghu Islands, and the New Southern Islands, collectively known as Taiwan Province. Its shape resembles a banana leaf. The region faces the Pacific Ocean to the east, Fujian Province to the west, the Ryukyu Islands to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Its terrain is strategically important, and its products are abundant. The land area is 35,961 square kilometers, with a population of approximately 6.6 million people. The main dialect belongs to the Southern Min language family. The ancestors of the residents are mostly buried in the Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Chaozhou, and Huizhou prefectures of Fujian and Guangdong provinces. The customs, habits, and rural lifestyles throughout the region are all based on the models of Guangdong and Fujian provinces.

Due to the importance of Taiwan's strategic location, it has historically been subjected to foreign invasions. In the 32nd year of the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty (1604 AD), the Dutch first entered and occupied the Penghu Islands, and then occupied Taiwan Island itself, engaging in development and extensive exploitation; this was Taiwan's first encounter with foreign aggression. In the sixth year of the Tianqi reign (1626 AD), the Spanish invaded Taiwan. In the 21st year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty (1841 AD), the British harbored covetous intentions. In the ninth year of the Guangxu reign (1883 AD), French troops also eyed Taiwan. Although these multiple invasions were crushed, they foreshadowed Taiwan's entanglement in the whirlpool of world politics amidst the imperialist scramble. Japan's coveting of Taiwan began in the mid-Ming Dynasty. Its actual possession of Taiwan began after the occupation of the Ryukyu Islands (first year of Guangxu, 1875 AD). After the Sino-Japanese War, the Treaty of Shimonoseki (21st year of Guangxu, 1895 AD) formally ceded Taiwan to Japan, resulting in 51 years of exclusive rule. During the period when Taiwan was contested by the great powers, China made efforts to regain sovereignty. For example, after the Dutch entered Taiwan, Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga) recovered it. Zheng Chenggong's son, Zheng Jing, ruled Taiwan for 23 years. After Zheng Jing's death, his son Zheng Kezang ushered in the end of that 23-year glorious history. Subsequently, Taiwanese people continued to engage in restoration movements, such as Zhu Yigui and Zhu Shuangwen. After the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed, Taiwanese patriot Qiu Fengjia declared independence and organized the Republic of Formosa, which was defeated by Japanese troops. However, the nation's integrity shines brightly in history. Therefore, for 50 years, Taiwan refused to submit, resisting the Japanese invaders with wave after wave of courageous fighters, engaging in over a hundred bloody battles. During World War II, the Cairo Declaration proclaimed that Taiwan would still belong to us. After the victory, our country accepted the surrender document from the Japanese governor-general on October 25, 1945. From that day on, the entire province's territory returned to the motherland. Six million Taiwanese compatriots saw the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag for the first time, rejoicing across the land and filled with boundless hope. Today, as we celebrate Taiwan's retrocession, the scene is as if it were happening before our eyes. What an exciting thing it is!

We value the importance of Taiwan's geographical location and the history of the Taiwanese people's struggle. We cherish the great significance of Taiwan's retrocession all the more. Naturally, we place infinite hope in Taiwan's political and economic construction. Taiwan's politics do not seem to have made much progress in the past three years. The "February 28th Incident" of last year was truly the most unpleasant event in Taiwan. Even now, thinking back on it, we feel particularly sorry for the people of Taiwan. However, domestic strife must not be treated like brothers quarreling within the walls. We have always felt deep sympathy for the people of Taiwan and have expressed great regret for the measures taken by the local government. Currently, the relationship between Taiwanese compatriots and those from other provinces is mostly positive and satisfactory, and order in various counties and cities is extremely stable, indicating that Taiwan Province is not lacking in enlightened individuals. This March, national assembly representatives gathered in the capital, and Taiwanese national representatives requested the central government to issue a clear decree designating Taiwan as a demonstration zone for the implementation of local autonomy. We deeply feel that Taiwan possesses the conditions for autonomy and should assist Taiwanese compatriots in fully embracing the spirit of constitutionalism, implementing local autonomy as soon as possible, and bringing Taiwan's politics onto the right track. The economic problem in Taiwan can be said to be the livelihood problem of six million people, and it is of utmost importance. In the past, under Japanese rule, there was only exploitation and plunder. The people were mostly poor and helpless, with living standards close to starvation, and there was no such thing as "full employment." In the three years since then, the waves of domestic economic instability have struck Taiwan, causing fluctuations in Taiwan's economic construction. Fortunately, Taiwan's efforts to "seek prosperity amidst stability" have been able to resist the waves, so Taiwan has been able to maintain a relatively comfortable situation. If the government can truly promote provincial construction economically and invigorate the provincial economy, and further promote local autonomy politically, then Taiwan will surely be filled with a bright future. This is our greatest wish for celebrating Taiwan Retrocession Day.

Finally, it must be pointed out that as we commemorate Taiwan Retrocession Day, we deeply feel the preciousness of the meaning of retrocession. We hope that the local government of Taiwan and the compatriots of Taiwan Province cherish the historical significance of retrocession, work hard to unite, be of one heart and one mind, and create together, making Taiwan the most beautiful garden in China. They should wash away the years of suffering of the Taiwanese people and attain a state of happiness and well-being as soon as possible. The Taiwan Exposition and the National Engineers' Annual Meeting will successively open during this grand event, symbolizing the happiness and well-being that Taiwan is about to reach. We sincerely pray that the compatriots of Taiwan and people from all walks of life will work hard to create and bring about a bright and splendid future as soon as possible!

### Taiwan Province Retrocession Third Anniversary Celebration to be Held Today; President Issues Admonitory Speech Encouraging Diligent Construction

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] The celebration of the third anniversary of Taiwan Province's retrocession is scheduled to be held at Sun Yat-sen Hall at 8:00 AM on the 25th. President Chiang Kai-shek has specially drafted an admonitory speech.

Premier Weng Wenhao's written address will be read by Minister Chen Qitian at the conference on his behalf. Mao Yisheng, President of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, will also be invited to deliver a speech. The Taiwan Provincial Celebration of the Third Anniversary of Retrocession has already sent a telegram to President Chiang Kai-shek to express its respect. The following are two items from the telegram:

(1) President's Admonitory Speech "Chairman Wei forwards to the Taiwan Retrocession Third Anniversary Commemoration Conference for review: Taiwan washed away the shame of being occupied for fifty years and returned to the motherland, it has already been three years since then. People who have been away from their homeland for a long time, once they are able to return to their homeland and reunite with their elders and brothers, their joy in their hearts is self-evident. Now that we have been reunited for a long time, the connections are even closer. Regarding the happiness of the entire family, we must think about how to contribute and fulfill our responsibility as a member. Taiwan has superior geographical conditions and abundant products. The results of construction in the past relied on the active efforts of the compatriots of the entire province. It is also outstanding and ranks among the best in the provinces of the country. Now that constitutional government has been implemented and the suppression of bandits is becoming increasingly tense, the maritime barrier and the pillar of reconstruction are even more important. All levels of agencies and compatriots throughout the province should be vigilant during these difficult times, recognize their responsibilities, strive to improve themselves, and pledge their loyalty together, so that Taiwan's construction will advance to a new stage and become a model for the whole country, spreading its blessings without limit. There are great hopes. Chiang Kai-shek"

(2) Taiwan Province Celebration of the Third Anniversary of Retrocession Conference's telegram of respect to the President: "President Chiang, Your Excellency: It has been three years since Taiwan was restored to light. With the grace of Your Excellency and the reliance on the strength of the people, the government has been promoting order and construction has been advancing at an accelerated pace. Now, as we commemorate the third anniversary of retrocession, the entire province is jubilant. Your Excellency's brilliant instructions have been issued from afar, and the warm words have been imparted to us. The six and a half million people of Taiwan are filled with emotion and inspiration after respectfully listening to them. We will certainly pledge our loyalty to each other, look up to repay Your Excellency's wise considerations, and encourage each other to work diligently to forever repay the grace of the country. We respectfully send this telegram to express our respect, and humbly request your perusal. Wei Daoming, Chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Government, and the Taiwan Provincial Celebration of the Third Anniversary of Retrocession Conference, respectfully."

### Only by Forming an International Army Can the World Have Peace: He Yingqin's Remarks to Reporters Upon Arrival in Taiwan

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] Minister of National Defense He Yingqin stated at a press conference in Taipei on the afternoon of the 24th, "Today is United Nations Day. I sincerely hope that the United Nations will have the power to promote world peace. I worked in the United States for a long time. At first, I hoped to form an international army within a year or two, but things did not go as planned. Our work has not achieved anything, and the contradictions between countries have increased even more. I still believe that only by forming an international army can the world have peace." When talking about the Japan issue, he said, "Japan's economic recovery cannot be completed in a short period of time. This requires assistance from China and the United States, especially from China. We certainly hope to sign a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible, but so far the major powers have different opinions, and it is hoped that it will be difficult to achieve in the short term." He came to attend the Retrocession Day celebration and will return to Nanjing in two or three days. Chen Cheng, who is recuperating in Caoshan, visited He Yingqin in Taipei at 4:00 PM. Afterwards, Chairman Wei Daoming and Commander Peng Mengji accompanied him to visit the exposition preview. In the crowded exposition venue, He and Chen were both figures of great attention.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian flew from Shanghai to Taipei on the 23rd. He will attend the opening ceremony of the Taiwan Exposition as Honorary Vice President.

### Speaker of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly Huang Chaoqin Discusses Two Missions to Nanjing

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] Huang Chaoqin, Speaker of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, went to Nanjing on official business earlier this month and returned to Taipei on the 23rd. He stated in a speech that the purpose of his trip to Nanjing was: (1) to request the central government to change the exchange rate between Taiwan dollars and gold yuan and to restore the flexibility of the Taiwan dollar exchange rate. Premier Weng was very clear about Taiwan's economic situation and expressed considerable sympathy, promising to find a way to remedy the situation when the opportunity arises, but did not mention the method or date. (2) The assets and deposits of the province's commercial banks all exceed their capital by more than 100 times, so there is no need to increase capital. Premier Weng and Vice Minister Xu of the Ministry of Finance said that the matter concerned laws and regulations and could not be handled unilaterally, but they agreed that the banks would still use Taiwan dollars as capital and increase the capital of branch offices at the county level, without increasing the capital of each branch office by 10,000 gold yuan.

### Central Bank Limits Exchange of Gold Yuan; Merchants Refuse to Use Legal Tender

### Rushes, Controls, and Rations: Collection of Market Conditions and Economic Trends in Various Regions

Wuxi

[Report from This Newspaper] The lack of materials is a common phenomenon throughout the county. There are prices but no goods in various markets, which intensifies the rush to buy, resulting in a serious "shortage of goods." Although there is a supply of rice, it is only a drop in the bucket. On the 24th, thousands of people lined up in Huihe Town to compete for purchases, causing great chaos. Fortunately, order was maintained properly, and no incidents occurred. In addition, on the 24th, the police station seized more than 60 large bags of white rice that were being smuggled out of the country at the Xihulu intersection.

Changshu

[Report from This Newspaper] The county's Materials Regulation Office was formally established on the morning of the 24th, and food rice and other major daily necessities in the urban area will be rationed. In order to maintain the people's food supply, the county government stipulates that any public or private firm that does not have a unified pass from the Shanghai Economic Supervision Commissioner's Office or purchases beyond the limited price will have all their goods deducted and used as public grain for the towns and villages. Those with permits must copy and verify the document number on the permit before allowing them to pass, so that they can go to Shanghai to exchange for daily necessities based on the purchase figures and transport them to Changshu for public sale.

Kunming

[Report from This Newspaper] The new negotiated prices for 83 industries in Kunming were originally under review, but the Executive Yuan ordered the provincial government to not allow self-negotiated prices in various places, and the new prices ended up being a fleeting moment. The trend of closing doors and refusing to sell has risen again. Although the authorities ordered businesses to open, the shelves are mostly empty, and the people's psychology of rushing to buy is extremely strong. The rice market is subject to price increases and decreases, and negotiated prices have completely failed.

Hangzhou

[Report from This Newspaper] Chen Aqi, a meat stall owner in Hangzhou, accidentally chopped off a housewife's finger on the 23rd because customers were rushing to buy pork.

Mingguang

[Report from This Newspaper] Recently, various businesses in this city have been trending towards closing down due to the exhaustion of goods.

In addition, the Economic Inspection Committee of this city has repeatedly received tip-off letters, but many of them do not contain names and fabricate facts, venting personal grievances or even acting as blackmailers. The committee has now stipulated that those who do not provide real names will not be dealt with.

[Another Telegram] On the 22nd, the Guojiang Police and Security Team seized two grain ships outside the North Gate, loaded with a thousand stones of white rice. Because they did not have exit permits, they were detained. On the 24th, the Wujiang branch of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank submitted documents stating that the rice was commissioned by the Shanghai Emergency Grain Purchase Association to be purchased by Su Nong and transported to Shanghai for sale, and requested the Wujiang County Government to allow it to be released.

### Celebrating the Third Anniversary of the United Nations Founding, Grand Ceremony Held at the Palais de Chaillot, Evatt's Speech Explaining the Achievements of the General Assembly in the Past Three Years, President Chiang's Telegram to the General Assembly Expressing Congratulations

[French News Agency, Paris, 24th] The United Nations General Assembly held a ceremony this afternoon at the Palais de Chaillot to celebrate the third "United Nations Day" anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter. The crowd was extremely dense, with representatives from various countries seated on the podium, while the representatives' seats were given to guests. United Nations representatives in attendance included General Assembly President and Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, British Deputy Prime Minister McNeil, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie, French Foreign Minister Schuman, and others. The flags of the 58 member states were hung on the podium, and two United Nations guards in blue-gray uniforms, adorned with the UN earth and grain emblem, stood beside the podium. Congratulatory telegrams were received from Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek and heads of state from various countries. At the opening of the celebration, the preamble to the United Nations Charter was first read in complete silence by the chairman. Afterwards, French Foreign Minister Schuman delivered a speech, expressing his deep confidence in the United Nations organization and hoping that morality could replace force in the future.

[French News Agency, Paris, 23rd] During the United Nations Day celebration, when representatives from various countries spoke, some touched upon the failures of the United Nations. General Assembly President Evatt gave a final "general response," emphasizing the achievements of the United Nations in the economic, social, and cultural fields, as well as the success in halting the fires of war in Palestine, Indonesia, and India.

[Taiwanese Mass News Agency, Paris, 23rd] United Nations General Assembly President Evatt delivered a speech on the 23rd at the Palais de Chaillot, the temporary headquarters of the United Nations in Paris, during the ceremony commemorating the third anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, strongly condemning pessimism, cynicism, lack of vitality, laziness, and "professionalized specters" unwilling to fight for principles. He pointed out that these people were trying to undermine the United Nations. In his vigorous defense of the United Nations, Mr. Evatt asked the world to try to close their eyes and think about "what would have happened" in the past three years if the United Nations had not been established. Mr. Evatt said: "We should close our eyes and think about what would have happened if the United Nations had not been established. Our great goal is peace. Our greatest enemy is war. But unfortunately, pessimism about the United Nations, especially about maintaining peace, has become a habit among some people. Cynicism is unwilling to accept new ideas, lacks vitality, is lazy and unwilling to fight for the principles of establishing the United Nations Charter. All of these are forces that claim that our difficulties will overcome us and lead people to undermine the United Nations." Evatt pointed out the existence of disputes in Palestine, Indonesia, and Kashmir, and said that the United Nations had either prevented them in the above-mentioned events or had strictly limited the combatants.

[Central News Agency, New York, 24th] Americans today enthusiastically celebrated United Nations Day, holding gatherings to discuss the goals of the United Nations, holding educational exhibitions of joint work, and praying for the success of the Paris Assembly. National leaders appealed to the American people in broadcasts to be patient with the three-year-old United Nations. American public opinion generally stated that the enthusiasm for the ideals of the United Nations in those years has gradually disappeared due to reality. Without the support of the member states, the United Nations itself cannot maintain peace. Furthermore, the United States should maintain its strong national power for the sake of ensuring its own security and should form alliances with friendly countries.

### Solution to the Berlin Crisis, Rumor Has It That the Soviets Will Veto, Political Committee Subgroup, the United States Refutes Soviet Disarmament Proposal

[Central News Agency, Paris, 23rd, United Press] Authoritative sources recently predicted that the Soviet Union will overturn the neutral countries' solution to the Berlin crisis in the Security Council with its veto power. It is reported that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky told Security Council President Bramuglia that Moscow rejected the so-called "compromise solution." Latin American sources also stated that Vyshinsky invited Bramuglia for a long talk this afternoon, implying that he would overturn the above proposal with a veto. However, commentators emphasized that Vyshinsky did not express the Soviet Union's decision to overturn the proposal. Vyshinsky's attitude has always been cautious, and he never shows all his cards until the time is right.

[French News Agency, Paris, 23rd] When the United Nations Political Committee's special subcommittee discussed the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal today, U.S. Representative Osborne objected, saying: "According to French newspapers, even after the Soviet army has been reduced by one-third, it still has 150 divisions. There are also 66 divisions in the satellite countries, while the United States only has six divisions in its own country, and only 14 divisions of U.S. troops in Western Europe. If these figures are correct, they are truly astounding." Soviet Representative Malik immediately replied: "He would like to know how many atomic bombs the United States has, and how many divisions of troops are equivalent to these atomic bombs." Subsequently, after representatives from El Salvador and Belgium spoke one after another, the subcommittee adjourned and was scheduled to reconvene on Monday. Convening a Meeting of Foreign Ministers to Build a Sound German Government

### East German People's Council Demands Withdrawal of Troops

Convening a Meeting of Foreign Ministers to Build a Sound German Government

[United Press, Berlin, 24th] The Communist-backed "People's Council" on the 24th, following the Soviet Union, demanded the convening of a foreign ministers' conference to discuss the entire German issue. The council passed a resolution demanding that the victorious nations fulfill their promises to rebuild a economically and politically unified Germany and establish an all-German government. The resolution also demanded the withdrawal of occupying forces.

### British, American, and French Military Governors Scheduled to Meet at the End of the Month to Discuss the New Situation in West Germany

[French News Agency, Frankfurt, 23rd] The military governors of British, American, and French occupied Germany, Robertson, Clay, and Koenig, are scheduled to meet on October 30 to discuss the new situation in West Germany and study the form of occupying government proposed by the constitutional drafting committee.

### Soviets Demand Replacement of Important Berlin Officials, Including the Mayor, Speaker, and Councilors

[United Press, Berlin, 23rd] The Soviet Union formally accused the Mayor of Berlin and five other officials on the 23rd of violating the Four Power Berlin Agreement and demanded their dismissal and punishment. The Soviet News Bureau claimed that Soviet courts accused them of giving "fascist" speeches that the Allied Control Council had explicitly prohibited. This accusation has now been submitted to the "appropriate military authorities" for the punishment of these officials. The Soviet Union's so-called "appropriate authorities" are presumably the Soviet military government and the military governments of the three Western powers. Those accused include Acting Mayor Friedensburg, unrecognized Mayor Reuter, City Council Speaker Suhr, and City Councilors Naumann, Mattick, and Markewitz.

### British King to Preside Over the Opening Ceremony of Parliament Tomorrow, Nationalization of Steel Industry Bill to Cause Controversy

[Taiwanese Mass News Agency, London, 24th] British King George will wear the crown, which is already ten years old, to preside over the opening ceremony of Parliament on the 26th. When he returns, the royal procession will once again feature grand scenes. This ceremony is solemn and complete. The King will depart from Buckingham Palace, passing through streets lined with red-uniformed guards, and enter the House of Lords. On this day, he will wear parliamentary robes of red and black. This session will be a do-or-die battle between the Conservative and Labour parties over the Labour government's steel industry nationalization bill before the general election. Its nature is far superior to the reappearance of old official rituals. The opposition party admits that it cannot prevent the bill from becoming law, but hopes to use the excuse that the Labour Party's state control will bankrupt the country to attack the socialists in the general election 14 months later. In the House of Lords, it will obstruct the passage of the bill with delaying tactics. The Labour Party has proposed an amendment to the Parliamentary Act to reduce the effective period of the House of Lords' veto from two years to one year, so that the nationalization bill will become a legal part of the law before the general election.

### The French Miners' Strike is Increasingly Treacherous, Miners and Soldiers in a Standoff, Situation in the Central Mining Area is Most Critical

[United Press, Paris, 24th] The unexpected incidents of the French coal miners' strike are still limited to the central coal area. In Montceau, 88 miles north of Lyon, government troops reinforced and attacked the Arowa mine. Everything in the Firmini area of Saint-Étienne has been shut down due to the general strike, and the situation is now becoming increasingly tense. In the north, which has always been known as a communist belt, the government only strengthened its military strength and did not launch an attack to recover the mines occupied by the strikers. The strike in the central region, especially in the Arowa mine, where 2,000 soldiers are surrounding the miners, remains the most critical. The strikers are asking for help with factory sirens. It is reported that thousands of miners are concentrated on the roads leading to the mine. The military police are fully armed and blocking the roads. On the morning of the 24th, the police took down the Saint-Louis and Morgue mines in the Montceau area in a lightning action and arrested 25 armed people.

### The Five Foreign Ministers of the Western European Alliance Are Scheduled to Meet in Paris Today, The Main Agenda Will Discuss the Issue of Europe's Entry into a Federal Union

[United Press, Paris, 24th] French Foreign Minister Schuman, with the full support of the U.S. government, will attempt this week to persuade the five foreign ministers of the Western European Alliance that Europe must unite or perish together. The quarterly meeting of the Western European Alliance will begin here on the 25th. The main topics will be the European Union and the prospects for the Western European Union and the United States and Canada to sign the North Atlantic Collective Defense Treaty. British Foreign Secretary Bevin can come here from London on the evening of the 24th to participate in the meeting. Although the Western European Union is loudly advocating its intentions, Bevin and the British Labour Party are the main obstacles to this plan. Britain believes that it is currently unrealistic to talk about a federal union. It is reported that once the U.S. election is over, the U.S. and Canada are expected to begin preparing extensively for the conclusion of the North Atlantic Collective Defense Treaty with the Western European Alliance. The treaty will be established in accordance with the norms of the Rio de Janeiro Western Hemisphere Collective Defense Treaty of September 1948. When the treaty is underway, the United States is also expected to complete its plan to provide military assistance to the Western European Alliance. The prerequisite for U.S. aid is that the West must first help itself, so the five foreign ministers of the alliance will work hard to promote the self-help plan. The Western European Alliance's regular meeting will begin on the morning of the 25th, with a second meeting in the afternoon and a final meeting on the morning of the 26th. The meeting place is in the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the banks of the Seine, about one mile from the Palais de Chaillot, the venue of the United Nations General Assembly.

### The Situation in Southern Korea is Chaotic, Rumor Has It That Government Troops Recaptured Sil City and Suncheon, Part of the Rebel Army Infiltrated the Zili Mountain Area

[United Press, Seoul, 24th] Minister of the Interior Yoon Chi-young is scheduled to go to Suncheon on the 24th. According to his announcement on the evening of the 23rd, the rebel army was surrounded in five places and gradually resolved by the security forces. He firmly believed that the rebellion could be completely quelled on the morning of the 25th. However, the U.S. military headquarters' report did not fully support Yoon's optimistic conclusion. The security forces' recapture of Yeosu, the source of the rebellion, has not been confirmed by U.S. officials in the area. At the same time, rebels are still very active in the southern coastal area. It is reported that another branch of the rebel army has infiltrated the Zili Mountain area and occupied Baoyouzhen.

According to the report of Cenard, a neutral observer who returned to Seoul from the U.S. Temporary Military Advisory Group Office in Gwangju on the 23rd, it confirms the Korean side's news that the security forces have recovered Yeosu and Suncheon. Cenard left Yeosu one day before the rebellion occurred, and his report can be regarded as a first-hand report of what he saw.

[United Press, Seoul, 24th] The Security Forces Command reported on the 24th that the Security Forces had penetrated Yeosu from both land and sea on the morning of the 23rd to test the strength of the rebel army, and then withdrew to the ships in the port. The Security Forces suffered six deaths and injuries. There is no report on the number of deaths and injuries of the rebel army. In Suncheon, a total of 86 civilian and detective corpses were found by American observers, some of whom were executed by the rebel army. They estimated that the total number of deaths was around 150. The Security Forces Headquarters also reported that Baocheng was recovered at noon on the 24th, and the situation in Guangyang is still unclear.

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] The Indochinese People's League here telegraphed the United Nations General Assembly in Paris on the 24th, appealing to the United Nations to liberate the two million people of Indochina from French oppression. The telegram requested that the United Nations urge France to allow the true independence of Indochina, condemning the autonomy that France has now allowed as "empty." Indochina still has no right to handle foreign affairs, military affairs, and economic affairs. In addition, the League also opposed the negotiations between King Bao Dai and France, believing that the negotiations could only establish a puppet government. The people of Indochina will continue to fight for independence. The telegram warned that the instability of the situation will make Indochina a fertile ground for communism.

### United Nations Day - Citywide Flag Display - All Circles Hold Celebratory Meeting - Ardent Hope for World Peace - Mayor's Address Emphasizes Continued Cooperation and Effort

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday was United Nations Day. Starting in the morning, the entire city uniformly displayed flags to celebrate. A celebratory meeting for all circles was held at 9:00 AM in the auditorium of Aurora University. Attendees included Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Li Huang, Mr. and Mrs. Li Shizeng, Zhang Junhai of the United Nations Association, and hundreds of representatives from various organizations and groups. The national flags of all member states were hung around the venue. On the stage were the United Nations flag, the flags of the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and large banners reading "Unite International Forces to Prevent Aggressive Ambitions" and "Promote International Justice to Ensure World Security." The meeting began with an address by Mayor Wu, who stated, in brief: "The evolution of all of human history lies in grasping ideals, constantly progressing, and making ideals become realities. The organization of the United Nations represents the ideal of human peace and the ultimate goal of global harmony. This lofty and sacred goal is now deeply imprinted in our minds. How to promote its realization still depends on the cooperative efforts of people around the world. After the First World War, the League of Nations was created. After this war, the United Nations was created. Historically, humanity has felt the preciousness of peace more acutely after each major war, and several peaceful international alliances have often emerged as a result. This shows that humanity is indeed constantly progressing. Although the current United Nations is more advanced than the previous League of Nations, its organization has not yet reached the soundness of our ideal. For example, the United Nations does not have an international police force to safeguard world peace and order, nor does it have a way to limit member states from abusing their veto power. Today, as we celebrate the third anniversary of the founding of the United Nations Charter, we are not simply praising the current United Nations but hoping that it will continue to progress based on its lofty and sacred ideals, promote their realization, and reach the day of permanent world peace."

Li Huang Reports on the Charter Signing Situation That Year

Following this, Li Huang, our country's representative to the United Nations, reported on the discussion process and signing of the United Nations Charter. Mr. Li stated: "The United Nations Charter was discussed for two months, and the meetings often ran from morning to evening. The work was extremely careful. The ten members of the Chinese delegation each attended a subcommittee, and they held a meeting every morning to jointly review the work. The signing ceremony when the Charter was concluded was extremely solemn. After discussions, our delegation decided to sign the Charter, which would be published simultaneously in five languages, in Chinese. Among the delegates, Wang Chonghui, as a legal expert, never relaxed his scrutiny of the Charter's articles. Gu Weijun and Wu Yifang also spoke extensively, making valuable contributions." Mr. Li concluded by pointing out that the United Nations General Assembly and the post-World War I international conferences were quite different. The diplomatic tactics of secret consultations that were prevalent in the past have been abandoned in the United Nations General Assembly. Although the disputes among the representatives of the various countries were fierce, they were still able to meet each other with sincerity and frankly present their own demands. Therefore, the concluded Charter, in addition to the original ideals, also took into account the facts. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, emphasized the "socialization" principle that he has consistently advocated in his speech. He stated that although the United Nations organization is a manifestation of international peaceful socialization, socialization is still only a part. To actively maintain world peace, it is necessary to expand and deepen socialization into all levels, using cooperative forces to stop ambitious elements from inciting international wars.

Pan Gongzhan Expresses the Need to Establish a Psychological Foundation

Chairman Pan Gongzhan stated in his address: "Today's celebration of United Nations Day by all circles in this city is truly a manifestation of the deep penetration of the United Nations ideal. To keep the United Nations Charter permanently alive, we must establish a psychological foundation, for all great human constructions start from a single thought. The Charter begins with 'We the peoples of the United Nations' without distinguishing borders, which is the best illustration of the psychological foundation. We must always view ourselves as 'the peoples of the United Nations' for the hope of human peace to be realized. We believe that with the strength of all the peoples of the United Nations, working together to end wars and safeguard world peace, we will surely succeed. Mencius said, 'The world hangs on being settled. Being settled depends on unity. He who does not delight in killing can unify it.' The United Nations is a concrete manifestation of 'being settled depends on unity,' and world peace will certainly not be destroyed by warmongers who delight in killing."

Fang Zhi Hopes to Consolidate Unity and Permanently Preserve Peace

Fang Zhi, chairman of the Kuomintang Shanghai Municipal Party Department, stated in his address that to safeguard world peace, it is necessary to strengthen the United Nations itself. He hoped that the 57 member states would demonstrate a spirit of cooperation based on "mutual trust, mutual belief, mutual assistance, and mutual aid," consolidate unity, and ensure permanent peace. Finally, Dr. Lu Nagen Sen, Secretary-General of the United Nations Far East Economic and Social Council, delivered a speech on behalf of the United Nations. He stated that the ideal of the United Nations is to promote human peace, eliminate war through the power of the people, and advance social, economic, and other constructions. This ideal is the goal we are jointly striving for, and we believe that by promoting the spirit of human benevolence and strengthening unity, we will surely achieve success. The meeting adjourned around 11:00 AM.

Celebratory Commemorations and Other Programs

Other celebratory commemoration programs included: Civil Aviation Brigade aircraft scattering national flags and presidential messages, the Public Works Radio Station broadcasting special United Nations Day programs, and special services at Moore Memorial Church on Xizang Road and the American Church on Avenue Petain. From 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM, the United Nations Shanghai Office held a cocktail reception at the French Cultural Association on Nanchang Road, attended by over a hundred leaders from various circles, both Chinese and foreign, who enjoyed themselves thoroughly.

### Reduced Supply of Matches - Request to Re-determine Factory Wholesale Price

The Shanghai Match Factory Industry Association states that due to the current shortage of match raw materials, procurement is difficult. Moreover, the "August 19th" price limit on matches coincided with a period when sales were relatively weak, and the factory wholesale price was low. Just as they were about to adjust it, they were suddenly frozen by the Financial and Economic Emergency Decree, resulting in a gradual decrease in production and supply. The industry's raw materials, such as cottonwood and certain chemicals, have always relied on import quotas, and the increased exchange rate has significantly impacted costs. The industry association has sent letters to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Economic Management and Supervision Office, requesting a re-determination of the actual production costs of the factories and the wholesale prices of each brand of matches, and has attached a table of raw material production costs for review.

### Wujin Dyeing and Weaving Industry Representatives - Request Release of Detained Cotton Yarn

The county's General Labor Union sent several representatives to Shanghai yesterday to visit Supervisor Jiang at the National Bank and petition him. Secretary Cai Baili received them and inquired about the details, promising to find a solution. If it is verified that the cotton yarn is genuine, he will send a letter to the Railway Bureau to release it.

### Black Market Chicken and Duck Dealers Discovered - Attempted Bribery Leads to Detention

[Our Newspaper's Report] Chen Xixiang, the group leader of the 39th Squad of the 8th Brigade of the Greater Shanghai Youth Service Corps, and team members Yin Wenxi, Chen Wanggen, and Zheng Minghua, at 6:35 PM yesterday, saw Wu Zhongquan and Xue Songliu, who were trading chickens and ducks on the black market at the intersection of Baoyu Lane on South Zhejiang Road, acting suspiciously. The four team members noticed and went forward to question them. According to the two chicken buyers, the chickens and ducks were purchased on the black market at a price of 5.8 yuan per jin from Xinde Feng Chicken and Duck Shop at No. 37 Baoyu Lane. The four team members immediately went to the Xinde Feng Chicken and Duck Shop to inquire. The shop, realizing that its black market dealings had been discovered, attempted to bribe them, offering 100 gold yuan. The four team members, seeing that the shop admitted to buying and selling on the black market, immediately sent the witnesses to the Chenxiangge Squad Headquarters to request instructions.

### Youth Missing on Haiyue Ship - Father Searches, Suddenly Receives Strange Letter

Whether Victim of Homicide or Suicide Awaits Investigation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Peixian (see photo), alias Yude, 23 years old, from Cixian County, Hebei, boarded the Haiyue ship from Tianjin to Shanghai on June 10 of this year. For over three months, there has been no news. His father, Zhang Wenlin, currently a clerk at the Anyang District Court in Henan, came to Shanghai in pursuit and is staying at No. 16 Baoanfang, South Zhejiang Road. He has been searching everywhere in Shanghai, but without success. He advertised in the newspaper from the 7th to the 10th of this month, which stated: "Zhang Peixian, alias Yude, is from Cixian (Cizhou) County, Hebei Province. He is 23 years old. He boarded the Haiyue ship from Tianjin to Shanghai on June 10 of this year. For over three months, there has been no news. Kind-hearted individuals who know his whereabouts and can help find him will be rewarded with 100 gold yuan. Zhang Wenlin, No. 16 Baoanfang, South Zhejiang Road." Another notice stated: "Peixian, my son: Father has arrived in Shanghai. Everything is according to your wishes, and there will be no compulsion. You can come to No. 16 Baoanfang, South Zhejiang Road, for a talk, or send a letter. Zhang Wenlin." The advertisement ran for four days, but there was still no news. On the 15th and 16th, the advertisement was continued for two more days. On the morning of the 17th, Zhang Wenlin suddenly received a letter, written in a Wing-style fountain pen, which stated, "Mr. Peixian has already been murdered. I hope that Mr. Wenlin will go to the Shen Bao office today to inquire about the address of Mr. Deng from the Shanghai branch. Then the truth will come to light," signed Jingfu, with no address. At that time, Zhang Wenlin was hesitant after receiving the letter. Later, he came to this office to inquire. Afterwards, he suspected that the Shanghai branch was the Shanghai News Agency. He went to that agency to inquire, but there was no one named Deng. So he went to the Huangpu Police Branch to report. Chief Li then dispatched police officer Li ?ming to the Shanghai News Agency for detailed inquiry, but there were still no clues. He also came to this office to inquire about someone named Deng, but he could not find any information. Yesterday, the reporter visited Zhang Wenlin at his residence. According to him, Peixian went to Tianjin from his home in the spring of the year before last. Because after the victory, the original Cixian County area was unstable and uninhabitable, Peixian fled alone to Shanghai and stayed at the Yuqing Apartment at No. 16 Baoanfang, South Zhejiang Road. About a week later, he took a ship to Tianjin to work at the Gongtai Grocery Store at No. 14 Daliu Hutong, Qudian Street, for two years. Last winter, a fellow villager came to Tianjin and told him about the tragic situation in his hometown, including the murder of his grandfather and aunt. Peixian was immediately stunned. A few days later, he fell ill and was bedridden for half a month, and his nerves seemed to have become abnormal. Suddenly he disappeared. Afterwards, rewards were offered in various newspapers and broadcast on the radio, and searches were conducted everywhere. After he was found, he was sent to the hospital for treatment, and his mental state gradually returned to normal. Later, his uncle, Xinglin, learned about this and took a flight from Hankou to Tianjin to visit him and comfort him, and his mental state recovered as before. On the evening of May this summer, his uncle Xinglin came to Shanghai from Tianjin, which he found out about. After soliciting Xinglin's opinion, he took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyue ship to Shanghai on June 5. It was unexpected that the ship arrived in Shanghai on the 10th, and Peixian disappeared. Whether he jumped into the sea or was murdered by someone remains a mystery. Zhang Wenlin concluded that he himself is a civil servant and unable to spare the time. He initially applied for a month's leave at the beginning of the month to investigate in person, but it has already been exhausted, and the result is as described above, which is truly heartbreaking. If he can borrow your newspaper to disclose the process and recover his son, he will be endlessly grateful.

Guests from Chinese and Foreign Circles at the Cocktail Reception Celebrating United Nations Day

### National Bank Allocates 10,000 Bales of Yarn - To Be Transported to Various Places for Cotton Exchange

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the establishment of the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office, it has universally implemented fixed-price cotton collection, so the amount of cotton collected by the various branches and stations is very limited. It is reported that cotton prices in various places are generally one to one and a half times higher than the fixed price, while the finished cotton yarn prices are generally two to two and a half times higher than the fixed price. Therefore, starting this week, half of the payment for cotton collection will be in the form of cotton yarn, and half will still be in cash, which should overcome the difficulty of fixed-price cotton collection. It is heard that the Central Bank has allocated 10,000 bales of cotton yarn for cotton exchange, which will soon be transported to various places by the office.

### Leaders from All Walks of Life Discuss - Rice and Coal Supply Problems - Encourage Merchants - To Actively Purchase

In order to solve the problem of the source of rice and other materials in the city, leaders of various agencies, including Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, and Yang Chuoan, have repeatedly consulted in recent days. According to Speaker Pan, the most important and urgent problems to be solved in Shanghai at present are the source of rice and coal. In addition to the rationed rice, the city needs rice merchants to supply 200,000 dan per month. However, due to the high prices in the producing areas recently, rice merchants are unwilling to transport it to Shanghai and sell it at the fixed price. Under this circumstance, the government should find ways to encourage merchants to actively purchase rice and transport it to Shanghai. As for coal, because of the traffic obstruction on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, coal from central China cannot be transported. Due to the lack of ships, coal from the north is also in short supply. Currently, it only relies on Huainan coal and Taipei coal, and even public utilities have mobilized safety coal. Last year, I advocated that when coal can be purchased as much as possible in the producing areas, coal merchants should be encouraged to purchase and store as much as possible. Unfortunately, the competent authorities did not consider this at the beginning, so we should quickly seek solutions now, otherwise industrial production will also be greatly affected.

### Shanghai Refugees Migrate to Jiangxi - Yuan Wenzhang Negotiates in Jiangxi

### Impersonating Military Officers to Purchase Oil and Extort - Two Defendants Sentenced to Three Months Imprisonment Each - Gu Xiangjiu and Chen Dequan Declared Not Guilty

[Our Newspaper's Report] Jin Henghong and Shen Yunlong jointly established Hengfeng Firm on Fuzhou Road. They were previously suspected of privately selling allocated diesel. Tao Tongfu and Gu Xiangjiu learned about this in a conversation and conceived a plan to blackmail them. Together with Peng Bingquan, who is still at large, they went to the telephone switchboard room of the Cangzhou Hotel where they were staying and falsely claimed to be borrowing several million yuan, obtaining a blank check from Zhejiang Industrial Bank from Chen Dequan. Then, Peng, using the alias Wang Li, went to Jin Henghong's place to pretend to buy diesel and agreed on a price. He then filled out the aforementioned check with an amount of 488 million yuan and gave it to Jin Henghong on May 31 of this year, obtaining a delivery note for eight tons of diesel from Hengfeng Firm. Although he knew that the check he paid would be dishonored, he believed that Jin Henghong would not dare to make a fuss because he knew that selling oil was illegal. He then gave the delivery note to Wang Tianjian, who went to Hengfeng Firm to pick up the goods on June 21. Jin stated that since the check he received had been dishonored, the original buyer had to be present before the goods could be delivered. Wang insisted in various ways, but without success. He then threatened, "Tomorrow I will invite honored veterans to make trouble," but without success. The next day, Wang and Tao indeed brought several wounded soldiers and went there. Tao, wearing a military uniform and carrying a handgun, threatened Jin in every possible way and threatened to smash up the office, insisting on picking up the goods. Jin politely explained, and Tao also knew that he could not escape achieving his goal and took the initiative to compromise, saying that the delivery note held by Wang was a pledge received for a loan of 60 million legal currency. If Jin was willing to compensate for the loss of 60 million yuan, the delivery note could be returned. He agreed to meet Jin at No. 1000 Lanzhou Road again that afternoon. When Jin arrived as agreed, Wang again wore a military uniform, put on the rank of colonel, and insisted that Jin should compensate for the loss of 60 million yuan before returning the delivery note. Jin insisted that the buyer had to be present before he would compensate for the loss. The two sides insisted, but without success. They agreed to talk on the phone again on the 23rd. On that day, Wang and Tao invited several wounded soldiers and pre-arranged them on the seventh floor of No. 264 Jiangxi Road, and invited Jin to talk again by phone. Jin was frightened and reported to the Songhu Garrison Command, which dispatched plainclothes officers to accompany him. Wang and Tao and several wounded soldiers were arrested on the spot. Then Gu Xiangjiu and Chen Dequan were arrested. Apart from the wounded soldiers who had military status and were to be tried by military law, the rest were transferred by the Municipal Police Department to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The District Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution against Tao and the other three on charges of intimidation and other crimes. The case was recently concluded and sentenced by Judge Cao Zuzhao of the District Court: Tao Tongfu and Wang Tianjian, with the common intention of illegally obtaining property for themselves, attempted to cause others to deliver property by intimidation, and were each sentenced to three months' imprisonment. Gu Xiangjiu and Chen Dequan were both found not guilty. Tao and Wang, the two defendants, were taken into custody in court.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Hongjiu's home at No. 44 Yuelai Street outside Datongmen in Nanshi was suddenly invaded by four robbers at 6:30 PM last night. They held three guns and confined the family members in a small room, with one robber watching over them, while the three robbers rummaged through boxes and searched for valuables. Chenjiaqiao Police Station of the Penglai Road Police Branch received a report and immediately reported it to the Penglai Police Bureau. Chief Li Dabao, along with officers Ling Zhenbing and Lou Zhangbiao, led police chief Zhu Genfu, Ren Boxin, and officers Sun Guihua and Yu Fusheng, as well as a large number of police officers, rushed to surround and arrest them. At the same time, the Flying Fortress, led by Captain Liu, along with team members Wang Qinghe, Lang Yidang, and Wang Jinrong, drove to the scene. At that time, the gate of Wang's house was tightly closed. Officer Lou, along with police officers Zhu and Ren, climbed onto the roof from No. 36 to enter the victim's house. Officer Ling, along with police officers Yu and Sun, broke down the door and rushed in. The four robbers, hearing the police, opened fire and resisted arrest. The police fired back, and a fight ensued. Shots were fired more than twenty times. In the darkness, three robbers took the opportunity to escape.

The handgun he was carrying was discarded before his arrest. He was immediately taken to the police station for strict interrogation, and the escaped accomplices are being pursued. It is reported that three diamond rings, one gem ring, and three watches were stolen from Wang's house.

### Robber Caught in Nanshi - Investigation Completed and Handed Over for Prosecution - One Committed Murder in Chongming - Shot Dead Brother and Brother-in-Law

[Report from this newspaper] The Penglai Police Station of this city arrested two bandits, Shi Jinshan and Yang Ximeng, at the Longchayuan in Daxing Street, Nanshi, on the 3rd of this month. Yang was shot and injured by the police on the spot for resisting arrest. After a detailed investigation by the station, it was learned that in addition to committing robbery cases in Shanghai, Yang had also committed multiple murders and kidnapping for ransom in Chongming. Yang was originally the leader of a bandit gang in Chongming. In the 34th year of the Republic, he persuaded Mao Daji, his brother-in-law, of Household 14 in Chia 14 of Bao 13 in Dong'an Township, to persuade the Mao family to join the bandit gang, but he was refused and Mao secretly protected the garrison troops. Unable to gain a foothold, Yang had murderous intentions and on the night of February 19th, lured Mao and his younger brother Da Sheng and shot them to death. Mao's father, Zhi Da, and Mao's younger brother, Da Ming, had left their hometown to avoid the disaster and came to Shanghai, thus avoiding the tragedy. Shi committed another fraud crime. After the station verified the facts, it decided to transfer the two bandits to the district court for interrogation today.

### General Prices The Phenomenon of Panic Buying is Superficially Relatively Quiet All Parties Seem to Be Waiting for an Opportunity to Change

The market situation this week has not improved since the previous week. Those who have stopped trading are still stopping, and those who have not started are still not starting. The trend seems to be waiting for new government measures to reverse this situation. Before the government has new measures, there does not seem to be any major change in the short term. The phenomenon of panic buying has been relatively quiet. This is partly because merchants have hidden goods and partly because of various restrictions on buying with ID cards, but we must never think that everyone's psychology of panic buying has subsided. The financial market has also gradually had new reactions this week. Credit has tightened, and black market interest rates have frequently risen, reaching more than two jiao. Customers have been withdrawing cash, and deposits in banks have plummeted. It is estimated that the total amount of deposits in banks at the end of September was about 250 million yuan, and the current total amount of deposits has been reduced to about 50 million yuan. Prices in other major cities across the country have risen sharply. To take into account the actual difficulties, some local governments have allowed adjustments to the August 19th price limits for a few important commodities. In addition, the central authorities ordered the Import and Export Management Committee to abolish the price limit for tung oil in order to promote exports and earn foreign exchange, and to implement price negotiations at the place of production. As for the price reduction standards, the selling price at the place of production should be negotiated based on foreign prices, minus various expenses and legal profits. In recent days, the authorities have held several important meetings on the price issue. However, the attendees are all tight-lipped about the content of the meetings. The future of price limits is still unknown!

As for the authorities' views on the current price problem and the analysis of the reasons for the rise, we can use the reports of Mr. Weng Wenhao and Mr. Wang Yunwu in the Legislative Yuan for explanation. Mr. Weng Wenhao said that the current abnormal situation is caused by four factors: (1) Military relations have a great impact on people's hearts, (2) Communist bandits' sabotage, (3) Price limits in some areas are too low, (4) Speculation. Mr. Wang Yunwu's report divides the price fluctuations in various places into three periods for explanation: (1) Prices before August 19th rose wildly. (2) From August 19th to the end of September, due to the issuance of gold yuan coupons, general prices stabilized, and even partially fell. (3) Fluctuations began at the end of September, and the fluctuations became more obvious in October, resulting in today's phenomenon. Mr. Wang believes that there are many reasons for price fluctuations, such as the disturbances of communist bandits, changes in the military situation, temporary failures in the supply of goods, and people's psychological anxiety. Finally, Mr. Wang put forward four remedial measures to address the current situation: (1) Increase production, (2) Economize consumption, (3) Dredge materials, (4) Control floating capital.

Under the aforementioned four points, Mr. Wang, in order to make up for some loopholes in the emergency financial and economic measures and stabilize the current economic situation, further formulated a complete implementation plan. According to United News Agency, the content of the plan includes the following parts: (1) Tighten the issuance of gold yuan coupons and find ways to bring them back. (2) Make good use of the financial foreign exchange collected. (3) Reasonably adjust prices, but still strictly implement the price limit policy. (4) The prices of state-owned transportation and public utility businesses will be restored to pre-war standards, and the government will stop subsidizing them. (5) Improve the treatment of public school teachers and staff. (6) Absorb floating capital. (7) Expand rationing and coupon sales. (8) Control prices and regulate the supply and demand between production areas and markets. (9) Strengthen comprehensive economic control and thoroughly eliminate the existence of the black market. (10) Crack down on smuggling and the outflow of funds to the south. (11) Open up loans and strengthen production.

This Mr. Wang's new plan, which is still being formulated, includes a wide range of content. Judging from these few outlines, the inherent difficulties and self-contradictory handling are inevitable.

In Shanghai, since the panic buying week occurred and the supply of goods on the market was short, the authorities have become more active in promoting the quantitative distribution system. It has now been decided to implement a household economic survey to issue new national ID cards, along with 144 purchase coupons, which can be used to buy about 12 kinds of goods such as rice, oil, briquettes, and sugar per month, and will be used up in one year. Each purchase coupon is printed with a number and the name of the goods that can be purchased. The goods that can be purchased at what time will be announced at any time. As for the targets, it is said that public school teachers and staff are for rationing, and citizens are for purchase. The quantity of goods is stipulated as one dou of rice per month, one catty of oil per month, half a catty of sugar per month, two dan of briquettes per month, and one zhang and five chi of cloth every six months. We know that the quantitative distribution system is the most effective way to implement thrift. This method has been most successful in the UK. However, it also has several prerequisites that should be resolved, such as the control of a large amount of goods and the continuous supply; the determination of the price of rationed goods must take into account the production costs and the burden of consumers; the strictness of social organizations, the detailed household survey; the high work efficiency of the staff, and so on. Implementing a quantitative distribution system is an arduous task. If this time it can be done well, it will be a big step for the country towards modernization.

Last week, the Shanghai district management authorities, in order to strengthen the regulation and supply of goods, invited representatives from the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai to hold an enlarged meeting in Shanghai to discuss the exchange of goods between the three provinces and two cities. After discussion, the Shanghai city side agreed to transport cloth, yarn, sugar, soap, and Huorong to various provinces. Jiangsu Province agreed to supply Shanghai with cotton, rice, and wheat, Zhejiang Province agreed to supply hemp and tung oil, and Anhui Province agreed to supply food rice and vegetable by-products.

Industrial and Commercial Dynamics

### The Troublesome Issue of Expanding the Supply of Raw Materials

Last week, the shortage of raw materials and fuel in the industrial and commercial circles of this city did not show any significant reduction. Taking coal as an example, it is estimated that the monthly demand in the Beijing and Shanghai regions is 350,000 tons. In winter, due to heat, the demand doubles, but the current output of each supply area is at most 214,000 tons per month. In addition, the war zone has expanded, and transportation has been blocked, which naturally causes more problems in transportation. If the shortage of raw materials and fuel is not smoothly resolved one day, the reduction in industrial and commercial production will also have no end.

In order to actively promote the work of regulating the supply of goods, the Shanghai District Commodity Regulation Committee held a meeting last Tuesday and decided to establish three small groups as soon as possible, including industrial raw materials, fuel, and daily necessities, so as to promote various businesses.

Originally, there are only a few ways to resolve the shortage of raw materials and fuel. The first is to actively purchase from relevant production areas in the country. For example, for the purchase of raw cotton, the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office has branches in various parts of the country on the 16th of this month. Fully launch the purchase work. But it is said that this work is quite difficult due to the price limit. Therefore, the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office can only take the method of matching yarn and cloth to the cotton area for price exchange to solve the difficulty of purchase under the price limit. At the same time, in order to maintain the joint purchase policy and avoid competitive purchase, the office also submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to order the provincial governments of the cotton-producing areas to strictly prohibit various yarn factories from engaging in the purchase by exchanging yarn for cotton alone. This can be said to be maintaining a trust organization. If the "price" of the so-called "matching yarn and cloth for price exchange" is still far below the reproduction cost of raw cotton, then in the long run, it is obviously damaging the productivity of raw cotton. This point must be noticed by the authorities. In addition, there are still many difficulties in the purchase of raw cotton. According to the East China News Agency, it is learned that in the sound of national cotton purchase, the problem of transporting the cotton that has been collected has not been thoroughly resolved so far, which is indeed a fatal injury to the purchase work. Obviously, the more the war expands, the more problems there are in transportation. It can be seen that the supply of raw cotton is by no means simply solved by economic problems.

The second method to resolve the shortage of raw materials and fuel is to expand imports from abroad. For example, the method of opening up goods that have been paid for recently announced by the Executive Yuan is one of the specific steps. It is estimated that if this method can take effect, then goods worth 50 million US dollars left in Hong Kong can be imported, which will help alleviate the shortage of raw materials. However, according to news from the financial community, whether the self-prepared foreign exchange goods left in Hong Kong can be imported depends on whether the domestic financial situation becomes more balanced. Obviously, if the imported raw materials must face the risk of being purchased at a price limit, then the so-called partial opening of self-prepared foreign plants is still not very strong. As for the expansion of fuel imports, it seems that the authorities are also trying to find ways. According to the report of the director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, the municipal finance authorities have agreed with the Central Bank to entrust the Central Trust Bureau to order 50,000 tons of foreign coal to solve the problem of coal for public utilities in many seasons. However, this method must not be regarded as the government's preparation to subsidize public utilities, because when the Industry Group of the Commodity Regulation Committee held a meeting last Wednesday, the representatives attending the Central Bank stated that the authorities lacked foreign exchange for importing industrial raw materials. Therefore, the Supervisory Office plans to allocate 20 million US dollars in foreign exchange for the China Trust Bureau to import raw materials. "The Central Bank has not received an order," etc. It can be seen that if it is believed that the government has recently received a lot of gold, silver, and foreign exchange, so it can be used for the import of raw materials, it is obviously a too naive idea.

The third method to resolve the shortage of raw materials and fuel is only for the industrial and commercial circles to "rely on their own efforts". "Wool comes from the sheep's back," which is also the easiest way. Therefore, the result of the meeting of the Industry Group of the Commodity Regulation Committee last Thursday was to decide that the raw materials needed for rubber and papermaking should be preferentially supplied to the rubber and papermaking industries based on the quantity of goods reported by the commercial firms in this city. By analogy, especially for raw materials that are slightly processed, the government will probably adopt the method of "getting it from the left hand and taking it away from the right hand" on a large scale, acting as an "introducer" for various industries. However, the problem has not been thoroughly resolved. Relying solely on this method to deal with the shortage of raw materials and fuel, the panic will still come. In a helpless situation, the thrift movement will inevitably be proposed. For example, taking coal as an example, according to the Dagong News Agency, the authorities are planning to implement a more stringent coal-saving campaign, asking citizens to restrain the use of coal for heating, and prohibiting the use of hot water heaters in large buildings, offices, public places, dance halls, theaters, etc. Naturally, just like not allowing meat on Tuesdays, this is just the beginning. Winter—an extraordinary winter, it seems that more than five million citizens will have to grit their teeth and endure the torment of hunger and cold!

### Various Provinces Increase the Number of Universities; Order Issued to Stop Requests to Change to National Status; Boycotts and Petitions to Protect Schools are Extremely Harmful

[Special Dispatch from the Masses News Agency] The Ministry of Education recently noted that in recent years, various provincial governments and public opinion organizations, often disregarding the financial resources of their respective provinces, have requested to increase the number of higher education institutions under the guise of promoting education and cultivating talent, as well as providing relief to unemployed youth. Once the Ministry of Education approves their proposal, they then request to change the institution to national status, without considering the true purpose. Consequently, staff and students rise up in protest, even boycotting classes and petitioning to protect the school. This has become a common practice, which is extremely harmful.

Professor Yan Renguang lectured on "Currency System Reform," President Zhu Kezhen lectured on "The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)," former President of National Chung Cheng University Hu Xian lectured on "The Meaning of Life," and President of Peking University Hu Shih lectured on "Liberalism and China."

In the clear and crisp autumn weather, construction is booming on campus. The Cunzhong Hall has been renovated, and toilets and washrooms are being added.

Amidst the "selling white rice as black rice" scandal, public funds are still limited to the "August 19th" price limit of 8.34 yuan. Vegetables are without oil, and there is only sand in the rice.

Two boxes of new American records have been shipped to the school and will be released soon.

Students "do not forget sports while studying." The number of participants in the sports group's Chinese martial arts class is extremely enthusiastic.

The "New Student Welcome Party" and "New Student Entertainment" started at the beginning of the month and have not ended yet. It has a "renewal upon renewal" feel. (Ling Feng)

### The Large Pancake and Other Things

— Lei Ting

Because of thrift and economic limitations, the large pancake and fried dough sticks have become my main breakfast every day. But when I went to buy it as usual this morning, I couldn't buy it. When asked why, the answer was: there is no flour, so it cannot be made. Judging from the situation, the pancake stall owner didn't seem to be lying, so I had to return home disappointed.

Because I was a little disappointed, I thought of unpleasant things. Also, because this disappointment happened because I couldn't buy a large pancake, I also thought of the news I accidentally saw a few days ago that a certain pancake stall owner committed suicide because he couldn't buy flour, couldn't do business, and his wife was sick. (I have forgotten the name and location, because at that time I still had large pancakes to eat, so I "regarded it indifferently"; fortunately, it was not important.)

This news was of course just a very small headline, printed in the corner of the newspaper. Naturally, not many people paid attention to it, and those who saw it didn't take it seriously. But now, because it is a bit related to myself, I not only don't have the fluttering feeling I had when I read the newspaper at that time, but also think that this problem is a bit serious, although the reason why this problem is serious is still my own feeling.

In fact, from a distance and a big picture, isn't this a serious social problem!

The suicide of a certain pancake stall owner was motivated by "his wife's illness." However, the word "again" immediately follows the previous sentence "unable to do business." Therefore, if there "was" flour and he "could" do business, even if "his wife" was ill, the owner would not have committed suicide. It is obvious. Based on this, the suicide of the owner was of course because he was unable to do business.

Unable to do business is the same as being unemployed. The inability to operate a pancake stall affects only the owner, since the scale is small and doesn't necessarily employ workers, and only affects people like me who eat large pancakes. It is natural to want to hum a line of "the people are exhausted" to vent a little bit of complaint.

However, if the scope of inability to operate expands, the problem will not be so simple. Watching with a cold eye, this trend does not seem to be impossible to realize.

Now, the large and small shops in this city can be said to be bustling with customers, but aren't the goods displayed very few? Hoarding is certainly one reason for this phenomenon, but I always suspect that in addition to hoarding, some people are also hiding. Customers are hoarding, and owners are hiding, and the latter are hoarding more fiercely than the former. Because of the simultaneous "hoarding," many shops have become monsters with gaping mouths.

For example, before the tax increase, cigarettes were in short supply everywhere. Once the price was adjusted, goods immediately "poured in" and everything was available. But in the past few days, they have been in short supply everywhere again. The result of the authorities' investigation is that manufacturers and wholesalers are shrugging off responsibility? Taking one example as a lesson, I suspect that many commodities are being manipulated so that they "cannot be operated."

If this kind of "inability to operate" expands, there will definitely be people who will make a fortune from "inability" (because we had war fortunes and victory fortunes in the past, so now we might as well invent the name "inability fortune" to form a three-legged situation, which is quite grand). However, these "people" are only a minority. The majority of salaried people will probably be unemployed due to the pretense of inability to operate by a few bosses, which will further turn into unwillingness to operate, and then a complete closure. This is not as simple as the inability of a pancake stall to operate.

If, unfortunately, this large group of unemployed people increases in the future, what will happen?

Because I didn't get to eat a large pancake for a day, I said a lot of nonsense above, which inevitably makes the carefree people of the optimistic school see me as "hysterical," and I am very willing that this is my own "hysteria." Because if it's just my own "hysteria," only I will feel panic. A杞人憂天 person is worried about everything, and it is all self-inflicted suffering!

As the saying goes: A single spark can start a prairie fire. I hope that the inability of the pancake stall to operate is just a very short-term accidental bubble, not only not a single spark, but not even fire at all.

### Lining Up

— Tong Tuo

I have experienced a severe test of lining up once in my life, when I took the train back to my hometown during the enemy-puppet period. At that time, to buy a train ticket, you had to ask someone you knew for help and offer a price several times higher than the ticket price to get it. Of course, if you took this ticket and wanted to get on the train, you had to line up to pass through the ticket gate. At that time, braving the cold wind of December, I rushed to the station early in the morning and saw a long line like a copper wall. I squeezed in at the end of the line. In less than five minutes, I looked back and saw a lot of people squeezing behind me.

At this time, the ticket gate had not yet started working. The long line was getting tighter and tighter, pushing and shoving, and it was almost impossible to breathe comfortably. There were also shouts from the police and the threatening sound of rattan whips waving in the air—it was really uncomfortable. When I passed through the ticket gate and rushed out of the small gap, I actually squeezed out a body of sweat in the cold wind, from the inner shirt soaked with sweat to the cotton-padded jacket, with sweat beads all over my head, almost like midsummer. The most profound impression of the suffering of lining up in my life was that time, which I will never forget. The hatred for lining up also took root at that time—because this is not like lining up, it is simply a battle of life and death.

In fact, there is nothing wrong with lining up. In order to maintain order among the crowded people, there is no other way but to line up. It's just that today's world is in chaos, and lining up has become a symbol of a deteriorating situation. For example, we used to get household rice by rationed tickets and could go to buy it calmly within the specified validity period. But recently, there is no rice in the rice shops, and household rice also has to be obtained by looting, so it is inevitable to line up.

After the rice is solved, vegetables also have to be lined up, buying meat, buying fish... as long as it belongs to meat, you have to line up. Housewives have to line up in order to solve the day's meals. It is true that one bowl of porridge and one meal should be thought of as hard-won. Lowering the standard, even buying jewelry lottery tickets also requires lining up and looting, which shows how people's lives are in a state of panic today!

Since lining up is无可厚非, we have to choose among them. Why follow the crowd and spend our lives lining up everywhere? For example, those who have no food at home need to line up for household rice, but if they don't eat fish and meat, they still have vegetables. Why wait from dawn until sunset for a pound of meat and a fish? The top prize of the jewelry lottery ticket is indeed enviable, but thinking of the one in 600,000 chance, I feel that it is a waste of life to line up to buy a lottery ticket. I don't think this argument will affect the sales of lottery tickets, because as of the time I am writing, I heard that the lottery tickets have been sold out.

I would rather waste the effort of meaningless lining up to exercise, because many lining up results are futile. Once I saw a couple going to the cinema to line up to buy movie tickets. When it was their turn to reach the window, a sign had already been hung out saying "Tickets are sold out, please come early tomorrow." The couple had to return in disappointment. Don't you think this kind of lining up is disappointing?

### Talking About Wine

— Old Man Semi-Dream

In order to increase luxury goods taxes, the government first increased the taxes on cigarettes and alcohol by more than 70%, so cigarettes and alcohol were allowed to increase in price by more than double, breaking the August 19th fixed price. Cigarettes and alcohol are both stimulating and contain slight toxins, but many people are addicted to them and unconsciously fall into their trap and cannot extricate themselves. Cigarettes are not discussed here. As for alcohol, the ancients called it "掃愁帶" [belt to sweep away sorrow] and "釣詩鈎" [hook to fish for poetry]. Ordinary people use alcohol as a "belt to sweep away sorrow," while writers use alcohol as a "hook to fish for poetry." Li Bai's hundred poems with a斗 [unit of dry measure] of alcohol is a representative of a poet who "fishes for poetry."

The weather is gradually getting colder, and alcohol is gradually raising its head. Although the price of alcohol has doubled, those who indulge in drinking do not feel it at all. There is a liquor store near me that sells all kinds of wines, such as rose wine, Wujiapi wine, grape wine, Buddha's hand wine, bayberry wine, old wine and new wine, Huadiao wine and Taidiao wine, and also all kinds of foreign wines, with colorful advertising paper stuck on black bottles, displayed in glass cabinets, which is very beautiful. Many drinkers can't help but salivate when they pass by. If they have money on them, they pour a glass on the counter and start to taste it while standing. After one glass is finished, they come for another glass, no matter if their face is red and their heart is fluttering, as if the country and the world have nothing to do with them. Even if they come out and fall on the side of the road, it doesn't matter, anyway, bury me on the spot. The ancients also had precedents, so what's wrong with following the example? They also say that living in this era is meaningless. We can't be corrupt, and there is no way to get rich. No one praises us for being honest all our lives. It's all the same to live drunk and dream of death, and to die drunk and dream of life. I often see people like this. When they are drunk, I go over and talk to them. There are foreigners and Chinese. I don't understand foreign languages, but if the Chinese are old, they often have a kind of experience and deep sorrow. Digging it up is really full of emotion.

Therefore, he uses alcohol as a "belt to sweep away sorrow," and I can't help but use the words of the drinker as my "hook to fish for poetry." My friend Mu Jushi said: "Half is poetry crazy and half is alcohol crazy, one song and one toast, both eliminating cold and avoiding heat are as desired, drunk and high-pitched chanting has a different heart." He also said: "Sometimes having alcohol is not a good plan, having alcohol without poetry is also boring, poetry comes from nature and is written drunk, alcohol meets friendship and pours out feelings." I said: "Who knows Li Bai's madness throughout the ages, a hundred poems with a斗 of alcohol holding a pot, using poetry as a side dish to add flavor to poetry, talking about poetry with alcohol to moisten the intestines. Du Mu climbed the tower and drank more, Tao Qian supported his staff and forgot each other in drunkenness. Let the earth be turned upside down, one song is full of brocade bags." After all, it's a bit sour, so I'll stop writing here.

### Talking About Fengqiao

— Hou Xi

Many famous places give us a more lovely impression from the words that have been passed down than the actual scenery. Often, when you are there, you feel that there is nothing to be gained, and you can't help but secretly blame the predecessors for being too good at using words to exaggerate so well. Like "Hanshan Temple outside Gusu City," how beautiful is the scene conveyed to us from Zhang Ji's poem "Night Mooring at Fengqiao" from the Tang Dynasty! There are many people who admire it and go there, but 19 out of 10 think it is not worth a visit, and only get a rubbing of Zhang Ji's poem stele and return.

In fact, Zhang Ji's poem title is "Night Mooring at Fengqiao," which describes the surrounding scenery and reveals the inner emotions, not the Hanshan Temple. When the moon has set, the birds are crowing, and the frost is all over the sky, facing the maple forest and fishing lights, unable to sleep with sorrow, the temple bell reaches the pillow, and a quiet chant is formed. The feeling of being a guest permeates the bones of the poem, and only the two words "sorrowful sleep" wake up the whole poem. When I was a child, I saw in a book that "sorrowful sleep" was interpreted as the name of a stone, which was the most peculiar. Some people also pointed out that there was no bell ringing in the middle of the night, and others came out to give examples to refute, which also felt very tasteless.

A poet captures the emotion of a moment and a place to complete a creation. We understand and interpret it from different angles, only seeking to be not far away, so why bother to wear凿附会! The scenes and artistic conception expressed in Zhang Ji's poem, as well as the rhythm and color of the poem, can give us a kind of infection. It is also a knowing appreciation for those who admire Hanshan Temple because of this poem. As for returning in disappointment, then blame yourself for being too stubborn and not blaming the Tang Dynasty for doing a tourist advertising poem for the monks of Hanshan Temple. Moreover, going to the temple to visit the stele in a superficial way will certainly not get any good results. Even if you hire a boat and support it to Fengqiao for the night, although it is the time of frost, I am afraid that you may not be able to practice the artistic conception of the poem, and as a result, it is most likely that you will win a sleepless night.

I remember in the autumn of the 15th year, I had something to do and went to Suzhou by water. The boat passed Fengqiao, and I pushed the cabin to look at it. There were wild bushes, weeds, and the setting sun was in a mess. The water was sad, and the bridge was silent. I made a special trip to the shore to see Hanshan Temple to relieve my depression, but I didn't write a poem. Perhaps the sense of oppression that "Cui Hao wrote a poem on top" was not without reason. When I settled in Suzhou, I went out several times, passed Fengqiao, went to Tianping Mountain, and also took a break at Hanshan Temple; tourists enter the temple, not to listen to the bell, but to see the bell. But the ancient bell of the Tang Dynasty was taken to Japan long ago, and its whereabouts are still being searched for.

Du Mu's poem says: "I will never forget the time of parting, the evening smoke and autumn rain pass Fengqiao." This is another Fengqiao in the writing of a Tang Dynasty person. There are many poems written by later generations, but it seems that the writing is too intentional, and there are few that are worth seeing.

Fengqiao has its own beauty, so don't hold on to the "成竹" [ready-made plan] of "the moon has set, the crows are crowing, and the frost is all over the sky" to check the poetic materials. So I still think of Fengqiao sometimes, but unfortunately I didn't moor by the bridge at night. I rushed to Hengtang that night when I passed by that year. But why do you have to moor at night? I suspect that I have also made the mistake of "carving a boat to seek a sword."

Shu Fan asks for the title of Mr. Huang Huimu's Chengni Inkstone Yao Chu

The Fen River flows with thousands of pounds of force, breaking the dragon's teeth and cutting the dragon's spine, leaving only a piece of fish yellow to match Mr.'s water pit red. The scholar stepped up for righteousness in a hurry, and the women and children in the garden rushed to the enemy. Outside the White Cloud Village, there was a lot of noise, and after nine deaths, he still had a flute around his waist. Since ancient times, loyalty and righteousness are inherent in human nature, and generosity and calmness are originally a single line. Dazhou's memorial to the stars peeks through the window, and the feather summons the soul with bamboo splitting stone. It is conceivable that when Dao Yan built the camp, he carved his liver as paper and blood as a barrier. In the evening, he stored tears and wrote about the remnant mountains. Who knew that he had drafted a declaration before the army? Three hundred years have passed since the fall of the Ming Dynasty, and the secluded light has never gone out, just like the silk bag coming out of the Chengni, which cannot be eroded by the waves. Taihang is the same body as Wan Die, and it is really virtuous to suppress the four directions. If you are allowed to pass through Guan Cheng, the Eji general can be given the title. In the past, Wu was determined to be a hero, and he ran to Youbing in despair. He lived with his mother for a generation, and the ancient appearance was only passed down with white pupils. If you want to use relics to be proud of Yuyao, try to find the old bird in Qiandun. (The abandoned shoes of Mr. Tinglin's former residence in Qiandun, Kunshan, still exist.)

### Talking About Chrysanthemums

— Hong Xian

Although chrysanthemums are talked about by elegant literati and scholars, and ordinary people who consider themselves to be hermits always praise themselves for their noble feelings by picking and appreciating chrysanthemums, in fact, the potted chrysanthemums in today's cities have long been manipulated by people and lost the old state of living in seclusion with people.

The real chrysanthemums that accompany wild people in the mountains are the yellow wild chrysanthemums in the mountains and fields. Their flower shape is small and simple, and the varieties are different. They can usually bloom from the end of summer to the end of winter, distributed from the plains to the high mountains, from the temperate zone to the cold zone. They are not only not afraid of wind and frost, but also resistant to ice and snow. Even some stubborn species can live in extremely dry barren cliffs or deserts, enduring climate differences, and struggling at any time, showing its toughness. This is the yellow flower in our ideal, and it can also represent the gentlemen who work hard silently in the dark society. It is only appropriate to praise these not very famous members of the chrysanthemum family to conform to the way of appreciating chrysanthemums today. Only those nameless yellow flowers are the real ones that decorate the autumn wilderness, making the earth more beautiful and giving the public the feeling of autumn.

In addition, I can't help but think of the pyrethrum cultivated by experts in the fields. Although they have the name of chrysanthemum, they are not only for pure appreciation, but also have the effect of removing insects. This is just like the martyrs and gentlemen who worked hard to criticize the adverse currents and eliminate the masses of ugly people in the dark period. Their being valued by experts is just like the gentlemen of the past dynasties being valued by historians. It is also thanks to him that he has the courage to prevent and eliminate pests, which invisibly reduces a lot of damage to the entire biological world. Therefore, he is not only worthy of "appreciation," but also worthy of attention and cultivation. I hereby propose this pyrethrum that matches the upright gentlemen to discuss with chrysanthemum appreciators. I wonder if he can be commented on in the future?

### Legal Q&A: Question on Redemption of Pawned House

[Question from Mr. Zhang Yangzhi] I have a house (in Shaoxing) that was pawned in the 27th year of the Republic of China for a term of ten years, which has now expired. However, the pawnee lives in Hangzhou and I do not know his detailed address. What kind of procedures should I use to obtain the property rights? Please give me an answer in your column!

[Answer from Mr. Ying Mingshi] According to Article 923 of the Civil Code: If the pawnor does not redeem the pawn at the original pawn price after two years from the expiration of the pawn term, the pawnee will obtain ownership of the pawned property. According to the question, the house was pawned in the 27th year and the ten-year term has now expired, so you must not be negligent and suffer losses. Since you know that the pawnee is in Hangzhou, you can announce the redemption; if it is still invalid, you can deposit it with the court. If you proceed according to the usual procedure, you can file a lawsuit for redemption and serve it by public announcement.
