The President, full of energy, inspected the honor guard after disembarking, and then drove with Director Yan to the Pacification Headquarters for a private conversation lasting about an hour. Afterwards, they had lunch together with Yan, Xu, Yang, and others. In the afternoon at 3:00 PM, he met with Wang Jingguo, Sun Chu, the two Commanders-in-Chief, Zhao Rong, Gao Daozhi, the two Corps Commanders, and Yin Zhou, the Brigade Commander who broke through from Linfen, along with battalion and company commanders.

Subsequently, he met with responsible persons from various party and government circles, including Hu Zuoyong, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Liang Dunhou, a member of the Provincial Government Committee, and Wang Huaiming, the Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, encouraging them to unite in spirit, assist the military, mobilize the masses, and accomplish the mission of eliminating the communist bandits. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, the President and his party left Taiyuan and flew back to the capital. It is reported that the President, concerned about the Taiyuan battle situation, originally planned to visit Taiyuan yesterday, but due to the overcast and rainy weather all day, the plane was unable to land. He waited until 3:00 PM in the afternoon before rescheduling the visit for today. The President's plane was the "Sino-American" four-engine special aircraft, which circled twice over Taiyuan at 11:30 AM this morning, causing merchants and civilians to be encouraged and elated upon hearing the news.

[Another Dispatch] When President Chiang met with responsible persons from various party and government circles in Taiyuan today, he first told them that there was absolutely no problem with the safety of Taiyuan. Although the communist bandits are very rampant, reinforcements have been continuously increased, and the defending troops are fighting bravely, and will surely defeat the invading bandit army. It is hoped that the military and civilians will cooperate sincerely under the leadership of Director Yan, strengthen their confidence, and accomplish the mission of eliminating the communist bandits. Recalling the critical situation in Shenyang this spring, which was even more serious than the current situation in Taiyuan, I once went there to encourage the military and civilians of Shenyang with the expectations I have for you comrades today, which not only turned Shenyang from danger to safety, but also dealt a major blow to the communist bandits. I am personally pleased to see everyone united and bravely resisting the bandits under unified command, and I am confident that the Jinzhong battle can be won.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] It is reported that when President Chiang visited Taiyuan, Yan Xishan expressed to the President that he was determined to do everything possible to defend Taiyuan, and believed that Taiyuan could definitely be secured. President Chiang also expressed to Yan Xishan that the central government would do its best to support Taiyuan, continue to send air force to cooperate in the battle, and send large reinforcements to Taiyuan.

Vice President Jia Jingde, who accompanied the President on the inspection of Taiyuan, met with our newspaper reporter after returning to the capital. He said that although the situation in Taiyuan is very urgent at present, the people's hearts are very stable, and Director Yan Xishan is particularly calm and composed. At present, only small groups of bandits are occasionally disturbing within forty miles of the suburbs of Taiyuan. The main force of the bandits is still being blocked by the national army outside of forty miles. The military and civilians of Taiyuan have been trained for a long time and have been fully mobilized. There are more than 3,200 solid bunkers outside the city, and the fortifications are very good. It is believed that the situation in Taiyuan will improve in two or three days. At present, what Taiyuan needs is air force to cooperate in the battle and to increase fresh troops. The central government has already implemented these measures. The problem of food supply may be slightly more difficult in the future than in the past, but the current preparations are sufficient and there is no shortage. Jia expressed optimism about the Taiyuan battle situation and praised the mobilization of the military and civilians of Taiyuan.

### The Northeast Wheat Battle is Successful, Thousands of Miles of Wheat Fields in Southern Liaoning Can Yield 60 Million Jin

[Our Shenyang Dispatch of the 22nd] In the Northeast Wheat War, the national army has achieved a victory. In the thousands of miles of wheat fields in southern Liaoning, the military and civilians are busy harvesting. It is estimated that 60 million jin can be harvested, half of which is enough for three months of military rations. In the fertile plains crisscrossed by the Liao River, Hun River, and Taizi River, the government and the military are cooperating to establish four purchasing stations in Liaozhong, Pangjiaxiang, Lengzibao, and Xiaobeihe. According to the Shenyang grain price, the wheat is purchased from the people at a fixed price of 80,000 old circulation coupons per jin. Those who do not want to sell will be issued grain coupons by the government (public transportation and public storage). Farmers, who are particularly fond of their hard-earned harvest, once requested "private transportation and private storage." After the purchasing agencies explained the situation in detail, they realized that the government's measures were to protect farmers' wheat harvest and prevent the bandits from looting, and they gladly sold or received grain coupons. Since the 19th, purchases have reached more than one million jin. Ten new American-style wheat threshers are currently working in the Northeast. From harvesting to becoming wheat grains, it takes five minutes to produce two hundred market jin. According to Guo Keti, Director of the Liaoning Construction Office, 760,000 mu of wheat are planted in the seven counties surrounding Shenyang. This year's harvest is excellent, with an estimated yield of 51,000 tons. The population of Shenyang City is one million, and the population of the seven surrounding counties is one and a half million, averaging 40 jin per person.

### The Legislative Yuan Revises the Budget Under the Ministry of Finance, Simplifies and Adjusts the Customs Agency, Summarizes Opinions on Educational Funding for Decision at Today's Meeting, the Fuel Management Committee and the Flower Management Committee are All Abolished

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] The Legislative Yuan held its fifth secret meeting on the 22nd to continue discussing the general budget. President Sun continued to request leave due to illness, and Chen Guyuan was elected as chairman. The budget under the Ministry of Finance was discussed first and passed after being revised according to the review opinions. The main points included: (1) Eliminating the budgets of the three tax management bureaus in the Northeast that have not been established. (2) The customs agency should be streamlined and adjusted by the Ministry of Finance to save waste. (3) Increasing the 1.4 trillion yuan for tax collection and business expansion was eliminated. (4) Retaining the 100 billion yuan for the preparatory expenses for the collection of property tax, and approving its use after the property tax law is passed and implemented. (5) The budgets of the local financial management bureaus are still listed as usual. According to the previous deliberations on cutting them down during the group and comprehensive reviews, the joint review rejected the proposal to cut them down, and no one raised new opinions at yesterday's meeting. Then the budget under the Ministry of Education was discussed. The review opinion was that during the current period of suppression, the military expenditure was huge. Therefore, in accordance with the constitutional provision that the central education expenditure should not be less than 15% of the total budget, only the ordinary departments were calculated and listed sufficiently. Some members raised objections, believing that the special departments were not included in the calculation, which was a violation of the constitution. As for how to use the 4.5 trillion yuan of education expenditure after making up the difference, opinions were also divided. Some advocated using it for universal basic education throughout the country, while others advocated using it to accommodate students in the pacification areas and various temporary educational facilities. As for training expenses, some also believed that they should be transferred from the education department to various agencies. However, according to the constitution, the Legislative Yuan cannot make a resolution to increase the budget and cannot make up for the educational expenses that the Executive Yuan did not list. After an hour and a half of debate, it was resolved that the sixth review group of the Budget Committee should meet with the Education and Culture Committee in the evening to study together, summarize various different opinions, and submit them to the Yuan meeting on the 23rd for decision. Then the budget under the Ministry of Education was discussed and, after an hour and a half of heated debate, it was resolved to submit it to the Education and Culture Subcommittee of the Budget Committee for re-review, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00.

The secret meeting continued at 4:30 PM to discuss the general budget. The parts under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice and Administration and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry were passed without objection according to the review opinions. The budget of the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice and Administration and its subordinate agencies was temporarily retained and will be reviewed after its organizational law is determined. For the budget of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, some members advocated overturning the resolution passed by the joint meeting to abolish the fuel management committee, flower management committee, and industry and commerce guidance office under the ministry. After debate, the voting results were: (1) The fuel management committee and fuel management measures were still abolished. During the transition period, the fuel management business will be handled by the ministry in conjunction with the Resource Committee and the Coal Industry Association. (2) The flower management committee and the industry and commerce guidance office were also abolished. Later, a temporary motion was discussed regarding the Wang Zhibin drug trafficking case (this news is published on page 4).

### Hong Kong Anti-Japanese Industrial Revival Association: Open Letter to the American People

Urging Prevention of Erroneous US Policy

[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 22nd] A recently established Anti-Japanese Industrial Revival Association here today issued an open letter to the American people, believing that advocating the restoration of Japan's economic strength, thereby restoring its military power to engage in aggression, is an erroneous policy of the US government. They urged the American people to prevent it. The wording in the letter was exceptionally peaceful, stating that they, like the American people, do not believe that Japan will quickly become a peace-loving democratic country. It also stated that rebuilding Japan as an anti-communist fortress will promote its aggression. Japan often uses anti-communism as a pretext to carry out its aggression, and there is no guarantee that this will not happen again, avoiding the suffering of both China and the United States.

### Yangtze River Floods and Water Conservancy Construction

Since April this year, the water level of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has suddenly risen, breaking historical records. In previous years, flood control work along the Yangtze River started around June 15th, but this year it was破early, starting on May 15th. The water level in Hankou was "22.821" on May 15th, exceeding the water level of the same period in 1931; by July 18th, the water level continued to rise to "26.36",比lower than the water level of the same period during the 1931 major flood by 1.92 meters. Hankou is the source of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, where hundreds of rivers converge, so the rise and fall of the water level in Hankou has become the indicator of the height of the Yangtze River's flow. Currently, heavy rains in Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces have caused disasters, and the water flow in the lake area has a tendency to overflow. The water levels in Chongqing and the Three Gorges are rising sharply every day, and ships traveling up and down are all docked in Yichang, not daring to risk going west. In Hunan, more than ten counties around Dongting Lake have seen their embankments collapse, and the former granary has become a reservoir. The people along the lake are trapped in the water, and their future survival is uncertain. If such a dangerous situation is not rescued as soon as possible, the harm to farmland in the provinces along the Yangtze River and the impact on the lives of millions of people will be immeasurable.

The Yangtze River, also known as the Yangzi River, is a major tributary collected from thousands of streams and rivers in Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and other provinces. It rises from the plateau and flows towards the sea. Geographically and economically, it is crucial for the survival and prosperity of the people on both sides of the river. Although the Yangtze River flows for thousands of miles, its source and destination are clear and smooth, unlike the muddy Yellow River. The waters of the Yangtze River rarely break through embankments and cause disasters, harming the people, so historians and poets of all dynasties praised the Yangtze River as a clear stream rather than a source of disaster. The major flood in 1931 created an unprecedented catastrophe in the three towns of Wuhan, an unfortunate page in the history of the Yangtze River. However, the cause of the 1931 flood was due more to human negligence than natural factors. Due to the unprecedented lessons of the 1931 flood, the National Government actively sought water conservancy, paying attention to building embankments and flood prevention. Local governments in various provinces also began small-scale water conservancy facilities, dredging water sources and rivers, and achieved great results over the past ten years. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, most provinces along the river fell into enemy hands. Under the Japanese invaders' policy of "destruction without construction," even some passive embankment and flood prevention work was abandoned and neglected. Therefore, in the three years after the victory and restoration, floods occurred along the rivers and lakes of the Yangtze River from time to time. There are two reasons for the rise in the water level of the Yangtze River this year and the current disasters in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces: (1) Due to the sudden high water level during the winter peach blossom flood and frequent heavy rains after April this year, the water level along the river rose sharply; (2) The early arrival of the flood season in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River by a month is purely a natural factor. As for the major floods around Dongting Lake, they are due to the fact that embankments, ditches and canals have been in disrepair for a long time due to the eight-year Anti-Japanese War, and now they have unfortunately suffered natural persecution, resulting in the flooding of the earth and the formation of today's disaster.

Having understood the importance of the Yangtze River and the causes of the flood, we should discuss the ways and methods of water conservancy administration. In modern countries, there are three ways to manage river affairs: (1) Dredge rivers to avoid floods; (2) Organize waterways to facilitate transportation; (3) Develop water conservancy to promote industry. The US TVA plan has turned the "American Yellow River," which often flooded and destroyed houses and soil, into a blessing for the people. All countries in the world are shocked by the greatness of its engineering and its functions. The success of the US TVA plan is the highest degree of efficiency in water conservancy administration measures; in a passive sense, it avoids floods and facilitates shipping, and in a more active sense, it exerts power and promotes industry. This type of measure with far-reaching construction significance is not only needed by capitalist countries, but also urgently needed by agricultural countries on the path to industrialization. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, our government originally wanted to implement the TVA plan on the Yangtze River and the Qiantang River, and obtained the support of American engineers to design the Three Gorges Reservoir plan. Unfortunately, this great project was shelved halfway, which is regrettable. The Three Gorges Reservoir construction plan is as important as the Tanggu port construction and the Huangpu port construction. If we consider the significance of preventing floods, the construction of the Three Gorges Reservoir will benefit the people of the provinces along the Yangtze River even more greatly than the Tanggu and Huangpu port construction projects. Now, floods are occurring along the Yangtze River, and the situation is dangerous. From the active point of view of governing river affairs, we advocate the restoration of the Three Gorges Reservoir project, which is a measure to fundamentally eliminate floods and develop industrial power to build the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. From the passive point of view of governing river affairs, water conservancy authorities and local governments, engineers and the people along the river should learn the spirit of blocking the breach and closing the gap at the Huayuankou of the Yellow River, use their wisdom and manpower to quickly carry out rescue and close the gaps, and eliminate disasters.

The current floods on the Yangtze River are affecting the upper reaches and the Xiang and Han rivers. The seriousness of the situation is like the eve of the closing of the gap at the Huayuankou of the Yellow River last year. If a major disaster occurs, the chaos will be even greater than the Wuhan flood of 1931, which is what we must first be vigilant about. Currently, flood control work has begun in the provinces along the river, but the rescue work is not being done well enough, and the mobilization of the people is also insufficient, causing excessive panic among the residents along the river. In short, rescuing and blocking the breach is an urgent action. One must not have the mentality of "leaving it to fate" and thinking that it is impossible to control. The government and the people, engineering and planning, must have the spirit of reversing the universe in order to overcome nature. We are concerned about the current floods on the Yangtze River, so we call on the local governments of the provinces along the river to quickly mobilize the people and, with the courageous spirit of the Yellow River closure, actively begin rescue and flood prevention work to eliminate the potential for major disasters that may occur during the early flood season on the Yangtze River, in order to celebrate peace and tranquility.

In conclusion, the waters of the Yangtze River are as clear as a mirror, and it is not a source of chaos, nor is it a poisonous snake or beast that harms the people; its vastness and flowing waters must have a clear and smooth return, as long as it is effectively guided by human power, and not allowed to change naturally, flowing east when decided to the east, and flowing west when decided to the west, then the waters of the Yangtze River, which benefit the people and facilitate transportation, will be a smooth road in the human world.

### Macau Miss Aircraft Accident: Rumored to be Due to Aerial Robbery

[Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 22nd] According to Hong Kong news, the cause of the accident of the Hong Kong-Macau route airliner "Macau Miss" is very suspicious. Because the aircraft is a twin-engine amphibious aircraft, and the accident occurred a few minutes after departure, if the aircraft parts were damaged, it could also descend slowly and would not crash into the sea and sink. Moreover, the weather was very good that day, and no explosion was heard when the aircraft crashed, which is different from the testimony of the only surviving passenger, Huang Yao. The Hong Kong De Chen Western Daily reported that the aircraft accident was due to someone intending to carry out an aerial robbery, and the Macau police authorities are currently investigating and researching it.

### Content of the CCP's Resolution on Yugoslavia

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The resolution of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the issue of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, dated July 10th, was broadcast by Xinhua News Agency. This agency has previously published an abstract; the full text is recorded below:

(1) The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party fully agrees with the resolution passed by the Information Bureau meeting, attended by the Communist Parties of Poland, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, the Soviet Union, France, Czechoslovakia, and Italy, regarding the issue of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Holding this meeting and passing this resolution is the duty of international communists to defend the principles of Marxism-Leninism and to defend the revolutionary cause of the working class and the people of all countries. It is their duty to defend the cause of world peace and democracy and to protect the people of Yugoslavia from the deception and aggression of American imperialism.

(2) The leadership group of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, represented by "Tito," "Kardel," "Djilas," and "Ranković," violated the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism in their treacherous and erroneous actions, both domestic and foreign. These violations include the principled differences between socialist and capitalist countries, the necessity and importance of international aid for revolutionary movements in various countries, the class struggle and the leading role of the bourgeoisie in the people's revolutionary cause, the party as the highest organizational form of the class, and the role of democratic centralism and internal criticism and self-criticism within the party. Consequently, they have fallen into the mire of bourgeois nationalism and bourgeois political parties. The Tito group, because it implements anti-Marxist-Leninist domestic and foreign policies, because it has adopted an anti-Soviet stance, suppressed internal party criticism, refused fraternal criticism from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and five other Communist Parties, refused to participate in the Information Bureau meeting, and continues to suppress correct opinions within and outside the Yugoslav party after the publication of the Information Bureau's resolution, and continues to be hostile to international communism, has seriously damaged the cause of the people of Yugoslavia and made the enemies of Yugoslavia rejoice. The Chinese Communist Party earnestly hopes that internationalist elements within the Communist Party of Yugoslavia will resolutely rise up to correct the mistakes of the Tito group and bring the Communist Party of Yugoslavia back onto the path of Marxism-Leninism and the path of proletarian internationalism.

(3) The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that the events that have occurred within the Yugoslav party are not accidental or isolated phenomena. They are a reflection of the class struggle within the ranks of the proletarian revolution. As long as countries with classes exist, opportunists with bourgeois counter-revolutionary viewpoints will always attempt to infiltrate the revolutionary ranks of the proletariat and the Communist Party, attempting to use opportunities to undermine the revolutionary cause from within. This situation has occurred many times in the international communist movement. Within the Chinese Communist Party, it has manifested as Chen Duxiuism and Zhang Guotaoism. This situation requires communists to strive to raise their awareness and strengthen the education in Marxist-Leninist theory, in order to timely identify and oppose these bourgeois elements and protect the cause of the proletariat and the people from destruction and loss, and protect the ideological and political purity of the Communist Party.

For this purpose, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided that all party cadres should conscientiously study the resolution of the Communist Information Bureau meeting on the issue of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, in order to strengthen the education within the party on the spirit of class-based, party-based, internationalist self-criticism and discipline.

### For Aid to China to Succeed, Self-Help by the Chinese People is Crucial: Mr. Lapham's Broadcast Speech in Nanjing Last Night

[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, 22nd] Mr. Lapham, Director of the China Mission of the Economic Cooperation Administration of the United States, broadcast a speech entitled "The Mission of the Economic Cooperation Administration in China" on the American Military Advisory Group radio station in Nanjing at 7:15 PM on July 22nd. Mr. Lapham first stated that his speech was mainly addressed to the American expatriate community in China.

Mr. Lapham believes that China's current situation is undoubtedly more difficult and different than that of any other country receiving American aid. Mr. Lapham said: "Currently, we propose to use $70 million to purchase food urgently needed by the Chinese people, and $70 million to purchase raw cotton, so that the proceeds from the sale of the manufactured yarn and cloth can be used to purchase other manufactured goods or exchange for other commodities. We also propose to use $50 million to purchase petroleum products - to provide power to yarn mills and industries that need power - to provide gasoline to China's buses, trucks, and commercial aircraft, and other major public utilities that rely on petroleum products. We propose to use $13 million to purchase fertilizers to increase food production. We propose to grant or lend China $70 million to purchase parts - to restore machinery and equipment - or to build factories, expand production, and assist China in improving its transportation infrastructure. The China Mission of the US Aid also has another task, which is to fund the Rural Reconstruction Committee, which will be established jointly by China and the United States. The purpose of this committee is to provide long-term assistance to rural areas - helping farmers develop better farming methods and promoting higher living standards. A portion of all our funds will be allocated to the expenses of this committee; the exact amount has not yet been determined."

"The China Mission is currently discussing with the Chinese government what policies should be adopted to sell the food, cotton, fertilizer, and petroleum products that we supply on the Chinese market. Colleagues of the Mission firmly believe that the majority of these goods should be sold at what we call realistic prices - that is, prices sufficient to reflect the cost when they land in China. The Chinese currency proceeds from the sale of goods will be kept separately, and their use will be determined through consultation between the Chinese government and the Economic Cooperation Administration. A portion of the Chinese currency revenue will be used to fund the expenses of our program implementation in China."

Mr. Lapham reiterated: "My six weeks here have made me aware of the difficulties facing this Mission - I am well aware that we will be blamed for many of the policies adopted by the Mission. This blame may or may not be justified; however, our responsibility is undeniable. All we can do is use our best judgment at all times to cope with any circumstances. But there is another responsibility that the Chinese people should be aware of, namely that unless the Chinese people are determined to fully help themselves, this program or any other program cannot succeed in aiding China. Self-help must be utilized in every possible way. If we want this program to truly and permanently benefit the Chinese people, full cooperation is essential. It is no exaggeration to say that if China hopes that our country will pass increased American aid next year, then China must automatically engage in more self-help work than it is currently doing. China has a problem of currency inflation - this is a mild way of putting it - but my impression is that the Chinese government is failing to collect the taxes it should be collecting because the Chinese people are paying too little for the goods and services obtained through foreign exchange. There is a view that has been verified in many ways, namely that Chinese farmers are actually subsidizing large cities; and there are many people in the large cities who can pay more taxes now to cover national expenses. For example, at a cost equivalent to one or two US dollars, one can fly from Shanghai to Nanjing. Travelers who use air transport, which relies on foreign exchange for a large part of its operating expenses, can and should pay far more than this. In the United States, traveling such a distance would cost at least five times as much. It seems reasonable to limit the gasoline used for sightseeing. Gasoline is obtained through foreign exchange; why not set a realistic price for it, and why not restrict sightseeing trips in accordance with the practices of European countries? In addition, there are many other measures that can make up for the shortfall in China's budget. Why not adopt a strong self-help plan to study and implement these measures?"

Mr. Lapham also emphasized: "The Chinese people are a great nation with centuries of cultural background and a spirit of hard work and endurance. The Chinese people and the American people have many things in common. We both love individual freedom, we both like to have a relaxed adjustment in daily life, and we both do not want to be controlled by others. However, both the Chinese and American people must remember that we are living in a rapidly changing era. To strive for protection in the current turbulent world, we cannot stand idly by."

Before concluding his speech, Mr. Lapham reiterated: "If the United States is to continue the Marshall Plan to help China and other countries, both sides must have a willingness to help each other. This willingness must be expressed mutually, not unilaterally." Mr. Lapham said, "I know that when I say that the United States is willing to continue to help China, I am actually speaking on behalf of my superior, Mr. Hoffman, the administrator of the Economic Cooperation Administration; but if we are going to continue to help China, then Mr. Hoffman and I must be able to assure Congress this winter - the only body that can approve continued aid - that the people of China, the central government of China, and the provincial and municipal governments are all striving to make full use of the money of American taxpayers."

### Marshall-Clay Talks: Draft of New Three-Power Note Completed; To Be Submitted to the Soviet Union After French Cabinet Agrees; Truman Tells Reporters that Prospects for World Peace are Bright

[United Press, London, 22nd] British officials stated today that the United States, Britain, and France have tentatively agreed on a new note to the Soviet Union. Its content is intended to expand the scope of negotiations to include several German issues in addition to the Berlin situation, as a gesture of goodwill towards the Soviet Union, but the lifting of the Berlin blockade remains a prerequisite. This prerequisite is firmly insisted upon by the US side.

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] President Truman stated at a press conference on the 22nd that the prospects for world peace are unusually bright. He also said that he does not intend to mention the Berlin crisis and the international situation in the message he will submit to the special session of Congress next Tuesday. The President met with Secretary of State Marshall and Lieutenant General Clay, the US Military Governor of Germany, on the afternoon of the 22nd.

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] Secretary of State Marshall has begun important talks on the Berlin crisis with General Clay, the US military government official who has just returned to the US from Germany. Washington officials, in view of the great attention paid to these talks by all parties, specifically urged American and foreign journalists in advance not to make sensational reports on the Berlin situation. In London, Prime Minister Attlee also convened the Cabinet to review the international situation and the Berlin crisis at 10 Downing Street. Foreign Secretary Bevin reported on the proceedings of the Hague Western European Union Consultative Committee meeting and the content of the three powers' draft reply to the Soviet note. British Imperial Chief of Staff Field Marshal Montgomery arrived at the Prime Minister's residence before the Cabinet meeting and also participated in the meeting. The new note from the Western Three Powers to the Soviet Union can be submitted once the new French Cabinet is formed and agrees to the content of the note. External spokespersons admitted that it is feared that it will not be possible to deliver it before the weekend.

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] The Soviet Union suggested today that coal, electricity, raw materials, and food be supplied to the western sector of Berlin. Berlin Communist leader Mader stated at a Communist Party meeting that the Soviet Union will supply fuel and raw materials to the western sector of Berlin. He emphasized that aid to Berlin has already been launched, and there should be no factory shutdowns and no unemployment. At the same time, observers expect that the Western Allies will ignore the Soviet Union's proposal. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office in London stated that the Western powers will step up the airlift of food and coal to Berlin and will not change their policies because of the Soviet Union's proposal. At the same time, the Berlin Soviet Zone announced on Berlin radio that residents of the entire city of Berlin can collect their full rations from the Soviet Zone from August 1st. The Soviet authorities previously announced that they would allocate 100,000 tons of grain for the Berlin city authorities to distribute.

### New French Cabinet Formed: Blum as Foreign Minister, Reynaud as Finance Minister

[Report from this newspaper] London broadcast on the 22nd: Reynaud, who served as Prime Minister during the war, has agreed to serve as Finance Minister in the Marie cabinet. It is also known that veteran Socialist Blum is prepared to accept the position of Foreign Minister. Reynaud's decision will give the new Prime Minister 25 votes from the right-wing Independent Republican Party in parliament, and Blum's acceptance of the position of Foreign Minister can win Marie 103 votes.

[United Press, Paris, 22nd] The work of forming a cabinet by new French Prime Minister Marie has been hindered due to the fundamental political positions of the Socialist Party and its Radical Socialist Party. Marie held continuous talks with leaders of the Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Party, and the Independent Republican Party. Leaders of the Popular Republican Party stated after the meeting that no agreement had been reached on financial plans. Socialist Party leaders Mollet, Laumaillé, and Roche all met with Marie. Mollet said, "There are more problems than candidates."

[United Press, Paris, 22nd] Radical Socialist Party leader Marie held a series of meetings on the 22nd after being appointed to form a cabinet to discuss the lineup of the new government. French political veteran Blum will replace Bidault as Foreign Minister. Marie is also considering ousting Defense Minister Teitgen from the cabinet.

Bidault has been dissatisfied with almost all political circles since signing the London Six-Power Agreement, especially the Popular Republican Party to which he belongs. When Schuman's cabinet fell, the Radical Socialist Party was criticizing Teitgen. Marie's ideal candidate for Foreign Minister also includes wartime Prime Minister Reynaud, and the two had a meeting on the evening of the 21st. Marie said that if he decides to accept President Auriol's order to form a cabinet, he will request the National Assembly to convene on the 23rd to pass his appointment. Marie plans to form a broad national coalition government that includes all parties and factions except the Communist Party. Since the 183 votes of the Communist Party will oppose Marie, Marie's cabinet will be aborted if there are another 160 opposing votes.

[United Press, Paris, 21st] President Auriol today asked right-wing Radical Socialist Party member Marie to try to form a new cabinet. Marie is fifty years old and in good health, and almost died in a Nazi concentration camp during the war. The big problem he faces is how to win over the Socialist Party in Schuman's cabinet. The party insists on government control of the economy, while the Radical Socialist Party advocates the greatest possible private economic freedom. The Socialist Party will decide tonight whether to participate in the new cabinet, depending on Marie's economic policies. At the same time, Marie declared to the Radical Socialist Party that he will continue to pursue the financial and economic propositions of Finance Minister Mayer ★. It is not easy to say how the two will be reconciled for a while.

### British Fleet Visits Japan

[Reuters, London, 21st] The Admiralty announced that the British cruisers London and Sussex, four destroyers, and one gunboat, led by Admiral Boyd of the British Pacific Fleet, left Hong Kong on the 21st for the Sea of Japan. The London is scheduled to arrive in Yokosuka on July 28th, and will visit various ports in Japan in August, returning to Hong Kong in early September.

### Dewey Issues Statement on Berlin Situation: Has Political Implications

[United Press, Pawling, New York, 22nd] Republican presidential candidate and Governor of New York Dewey declared here today that he is cooperating with the Truman administration to find ways to break the Soviet blockade of Berlin, but is trying to avoid triggering a war. My foreign policy advisor Dulles is in constant contact with Secretary of State Marshall and is constantly reporting to me on the details of the Berlin situation. The Berlin situation is indeed serious, and a slight carelessness is enough to cause a great disaster. The Republican Party is extremely concerned about it, and this matter must be handled with extreme caution. What people are most concerned about is to seek reconciliation and to honorably defend world peace.

[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] US Republican presidential candidate Dewey and losing candidate Stassen held a "friendly meeting" in Philadelphia today after competing in the convention to discuss the diplomatic crisis in Berlin and urged government officials to handle this serious situation with extreme caution. The two issued a statement after the meeting that was rather vague and contained no concrete suggestions for solving the Berlin problem, but the statement was very political. Stassen pointed out after the meeting that the Berlin problem was originally caused by Truman and Stalin during the Potsdam Conference, so the intention of the above statement is obvious.

### China National Aviation Corporation Plane to Make Second "Technical Landing" in Tokyo

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] The China National Aviation Corporation's US-China route plane will make a second "technical landing" on the 24th after making its first "technical landing" on the 7th of this month. Negotiations on the final agreement are currently underway between the Chinese and American governments in Nanjing and Washington.

### Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito Emphasizes Willingness to Maintain Friendship with the Soviet Union and Refutes Accusations by the Communist Information Bureau

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 21st] Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito delivered a speech at the Yugoslav Communist Party Congress tonight, which lasted eight hours. Tito emphasized that the Yugoslav Communist Party is willing to do its best to improve relations with the Soviet Communist Party and refuted the accusations made by the Communist Information Bureau against the Yugoslav Communist Party, saying that the Yugoslav Communist Party will resolutely resist anyone who endangers the unity of the Communist Party and engages in division at all costs. The Yugoslav Communist Party has always been loyal to Marxism-Leninism and fully supports Soviet foreign policy. He hopes that the Bolshevik Party of the Soviet Union can find out the truth, that the Yugoslav Communist Party has never ignored Stalin's teachings.

Soviet visitors attended today's conference, but non-Communist visitors were not allowed to listen. At the opening in the morning, 2,344 representatives and everyone in the audience stood up and sang the Internationale, then observed a few minutes of silence to commemorate the martyrs who died in fascism. Then, the conference unanimously elected 29 members of the Executive Committee, including Prime Minister Tito, Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj, Minister of the Interior Ranković, and Minister without Portfolio Djilas. These people have all been condemned by the Communist Information Bureau. The conference is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss the report.

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 22nd] Yugoslav Minister of the Interior and Communist Party Political Bureau Director General Ranković was warmly applauded by the entire conference today when he delivered a report on the party's organizational process at the Yugoslav Communist Party Congress. Ranković said that the Yugoslav Communist Party was on the verge of extinction when the Central Committee, which was not under Tito's guidance, was established in 1937. According to reports in Belgrade newspapers today, representatives from party departments at all levels in Yugoslavia unanimously protested the condemnation of the Communist Information Bureau and demanded that Tito, Ranković, Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj, and Minister without Portfolio Djilas be elected as members of the current Central Executive Committee. When the conference continued this morning, representatives received congratulatory messages from all aspects of the National Front, the Army, and the Association.

### Australian Foreign Minister Flies to Britain to Attend UN General Assembly

[Reuters, Sydney, 22nd] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt flew to Britain today for talks with the British Cabinet. Before his departure, he made a speech stating that the upcoming UN General Assembly in Paris in September may be a turning point in world history. He stated that peace in East Asia depends on achieving peace in Asia, so Australia, for its own security, also deeply hopes for stability in Europe, especially in Germany, and hopes that this General Assembly can resolve the long-delayed peace treaty issues in Asia and Europe. Evatt continued, "This time I am going to Britain to discuss the issue of consolidating imperial defense with the British government, because the stability of the British Empire is also of great importance to world peace." Evatt will return to Australia after attending the UN General Assembly in Europe this time.

### Soviet Union Intensifies Control Over Czechoslovakia: 1,700 Czech Military Officers Purged; Soviet Union Uses German War Prisoners to Exploit Southern Czech Republic

[United Press, Washington, 1st] US government officials are carefully studying reports from Czechoslovakia that indicate that this Soviet-controlled country is being taken over by extremists blindly following the Kremlin. Reports indicate that the Czech government may be transferred from the hands of "moderate" Communists to Premier Zapotocky, former trade union leader, and Slansky, Secretary-General of the Czech Communist Party. US authorities believe that this change is orchestrated by the Soviet Union, which is increasingly determined to tighten control over its vassals after the "rebellion" of Yugoslav Communist Tito. Telegrams from Prague have rumors that are still in the rumor stage, and the rest have been officially confirmed and are well known.

[Central News Agency, Fort Detrick, 20th United Press] Former Czech President Beneš's military advisor Heisel recently stated that large uranium mining areas in the Czech Republic are now under the control of the Soviet Union. Heisel has now fled to Germany. It is said that there are about 7,000 German prisoners of war in the Jáchymov area of southern Czech Republic, all mining under the command of the Soviet Union. Heisel was one of the four generals who defected from Czech Republic last month. It is said that 1,700 Czech military officers have been purged, most of them replaced by Communists. It is said that 70 percent of Czech military officers at all levels are anti-Soviet.

### Large Number of United Nations Truce Observers Go to the Holy Land to Supervise the Ceasefire Agreement on Jerusalem Demarcation Line Signed by Arabs and Jews

[Reuters, London, 22nd] A large number of United Nations truce observers from the United States, France, and Belgium left Rhodes today for the various fronts in the Holy Land to carry out the task of supervising the ceasefire. Reports from Tel Aviv state that Israeli spokesmen continue to accuse Syrian and Iraqi forces of attacking in northern Palestine, but since the arrival of the ceasefire observers, the fighting has eased, and it is expected to cease completely within a few hours. A telegram from Beirut stated that Syrian, Lebanese leaders, Arab League Secretary-General Azzam, and a United Nations truce observer met there today to discuss ways to ensure the effective implementation of the ceasefire order. According to the Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs at a press conference in Jerusalem, the total casualties of the Arab forces in the Holy Land during the first ceasefire and at the beginning of the second ceasefire were 5,000, accounting for 20% of the total strength of the Arab forces in the Holy Land.

### If War Breaks Out Between Allies and Soviet Union US and Japan Will Conclude a Treaty According to the Treaty, US Will Utilize Japanese Naval and Air Bases

[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] According to senior American sources here on the 22nd, the United States will immediately sign a separate peace treaty with Japan if war breaks out between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. These sources acknowledge that Japan's geographical location is an important base in the strategic attack on the "back door" of the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify Japan's political status as the world powers realign. After signing the treaty, the United States will be allowed to use the air and naval bases currently occupied by the occupying forces.

[United Press, Washington, 21st] Senator Monk Kaser agrees with the Navy Department's plan to lease Japanese bases such as Sasebo, Kure, and Yokosuka, but Mr. Monk is on his way here and cannot be asked to comment on this today. According to the New York Daily News, Mr. McCarran will request a special parliamentary investigation into the possibility of leasing these bases for ninety-nine years, "as this move could save the United States hundreds of millions in construction costs."

### Can the Soviet Union Launch a War? (Part 1)

— Translated by Cai Jinsheng

Can the Soviet Union launch a world war? This is the first question we face today. The Soviet Union's war plan must be based on its industrial economy, just like the wrath of the United States at home. Although information about the Soviet economy is not very adequate, many basic facts are unavoidable. Let us start with the Soviet Union's population and its plans. It is wrong for the average person to think that the Soviet Union's vast territory possesses extreme wealth and ability.

The Soviet Union's territory is forty-five times larger than Germany, but more than half of its territory is forested, nearly one-fifth is desert or semi-desert, and only one-eighth is fertile. The Soviet Union has a population of 192 million, and its agricultural area is about the same size as the United States, which has a population of 142 million. Therefore, the Soviet Union's food production cannot meet the needs of an increasing population. In fact, the Soviet Union will continue to be a famine-stricken country.

Fifty million people in the Soviet Union have been displaced, resulting in losses in the vast forest areas and northern tundra regions. Therefore, the Soviet Union's population production is only as much as the United States.

Most of the Soviet Union's factories are concentrated in a triangular area west from Leningrad and Ukraine, east to the new industrial area of Siberia. This is a small part of the Soviet Union's entire territory, but it is the main source of economic development. This triangular area is very unsafe.

Currently, the Soviet Union's industrial production has not yet reached the level of the United States forty-eight years ago.

We know that Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom suffered war damage, but the Soviet Union suffered the most severely. The Soviet Union lost 58 percent of its railway vehicles, 45 percent of its steel, 44 percent of its electricity, and 55 percent of its coal production. It also lost a quarter of its livestock, millions of houses, buildings, and bridges.

At the end of the war, the Soviet Union's economic potential compared to the United States' ability fell from 42 percent to 25 percent. If the Soviet Union's reconstruction work proceeds smoothly—which it does not in reality—then it will have the same industrial productivity as the United States in 1904 (forty-four years ago) in 1951. By 1960, its production could reach the level of the United States in 1938.

On February 9, 1946, when Stalin announced the Fourth Five-Year Plan, he said: "The basic task includes restoring the pre-war eternal standard in industry and agriculture, and then exceeding this even more or less. ... To accomplish this task, perhaps three new five-year plans will be needed. But we must do this." If we carefully study these basic steps and analyze Stalin's goals, it is generally obvious, but the Soviet Union will never complete a five-year plan.

Stalin announced that the goal was to produce 60 million tons of oil in 1951, and twenty-eight years ago, free Americans had already achieved this goal. In 1947, the United States produced 270 million tons. The Soviet Union's oil supply is very poor, so it always uses coal and other fuels as much as possible.

Swedish fuel engineers have found that 30 percent of the Soviet Union's coal production is used for automobiles, and another 30 percent is used for electricity production. So, only 40 percent is left for the Soviet Union's coal-fired industry, including coal for steel. Stalin hoped that his five-year plan would produce 500 million tons of coal in 1951, and the United States already had this amount thirty years ago. Stalin requested that the new five-year plan (or next one) produce 60 million tons of steel by the end. The United States had already produced almost 50 percent before the end of World War II. The Soviet Union lacks several important strategic raw materials for launching a war—manganese, tin, antimony. Especially rubber. It has no safe transportation lines overseas to obtain rubber, and it cannot establish complete factories to produce synthetic rubber.

However, the most remarkable thing about the Soviet Union is transportation. On the surface, its ships are not overly backward. Before the war, its merchant ships had one million tons—equal to Sweden's tonnage—almost twice the size of the US lend-lease ships and the pre-war German, Italian, and Finnish reparations ships. Moreover, Japanese ships were scheduled to build 175 ships for the Soviet Union in exchange for coal and coke.

However, the Soviet Union's territory has an astonishing need for its limited domestic transportation. There are few and broken highways. The only important highway is the line from Moscow north to Leningrad, west to Minsk, and south to Kyiv and Kharkiv. In major cities, trucks are mainly used.

### Legislator Wang Zhibin Tried in Court for Drug Trafficking Legislative Yuan Sends Telegram to Shanghai Requesting Leave for Investigation People's Socialist Party Legislator Claims Wang's Relationship with the Party Is Not Deep

Wang Zhibin, a legislator elected from Rehe Province, boarded a China National Aviation Corporation "Tyrant" plane from Peiping to Shanghai at 3:40 pm on the 18th. At the airport, customs inspectors and police discovered drugs hidden in his suitcase. Wang and another suspect, Liu Runge, were detained on the spot. The police department transferred all case files and prisoners to the court at noon on the 22nd in accordance with the Special Criminal Law. At 3:00 pm, Shen Tianbao, the presiding judge of the court, opened the court for trial. Wang Zhibin was called first. According to his confession, he is a legislator elected from Rehe Province and took a plane from Peiping on the 18th to go to Nanjing to report to the Legislative Yuan and attend meetings. As for the drugs found by the police in his suitcase, they do not belong to him. He claims that a few days before leaving Peiping, his friend Xu Songjiu asked him to temporarily store the two suitcases at the home of Xu's brother-in-law in Shanghai and that Xu would come to pick them up when he arrived in Shanghai. At the time, he did not know that the suitcase contained drugs. He claimed that Xu Songjiu is from Rehe and that he met him during his election as a legislator. He is now doing business in Peiping. Finally, the defendant solemnly stated that the confession at the police station that the drugs belonged to Liu Runge was a mistake and that what he said at the police station at the time was due to temporary confusion. He also claimed that he had served under General Song Zheyuan for 20 years, obeying the law and had no transgressions. He really did not know about the drugs he was carrying this time. Then, Liu Runge testified that he went to the airport that day to pick up Wang Zhibin because there was no one at Wang's brother-in-law's house to pick him up and was asked to greet him. He also planned to ask Wang Zhibin to introduce him to a job, so he went to greet him, denying any drug trafficking. After the interrogation, the court ordered the detention of the two defendants on the grounds that they were suspected of being involved in a major case.

### Legislative Yuan Forms Two Committees to Exclude Unscrupulous Elements

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 22nd] At a secret meeting on the 22nd, the Legislative Yuan passed a temporary motion regarding the case of Wang Zhibin, a legislator from the People's Socialist Party in Rehe, transporting drugs from Peiping to Shanghai. In addition to deciding to send a telegram to the Shanghai municipal authorities requesting strict handling, it was also decided to form a "Qualifications Review Committee" and a "Discipline Committee" and to have the Legal System Committee draft organizational regulations to exclude unscrupulous elements to prevent them from disgracing the Legislative Yuan, endangering the country, and tarnishing the reputation of the Yuan. When a committee member asked the Secretariat about the handling of the reported drug trafficking by legislator Wang Zhibin, Secretary-General Zhang reported that Wang Zhibin had not yet reported to the Yuan and that the truth of the matter was unknown due to the lack of detailed reports. Zhang also read the telegram from the Shanghai Police Department to the Legislative Yuan and the Yuan's reply as follows: (1) Telegram: Urgent, To President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, Legislator Wang Zhibin boarded a plane from Peiping to Shanghai carrying ten and a half kilograms of opium, which was confiscated by customs and handed over to our bureau. Please telegraph instructions on how to handle the matter as soon as possible. Yu Shuping, Director of the Shanghai Police Department, sealed on the 19th. (2) Reply: "To Director Yu Shuping of the Shanghai Police Department: Received your telegram of the 19th. After investigation, Wang Zhibin has not yet reported to the Yuan. If there is any illegal behavior, he should bear personal criminal responsibility and can be handled according to law. The Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan, July 20." Wang Shixian, a legislator from the People's Socialist Party, also stated on the matter: "Wang Zhibin is a new member of the party, and his relationship with the party is not deep. His usual behavior is also not very clear. If it is true, he should not only be subject to legal sanctions but also be subject to party discipline."

[Our Report] Various public utility companies in the city have been greatly affected by recent price fluctuations, and after the cost-of-living index is published every half month, the companies are unable to bear the burden in the second half of each month. They have jointly requested the municipal government to allow them to adjust prices every half month. A person in charge of the Public Utilities Bureau said yesterday that the local government has no right to decide on this request because adjusting public utility prices is a national matter and must be approved by the central government. As a temporary measure, they are allowed to charge fees once every half month, but this only applies to large users. When asked about the standards for large users, it was said that there are no rigid regulations and that each company determines its own standards. In terms of tap water, those who use more than 2,000 degrees per month will be asked to pay every half month. It is estimated that there are nearly 500 large users in the city, accounting for 50% of total revenue, which is a small supplement to the company's revenue. In terms of electricity, because the situation in each power company's area is different, the standards set by each company also differ, generally targeting factories and large stores.

According to reporters, Mr. Brock, the general manager of the British Tramway Company, submitted a document to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau yesterday, stating that the company could not bear the burden after the cost-of-living index was published every half month and asked the authorities to help them borrow 200 billion yuan for emergency relief. The Public Utilities Bureau is currently considering this matter.

### Grain General Warehouse Explains the Quality of Rice for Public and Educational Employees

[Our Report] The Shanghai Grain General Warehouse yesterday sent a letter to the Public and Educational Personnel Material Supply Committee, explaining the quality of the rice supplied to public and educational employees, stating: After receiving Japonica rice in the autumn of last year, it was supplied on a monthly basis. Now that the new harvest season has not yet arrived and the Japonica rice has run out after June, Indica rice from Sichuan is being used. The ratio of 80% has been stipulated for trial milling and sealing samples, which will be sent to various manufacturers for distribution. If the quality is not different, there will be no malpractice. The warehouse is rewarding all witnesses who discover that the rice quality is not in compliance to report it at any time.

The Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office recently approved a letter from the Zhejiang High Prosecutor's Office to investigate the case of Wang Chengxiong, the deputy district chief of the Laozha District in this city, being accused of being a traitor. It is reported that Wang Chengxiong, a native of Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, is currently the deputy district chief of the Laozha District.

It is reported that the case is complex and, after questioning, he was released on bail pending further investigation.

### Counterfeit Ciba Factory Pharmaceuticals Western Medicine Merchant Detained for Investigation

[Our Report] The Shanghai Wanli Western Medicine Store's product, the expensive male hormone (Hormon) and Bilatrin, were recently proven to be counterfeit by the general factory of the Swiss businessman Ciba Pharmaceutical Factory. The police arrested Xu Zhiliang, the person in charge of the store, and transferred him to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation yesterday. According to reports, the prices of the store's products are extremely high. Fifty-three Chinese and Western pharmacies in the city all wholesale from the store. Previously, the victim, the Swiss businessman Ciba Pharmaceutical Factory in this city, discovered for the first time that the tonic was counterfeit. After reporting to the police, a large number of counterfeit products were seized at the Wuzhou Pharmacy. The Swiss businessman sent them to the general factory of the factory in Switzerland for chemical testing. Recently, the general factory received a reply telegram proving that the products were counterfeit. The Criminal Investigation Section of the police then arrested Xu Zhiliang and transferred him to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on charges of hindering industry and commerce yesterday.

Committee Formed by Council to Clear Bad Debts of Public Utilities Report Completed Huge Consumption Alarming Accounts

The Public Utilities Investigation Committee of the Municipal Council, in accordance with the six instructions issued by the Executive Yuan some time ago on handling public utility prices, yesterday compiled all the materials obtained from previous on-site inspections and produced a detailed report, which will be submitted to the authorities with specific recommendations to actively suppress and stabilize public utility prices. The report attaches great importance to the huge amount of "bad debts" owed by military and government agencies at all levels. According to the operating reports of various companies in March, this expenditure on bad debts is also an important factor in the calculation formula, with the highest reaching 24.96% of the total operating amount. Whenever adjustments are made, they are passed on to general users. The Public Utilities Investigation Committee believes that it is unfair for a small number of people to enjoy benefits while the entire city bears the burden. It has decided to ask the municipal government and the Garrison Headquarters to urge the agencies to clear the debts quickly to reduce the burden on the people. It is reported that the "bad debt expenditure" is the highest for the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company at 83,540,359,341 yuan, followed by the Shanghai Gas Company at 15,683,155,212 yuan, then the French Electric Tramway Company at 7,384,636,167 yuan, and the Huashang Electric Company at 3,634,471,131 yuan. The Shanghai Electric Power Company and others have only small amounts of arrears below 100 million yuan, and the situation is still good. As for the departments that owe the most, the military agencies are the most, followed by the police agencies under the municipal government, municipal hospitals, and universities, which also owe large amounts of money (Tongji University owes more than 4.7 billion yuan in long-term water and electricity fees). It is also learned that some agencies have never paid fees since the early days of the victory in September 1945, so the actual consumption figures are huge and the accounts are alarming.

### Examples of Labor-Management Evaluation Committee: Application of Index-Based Wage Payment Methods

[Our Newspaper Report] The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee, due to frequent labor disputes following the bi-monthly publication of the cost of living index, previously resolved to create a "Wage Calculation and Distribution Guideline" to provide a basis for both labor and management to follow. However, since the previous resolution only outlined principles, and the provisions of the "Application of Cost of Living Index for Wage Payment Methods" were not clear, disputes often arose between labor and management. Yesterday, the committee provided specific examples to clarify.

(1) For wages paid based on the cost of living index of the current month, they should be calculated and paid separately based on the index of the current period. Example: (A) Monthly wage workers: Divide the actual monthly base salary by two, multiply by the upper period index of the current month to equal the wage for the first half of the month; divide the actual monthly base salary by two, multiply by the lower period index of the current month to equal the wage for the second half of the month. (B) Piece-rate workers: Multiply the actual base salary for the first half of the month by the upper period index of the current month to equal the wage for the first half of the month; multiply the actual base salary for the second half of the month by the lower period index of the current month to equal the wage for the second half of the month. (2) For wages paid based on the cost of living index of the previous month, the current period's wages should be paid according to the previous period's index. Example: (A) Monthly wage workers: Divide the actual monthly base salary by two, multiply by the lower period index of the previous month to equal the wage for the first half of the month; divide the actual monthly base salary by two, multiply by the upper period index of the current month to equal the wage for the second half of the month. (B) Piece-rate workers: Multiply the actual base salary for the first half of the month by the lower period index of the previous month to equal the wage for the first half of the month; multiply the actual base salary for the second half of the month by the upper period index of the current month to equal the wage for the second half of the month. (3) For wages paid with half the month based on the cost of living index of the previous month and half the month based on the cost of living index of the current month, the wages for the first half of the month should be paid according to the index at the end of the previous month, and the wages for the second half of the month should be paid according to the index at the end of the current month. Example: (A) Monthly wage workers: Divide the actual monthly base salary by two, multiply by the lower period index of the previous month to equal the wage for the first half of the month; divide the actual monthly base salary by two, multiply by the lower period index of the current month to equal the wage for the second half of the month. (B) Piece-rate workers: Multiply the actual base salary for the first half of the month by the lower period index of the previous month to equal the wage for the first half of the month; multiply the actual base salary for the second half of the month by the lower period index of the current month to equal the wage for the second half of the month. (4) For wages handled in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of the Shanghai Municipality Temporary Wage Adjustment Measures, "The wages for the second half of the month are calculated uniformly by halving the method," that is, the upper and lower halves of the month each have a base of 15 yuan. For those below 15 yuan, wages are paid in full according to the index. For those above 15 yuan, in addition to the 15 yuan being paid according to the index, the remaining portion is reduced by 10% for every 5 yuan increment. For example, if the base salary for half a month of a piece-rate worker is 20 yuan, the calculation formula is (20-15) x 90 + 15 = 19.5, meaning the base salary is calculated as 19 yuan and 50 cents.

### Using Freedom of Belief as a Reason, Some People Request the Return of Stone Figures

[Our Newspaper Report] After the stone figures were removed, a group of "enthusiastic" individuals are attempting to rebuild their incense offerings. This group, led by film actor Hong Jingling, including Tang Bihua and others, and promoted by famous doctor Ding Fubao, is using the reasons of preserving "historical relics," freedom of belief, and using the proceeds from incense and candles to provide porridge, to request, through the mediation of City Councilor Zhang Zhongyuan, that the two stone figures be moved to the Fuxing Pudu Temple. Currently, their approach involves asking MGM to write to the municipal government to demand the return of the stone figures to them, and also requesting sponsorship from the City Council, which may potentially achieve their goal.

### Collapse of the Jiang堤 in Taicang, Investigation Reveals Eight Places Requiring Emergency Repairs, Residents to Guard Day and Night Before Construction

[Our Newspaper Report] Since the last typhoon passed through the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, there has been continuous rain for half a month, causing the tides to rise. The seawalls and embankments along the Yangtze River, from Baoshan to the Taicang and Changshu counties, have repeatedly reported emergencies. In particular, the 90-li Jiang堤 in Taicang County has been in disrepair for many years, and the pile stones cannot withstand the erosion. Near Daotang Temple (northeast of Taicang), the Jiang潮 once entered, and the embankment almost completely collapsed. Fortunately, the county magistrate of the county, Xue Peiqi, and the head of the construction section, Zhang Hanqing, supervised the residents and local garrison troops day and night to reinforce the堤, avoiding a breach. Upon hearing the news, the Shanghai Office of the Jiangnan Seawall Engineering Office dispatched section chief Cao Siliang to Taicang for on-site inspection on the 20th. The Su-Hu Seawall Engineering Relief Expert Committee also sent supervising engineer Guan Fuquan, secretary Zhong Huaiqing, and specialist Hou Yanpu to conduct surveys. After consulting with County Magistrate Xue, it was determined that there were eight sections of the Jiang堤 within Taicang County that urgently needed emergency repair: (1)阅兵台 (Reviewing Platform), the pile stones south of the bunker are damaged. (2) Daotang Temple, 220 meters of the pile stone project are damaged. (3) Fangjia Weir, 1.5 kilometers north of Xintang口, the embankment body is thin. (4) Minjia Residence, 269 meters of the seawall are damaged. (5) The outer slope of the Qianjing River口 (now blocked), about 1 kilometer north of Yanglin口, is 38 meters, and erosion is almost complete. (6) The original 65 meters of pile stone engineering north of Qiyakou have been completely washed away. (7) The top of the seawall south of Qiyakou has collapsed, and the fields inside the embankment have been flooded by the tide. (8) 100 meters of the east bank and 35 meters of the west bank of Qianjing口 have been destroyed by erosion. Currently, with the approach of the autumn flood, and with recent rainfall increasing, in order to actively prevent measures, it has been decided to officially establish a construction office on August 1st. The Seawall Engineering Office is responsible for the technical aspects, and the Taicang County Government is responsible for the earthwork and labor. The emergency repair funds will be allocated 40 billion from U.S. aid. The Taicang County Government has now built construction shelters near Liuhe and is starting to organize laborers. These laborers are mostly fishermen who have fled from the Yancheng area of northern Jiangsu. Currently, the fishing season has passed, and they can take this construction opportunity to solve their livelihood problems. According to County Magistrate Xue, after the seawalls in Taicang have been vigorously reinforced, if there are no strong winds or heavy rains recently, there should be no serious consequences. Currently, as the tide is still rising, orders have been issued to pay close attention along the riverbank, and residents will guard day and night before construction to prevent changes. He himself will go to the riverbank again today with Construction Section Chief Zhang to inspect and supervise.

[Our Newspaper Report] Due to a dispute over wage calculation based on the cost of living index, workers and management in the printing industry negotiated on their own yesterday.

### The Fast Train Arrives in Nanjing On Time in Five Hours

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday morning at 6:45 AM, a train carrying a historical mission departed from Platform 6 of the Shanghai North Station. This fast train, after a steady and swift five-hour journey, completed the first trial run of the entire Shanghai-Nanjing route precisely on time. This not only restored the high efficiency of troop transport from before the war but also, due to the temporary breakdown of the air conditioning equipment, reflected the arduous efforts and spirit of the Railway Bureau staff in overcoming difficulties.

Locomotive P5 type 106, personally driven by Deputy Director Xie Zhen, gently pulled nine streamlined carriages out of the station. The exceptionally smooth "start" was such that almost half of the overly delighted passengers (actually a group of reporters and Railway Bureau staff participating in the trial run) barely noticed the station moving backward.

The train's speed gradually increased from 24 kilometers per hour to 64 kilometers per hour, and after seven or eight minutes, it had passed 翔 [unclear place name]. Although the clouds outside the window seemed to press down on the roof, the people inside were unusually excited. In the dining car in the middle, there were square tables for playing cards, and in the observation car at the end, there were comfortable sofas, which attracted the majority of young men and women, creating the atmosphere of two small clubs. They forgot the fatigue from lack of sleep the night before, and even forgot the gradually increasing temperature inside the carriages.

Average Speed of 60 Kilometers Per Hour

The atmosphere in the dining car was more intense than in the observation car. Besides the three or four tables playing cards, one or two tables were occupied by Railway Bureau transportation department staff, seriously recording the speed of the train every kilometer and at every station, comparing it with the planned schedule. Section Chief Xue told me that the fastest speed of this train could reach 85 kilometers per hour, but due to the limitations of the track and speed through stations, the actual average speed was currently 60 kilometers per hour. The fastest section was when passing Kunshan, where the speed reached 75 kilometers per hour. He said that before the war, the fast train had six carriages and stopped at four stations: Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang, arriving in Nanjing in four hours and fifty minutes. The current P5 type locomotive, stopping only at two stations in between, could complete the scheduled five-hour journey to Nanjing without any problems.

Air Conditioning Breakdown - Temperature Spikes

But a problem arose. Shortly after passing Kunshan, passengers in the observation car began moving to the front carriages, noticing that the air conditioning had broken down. The onboard technicians were recording the red line on the thermometer inside the carriages: it reached 83 degrees, and some even went as high as 86 degrees. Engineers and air conditioning technicians were busy inspecting and checking. The conclusion was that one of the three power transmission tubes had broken, and some of the air conditioning units were not powered on, so the temperature lost its proper regulation. Deputy Director Pu of the Machinery Department and other responsible personnel, who were on board to inspect the results, also believed that there might be problems with the ventilation pipes of the Philco air conditioning units in each carriage during installation.

The fast train continued to move forward, and the responsible staff could not go under the carriages to inspect or repair. At 8:05 AM, passing Suzhou Station, the sun broke through the clouds, and the temperature in the carriages increased even more. Some even reached 91 degrees, only slightly lower than the outside temperature.

However, the train's schedule was as accurate as a clock. It arrived in Wuxi at 8:41 AM, stopped for six minutes, passed Changzhou at 9:23:30 AM, and arrived in Zhenjiang at 10:29:30 AM, without the slightest deviation. Only passing the No. 102 bridge under repair at Suzhou Station, it slowed down by two minutes, and passing the diverging track at Suzhou Station also slowed down by one minute, but it made up the time before arriving in Wuxi.

Thus, the fast train pulled into Nanjing Xiaguan Station precisely on time at 11:45 AM, completing the Railway Bureau's expected task of increasing train speed.

Official Launch Date - Still Uncertain

In the afternoon, while Director Peng and others were treating the reporters to strolls around Xinkou or Xuanwu Lake, the streamlined train entered the engine room for maintenance, and Deputy Director Xie and Deputy Director Pu were still sweating profusely repairing the electrical wires and air conditioning.

At 5:50 PM, the train carried us southeast, back to Shanghai. In the dining car, Deputy Director Xie, at the request of reporters, talked about the motivation behind the creation of the streamlined fast train: (1) the Railway Bureau was striving to increase train speed and frequency; (2) it wanted to use the Railway Bureau's existing materials for new structural and technical experiments, hoping to achieve modern international standards on its own. It was absolutely not intended to provide extravagant enjoyment for the wealthy.

In this time of war and chaos, being able to still have this spirit and courage to move forward independently is, of course, beyond reproach. As for the technical details, as long as there is perseverance in continuous research and improvement, as the ancients said, failure is the mother of success. In short, one of the two main goals of the fast train, "train speed," has been absolutely and perfectly achieved. As for the second point, the air conditioning problem, Deputy Director Xie said it would be improved. Regarding whether the official launch would be on the 25th, he shook his head uncertainly.

During the conversation, the fast train had already passed Zhenjiang and encountered a torrential downpour. The carriages were still so stuffy. The windows of the carriages were sealed and could not be opened. Those who couldn't bear the heat stood next to the open carriage doors to cool off. I was lucky enough to find a cool corner in the luggage car, where the door was wide open and there was no luggage, and dozed off until Shanghai. The arrival time at the station was absolutely on time, precisely at 11:50 PM. This was really their only consolation.

### Accused of Colluding with Bandits or a Love Triangle? Sun Pusheng of Jiangyin Killed - Father Sues the Court

[Report from our newspaper, Jiangyin, 21st] Sun Pusheng, also known as Zanyu, a resident of Baizhangli, Xiyangqiao, Mazhen Township, is a shareholder and manager of the Xintai Rubber Factory in Shanghai. On the 6th of this month, he was suddenly arrested by Niu Yusheng, the head of the township, on the grounds of colluding with bandits and killed while allegedly trying to escape. After an investigation by our reporter in the countryside, it seems that there are other secrets to this case.

The deceased's father, Sun Guanyue, came to the city with his wife, Wang, on the 10th to file a lawsuit with the county government and the court, seeking redress. According to the lawsuit, his son Pusheng was engaged in commerce and often returned home. A clansman named Sun Yaowei lived in the village of Houqianxiang. His daughter, named Jinyu, was unmarried and had a good relationship with Pusheng due to their kinship. The township head, Yusheng, seeing that Jinyu was somewhat attractive, wanted to woo her for his own selfish desires, but Jinyu ultimately refused. Yusheng saw that Pusheng and the girl were very close and harbored jealousy. On May 11th, he asked the girl's father to borrow two dan of white rice but failed. When Pusheng returned from Shanghai, he wrote a letter requesting to borrow five dan of rice from the girl, which was also rejected, so he had harbored resentment for a long time. Before plotting the shooting, he first sent someone to hide a revolver in the Sun family's house. When Pusheng returned home on the 6th, he was arrested, subjected to torture, and then dragged to the side of Beitou Village on the pretext of escaping and killed. His father was afraid of being framed in the countryside, so he came to the city to appeal to the relevant authorities, urging them to arrest the murderers and redress the injustice.

According to our reporter's investigation: Sun Pusheng once served as an intelligence officer for the Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, as certified by Director Cao Zheng. He was not a bandit. His father, Sun Guanyue, has filed reports with the Command Post and the Jiangyin County Government, and has also filed a lawsuit with the local court. During the Anti-Japanese War, Sun Pusheng was recommended by Zheng Ziliang, a councilor of the Loyal Salvation Army, to Guangde, Anhui Province, for training, after which he participated in underground work and was irreconcilable with traitors and bandits. After the victory, he transferred to Lixin Accounting School in Shanghai and co-founded the Xintai Rubber Factory with friends in western Shanghai. After being killed on the 6th, he still had a letter from a certain bandit suppression agency dated May 27th, discussing inquiries about the whereabouts of bandits.

It is reported that after Sun Pusheng was killed, Xing Zizhen, a military law officer from the county, performed an autopsy and found serious injuries from torture between the fingernails and toenails. The perpetrator was Xing Xingbao, a member of the self-defense force. The deceased was shot five times, three times in the head, once in the chest, and once in the leg. Given that he was shot five times in a row, and there were no branching paths on the main road, it seems unlikely that he was trying to escape. It is said that the county government has ordered Wu Zongyuan, the district head of Huangtang, to investigate thoroughly. The court will need to exhume the body for another autopsy to determine whether he was trying to escape or was intentionally shot to death, so that the truth can be revealed.

### Chen Enhou, a Bandit from Yongjia, Accomplices Arrested

[Report from our newspaper, Jiangyin, 21st] Chen Enhou, a villager from Baishui Township, Yongjia County, Zhejiang Province, had previously robbed the Yongle steamboat and joined a bandit gang, killing Yang Qingzhen. Some of his accomplices were hiding in the home of Wang Yongsheng in Sanjiali, east of this county. On the 16th, the county police局 and the Houteng security police team arrested Chen Jindu, Chen Shiliu (both from Kukou Township, Yongjia County), Chen Jimin (from Baishui Township, Yongjia County), and Li Chengzhen (from Luwan Township, Yongjia County), who were using cotton flailing as a cover, at Wang's house. They were sent to the county military law office for questioning on the 20th. All denied being bandits, saying that Chen Enhou was currently in Shanghai and they did not know his address. After questioning, they were detained, pending a letter to the Yongjia County Government requesting them to come and pick them up for trial.

Nantong

[Report from our newspaper] A tragic case of a township head burying a deputy township head alive recently occurred in the Puliu district. Yang Hanlin, the deputy township head of Limin Township in the district, was captured by bandits in June. He managed to escape during the suppression by the National Army, leading to disputes with Township Head Ding Hongru over the return of confiscated bean cakes and pigs, which deteriorated their relationship. Later, he was summoned by the township head to a meeting at the township office but never returned. His body was later found in the Jinjiadian grassland, his mouth and nose stuffed with cotton wool, his hands and feet bound, in a pit five feet deep. When the body was being moved, it was shot at by the township self-defense team. With such obvious clues, it should not be difficult to arrest the suspects. The deceased's family is appealing to all parties for justice.

### Suzhou Meat Merchants Stop Trading - Mediation Has Not Yet Yielded Results

Wuxi Meat Merchants Resume Business Today

[Report from our newspaper, Suzhou, 22nd] Suzhou fresh meat merchants have stopped slaughtering and trading for two days. Despite repeated mediation, there have been no results. Although the strike was triggered by the government's adjustment of the slaughter tax rate being too high, the meat merchants have long suffered excessive sacrifices and increasing costs in handling military meat. Based on the situation, it is difficult to resolve in the short term.

[Report from our newspaper, Wuxi, 22nd] The meat merchants' strike has lasted for two days. At 3:00 PM on the 22nd, the county government summoned the slaughter merchants to persuade them. It was agreed that they would resume business first on the 23rd, with the tax rate resolved according to the standards of Suzhou, Changzhou, and other counties. In addition, the newly appointed County Magistrate Zhou, due to the county's financial difficulties, has specially invited the directors and supervisors of the Chamber of Commerce to discuss the issue of collecting business tax and house rent. Also, the Yarn 管 Committee sent personnel to investigate the stored yarn and cloth in various cotton yarn and silk cloth businesses, but there were no results.

### Speaker of Licheng County Council Calls for "Tiger Hunting" - Vice Speaker Denies Accusing County Magistrate

[Report from our newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] Ren Guanshan, Speaker of the Licheng County Council, and others previously accused Yue Bofen, the County Magistrate, of excessive taxation, smuggling for profit, private purchase of firearms, and falsely claiming people's property in a complaint to the Provincial People's Freedom Protection Committee, listing eight major charges against County Magistrate Yue. Li Zong [unclear], the Vice Speaker of the County Council, suddenly invited the Jinan press to Licheng on the 20th in a special car. During the event, Li stated that Speaker Ren's accusations against Yue had not been made with any statement to the County Council or with the consent of the majority of councilors. The move was entirely Ren's personal opinion. County Magistrate Yue also answered each of the eight charges one by one and produced a large number of files for the reporters to review in turn. However, when the reporters were leaving Jinan for Licheng, while waiting for the bus at the Youth Association, the original complainant, Speaker Ren, also detailed Yue Bofen's illegal activities to the reporters and called for "tiger hunting," asking the press for support. This case has now attracted widespread attention in provincial circles, and the provincial government has also begun investigating. If the accusations are true, severe punishment will be imposed to establish a clean and capable new government.

### Impressions of the Oil City

[Report from our newspaper, Lanzhou, by airmail, 20th] Of the many cities and towns I have visited, the most exciting is the oil city built in Laojunmiao. The city gate faces north. When you arrive at the inspection station (entrance) and armed police officers ask you about your mission inside, you are facing the distant South Mountain. This oil city is nestled in the embrace of these many mountains. Slightly turning to the right, you can see the new refinery, built at the four platforms near the Oil River, with an excellent environment and location. Nearby is an oil storage yard, but it is a bit far from the production center. After entering, there is a [unclear] shaped road about one Chinese mile long, with employee residential areas on both sides and a nursery in the middle. In Laojunmiao, it takes extraordinary effort to make trees grow, and this place can be said to be the green [unclear] of Laojunmiao.

At the top of the U-shaped road is the general office [unclear] and the Guang塲 that created Boshan Road, opposite is a large auditorium that can accommodate 500 people. Although the construction cost is high, this place is far from the city and there are no other entertainment venues, so it is extremely needed.

On the left side of the U-shaped road, the road is very flat, next to the pottery 塲 (ie, brick kiln股), where fire bricks and various ceramic utensils for household use are fired for refineries and molten 欲 [unclear] furnaces. There are currently about [unclear] donkeys, used to grind and carry various stones needed for work from distant places.

On both sides of the auditorium are staff dormitories and reception rooms (referring to Qilian Villa). Next to the reception room, there are many brick kilns, using slag oil as fuel to burn bricks and lime.

Proceeding along the wide and open road, on the right is the stable (驮运股), with horses, mules, donkeys, camels, and cattle. On the left are many ordinary bungalows. Further to the left are the school and the flour mill.

Continuing south, on the right is the food and other supply [unclear] (ie, supply [unclear] 社), which can produce large quantities of clothing, shoes, soy sauce, tofu, and various snacks; such facilities require organization and funding. Further ahead, on the right [unclear] is the Transportation [unclear] Section, and on the left is the hospital and the electromechanical factory.

At the end of the two-mile-long road, you can see many mule carts, fully loaded with oil and water to supply the approximately 5,000 employees in the mine (now increased to [unclear] people). The continued use of this kind of transport [unclear] seems wasteful in modern times. [unclear] Gu [unclear] The entire oil city is covered in black smoke, and the air is polluted, making it difficult for children to stay clean. For the sake of economy and health [unclear], these shortcomings can definitely be improved when material conditions are sufficient. (Currently, [unclear] parts have been converted to natural gas as fuel, and water pipes are being laid)

To the right at the end, you can overlook the Oil River winding down 300 feet below the cliff into the desert plain, parallel to the main road. After arriving here, what you see further enhances our deep impression of Laojunmiao. And due to this cross-section, the structure of the strata can be seen very clearly, making geologists even more excited.

Walking down the bay road, you soon reach the historically significant red temple - Laojunmiao. The incense is still thriving today. Nearby, you can see the remains of the old well, the closed Well No. 5. From the pressure and oil immersion, it is estimated that it can still produce several barrels of oil per day. The old refinery is on the bank of the Oil River, capable of refining a thousand barrels of crude oil per day. The oil city, with its seven-year history, originated here. The oilfield was discovered very early on, and it was developed due to the urgent need for oil during the war. Because it is far from the city, supplies are difficult, which hindered development, but this emerging industry is [unclear] and continuing to grow.

Returning to the mountainside, continuing to the left will lead to the mine. Many wells on the top floor are about 2,530 meters above sea level, 200 meters higher than the other wells. Recently, mining is continuing to the east and south, because the oilfield there is more promising than here. If the equipment is sufficient, due to the energy and experience of all the employees here, this plan will definitely be achieved first. (Note: This article is an abridged version of a diary by Mr. Binnick, an English member of the Ganqing Oilfield Survey Team, after visiting Laojunmiao last year. [unclear] into.)

### The Gold Control Bureau Orders Banks, Money Shops, and Trust Companies to Limit Overdrafts for Large Customers - All Similar Offset Agreements Should Be Investigated and Reported

[Report from our newspaper] In the recent process of inspecting banks and trust companies, the Gold Control Bureau found that the overdraft agreements signed between banks and customers were extremely large in amount. Moreover, the agreed amounts were often temporarily increased. Often, the overdraft limits set by one or two customers exceeded the total amount of their deposits, which not only violated the provisions of the Banking Law but also posed a considerable risk. For this reason, the Gold Control Bureau has ordered the Bank, Money Shop and Trust Company Association of this city to instruct its member banks and companies to absolutely limit large overdrafts or concentrated lending to a small number of customers in the future, to avoid expanding credit and stimulating prices. For those that are disguised substitutes for offsets, they should also, in accordance with the trial offset method for collection bills, prepare a report form listing each customer who has an offset agreement or a temporary overdraft agreement that is similar to an offset agreement, including the customer's name, account number, address, amount, term, and guarantor, and submit it to the bureau for verification.

### Rumors Fuel Selling - Chinese Stocks Lack the Strength to Rise

The rise of Chinese stocks yesterday was only temporary. Apart from Meilin steadily rising to its limit and Wuhe having increased information remaining relatively stable, they were particularly weak. With credit remaining uncertain and rumors fueling selling, they lacked the strength to rise.

Initially, they followed the momentum from the previous day and tended to flourish, with all stocks opening higher to some extent. Yongsah started at 12,000 yuan, and 4 and 205 and other stocks quickly closed at a high price, immediately falling to 11,600 yuan. 35 and 154 and other stocks took advantage of the low and advanced to 11,600 yuan, but credit remained scarce, and 200 and 220 and other stocks were still keen to sell, falling to 250 yuan. People from the Guangdong banking community and the draft banking community were buying, and 218 and 95 and other stocks were replenished, recovering to 11,760 yuan near noon, closing at 11,720 yuan at noon. Compared with the previous close, Meilin and Land Inflation rose to the limit, Zhabei, Sino-French and Sino-Clothing fell by half a percent, and the rise and fall of the remaining stocks were minimal.

In the afternoon, Yongsah rose to 12,135 yuan, but 148 and 76 and other stocks were sold. The evening news reported a cessation of large overdrafts, triggering rumors of restrictions on withdrawals and falling to 11,650 yuan. Although 89 and 99 and other stocks advanced to 11,900 yuan, people's sentiment was not optimistic about the environment, and rumors were unfavorable to the multi-party side, with 143 and 154 and other stocks being sold off, falling to 11,400 yuan. Although the National Bank exchange difference came out, it recovered by 250 yuan, but was ultimately suppressed, closing at 11,450 yuan. Shanghai Cement showed a tragic decline to the limit. Wuhe had information about right increases and was relatively stable. Meilin still rose to the limit. Compared with the morning close, Zhabei remained flat, Xinguang, Jingfu, Meiya, Xinhe, Tongyi, Rongfeng, Guohuo, China Silk, Huafeng, Sino-French, and Yonggong were each down half a percent, Meilin rose [unclear], Shanghai Cement fell to the limit, and the rest declined slightly. Unlisted stocks outside the market remained stable and unchanged.

Government Bonds

Yesterday, Class C bonds rose and other bonds fell. Class C bonds opened at 1.12 million in the morning, and retreated from 1.15 million to 1.03 million, and then stabilized slightly. Compared with the previous close, Class A and Class B were flat, Class C rose by 40,000 yuan, Class D fell by 20,000 yuan, and Class E also fell by 30,000 yuan, with more than 3 million changing hands.

### Credit Eases - Bank Balance Differences

Yesterday, the city's credit began to ease. In the exchange of bank notes by the four banks, two bureaus and one treasury, the Central Bank had a large net outflow, so even though most had a net inflow, the average finally resulted in a net outflow of 289.2 billion. Among them, the Central Bank had a net outflow of 1,053.6 billion, the Bank of China had a net inflow of 86.9 billion, the Bank of Communications had a net inflow of 381.2 billion, the Farmers Bank had a net inflow of 107.7 billion, the China Trust Bureau had a net inflow of 459.2 billion, the Postal Savings Bureau had a net outflow of 543.4 billion, the Central Cooperative Treasury had a net inflow of 272.3 billion, commercial banks had a large net outflow of 33.1 billion, and small exchanges had a net outflow of 12,570 billion. Foreign banks had a total net inflow of 18,723 billion.

### Changes in Interbank Lending Rates

Starting today (23rd), the daily rate on savings deposits for banks and trust companies will be changed to 2 yuan per thousand, the daily rate on interbank lending will be changed to 10 yuan per thousand, and the daily rate on loans will be changed to 12 yuan per thousand.

### National Banks and Bureaus Cease Small Loans

In order to tighten credit, the financial authorities have already implemented strict reviews of all loans, rejecting all but those that are absolutely necessary. Now that credit has gradually loosened again, national banks and bureaus are strengthening the tightening of credit, and all banks and bureaus have recently ceased small loans.

### Silk Weak and Declining

Rayon futures fell sharply. The "Xu" brand No. 120 with luster opened in the morning as low as 2.3 billion yuan. The credit situation in the industry remained tight, with more selling than buying, leading to a continued decline. The immediate settlement price at noon fell to 2.18 billion yuan, and the deferred delivery price was 150 million yuan higher. The afternoon opening was higher, trading at 2.41 billion yuan, with many taking advantage of the high price to sell off. The smallest decline was to 2.18 billion yuan. Later, news spread that credit was gradually loosening, and in an instant, the price rose to 2.3 billion yuan. It once fell to 2.25 billion yuan, and the closing price rose again to 2.3 billion yuan. Outside the market, the asking price was around 2.35 billion yuan.

Factory-Reeled Silk

Yesterday's market was slightly weak, and there were few transactions for all grades of five-bale lots. Asking prices fell by 30 million to 50 million yuan. Grade C was quoted at 3.5 billion yuan, Grade D at 3 billion yuan, and the highest transaction for high-grade odd lots was 3 billion yuan. Later, the first-grade was traded at 2.5 billion yuan. Dry-reeled silk prices were very firm, with high-grade odd lots trading at 1.8 billion yuan.

Silk Fabrics

Yesterday's market declined slightly. Huaqiang Real Silk quilt covers opened in the morning at around 1.5 billion yuan, rising to a high of 1.57 billion yuan. Later, due to great market uncertainty and an imbalance between supply and demand, prices fell steadily. The immediate settlement price at the close was 1.45 billion yuan, and the deferred delivery price was 100 million yuan higher. Big Cheng checkered crepe from Jiangsu was very scarce in the market, so transactions were extremely rare, with asking prices within the 5 million yuan range. In the afternoon, the price of quilt covers rose and fell, eventually declining to around 1.4 billion yuan.

### Allocation of Raw Silk for Processing and Export, the Export Control Committee Continues to Handle

In order to support silk fabric exporters and develop exports, the Export Control Committee specially consulted with the Central Bank and the Central Trust of China (CTC) and other relevant agencies, and the CTC agreed to allocate 200 bales of raw silk to silk fabric manufacturers for processing and export. It was stipulated that in order to allocate raw silk, applying manufacturers must submit letters of credit from abroad, or purchase contracts and certifications, calculated at US$3.5 per pound. For nearly two months, manufacturers have generally lacked confidence in exports. In addition to the 30 bales previously allocated, another 20 bales were allocated on the 20th.

### Promissory Notes Flood Chongqing

The Pacification Headquarters Ordered Strict Control
[Our Chongqing Dispatch on the 22nd] After the issuance of large denomination banknotes, the Pacification Headquarters closely monitored the flood of promissory notes in Chongqing. It has ordered the Chongqing Central Bank to strictly control the issuance of promissory notes by various banks and money shops, and to conduct inspections at any time. If there is any abuse of issuance, it should be reported to the Pacification Headquarters and the Ministry of Finance for handling.

### Tea Market Returns to Level

Yesterday, tea merchants at Honglou were still wary of the high prices and remained hesitant, while sellers felt that costs were standing at a high peak and could not bear to easily sell at a loss. Therefore, the process did not escape the state of scarce buying and selling. Transactions were sparse, and the trend, which was initially stable, fluctuated again later. However, the final result at the close was that prices generally returned to level amid tight credit conditions.

It is learned that the Qi-Men black tea of this year, which has been in Shanghai for a long time, has been sought after by British export firms, but their bids have been stingy. It is said that shops and firms on this street are gradually planning to expand their purchases to meet retail demand.

### Rice Asking Prices Rise, White Sugar and Thin Rice Also Break the 40 Million Barrier

Yesterday's rice market rose in the morning and fell back in the afternoon. Initially, due to a slight loosening of credit, various commodities outside the industry rose, and the tin market also rose again, so market confidence was restored, and cargo owners raised asking prices. Early openings for white glutinous rice and thin rice were both at 41.2 million yuan, but later, because the market outlet remained sluggish, prices fell back. Glutinous rice and thin rice each stood at 40 million yuan, and extra-high-quality glutinous rice was at 43 million yuan, each up 3 million yuan. The market became even weaker at the close, with only a nominal increase of 2 million yuan.

Wheat Flour

Rose sharply, because credit slightly loosened and tin prices rose. The opening was the most brisk. Under the pressure of cargo owners, Old Brand opened at 13 million yuan. Floating goods were released at the close, at 12.6 million yuan, an increase of 800,000 yuan. Warship Brand flour rose by 300,000 yuan, closing at 11.6 million yuan. Other "Xiong" Brand flour rose uniformly by 300,000 to 500,000 yuan. Bran rose by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, and small bags of bran opened at 6.6 million yuan in the afternoon.

Coarse Grains

Turned firmer, but weakened again at the close. The morning opening was due to a slight loosening of credit, and market sentiment was buoyant. Green beans were quoted as high as 17.5 million yuan, closing at 17 million yuan, an increase of 500,000 to 1 million yuan. Corn and naked barley initially rose by 2 million yuan at the opening, but both weakened at the close. Mung beans rose by 2 million yuan, sesame seeds rose by 1.5 million yuan, and raw peanuts from Guangdong were purchased again, rising by 1 million to 2 million yuan.

Cooking Oil

Rose in the morning and weakened in the afternoon, resulting in a flat result. As soon as credit slightly loosened, cargo owners took the opportunity to raise prices. Soybean oil opened in the morning trading at 86 million yuan, but because sales were very small, it immediately weakened, returning to 80 million yuan, a slight increase of 1 million yuan. Rapeseed oil retreated to 80 million yuan, also considered flat. The opening price of Lucky Brand raw oil was already flat, so it was traded at the original price. Small truck sesame oil added 1 million yuan, and soybean cake added 500,000 to 600,000 yuan in the morning, but fell at the close, resulting in a slight decline.

### Yarn and Cloth Fluctuations Narrow, Blue Phoenix Fine Yarn Price on Par with the Previous Day

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions showed that credit conditions were inconsistent among those in the industry, and the market price was very high, so market sentiment was somewhat hesitant. The opening was still considered firm and high. The asking price for 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was once brisk at around 1.8 billion yuan, but later, because some cargo owners had tight positions, the price fell from its peak to settle at 1.7 billion yuan, on par with the previous day. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn rose and fell by turns. It is said that a total of 136 transactions were made throughout the day.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions were initially firm and brisk due to favorable news from the previous day. The buying power of strong investors was also strong. Because the buyers' funds had not arrived, they were all watching and waiting. The industry players on this street were all selling off at the high prices. Moreover, the Textile Construction Corporation auctioned off Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi Serge. Inside the market, the initial asking price for Longtou fine cloth was 52.5 million yuan (5 million yuan outside the market).

Regarding the student rice allocation matter, Mayor Wu promised to continue to give preferential treatment, calculating at a rate of 50% lower than the per capita rationed rice price.

How much the total amount will be for this semester will have to wait until the tuition standards of each school are determined in mid-to-late August, and then the ten university presidents will visit Mayor Wu for discussion and decision, and then the municipal government will launch a fundraising campaign from all sectors of society. In order to reward outstanding students from poor families and take the lead in advocating, the municipal government has allocated 50 billion yuan as scholarships, and the funds are currently stored in the municipal bank.

### Academic Visit, Private East Asia Physical Education College

Overview

The school was founded in the 7th year of the Republic of China (1918) on Fangxie Road in Nanshi. In the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929), it purchased land on Caotang Street, Luban Road, built its own school buildings, and registered with the Ministry of Education. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, Nanshi was located in the war zone, and the school moved into the former French Concession to continue operations. After the Pacific War began, President Chen Mengyu was resented for assisting the central government in resisting Japan, and was repeatedly searched and arrested, so he could only secretly go to the mainland and serve as a member of the National Physical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education. The school was forced to close.

After the victory, President Chen immediately returned to Shanghai from Chongqing to plan the restoration of the school. Because the school buildings on Caotang Street were destroyed, Li Peitian, a member of the board of directors, allocated the old site of the former China Public School on Wenzhi Road, Jiangwan, to be used as the school. However, the site had already been set up as the No. 22 District Central Primary School, so the Municipal Education Bureau allocated a portion of the buildings of the Municipal Sports Ground to the school for use, so the school's site is the ideal environment for a sports school, where the 7th National Games were held. Currently, there is a two-year physical education major, a five-year physical education college, a scout trainer training class, and affiliated high schools and junior high schools, with a total of more than 300 male and female students. Chen Mengyu is the president of the college, Hou Jiyuan is the principal of the middle school, Jiang Xiangqing is the director of academic affairs, Yang Pinji is the director of discipline, and Hu Xidi is the director of general affairs.

Enrollment

This fall, the school will enroll 50 new students each in the two-year and five-year colleges, scout training classes, and affiliated high school and junior high school first grades. In addition, there will be 20 transfer students each for the second term of the first year of the two-year college, the second term of the first year of the five-year college, the first term of the second year, and the first term of the second year of high school and junior high school. Both men and women are accepted, and board and lodging are available. In order to cultivate physical education teachers, the Ministry of Education has ordered the education departments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Fujian provinces and the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau to select outstanding students and recommend them to the two-year and five-year physical education colleges of the school for training. Young men and women who aspire to learn physical education can apply to their respective education departments and bureaus for recommendation.

Registration for the school starts today. The examination period is the first time on August 1st and the second time on August 22nd. It will be held simultaneously at the school in Shanghai and at the Provincial Sports Ground in Changsha, Hunan.

### Food Is Precious in London, Athletes' Food Is Coveted by Thieves

[Reuters, Richmond, London, 21st] At the World Games athletes' camp in Richmond Park, the Royal Botanic Gardens, twenty students from several countries have formed a nighttime food watch team.

### Our Country's World Games Athletes Unaccustomed to Bland British Food

[Central News Agency, London, 21st] Our athletes attending the World Games are currently residing in the World Games center area in Uxbridge. They are very unaccustomed to the "bland" British food. They find it difficult to swallow the cold vegetarian food that is the main food. Although our delegation has brought its own chefs and food such as white rice and ham, this food still needs to be negotiated before it can be transported out of the customs warehouse. For the past few days, our athletes have been eating British food, sometimes with a little white rice. White rice is already a rare delicacy here, and most of our representatives believe that this food will drastically affect their performance in the competition. The person in charge of our delegation is preparing to provide regular Chinese meals for the representatives within the next week. Our delegation began to practice slightly yesterday after arriving here for two days of sightseeing, but they felt quite tired due to the long journey and unaccustomed climate. In addition, two team members have a minor cold, but they should be cured by the time of the competition. Our track and field athletes Lou Wen'ao, Huang Liangzheng, and Chen Yinglang have been practicing hard separately. Lou Wen'ao, our country's 10,000-meter athlete with the best hope of winning, is participating in the 5,000-meter, 10,000-meter, and marathon events. As of now, Lou seems indifferent, but according to sources, he will show his special abilities on the day of the competition. According to the schedule, Lou will participate in the 10,000-meter final on the 30th of this month, the 5,000-meter final on the 31st, and the marathon on August 17th. Huang Liangzheng, our hurdles representative, will participate in the low hurdles final on July 31st. Wu Chuanyu, our 19-year-old swimming representative, practices in the Uxbridge swimming pool and the Wembley Stadium swimming pool every day, waiting for the 100-meter swimming trials.

### Reader Consultation Legal Questions Joint Investment in Grain Store; Mutual Disputes over Rights and Interests

Mr. Sheng Shihua asks: A and B jointly raised funds to open a grain store. The total capital is divided into three shares. A holds two shares and B holds one share. A is the manager. Because of family affairs, B cannot personally take care of the store. B commissions his close relative, C, to be stationed in the store to assist A in management. However, A uses C's lack of experience as an excuse to refuse B's request. Therefore, the two parties have conflicting opinions, almost to the point of turning against each other. In order to protect his own rights and interests, B insists on not giving in. Now there are several questions that I would be grateful if you could answer: (1) Because B is unable to personally take up the position due to family affairs, does he have the right to appoint another person to act as his agent? (2) Most of the store's employees are A's relatives and friends, which creates the suspicion that A is monopolizing power. Moreover, the employees recommended by B are rejected by A with excuses. In order to protect his overall benefits, what kind of countermeasures should B take to be legal?

[Lawyer Fu Kuang answers] The situation described in your letter is an event in which partners agree to contribute capital to operate a joint business. A and B have the right and responsibility to jointly execute the partnership affairs. If B is unable to execute the partnership affairs due to family affairs, A has no right to prevent B from appointing C to act as his agent. If B is only introducing C to work at the store, it is another matter whether A, as the manager, should add a store partner. If B has not executed the partnership affairs, B may still inspect the partnership affairs and its property status at any time, and may inspect the account books (see Article 675 of the Civil Code).

Recently, I returned to Nanjing from Shanghai. Although the train ticket has risen to over two million, it is only the price of one dou of rice, which is still cheaper compared to other things. Therefore, there are many passengers getting on and off at each station, and most of them no longer consider the difference between second class and third class. Poverty, on the contrary, makes people extravagant, which is also a miracle. When the train arrived in Zhenjiang, except for a portion who rushed to the Zhenjiang South Station to get on the train and found seats, those boarding in Zhenjiang could only stand in the crowd. I was sitting close to the window. Two young passengers spotted the empty seat and threw their handbags in first to reserve the seat, and then climbed in through the window. While others were crowding at the train door, they were already there, fanning themselves contentedly.

But they immediately lowered the iron screen on the train window. I said, "The weather is so stuffy, and there's no wind or sand. Why are you lowering it?" He answered well: "This way, they can't climb in through the window anymore!" I couldn't help but get angry: "How can you be so selfish? This is outrageous!" I immediately pulled up the screen: "Look, besides you, who else is climbing in through the window?" After all, I was a bit righteous, and the two passengers didn't dare to say anything. Several images floated into my mind, and I felt that they represented the different styles on stage and off stage.

China has always emphasized "being strict with oneself and lenient with others," which further reflects the problem of often seeing others' faults clearly but being blind to one's own. Moreover, because of the difference in positions, the arguments are completely different before and after, and the events before and after are completely different, which is even more common. From the standpoint of an observer, I even somewhat disliked that my seat was already occupied, so I loudly opposed them climbing through the window. Supposing I were a passenger waiting to board the train, then it would be a different thought. During the Guilin-Liuzhou Campaign, it was common to escape on the train through the windows. Each station had people who specialized in pushing passengers' butts to help them get through the windows, costing hundreds of yuan per push. For the sake of their own safety, they would not hesitate to spend these hundreds of French currency, and even fear that they would not be able to get in through the window. To those "brokers" who helped people, they were too grateful to blame them for extortion. So after I complained about my two neighbors, I couldn't help but feel a little regret, feeling that I was too lacking in forgiveness.

When we are on the verge of survival, we will fight, even sacrificing others is acceptable, because after all, our own lives are more important than others, which is what is meant by "forced by necessity." During wartime escapes, the strong often squeezed the weak off public transportation. It is hateful, of course, but also somewhat understandable. But if it is a time of peace and order, it can never be condoned, because this is an unreasonable expansion of selfishness. The reason why I felt uncomfortable with the two passengers closing the screen was mainly because they were too partial to themselves; they sacrificed the convenience of others for their own benefit. Then, extending from this, if they were on stage, engaged in national affairs, they would definitely be proponents of killing the chicken to get the eggs; they would not want to establish others while establishing themselves; they would not want to help others reach their goals while reaching their own; instead, they would establish themselves (abandoning the right path) and others would have to fall, they would reach their goals and others would have to suffer. This style is absolutely undesirable.

I used to read Han Feizi's "Saying Difficulty" and felt quite puzzled as to how the stammering Han could say these words specifically for figuring out people's hearts. It turned out that although Han Fei was not skilled in technology, he was an expert in theory. His foundation was nothing more than putting himself in someone else's shoes. But the two words "putting oneself" are really very difficult, because everyone will be blinded by their position and will not see something, just like that petty thief in "Qu You Pian" of Lu Shi Chunqiu, who dared to snatch people's gold bars in the market. When he committed the crime, others asked him, and he said, "I only saw the gold bars, I didn't see the people!" Although it is a parable, it cannot deny this truth. Don't we also have guys who add an ounce of copper to every gold bar today? There are many things that obscure people's eyes, but the bright gold bar is the easiest to take effect. I think there is always a line between the stage and off the stage, and this line is enough to obscure people's eyes, or its function may have something to do with gold bars, which is also unknown. This is an important reason why putting oneself in someone else's shoes becomes impossible, and the ancients in the song said, "The lord rides in a carriage, I wear a bamboo hat; we greet by bowing when we meet another day." On the surface, it is to not forget the old, to be polite, but in essence, it is to not be enveloped by a smoky atmosphere. This matter seems easy, but it is quite tortuous to implement. After Emperor Hui of Jin asked about the grievances of the people, there was the joke of "Why not eat minced meat if there is a famine in the world." Scholars often criticize this kind of thing, saying that he is a foolish emperor, but in fact, if I were the Jin Emperor in the deep palace, I am afraid that I would not even be able to say this kind of "joke." Look at Emperor Hui's father, didn't he just ride his sheep carriage to visit the palace women every day, having fun with his three thousand beauties? Alas!

### The Housing Shortage in the United States Too

— Cang Yu

The housing shortage in American cities is no less than that in Shanghai. Although renting a house has not yet reached the point of using gold bars as a premium, disguised premiums have already appeared. In the classified advertisements for housing, those future tenants often declare that they are willing to increase the rent to the landlord with physical objects or labor, such as free dental treatment for life, presenting a wireless phototelegraph machine, free singing and piano lessons for one year, presenting a set of bathroom appliances, presenting a set of interior decorations worth 500 yuan, etc., in a wide variety of ways. From the additional conditions, one can often see the tenant's occupation and cultivation.

### Near Sentences in Deep Clouds

— Bai Jiao

Following Zhang Suoti's Painting of Landscape, Relying on Drunkenness to Write This

Holding high the jade, still looking at the treasures on the wall, the saliva of the clouds seeks to convey the spirit, the eight directions of war gas urge cold and hunger, who is the master of the ancient world? The heights are still suspected of peeking at the chess players, the depths have already eliminated the mountain people, on the edge of the dignity today, rest and seek taste, leaving me to feel foolish and stepping into the sea.

Presented to Shi Ranshu Fan

For several years, the warhorses were together in pale yellow, returning from the adventure, the beard was not frost, the reputation of the Jiangjie was rampant in poetry, the world in the guest was open in the wine shop, pitying each other's chest with the atmosphere of wind and clouds, cherishing the light of the sun and moon in the world, wanting to gnaw at the teeth and still be full of mouth, not hesitating to get drunk in the field.

### A Good Publication

— Shuang Lu

Americans have the habit of reading, but among the books and publications, I am afraid that none is worse than the United States, and if there is, it would be only China? For example, American comic strips fly all over the streets, and their degree of obscenity, theft, and absurdity is no less than the harm suffered by children and the general public in our country. But truly excellent publications are not non-existent. The worst and the best can coexist without contradicting each other. Perhaps this is a kind of "feature" of American cultural tradition?

Among American high-level publications, those that are not purely academic in nature but can absorb general high-level readers, those that focus on literature and art include "The Atlantic" monthly, and those that focus on thought and contemporary history include "Harper's" magazine. Both are sister publications in the American high-level reading world, and both have a history of about 100 years since their creation. Each issue can sell tens of thousands of copies. Because ordinary American publications have to be sold to other English-speaking countries, a circulation of more than 100,000 copies is considered very pitiful. The lack of "soul mates" in knowledge is the same at home and abroad.

Since its creation, "Harper's" has always maintained its format similar to the sixteen-open book, but starting in July, it was changed to a larger format (similar to the "Time" magazine format). The reason is that modern printing presses are suitable for printing large sizes. In order for "Harper's" to maintain its original format, the printer requested an increase of 27 percent in printing costs. The economy of a good publication is often strained. In order to reduce costs, "Harper's" can only adapt to reality and change the version, which was not its original intention. Fortunately, the change in form is not important. As the editor of the publication said: "We changed the coat, but we did not change our character... This is still a publication for people who know how to read and intend to know how to read..."

The editor of the publication, F.L. Allen, is a scholar who pays attention to contemporary history, a graduate of Harvard, and once worked as an assistant editor at E. Sage 成克, the editor of "The Atlantic." He has written two contemporary histories, "Only Yesterday" and "Since Yesterday." The former sold more than 750,000 copies. He is not only a successful editor, but also a successful writer.

"Harper's" receives about 1,900 submissions every month, and each one is read by the editors. Among these submissions, there are often good articles. Several famous works in the publication were also unsolicited and automatically submitted. It can be seen that the publication has a high status, and famous writers will not hesitate to contribute. Not long ago, the publication published an article "Who is Loyal to America" by Columbia history professor H.S. Commager, which talked about American xenophobia. It was an unsolicited submission. As soon as the article came out, 65,000 readers wrote to request the article to be reprinted. There was also an article by former US Secretary of the Army Stimson about how the US military authorities decided to use the atomic bomb against Japan during the war. Stimson personally took the article to "Harper's." When it was published, the biggest headline was made on the cover. It can be seen that for a publication, to achieve "a forest of famous works," it cannot be achieved by editors only bowing and scraping. It must first be done so that the publication itself has authority.

It is unimaginable for "Harper's" readers to read 1,900 manuscripts a month, but such a publication has no more than eight main articles, but there are six full-time editors and two part-time editors to cope with this heavy manuscript reading work. This matter is also very different from our country. "Our" editors often edit two publications alone, or even four or five. How can they have the spare time to review the submitted foreign manuscripts? A simple monthly magazine uses eight editors, which is also something that our country has never had.

The publication also has an advantage, that is, every Tuesday, eight editors hold an editorial meeting to conduct detailed reviews of the material allocation for the next issue. Even the female trainees in the editorial department can participate and give opinions. And the editor-in-chief Allen, he himself said: "I am just a referee."

### The Unbearable Old Book Market of Beiping

— Yi Yun

In the past years, there were many old bookstores in Beiping. Their thread-bound books were always treasured by literati and collectors. Every time a good copy was obtained, it was cherished like a precious treasure. Booksellers also knew a lot about editions and spoke eloquently, as if enumerating family treasures. Every year during the old lunar New Year, the Sea Mound opened, and books were piled up like mountains under the reed tents, and many people bought them. Today, it is very different. Thread-bound old books have become the cheapest things. There are even cases where they cannot be sold at all and are sold by the pound as waste paper. The Palace Edition Twenty-Four Histories is only priced at 40 million. There are 64 large volumes of Gu Wenzhou Jian, a meticulously printed imitation of the Ming edition on Lian Shi paper with five colors, divided into eight cloth cases, priced at only 2 million. Weighing its weight, it reaches more than ten catties, and each catty is only worth more than 100,000 yuan, which is not even as good as the price of selling old newspapers in the south. Compared with the price of pork in Ping, which is 560,000 yuan per catty, the difference is too great. A friend bought 20 copies of the Palace Museum's Xiqing Xu Jian printed on Lian Shi paper, with a porcelain green paper cover and silk thread meticulously bound, stored in two cloth cases, priced at only 1 million, and each copy was only worth 50,000. The bookseller said that it was only selling the price of silk thread, which is true. There are not many old bookstores in Liulichang anymore. In addition, there are several in Longfusi Street and four or five in Xidan Street. They are all deserted and selling cheaply. According to this trend, in the future, they will all inevitably be sold as waste paper, and it is possible to see Song, Yuan, and Ming editions in the wrapping paper of sesame cakes, peanuts, and other snacks. As for the Southern Paper Shops, except for Rongbaozhai and Qingmigou, which still retain their old style, the rest have all changed their quality and also sell other things. The decline of their main business can be imagined.

### The Golden Age of Peking University

— Da Peng

Lord Ling Xiaohan of the Han Pavilion repeatedly spoke of Peking University alumni during his talks, but all he mentioned were those from before the fifth year of the Republic (1916), and the alumni from the era of the Imperial University of Peking. It seems that Lord Pavilion had already left Peking University by the period from the fifth to the eighth year of the Republic (1916-1919), so he did not mention the alumni of this era. In fact, Peking University produced talented individuals in great numbers, and this period was its golden age. With over three thousand students, it was known as the highest institution of learning in the country. President Cai Yuanpei broadly recruited and included individuals of diverse views. Among the professors were Lin Qinnan and Gu Tangsheng, who held extremely outdated ideas, and Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi, who were extremely modern. The student body was also extremely diverse, including supporters of the monarchy, members of the Kuomintang, communists, members of the Anfu Clique, members of the Research Clique, military men (a classmate surnamed Tong, who once served as a brigade commander under Wu Peifu), remnants of the Qing Dynasty, and a variety of other types. However, because the entrance examinations were extremely strict (the first test included Chinese, a foreign language, and mathematics, and each subject required a score of sixty or above. If one scored one hundred in Chinese but fifty-nine in mathematics, they would be rejected and not allowed to participate in the second test), although the composition of the student body was diverse, there was no padding of the ranks with unqualified individuals. In the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), after the success of the Northern Expedition, Peking University alumni holding positions in the central government and in various provinces and cities accounted for more than five out of ten. It is remembered that when He Jingzhi was in charge of Zhejiang's administration, the head of the Civil Affairs Department was Peking University professor Ma Yichu (Xu Lun), and forty-six of the seventy-five county magistrates in Zhejiang Province were Peking University alumni. Although their numbers gradually decreased thereafter, the number of Peking University alumni distributed throughout various national institutions was still considerable. In the eighth year of the Republic (1919), Fu Sinian, Luo Jialun, Duan Xipeng, and two others, who were sent abroad with funding from the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, were all Peking University alumni. At the time, they were known as the "Five Ministers Going Abroad." All five of these individuals have already gained fame in their time, so there is no need to elaborate. Others, such as the recently specially appointed Minister of Examinations, Tian Jiongjin (Yunqing), was also a Peking University alumnus who graduated in the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924). Deputy Minister Shen Shiyuan was a Peking University professor and concurrently the Director of the Office of Academic Affairs. When Tian was studying at Peking University, Shen was still working at the school. The fact that they were once teacher and student and are now colleagues is also a good story. Furthermore, Deng Feihuang, the recently appointed Civil Affairs Director of Hunan Province (graduated from the Department of Economics in the thirteenth year of the Republic), is also a Peking University alumnus.

Also, there is Liu Hangchen, a wealthy man from Sichuan; Yuan Guanxin (original name Shibin), the Civil Affairs Director of Guizhou; Fu Rulin (Mubo), who once served as the Deputy Minister of the Interior and Chairman of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission and is currently the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the China Industrial Bank; Zhong Tianxin (original name Ruzhong), a member of the Legislative Yuan who once served as the Director of Education of Zhejiang and is currently the General Manager of Zhengzhong Book Company; Di Ying, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee; Hu Ruoyu, the former mayor of Qingdao; Jiang Zhicheng, the former mayor of Chongqing; Wang Kunlun (original name Ruxing, currently under orders to go to the United States for observation), a member of the Central Supervisory Committee and Legislative Yuan; Ye Fenghu, a Shanghai city councilor (who once served as the county magistrate of Hangzhou); and Zhou Yizhi, who served as a member of the Legislative Yuan for twenty years and is now practicing law in Shanghai, are all alumni who graduated in the twelfth or thirteenth year of the Republic (1923-1924). Furthermore, it must be noted that Mao Zedong also audited classes at Peking University in the ninth year of the Republic (1920) and worked part-time in the Peking University Library (introduced by Li Dazhao, who was then a professor at Peking University and was executed in Beijing by Zhang Zuolin in the fourteenth year of the Republic (1925) on the charge of being a communist. Among those executed at the same time were eleven people, including Zhang Yiguan, a female student at Peking University). His monthly salary was only thirty-five yuan. The above are only those known to me, and they are all Peking University alumni who studied before and after the May Fourth Movement. Peking University classmates had relatively little interaction with each other while at school, and omissions are inevitable.
