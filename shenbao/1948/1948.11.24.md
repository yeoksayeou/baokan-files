[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 23rd] (1) The National Army on the eastern front formally recovered Daxujia at dawn on the 23rd, and by noon had advanced to five miles east of the village. The Huang Army Group, which had been fighting fiercely in Nianzhuang for two weeks, in coordination with strong air power, routed the bandits it faced and began advancing westward at the earliest opportunity on the 23rd. By dusk on the 23rd, our Qiu, Li, and Huang three major army groups may converge between Bayiji and Daxujia. Daxujia is located 70 li directly east of Xuzhou, with more than 300 households. The bandits had built solid fortifications there and stationed heavy troops, attempting to prevent our pursuing troops from advancing eastward. Now, with the close cooperation of our land, air, artillery, and tank units, they were finally destroyed. The results of the battle are currently being investigated. Bayiji Station is located 30 li east of Daxujia, and Cao Baji is located 5 li south of the station. (2) On the southern route, our strong army groups approached Su County on the morning of the 23rd, echoing the army groups moving south from Xuzhou, and fiercely shelled the bandits fleeing between the three forts of Su County.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 23rd] After the Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi Army Groups on the eastern front completely recovered Daxujia at 5:00 AM on the 23rd, they continued to advance rapidly east of Daxujia. At 6:00 PM, the Qiu and Li Army Groups officially met the Huang Baitao Army Group, which had held firmly in the Nianzhuang area for fourteen days and nights, at Bayiji. The remaining bandits fled south and north.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 23rd] The remaining main force of the Chen bandits fled southwest from between Nianzhuang and Daxujia towards Xiao County on the 23rd.

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 23rd] According to a senior general who told our reporter, the northern advance of our large army groups to reinforce the Xuzhou eastern front will open up the situation. This is the beginning of the second phase of the Xuzhou campaign, and the National Army can continue to reap fruitful results and stabilize the overall situation in this phase. The Huang Army Group bitterly defended Nianzhuang. On the 21st, the communist bandits fiercely attacked the Huang Army Group with a dense network of fire, firing more than 10,000 shells. The fortifications at the Nianzhuang stronghold were almost completely destroyed. The Huang Army Group then moved to a certain position northeast of Nianzhuang to continue to attract the main force of the bandits and annihilate them.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 23rd] The National Army's powerful air force continued to operate on the eastern wing of Xuzhou on the 23rd, cooperating with ground troops to capture the Wangzhuang villages (both front and rear), the Huoshenmiao temples (both front and rear), Hanzhuang, Sunzhuang, Tantou and other places on both sides of Daxujia, which is more than 30 kilometers east of Xuzhou. They also bombed and killed many bandits hiding in fortifications in Sunjiazhuang, Zhangzhuang, Xizhangzhuang south of Nianzhuang, and Caojiacangfang and Huchengwei, three kilometers northwest of Cao Baji.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 23rd] In the afternoon of the 23rd, the air force discovered a group of bandits gathering on both banks of the Sui River, 20 kilometers northwest of Lingbi, and also discovered more than 2,000 bandits fleeing south near the suburbs of Su County. They were subjected to fierce bombing and low-altitude strafing. It is reported that more than 2,000 bandits were killed.

On the morning of the 23rd, the three armies simultaneously moved towards Su County. The Huang and Li Army Groups launched an attack on the Liu bandit's 3rd and 9th Columns facing Su County, approaching the area. The Sun, Li, and Huang three major army groups can then converge. The Xuzhou-Bengbu section of traffic, which has been interrupted for ten days, should be cleared within days. Most of the remaining bandits are fleeing west, and we are dividing our troops to suppress them and expand the results of the battle.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 23rd] The National Army Huang Wei Army Group, crossing the Hui River from northern Anhui, pressed towards Su County on the morning of the 23rd, hoping to meet the Li Yannian Army Group moving north along the Jinpu Railway in Su County and continue to advance north.

### Military Commander Zhou Zhidong Wounded While Supervising Battle Near Nianzhuang Arrives in Nanjing; Scheduled to Fly to Shanghai by Special Plane Today for Treatment

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] General Zhou Zhidong, a military commander of a certain National Army unit who was wounded near Nianzhuang during the Xuzhou campaign, flew to Nanjing from Xuzhou on the 23rd. General Zhou was shot and wounded in his left arm and right leg while personally supervising the battle on the front line. Although he had been fighting continuously and was extremely exhausted, and had just flown, his spirits were excellent. After arriving in Nanjing, General Zhou was escorted back to his residence by relatives and friends to rest, and is scheduled to fly to Shanghai by special plane on the 24th for treatment.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 23rd] The bandit army repeatedly publicized that Zhou Zhidong, the military commander of a certain National Army unit who had been captured, passed through Xuzhou from Nianzhuang this morning and flew to Nanjing by special plane for medical treatment. Commander Liu dispatched Director Guo Yiyu to the airport to see him off. Zhou arrived in Xuzhou from Nianzhuang on the evening of the 20th. According to Qu Zhenyu, the battalion commander who escorted General Zhou safely to Xuzhou, our army was responsible for the western line in the main battle in Nianzhuang. Since the battle began on the night of the 10th, the bandits launched more than ten waves (the bandit's charge was wave-like, each one being a wave) of attacks every night. Therefore, the corpses of bandits piled up like mountains in front of the battle line every night. The intensity of the battle can be imagined. After the bandits were defeated and retreated, he was ordered by the commanders of the Huang and Qiu Army Groups to escort General Zhou to Xuzhou. When the front line was in fierce fighting, the bandits often used small broadcasting stations to shout in front of the battle line, and repeatedly rumored that so-and-so had been killed in battle, and so-and-so had been wounded. Our army repeatedly heard them broadcast that General Zhou Zhitong had been seriously wounded and died, but Zhou was actually personally supervising the battle on the front line at the time. They also broadcasted on the 17th that General Zhou had been captured, and this kind of inflammatory trick by the bandits is proof of the falsehood and arrogance of the bandit's propaganda.

They claimed that they were all forced by the bandits to participate in the battle, and that the column had been completely defeated by us. They also said that although the bandits' surveillance was very strict, there were ways to escape and surrender when the fighting was fierce. Most of those who died in battle in this column were their veteran cadres or those who had been deeply poisoned. Also, when the column participated in the Xuzhou campaign, they changed the designations of their 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Regiments to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Columns, in an attempt to confuse those who heard about it. Commander Sun expressed great satisfaction that the surrendered bandit soldiers were all deeply aware of righteousness and came back with weapons, and personally extended condolences and encouragement.

The Bandit Suppression Headquarters announced the withdrawal process, stating: "After defeating the invasion of Nie Rongzhen's 7th Column and the remnants of the 4th Column, and driving them out for a hundred li, giving them a severe blow and lesson, the National Army in Baoding decided to withdraw from the city of Baoding, and completed this decision calmly on the morning of the 22nd. This is because if a small number of troops are stationed in Baoding under the current circumstances, it will give the communist bandits an opportunity to 'bully the small'. The people in the city will also be threatened by artillery fire and starvation. If the main force of the National Army is placed in Baoding, this part of the force will be frozen. After the National Army's victorious withdrawal from Baoding, it can still re-enter in victory at any time."

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] Students from various schools in Baoding followed the army north along the Ping-Bao Road.

### The Legislative Yuan Resubmits the Proposal to Increase the Prices of Transportation and Public Utilities for Review; Most Members Oppose the Subsidy Policy; The Employee Welfare Fund Regulations Are Passed According to the Amendment

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The Legislative Yuan held its 22nd meeting of the second session on the 23rd, chaired by Chen Lifu. The meeting opened at 9:30 AM. After passing the minutes of the previous meeting and other reports, the meeting proceeded to discuss the following cases: (1) The Labor and Social Affairs Committee reported on the review of the proposal to amend the Employee Welfare Fund Regulations proposed by Huang Jun and others. The resolution was passed according to the amended draft of the review. (2) The Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Committee reported on the review of the draft amendment to the Animal Epidemic Prevention Regulations. It was reclassified as a reporting item, and it was resolved to send it back to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for redrafting before submitting it to the Yuan for review. (3) The Transportation, Economic, and Resource Committees reported on the review of the proposal by Wang Zemin and others that state-owned or public transportation, transportation, postal and telecommunications, and water and electricity enterprises should not arbitrarily increase prices. If necessary, the increase must be approved by the public opinion organs. The review report proposed two points: "1. If state-owned enterprises such as railways, ships, airplanes, postal and telecommunications, and water and electricity must increase prices, they must be approved by the Legislative Yuan. 2. After the above principles are passed by the Yuan, they shall be stipulated in the State-Owned Enterprise Management Law." However, most members expressed opposition to this, believing that the selling prices of state-owned enterprises were too low, so the government had to subsidize them with treasury expenditures. The essence of the subsidy policy is to increase the burden on the entire people for the benefit enjoyed by a few, which is unreasonable. Speakers rose one after another, continuing for two hours. At around 11:00 AM, the hall suddenly lost power. Candles flickered in the darkness. A certain member pointed out that the power company could not bear the burden of losses, resulting in frequent power outages. The consumption of candles actually exceeded the electricity bill dozens of times, emphasizing that low selling prices of transportation and public utilities were not beneficial to the public, and advocating that everything should be rationalized as much as possible. Finally, the entire body passed the resolution without dissent, and the case was resubmitted for review. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. A supplementary meeting was held at 3:30 PM to continue discussing the cases. (4) The Health and Medical Committees reported on the review of the amended draft of the organizational regulations of the Drug and Food Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Health, and the resolution was passed. (5) The Legislative Committee reported on the review of the draft amendment to the Examination Law, and the resolution was passed with amendments. (6) The Legislative Committee reported on the draft examination law for the promotion of civil servants, and the resolution was passed. (7) The Frontier Affairs Committee reported on the review and amendment of the Frontier Political Personnel Reward Regulations, and the resolution was passed with amendments. (8) The Transportation and Legal Committees reported on the review of the draft amendment to the organizational regulations of the Civil Aeronautics Administration of the Ministry of Transportation. The review opinion proposed to retain it, which is the same in nature as (9) Luo Heng and others' proposal to abolish the Civil Aeronautics Administration of the Ministry of Transportation in order to streamline the organization. After combined discussion, most members believed that the Civil Aeronautics Administration had specialized responsibilities and still needed to exist at present. It was resolved to hand it over to the Transportation and Legal Committees for review again under the principle of reducing its staffing. The entire agenda ended at 5:45 PM, and the adjournment was announced.

### Clark Meets with American Reporters; Discusses Plans for Full Support of China; Proposes Actively Using US Military Equipment in the Pacific to Aid Our Country

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Clark, an advisor to the Senate Appropriations Committee who recently visited Asia, told United Press reporters on the 22nd that he personally advocated full support for China and believed that full support for China could save the Chinese government. Clark stated in his official report issued on the 21st that the real decision on whether to fully support China must be made by the US government, not by him.

Clark solemnly pointed out that what he was publishing today was his personal opinion based on his observations while studying the Chinese situation on behalf of the committee. He said that his belief was based on the following three factors: (1) American military aid, strictly supervised by American officials, can effectively utilize China's "almost unlimited manpower". He recommended a training program supervised by American officers overseeing each division and overseeing the strategic participation of each division. (2) Economic aid will stabilize China's currency and consolidate the foundation of China's economy. (3) The American military equipment currently existing in the Pacific can be applied immediately. This military equipment is of utmost value to the Chinese government in this emergency time. The use of this equipment must be ordered by Washington.

Clark further stated that he believed that full support for China was no more warlike than airlifting supplies to Berlin, aiding Greece, or the European aid plan, and no more warlike than the Soviet Union's military and economic aid to Poland, Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and other satellite countries. Clark continued: "In my personal opinion, substantial and effective American aid to support the Chinese government, which has always been so friendly to us, is only similar in nature to the Marshall Plan in Europe. The Marshall Plan aims to stop communism. Therefore, the problem is only in degree, not in nature."

Clark continued that he met with President Chiang during his visit to China and was deeply impressed by President Chiang. "I firmly believe that no matter how things develop, he will fight to the end. I believe that in principle, there is absolutely no thought of compromise in his mind, so he will fight to the end and never surrender. He is a dedicated patriot who will not give up under pressure. I believe that if it had not been for the Japanese invasion, President Chiang would have completed the unification of China."

[Central News Agency, London, 22nd] At a time when the US government is reviewing its China policy today, newspapers here this morning unanimously echoed the suggestion of former US Senator Clark that the United States should provide the Chinese government with appropriate military and financial assistance.

They visited Ambassador Stuart to discuss the matter and met with President Chiang to make a request for instructions. Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiqing, Qin Runqing, Wang Xiaolai and others were unable to come due to other commitments. Accompanied by Xu Xinyu, Qian and his party visited Ambassador Stuart at 12:00 PM, handing over signed letters from university presidents, educational and academic figures in Shanghai, appealing to US President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall to strengthen aid to China, and copies of letters signed by industrial, commercial, banking, and other circles to President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and leaders of the US Congress, appealing to strengthen aid to China. Ambassador Stuart also hosted a luncheon. During the meal, they discussed the actual situation of US aid to China and the future development for a long time.

### Truman and Marshall Discuss US Policy Toward China, Bloom Suggests Inviting President Chiang to the US, US and UK Exchange Views on Chinese Situation

[United Press International, Washington, 23rd] Secretary of State Marshall's personal report to President Truman is expected to be submitted on the 23rd, to expedite important decisions on China.

Marshall mentioned China and other foreign policy issues during a one-hour meeting with the President on the 22nd, as well as at a luncheon meeting with the President and the Cabinet. According to President's Press Secretary Ross, Marshall may return to the White House on the 23rd for further general discussions. Reliable sources predict that future talks will specifically address the issue of potential US aid to the Chinese government, to support the Chinese government in the face of the difficult situation in the fight against the Communists.

Although President Chiang has appealed for US aid to China, it is generally believed that the Administration will not immediately take any active measures to deal with the progress of the Chinese Communists. Officials familiar with the situation list the following factors: (1) US foreign policy in Asia must be re-examined by senior officials, and the views of all friendly governments with strategic interests in Asia will be taken into account during the review. (2) The situation of the Communist Party's offensive from the Northeast into North China must be reassessed to determine whether China can be saved by a large amount of US economic and military assistance. (3) US interests in Europe and China must be carefully weighed to determine whether the United States can effectively extend the Truman Doctrine to China. (4) It is necessary to consult with Congressional leaders to determine their views on China and any expanded aid programs that may arise in the next Congress. One issue that must be considered in advance in the review of policy toward China is President Chiang's request for the United States to declare a policy of sympathy, unity, and support for the Chinese government, to boost morale.

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Informed sources said today that President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall discussed ways to assist China last night. The President is eager to make a decision in order to respond in detail to President Chiang's urgent appeal for expanded US aid. The President and Marshall discussed two main points: (1) Is it too late to help the Chinese government at this moment? (2) Can the cost of an appropriate aid program for China be included in the budget without causing a deficit in the national treasury? It is reported that some government officials are considering an aid program of five billion dollars, but the duration of this program has not been decided, so the amount of aid per year cannot be speculated.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] The Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Bloom, announced that he will request President Truman to invite Chinese President Chiang to Washington to directly discuss the situation in China with the US government.

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] In response to rumors that President Truman plans to send Marshall to China, Ross said today that he has no knowledge of it.

[Central News Agency, London, 22nd, United Press] A British Foreign Office spokesman said that London and Washington are exchanging views on the situation in China.

Editorial

### Establishing Currency Credibility and Maintaining Debt Credibility

The relationship between the government and the people, just like the relationship between people, is based on "trust". Therefore, whether in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad, a good government always prioritizes establishing credibility, so that the people can believe in it, thereby consolidating its political foundation. The story of Shang Yang moving wood to establish credibility is a perfect example. "Those who win the people prosper, those who lose the people perish" is an undeniable truth throughout history; and the key to winning or losing lies in the existence or demise of this "trust". Thousands of years ago, our political thinkers were already loudly proclaiming that "the people cannot stand without trust."

In the past two decades, the government's measures in various aspects have lost credibility with the people too many times. As a result, undeniably, the government's credibility has been declining day by day. However, at a time when it is fearing that it is too late to restore credibility, the "August 19th" currency reform by Wang Yunwu came along. At the beginning of its implementation, the government, as in previous times, reaffirmed its great trustworthiness to the world. The financial authorities, seeing the people, under the dual enticement of sweet words and severe punishment, rushing to send gold, silver, and foreign currencies into the Central Bank, could not but feel complacent and congratulate themselves on their success. However, how long did it take before production shrunk, the economy dried up, and people were in a state of panic across the country, creating an unprecedentedly serious situation. Since the government had made no preparations beforehand, it resorted to haphazard remedies in its desperation, sometimes supplementing, sometimes revising, with the words hardly dry before eating them, almost completely losing the people's confidence. As a result, it further affected the military aspect, with the abandonment of the Northeast and the upheaval in the Jianghuai area, almost shaking the foundation of the country. This painful experience should be a valuable lesson.

Now, Wang Yunwu has already left the scene, and the currency reform has gone from "only allowing success" to ending in "expected failure". The past is not worth dwelling on; however, since the War of Resistance, for more than ten years, the people have suffered from the volatility of the currency system every day, and this time, in particular, the wounds were deep and painful. To win back the people's hearts and restore credibility, the government must thoroughly reform its past policy of following the old ways and repeating itself on the currency issue, which is most closely related to the people's livelihood. The newly appointed Finance Minister Xu Kan, taking office at a difficult time, announced that the first priority of future financial measures is to rebuild currency credibility. We believe that this is a wise and essential move. According to the Central Bank's announcement, the national treasury currently has 5 million taels of gold and 100 million silver dollars, estimated to be able to redeem 12 billion gold yuan. To talk about rebuilding currency credibility at this time is not yet impossible, but it depends on the government's determination in the future.

First, to establish currency credibility, all future financial and economic measures must consider the interests of the people in order to win back the people's confidence. Not to mention the distant past, even in this currency reform, the government's basic motivation was only to solve the financial crisis. Therefore, its implementation methods only focused on broadly opening up financial resources for the government: on the one hand, to facilitate the massive expansion of currency, and on the other hand, to try to defraud the people's gold and silver reserves. Everything only facilitated the government, and no consideration was given to the interests of the people. After 70 days of storms, the people suffered heavy losses, while the government itself, which failed in its policies, temporarily benefited. Such measures that disregard the national economy and the people's livelihood only force the people to more firmly embark on the road of "valuing goods over currency". To demand the consolidation of currency credibility is like going south by driving the chariot north. Also, after the failure of the currency reform, the government's various supplementary and corrective measures inevitably neglected the interests of the majority of the people, but instead allowed a small number of vested interests to benefit, which also goes against the policy of establishing currency credibility.

Second, to establish currency credibility, all future financial and economic measures must have meticulously coordinated plans. The currency issue is linked to the development of the entire financial economy, and it is impossible to isolate it for a solution. Therefore, to establish currency credibility, at the same time, the adjustment of international trade, the encouragement of production enterprises, the regulation of material supply, the stabilization of prices and wages, the balancing of national treasury revenue and expenditure, and the most urgent control of currency issuance, all require comprehensive planning in advance. It is not permissible to be like this currency reform, treating the head when the head aches, and only seeking help from arbitrary political pressure, and instead blaming the people for not trusting the gold yuan. As Finance Minister Xu said well when meeting with reporters: "All future measures of the government must be worthy of the people, and must be carefully considered in advance, and there must be no going back on our words." We hope that this will no longer be an unredeemed check!

In addition to establishing currency credibility, there is also the related issue of maintaining debt credibility. As is well known, financial scholars generally believe that issuing public bonds is a better financial policy than taxation, because taxation is aimed at the general public, while borrowing is to absorb the surplus wealth of the people to make up for the deficit in the national treasury. However, borrowing cannot be done by coercive means, and its success depends on the establishment of a kind of credit similar to that in business, which requires the government to gain the trust of the people. In the past, the government's public bond policy has repeatedly lost credibility with the people, but the people have always maintained a "wait and see" attitude and have tried their best to support it. Later, due to the devaluation of the legal tender, the government issued various foreign currency bonds in order to attract people to purchase bonds. At the beginning of the issuance, the government repeatedly stated that it would do its best to maintain the interests of bondholders. However, as time passed, the government forgot about the people after several revisions and supplements, only considering its own interests. At this time, during Finance Minister Xu's reception, a reporter asked how the government would maintain debt credibility. Xu's answer was: "We will do our best to remedy the situation." We express our regret for Xu's less than sincere response. If the government is sincere in restoring and maintaining debt credibility, it should comprehensively reorganize the public bonds issued in the past. The minimum requirement for legal tender bonds is to reissue new bonds with gold yuan of the same value. US dollar bonds should continue to be valid, and US Treasury bills should also be repaid with principal and interest in accordance with the terms of issuance; and since public bonds are issued by the government, banks and money houses should be allowed to accept mortgages to facilitate turnover. If they are US dollar bonds, holders should be allowed to use them for their children's education expenses. Only in this way can the people restore confidence in public bonds. In the future, if the government has urgent needs, it should not rely on increasing currency issuance to destroy currency credibility, but can continue to issue bonds to replenish funds. Therefore, we hope that when considering how to rebuild currency credibility, do not neglect this important and interrelated link.

The government has repeatedly failed to keep its promises, and the people are tired of hearing them. "Governing lies not in much speaking." Finance Minister Xu stated at the press conference: "If I violate my promises in the future, please feel free to point out and criticize me." We only hope that Xu's situation of being pointed out and criticized will not happen again, because pointing out and criticizing is no longer enough to save the people's confidence, which is hanging by a thread, and the fate of the country, which is in imminent danger.

### Madame Chiang Kai-shek's Full Broadcast to America (Continued from yesterday's first edition · End)

Regardless of the skill of propaganda, facts ultimately speak louder than words. The main theme of the Communist bandits' repeated propaganda is that the government "oppresses" the people, while the Communist bandits are the "liberators." However, the instinctive revulsion of the Chinese people towards the bandits' brutality is sufficient to severely refute the falsity of this propaganda. Today, tens of thousands of people have already, or are in the process of, fleeing from the bandit-controlled areas to the government-controlled areas. The people will surely understand who the real "liberators" are.

You are bound to ask me what kind of assistance the United States can offer to the Chinese government, which is in such a crisis? I want to tell you that, apart from the generous and gratefully received assistance that you have already given to China in the past, the methods and means of assistance must be decided by yourselves. The only thing I want to tell you is that any future assistance must be realized immediately. If communism prevails in China, you will ultimately not be spared, because after the Communist bandits seize China's strategic position, your own strength will also be greatly weakened. If China falls, the entire Asia will inevitably perish with it. Furthermore, the importance of Asia to world peace is certainly no less than that of Europe.

I know that some people in the United States believe that China is neither necessary nor important to the United States, because the United States already has a foothold in Japan. Here, I would like to point out to you a fact: if the vast Chinese mainland is seized by the enemy, the Japanese islands, exposed to the enemy, will inevitably be just a fragile outpost of the United States. This is not a one-sided argument. You may wish to consult your country's military personnel stationed in Japan.

If any of you still harbor the hope of forming a so-called coalition government to make peace with the Communist bandits, then I urge him to carefully consider the essay recently published by the Communist bandit leader Mao Zedong in the organ magazine of the Comintern Information Bureau. The article was broadcast by the Communist bandits' radio station on November 6. I will now quote several paragraphs from it:

"After the victory of the Second World War, American imperialism and its running dogs in various countries, replacing the positions of fascist Germany, Italy, and Japan, are frantically preparing for a new world war, threatening the whole world, reflecting the extreme corruption of the capitalist world and its terror of impending doom…

All revolutionary forces within each country… must unite with each other, form a united front against imperialism headed by the Soviet Union, and follow the correct policies."

When Mao Zedong's power was weak, some of his American advocates persuaded him to pretend that the CCP was just a peasant party. Now that he believes victory is in sight, he has taken off his mask and frankly admits that he is a thorough communist, not only regarding the Chinese government as an enemy, but also regarding the United States as the main enemy. If his current attempts and ambitions to subvert the government succeed, I think Americans will easily understand what his ultimate goal will be.

On February 18, 1943, when we were jointly resisting the threat of the Japanese aggressors, I delivered a speech in the United States Congress. In that speech, there was a passage that best illustrates a truth that inspires our spirit of resistance at this critical moment. I might as well quote it again.

We Chinese people, like you, need a more perfect world, not only for ourselves, but also for all mankind. We must achieve this goal, but it is not enough to merely declare this ideal, or even to think that we already possess it. In order to maintain and safeguard this ideal, we must sometimes exhaust all that we have and strive to achieve it, even at the risk of failure. We Chinese people firmly believe that it is wiser to risk a glorious struggle than to cowardly admit defeat.

This spirit supported us during the most critical period of the War of Resistance. Today, it is also inspiring us. Today's suppression of bandits and pacification of chaos is an extension of our past eight years of long and arduous War of Resistance, but just another chapter in a book. No matter how the changes are, no matter what kind of hardship and suffering the people and the country will endure, our struggle this time will surely be victorious, just like the victory of the War of Resistance, because the goals of the two struggles are the same.

Many sincere friends in the United States have always believed in us in our hardship and distress. I would like to take this opportunity to express China's eternal gratitude.

### Berlin Currency Unification Issue: Four Powers Fail to Reach Agreement; Western Three Powers' Reply Still Not Sent; US Representative Reaffirms Stance, Leaving it to Security Council for Handling

[United Press, Paris, 23rd] The United States delegation to the United Nations General Assembly issued a statement today, reaffirming the United States' position of hoping that the Security Council will resolve the Berlin issue, in order to refute the news spread in Berlin that some authoritative figures in the United States believe that the Berlin issue cannot be agreed upon.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] According to British and American sources here this morning, the three powers' reply to Bramuglia has now been drafted and may be submitted this afternoon. The Soviet Union's reply has been submitted to the United Nations Secretariat. It is reported that the Soviet Union's attitude has not changed. Although American sources do not directly express pessimism about the Berlin issue, they indicate that it is impossible for the four powers to reach an agreement on the Berlin currency issue. It is also said that the main effort of the Western three powers at present is to independently seek a financial plan that will not be deceived by the Soviet Union in the future.

[United Press International, Paris, 22nd] The opinions of the British and French representatives still differ, and the Western allies' reply to the Berlin currency system issue therefore still needs to be delayed. Security Council President, Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, is re-attempting to resolve the Berlin crisis and has raised this issue. The Soviet Union has now submitted a reply, but when the US representative Jessup, the British representative Jebb, and the French representative Barody met on the evening of the 21st to discuss the reply, they could not agree on the wording. They will meet again, hoping to complete the reply at that time, because the differences are relatively minor in nature. Although the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are cooperating with all efforts of the United Nations to resolve the Berlin dispute, their representatives are all pessimistic. It is expected that none of the four powers will change their positions to reach an agreement.

### Based on Bernadotte Plan, Arab-Jewish Provisional Negotiations on Border Demarcation; Australian Representative Proposes to Political Committee

[United Press International, Paris, 23rd] Australian representative Holt suggested on the 23rd that the UN General Assembly approve Israel's membership in the United Nations as soon as possible, and allow the State of Israel and Arab countries to negotiate directly and freely agree on the final boundaries between the two sides. Holt made the above suggestion in the UN General Assembly's Political Committee. He advocated that the United Nations could only send a small mediation committee to assist direct Arab-Jewish negotiations. If the two sides cannot reach an agreement, the issue of the final boundaries of the Holy Land should be submitted to the next General Assembly for a final decision.

This proposal clearly indicates the important policy differences between Australia and the United Kingdom on the Palestine issue. In explaining Australia's proposal, Holt said that direct negotiations between the Arab and Jewish sides could even be held immediately in Paris and supervised by the United Nations. He emphasized that the Holy Land partition plan passed by the United Nations last November should be used as the "basic starting point" for Arab-Jewish negotiations. He said that the United Nations cannot abandon the partition plan.

Arab Representatives Threaten to Withdraw

Egyptian representative Antess Bonli immediately threatened to withdraw Egypt if the State of Israel became a member of the United Nations. The Egyptian representative said that when a person is elected as a member of a general assembly, and this member is disliked by a certain part of the members, then the only thing that a certain part of the members can do is to withdraw, and this is also the only way we can follow. As for what Antess Bonli said, it is not clear whether it was issued by Egypt alone, or by all Arab countries. The seven Arab countries often act as one, especially on the Palestine issue. In general, Egypt has led the Arab countries in the UN General Assembly, and Syria speaks for the Arab countries in the Security Council.

US to Propose Amendments to British Proposals

At the same time, US officials have completed important amendments in an attempt to ease the British Palestinian proposal presented to the Political Committee. Officials said that the amendments will be presented by US Representative Jessup on the 23rd or 24th. According to the British proposal, it is required to support the Bernadotte Plan, which divides the Negev district to the Arabs and the Western Galilee district to the Jews. Officials said that the US amendments will recommend that the United Nations Special Mediation Committee, based on the Bernadotte Plan, encourage direct Arab-Jewish negotiations to agree on their territorial agreements, and avoid adding certain clauses to both parties by the resolutions of the General Assembly. Officials also emphasized that the US amendments were agreed upon with British Palestine experts.

### Balkan Disputes: UN General Assembly President Evatt Meets with Representatives of Four Countries

### Italian and French Prime Ministers Hold Talks

Italy May Join the Collective Defense Treaty

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi arrived in Paris yesterday from Beijing and held talks with French Prime Minister Gouin this morning. It is reported that the issues discussed by the two prime ministers were related to a review of the general international situation. It is speculated in political circles here that Italy may join the future Atlantic Treaty. If so, the seven-nation treaty, originally composed of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, will become an eight-nation treaty with the addition of Italy. Gouin also held talks with Field Marshal Montgomery today on the technical details of the European military organization. Montgomery will stay in Paris until the 25th before returning to England.

### Italian Reparations Warships Prepared for Transfer to the Soviet Union

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 23rd] According to the Italian peace treaty, the commanders of the Italian bases that are to be transferred to the Soviet Union have received an order from the government to prepare completely within forty days for handing over. It is reported that the reason why the Italian government issued this order is due to the results of the recent negotiations between Italian Foreign Minister Sforza and the Soviet ambassador to Italy.

### National Assembly Holds Vote of Confidence; French Cabinet May Survive the Crisis; Senate to Re-elect Speaker Tomorrow

[United Press International, Paris, 23rd] French Prime Minister Gouin has a great deal of confidence in obtaining a vote of confidence from the parliament this afternoon, because the Socialist Party and the Popular Republican Movement have prepared to vote in favor of the government's handling of the 51-day coal miner's strike, but they do not intend to support the passage of Gouin's new tough anti-strike bill.

The labor groups of the Socialist Party and the Popular Republican Movement condemned Gouin's new anti-strike bill on the evening of the 22nd. At the same time, the two labor groups will demand that the legal minimum wage be raised from 12,000 francs to 14,500 francs. The two things currently facing Gouin's cabinet are: (1) the parliamentary vote of confidence in the cabinet; (2) the Senate Speaker election on the 25th. The vote of confidence will focus on the government's handling of the recent communist-led strike. It is generally expected that de Gaulle's extreme right wing will also vote in favor of the vote of confidence. Although the Senate Speaker election is not very serious, the result has an impact. Although the de Gaulle faction does not occupy a majority in the Senate, it is the strongest force.

### British and American Occupation Zones in Germany Crack Czech Spy Ring; Twenty People Arrested and Will Be Prosecuted According to Law

[United Press International, Frankfurt, 22nd] The US Army Department announced that US counterintelligence personnel have cracked a Czech spy ring in the British and American zones of Germany. In this thorough raid, 20 spies were arrested. US headquarters in Heidelberg announced: These Czech spies were arrested on November 9. They will be charged with hostile offenses against the US occupation authorities and will be handed over to the US military government authorities. It is reported that the nationality of the spies is very complicated, but they are all spies acting for the Czechs.

### Syngman Rhee Reiterates Appeal, Requests US Troops to Remain in South Korea; No Matter How Many, It is an Important Guarantee for Korea

[United Press International, Seoul, 23rd] President Syngman Rhee received foreign journalists on the 23rd and reiterated his request that US troops continue to be stationed in South Korea. He requested that the United States guarantee that it would not withdraw US troops from South Korea "until we have established sufficient national defense forces." At the same time, he urged the United Nations to allow US troops to continue to be stationed in South Korea to warn the powerful communist aggressors from Soviet-controlled North Korea. He said: "If the United Nations asks the US military to withdraw, it will not only be a disaster for South Korea, but also a disaster for world democracy." He continued: "I am not asking the United States to fight the Soviet Union in the north. The United States only needs to station a small number of troops as a symbol. This move has a spiritual impact on both the Korean people and the Soviet people. We do not care about 10,000 or 5,000 people. The stationing of US troops is nothing less than a guarantee for the Korean people, and a warning to the Soviet Union." At present, the entire strength of the US troops stationed in South Korea is only one division, but the South Korean government is rapidly training more than 50,000 American-equipped national defense forces, a large number of police, and reserve forces of the same size as the army, as well as coastal security teams.

He announced that because not all of the 50,000 South Korean security forces are loyal and reliable, we have decided to form a 50,000-strong national army. We need to provide them with rifles, and we also need to prepare for a considerable period of time. This is not the time for the United States or the United Nations to decide to withdraw their troops, and if they do so, there will be endless troubles.

[United Press International, Washington, 22nd] According to authoritative sources, senior US officials are concerned that the world will be in a state of international tension for the next decade.

### New Trial Measures for Rice Rationing Accounts: Notation of Rice Store Name on Certificates Expected to Eliminate Panic Buying; This Month's Ration Certificates to Be Distributed Starting Tomorrow

[Our Report] The Municipal Food Allocation Office is implementing a new rice rationing method starting this November. Designated rice stores will be responsible for the distribution, initially piloting the system in the Hongkou, Songshan, and Wusong districts. Following successful trials in these three districts, the system will be extended to all thirty districts of the city in December. The Allocation Office explained the reasons for introducing this new method: Previously, the office allocated quantities of rice to each store based on rough population estimates for each district. After the recent panic buying, some stores were overwhelmed and unable to meet demand, leading to rice shortages, while stores in other areas had few customers. The office believes that improvements are necessary to simplify procedures and avoid panic buying. Under this system, before the 25th of this month, the heads of each bao in the Hongkou, Songshan, and Wusong districts, along with representatives from the rice stores in each bao, will determine the amount of rice needed based on the population within their bao. They will then stamp and annotate the ration certificates with the store name, street name, and house number before distributing them to each household through the baojia heads. Please note: (1) This will be based on the existing household registry from September; (2) Only those with a new National Identity Card will be eligible. After receiving their certificates, residents must fill in the baojia number and household information, as before, and also include their ID card number. They should then bring their ID card (or authorize someone to purchase on their behalf) to the designated store at the beginning of next month to purchase rice. The Food Allocation Office further clarified that previous distributions were based on household registrations from two months prior. The requirement for a September registration ensures that residents have been living in Shanghai for some time, while the requirement for a new ID card indicates that they have not recently left, thus confirming the number of people in the household and preventing inflated reporting. In addition to the Hongkou, Songshan, and Wusong districts, ration certificates for all other districts will also be distributed by the baojia heads, starting on the 25th of this month and continuing until the 30th.

### Jewelry Stores Permitted to Resume Operations First; Agreed Price for Gold Jewelry Set at 2,100 Yuan per Tael

[Our Report] Regarding the application of jewelry stores to resume operations, the Social Affairs Bureau has set a standard for valuing gold jewelry. The price for selling gold jewelry will be based on the Central Bank's listed price, plus a legal profit of 20%, operating expenses of 40%, and labor costs not exceeding 50%, and submitted it to the Gold Control Bureau for approval. It is understood that the Gold Control Bureau has forwarded the proposal to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Pending approval, the jewelry stores are temporarily allowed to operate in accordance with the regulations set by the Social Affairs Bureau, and two important points must be strictly observed during this interim period of resumption of operations: (1) Each jewelry store must uniformly display a sign stating "Selling pure gold jewelry (995 fineness or higher), the price per tael (including labor costs and other expenses) is a total of [amount] gold yuan." For gold jewelry with lower fineness, the jewelry stores must reduce the selling price proportionately based on the actual fineness. Any changes to the prices displayed by the jewelry stores must first be reported to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Gold Control Bureau for approval and must not be changed arbitrarily. (2) The weight and price of each transaction must be accurately recorded in the accounting books, which will be supervised by the Social Affairs Bureau for inspection.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Ministry of Finance to Permit Conversion of Original Gold into Jewelry

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting permission for people to entrust jewelry stores with the conversion of their original gold into jewelry. The telegram stated: The Presidential Order promulgated on November 13th amending the regulations for the handling of gold, silver, and foreign currency held by the people still falls within the scope of "permitting people to hold" these assets. Moreover, the national policy on gold has been revised repeatedly. In February of the 36th year of the Republic, after the Central Bank stopped selling gold, people were still allowed to convert their original gold into gold jewelry. Now that the Central Bank is selling gold, the policy is more relaxed than in February of the 36th year of the Republic. Therefore, people should certainly be allowed to convert their gold or silver into gold or silver jewelry, which is not prohibited. Based on the above reasons, it is requested that your ministry appropriately amend Articles 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the Regulations for the Management of the Purchase, Sale, and Manufacture of Gold and Silver Jewelry, passed at the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on October 27th, so that the jewelry industry has a more abundant source of materials and is not left with no business to operate. Gold and silver that has not been exchanged in rural areas can also be converted into gold and silver jewelry for utilization, which is better than hoarding and is also a way to store wealth among the people.

### Labor Strike in Leather Shoe Industry Resolved Yesterday; Agreement Reached on Two Points, Workers Return to Work; Labor Dispute in Western Clothing Industry Being Mediated; Strike at China Textile Machinery Company

[Our Report] The labor strike in the leather shoe industry in our city was resolved yesterday after mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. The Class A shoemaking workers who had been on strike have agreed to return to work today. The two points agreed upon by labor and management are: (1) Salaries for October will be paid at double the rate. (2) Half of the salaries for the second half of this month will be temporarily borrowed according to the cost of living index of the previous period. The Social Affairs Bureau will submit the requests to abolish tiered discounts and calculate salaries according to the current cost of living index for discussion at the regular meeting of the Labor-Management Appraisal Committee to be held on the 30th of this month.

Workers in the western clothing industry have also recently experienced similar slowdowns. Wages in this industry have always been calculated on a piece-rate basis. Before the cost of living index was restored, each set of clothing was paid a labor cost of 13 yuan, plus a living allowance of 5 yuan 5 jiao. After the government restored the cost of living index method of calculating wages, management intended to cancel the living allowance, while labor requested that the 5 yuan 5 jiao be added to the base salary and calculated along with the index. After submitting the case to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, the workers have voluntarily reduced the 5 yuan 5 jiao to 4 yuan 5 jiao to show their sincerity. Management plans to convene a meeting of the directors and supervisors of the industry association to discuss countermeasures.

Workers at the China Textile Machinery Company borrowed salaries for two months and twenty days (according to the August 19th salary (ten)) before price controls were lifted. After the government restored the cost of living index method of calculating wages, management intended to deduct the previous arrears, first issuing half of the amount. The workers protested and made three demands: (1) The monthly salary of the worker arrested on November 2nd for a certain reason should be paid as usual, and his position should be retained. (2) The previously borrowed monthly salary should not be deducted. (3) Another half-month salary should be borrowed. The factory refused, and the workers went on strike. This dispute is also being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau.

It has arranged with the factory to pay in batches and pick up the goods. Each school should pay the fees to the Personnel Office of the Education Bureau from the 23rd to the 26th of this month, according to the number of people with original purchase certificates in October, at a price of 9 yuan 6 jiao per pound (including laborers). A receipt will be issued first, and each unit can take the receipt and a copy of the general roster (see the announcement board of the Education Bureau for the roster format) to the Personnel Office of the Education Bureau to collect the goods according to the collection date indicated on the receipt. It is also learned that temporary rice ration certificates will be issued this Saturday for the early collection of rice for December by municipal schools. The specific measures will be announced soon.

### Private Elementary School Teachers Request Collective Leave; Mayor Wu Disapproves

[Our Report] The Private Elementary School Teachers Association decided to take a collective leave of absence for one week, starting today. Director Li of the Education Bureau has reported this matter to Mayor Wu, who is said to have instructed the principals to be responsible for not allowing the leave. He also stated that the decision to take a collective leave of absence was only made by a small portion of the private elementary school teachers.

According to the Private Elementary School Teachers Association, they had previously requested emergency relief from the authorities due to the difficult living conditions of their members. Their requests were the same as those of the municipal school teachers and staff, namely, one shi of white rice, two bags of flour, and 500 gold yuan per person. Mayor Wu stated at the time that the teachers and staff could receive subsidies from fees collected from parents. However, Director Li's remarks to the press affected the collection of fees by various schools, and the hope of receiving living subsidies for teachers and staff was dashed. Therefore, the Board of Directors decided to take a collective leave of absence.

### Winter Relief Funding Target Set at 30 Million; Fundraising Meeting Decides on Fundraising Methods

Yesterday, the Shanghai Relief Committee Fundraising Committee held its first fundraising meeting at the Lido Flower Garden. Mayor Wu first reported on two points: (1) The second meeting of the Shanghai Relief Committee resolved that the winter relief work for the 37th year of the Republic in our city will be handled by the Shanghai Relief Committee, and the fundraising will be handled by this committee. A separate winter relief committee will not be established. (2) The symposium convened by the municipal government on October 27th regarding the relief of refugees discussed the fundraising aspect and decided (A) to follow the precedent of the Hankou flood and collect a relief surcharge on customs duties, which requires seeking approval from the central government; (B) to borrow 3 million gold yuan from the Central Bank as an advance payment. An agreement has been reached for the Bank of Communications to borrow 500,000 gold yuan first. Next, Mr. Du Yuesheng presided over the discussion of fundraising targets and methods. The results were as follows: (1) The fundraising target for winter relief this year is set at 20 million to 30 million gold yuan. (2) Mayor Wu, Du Yuesheng, Director Wu, and others will jointly send letters to all levels of automobile owners in our city, requesting voluntary donations. (3) The fundraising committee will regularly invite theatrical performances, famous actors, famous performers, and performing arts groups to hold radio appeals. (4) The fundraising committee will regularly organize various charity ball games with the Sports Association. (5) The leaders of the women's community, baojia leaders in each district, and various groups will be asked to launch fundraising campaigns for winter clothing and used clothing. Fundraising methods will be determined separately. (6) Newspapers and radio stations will be asked to promote the campaign widely. (7) Ticket offices, clubs, famous actors, and theater groups will be asked to voluntarily organize charity performances to raise donations.

### Nanshi Stadium Friendly Football Match: "Northeast Wind" Politely Wins Over Shanghai Police by One Goal

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Sports Association held a friendly football match at the Nanshi Stadium, with the Shanghai Police inviting the "Northeast Wind" team to compete. Although the Shanghai Police's strength was quite weak, the Northeast Wind played extremely politely, winning only by a score of 2-1. In the first half, Northeast Wind led 2-0. Northeast Wind controlled the entire game from start to finish, missing many opportunities, otherwise the score would have been more lopsided. Yesterday afternoon, there were over three thousand spectators, and the atmosphere was quite lively.

Yesterday, Northeast Wind benefited greatly from the presence of Tan Fuzhen at the rear guard, making the defense much more solid. The forwards were able to use both wings to attack, tiring out the Shanghai Police. The Shanghai Police's defense was too poor, and their goal area became a scene of utter panic. The Shanghai Police presented flowers before the start of the match, and the referee was Fang Rongfu. The Shanghai Police attacked first, with great momentum, but failed to score. Northeast Wind counterattacked, causing alarms throughout the Shanghai Police's goal area. Northeast Wind continued to attack fiercely, and finally, at 35 minutes, Xia Shufu, on the right wing, crossed the ball, Jiang Kun missed it, and Wang Burong caught up and shot it in. In less than three minutes, Jiang Kun scored the second goal, giving Northeast Wind a clean 2-0 lead in the first half.

In the second half, the Shanghai Police counterattacked, but missed opportunities near the goal. At five minutes, Ma Qingyuan handled the ball, resulting in a penalty kick. Northeast Wind did not press their advantage and did not use full force, resulting in a missed penalty. The Shanghai Police's fortunes turned around, and one minute later, Yuan Kuntian dribbled past Li Chengxian and scored, pulling back one goal. The final score was 2-1.

Northeast Wind:

Yan Chengkuan, Zheng Bing, Tan Fuzhen, Wu Kaimin, Wang Baoshan, Li Chengxian, Wang Burong, Jiang Kun, Zhang Jiliang, Chen Qin, Xia Shufu

Shanghai Police:

Kan Jing, Ma Bingzhang, Ma Qingyuan, Gu Zhenji, Xu Zhongfa, Dai Wende, Zhang Zhen, Shi Jiuquan, Liu Zhufeng, Yang Yimin, Yuan Kuntian

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday, the Donghua Football Team played a friendly match against the new army Zhenxing Team at the Jiaotong University stadium, with nearly a thousand fans watching. Zhenxing had less experience, and within five minutes, Donghua's right wing Guan Yongchang scored a goal. It wasn't until 30 minutes that Xi Yulong broke the net, making the score 1-1 at halftime. In the second half, Zhenxing switched to an offensive, but Donghua did not relax. At 12 minutes, Qian Yunqing kicked in a goal, and within two minutes, Han Longhai scored another, resulting in a 3-1 victory for Donghua. Donghua was originally scheduled to play against Zhonghang today, but due to the need for rest, it has been postponed.

### Zhang Renyou and Others' Corruption Case: The District Court Reopens the Trial Yesterday. All Witnesses Testified in Detail Regarding the Extortion, Occupation, and Concealment Portions.

[Our Dispatch] The case of former Water Police Branch Chief Zhang Renyou and nine others, accused of corruption and dereliction of duty, was reopened yesterday afternoon by Judge Guo Zugan of the District Court. Regarding the portion where Zhang Renyou was accused of extorting property, Wu Delin, manager of the New Fuxin Shipping Company, stated that the company's ship had an accident on March 16th due to a damaged winch, causing timber to fall and kill a worker named Yang Qing. Afterwards, the Water Police Branch detained the ship's engineer Wang Wengao, and he sent the company's general affairs director Guo Liangzhen to the station to inquire. As a result, after bailing out Wang and Guo, they directly paid the family of Yang Ji, the deceased worker, a compensation of 180 million legal tender and 5 million for lawyer's fees. The family of the worker then voluntarily withdrew the lawsuit from the Water Police Branch, reaching a settlement. Besides this, no payments were made to other parties.

False Reporting of 700 Gallons of Diesel Fuel

Witness Chen Shaoxi (former general affairs staff of the Water Police Branch) testified in court regarding the portion where defendants Zhang Renyou, Huang Boqian, and others were accused of embezzling public property: He was in charge of receiving, distributing, and reporting fuel, ammunition, clothing, etc. for the branch. The branch had an eight-horsepower speedboat, which was damaged and taken out of service on March 8th this year after being hit by a customs vessel. After learning of this upon taking office, Chief Zhang sent a letter of negotiation. However, under the orders of Section Chief Huang, the diesel fuel used by the boat was still falsely reported as before. Although he knew it was a false report at the time, he had no choice but to comply with the Section Chief's orders. After work each day, the key to the oil depot would be opened and handed over to others for safekeeping. He did not know whether it was being stolen and sold. Later, after someone secretly reported it, Chief Zhang ordered Section Chief Huang to find a way to correct it with the General Bureau. Section Chief Huang said that there were many leaks in the diesel barrels, and the inflated figures were intended to make up for the losses. Within just two months, the false reports amounted to 710 gallons. In addition, the seized coal stored at the station in April and May of this year suddenly disappeared. Later, after investigation, it was discovered that Section Chief Huang had sold it and received 3 million, which he refused to accept.

Changing Fines Without Sending to the General Bureau

Regarding Tan Wenxi and others' US dollar transactions, and the portion where Zhang Renyou was accused of dereliction of duty and concealment, witness Shen Huanling (former first section chief of the Water Police Branch) testified that the Balle Automobile Company had illegally built a wooden kiosk at Wharf No. 10 on the Bund to conduct business for American soldiers on leave. After Officer Luo of the branch investigated, he felt that the proposed punishment was too lenient, so he separately signed an opinion proposing detention for two days as a warning. Regarding the US dollar transaction portion, he intended to send it to the Economic Section of the General Bureau for review. After submitting it to Chief Zhang, he approved it with "Okay." Subsequently, Chief Zhang directly ordered Officer Luo to cancel the previous proposal, changed the punishment for the Balle Company owner to a fine, and did not send it to the General Bureau either. In court, he asked Zhang Renyou why he made these changes. He replied that he did not know, and claimed that this was an administrative punishment and that the chief had the right to make changes.

Many witnesses, including Deputy Chief Yan Shaobai of the Water Police Branch, personnel administrator Fei Dingsen, Officer Li Youkun, and Texaco employee Cao Yusheng, were also summoned yesterday, but none of them appeared in court. The court then questioned the defendants Zhang Renyou, Huang Boqian, Xia Zhemin, and Xie Yiyun one by one. Since the important witnesses were not all present, the court ordered a postponement for retrial. Zhang Renyou's request for bail was denied, and he was returned to custody. The other five defendants who were out on bail were not summoned yesterday.

### Private School Principals Request Four Points: The Education Bureau Especially Decides to Distribute Rongshen Yarn and Rice in Advance.

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon, representatives from the private elementary school principals' associations of various districts in the city, including Yan Guodong, Feng Yagu, Yu Xian, Wang Shiying, Ji Yangbing, Qian Jimin, and Tao Yayu, visited Education Bureau Director Li to request relief for the private school teachers and staff who were unable to maintain their livelihoods due to their difficult living conditions. Director Li, along with Section Chief Zhu and Section Chief Liu, met them cordially and discussed the matter. The representatives from each district put forward four requests: (1) Request that the Education Bureau allow each private school colleague to receive one pound of Rongshen yarn. (2) Request permission for each school to collect a living subsidy fee from teachers and staff. (3) Request permission to transfer the November and December allocation of four dou of specially allocated rice to teachers and staff in advance to the People's Food Allocation Committee. (4) Request permission to allocate confiscated materials. Director Li and Section Chief Zhu replied as follows: (1) It has been decided that private school teachers will be allocated one pound of Rongshen yarn, and the Taibureau will negotiate with the Social Bureau to issue vouchers for allocation. (2) The bureau had already approved each school to discuss collecting a teacher's living subsidy or welfare fund with students' parents. It is hoped that mandatory regulations will not be set. (3) Regarding the allocation of rice, the bureau will negotiate with the People's Food Allocation Committee to allocate it in advance. (4) The quantity of confiscated materials is not as large as rumored outside. How to distribute them will be decided after verification. He also encouraged each principal to consider the difficult times. If there are other difficult situations, they can report to the bureau for consultation and resolution.

### The Executive Yuan Approved the Implementation of Water and Electricity Conservation Measures: Ordering All Factories to Provide Universal Supply and Prohibiting the Installation of Neon Lights

[Our Dispatch] The Ministries of Interior, Industry and Commerce, and National Defense have jointly drafted measures for urban water and electricity conservation in order to strictly enforce water and electricity conservation in cities. The measures have been approved by the Executive Yuan and will be implemented. In addition to instructing the Public Utilities Bureau to comply, the municipal government has also issued orders to its departments to be informed. The main points of the measures are as follows: (1) All water and electricity plants should provide universal supply to users who apply for installation for legitimate purposes in accordance with regulations. Any extortionate behavior will be dealt with as corruption. (2) From the date of promulgation of these measures, electrical users are prohibited from installing neon lights. Those who have already installed them are not allowed to use them after 10:00 PM. Those who violate this will have their electricity supply suspended. (3) Local military, government, police, and gendarmerie agencies should pay fees in accordance with the preferential measures set by the water and electricity plants. If there is theft of water or electricity in the office buildings and employee, soldier, and police dormitories of these agencies, or in the private residences of their subordinates, the water and electricity plants will handle the matter according to the procedures they have set after verification. If necessary, the name of the agency or the user's name will be publicly announced to impose strict sanctions on their reputation and public opinion. (4) From the date of implementation of these measures, water and electricity companies in each city should complete rectification within three months. They may not stop the supply of all or part of the water and electricity unless there are special reasons that have been verified and approved by the competent authorities.

### Liu Zhixiong Sentenced to Life Imprisonment for Stabbing His Aunt to Death and Attempting Suicide

[Our Dispatch] Liu Zhixiong was sentenced to life imprisonment yesterday by the District Court for stabbing his aunt to death with a military knife and attempting suicide. Liu Zhixiong and Liu Yintang were cousins through their shared grandfather. Yintang was promoted by Zhixiong's father, Liu Ruxiang (the bogus China Reserve Bank's Business Bureau Director), and his family's financial situation gradually improved. After Ruxiang was imprisoned, Zhixiong's family's financial situation declined, and he suffered from lung disease. Last December, he needed money for medical treatment and borrowed money from Yintang. Yintang agreed to bear the medical expenses, but did not agree to lend the money. After Zhixiong had surgery in the hospital, Yintang suddenly regretted his promise and did not lend the money. At the end of April this year, Zhixiong was financially distressed and returned home from the hospital to recuperate. At 8:45 AM on September 8, carrying a hand grenade, he went to Yintang's residence on Bixun Road and encountered Liu. His attitude was fierce. Yintang's wife, Xiao Wenru, saw that the situation was not good and immediately hugged Zhixiong, allowing Yintang to escape. Zhixiong then pushed Xiao down and threw the hand grenade at Yintang, which exploded on the spot. Yintang escaped quickly and was not injured. Zhixiong entered the room and stabbed Yintang's mother to death with a military knife. He then used the knife to cut his own throat and fell to the ground. The police were notified and sent officers to the scene. Zhixiong had not died and was sent to the hospital for treatment. The case was then transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution.

### Extension of Increase in Capital of Financial Firms: All Deadlines Extended to the End of December

[Our Dispatch] The Ministry of Finance previously received a joint telegram from the Shanghai Banking, Money Lending, and Trust Associations, stating that the Shanghai market's funds were extraordinarily tight and explaining the difficulties in increasing capital. They requested that the deadline for increasing capital be extended. To sympathize with the merchants' difficulties, the Ministry of Finance has recently approved that the deadline for increasing capital of financial firms in various regions should be calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Legal Enforcement Date Limit Regulations. Those that were originally scheduled to end before the end of December of this year are all approved for an extension to the end of December of this year. All financial firms must complete the procedures within the deadline and must not delay any further. After receiving the above telegram order, the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau issued orders to the Banking, Money Lending, and Trust Associations yesterday to transfer them to all financial firms for compliance.

It is also learned that, among the banks in Shanghai, only two or three have completed the capital increase procedures so far.

### The Rice Market is Stable

The trend of the rice market yesterday was to rise first and then fall back, ending even with the previous day's prices. The total amount of goods arriving on the market yesterday was 6,511 dan and 5 dou, which was quite a large amount. The opening price of Nanshi white japonica rice was shouted out at 440 yuan. Rice merchants made purchases at low prices, and the price rose sharply to 460-470 yuan. After midday, prices fell back due to the tight money market, and the closing price was similar to the previous day. Nanshi white japonica rice was 450 yuan, and Beishi was 480 yuan. The price of Nanshi and Beishi thin rice was 450 yuan, the price of Nanshi early rice was 425 yuan, and the price of Beishi was 420 yuan. The price of sheep rice in both cities was 440 yuan.

The price of flour fell yesterday. The factories were selling a lot, but the merchants were not strong in their purchases. The customers were watching the trend. The price of old vehicles was 154 yuan, the price of military ships was 146 yuan, and the price of Fuxin's large-package wheat bran was 92.5 yuan, down 4-5 yuan from the previous day.

The supply and sales of edible oil were balanced yesterday. The market fluctuated slightly and rose slightly compared to the previous day. Jiangbei Jituo raw oil was still 1,040 yuan, this factory's soybean oil was 800 yuan, up 50 yuan, sesame oil was 850 yuan, also up 50 yuan, and vegetable oil was 690 yuan, up 60 yuan.

The price of miscellaneous grains rose and fell yesterday. Hankou broad beans were 180 yuan, Pinghu small coarse beans were 220 yuan, Yangzhou raw peanuts were 480 yuan, Qidong corn was 155 yuan, and Datong bean cakes were 70 yuan.

### The Foreign Exchange Market Resumes Trading

[Our Dispatch] Foreign exchange transfer certificates began trading yesterday. The asking price in the morning was 25 yuan, then it increased to 26 yuan, and finally returned to the original price of 25 yuan, where someone bought it. The volume of transactions yesterday was not large. Each designated bank only traded 10,000 to 20,000 US dollars. It is estimated that the total transaction volume was about 300,000 to 400,000 US dollars.

### Export Incentives are Still Needed After the Announcement of New Foreign Exchange Measures

Although import and export industries feel excited after the announcement of the "Import and Export Linkage Outline" and "Regulations for Managing Foreign Exchange Transactions", according to an exporter, most of the foreign exchange needed for imports in the future will rely on exports. Therefore, imports can only increase when exports increase. However, there are still difficulties in exporting at present. (1) The procurement areas for export materials are now much smaller than before due to the changing situation, and the supply has become sparse. (2) After the foreign exchange earned from exports is exchanged for transfer certificates at designated banks, exporters' capital turnover will be difficult if they cannot sell them immediately. (3) The domestic financial situation is unstable, and interest rates are too high. When funds are tight, lending rates are around 10%. There are also many surcharges for remitting funds to production areas to purchase materials. A remittance to Chongqing a week ago only received 600 yuan per 1,000 yuan, not including the interest expense. Exporters have too much of a burden when transferring funds. (4) There is a shortage of domestic materials, and prices are still high. There are still few commodities that can be exported profitably. For example, the selling price of wool in the production area is 800 gold yuan per dan. After deducting 15% loss during transport to Shanghai, the cost per dan is about 1,000 gold yuan, plus 20% for water transportation and freight, the cost is 1,200 gold yuan (excluding interest and remittance charges). The selling price of wool abroad is 25 cents USD per pound, so one dan should be 28 USD. Even at 30 gold yuan per USD, it is only 840 gold yuan, so exporting would still result in a loss of 40%. The same situation applies to other items such as raw silk, tea leaves, and sausage casings. If the government wants to increase imports now, it must incentivize exports; otherwise, exports will remain limited under the current circumstances.

### The Money Market is Apparently Relaxed but Actually Tight

Cash on the market still felt tight yesterday, especially large bills of 20, 50 and 100 yuan, which were very scarce. It is said that, in addition to withdrawals of deposits, the vigorous search by Hong Kong and Guangdong merchants who have recently arrived is also a major reason. As for the trend of the money market, it appeared to be relaxed but was actually tight yesterday. Although turnover felt flexible, call loans were high. There were transactions at 30 yuan, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of about 6-9%. Many industry financial firms were still offering bills in the form of short-term borrowing.

According to news from the Central Bank's domestic exchange department, in the past week, the inflow of funds into Shanghai from other regions has exceeded the outflow from Shanghai by an estimated ratio of 1 to 2. This is because the remittance charges from Shanghai to various regions are very high and some regions have limits.

### Yarn and Cloth Prices Decline Slightly

The yarn market saw sluggish sales from both local and external buyers yesterday. The conversion price for gold by the Central Bank was lower than the general price, so speculative funds shifted their target. Because there had been a strong rise the previous day, speculators were selling heavily and traders actively purchased, resulting in supply exceeding demand. Although 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn once rose to 11,500 yuan, as closing approached, many sellers rushed to sell, and the asking price fell back slightly to close at 11,000 yuan, down 100 yuan from the previous day. The forward price was 11,300 yuan. 21-count Double Horse yarn also rose by 100 yuan at one point, but finally closed at 7,900 yuan, down slightly by 100 yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarns also fell by 100-200 yuan, with quite light trading.

In the cotton cloth market, prices were inverted. The prices of cloth in places such as Changsha, Hankou, and Wuhu were all lower than in Shanghai. Cloth shops on this street were not actively purchasing. Shop business was slow because prices were high and citizens' purchasing power had greatly declined. Therefore, there was no smooth purchasing, and many speculators lacked support and rushed to sell. The opening asking price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 10 yuan higher than the previous day, but as speculators competed to sell, it gradually declined to 370 yuan for sale, and then fell to close at 365 yuan, down slightly by 5 yuan from the previous day. Sales of Four Gentlemen Yuan serge were limited, and it also fell slightly by 5 yuan to 360 yuan. 190 high-end Shilin cloth was offered at 700 yuan. 390 American Pavilion Shilin cloth was priced at 760 yuan, and its trend was also sluggish. There were no significant changes for other cloths.

### Broadcloth Sales Become More Active

Broadcloth sales are gradually becoming more active. Retail business in shops on Qipan Street has improved daily compared to last week. Yesterday, the wholesale price of Yinfeng Zhanghua tweed on the market was 250-260 yuan per yard, Shanghai Double Cat brand tweed was 275 yuan, Xiexin Yuanfeng was 290 yuan, Zhongfang 1830 and 1831 Tibetan thick serge were both sold at 175 yuan, Double Deer flowered western cloth was sold at 14 yuan, and Kai 277 French shirt was 6.5 yuan. External sales have not yet developed.

### Silk is All Selling Well

Rayon is strong. Although the firms' cash positions are slightly tight, people are optimistic because the CITIC Bureau has not allocated any for a long time, and asking prices continue to rise. The initial opening price for 120 Tianqiao was 11,000 yuan outside of customs, directly approaching 12,000 yuan. Afterwards, prices from outside reported declines, and the closing price was 11,600 yuan, up 1,100 yuan. D-grade factory silk was offered at 14,500 yuan, up 1,000 yuan. Dacheng quilt covers were also boosted to 7,600 yuan, up 300 yuan.

### Little Trading for Export Tea

Although foreign tea firms, which had been quiet for a long time, were inquiring, the difference between their ideal prices and the sellers' was too large, and trading fell into stagnation again. Judging by the situation, there is little prospect of a breakthrough in the short term. As for tea for domestic sales, since the lifting of price controls, prices have increased several times, but sales in this street and other places have not weakened at all. The process has been active, and the price is changing all the time as the owners move their asking prices, showing improvement every day.

### Sugar Sales are Sluggish and Allocations are Reduced

The Shanghai Office of Taiwan Sugar Corporation announced its 30th quotation and allocation of Taiwan sugar yesterday (the 23rd). The number of sugar merchants applying was not crowded. This was due to the recent sluggish domestic sales and the limited actual sales in the city. Therefore, the sugar market has been weak for days. It is reported that the total amount of Taiwan sugar allocated today was less than 5,000 bags, a decrease of about three-quarters compared to the previous period.

### Foothills of the Qilian Mountains: Military Pasture

— Our Reporter, Song Lin

[Our Newspaper Lanzhou Dispatch, 10th] The Qilian Mountains, stretching over two thousand li, have vast pastures both inside and outside the mountains. Such as the Babian Zhi Ebo and Ersi Tan, the Laohugou Tan and Gengaer Tan of the headwaters, the Dongxi Haizi of Gaotai, the Guanpo Kanglong Temple of Zhangye, the Daheba and Damaying of Shandan and Yongchang, and the Songshan of Yongdeng. Everywhere, the green grass is like a carpet. Even in the depths of the mountains, the harvested grass is extremely lush, truly a natural area for animal husbandry. In Damaying of Shandan and Songshan of Yongdeng, there are military ranches, all under the jurisdiction of the Northwest Horse Administration Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. In this period of suppressing rebellion and building the nation, all departmental endeavors must be properly coordinated. The military ranches also undertake the task of cultivating military horses. Horses are an important part of the military organization, especially on the plateaus of the Great Northwest. The establishment of iron cavalry is even more significant and essential.

Damaying in Shandan

The Shandan Military Ranch is located in Damaying, more than fifty kilometers from Shandan County. This location is located on the Yin side of the Qilian Mountains and the Yang side of the Dahuang Mountains, an area for stationing troops and raising horses throughout the dynasties. The area is over six thousand square li. Nearby villages are sparse, and the green fields are boundless. The ranch has simple office facilities. The horse herd managers live in tents. On the grassland, the wind comes like green waves surging, and the tents scattered everywhere are like small boats drifting with the wind.

The ranch is managed by Shi Tinggui, a young cavalry officer, who leads more than a thousand officers and soldiers, pushing forward the business diligently on the windy and sandy plateau. The ranch currently has four herds of military horses, about twelve thousand horses. They live in this place with inconvenient transportation and sparse population, living with horses all year round, and there is no sense of loneliness. The ranch has attached bathhouses, libraries, sports grounds, Qin opera gardens, children's schools, and cooperatives to seek stability and satisfaction in the lives of officers and soldiers.

Work and Improvement

The main work of the pasture is the breeding, training, and breed improvement of military horses. Although the ranch has dense grass, it has not been scientifically managed. Their agricultural and animal husbandry technicians are engaged in the collection and analysis of the original wild grass to test its nutritional value, as a basis for retention and elimination. On the other hand, they collect world pasture varieties and test planting as a guideline for promotion and improvement.

After the mares grow for three years, those who do not need to be reserved for breeding are all castrated, and the team training begins. After a considerable period of taming, they become reserve military horses, waiting to embark on the expedition. The horses here are mainly of the Northwest Mongolian breed, crossbred with the famous Ili breed of Xinjiang, which is indeed taller and stronger than the original. In the near future, a batch of American Morgan stallions will be transferred from Tianjin to improve the ancient Mongolian breed.

Yongdeng Military Ranch

Another military ranch is the Yongdeng Military Ranch, located in Manzhouying of Songshan, Yongdeng County. As the name suggests, this was a military camp during the Manchu Qing Dynasty. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Prince Su was defeated by the Qing army here and never recovered, causing the Qing army to directly attack the entire city (now Lanzhou), advance to Xi'an, and capture Tongguan, and the Ming Dynasty perished. The military value of this place is already imaginable, so the establishment of a camp here by the Qing court was of great significance.

The terrain of the ranch is flat, a vast grassland, seemingly boundless in the distance. Although the pasture grass shows a slight depletion phenomenon this year due to drought and dryness, the herds of military horses are very strong. The ranch currently has six herds of horses, a total of one thousand four hundred horses. Among them, there is a herd of mares left over after Japan surrendered, transported here, and crossbred with famous breeds from Ili, Australia, etc., and many new breeds have been produced.

New Force on the Plateau

The ranch manager is Zhu Junjie, who has been engaged in horse administration for many years, leading three to four hundred people on the plateau at an altitude of more than 2,600 meters, cultivating a mobile iron cavalry force for the country.

The Director of the Northwest Horse Administration Bureau once told reporters: In the future, these military ranches will be working schools, management will be militarized, life will be familialized, operations will be scientized, and handling affairs will be rationalized. Their only hope, as a group of unsung heroes, is to lay the foundation for China's horse administration through their hard work!

### Democracy

— Wu Yong

The resentment expressed by people today indicates, on the one hand, an underestimation of their own strength, and on the other hand, an overestimation of the strength of others. The person who is most full of resentment today is actually the one who is most dependent on others and most reveres others as gods. Today, we all say that democracy is good, but we do not know that this kind of resentful mentality is contrary to the spirit of democracy. Democracy means that the majority of people exert power; the focus is on each individual, not on a part of the people. Resenting only shows laziness and uselessness, and has nothing to do with democracy.

Democracy is like acting in a play. The leading role is important, but the supporting roles and extras are also important. Even those who play the qin, beat the drums, and strike the coins must cooperate properly so that the performance can be compact and exciting. In a democratic play, there should be no spectators in the audience. The entire theater is the stage, and the spectators are the actors. The actors are the spectators. Whether the performance is good or bad cannot be blamed on the leading role alone. But thinking about our country, there have been sages and perfect people, heroes and outstanding individuals throughout the ages. These outstanding talents are superior to the average people of any country today, but what use is it for our country to have these few sages, perfect people, heroes, and outstanding individuals? What impact has it ever had on the general public's intelligence and morality? Confucius and Mencius were indeed sages and virtuous, but in reality, it was as if they had never existed. Conversely, looking at a civilization like the United States, haven't there been corrupt officials, heinous thieves, and traitors? However, it still does not hinder its democracy and civilization, only because it is like a clear river. Occasionally, garbage is poured in, and it quickly sinks to the bottom of the river, which does not hinder the water from being clear. It is evident that relying on one or two sages and two or three heroes alone is not of much use. What is important is that the majority of people can practice what they preach. Even if there are two or three chief culprits and great evils in a country, it does not matter much, as long as the majority of people do not cooperate with them and reject and despise them. No matter how heinous they are, they will only be like a turtle turned on its back, and they will definitely have no way to implement their plans.

Furthermore: We all say that China's officialdom is corrupt and dark, and this is naturally undeniable. It's just that we seem to divide the boundary between officials and the people too clearly, as if officials and the people are two completely different animals. Hu Shi's Collected Works quotes The Seven Heroes and Five Gallants: "...Call the names in order, and when they arrived at the Imperial River, everyone did their work according to their rank. Master Zhi took a shovel and scooped up more than anyone else, and threw it farther and faster. The workers next to him said: 'Wang the Second, this is not how you do this work.' Master Zhi said: 'How?' The people next to him said: 'As the saying goes: the emperor's work, do it slowly. If you do it like this, can you eat for a long time?' Master Zhi said: 'If I do it slowly, will they give me food?' The people next to him said: 'It's the same if you do it slowly, will he not give anyone food?' Master Zhi said: 'If that's the case, I'll do it slowly.'" This teasing is true. But are these people who are working for the emperor officials or people? In fact, the other so-called officials are just as the saying goes: put on a cassock and you are a monk, take off the cassock and you are still a layman? "Dragon seed" is really a deceptive statement, and officials do not have "official seed." In that case, why should we who demand democracy set up barriers ourselves?

Therefore, instead of yelling empty slogans, it is better to get up and participate in the play. Otherwise, I'm afraid today will be in vain, and tomorrow will still be in vain. Don't say I didn't warn you.

### The Revolution of the Telephone

— Ting Zhi

Since its invention, the telephone has changed many times, but a newly invented telephone has a more important reform, which can be said to be a revolution in telephones. The appearance of the new telephone is similar to a small radio, and the volume can be adjusted freely, with "jacks." Anywhere, as long as the "jack" is plugged in, you can make a call, and the other party's voice has been amplified, just like talking to you in the room. This new telephone can eliminate the fatigue of holding the handset, and allows the person listening to the phone to work with both hands at the same time, and it doesn't matter if you walk around in the room.

### Talking About Business Trips

— A Dan

Central and local agencies dispatch personnel to work outside the office for inspection, investigation, meetings, handover, survey, purchase, transportation, escort, and other necessary tasks. This is called a business trip. Public officials regard business trips as a hard chore, some as a good job, not necessarily. It only depends on where the business trip is to, and whether one understands the tricks of the trade.

The so-called hard chore is because of the constraints of the business trip allowance. Currently, a business trip costs ten yuan per day for senior positions, eight yuan for recommended positions, six yuan for appointed positions, four yuan for attendants, and two yuan for workers. This amount includes the cost of meals, accommodation, and miscellaneous expenses for one day. Transportation such as trains and ships also has regulations: first class for senior positions, second class for recommended and appointed positions, and third class for attendants and workers. Special expenses are reimbursed based on actual expenses, and special expenses require receipts as proof.

The 10 yuan per day meal and accommodation allowance for senior positions is definitely not enough. The regulation is to report two days for one day, and four or five days for two days to compensate. The superior and the accounting office (department) know this and do not investigate, because it is impossible to reimburse otherwise.

As for those officials with status on business trips, there are no restrictions on special expenses. In this way, not only do they not lose money, but they also make money. Some even use the name of business trips to go abroad or return to their hometown for a trip, or to purchase goods in a single-gang style to make a profit. This depends on his skills.

The so-called business trip is a good job because they have many tricks, such as arriving at a certain place and talking about the local specialties with the local主管, intentionally or unintentionally, such as Jinhua and Xuanwei ham, Qimen Wuyi Hangzhou tea, Taiwan grass mats and fruits, Guangdong black rubber gauze silk, Shandong white silk, Hunan and Sichuan summer cloth, Jilin ginseng, clam, Northwest carpets, Zhangjiakou mushrooms, Jiangxi porcelain, Duanzhou Huizhou inkstones, etc., they can send a large amount of them. If they say that the hotel is noisy, there are many bedbugs, and it is inconvenient to live and eat, they will be welcomed to live in the agency or guest house, which will save a lot of meal and accommodation expenses. Thinking of sightseeing or other entertainment, someone will guide and accompany them to do whatever they want.

If it is to investigate the disaster situation, if they slightly reveal that the disaster situation here is not serious, they will try to flatter you and ask you to emphasize the severity of the disaster and the vastness of the area in the report. Because in this way, you can get more relief funds and be exempted from some land tax. Otherwise, if the disaster situation is minor, then you will not get any benefits. To draw an analogy, you can cite the rest.

Although the laws and regulations stipulate that officials on business trips cannot accept local hospitality, this is a formality. In fact, it is the opposite. A person on a mission on a business trip is often entertained by all parties, often causing stomach problems and insomnia. Coming back from a business trip, they are mostly fully loaded, and his report does not have to be written by himself. Someone will write a magnificent book for him.

Who says a business trip is not a good job!

### Loneliness

— Zhi Bai

The French legal scholar, Chateaubriand, stated, "The greatest emotion is silence and loneliness." Why is this so? It's because words lack spirit, and cannot express one's heart in the slightest. Chinese language teachers often comment on students' papers, saying "words fail to convey the meaning," but they do not realize that the mind is like a monkey and a horse, changing a thousand times in an instant. How can these dull and rigid words fully reveal it? Westerners emphasize the importance of imagery, association, and the "fluidity" of words in poetry, all of which understand the intention of expressing meaning beyond words. The beauty of "Several Green Peaks on the River" is also based on this principle.

Chinese people often say, "One can only speak to those who understand," and "What is valued in mutual understanding is understanding each other's hearts." If one can understand each other without words, why bother with them? It is precisely because they cannot have a tacit understanding that they must leave behind these few lines of text and leave these traces, and the original intention is lost. Now, there are talented people who cannot forget their emotions and fall into the clutches of demons. They pile up these stubborn stones into a Bagua formation to wait for a sympathetic person in the future. If the person they are waiting for arrives, they will only understand it silently and leave, while the talkative people will gather around this pile of stones, gesticulating wildly, spitting everywhere, and talking nonsense about what they have heard, seen, and imagined.

The greatest joy is speechless, and the greatest sorrow is also speechless. Being able to understand others in silence is perhaps gradually entering the right path.

### Introducing "A Brief History of China"

— Chu Yukun

The Chinese nation is the oldest nation in East Asia. Not only was it the first to be civilized, with five or six thousand years of glorious history, but its culture and artifacts were also prosperous. Whether it be in literature, philosophy, politics, economics, or law, everything was quite impressive. However, in recent years, due to the gradual eastward expansion of European and American trends, the majority of people are infatuated with the material civilization of Europe and the United States. Some people even advocate for a complete Westernization of their own way of life. This sense of inferiority is not only inexplicable to Chinese people, but also to Europeans and Americans.

However, knowledgeable people in the United Kingdom and the United States do not underestimate the five or six thousand years of culture of the Chinese nation because of the inferiority of the Chinese people. On the contrary, the United States, which has developed its material civilization to the extreme, is most able to appreciate our long-standing Chinese culture. For example, Progressive Party leader Henry Wallace wants to emulate the "New Deal" of Wang Anshi, a great politician of the Song Dynasty in our country. The US Department of Agriculture has also sent many experts to study our country's traditional experience in cultivation to provide reference for the improvement of agriculture in the United States. The mystery of traditional Chinese medicine has aroused infinite surprise from foreigners.

Therefore, Chinese culture, in the eyes of foreigners, is simply an unfathomable enigma. Recently, Mrs. Rogers of the British Council sent me a copy of "A Brief History of China." Judging from its binding alone, the cover is full of "antique" oriental flavor, and we can know that its author, Mr. Goodliffe, has a very deep understanding of Chinese culture. Mr. Goodliffe is currently a professor of Chinese literature at Columbia University and can be said to be one of the Western scholars who understands Chinese culture best. He uses the most concise words to give a comprehensive report on Chinese culture, philosophy, politics, and economics, so that readers can clearly understand Chinese history at a glance. This work is most suitable for foreigners who do not know much about China's national conditions to read, and can make readers easily understand China. This is its characteristic and also its defect, because Chinese cultural history is as vast as the sea, and can never be included in a booklet of more than two hundred pages. In the eyes of our Chinese readers, it will inevitably be incomplete.

It was published in London this year and distributed by Allen & Unwin. The actual selling price is ten shillings and six pence.

### Zhong Kui

— By Wang Jinshan

### Learning from Thunder

After reading the photographic images of the Japanese war criminals who were sentenced on the fourth page of the thirteenth edition of this newspaper, I felt a release of pent-up emotions. These evil, dog-like wooden exhibitionists have bullied China for more than a decade and have disrupted the overall situation in the East. Now, one by one, in rows, they are receiving the punishment they deserve, reminding people of their wild shouts of "punishing" China and their ambition to dominate East Asia. Where did their power go? It is truly self-inflicted and Heavenly justice prevails!

These are all "objects of fear" and "objects of disgust," without a doubt, but the depth of the impression varies depending on the experiences and feelings in different places. This great war began with the "September 18th Incident" and opened with the "July 7th Incident," invading the whole of China from the Northeast and Hebei. The one who started the earliest, caused the most trouble, and had the worst reputation was the first one in the front row, Doihara Kenji. His evil deeds were numerous, and he had many nicknames. Westerners called him the Lawrence of the East, and Chinese people called him the real-life "Tu Xing Sun" or "Bandit." After the "September 18th Incident," this person took office and served as the so-called "Mayor of Fengtian" for a short time. Later, he went to Tianjin, where he threatened and coerced Puyi, kidnapped him to the east, and created the puppet Manchuria. The overall situation in the Northeast was entirely under the control of the Japanese puppets. He felt that there was no special drama to play, so he scurried into the Guannei, running to Tianjin, Peiping, Nanjing, Shanghai, and even Guangdong and Guangxi, stirring up trouble everywhere. At first, his movements were secretive, but later he became blatant. Especially during the period of Song Zheyuan's Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council, he scurried back and forth between Peiping, Tianjin, and the puppet government of eastern Hebei, strutting about as if there was no one else. People in Peiping and Tianjin covered their noses and ears when they heard that the "Bandit" had arrived. The Hebei-Chahar authorities could do nothing about it either. Secondly, Itagaki and Umezu, two old dwarfs, were the mainstays of the actual invasion before and after the two incidents, but in the minds of the public, they were not as widespread as the "Bandit." Itagaki first instigated the "September 18th Incident," and after the July 7th Incident, he went to the central China area and took military action. Umezu was the commander of the Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin in the Republic of China in 24th year. He was arrogant and overbearing. Later, he became the commander of the Kwantung Army, supervising the puppet Manchuria, and was full of power. After the defeat, he, along with Shigemitsu Aoi, one civil and one military, bowed their heads and signed the surrender on the Allied warship. Shigemitsu Aoi was the monster who had one leg blown off by the Korean patriot Yoon Bong-gil in the "January 28th" Songhu battle. At that time, he almost died, but after being cured, he remained active, serving as the Japanese ambassador to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. During the Wang puppet government, he also served as the "Ambassador to China." At that time, he and Nomura were known as one "cripple" and one "blind man" (Nomura was also one of the people who received Yoon Bong-gil's bomb, injuring one eye, but his life was unharmed. He was a naval officer, but he was heavily involved in diplomatic work, and served as Foreign Minister. Before the Pacific War, he served as the ambassador to the United States and handled negotiations with Kurusu until he returned home at the start of the war). As the saying goes, "Things do not exist alone, they must have a pair."
