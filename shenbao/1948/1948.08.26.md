These four proposals were submitted for discussion at the Political Affairs Meeting on the 25th, passed, and immediately ordered for implementation. Regarding the general budget for revenue and expenditure, revenue has increased due to tax adjustments and the calculation method has been changed to using gold yuan. On the expenditure side, there are also changes due to adjustments in soldier pay and increases after changes to public servant pay regulations. The plan will be revised and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. The revision of provincial and municipal budgets was drafted by the Local Finance Department of the Ministry of Finance, based on the currency reform, and is being revised again. The supplementary measures for streamlining tax revenue were discussed in detail at the meeting on the 25th. Basic principles have been decided for direct taxes, commodity taxes, salt taxes, etc. The supplementary regulations for the disbursement of salaries for civil and military public servants, soldiers, police, laborers, and servants have also been finalized, based on the principles in the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, and with reference to past regional divisions. The amount of gold to be issued to each region has been determined, and the multiplier has been confirmed. Soldier pay has also been adjusted, with the lowest amount reportedly being four yuan. All four items will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The principles for adjusting tax rates after the currency reform, as decided at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 25th, are as follows: (1) Direct tax will be levied starting from 300 yuan, increasing progressively, with those above 1.1 million yuan taxed at 30%. (2) The salt tax will be eight yuan per dan (unit of weight). (3) Commodity taxes will be adjusted based on the original prices of August 19th, with reference to pre-war tax rates.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The "Supplementary Regulations for the Disbursement of Salaries for Civil and Military Public Servants, Soldiers, Police, Laborers, and Servants," passed by the Executive Yuan on the 25th, were formulated according to local price levels and with reference to the principles stipulated in the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures for increasing or decreasing percentages. Details of the increase/decrease percentages are as follows: Zone 1, including Jinan and Qingdao, will increase by 70%. Zone 2, including Peiping and Tianjin, will increase by 40%.

Separate measures will be determined for special areas such as Shenyang and Taiyuan.

Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian first presented a report and explanation of the specific measures drafted by his ministry. However, after conversion to gold yuan, the amounts were mostly one jiao (tenth of a yuan) or a little over one jiao, which was too small. After discussion, it was decided to submit it for review and bring it up for discussion at the next meeting.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Presidential Decree: In accordance with the provisions of the Temporary Provisions for the Period of National Mobilization and Suppression of Rebellion, and upon the resolution of the Executive Yuan meeting, the Supplementary Measures for Streamlining Finances are hereby promulgated for the implementation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures of August 19th, 1937 of the Republic of China.

All parties here attach great importance to it.

### ECA Aid to China; Can Indirectly Support Gold Yuan; US Will Not Make Loans to Stabilize Currency

[United Press, Washington, August 24th] According to well-informed sources: Economic Cooperation Administration's aid to China can be indirectly used to support China's gold yuan. However, US authorities and international lending institutions have stated that they are unaware of any measures taken by the Chinese government to obtain support for the new currency. Nanjing has also denied it in the same way, but these rumors continue to reach the United States.

The International Monetary Fund has not yet formally approved the new exchange rate of four gold yuan to one US dollar, so China cannot obtain IMF assistance. As for the World Bank, it does not make loans to stabilize the currency except for loans for special development projects. And in any case, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund take consistent steps and will not provide loans to governments whose currency exchange rates have not been approved by the IMF.

At the same time, the US Export-Import Bank does not make loans to stabilize the currency. A spokesman for the Treasury Department said: It is impossible for the Treasury Department to make such loans now.

According to experts, it is very likely that a portion of the Chinese currency obtained from the sale of ECA materials will be used to stabilize the new currency, subject to the conditions agreed by the ECA. They said: This move requires "clearing" some accumulated paper money to stabilize the currency.

That is to say, the government must stop the circulation of some accumulated local currency, which will reduce the fundamental cause of China's inflation, which is fiscal deficits.

The ECA said: All loans are now for reconstruction projects, and there are no plans to use ECA funds to support the new currency.

### Executive Yuan Economic Control Committee; Holds First Meeting Today; Car and Boat Ticket Prices and Freight Rates Will Not Be Increased

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Executive Yuan Economic Control Committee, established due to the currency reform, has decided to hold its first meeting on the 26th, chaired by Premier Weng Wenhao. The committee will actively launch its work to promote various measures to stabilize the economy. In addition, the measures to control prices and crack down on hoarding and speculation formulated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to cooperate with the implementation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures were originally scheduled to be submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting on the 25th for discussion. However, since the original case sent by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce was too late, the Executive Yuan did not have time to print it and did not have time to review it, so it was not submitted on the 25th. It is now learned that it will be submitted for discussion at the first meeting of the Economic Control Committee on the 26th. After a preliminary decision is made, it will be submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting for discussion. The task of the committee is to plan and supervise price controls and to plan and control the crackdown on speculation, hoarding, and illegal operations.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] The Executive Yuan has decided to appoint Xu Boyuan as the Secretary-General of the Yuan's Economic Control Committee. The previous report that Liu Gongyun would take the post was incorrect.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Yesterday, it was rumored that the price increase of transportation businesses would be discussed at the Executive Yuan Political Affairs Meeting on the 25th. According to responsible personnel of the Executive Yuan, the Political Affairs Meeting today will not discuss this matter. It also stated that the ticket prices for seats on trains and ships, which are used by ordinary people, will be based on the ticket prices on August 19th, and freight rates are closely related to prices and cannot be increased.

### Short-Term Treasury Bills; Decision to Stop Issuance

Issuance of Gold Yuan Bonds Pending

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] After the currency reform, the issuance of short-term treasury bills issued by the Central Bank in the past has been decided to be stopped. Those sold before July 20th will be recovered by the Central Bank. As for the issuance of gold yuan bonds, the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance is still studying it. However, the first priority will be to reorganize the old public debt and formulate a method for calculating the conversion of legal tender into gold yuan. The issuance of new gold yuan bonds will take place after the reorganization of the old public debt is completed.

### Whether We Can Overcome the Difficulties; Depends on Financial and Economic Reform

Mr. Zhang Hopes for Assistance from Compatriots in the North

Zhang Lisheng met with reporters after getting off the plane and said: Please pay attention to the President's determination to reform finance and economy this time. We must strictly implement it. We dare not say that the overall plan has no problems, but we will never allow it to affect the whole. Whether the government can overcome the difficulties depends on how this reform goes, so I sincerely hope for the assistance of compatriots in the North. Regarding the special environment in the Northeast, the government has overall considerations. Without affecting the overall interests, it will never allow any place to be neglected. The materials most needed in the Northeast will be improved. The problem now is still transportation. Mr. Xia Jinxiong is here and will solve the issue of remittances between Guan Nei (inner China) and Guan Wai (outer China) at the same time. Regarding price controls, the government will also handle them carefully and will never allow merchants to raise prices without reason. If a price increase is necessary, it must first be approved by the government. Regarding the foreign assets of Chinese citizens, the government has its own methods, but it cannot tell people in advance. According to Xia Jinxiong, the government will also start with the budget when improving the remittance problem between Guan Nei and Guan Wai.

Important reports included: (1) Report on US aid materials to China as of August 20th, (2) Report on negotiating with chartered banks to handle US aid financial transactions. According to the US ECA regulations, only US banks are allowed to handle financial transactions. The Central Bank has signed credit agreements with nine banks including Citibank and Chase. Matters discussed and decided included: (1) Construction funds and industrial parts. The original construction fund of 60 million yuan and industrial parts of 10 million yuan were discussed and decided at this joint meeting after Stimpson went to Washington to consult with the US Economic Cooperation Administration. Both parties agreed that China urgently needs to restore production, and it is especially appropriate to reorganize and supplement the existing industrial, mining, and transportation equipment. Therefore, it was decided to use 35 million yuan for industrial parts, and the remainder will be used for rural rehabilitation, some US dollar expenses, and engineering design expenses. The aforementioned funds for industrial parts will be a gift from the United States to the Chinese government, which is more than originally planned. The funds for the construction plan will still be used as a loan. It has now been decided to establish a joint subcommittee to handle this matter. The Chinese representatives are Yan Jiagan, Ling Hongxun, and Wu Zhaohong, and the American representatives are Stimpson and John Shen. Under this committee, the Chinese government will hire a well-known American engineering design company to undertake technical planning work. (2) Cotton: (A) The Cotton Subcommittee will study the policy on the use of US aid cotton. The subcommittee will be composed of representatives from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the US ECA, the US Aid Committee, the China Textile Corporation, the Central Bank, and the Private Yarn Factory Association. The representative from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will serve as the convener. The subcommittee's recommendations will be implemented after being approved by the US Aid Committee and the US ECA. (B) Establish a "US Aid Cotton Yarn Joint Management Office" as the responsible implementation agency. The office will be composed of representatives from the Central Bank, the China Textile Corporation, and the Private Yarn Factory Association, with the representative from the Central Bank serving as the chairman.

Editorial

### Zhang Qun's Visit to Japan

Former Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun left Shanghai for Japan on the 21st in a private capacity to conduct an observation tour. In addition to his wife, he was accompanied by external advisor Shao Yulin. After Zhang arrived in Tokyo, he issued a statement declaring that this trip was purely an observational tour in a private capacity. He also expressed his gratitude to MacArthur for the generous hospitality he received when he passed through Japan on his return from the United States in 1945. Zhang further stated: The progress of peaceful and democratic construction in post-war Japan is the guarantee of Japan's national revival, and also the foundation for a permanent cooperative relationship between Japan and China, as well as other countries in the world. Everyone who cares about Japan and the overall situation in the world shares this view. Therefore, he declared that this trip was undertaken with this sentiment and expectation. It is heard that in the past few days, in addition to meeting with Prime Minister Ashida and visiting MacArthur, Shigeru Yoshida of the Democratic Liberal Party, Tetsu Katayama of the Social Democratic Party, and even former Prime Minister Kijuro Shidehara have all wanted to meet with Zhang. This shows that the Allied Headquarters and the Japanese government and public not only welcome Zhang's trip very much, but also regard him as a guest of honor. South Korean President Syngman Rhee even telegraphed an invitation for Zhang to visit Korea. From a courtesy standpoint, it is impossible to refuse the invitation of the South Korean President. In that case, Zhang's observation tour will at least extend to Japan and Korea.

There have been many rumors about Zhang's trip to Japan for observation, and opinions differ. Although these rumors are based on conjecture or speculation, it is clear that they are being taken seriously by all parties. There are several reasons for this importance: (1) Zhang is a former Premier of China and holds an important position in domestic politics. He is an expert on Japan, regarded by the world as China's "Japan expert," and before the war, he presided over diplomatic relations with Japan. Therefore, this visit to Japan is naturally attracting attention. (2) The peace treaty with Japan has not been concluded, and diplomatic relations between China and Japan have not been restored. Under MacArthur's control, Japan originally restricted private travel, but this time Zhang was able to go to Japan for observation in a private capacity and receive generous hospitality from MacArthur, which can be said to be an unprecedented exception. (3) The wave of anti-support for Japan in the country is surging, and the movements between the United States and Japan are attracting attention. Zhang's visit to Japan at this time, and the fact that he is a guest of honor of MacArthur, shows the great significance of this trip. We do not want to make premature conjectures about Zhang's trip. However, since Zhang has stated that he "came with expectations" for the "peaceful and democratic construction of post-war Japan," it is natural that this private trip, in addition to its observational nature, will have more or less gains. What should we expect? What should we gain? We would like to express some opinions from the standpoint of the Chinese people.

First, although Japan surrendered three years ago, there are no signs of peaceful and democratic progress in the current political, economic, and social situation in Japan. The provisions of the Potsdam Declaration, the basic policy towards Japan resolved by the Far Eastern Commission, and the reparations plan passed by the Far Eastern Commission have rarely been implemented in the past three years, or there are distances after implementation. Our country's policy towards Japan was originally generous and not retaliatory. The Japanese are aware of this. The spirit of the Potsdam Declaration is based on non-retaliation, and the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission tend to be more generous. Therefore, our expectation for the progress of peaceful and democratic construction in Japan should not deviate from the norms of these documents. We can only expect that the clauses revealed in these documents will be taken seriously by all parties and that there will be a guarantee of implementation before we can obtain true peace and democracy in Japan.

Second, the three cabinets of Yoshida, Katayama, and Ashida under the new constitution have not achieved much since taking office and have not created a democratic and progressive future for the Japanese people, which is regrettable. The opposition parties are complex and of a low level. Enlightened and liberal people are unwilling to compete with conservative bureaucratic politics for official careers, or they are parasitic in academic institutions or hidden in the fields. These are the biggest losses to Japan's peaceful and democratic progress. If our country wants to promote Japan, to support a progressive Japan, we should acquire truly enlightened, liberal, and progressive people and promote their unity into a force so that they can play a role in metabolism in politics and work for a good future relationship between China and Japan. The current political situation in Japan needs to be changed, and the progress of future Japanese politics should be expected to be far-reaching. If Japan still uses the same set of people as before the war to look at China and interact with China, and China also uses the same set of methods and understandings as before the war to deal with Japan, it may not be a blessing for the future of East Asia.

Third, the only way to settle the Japanese issue and clarify the disputes over the Far East's Japanese issue is to convene a Japanese peace conference, conclude a peace treaty with Japan, carry out control according to the treaty, and revive Japan according to the treaty, thereby eliminating the unhappiness between countries. There is now a way to break the stalemate in convening a Japanese peace conference. Among the attitudes of various countries, countries such as Britain, Australia, and the Philippines are in favor of convening a peace conference. The Soviet Union's attitude towards the Japanese peace conference may not be firmly rejected. The key at present seems to be in the United States, and the key to the United States is in MacArthur. As long as a way to break the stalemate is found in this regard, the peace conference may succeed within this year. As for the attitude within Japan, the Democratic Liberal Party (led by Yoshida) and the Democratic Party (led by Ashida), which represent conservative forces, do not welcome the peace conference. These parties want to use the state of no treaty to create a de facto situation that Japan can be revived immediately. These practices are for the sake of the party, not for the future of peace and democracy in Japan. The Socialist Party under Katayama and some liberals expect to convene a peace conference as soon as possible, which is a forward-looking view and worthy of our attention.

The above three points are our expectations for the study of the Japanese issue, and also our expectations for Zhang's visit to Japan. Even if Zhang's trip is a private visit, if he can gain something in this regard, then Zhang's observation tour will bring significant historical significance, and it can be said that he did not make this trip in vain.

### Siam Violates Treaty by Arbitrarily Arresting Overseas Chinese, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lodges Serious Protest, Urges Immediate Release and No Recurrence of Similar Actions

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently sent a memorandum to the Siamese representative in China, Xian Ya, on the 17th, lodging a strong protest against the Siamese government's arbitrary arrest of overseas Chinese in Siam, which violated its obligations under the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship. The ministry requested that the Siamese government be informed immediately to release the arrested overseas Chinese and to strictly order the Siamese police authorities to prevent similar actions from happening again. On June 15th of this year, the Bangkok police department arrested more than 50 overseas Chinese. Upon receiving the report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately telegraphed the embassy and consulate in Siam to investigate the reasons for the arrest in order to negotiate. However, despite repeated inquiries by our embassy and consulates in Siam, Siam did not respond. More than two months have passed. The Siamese authorities have neither notified the Chinese consulate of the reasons for the arrest of the overseas Chinese, nor have they announced the charges against them. According to Article 5 of the Sino-Siamese Treaty of Friendship, the protection of the physical and property safety enjoyed by overseas Chinese in Siam is the same as that enjoyed by the Siamese people. However, the Siamese police authorities recently used secret societies and illegal fundraising as excuses and suddenly arrested overseas Chinese on a large scale in various places based on old regulations promulgated ten years ago. Siamese newspapers also revealed news that all the arrested overseas Chinese would be deported, creating a terrible situation that made all the overseas Chinese in Siam feel insecure and panicked all day long. The Siamese side's large-scale arrest of overseas Chinese without following legal procedures is contrary to the letter and spirit of the aforementioned regulations. If they are deported, the property of the overseas Chinese will suffer significant losses. At a time when the issue of overseas Chinese education in Siam is being discussed by our embassy in Siam and Siam, the Chinese government particularly hopes that Siam will stop all actions in violation of the treaty to avoid hindering the traditional friendly relations between the two countries.

### Various Institutions in Northeast China Rush to Create Budgets, Prepare to Implement Public Treasury System, Political Committee is Studying Plans to Cooperate with New Measures

[This Newspaper, Shenyang, 25th] In order for currency reform to be implemented smoothly in the Northeast, the special system of the Northeast economy must be abolished, so the public treasury system must be established in order to balance fiscal revenue and expenditure.

### Stalin Agrees to Joint Control of Berlin Currency by Western Nations; Suggests Convening a Four-Power Meeting of Financial Experts to Draft an Agreement; Acknowledges the Right of the US, Britain, and France to Remain in Berlin

[Our Report] London, 25th Broadcast: According to well-informed diplomatic circles, Stalin has suggested convening a four-power meeting of financial experts in Berlin to draft an agreement on the control of Berlin currency. The ambassadors of the US, Britain, and France have separately reported to their governments and advocated accepting this suggestion. This suggestion implies two meanings: (1) The Soviet Union has agreed in principle to the Western nations' demand to participate in the management of the Berlin economy; (2) The Soviet Union recognizes the Western powers' right to continue occupying Berlin. This suggestion was made by Stalin during a meeting in the Kremlin on Monday night. Drafting an agreement on the control of Berlin currency by financial experts can eliminate the main obstacles to resolving the problem, and its main purpose is still to lift the Berlin blockade.

[Our Report] London, 25th Broadcast: Western powers' ambassadors believe that the Soviet Union may soon agree to rebuild the four-power control system in Berlin. There are three steps to implement this: First, the Soviet Union recognizes that the Western Allies have the right to continue to stay in Berlin and participate in Berlin's politics together with the Soviet Union. Second, the East German mark is the currency for the entire Berlin area, and the Western powers can jointly control the currency. Third, lift the Berlin blockade and ensure that the Western powers have the right to pass through the Soviet occupation zone to their respective occupation zones. External spokespersons said that as of now, there have been no further appointments for meetings.

[Our Report] London, 25th Broadcast: According to well-informed diplomatic sources, after a brief review of the current situation created by the Moscow negotiations, the governments of the US, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union may issue a joint communiqué.

[United Press, London, 25th] A British Foreign Office spokesperson said that the next meeting between the Western envoys in the Soviet Union and Kremlin officials is not yet ready because the Western nations still need to consult each other, especially the opinions of the Western representatives in Germany. It is expected that US Ambassador to Britain Douglas, French Ambassador Massigli, and British Soviet expert Under Secretary of State Strang will meet again tonight.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th] The US, British, and French governments are now studying Stalin's proposal and will not be able to make a decision on it until after forty-eight hours. Informed sources say that the three strong capitals are now studying the consequences of accepting and rejecting Stalin's proposal overnight. It is believed that this proposal includes the entire German question, not just the Berlin question. However, after the three strong powers have made a preliminary review, they may accept it. Officials refuse to reveal anything about this point. According to reliable sources, even if the three strong powers finally accept Stalin's proposal, it may not be equal to the three strong powers making concessions that they originally thought were unacceptable.

### Berlin Suddenly Turns Quiet; Soviet Commander Sends Letter to Mayor Schroeder; Orders Not Permitted by the Soviets are Invalid

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 25th] The Soviet Army Commander of the Berlin Soviet Zone, Kotikov, wrote to Mayor Schroeder stating that the Soviet military government finds it difficult to accept the decisions and orders of the municipal government authorities. All orders are invalid without the permission of the Soviet military government.

[United Press, Berlin, 25th] Berlin Soviet Military Commander Kotikov today ordered the post office in the Berlin Soviet area to re-examine and issue permits for various periodicals and daily newspapers. The deadline for re-registration is September 1. Kotikov's order is tantamount to formally prohibiting the circulation of newspapers in the Western occupation zones in the Soviet zone. For several months, the newspapers could only be secretly circulated in the Soviet zone.

Since the US side informally suggested that the police in the two parts of divided Berlin cooperate with each other, it is expected that the Soviet side will respond on the 25th. For a week, Berlin has been filled with riots, demonstrations, and kidnappings every day. This morning, it suddenly became calm, and the newspapers turned their attention to the recent negotiations in Moscow.

[Agence France-Presse, Nuremberg, 24th] Lieutenant Donner, the US military government chief of Kirchgengen who was arrested by the Soviet army yesterday while on patrol, and another US soldier, have been released today. Donner and his companion said that they accidentally entered the Soviet occupation zone while on patrol and were detained. During their day of imprisonment, the Soviet side treated them quite well.

### Membership Applications from Outer Mongolia and Other Countries Will Be Discussed by the UN General Assembly

Security Council Submits Review Report

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 24th] The Security Council today submitted a special report to the United Nations General Assembly, summarizing the status of the Security Council's review of applications from various countries to join the United Nations. Currently, the applicants for membership in the United Nations include Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Outer Mongolia, Portugal, Romania, Transjordan, and Ceylon, totaling thirteen countries. The applications of each country have been initially considered by last year's General Assembly, and are currently under review by the Security Council. It is believed that if the Security Council does not approve the participation of countries such as Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Albania, Finland, and Outer Mongolia, the Soviet Union will also not support the applications of countries such as Italy, Austria, Portugal, Transjordan, and Ireland. Therefore, the Security Council decided to report this situation to the General Assembly without making any recommendations. At the suggestion of Argentina, this year's United Nations General Assembly will discuss the issue of new member states joining. Argentina believes that any country that receives seven votes of support in the Security Council can join the United Nations. In other words, Argentina advocates that the participation of new member states should not be restricted by the veto power.

Finally, the Albanian government emphasized in the note that if Greece abandons its aggressive attitude, Albania is willing to resume negotiations with it and establish normal diplomatic relations.

### Wallace Declares He Is Not a Communist

The Progressive Party Is Also Not Controlled by the Communist Party

[Agence France-Presse, Ohio] Wallace issued a written statement to the press today, saying, "I am not a Communist Party member, and I have never participated in the Communist Party." The Progressive Party is determined not to be controlled by the Communist Party, and the Progressive Party's platform is determined not to be influenced by the Communist Party. He said that communism and progressives are vastly different from capitalism, and that the two parties may have some similarities in certain social facilities. According to Wallace's opinion, there are two types of communist parties in the United States, one that attempts to overthrow the US government by force, and the other that does not. The Third Party only wants to take joint action with the latter.

[Central News Agency, New York, 24th] Wallace's statement was obviously made for a reason, because recently, all parties have accused the Progressive Party of becoming a "foreign" organization of the Communist Party. This accusation will cause the Progressive Party to lose the support of many free people.

### The Soviet Union Suddenly Orders the Closure of Two Soviet Consulates in New York and San Francisco; Demands the US to Close Its Consulate in Vladivostok

[United Press, Washington, 24th] The Soviet Union ordered on the 24th to "immediately" close the Soviet consulates in New York and San Francisco, and demanded that the United States also close its consulate in Vladivostok and stop trying to open a US consulate in Leningrad. The Soviet Union submitted a note to the White House, stating that the reason for the Soviet Union's decision was that it believed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation, together with the White Russians, had infringed on the freedom of Soviet citizens in the United States. The Kremlin again denied that its own consulate officials had interfered with the freedom of two Soviet teachers in New York.

The note stated that the Soviet consulates in New York and San Francisco would be closed immediately, and in accordance with the policy of reciprocity, the United States would also be required to close its consulate in Vladivostok. The note also stated that the Soviet government believed that the agreement in progress that stipulated that the United States could open a consulate in Leningrad was automatically cancelled due to the actions of the United States. The White House has confirmed that it has received the note. This incident occurred when leading officials of Western countries were pessimistic about the Moscow meeting and are now more cautiously optimistic. The State Department, due to the abuse of power and violation of the standards of official proper conduct by the Soviet Consul General in New York, Lomokin, issued a strong note ordering Lomokin to leave the country. The points of reprimand made by the State Department were based on Lomokin's detention of Mrs. Kosenkina and Mrs. Kosenkina's jumping out of the window from the fourth floor of the Soviet consulate.

### The Soviet Government Supports Lomokin's Actions

The Soviet official news agency TASS reported on the 24th that the Soviet government fully endorsed all the actions taken by Lomokin in handling the matter. It was reported that the Soviet reply stated that the Soviet side had "many documents" sufficient to prove that Mrs. Kosenkina and another escaped teacher, Samarin, had been kidnapped, and that the Tolstoy Foundation of the White Russians and the Federal Bureau of Investigation had participated in the matter. TASS continued that the recent Soviet note was submitted to the State Department by Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin. TASS broadcast on Moscow Radio, "The Soviet government believes that the contents of the US note on August 19 (which rejected Panyushkin's protest and ordered Lomokin to leave the country) are unfounded and inconsistent with the facts." Moscow Radio also broadcast the full text of the US notes rejecting the protests of Panyushkin and Molotov. The Soviet Union said that the United States deliberately avoided the facts and failed to provide any assistance in clarifying the ambiguous points in the kidnapping case. Moscow also said that the US note "only prevents the clarification of this case and the parts in which certain individuals and groups participated in this case."

Hodge said that in the three years he stayed in Korea, he admired the Korean people quite a bit. He asked the Korean leaders to "abandon all selfish and personal ambitions and work entirely for the happiness of the entire Republic of Korea." He expressed confidence in the future success of the Republic of Korea. At the same time, State Department representative Gergeb will also leave here on the 26th and return to Washington. Gergeb will be the Far East liaison officer for the US delegation to the Third Plenary Session of the United Nations in Paris to participate in the UN General Assembly's consideration of the Korean issue.

### Mrs. Kosenkina's Press Conference Canceled Again Temporarily

She Had Intended to Announce the Details of the Jump from the Building

[United Press, New York, 24th] Mrs. Kosenkina had agreed on the 24th to announce her own experience of jumping out of the Soviet Consulate, but it was finally canceled temporarily. A police officer said when preventing reporters from entering Mrs. Kosenkina's ward in Roosevelt Hospital, "She is stimulated and feels tired and does not want to see anyone." Newsreel and newspaper photographers had been to Mrs. Kosenkina's room, and hospital authorities said that their flashbulbs had frightened Mrs. Kosenkina. When reporters approached the ward, Mrs. Kosenkina called the doctor to tell him that she felt unable to meet visitors. Her internist Ford and surgeon Pannoye then canceled the reporters' visit. The hospital originally intended to allow a small number of reporters to enter, but more than a dozen people tried to crowd in. The reporters had been waiting since morning, intending to hear Mrs. Kosenkina's own account of her jump from the window of the Soviet Consulate, and they had previously submitted thirteen written questions. The hospital nurse said that when the questions were read to Mrs. Kosenkina, she nodded frequently to indicate her approval. The reporters had raised money to buy flowers for Mrs. Kosenkina.

Marshall Believes That the Soviet Action Is Not a Serious Development

[Our Report] London, 25th Broadcast, Moscow: Reliable sources believe that although the Soviet Union has severed consular relations with the United States, it will not affect the negotiations on the Berlin and other issues.

He said the US has accepted the Soviet request and will close the Vladivostok consulate. This matter is not serious, as the activities of the consulate staff there have long been restricted and they cannot fully perform their duties. Marshall added that in the future, Soviet diplomatic affairs in the United States can be handled by the Soviet Embassy, and US consular affairs in the Soviet Union can be handled by the consular staff in the US Embassy in Moscow.

US officials emphasized that the UK and Burma still have military ties, and Burma will hold direct negotiations on military assistance with the UK. Some officials believe that the UK's need for military supplies in Malaya makes it impossible for the UK to transfer a large amount of leased supplies in the Straits area to Burma.

The morning meeting discussed the edible oil issue, and those present included Mayor Wu, Deputy Minister of Food Chen Liang, Liu Gongyun, Wu Kaixian, Yang Chuo'an, Zhang Yuqiu, Li Lixia, Lin Chongyong, Chen Shuhui, and more than ten others. It was resolved to request the Executive Yuan to issue an order prohibiting the export of rapeseed oil, soybean oil, sesame oil, peanut oil, and their raw materials, temporarily for a period of three months. Restrictions will be imposed on the transshipment of edible oil, taking into account the actual needs of various cities in South China.

### Social Bureau Re-advises All Industries to Adhere to August 19th Fixed Prices; Paint Industry Points Out That Exchange Rates Affect Raw Material Prices

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Social Bureau continued to summon responsible persons from various industries in the city yesterday to talk, advising them to abide by government orders and not exceed the August 19th price. The result was very good.

The person in charge of the Paint Industry Association stated that the industry would automatically adjust to the August 14th price, but there were two difficulties that must be resolved: (1) Raw material difficulties. If the price of products from Chinese vegetable oil factories rises, it will inevitably affect the industry and should be prevented. (2) The original exchange certificate price was only 8.5 million, but now it has increased to 12 million, which means that the price of raw materials purchased from abroad has already increased and should be addressed.

The cigarette industry also stated that it would not raise prices, but hoped that taxes would not be increased. If the government increases taxes, then according to the principle of "the wool comes from the sheep," the price of cigarettes will inevitably increase.

The Porcelain Industry States That It Has Not Increased Prices

The Porcelain Industry Association stated that the rumor that the industry has increased by 10-20% is inaccurate. This is because the industry has wholesale prices and retail prices. The retail price was originally higher than the wholesale price. The current change is from the wholesale price to the retail price, and there has been no actual increase. The Social Bureau instructed the person in charge of the bureau to send a copy of the wholesale and retail prices of August 19th to the bureau for review.

High Fresh Meat Prices Blamed on Production Area

The fresh meat industry stated that it has suppressed the retail price to around 2 million per catty. However, the price on August 19th was based on the price of pork purchased from the Subei production area on August 10th. The current price should be based on the price of pork in the Subei production area on August 19th. Because the taxes and fees in the Subei Pacification Zone are very heavy, the price in the production area on August 19th has already risen sharply. If the Social Bureau limits the price based on the price of pork in Shanghai on August 19th, it may not be able to be maintained for long. The Social Bureau will submit this matter to the municipal government and then to the Executive Yuan to request that the Subei Pacification Zone pay attention.

The Social Bureau will continue to summon the persons in charge of the tung oil industry, the cigarette industry, and the tobacco leaf industry today to declare the points that should be noted regarding the price issue.

### Sugar Quotations Subject to Approval and Sale Must Not Exceed Regulations

A total of 23,512 packages were applied for by 327 units, and 15,690 packages were approved for 293 units, at 27 yuan and 1 jiao per dan.

### Ten Merchants Suspended from Distribution for Adulterating Household Sugar

### Hui Minggan Indicted for Espionage, Transferred to Special Criminal Court for Trial

Acquitted of Instigating Murder

[Reported by This Newspaper] Hui Minggan, a native of Jiangbei, was the chief of public security for the Communist bandits in Wangji Township, Funing Township in 1945 of the Republic of China. At that time, there was a Hui Mingling. Minggan said that he had political activities (referring to participating in the Kuomintang), so he instigated his younger brother Hui Mingtao to kill him. In the autumn of that year, when the National Army entered Wangji Township to suppress the bandits, Minggan and Hui Shengmao, who was on the run, discussed suppressing the families of the victims, and successively killed Kuomintang members Zhou Xiru and local gentry Dai Lifeng and others to intimidate them. In February of this year, Minggan and Zhang Buda traveled to Shanghai together. Hui Mingling's son Mingzu learned about it and reported it to the Garrison Headquarters, which arrested Minggan. He firmly denied participating in the work of the Communist bandits. Later, after the headquarters telegraphed Funing to reply, it was confirmed that this was the case. Minggan was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation as an instigator of murder and filed a public prosecution. Zhang Buda was sent to the Special Criminal Court for investigation due to the crime of internal rebellion. The District Court opened a court session yesterday and announced that the defendant Hui Minggan was innocent of instigating murder due to lack of conclusive evidence, but he was suspected of espionage and was transferred to the Special Criminal Court for trial.

### Thoroughly Rectify Military Discipline; Garrison Headquarters Holds Meeting

In order to thoroughly rectify military discipline, Xuan Tiewu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, invited the heads of various military agencies in Shanghai and the commanders of various troops to hold a meeting at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. During the meeting, Xuan stated that the Garrison Headquarters was ordered to rectify military discipline and was determined to do so, but this work was very difficult. In addition to the Gendarmerie Regiment and the military discipline inspection team of the Garrison Headquarters regularly taking responsibility, it is also hoped that the army, navy, and air force joint logistics military units will work together to maintain a good military reputation by restraining their subordinates. The meeting decided: (1) The navy, air force, and logistics units will send personnel to organize inspection teams to cooperate with the gendarmerie and the inspection team of the Garrison Headquarters to carry out the work of rectifying military discipline. (2) Military personnel must comply with the regulations when taking public transportation and entering entertainment venues.

### Trial of Okamura Cost 3 Billion, Date of Retrial Undecided, Transfer to Tokyo Inaccurate

General Okamura Neiji, the number one Japanese war criminal, was publicly tried for the first time by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense in this city on the 23rd. It was found that the collected evidence was insufficient, and it was decided to postpone the retrial for the sake of solemnity. However, the date of the public trial has not yet been decided. It is learned that there are two reasons: (1) It is necessary to collect strong evidence from all relevant parties. (2) Insufficient funds for the public trial. One public trial of Okamura Neiji on the 23rd cost more than 1 billion national currency for the Chinese meal alone. The total cost of preparation and arrangement before and after reached 3 billion, while the public funds allocated by the Ministry of National Defense were not even half of the amount spent. Therefore, the court has once again submitted a request to the Ministry of National Defense for the allocation of funds to facilitate a quick trial. As for the rumor that Okamura Neiji may be transferred to the Tokyo International Tribunal in the near future, the military court stated that it is absolutely inaccurate. Okamura did not participate in the central system organization that invaded China, and his crimes are limited to the facts caused in the Chinese battlefield, so there is no need to transfer him to the Tokyo International Tribunal.

### National Federation of Grain Merchants Urges Exemption from Business Tax

### Falling for Someone and Breaking the Law, Love Letters with Blood, Intimidating and Climbing Through Windows to Profess Love, Ma Shuli Finds Himself in Trouble

[Report from Our Newspaper] Ma Shuli, a native of Beiping who previously worked in the statistics office of the municipal government, was attracted to Zhang Yunxiu, a female colleague in the same office, because of her attractive appearance and began to pursue her. However, Zhang did not reciprocate Ma's feelings. Although Ma repeatedly harassed her and asked her to marry him, Zhang ignored him. Ma was subsequently dismissed for improper behavior but remained unwilling to give up on Zhang. He even wrote a letter in blood to Zhang, threatening her, but Zhang still did not respond. Seeing that his goal was not achieved, Ma further climbed through the window into Zhang's residence three times, on the 3rd, 16th, and 25th of last month, to profess his love to Zhang. Unable to bear the harassment, Zhang reported the matter to the police, who detained Ma and sent him to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning. After investigation, the prosecutor's office has filed a public prosecution against Ma on charges of obstructing freedom.

### Part of the Fahua Temple, Enemy Property, Appropriated and Occupied, Trial Begins After Prosecution

[Report from Our Newspaper] Fahua Temple in western Shanghai covers an area of more than 30 mu and has five main halls. During the occupation period, it was occupied by the puppet Security Command as a repair shop. In addition to the main halls, three two-story buildings and two kitchens were built. After the victory, it was taken over by the Confidential Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense and used as a warehouse, with Ma Houqing appointed as the administrator. In the winter of the previous year, after the materials in the warehouse were cleared out, Ma notified the temple monk Zeng Chang, saying that he was ordered to return the property to the owner. Zeng Chang immediately recognized the property as temple property. Subsequently, Ma colluded with Ma Huifu and rented the above-mentioned property from Zeng Chang, converting it into the Xingji Primary School run by the mosque. One of the telephone lines in the building was illegally transferred by Ma Yifang on January 6 of this year. After investigation by the Confidential Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, in addition to detaining Ma Houqing and sentencing him to seven years in prison as a soldier, the entire case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The office considered that the temple monk Zeng Chang, Ma Huifu of Xingji Primary School, and Ma Yifang had misappropriated enemy property and filed a joint prosecution against them. Yesterday, the District Court opened a trial, and only Zeng Chang appeared as the defendant. He stated that the temple buildings had been partially built in 1937, but before they were completed, the puppet Security Command continued the construction. Later, Ma Houqing verbally notified him to return the property and introduced him to open a primary school. The court adjourned the hearing to a later date due to the absence of the other defendants, and Zeng Chang was released on his original bail.

### Accusation Against Penglai District Chief, Civil Affairs Bureau Thoroughly Investigates Accounts

### Experts Participate in Assessing Gold Purity, National Bank States That Claim of Price Depression Is a Misunderstanding

[Report from Our Newspaper] There have been rumors that when the National Bank buys gold, it deliberately lowers the purity of the gold and forcibly buys it if the seller is unwilling to sell it at a discount. The reporter inquired about this with Deputy Director Li Xiaozhuang of the Business Bureau, who is in charge of the purchase work. According to him, all the rumors are misunderstandings. Regarding the purity of gold, the standard for pure gold stipulated in the financial and economic emergency plan is 1,000 parts per thousand. However, in recent years, most of the gold in this city has not met this standard. Therefore, when buying gold, discounts are made according to the purity of the gold, but there is absolutely no deliberate lowering of the purity. As for forced purchases, it is even more of a misrepresentation. Because gold is purchased in order, the staff hopes that the seller will not change their mind at the last minute to save time, but if they insist on not selling, there is absolutely no compulsion. At the same time, after each tael of gold is purchased, the seller receives a receipt stating the weight and purity. If there are any questions, they can use this receipt to retrieve the original gold for re-examination. Regarding whether there is an objective standard for determining the purity of gold, the Central Bank and other entrusted banks have experts participating in the purchase. Although the accuracy of their determination cannot be compared with melting analysis, it is not far from the actual value.

### Purchase Results Get Better and Better, Yesterday's Total Exceeded Ten Million Yuan

The total value is more than ten million gold yuan.

Legal tender continues to be withdrawn, but the amount is small. The previous day, it was about 200 billion, and yesterday it was about 300 billion. Once legal tender is withdrawn, it will no longer be issued.

### Total Purchase Amount the Day Before Yesterday, Over Nine Million Gold Yuan

The 24th was the second day that the National Bank and its entrusted banks began purchasing gold, silver, and foreign currencies. Citizens who complied with the law and exchanged gold, silver, and foreign currencies for gold yuan coupons were more enthusiastic than on the 23rd. Despite the rainy weather, the lines for exchange still stretched outdoors. In total, on the 24th, the National Bank and its entrusted agents in this city purchased 17,128 taels, 6 mace, 9 fen, and 6 li of gold, and exchanged 3,425,739.20 gold yuan coupons. 24,954 taels, 7 mace, 9 fen, and 3 li of silver were purchased, and a total of 74,864.379 gold yuan coupons were exchanged. 47,243 silver coins were purchased, and a total of 94,486 gold yuan coupons were exchanged. 1,288,317.65 US dollars were purchased, and a total of 5,153,270.60 gold yuan coupons were exchanged. 575,130.10 Hong Kong dollars were purchased, and a total of 431,347.575 gold yuan coupons were exchanged.

### China Merchants Bureau Will Be Reorganized into a Company, Assets of Six Hundred Million Gold Yuan Coupons

### Police Officer Injured in Sutaizhou Hotel Case, Batch of Criminals Prosecuted Separately

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Keqin and Zhang Changgui, two police officers from the Criminal Police Division of the Municipal Police Bureau, were arresting the thief Zhang Shujun in the Sutaizhou Hotel at No. 5, Lane 531, Fuzhou Road on June 17 when Xue Lanying, the thief's girlfriend, learned of it. She ran to a man named Lu Baoshan for help, and Lu readily agreed. He led his gang members Sun Guifeng, Lü Songyun, Xu Cunzhi, Zhu Changyin, Sun Rongzhen, Chen Xiaomao, Tan Jinsheng, Jiang Jinshu, etc., in cars and pedicabs to lie in ambush at the entrance of the Sutaizhou Hotel alley, waiting for an opportunity to rescue Zhang Lianjun. Lu Baoshan also gave Sun Guifeng a small machete, instructing her to stab the two police officers. When Wang and Zhang escorted Zhang Lianjun out of the hotel door and were about to get into the car to return to the bureau, Lu Baoshan shouted and ordered his gang members to swarm forward and punch and kick Wang and Zhang. Sun Guifeng then stabbed Wang in the head with the knife. Fortunately, Wang dodged quickly and protected himself with his hand, suffering only a knife wound to the front of his head and a cut on his right wrist. Zhang, due to his strong physique, was only slightly injured. Zhang then fired a warning shot, and Lu and his gang members fled in all directions. The thief Zhang Tongjun also took the opportunity to escape, but was soon captured again in the Jiuanli alley on Hubei Road. On July 12, at about 9:00 AM, Lu Baoshan again incited Sun Guifeng, Lü Songyun, Xu Cunzhi, Sun Rongzhen, and Chen Xiaomao to jointly rob six sections of galvanized iron bars from a truck in front of the Litai Warehouse outside the Dada Wharf and sell them to Zhang Wanbao, who knew about the crime, dividing the proceeds for their own use. Later, Lu led Wang Fengshan, Zhang Ruqing, and others to steal three bags of soybeans from a barge at Dada Wharf No. 3 and were detained and released by the Water Police Sub-Bureau. When Lu and others were dividing the loot at Lu's residence at No. 34 Heng Street, Yangjiadu, in the Nanshi district, the police discovered it and arrested them. Only Jiang Jinshu, Wang Fengshan, and Zhang Ruqing escaped. The rest were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning. The office has now completed the investigation and filed public prosecutions against all of the above defendants for attempted murder, assault, escape, robbery, and receiving stolen goods.

### Collapse During Renovation of Bungalow on Changning Road, Four Killed or Injured, Carpenter Detained for Investigation

[Report from Our Newspaper] The bamboo bungalow at No. 1513 Changning Road in western Shanghai was in disrepair and on the verge of collapse. The owner, Zhang Liangen (40 years old, from Pudong, engaged in the mirror frame business), hired carpenter Chen Zhichang to renovate it into a wooden house.

### The First Construction Project in Sichuan Province: Dujiang Power Plant

— By Our Reporter, Zhou Xueduan

[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 22nd] On the day of the triumphant return to the capital, the central government clearly designated Sichuan as a construction experimental province. At that time, under the leadership of Zhang Yuejun, the Sichuan Provincial Government drafted two major post-war construction plans for Sichuan: the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Dujiang Power Plant. However, three years of banditry and the exhaustion of the people's strength caused the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to experience slow progress due to financial difficulties. Only the Dujiang Power Plant project proceeded smoothly due to the cooperation between the Resources Commission and the Sichuan Provincial Government. After one year and nine months of arduous labor, the first part of the entire project was officially completed last month, with the Dujiang Thermal Power Plant commencing power generation. Therefore, the Dujiang Power Plant is the first construction project in Sichuan after the war.

Surveying Process: World-Renowned Engineers Presided Over the Work

The Dujiang Power Plant is located in Guanxian, western Sichuan, utilizing the world-famous Dujiangyan irrigation system to construct a hydropower project. Our reporter visited Guanxian and conducted a comprehensive interview regarding the plant. First and foremost, the entire project plan and surveying process was initially overseen by Dr. Savage, an American authority on hydraulic engineering. Dr. Savage was employed to come to Sichuan in July of the 33rd year of the Republic, and successively conducted on-site surveys in areas along the Dadu River, Maben River, and the upper reaches of the Min River, selecting Yuzui and Maxi in Guanxian as dam sites. Secondly, in the spring of the 34th year of the Republic, the Wartime Production Bureau specially invited American power transmission experts to guide the Western Sichuan Surveying Office, penetrating deep into the upper reaches of the Min River in western Sichuan for over a year of surveying, completing dam site drilling and hydrological research work. By the 35th year of the Republic, when the Dujiang Power Plant construction plan was established, the Resources Commission sought loans from Canada to start construction. Consequently, a group of Canadian engineers led by Sachs, together with the Hydropower Administration of the Resources Commission, formed an engineering team to survey the dam site in Guanxian and study the Dujiang water power and development procedures. Work was successively completed in March of the 36th year of the Republic. During this period, Dr. Savage, American geological expert Zhong Foou, and American engineer Gan Wenji from the Resources Commission successively came to Guanxian to conduct dam site excavation, geological surveys, and final design work. By April of the 36th year of the Republic, the entire project plan was finalized.

Two Plans: American and Canadian Experts Had Differing Opinions

The grand Dujiang Power Plant project had two plans: One was presided over by Dr. Savage of the United States, which planned to build a 200,000-kilowatt power plant at Yuzui in the upper reaches of Dujiang and a 500,000-kilowatt power plant at Maxi. In addition, a dam was to be built at Yuzui (1,080 meters long, 70 meters high, with a drop of 35 meters), with an estimated total cost of US$50 million and a power generation cost of US$0.025 per kilowatt-hour. After completion, the benefits were estimated to be 60% for irrigation and 40% for power generation, which could electrify the entire western Sichuan Plain. The other plan was presided over by the Canadian engineering team, with completely opposite opinions. They believed that western Sichuan could not digest such a large amount of electricity at all, and that the source of funds and materials were problematic, so the scope should be reduced in principle. Their plan was: First, build a 50,000-kilowatt power plant at Zipingpu in Guanxian, a 50,000-kilowatt power plant at Maliuwan, and a 35,000-kilowatt power plant at Houzipo. In addition, build a 250,000-kilowatt power plant at Xuankou and build a dam at the same time (867 meters long, 78 meters high, with a drop of 40 meters). After careful research by the Sichuan Provincial Government and the Resources Commission, these two major plans decided to agree with and adopt the Canadian engineer's plan. At the same time, since several previous locations were not satisfactory after geological analysis, it was decided to focus on the construction of the Xuankou Power Plant, which is today's Dujiang Power Plant.

Initial Stage of Construction: Two Years of Arduous Construction Completed the Dujiang Thermal Power Plant

After the plan was decided, preparations were made to implement the project. The Resources Commission and the Sichuan Provincial Government jointly established the Dujiang Power Plant to take charge. It was decided to divide the project into two parts: the first part was to build the Dujiang Thermal Power Plant first. Construction began in the 35th year of the Republic. The Resources Commission initially allocated two 2,000-kilowatt generators. After countless twists and turns, one unit was finally received at the end of the 35th year and shipped to Sichuan. However, due to various transportation problems, it took a full ten months for the generator to be dismantled, packaged, and transported to the thermal power plant in Puchun, Guanxian. After another four months of round-the-clock work by the engineering staff, and the erection of the Chengdu-Guanxian long-distance power transmission line, the entire power plant was completed in February of this year, and the power transmission was completed in June. In June, the Chengdu power distribution station was hastily repaired, and power generation officially began last month. The first phase of the thermal power plant was thus completed.

Our reporter visited the Dujiang Thermal Power Plant. The plant site is located in Puchun, Guanxian, covering a considerable area. The current machinery of the power plant includes water supply equipment and coal conveying machines, two boilers and two steam engines, turbo generators, condensers and cooling towers, and a repair shop is attached. The current total power generation is 2,000 kilowatts, of which 100 kilowatts are supplied to the plant itself, the Air Force Youth School, and the coal mine, 200 kilowatts are supplied to Guanxian, and the remaining 1,500 kilowatts are all transmitted to Chengdu. Recently, the Resources Commission has allocated another 5,000-kilowatt generator, which has already arrived in Chongqing. If there are no transportation problems, it can be installed and completed within the year.

Electrifying Western Sichuan · Future Engineering Focus · Completing Hydropower Plans

As for the current focus of work, the focus is on carrying out drilling work for the hydropower plant. To date, over a year has passed, and more than 130 holes have been drilled in the Xuankou area. The success of the thermal power plant has greatly helped drilling and various construction projects. In the future, the focus will be on the phased construction of the hydropower plant: The first phase is to complete the drilling, the second phase is to build the plant site, the third phase is to install the machinery and complete the dam project, and the last is to construct the western Sichuan power transmission network. The future plan is to take Guanxian (Dujiang Power Plant) as the center, with a radius of 250 kilometers as the radiation route, including Jiange in the north, Maogong in the west, Ya'an in the south, and Ziyang in the east, all within this "Western Sichuan Power Grid". This is the most essential area of the "Land of Abundance". The light and heavy industries planned in this power area include: textile manufacturing, sugar refining, coal mining, chemical fertilizers, papermaking, cement, steel, cotton spinning, wool, etc., which will be combined with the completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to create a bright and boundless construction prospect for Sichuan.

After spending half a day visiting and interviewing at the Dujiang Power Plant, I only saw the surface of the thermal power plant and the plan of the hydropower plant, as well as the tense work spirit of the engineering staff. However, from here I saw the success of the Dujiang Power Plant and the bright future of Sichuan's construction.

### Nanyang Overseas Chinese Fuqun Company

Regular Shareholders' Meeting to be Held

[Our Hong Kong Dispatch, 22nd] The Nanyang Overseas Chinese Fuqun Industrial Company was founded in the first year of the Republic by more than one hundred ambitious overseas Chinese from the Americas and Hong Kong, including Li Qi, Li Yutang, Li Qian, Feng Ziyou, and Li Haiyun. It purchased tens of thousands of mu of wasteland in Xiaohongshan, Anhui, and more than 1,300 mu of land in Lianzhuzhou, Dashengguan, Nanjing. In the second year of the Republic, the manager, Li Qi, developed the wasteland along the river in Nanjing into a farm, purchasing many kinds of new European and American agricultural implements, on a grand scale. Unfortunately, in the autumn and winter of the second year of the Republic, Feng Guozhang accused it of being a pro-Yuan Shikai party, saying it was related to Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing, and arrested the manager Li Qi and imprisoned him. Fortunately, the Cantonese merchants in Shanghai jointly bailed him out, and he was released without incident. In order to avoid the ravages of the warlords, the company leased the entire farm to the Agricultural College of Southeast University for management. In the fourth year of the Republic, Li Qi was ordered by Zhu Zhixin to launch an anti-Yuan army in Liangyang and other places in southern Guangdong, but he failed and was martyred. In the twenty-fifth year of the Republic, the chairman of the company, Li Yutang, passed away. The company then entrusted shareholder Feng Ziyou as the agent in Beijing and Shanghai, leasing the farm to the Agricultural College of Central University as an agricultural trial farm. In the twenty-seventh year of the Republic, the Japanese invaders occupied Nanjing, and the farm was taken over by the puppet government. In the thirty-fourth year of the Republic, Nanjing was restored, and the company recovered the farm, leasing it to shareholder Li Yinhong, who lived in the Overseas Chinese New Village in Banqiao Town, for cultivation. Now, the company's board of directors believes that many shareholders in various places have passed away over the past thirty years, and times have changed. It is also necessary to re-register and expand the company. It is specifically scheduled to convene a shareholders' meeting in Hong Kong on the 28th of this month to discuss all matters.

### The Eve of the Communist Occupation of Kaifeng, A Bloody Episode, Burying Drug Offenders, Swallowing Gold, County Magistrate Wang Jieyi Accused

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 25th] After the communist occupation of Kaifeng was reversed, a confusing case of buried bodies occurred in the county government. The county council believes that County Magistrate Wang Jieyi shot and killed drug offenders and swallowed gold when the communists occupied Kaifeng. However, although County Magistrate Wang strongly denied it in a letter, the county council has formally transferred the case to the court for investigation according to law. The Kaifeng District Prosecutor's Office sent prosecutor Yue Bangjie a few days ago to inspect the bodies at the county government with Speaker Li Fansheng and more than 20 councilors, and took a statement from Wang Jieyi. Subsequently, Speaker Li stated the location where the bodies were buried, and many bodies were exhumed. The county council stated: "When the communists occupied Kaifeng on May 19, County Magistrate Wang privately killed nine people, including drug offenders Niu and Zhang, with the police bureau, swallowed more than 40 taels of gold from them, and buried the bodies in the county government. The council once questioned Wang Jieyi, but Wang firmly denied it. Later, Speaker Li and others personally went to investigate and found bloodstained clothes, human bones, and other items on the ground, and a foul smell permeated the air, proving that there were indeed dead bodies buried there. Wang was speechless at the time. Later, on the evening of the 14th, he wrote a reply to the council, stating that the county government had not made any emergency arrangements to shoot anyone before the communists occupied Kaifeng. During the communist occupation, communist troops resided in the government, and our aircraft bombed the government. The government had no way of knowing who buried the bodies and how many there were. Furthermore, three boxes of medicines from the health center were secretly buried in the open space in the west courtyard before the communist occupation. When the hospital went to get the medicines after the communist occupation, it was found that there were corpses buried on top of the boxes. If it was the county government that shot and killed the criminals, it would not have buried them on top of the medicine boxes." The case is currently under investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office.

### Guangdong Forms Farmland Irrigation Association

### Guan Jiyu Talks About Food

— By Our Special Correspondent, Fang Canglang

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 23rd] In the early autumn when the new grain is on the market and the gold yuan is born, in order to know more about the news of Jiangsu's grain requisition, purchase, and borrowing, I interviewed Minister of Food Guan Jiyu and listened to his remarks on the food issue that everyone cares about. The summary is as follows:

At the beginning of the meeting, the reporter asked him the first question: According to the reports from various provinces, what is the preliminary estimate of this year's national autumn harvest? He frankly said: This year, the regions with the most grain production, such as Sichuan, Hunan, and Jiangxi, have reduced their harvests due to floods. However, on a comprehensive estimate, the harvests are mixed. The problem cannot be said to be too serious. If the foreign grain purchased and transported this year arrives on schedule and in sufficient quantities, and the adjustment and allocation work is actively carried out in various places in the future, it is expected that both military supplies and people's food can be properly resolved. Because the importance of military grain is known to everyone, and the severity of the people's food problem caused by the war has made people across the country deeply understand: In order to implement national policies, the Ministry of Food must implement this emergency food policy every year during wartime, such as requisitioning, purchasing, and borrowing. There is no other choice but to earnestly follow and assist. Now the suppression war has entered a decisive stage. Once the autumn is high and the horses are fat, the national army will be able to achieve a decisive victory on all fronts. However, to make the soldiers full and the strong men in the rear full, the government must successfully promote the policy of "sufficient food" and "sufficient troops." I remember that during the First World War, Hoover, who was in charge of American food policy, once said: "The final victory of the war depends on the people's food." At that time, Moltke, the chief of the German General Staff, also said: "To destroy Germany without fighting, unless you destroy German agriculture and block German food." Later, Moltke's words unfortunately came true. The importance of wartime food policy is the same in China and foreign countries.

Speaking of the food growth and decline and surpluses and deficits of various provinces in China, Minister Guan said: In his book "The Food Problem in China," published in May of this year, it is explained that my country's grain production last year, including rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains, was: 137,068,000 tons, but the national annual consumption of grain was 141,034,000 tons, with a deficit of 3,966,000 tons. Last year, the surplus grain areas in China included the nine northeastern provinces, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Taiwan, as well as Xiang, E, Gan, Wan, Cha, Qing, Ning, Re, Dian, and other 31 provinces. The grain deficit areas included Yue, Gui, Yu, Ji, Qian, Min, Zhe, Shan, Sui, Xin, Gan, Kang, as well as Ping, Jin, Jing, Hu, Yu, Shen, Han, Qing, Xi'an, Guangzhou, and other 24 provinces and cities. As a result of supplementing the deficit with the surplus and adjusting the surpluses to help the deficits, the grain shortage can only be made up by foreign grain. It was estimated in mid-May of this year that my country may import about 800,000 tons of foreign grain this year. If the national output this year is not lower than last year, what's more, the situation this year is obviously very different from last year, and the severity of the grain shortage problem can be imagined. Fortunately, in the future, the import of foreign grain will increase day by day. However, the fundamental way to solve the food shortage is to actively carry out production increase work, and the passive method should be to save food as much as possible. In addition, talking about the issue of food allocation in Jiangsu this year, he said that this is the most important work, which has been actively carried out by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Provincial Farmland and Grain Office. The Ministry of Food will do its best to assist and supervise it, because the stability of grain prices in various parts of Jiangsu often has a cause-and-effect relationship with Beijing and Shanghai, especially today after the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures.

Finally, we talked about the price of grain after the new grain came on the market. When the reporter mentioned that the price of new grain in some areas was obviously catching up with the old grain, he seemed to sigh and say: The situation this year is different from previous years, but the hoarding wind can be expected to gradually decrease and even disappear under the strict laws and regulations of strengthened control.

### Emergency Meeting of the Economic Supervision Committee Decides to Restrict the Transportation of Cotton Cloth to the South, and Temporarily Mark Cooking Oil Raw Materials for Export for Three Months

[Our Dispatch] At 10 a.m. yesterday, Liu Gongyun and Jiang Jingguo convened an emergency meeting in the president's office of the National Bank to discuss the issue of stabilizing the prices of several necessities in the city. More than ten people, including Chen Liang, Wu Guozhen, Wu Kaixian, Yang Chuo'an, Zhang Yujiu, Li Lixia, Lin Chongyong, and Chen Shuhui, attended and passed several important cases. Among them, regarding the cooking oil part, it was decided to telegraph the Executive Yuan to issue an order prohibiting the export of rapeseed oil, soybean oil, sesame oil, peanut oil, and their raw materials, with a temporary period of three months. For cooking oil rotation, it is necessary to consider the actual needs of various cities in South China and limit it. If there is a surplus of cooking oil and its raw materials, the China Trust Bureau or other institutions will be entrusted to purchase it.

Another dispatch: At 4 p.m. yesterday, Liu Gongyun and Jiang Jingguo convened another meeting to discuss the issue of cotton cloth. Wu Guozhen, Wu Kaixian, Dong Yunzhang, Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Li Lixia, Lin Chongyong, and Liu Jianqun attended. The following cases were decided: (1) Submit a request to the Executive Yuan to restrict the transportation of cotton cloth to the south, and authorize the Economic Control Supervisor of the Shanghai District to negotiate and implement the measures. (2) The Construction Bank and the Central Bank will sell off within the price limit of August 19th from today (26th) according to the listing method. (3) Designate a special person to negotiate on US aid cotton to ensure that it is promptly allocated to various yarn factories. In addition, several other important cases were passed.

Another dispatch: Regarding the approved sales price of Taiwan sugar, the original selling price per city picul on the 19th of this month was equivalent to 30 gold yuan, 1 jiao and 7 fen. Yesterday's approved sales price was 27 yuan, 1 jiao and 1 gold yuan per city picul. After Liu Gongyun negotiated with Taiwan Sugar Company, it was decided that the approved sales price in the future should be below the "819" price limit.

### Credit is Loose and Abundant, People's Hearts are Firm, Cotton Yarn Market Rises to the Limit, Cotton Cloth is Stable and Turning Upbeat as Harvest Approaches

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was quite firm due to the trend of loose credit in the industry. However, the morale in the market was idle. In order to comply with the economic control measures, the association authorities informed the industry at around 11 a.m. that all transactions in the market must be converted and traded according to the market price on the 19th, and the gold yuan price converted from the market price on the 19th was announced. However, the shouting prices mostly rose to the limit (the cotton yarn market price in this newspaper's market price list is published according to the association's market price), but both buyers and sellers held a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, only four transaction orders were made in the morning, with a total of 14 transactions.

Yesterday, when the cotton cloth market opened in the morning, the chairman of the association came to the market to state the intentions of the authorities, saying that it must not exceed the price limit to avoid being punished. The legal profit will naturally be required to be guaranteed, and the Fangjian Company is requested to fully allocate Longxian fine cloth and Sijunzi yuan serge to meet market sales. At this time, a large number of economic police personnel arrived, heavily guarded, and monitored the transactions.

When the twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth opened for trading, the shouting price fell by 1 yuan and 3 jiao. There were rumors that cotton yarn was prohibited from being exported, and the next day, more Longxian cloth came out, and the market was hovering around a corner. Later, because the Hankou gang made some progress and the market credit was loose, the market also turned upbeat, and it returned to 29 yuan and 2 jiao. The Five Blessings trumpet cloth fell by 1 to 5 jiao, and the Sijunzi yuan serge trade was more active, returning to 5 jiao (still 2 jiao short of the 19th). The local white grey cloth and colored cloth and other government cloths mostly showed a flat and tired state, with a total turnover of 1,440 bolts.

Another dispatch: In the afternoon, the authorities sent economic police personnel to strictly patrol the transactions outside the market, and merchants rarely dared to take the risk, so there was no news of trading.

Another dispatch: According to industry insiders, the main reason for the recent market firmness is that Fangjian Company has not opened sales of high-end goods for several periods, and the market turnover is lacking. At the same time, credit is extremely loose, and external floating capital has infiltrated activities, causing people's hearts to be optimistic and the number of buyers to increase. The industry has turned upbeat, and the rising trend has started. How the future changes will depend on whether Fangjian Company supplies as much as possible, which is the main key to the market price fluctuations.

### China Textile National Bank Sells Cotton Yarn

The China Textile Retail Department sold 652 pieces of yarn yesterday, equivalent to 1253 and a half pieces of 20 counts, totaling 530,336 gold yuan. It also sold 481 pieces on behalf of the Central Bank, with an amount of 313,490 gold yuan.

### Rayon Allocation Price Decided

Yesterday, the China Trust Bureau rayon meeting decided to resume the allocation of rayon. The rayon allocation price for the week from August 23 to August 28 is 888.60 gold yuan per box.

### Silk Production and Sales Guidance Committee Holds 51st Meeting

[Report from our newspaper] The Agricultural, Forestry, Industrial, and Commercial Silk Production and Sales Guidance Committee held its 51st committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 24th) in the conference room of the Chinese Farmers Bank on the Bund. More than ten committee members were present, including Chen Ai-shi, Ge Jing-zhong, Wang Bo-tian, He Mo-lin, and Diao Min-ren. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Tan Xi-hong, the chairman of the committee.

(A) Report Items: (1) Reading of the minutes of the previous meeting; (2) Letter from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau stating that raw silk inspection is entering the peak season, requesting that factories be notified to report no more than the limited amount of raw silk for inspection each day.

Discussion Items: (1) Regarding the calculation of various items in the reeling labor costs for July and the first half of August based on the price index, since the Price Index of the Four Joint Offices is not published, it is proposed to change the calculation to the Shanghai Municipal Government Price Index. Proposal for discussion. Resolution passed; (2) Letter from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau stating that the bundling materials used for raw silk inspection should be purchased by the applicant in the future. How should this be handled? Proposal for discussion. Resolution: For the bundling materials used for the loan manufacturers' cocoon reeling and inspection, the committee will send a letter to the Silk Reeling Industry Association to inform all manufacturers to pay in advance and then request settlement from the Central Trust Bureau; (3) Letters from the Hangzhou Municipal Government and the Silk Reeling Association requesting to increase workers' wages and meal allowances. How should we reply? Proposal for discussion. The wages for workers in the Sheng County area and Hangzhou area are calculated at one yuan, while the base salary for workers in the Shanghai area is calculated at one yuan and eight cents (the above base salaries include meals); (4) The reeling labor costs and silk purchase prices for the second half of July and the first half of August have been calculated. It is proposed to lend reeling labor costs and purchase based on the calculated prices. Proposal for discussion. Resolution: Please have China Morning Post, the Central Trust Bureau, and this committee jointly send personnel to recalculate and quickly request the loan team of the Four Joint Offices to verify and transfer to the Central Farmers Bank for lending.

### Excess Funds from Banks and Bureaus Concentrated in Central Bank

[Report from our newspaper] The Secretariat of the Four Joint Offices recently informed the Central Bank that excess funds from national banks and bureaus should be concentrated in the Central Bank in accordance with regulations. As for the transfer of funds for joint loans by various branches, it can be done by application or by issuing Central Bank checks as originally scheduled. The Central Bank has already notified its branches accordingly.

### Sluggish Sales and Meager Transactions; Rice Market Trends Weaken Again; Flour Slightly Increases, Edible Oil Prices Stabilize

The rice market initially rose and then weakened, attempting to increase power but instead seeing a price drop. When the market opened, cargo owners felt that the rice price had been too low the previous day, so they tried to raise it, initially shouting for a five-cent increase. However, due to sluggish sales and meager transactions, the price quickly returned to the original level. Later, due to abundant supply and weak demand, there was a slight decline. At the Nanshi market, both white glutinous rice and early rice fell by five cents, Xian rice also dropped by five cents, while thin rice and new glutinous rice remained at the original price. The Beishi market was relatively stable, with medium-grade early thin rice reduced by thirty-five cents, while the rest remained flat. New Yang Xian rice debuted at 18.5 yuan, with 4,067 piculs arriving yesterday.

Flour slightly increased because factories had not been releasing goods for several days. The market was short of goods, especially old brands such as Lao Che, which were scarce and expensive. Miscellaneous brands were more stable. Bingshen flour opened at seven yuan and later rose to 7.15 yuan. Lao Che was at 7.35 yuan. Jiancheng and Hongfeng each opened at 7.13 yuan, an increase of 1.5 to 2 cents. Miscellaneous brands Changcheng and Fenghuang slightly increased, while the rest remained stable. Bran slightly fell by five cents, wheat factory price at 7.7 yuan.

Miscellaneous grains were firm and stable. In order to encourage the industry not to exceed the limit price, the market announced the standard price on August 19th yesterday, and most transactions were opened at the limit price. Hankou Zhazadou was 10.033 yuan, Meiqing and Dongdou were opened at the limit price, corn and Yuanmai sales were still good in the northern gang, plus five cents, new corn was 12.5 yuan, tea beans were stable, broad beans had no changes, sesame was stable, raw kernels had transactions at the limit price, but there were not many sellers.

Edible oil prices hovered at the limit price. The price of raw oil was three yuan away from the limit price the previous day, but it jumped to the limit price of 64 yuan (per barrel) yesterday, an increase of three yuan. The factory and recycling of soybean oil released goods, and the price was five cents lower than the closing price of the previous day. The soybean oil of each factory was mostly 51.5 yuan, and raw rapeseed oil was 46.5 yuan. The market said it was stable. Small cart sesame oil opened at the original price, bean cake slightly increased by one or two cents, but there were not many transactions.

### Money Market Increasingly Loose; Banks and Bureaus Overdraw Again

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday was the third day of the issuance of gold yuan, and the money market was increasingly loose. The underground interest rate fell steadily, reaching a minimum of 0.15 yuan, which was in line with the bank's lending interest rate. The average interbank lending rate was 0.2 yuan. National banks and bureaus overdrew another 50,000 yuan, of which the Central Bank issued 1.61 million yuan, the large exchange entered 840,000 yuan, foreign merchants issued 520,000 yuan, the small exchange issued 270,000 yuan, China entered 220,000 yuan, Transportation entered 820,000 yuan, China Agricultural entered 20,000 yuan, China Trust entered 130,000 yuan, Postal Remittance entered 200,000 yuan, and the Cooperative Treasury entered 80,000 yuan. The exchange exchanged 201,133 instruments, with a total exchange amount of 59,869,162.24 yuan.

### Nationwide Cotton Production Estimate; Jiangsu Has the Highest Output

[Report from our newspaper] The National Textile Federation and the Cotton Production Improvement Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry jointly released the first national cotton production estimate report for this year. This estimate is based on the survey estimates from seventeen provinces including Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Liaoning, Longxi, Yunnan, Taiwan, and Ningxia, using the situation at the end of July this year as the standard.

This year, the cotton fields in these seventeen provinces totaled 3,756,400 Chinese acres, with a production of 1,133,200 piculs, compared to the final estimate of 3,886,100 Chinese acres and a production of 1,102,300 piculs last year. The cotton fields decreased by 129,700 Chinese acres, but the production still increased by 30,900 piculs, which is commendable.

Among the seventeen provinces, Jiangsu Province has the highest output, with a total of 2,286,000 piculs, an increase of 98,000 piculs compared to last year. If the public security in northern Jiangsu were not affected, the output would have been even higher. The second is Hubei with 1,866,000 piculs, and the third is Shandong with 1,610,000 piculs. However, due to public security reasons in Hubei, this year's output has decreased sharply (according to last year's output of 6,241,000 piculs). Other provinces such as Shaanxi and Zhejiang have also achieved good results in increasing production, with Shaanxi at 1,115,000 piculs and Zhejiang at 495,000 piculs.

The provinces with the largest production reductions are Henan, Hunan, and Liaoning, either due to war or floods, all of which have decreased sharply. Henan is estimated at 934,000 piculs, Hunan at 220,000 piculs, and Liaoning at only 10,000 piculs.

### Designated Banking Association Holds Meeting to Discuss Foreign Exchange Transactions

[Report from our newspaper] The Designated Banking Association of this city held a temporary general membership meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday to discuss foreign exchange transactions after the currency reform. The result was a resolution:

(1) Regarding the question of how to unify the foreign exchange quotations reported by various banks, it was resolved that, in principle, the buying and selling prices should still be calculated by deducting the 1.25% handling fee, and the remainder should be determined at their discretion.

(2) The previous request to the Central Bank to recall the foreign exchange settlement certificates was not intended by the national banks. It was resolved to continue to buy and sell them in the market, and the importers and exporters would automatically balance the chips.

(3) The national banks gave an interest rate of 0.18 yuan for all forward foreign exchange held by exporters, which seemed too low. However, since the national banks have approved exporters' forward foreign exchange positions that have not yet expired to be sold back to the national banks early, the interest rate issue is no longer very important.

### Various Major Exports Implement Price Limits

[Report from our newspaper] In order to increase exports, the Export Control Committee has implemented price limits for major exports starting from the 24th of this month. The price of tung oil is set at 0.2 US dollars per pound, and the price of pig bristles (Tianjin No. 55 long) is 9.1 US dollars per pound. A contract has been signed with the British Food Department for ice eggs, with a delivery price of 204 pounds and 5 shillings per picul in Shanghai. The most common quality straw hats are priced at 5 US dollars per dozen. The price of tea is still being drafted. As for the price of raw silk, the domestic price is 2.9 US dollars per pound for D-grade raw silk, while the US market price is above 3 US dollars. The international market price is already higher than the domestic price, so price limits are no longer needed.

### Export Merchants Hope for Improvement

The Import and Export Management Committee has implemented price limits on exports in line with the Economic Emergency Disposal Order, which has aroused strong resentment among export merchants. According to the person in charge of the export industry yesterday, this year's export business has been unable to prosper before the currency reform. This is because the domestic export commodity prices are too high, and there is no profit to be made when shipping them abroad. After the currency reform, domestic prices can be more stable, and the export sector is planning to strengthen exports to seize the foreign market and lay the foundation for the foreign market. The Import and Export Management Committee's implementation of the price limit system is tantamount to preventing the development of the export business. The yarn and cloth market in various parts of Nanyang is currently being dumped by Japanese goods at depreciated prices. Our country should also depreciate and sell them to seize the market position. In Africa, tea and other goods can also be transported and sold to seize the previous market. If restrictions are imposed, so that export goods cannot be exported at lower prices, it will be a great obstacle to the export sector. It is hoped that the Import and Export Management Committee can have supplementary measures to improve the situation.

Another news item: The Import and Export Management Committee, in accordance with Article 9 of the government's announcement on the management of finances and strengthening economic controls regarding import and export management measures, stipulates that the import quota should be reduced by one-quarter from the seventh quarter, and for goods imported outside the quota, a number of goods are designated to allow merchants to apply for export. However, this provision is only in principle and there are no specific measures. In order to prevent the cessation of import and export work, the committee dispatched its deputy director Deng Youjin to Nanjing last night to ask the Executive Yuan for instructions, and then discuss the specific implementation rules.

### Adjustment of Internal Exchange Rates by Banks and Bureaus

The internal exchange rates of the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury will be revised as follows from the 26th: Xiamen 20 yuan, Fuzhou 50 yuan, Quanzhou 40 yuan, Guangzhou, Shantou, Zhanjiang, Haikou 40 yuan each, Guilin, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, Nanning 25 yuan each. Changsha, Hengyang, Yuanling 50 yuan each.

Towns along the Beijing-Shanghai line 8 yuan each, Chongqing, Chengdu, Wanxian 95 yuan each, Wuhan 50 yuan each, Shashi, Yichang 95 yuan each, Pingjin 10 yuan each, Qingdao 10 yuan, Jingdezhen, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Jian, Ganzhou 95 yuan each.

Hangzhou 8 yuan, Jiaxing 10 yuan, Wenzhou 95 yuan, Ningbo 10 yuan, Shaoxing, Huzhou 15 yuan each, Hefei, Anqing 50 yuan each, Tunxi 60 yuan, Wuhu 50 yuan, Bengbu 40 yuan, Shexian 60 yuan, Henan area 90 yuan, Guizhou 95 yuan, Yunnan 95 yuan, Shaanxi, Gansu 20 yuan each, Ningqing. Xikang, Suiyuan, Xinjiang 30 yuan each, other places unchanged.

### Increased Taxes on Cigarettes, Foreign Liquor, etc.

[Report from our newspaper] The Jianghai Customs issued a bulletin yesterday, roughly stating that they had received a government order to increase the tax rate on cigarettes and foreign liquor and beer to 120%, and the tax rate on beverages to 30%. They were ordered to comply. Therefore, in addition to complying and implementing it from August 23rd of this year, this announcement is hereby issued for general knowledge.

### Board of Directors of the Banking Association Discusses the Capital Issue of Banks

[Report from our newspaper] The Banking Association of this city convened a joint meeting of the Board of Directors yesterday afternoon starting at 2:30 PM. Representatives from the money industry and trust industry participated, with a total of more than 30 people present. Li Ming, Chairman of the Banking Association, presided over the meeting. The meeting discussed in detail the adjustment of the capital of the financial industry.

During the meeting, everyone believed that the minimum capital amount for banks currently set by the government was too high, and the banks felt that they could not afford it. Furthermore, the plan formulated by the Banking Association was not discussed because the principle of capital amount could not be resolved. Until about 6 o'clock, there was still no concrete resolution. Finally, it was decided to wait quietly for the government authorities to announce the implementation of the capital adjustment method and how the capital of national banks and bureaus would be adjusted for reference, and then make a decision.

After the meeting, Sun Chu-ren, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, made a statement on behalf of the association, stating that based on statistical figures and reasoning, the total deposits of banks in Shanghai in 1937 were approximately 4 billion yuan, and the total issuance was approximately 1.4 billion yuan. At that time, the total capital of banks in Shanghai was approximately 400 million yuan, which was approximately one-tenth of the total deposits and a little more than one-third of the total issuance.

If the trust companies and banks in Shanghai are now required to increase their capital to 1 million gold yuan, and the money shops are required to increase their capital to 500,000 gold yuan, with 105 banks (excluding national banks, provincial and municipal banks, and foreign banks) having a capital of 1 million gold yuan each, and 90 money shops and trust companies having a capital of 500,000 yuan each, the total capital would increase to 150 million gold yuan, equivalent to 450 trillion legal tender yuan, which is approximately three-quarters of the current total national issuance. If the capital of national banks and bureaus is added, it can almost reach the entire amount of issuance. Compared with the current total deposits, the deposits of Shanghai commercial banks and trust companies in June totaled 13 trillion legal tender yuan, equivalent to 4.53 million gold yuan. In the past, capital was one-tenth of the amount of deposits, but today capital is 30 times the amount of deposits. Nothing could be more reversed.

He further stated that the capital of each bank has been approved by the Ministry of Finance, but is not recognized due to the currency reform, which is unreasonable.

### United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) General Assembly Approves Holding a Research Conference in the Far East; Guo Youshou Reports to Reporters at the Ministry of Education Yesterday

[Nanjing, Our Newspaper, 25th] UNESCO is composed of 44 countries with a staff of 600 people. There are ten countries from the Far East Asia participating, but there are too few staff, which inevitably leads to separation. Therefore, the organization specially raised the salary of Educational Inspector Guo Youshou and reassigned him as an education consultant, using this to contact and liaise with various countries in the Far East Asia to find professional talents to join UNESCO's work. Mr. Guo departed from Paris in early June, and traveled through eight countries including Ceylon, Dutch East Indies, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Philippines, India, Burma, and Siam, arriving back in our capital on the 24th. At 5 pm on the 25th, he met with reporters at the Ministry of Education to report on the participation of various countries in UNESCO, and shared his impressions. He noted that Afghanistan provides preferential treatment to students from elementary school to university, and education is developed. Education in India is also making great strides, and women are enthusiastic about participating in politics. He also said that UNESCO has held academic research conferences, all of which were in Western countries. He proposed to hold a research conference in the Far East, which has been approved by the General Assembly, to be held in China and India in the Far East. Mr. Guo was in India, and the Indian authorities advocated holding it in India. After Mr. Guo returned to China, our government also wished to hold it in our country, and planned to ask Dr. Hu Shi to accept the preparations, and entrusted Mr. Guo to go to Peiping to discuss matters. But the final decision must be made by UNESCO. UNESCO can subsidize 30,000 US dollars for this research conference for the purpose of hiring teachers. It is also scheduled to host a cultural event on the 27th, and then go to Peiping and various parts of Japan on the 28th before returning to Paris.

In total, it has recruited approximately 270 new graduates from 30 universities including National Central University this year. The scope of employment includes 24 departments such as electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, mining and metallurgy, and management.

It also distributes Taiwan students to work in the mainland as much as possible to enhance their feelings and understanding of the motherland and promote cultural exchange. The NRC's principles for selecting new university graduates are roughly as follows: (1) According to the business needs of each unit, the number of employees needed is determined based on their situation, and universities are requested to recommend twice the number of students. (2) The country is divided into seven regions including Beijing, Shanghai, Taiwan, and Tianjin, and each business unit should employ new graduates from universities in the same region as much as possible. (3) The selection criteria are based on the average grades of the recommended students, and interviews are conducted separately to determine the selection. (4) Students who receive scholarships from the NRC have priority in distribution according to their wishes. It is learned that the NRC's employment of new university graduates this year has been approved and will be announced at the end of the month, and the recommended universities and relevant units have been notified that the employed students can complete the registration procedures in early September.

### Meeting of City Middle School Principals Discusses Tuition Fees for the Next Semester; Heated Discussion Without a Decision; Representatives from the Teachers' Union Attend to Advocate for Professional Development Fees

[Report from our newspaper] The principals of municipal secondary schools in this city gathered at Yucaizhongxue on Shankuaiguan Road at 4 pm yesterday to discuss the issue of tuition fees. More than 20 principals from various schools attended, and the meeting was chaired by Zhu Bihui, the principal of the senior nursing school. Director Li of the City Education Bureau also attended. The heated discussion lasted for three and a half hours without a decision. Director Li will submit the standards proposed by each school and the standards of the Education Bureau to Mayor Wu for approval.

Teachers' Professional Development Fees

The most heated discussion during the meeting was whether to continue collecting teachers' professional development fees. Two representatives from the Municipal Secondary School Teachers' Union attended and requested that the collection of teachers' professional development fees be continued, with half of the fees borne by the city government and half by the students' parents, to subsidize the lives of teachers.

Agreed on Tuition Fees

Finally, it was agreed that the tuition fees for junior high school should be 28 gold yuan, and the tuition fees for senior high school should be 32 gold yuan, both including 10 yuan for teachers' professional development fees. The principals believed that the low tuition fees before the war could be maintained because the school's office expenses and temporary expenses were sufficient. Now, the school's office expenses are not enough to pay for water and electricity fees, so they must rely on tuition fees to maintain operations.

Education Bureau Proposes Standards

Director Li proposed that the tuition fee standard for junior high school is 21 gold yuan, and the tuition fee standard for senior high school is 25 gold yuan. Starting this semester, each school should pay attention to promoting sports and strengthening sports activities, so it is specifically stipulated that the sports fee for senior and junior high schools is 2 yuan, and the tuition fee is 1 yuan. The remaining 18 yuan for junior high school and 22 yuan for senior high school are allocated for other expenses. Director Li will report to Mayor Wu for approval.

### Crickets

— Ji Yong

"Another year passes easily with the autumn wind." Although the line of poetry is cliché, when the season arrives, it will give people endless sighs. These two days, the盂蘭盆會 is being performed in the evening, with 法鼓 and 金鐃, and the金元法幣 is being discussed during the day, in street talks and alley discussions. We sour literati and pedantic scholars, who have always lacked the ability to bear burdens, are the most peaceful and content at this time. We have never wronged anyone in our lives, so we certainly don't need to spend money on repentance. American dollars, gold, and silver do not belong to us, so there is no need for worry or panic. It's cooler in the evening, and the moonlight is just beginning to rise. Listening to the sounds of "唧唧啾啾" from the grass clumps in the corner of the wall, "A single leaf can welcome intention, a tiny insect can draw the heart." This is my world. No wonder since the Three Hundred Poems, the songs of the Han and Wei dynasties, poets have liked to use autumn insects as their rhyme.

The earliest cricket to enter poetry is, of course, the Tang Feng Cricket chapter. Today, when I flipped through Zhu Chuan and reread it, I felt that the people of the north, such as Wei and Tang, have never lived very well. The first four lines of Cricket, "蟋蟀在堂，歲聿其莫，今我不樂，日月其除!" are clearly a complaining tone, very similar in meaning to the closely connected poem "The Mountain has a Pivot, the Marsh has a Elm." Leaving this aside, the cricket entering the hall and the end of the year naturally means that the ancient and modern calendars are different. The 風 in July: "七月在野，八月在宇，九月在戶，十月蟋蟀入我床下," is an even more famous line. Here, it clearly states that the cricket in the hall is in October. Zhou Zhengjianzi, October is the end of the year, which is a very accurate statement. However, I don't know why, in the north today, there are very few who can still hear crickets in the Little Spring of October. Could it be that the ancient and modern climates are different? Banner people often use gourds to raise crickets, which can be used to get through the winter. This is another way to prolong life. Relying on high gates is different in character from self-sheltering with an acorn.

Although Chinese people have had a tradition of happily forgetting about nature since ancient times, which has been praised by foreigners, the secular view is mostly utilitarian. Poets look at "衆鳥欣有託" or "草長鶯飛," while ordinary people must put the birds in cages to play with their chirping feathers, and they can also be sold at a low price. Tiny insects like crickets cannot avoid this. It can only be said that it is because of "蘭膏自煎熬，多才爲患害?" Although crickets chirp clearly in autumn, in fact, no one appreciates this瞿瞿 sound, and they cruelly watch them fight. Prime Minister Banxiantang played with them first, and Emperor Xuanzong of the Ming Dynasty continued after him. Reading the "Promoting Weaving" article in Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio makes people feel indignant. It turns out that in addition to the disasters of the three officials and three farewells in the autocratic era, there was also this abusive government that entertained the eyes and ears! Fortunately, we are exempt from this in the democratic era, which is the happiest thing for us.

Zhuangzi's account of Bian Zhuangzi watching tigers fight is always somewhat immoral. If measured by the words of the old man from Han Yin, this is also one end of the machine heart. The reason why people are different from animals is very small. This is probably one or two of what is hoped for. The so-called "庶民去之君子存之" was originally to raise the value of gentlemen, but in fact, according to my view above, it just explains that gentlemen are not able to become things. Mencius's words are not very different from Confucius's. Confucius would say honest words like "Advanced in ritual and music, barbarians also," but Mencius insisted on saying this kind of delusional talk that did not conform to the facts. Later generations, such as Han Tuizhi, were all annoying ghosts with this kind of delusional slogan. I'm straying too far from the topic. Now we're still back to crickets. What I want to say is nothing more than the feeling of watching two little insects fighting hard. Even the dead ones are scolded as "廢料, 不行!" and the winners are appreciated for their "翹然長鳴." I really don't know what kind of mentality this is! Gu Tieqing's "French Records" records that Wu men fighting crickets is even more terrible:

"Around the White Dew Festival, crickets are tamed and raised for the pleasure of gambling fights, which is called autumn interest, commonly known as fighting humility. Carrying cages to look at each other, forming teams and groups, calling their insects generals, with big heads and long feet being valuable, and blue, yellow, red, black and white primary colors being superior. The sizes are similar, and the weights are exactly the same. Then the gate is opened. Sometimes there are those who hold grass to attract enemies, which is called enemy grass. The two sides recognize the color, either red or green, which is called marking the head. The audience below the stage uses the victory or defeat on the stage as the basis for winning or losing, which is called sticking to the door. Dividing the chips is called flowers. Flowers are false names, with one hundred and twenty copper coins as one flower, from one flower to hundreds or thousands of flowers, depending on the agreement between the two families. The winner gets the prize, and the loser loses money, without any cost of words."

Look at this scene, how does it compare to watching horse racing at the racecourse or watching dog racing at Yiyuan?

Autumn evenings are originally extremely quiet, but the children next door, holding 洋燈盆水, immediately run over to pour it wherever they hear a cry, and they won't stop until they get the insects out. By the next morning, most of them have died in battle or been trampled and discarded, so they catch new ones again. If insects have knowledge, what would they say?

### Record of Dalongqiu

— Shi Shufan

The autumn heat is still fierce, and the evening lamp breeds sweat. In my dreams on the pillow, I often fall between the mountains and rivers of Yongjia. I remember that I traveled extensively in the old Yandang, taking the road through Shanshan Pond in Wenling. The蒲帆 sailed the sea for thirty miles, reaching Baixi Town. Then, I followed 谢公, stopping at the Longqiu Pavilion. It was after the rain, and reading Kang Nanhai's "There is water from heaven" sentence often described the reality. I also once wrote a long song, regretting that there was no way to exhaust its magnificence.

On the fifth day of the sixth month, I made a trip to Yandang. The God of Heaven first rained for three days, preparing for me to accumulate momentum and strengthen the Longqiu. I set off from Shashan Ferry in the morning, drank at the Baixi Tower at noon, and listened to the "Vimalakirti Sutra" bell at night. The rustling of pine wishes has not yet stopped. I rushed out in草鞋. The sparrows were startled and chirped, blaming me for not being strong enough to kill the thieves, and for making hard山水 a warning. Crossing the Saddle Ridge, the stream was steep稠. The thin ones split their toes, and the high ones refused to stab my eyes. The firm thunder overturned under my crotch with sand, and I went straight in without looking back. For ten years, I have vowed to seek seclusion here. Water, water, I have already seen it flowing on the horizon: quite like white cloth thrown from above, who is pulling it is difficult to find? The sound is vast and the wind is whistling. The sixth month in front of me turns into a cool autumn, more than three feet wide and unable to be rolled up. It is thrown into the bottom of the pool and then drawn upside down, and snowflakes splash on the trees, all foam. I think the stone gate is tricky without being straight and forceful, and what I saw in Lushan cannot be so magnificent and repaired. Suddenly there is sadness, and the sky is also worried, should water be a plan for the ears and eyes, and wash away the shame of Qianbei for all ages! Can the Taoist priest in the tower understand? At dusk, the peak turned into a red skull.

### Thirteen Affairs of Yuan Hanyun

— Chen Zuogao

Mr. Yuan Hanyun, among the sons of Xiangcheng, is known for his才不. His affairs are spread and can be used as a talk after wine and tea. Mr. Yuan ranked second, named Ke Wen, and his style name was Bao Cen (according to one saying, when he was born, Xiangcheng dreamed of a foreigner carrying a small golden leopard to see him, so based on the meaning of the Book of Changes, he was given the name). His other style name was Baocun, and his nickname was Hanyun. His birth mother was from Korea, and his bloodline was transmitted, so his skin was especially fair. As a child, he was clever and had the reputation of a child prodigy. He first studied under Fang Dishan, and his poems and ancient springs inherited the new tradition. Later, he appraised ancient artifacts from Xuan Guyu; he examined the version from Li Shengduo. Throughout his life, he was respectful of the three sons. First of all, when Xiangcheng was in power, he lived in the Liushuiyin in the former palace, and the guests were often full, and the famous people gathered together. In addition to his best friend Bu Linwu, the poets Yi Shifu and Luo Yinggong (Yi Luo's anecdotes are many, which will be recorded in another article) and others came every day, lingering in literature and wine, no different from immortals.

Hanyun was both excellent and talented. He did not fail to participate in calligraphy, prose, and textual research. However, the art of calligraphy was especially outstanding and famous in the world. He practiced Liu in his early years, and in his later years, he participated in Dengshan's brushwork. His brushwork was thin, hard, round, and strong. As a result, he changed his posture and established his own style. When he was writing small characters, he often leaned back to write. When writing couplets, he suspended his wrist in the air, so that he could write large and small characters at will, without any regrets. After Bingyin, he changed his signature to Hanyun, written in seal script and cursive script, and the signature was like forty-two. Because his concubine's name was Wenxue, he also created a seal, with the inscription Hanyun Wenxue.

Mr. Yuan was also skilled in poetry and lyrics, such as the Lyrics to the Tune Remembering Little Peach Red for Lin Baishui, or the lyrics mourning the old events of Hongxian, or lamenting the restoration of the chaos. The sound outside the strings makes people fascinated when reading it. In Bingyin, Kuang Huifeng died on the sea, and he wrote a mourning couplet: "Compared to Mengchuang Baishi, the old inn became a home, with low singing and light drinking, a generation of lyricists will last forever. Tracing back to Ou Yin's Canlu, we talked about hard work together, sad and small building Qingye, how many times have we met in Jiang country in ten years." The sorrow for the virtuous is unbearable.

Hanyun tried to expand his collection of Song and Yuan good books, which were countless. The most precious ones, about 200 kinds, were especially painted in the study with the inscription "One Collection of Two Hundred Song Books Every Day." The collection of Liu Hedong's Fish Mysterious Machines was even more extensive. Therefore, his collection of books was famous all over the world. Any Song or Yuan edition, once inscribed, can be sold at a good price. Those who know the goods allowed the solitary copy in the sea, and almost included it, only one person after Huang Xiaopu. The rest of the collection includes postal stamps, gold pounds, small bronze wares, ancient coins, seals, and fan bones. When appreciating and appraising them, he often拓朱钤 and attached them to his diary. His interests and hobbies were not constant. He would take and abandon things at will. For example, when he became interested in collecting stamps, he would spend a lot of money to buy them. One day, he would easily become fond of ancient coins, and then sell his old collection and abandon it like worn shoes. In addition to ancient books, he never possessed two things at the same time for a long time, and things were never favored for many years. Only the half-wall book city remained forever.

It was the same with people. He easily changed his concubines, all of whom were produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, such as Qiongji, Fengzhu, Xiaoyingying, and Peiwen. Looking at the words of Huanxisha and Butterfly Love Flowers, the style is romantic, just like Zhang Xu back then. He was sincerely faithful to the divine path, and went to the Jigong altar to fortune his life, and obtained twelve poems, each of which must have hidden the name of each concubine, and later it was effective (only to the ninth concubine, he suddenly thanked the world). Every New Year's Day, he must kowtow to the statue of Jigong. According to himself, the reason why he played the world and did not respect it was that he had unspeakable pain, that is, he called himself the second son of the emperor, and his participation in Anqing was also based on his helpless inner thoughts. The way to protect himself was probably in this.

When Xiangcheng passed away, thirty-three members of the family (including seventeen brothers and sixteen sisters) divided the inheritance equally, each receiving 90,000 in cash and 140,000 in real estate. At that time, Han初 received the property, came to Shanghai to live in Hongkou, and then moved to Baker Road (now next to the Sino-American Hospital) and Avenue Joffre. After two years of spending extravagantly, he finally became financially strapped and heavily indebted. He relied on mortgaging antiques until his death. Jin Lin

### A Good Official is Hard to Be

— Meng Zhou

A good official is hard to be, at home and abroad.

Former US Secretary of the Interior Ickes was fair and honest and was one of President Roosevelt's most admired "talents," but because he was iron-faced, selfless, and didn't show favoritism, he offended countless colleagues.

During World War II, because he felt that government departments were wasting too much paper on "official correspondence," he started with the Interior Department, which he was in charge of, and forbade his subordinates to waste paper. Unexpectedly, these subordinates had a considerable bureaucratic atmosphere. They were used to Ickes' anger on weekdays, so they took the opportunity to retaliate. They printed thousands of copies of any of Ickes' orders regarding saving paper, distributed them to forty-eight states, and then forwarded them to various counties and towns, which used up an unknown amount of paper. Furthermore, they printed countless documents and countless forms, requiring local agencies to report the monthly amount of paper consumed each month, and the states then forwarded the reports, which also used a lot of paper. Finally, they ordered each state to forward to each local agency, requiring them to submit written reports on their plans to save paper and monthly reports on the progress of implementing their plans to save paper - which used a lot more paper out of thin air.

Ickes made another effort, ordering that official documents should be as brief as possible, and that matters that could be explained in four sentences should not be lengthened into four paragraphs filled with "etc." and other nonsense and boilerplate language. The purpose: still to save paper. But those bureaucrats came up with another trick. When writing four paragraphs of text, they used a large letterhead, and when writing four sentences, they also used such a large piece of paper, so paper was still not saved. Ickes was angry, and then ordered that typing should be as dense as possible, and that official documents that could be written on half a sheet of paper should only use letterhead of half the size. His subordinates also obeyed him with a smile - but when filing, they decided to "make it easier to check" and pasted all the documents written on half a sheet of paper on large sheets of paper before classifying them and putting them away. Not only did it waste paper, but it also wasted a lot of staff time!

The allure of success in imperial examinations, besides the priority of all public power and practical benefits, also held some ethereal, supportive, and lingering charm, captivating the hearts of young men at the time, often comparing the triumph in the examination hall to the blissful honeymoon of a marriage. Phrases like "The wedding night in the bridal chamber, the moment of being named on the golden list," and "Within books, there naturally lies a house of gold; within books, there naturally lies a jade-like beauty," are beautiful words full of illusion. Similarly, "Re-celebrating in the Qionglin Garden" and "Re-celebrating the Deer Cry Banquet" can be compared to "Re-experiencing the wedding night," with their rich and intense interest.

Celebrating a 60th wedding anniversary is not a common occurrence, hence it's called a "Diamond Wedding." Assuming the man and woman were married at the age of twenty, they both have to live to eighty. One person reaching eighty is already a rarity of old, let alone a couple of old people re-dressing and re-worshiping in the wedding hall. The "re-celebration" of success in imperial examinations is also like this. Old men in their eighties or nineties, wearing flowers and red sashes, raising their cups to congratulate new young scholars, is also a sign of youthful spirit in old age. Therefore, although the imperial examination system has been abolished for many years, old licentiates and old graduates still cannot forget about it. Precisely because it is hard-earned, the interest is even stronger.

For example, Xu Shichang (from Shuizhu Village) died of illness in Dalian two years after the outbreak of the Incident (1939), at the age of eighty-five. He was a licentiate of the Renwu year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. He would have had to wait until the age of eighty-eight in the 31st year of the Republic (1942) to reach the age for "re-celebrating the Deer Cry Banquet," which was three years short. He became a licentiate at the age of twenty-eight, which was not too late, and he lived to the age of eighty-five, which was not short, but he still didn't catch up with the second "jiazi" of the provincial examination. Old man Yu Quyuan caught up with re-taking the provincial examination, but didn't catch up with re-taking the metropolitan examination. Among recent people who have twice re-encountered both the provincial and metropolitan examinations, one was Chen Baochen (the teacher of Puyi) from Fujian, a licentiate of the Jiazi year and a graduate of the Wuchen year of the Tongzhi reign. He encountered the Jiazi year again in the 13th year of the Republic (1924), at the age of seventy-seven. He encountered the Wucheng year again in the 17th year of the Republic (1928), at the age of eighty-one. He passed away seven years later, in the 24th year of the Republic (1935). He possessed two excellent conditions: (1) particularly early success in imperial examinations (becoming a graduate at the age of twenty-one); (2) longevity (eighty-eight years old); so he was so unhurried. Another person was Zhang Yinglin, a licentiate of the Wuwu year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty. He re-encountered the Wuwu year for the provincial examination in the 7th year of the Republic (1918); a graduate of the Yichou year of the Tongzhi reign, he re-encountered the Yichou year in the 14th year of the Republic (1925); but he soon passed away, also at the age of eighty-eight. Another person was Wu Yusheng from Suzhou, a licentiate of the Yihai year of the Guangxu reign (a classmate of Chen Sanli), at the age of twenty-two. He re-encountered the Yihai year in the 24th year of the Republic (1935); his graduate year was the Dingchou year, at the age of twenty-four, and he re-encountered the Dingchou year in the 26th year of the Republic (1937, the year of the July 7th Incident). He passed away in Qingdao four years later. He also possessed the two conditions of "early success in imperial examinations" and "longevity." (All three of the above entered the Hanlin Academy.)

Qu Hongji became a graduate and entered the Hanlin Academy at the age of twenty-two (Xinwei year of the Tongzhi reign). His success in imperial examinations came very early, but unfortunately, he only lived to the age of sixty-nine and passed away in Shanghai in the Wuwu year of the Republic (1919). (If he had lived to the Gengwu year of the Republic (1930), he would have re-encountered the provincial examination; in the Xinwei year (1931), he would have been able to re-encounter the metropolitan examination.) And as for Cai Yuanpei and Xiong Bingjian (Xiling), both were licentiates and graduates in their twenties, achieving success in their youth, but regrettably, their lifespans did not reach eighty years. (Both Cai and Xiong passed away in Hong Kong at the beginning of the Incident. Cai was just over seventy, and Xiong was not yet seventy.)

This year is the old lunar year of Wuzi. There are two people in Beiping who are old enough to re-encounter the provincial examination. One is Zhang Kang, who died of illness after being convicted and released for holding a puppet position. The other is Chuan Zengxiang, who has been chronically ill and half paralyzed. Therefore, there is not much celebration to be done.
