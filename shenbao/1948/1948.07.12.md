### Tightening Currency to Stabilize Finances: The Government Decides to Release Large Quantities of Goods; Ministry of Finance Plans to Formulate Measures to Expedite Disposal at Adjusted Prices

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] To tighten the currency and stabilize finances, the government has decided to continue selling goods it controls. It is estimated that a large amount of US surplus goods, enemy and puppet goods, and Japanese reparations goods will be sold in the second half of the year.

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] According to sources, regarding the annual income for the second half of the year, in addition to the ordinary tax revenue for which the Ministry of Finance has drafted reorganization and adjustment plans and is awaiting the Legislative Yuan's completion of the legislative process for implementation, the Ministry of Finance is also actively planning to continue selling US military surplus goods, enemy and puppet goods, and Japanese reparations goods. It is estimated that the sale of surplus goods and lend-lease materials can reach over 1,570,000 billion yuan, the sale of seized enemy and puppet properties and goods can reach 100,000 billion yuan, and the sale of Japanese reparations goods can reach 37,500 billion yuan. The Ministry of Finance has drafted measures to expedite the disposal of the aforementioned goods at adjusted prices and will urge the responsible agencies to step up processing and remit the proceeds to the national treasury.

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] The settlement of payments for US military surplus goods and lend-lease materials purchased by China during the war will soon be carried out. The bill from the United States has been sent to our country, and the relevant Chinese authorities are separately studying and calculating it. A meeting will be convened in the next few days to discuss settlement methods. It is reported that the settlement will be based on the condition that the goods have indeed arrived in our country and that our side has receipts.

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] The agreement and annexes on economic assistance between China and the United States and the exchange of notes on trade in the West German and Hong Kong areas (i.e., the Sino-US bilateral agreement and its annexes and exchange of notes), after being signed and announced in Beijing on the 3rd of this month by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs based on the Legislative Yuan's acceptance of aid and authorization to sign the agreement, were submitted to the Legislative Yuan by the Executive Yuan a day earlier for review and record. As this agreement and exchange of notes are administrative in nature and do not require review and approval, the Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee has listed the Executive Yuan's message as a reporting matter and will present it at the regular meeting on the 13th.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th Dispatch] Hoffman announced that the Economic Cooperation Administration has approved the purchase of materials to aid Europe and China for $26,616,750. So far, the amount of aid to China totals $27,788,300, of which $2,147,260 is used to purchase wheat and flour, $12,620,040 to purchase rice, $13 million to purchase cotton, and the remaining $1,112,100 is for shipping needs.

### Legislative Yuan's Committee Reviews Overall Budget in Groups: Preliminary Work Completed; Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics Submits Plan to Reform System

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] The Legislative Yuan continued to hold committee review meetings throughout the 11th. Except for the First Group, which was closed on Sundays, the remaining six groups gathered separately to secretly discuss the budgets of various government departments. It is reported that the Sixth Group has completed the review of the budget under the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the budget under the Ministry of Education is only awaiting a decision. The Seventh Group has also largely completed the review of the budget under the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Food. The work of the remaining groups has completed six or seven tenths. The budget committee decided that the seven groups would continue to meet on the 12th so that the preliminary group review could be completed on schedule; otherwise, the agenda would be postponed. The staff of the budget committee have been extremely busy these days. More than 50 staff members, led by Chief Secretary Wen Shourin, have been mobilized to work day and night, which is very hard work.

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics previously attached a policy plan to the budget for the second half of the year in accordance with the law. Of the six articles in the outline, three are related to system reform and the division of powers and responsibilities between the central and local governments. The main points are as follows: A. Re-establish the management system for local accounting personnel. The main points are as follows: (1) County-level key personnel are all appointed positions. Regardless of whether they are principals or assistants, their appointment, removal, transfer, and adjustment are handled by the provincial accounting agencies and implemented by the provincial government's orders. (2) The appointment, removal, transfer, and adjustment of provincial-level accounting personnel who are currently recommended positions are handled by the provincial accounting office; those who are simplified positions are handled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. (3) The appointment, removal, transfer, and adjustment of accounting personnel in municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan are handled in accordance with provincial-level examples, while accounting personnel in provincial-administered cities are handled in accordance with county-level examples. B. Adjust the organizational system of local accounting agencies. The main points are as follows: (1) As a principle, one accounting organization should be established for one agency. (2) If two organizations with equal rank were originally established, they should be merged and reorganized. If the ranks are unequal, the organization with the lower rank should be reorganized under the organization with the higher rank. (3) The accounting organizations within each agency should be named according to the organizational structure of each unit within the agency, with the word "accounting" prefixed. C. Revise the laws and regulations for local governments in provinces, cities, and counties to handle budgets. The budget law amended and promulgated in May of this year did not stipulate the procedures and powers for the compilation and review of local budgets in provinces, cities, and counties, and the methods implemented in the past are very different from the situation after the implementation of the constitution. It should be revised as soon as possible as a basis for handling the budget for the second half of the year. The principles of revision are as follows: (1) The county local budget should be discussed and decided by the county legislative body and implemented by the county government under the supervision of the provincial government. (2) The provincial local budget should be discussed and decided by the provincial legislative body and implemented by the provincial government under the supervision of the central government. (3) If the budget of a lower-level government involves the financial revenue and expenditure of a higher-level government, it should be approved by the higher-level government.

### Many Tourists in Kuling

Citizens Hope President and Wife Will Visit

[Our Kuling Office, 11th Dispatch] The number of tourists in Kuling is increasing daily, but because flights have been suspended for a week and there are not many boat trips, most tourists come from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Nanxun lines. The reporter recently completed a 42-hour journey, passing through the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Nanxun lines, and arrived in the Kuling urban area at 6:30 pm on the 10th. The Kuling city is very orderly, but there are many foreigners. The local citizens are eagerly hoping that the President and his wife will visit soon. The Jiangxi Daily reported on the 10th that the President will visit Kuling soon, which made the citizens very happy.

[Our Kuling Office, 11th Dispatch] Traveling to and from Shanghai and Kuling has been greatly facilitated by the dispatch of personnel from China Travel Service in various places. However, it was observed along the way that both Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces suffered from floods in the spring and summer. Rice fields submerged in water could be seen at any time on both sides of the railway, especially along the Nanxun line. Some rice fields could be traveled by boat, and three or five farmhouses became isolated islands. In Jiujiang, the water level of Gan Tang Lake rose, and boats could travel everywhere in the urban area, which made people deeply feel the severity of the floods.

### Air Force Day on August 14: Air Force Headquarters Holds Medal Presentation Ceremony

### Many Legislators Propose Strict Investigation of Funds Fleeing Abroad

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] Legislators Huang Tong, Fang Zhichao, Yu Zheng, Liu Chucai, Gan Jiaxiang, and twelve others recently proposed that the government be requested to negotiate with friendly countries as soon as possible to strictly investigate funds fleeing abroad so that citizens can fulfill their tax obligations. The opinion of the Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee on the case is to transfer it to the Foreign Affairs Committee to jointly review it with the Finance and Economics Committee.

### Whether Legislators' Proposal to Promulgate Amnesty Can Be Submitted Is Not Clearly Defined; Procedure Committee Lists the Case as a Reporting Matter

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] Legislators Duanmu Jie and 31 others recently proposed that the government be requested to promulgate an amnesty. However, the opinion of the Procedure Committee of the Yuan is that "According to Article 58 of the Constitution, amnesty cases are proposed by the Executive Yuan after deliberation. Article 63 stipulates that the Legislative Yuan has the power to decide on amnesty. Furthermore, Article 15 of the Legislative Yuan's Organizational Law only stipulates the submission of legislative proposals by legislators. As for whether amnesty cases can be submitted, there are no explicit provisions, which seems to await interpretation by the Judicial Yuan." Therefore, the case has been listed as a reporting matter and will be presented at the meeting on the 13th. The proposed measures in the case include: (1) The target of the amnesty is limited to those who committed crimes before the President's inauguration on May 20 of this year. (2) Those whose most severe sentence is imprisonment of a fixed term or less shall be granted amnesty. Those whose most severe sentence is death or life imprisonment shall have their sentences reduced by one-half (reporter's note: the original case is like this, but how to calculate it is really a question). (3) War criminals, traitors, corrupt officials, those who murdered their parents, and drug offenders shall not be granted amnesty or reduction. However, as the question of whether the Legislative Yuan can submit an amnesty case has already raised the question of legal interpretation, this matter is unlikely to be resolved in the short term.

### Control Yuan Holds General Meeting This Morning to Discuss Resumption of Meetings and Exercise of Consent Rights; President Hosts All Control Yuan Members This Afternoon

[Our Nanjing Office, 11th Dispatch] The Control Yuan held a meeting of all members at 9:00 a.m. on the 11th, convened by President Yu. In addition to President Yu's report on the results of the meeting convened by the President on the 10th to discuss the issue of the Control Yuan's proposal of laws, after discussion by all members, it was decided that a general meeting would be held at 9:00 a.m. on the 12th to discuss the resumption of meetings and the exercise of consent rights. The adjournment of the Control Yuan ended on the 10th. At the meeting on the morning of the 11th, Secretary-General Li Chongshi reported that the list of grand justices and examination members nominated by the President had been sent for a long time and urgently needed the Yuan's consent. Secondly, the President had scheduled a tea party at the Presidential Residence from 5:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. on the 12th to entertain all members of the Control Yuan. After Mr. Li's report, President Yu reported on the process and results of the meeting at the Presidential Palace on the 10th and reported on the opinions of the Control Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Secretariat of the Presidential Palace. Then, the members spoke. Liang Shangdong believed that if we immediately resume the meeting, exercise the right of consent, and produce grand justices, the responsibility of the grand justices lies in interpreting the Constitution. However, the Control Yuan's proposal of laws is not found in the scope of the law, and the grand justices may have no basis for interpretation. Therefore, the emergence of grand justices will not help matters. However, Mr. Liang stated that he was not opposed to the resumption of meetings. Many people then spoke. Hu Wenhui and others believed that if the recess lasted for a long time, human and material resources would be insufficient, and the outside world would not understand the Yuan. Because we have very high salaries and enjoy good benefits, the daily cost of automobiles is over 10 million yuan, and each meeting day increases the government's burden. Therefore, it was proposed that the meeting be resumed immediately. De Xuan also said: In the midst of the intense war in the Central Plains and soaring prices, the Yuan should resume the meeting first. At the same time, he proposed that all members of the Yuan donate one or three days' income to comfort the soldiers at the front. However, at the same time, some people believed that after the adjournment of the Yuan, a resolution to resume the meeting could not be made at the talk meeting, and an extraordinary meeting could not be held during the adjournment. However, because the majority advocated resumption of the meeting, a final decision was reached at 11:30 a.m. The discussion will take place at the general meeting on the morning of the 12th. (The opinions of the Judicial and Control Yuans on the issue of proposing laws are published on page 2)

### Legislators from Northeast Issue Statement

Expressing Attitude Towards July 5th Incident

[Our Beiping Office, 11th Dispatch] Legislators Zhao Shixi, Liu Bokun, Liu Shengban, Li Jiwu, Zhou Muwen, and Bao Yimin, who are from the Northeast and are residing in Beiping, issued a statement on the 10th regarding the "July 5th" incident, stating: (1) The Security Bureau should face the consequences of the "July 5th" incident squarely and should not hesitate to push the student movement as the essence of the enemy. Since the authorities cannot prove that the dead and injured were all communists, they must take the blame and be sincere in holding those involved accountable for manslaughter. Glossing over and whitewashing will only increase the complexity of the situation's development. (2) The goals of the "July 5th" movement were originally very simple, but the resulting tragedy and the blood of our youth are exactly the temperature that the Communist Party can exploit. It is hoped that the youth of the same hometown will take strict steps. (3) The incident was caused by the resolution of the Beiping City Council. It is hoped that the City Council will remain silent. The undersigned absolutely disagree with the City Council's statement on the 10th. Strictly speaking, Beiping City is the Beiping of the whole country, and it has never been heard that anyone has emphasized the regionality of Beiping City.

Director of Beiping Education Bureau Advocates Sanctioning Those Who Fired the First Shot

[Our Beiping Office, 11th Dispatch] Wang Jigao, Director of the Beiping Education Bureau, explained the process of handling relief for students from the Northeast at a press conference, saying: He firmly believes that the people of North China have absolutely no psychological discrimination against the people of the Northeast as accused by the outside world. The occurrence of the unfortunate "July 5th" incident was due to insufficient coordination among all parties beforehand. Mr. Wang said: "My position is not high, and it doesn't matter whether I do it or not. I don't have to lie. To be honest, the final unfortunate incident was unexpected. The person who fired the first shot should be sanctioned by law."

Editorial

### Pay Attention to British Construction of the India-Tibet Highway!

As China is being exhausted, its national defense and border security are also under threat. Geographically, the Northeast has changed color, the new districts are unstable, the Yunnan-Burma and Yunnan-Vietnam borders are disputed, and alarming news has come from Tibet and Xikang. According to recent reports, Britain is actively constructing a highway on our Kang border, directly connecting to the Indian province of Assam, a place called Guidi. Our central and local authorities are closely monitoring the construction and are engaging in negotiations with British India. The Indian Ambassador to China has stated that there is no such thing, but the truth remains to be concretely proven. This matter greatly concerns our western border defense. If it is true, we should lodge a strong protest with British India and take effective measures through diplomatic and domestic channels to stop Britain's illegal road construction across the border.

Xikang is our western border region, and its position is important. Thousands of years of history have shown that turmoil in Kang and Tibet not only affects the safety of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Qinghai provinces, but also influences historical changes. In the past, to govern the borders, it was necessary to secure and stabilize Kang and Tibet. Due to the inappropriate border policies of the Manchu Qing dynasty and the westward encroachment of British imperial power, the Tibet issue became increasingly complex and serious, almost being swept away by the British Empire. The 12th Dalai Lama's forty-year rule in Tibet was consistently pro-British and anti-Han. If it were not for the success of the National Revolution and the central government's enlightened tolerance towards Tibet, Tibet would have likely already gone down the path of independence. When the Dalai Lama passed away in the 22nd year of the Republic, the Regent Reting Rinpoche, one of the four great Hutuktu, took over the regency, and the situation in Tibet rapidly improved. Reting reversed the Dalai Lama's actions, enthusiastically supporting the central government's war of resistance and reducing the troops threatening the Kang border. The Tibetan people loved Reting and supported his inward-looking policies, but unfortunately, the government was too busy to assist in the west, missing the opportunity to properly resolve the Tibet issue. In the 31st year of the Republic, Reting retired, handing over the regency to his teacher, Taktra, agreeing to hand over political power in two years. Last year, Reting was murdered, and 5,000 lamas from the Sera Monastery, one of the three major monasteries, were annihilated by Taktra. After this major political and religious change, Tibetan politics was completely controlled by the pro-British faction, reversing Reting's actions and even attempting to establish "diplomatic" relations with Britain, Japan, and the United States in an independent capacity. This can be seen in the independent activities of the Tibetan delegation at the Pan-Asian Conference held in India last year, and the recent visit of the Tibetan trade delegation to the United States.

The British construction of the Kang-Tibet highway is not a recent event, but began after the Tibetan coup last year. It is regrettable that the diplomatic and domestic authorities did not pay attention and take effective steps to stop its development, leading to the increasingly serious situation today. On August 27th of last year, this newspaper's Chongqing dispatch stated: Regarding the British construction of highways in Metok, Zayu, Bomi, and other places on the Kang-Tibet border, the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters had ordered the Kang and Yunnan provinces to pay close attention and collect evidence for strong negotiations. The Yunnan Provincial Government further ordered the special commissioners of the area to instruct the neighboring Detchen, Huangshan, Fugong, Bijiang, and Lushui administrative bureaus to conduct thorough investigations and reports. It has recently been confirmed that the highway starting from Sadiya has not yet reached Zayu. Recently, it has continued northward from Walong, about a hundred li southwest of Zayu, and is expected to be completed by the end of the 37th year of the Republic. The British and Tibetans have an agreement that allows merchants to transport firearms and daily necessities from Sadiya every year. After this project is completed to Zayu, it will extend northward from Sang'ang (Liao Mai) in the northeast to Wesidu (Bing Mu Duo), and another branch via Bomi and Tai Zhao can reach Arandhamy, connecting to India. At the India-Tibet border, British Indian military officers are stationed, and large stones are erected, engraved with British, Chinese, Indian, and other characters. The Chinese characters read, "Isn't it a pleasure to have friends coming from afar?" Also, according to news in May of this year, the India-Tibet highway has been built to Gexibu. If there are no obstacles, it can be built to Sikang by the end of this year.

Based on continuous reports over the past year and official reports, the British construction of the India-Tibet highway seems to be not only a verified fact, but also an attempt of great significance. This foreign force's penetration into Kang and Tibet, connecting the transportation routes of the high mountains and ridges of India, Kang, and Tibet, cannot be explained by the reason of facilitating trade. The threat to the security of Sichuan, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Kang is unimaginable. We should lodge a strong protest with British India and effectively prevent the construction of the India-Tibet highway.

Tibet is a local region of our country. The British signing a road construction contract with our local autonomous government is an act against public law and harmful to our national sovereignty. This measure is detrimental to the relationship between China and Britain in terms of both treaties and the development of friendly relations. We protest against Britain's measures that harm our territorial sovereignty and hope that the enlightened British government will stop these unfriendly actions to avoid escalating disputes.

Finally, we want to call the attention of the central government: In order to ensure national defense and border stability, we should adopt an active border policy to prevent foreign factors and seek self-preservation; implement thorough domestic reforms to promote the political and economic progress of the border regions, leading to social customs, ethnic cultures, and exchanges to the greatest extent possible, gradually moving towards the great goal of the Chinese family. Only with this kind of effort can we ensure the borders and prevent division!

### Establishment of the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Committee: President Chiang Sends Special Telegram of Encouragement, Hoping for United Effort to Serve the Country

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] President Chiang sent a telegram on the 11th to the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Mobilization Committee. The original telegram reads as follows: Chairman Sun of the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Mobilization Committee and all committee members: Since our country returned from the victory of the War of Resistance, we could have strengthened ourselves in a timely manner, engaged in reproduction and education, and gradually promoted various construction projects, becoming prosperous and sharing benefits. However, due to the Communist Party's rebellion and wanton destruction, the areas affected by the adverse atmosphere have been devastated, and the people have been poisoned, resulting in the sudden suppression of national construction work. In order to lay the foundation for social stability and relieve the suffering of the people, the government has had to engage in suppression and quickly seek to eliminate the rebellion. However, military operations still depend on the mutual use of politics. Therefore, we have especially invited talents from all over the country to form the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Mobilization Committee to concentrate will and work together. Now, at the time of its organization and establishment, it is also the time of active progress in the suppression of rebellion. Each committee member has either a reputation in the local area or has contributed to the country. It is hoped that everyone will work together, continue to serve the country, and, regarding the matters that should be promoted for the suppression of rebellion and national reconstruction, promptly start work in their original place of origin or place of employment, assist the local government in promoting everything, and arouse the local people to exert mass power, so that suppressing the rebellion is the foundation for building the country, and construction is the way to suppress the rebellion. In short, we hope that politics and military, the people and the government, will go to the same goal, achieve success together, and the future of the country truly relies on it. Chiang Kai-shek.

### Sun Ke Holds Tea Party to Greet Committee Members

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Sun Ke, Chairman of the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Mobilization Committee, held a tea party at the National Assembly Hall at 4:00 PM on the 11th to greet the appointed members of the committee. After Sun Ke explained the organization and scope of business of the committee (speech to follow), Gu Zhenggang of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Peng Zhaoxian, Minister of Interior, Jiang Yuntian, representative of the Democratic Socialist Party, and others delivered speeches. Minister Gu stated: The Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Committee is composed of talents from all over the country. Today, the bandit rebellion is serious, and it is still not enough for the whole country to work hard to suppress the rebellion. Now that the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Mobilization Committee has been established, it should lead the people of the whole country, following the eight slogans of the War of Resistance period - national supremacy, ethnic supremacy, victory first, military first, concentration of will, concentration of power, contributing money if you have money, contributing effort if you have effort - to work hard for suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion. Minister Peng, in his speech, particularly emphasized that if we want to win the suppression of bandits and quelling the rebellion today, we must make the best use of people's talents and the best use of the land's resources. Organizing and training the people is a matter of urgency. Each member of the Suppression of Rebellion and National Reconstruction Committee should put more effort into this when returning to their hometowns in the future. Jiang Yuntian, in his speech, said that those in charge should have power if they can exert strength in everything. When the Suppression of Rebellion Committee makes efforts in suppressing the rebellion and national reconstruction, the government should give it full power. Finally, all the attending committee members unanimously passed a resolution to (1) send a telegram to President Chiang to express respect, (2) send a telegram to the officers and soldiers in eastern Henan to express respect, and (3) send a telegram to the soldiers and civilians of the whole country to work together and strengthen the work of suppressing the rebellion.

### False Alarm at the National Assembly Hall: Short Circuit in Fluorescent Light Wires Causes Fire; Fortunately, Immediate Rescue Prevents Major Disaster

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 11th] A fire broke out at the National Assembly Hall on the morning of the 11th. Fortunately, the on-duty staff and military police made every effort to rescue the situation, preventing a major disaster. The fire broke out in the new building on the right side of the assembly hall, which was formerly the registration area for National Assembly representatives and legislators and is now the office of the Legislative Yuan and a rest area for committee members. The cause of the fire was that the tape on the fluorescent light wires on the ceiling had been burned out due to prolonged use, causing a short circuit and igniting the wires. The entire structure of the new building is mostly made of wood and cardboard, originally intended only for temporary use. However, because the assembly hall itself was short of space, it was not demolished. At around 4:00 AM, the staff living in the Overseas Chinese Reception Center in the rest area were awakened from their sleep. They realized that the fire in the center of the ceiling was turning into a major conflagration.

### Farmland in the Lakeside Area of Hunan Destroyed by Floods: Increased Cotton and Rice Production Ends in Failure; If River Water Continues to Rise, the Prospects for the Autumn Harvest are Worrisome

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 11th] The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry originally designated Hunan Province as a food production area and had prepared detailed plans, which have been implemented. It is now learned that the Hunan Provincial Food Production Committee's plan to increase cotton and rice production in the lakeside counties has failed because the sown cotton fields have been completely destroyed by the flood. According to people familiar with the agricultural situation, the prospects for a bumper harvest of grain in the lakeside area are hopeless.

### Rice Purchase Disputes Outside Changmen, Suzhou

Proper Prevention Prevents Unrest

Fortunately, the police station's proper prevention prevented unrest.

[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 11th] Prices in Zhenjiang today are still chaotic. High-quality white rice is approaching the 30 million yuan mark, and imported sundries continue to rise.

### Martial Law in Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province: Bandit Attack on Central and Bank of China Repelled; Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters Decides to Strengthen Pacification Forces in the Southern Route

[Our Correspondent, Guangzhou, 11th] It is learned that at 3:00 AM on the 10th, hundreds of bandits infiltrated Zhanjiang City from the Jiayamu, Linggang, Xiyingqiao, and Cunjinqiao roads, looting the Central Bank and the Bank of China and attacking the military and police organs. After the military police teams fought fiercely for more than five hours, all the bandits were finally defeated, and the remnants fled towards Suixi. The bandits used the name "Second Detachment of the Guangdong-Guangxi Border Area People's Liberation Army," led by bandit leaders Wen Zhuohua, Zhang Qiang, and Lu Jing. It is judged that the bandit action was of a looting and disruptive nature because they only attacked the Chikan commercial district and did not dare to directly attack the Xiying district, the administrative center. It is rumored that the Central Bank lost 30-40 billion yuan, but the bank claimed that there were no significant losses. Qiang Fusen, the director of a certain central agency stationed in Zhanjiang, and his servant were killed in the melee. Zhang Ruigui, the commander-in-chief of the Guangdong-Guangxi Southern District, and Mayor Zhang Zhongjiang immediately held an emergency meeting at noon to determine a plan to defend the city and pursue the bandits and announced martial law that evening. Currently, telegraph and telephone communications between Guangzhou and Zhanjiang are still normal. Also, the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters has now decided to increase the tenth administrative district to strengthen the pacification forces in the Zhanjiang area of the southern route and will appoint Zhang Junsong as the commander.

### Luo Qinghua Discusses Property Tax

[Nanjing News] Legislator Luo Qinghua told reporters: The provisional property tax draft is intended to "find the person through the property." The capital of wealthy families has long been evaded overseas. The initial special relief donation was intended to "find money through the person," that is, "ordering the wealthy families to donate." However, Mr. Liu Butong, who is now supervising the special relief donation, says, "The wealth of the rich is either invested in profit-making businesses or used to purchase land." In this case, the wealth of wealthy families has not been evaded. Mr. Liu's past calls from the Political Council to the Legislative Yuan to "confiscate the deposits of Chinese citizens in the United States" have all become empty talk. It is remembered that at the beginning of the victory, the machine industry in the Great Rear Area had voluntarily and collectively donated factory property, requesting the government to take over all technicians. Currently, more than a thousand machine factories in Shanghai are also on the verge of being unable to maintain their operations. The machine industry is the mother of industry, and its decline to this point is imaginable. The best estimate for the current agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors is "having property but no wealth." If property is the primary target of the tax, the result will be nothing more than "increased harassment and no benefit to the national treasury." We must thoroughly ensure that those who truly have money contribute, and that the president has the power to enact laws and raise funds for suppressing the rebellion, allocating public bonds for suppressing the rebellion to the wealthy. As long as the government is determined, the number of wealthy families can be counted on one's fingers, and there is no need to harm the innocent, causing national unrest. The name of property tax, although still novel and pleasing to the ear in our country and can stimulate people's hearts, still requires careful consideration of the advantages and disadvantages and should not be tried lightly. It is expected that this case will be properly resolved in the Legislative Yuan.

### Proposing Legal Bills: Both the Judicial and Supervisory Yuans Should Have the Right; the Constitutional Omission Should be Resolved Through Consultation, the Judicial Yuan Argues

Judicial Yuan's Opinion

[Our newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] Regarding the issue of whether the Supervisory Yuan can submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan has presented its opinion to the Presidential Office for joint consultation. President Yu also reported it at the Tanpin (Discussion) Meeting held on the 1st. Su Huiwen (reporter) reports as follows:

Regarding the different texts of the Sixth Army, a situation report has occurred. If the text stipulates that two things have occurred, according to the practices of various countries, they should be resolved by the agencies with the authority to interpret laws, and the resolution should be regarded as a final decision until the constitution is amended.

The difference in opinions between the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan this time is because the constitution does not explicitly stipulate that the Supervisory Yuan can submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan (regarding the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan, there are provisions in Articles 58 and 87). This type of problem originally belongs to the interpretation of the constitution, but our country's constitution has another provision in Article 44 for disputes between Yuans, as follows:

For disputes between Yuans, unless otherwise provided by the constitution, the President may convene the heads of the relevant Yuans for consultation and resolution. The above article refers to consultation rather than meetings, and it actually has the meaning of mediation. It is to communicate the different opinions between the Yuans and bring them into agreement. However, the method of its resolution is not to force the minority to obey the majority (refer to the explanation of Article 45 in the draft of the Constitution of the Republic of China). During consultation, if the opinions of both parties are consistent, the relevant Yuans will convene meetings (the Judicial Yuan does not have a Yuan meeting but a Grand Justices Meeting) to make a resolution, which will serve as the basis for implementation. If the opinions of both parties cannot be reconciled, it will be necessary to interpret the constitution to make a decision.

As for the question of whether the President can submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan on matters within his authority, it seems appropriate to study it at the same time so that there is a basis for application when needed.

Furthermore, Article 69 of the Fifth Five-Year Constitution Draft clearly stipulates: "The Executive, Judicial, Examination, and Supervisory Yuans may submit proposals to the Legislative Yuan regarding matters under their jurisdiction." The explanation of this article believes that "in countries with the separation of powers, if the government cannot submit proposals to the meeting, there will often be problems of incompatibility. In the Five-Power Constitution, although the five Yuans independently exercise their powers, there are still many connections between them. Moreover, the Executive, Judicial, Examination, and Supervisory Yuans know the matters under their jurisdiction most thoroughly and should be allowed to submit proposals to the Legislative Yuan." The reasoning is very correct. The coordination meeting advocated the Wang Cabinet system, so at first, the power to submit proposals was exclusively given to the Executive Yuan. Later, because the responsible cabinet system was adopted, and at that time, some people argued that the Examination Yuan might have the right to submit laws to the Legislative Yuan on all matters, the final draft specifically confined this power to the Examination Yuan. Article 92 of the draft submitted to the Constitutional National Assembly stated: "When the Examination Yuan submits a legal bill regarding matters under its jurisdiction, the Secretary-General of the Examination Yuan shall attend the Legislative Yuan to explain it." After review and amendment by the First Review Committee, it became: "The Examination Yuan may submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan regarding matters under its jurisdiction." That is, Article 87 of the Constitution. The situation of the drafting was roughly like this. In addition to the Executive Yuan, only the Examination Yuan is allowed to submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan, while the Judicial and Supervisory Yuans are both empty-handed. This is indeed an omission during drafting and should be resolved through consultation as soon as possible.

In short, although there is no explicit provision in the constitution, both the Judicial and Supervisory Yuans should have the same right to submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan in terms of both reason and sentiment, and this limit is only applied to the matters under their jurisdiction. The final decision rests with the Legislative Yuan, which does not hinder the exercise of legislative power.

Supervisory Yuan's Opinion

[Our newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 11th] The Supervisory Yuan's opinion on the issue of submitting legal bills to the Legislative Yuan, presented at the meeting convened by the President with the heads of the relevant Yuans, is as follows:

The facts and reasons for the Supervisory Yuan's submission of legal bills to the Legislative Yuan are now described separately below:

(1) Factual Background:

(1) In order to exercise the powers conferred by the Constitution, the Supervisory Yuan drafted a draft of the Supervisory Law, which was approved at the 5th meeting held on June 19, and resolved to "request the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures as soon as possible," and sent the draft to the Legislative Yuan for review on the 21st. It also drafted the draft of the Organizational Regulations of the Committees of the Supervisory Yuan, which was approved at the 7th, 8th, and 9th meetings held on June 22, 23, and 24, and resolved to "request the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures as soon as possible," and sent the draft to the Legislative Yuan on the 24th.

(2) On June 26, the Legislative Yuan's Legal System Committee sent a letter stating that it would review the draft of the Supervisory Law at 3:00 PM on June 28, and requesting personnel to attend and explain. At the 12th meeting held on June 28, the Yuan publicly appointed three members, Tian Tongjin, Fen Honglie, and Chen Qinghua, to participate. Subsequently, on the 29th, at the 13th meeting, Committee Member Tian Tongjin reported that the Legislative Yuan could not accept the legal bills submitted by the Yuan because there was no explicit provision in the law.

(3) At the 14th meeting on June 30, Committee Members Chen Daji, Honglie, and Li Zhengle proposed the question of the Supervisory Yuan submitting legal bills. After discussion, it was decided to form a Research Committee on the Issue of the Supervisory Yuan Submitting Legal Bills, consisting of 22 Committee Members, including Tian Tongjin, to discuss concrete measures and submit them to the meeting. At the 16th meeting on July 2, the Committee submitted a report, and it was resolved to request the President to convene a meeting with the heads of the relevant Yuans (the President of the Supervisory Yuan, the President of the Legislative Yuan, and the President of the Judicial Yuan) to resolve the issue of the Supervisory Yuan submitting legal bills in accordance with the provisions of Article 44 of the Constitution.

(4) In accordance with the above resolution, the Yuan sent a letter to the President on July 3 for consultation.

(5) On July 3, the Yuan received Consultation No. 584 from the Legislative Yuan's Constitutional Yuan, stating that the submitted Supervisory Law military bill had been submitted to the Legal System Committee for review and report. According to the new law, the Supervisory Yuan's submission of legal bills to the Yuan did not seem to be based on any provision, and it was inconvenient to review. It was then submitted to the 16th meeting of the Yuan (Legislative Yuan), and it was resolved to follow the review opinions and it was inconvenient to review the case. At the same time, the case had been submitted by Yuan Member Mao Yihu and others as a separate case and was resolved to be handed over to the Legal System Committee for review and recorded on file. Furthermore, the draft of the Organizational Regulations of the Committees of the Supervisory Yuan, which had been submitted, was decided at the 16th meeting of the Yuan (Legislative Yuan): "The case was submitted by the Supervisory Yuan" without any basis, and was changed to be submitted by a member of the Legal System Committee of the Yuan (Legislative Yuan), and the original consultation was returned," and the record was made on file, etc., and the original two consultations were attached and returned to the Yuan.

(2) Reasons Why the Supervisory Yuan Can Submit Legal Bills:

(1) Article 58, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution stipulates: "The President of the Executive Yuan and the heads of the ministries and commissions shall submit the legal bills, budget bills, martial law bills, amnesty bills, declarations of war, treaties of peace, treaty bills, and other important matters, or matters involving the common relations of the ministries and commissions, to the Executive Yuan for discussion and decision." A careful examination of the meaning of the original text does not stipulate that the Executive Yuan can submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan, but rather points out that the above-mentioned cases should be discussed and decided by the Executive Yuan, which is a necessary procedure for proposals. In addition, there is no basis for reference in the Constitution regarding the proposal issues of the Yuan.

(2) Furthermore, Article 71 of the Constitution stipulates: "When the Legislative Yuan is in session, the heads of the relevant Yuans and the heads of the ministries and commissions may attend and express their opinions." The words "heads of the relevant Yuans" in the article were originally "President of the Executive Yuan" in the draft at the time of constitution-making. At the second reading meeting, 34 representatives, including Shi Shangkuan, submitted an amendment in accordance with Article 24 of the Rules of Procedure, changing "President of the Executive Yuan" to "heads of the relevant Yuans." The reason was: "The heads of the Examination Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, and the Supervisory Yuan may attend the Legislative Yuan and express their opinions on legal bills under their jurisdiction."

This amendment was submitted to the 15th meeting of the National Assembly for discussion. Of the 1,400 representatives present, 947 voted in favor, indicating that when Article 71 was formulated at that time, the change from President of the Executive Yuan to heads of the relevant Yuans had already recognized that the Supervisory Yuan could submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan.

Article 87 of the Constitution has the provision "The Examination Yuan may submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan regarding matters under its jurisdiction," which has led to the Legislative Yuan's doubts about the Supervisory Yuan's proposals. However, the original text of the draft at the time of constitution-making stated, "When the Examination Yuan submits a legal bill regarding matters under its jurisdiction, the Secretary-General of the Examination Yuan shall attend the Legislative Yuan to explain it," and it seemed to only stipulate that the Secretary-General should attend the explanation. Later, due to a proposal by Shi Shangkuan and others, it was deemed unnecessary to stipulate that the Secretary-General should attend, and the article was amended. Therefore, the initial formulation of this article did not solely point out that the Examination Yuan could make proposals, while other Yuans were restricted.

According to the legislative practice of various countries in the world, if it is not stipulated by the constitution and is not prohibited, the legislative body can formulate a law to remedy the omissions in the constitution. The Provisional Constitution during the Political Tutelage period in our country did not stipulate the issue of various agencies submitting proposals to the Legislative Yuan. However, it was clearly stipulated in the Organizational Law of the National Government, indicating that the right to propose to the Legislative Yuan does not necessarily have to be stipulated in the constitution, and the constitution does not have a negative restriction prohibiting the Supervisory Yuan from proposing. It is possible to adopt the common practices of various countries and formulate another law, allowing the Supervisory Yuan to submit legal bills to the Legislative Yuan regarding matters under its jurisdiction.

### U.S. Democratic National Convention to Open This Afternoon in Philadelphia; Participating Delegates Include Those from Forty-Eight States; With Eisenhower Refusing Nomination, Truman's Election Can be Assured

[United Press Washington Dispatch, 10th] The Democratic National Convention will open in Philadelphia at 11:30 AM on the 12th. The main tasks of the convention will be to nominate presidential and vice-presidential candidates, pass the party platform, and take necessary measures related to the happiness of the entire party. The Democratic National Committee headquarters here stated that although there will be 1,596 delegates and the same number of alternate delegates attending the convention, the actual number of votes for electing the presidential and vice-presidential candidates is 1,234, and the necessary majority to secure the nomination will be 618 votes. The delegates attending the convention include delegations from forty-eight states. The delegates from Alaska and Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, the Panama Canal Zone, and the Virgin Islands do not possess a majority of votes. Delegations with the most votes include: New York State with 98 votes, Pennsylvania with 74 votes, Illinois with 60 votes, Ohio with 50 votes, California with 54 votes, Texas with 50 votes, and Michigan with 42 votes. The voting strength of delegations from areas other than states is: Alaska with 6 votes, Hawaii with 6 votes, the District of Columbia with 6 votes, Puerto Rico with 6 votes, the Panama Canal Zone with 2 votes, and the Virgin Islands with 2 votes.

[Reuters Washington Dispatch, 11th] The 1,500 delegates of the Democratic Party are scheduled to meet in Philadelphia on Monday to select the Democratic candidate for the presidential election in November. Although Truman is widely dissatisfied with the party, since the major factions in the party cannot agree on the nomination of other candidates, Truman's election as the presidential candidate can be regarded as a foregone conclusion. The Democratic Party, which has been in power for sixteen years, has seen its internal opinions on domestic and foreign affairs split. Many party members admit that the political empire established by Roosevelt has been broken. The only person who can unite the party members is General Eisenhower, but Ike has repeatedly and firmly stated that he will not agree to be nominated as a presidential candidate. On the eve of the Democratic Party's National Convention, although it is preparing to nominate Truman as the presidential candidate, its lack of enthusiasm is rare in the history of the US presidential election. The strategists of the Democratic presidential campaign plan to focus on the party's domestic policies and policies to eliminate racial discrimination. However, regarding the latter, the Democratic members of the southern states firmly oppose the improvement of black people's treatment. Most of the southern voters are staunch supporters of the Democratic Party. Black people are only allowed to vote in certain areas of the country. The Democratic Party in the northern states relies heavily on black votes, especially in the states of Illinois, Pennsylvania, and New York. Truman's submission to Congress of a bill to protect the human rights of black people is to win the votes of the Democratic Party in the northern states. However, the Southern Democrats have stated that if the Democratic Party's presidential campaign uses the issue of black people's treatment as a wager, the Southern Democrats will not hesitate to withdraw from the National Convention. In addition, the secession of leftists from the Democratic Party under the leadership of Wallace has also greatly weakened the party's strength. According to a survey, 286 of the Democratic National Convention delegates have stated that they will support Truman, and they also said that they can obtain the support of another 354 delegates. It is not difficult for them to obtain 618 votes, which is more than half of the votes, and be nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate.

### U.S. Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate; All Eyes on Barkley; Douglas Declares Resolute Refusal of Nomination

[United Press Philadelphia Dispatch, 10th] According to the situation on the 10th, the Democratic National Convention may nominate Barkley as the vice-presidential candidate. Most people in the party have also turned to support Senate Democratic Leader Barkley as the vice-presidential candidate. The secretary of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee has predicted that Barkley will be nominated by the convention.

Barkley has long enjoyed a reputation in the South and border states. Although the New Deal faction supports Supreme Court Justice Douglas as the vice-presidential candidate (if the presidential candidate nomination fails), Douglas himself has declared that he will refuse to participate in any nomination. Some veterans from industrial states believe that Barkley and Douglas are suitable candidates. As for Truman's attitude, although it has not been announced, it is expected that he will accept it, because the human rights bill still makes the party uneasy. Many people believe that Barkley's candidacy may bring back Southern Democratic members.

### Anti-Truman Delegates to Nominate Fiber

Mr. Fei is a Liberal Progressive

[United Press Philadelphia Dispatch, 10th] Anti-Truman delegates met on the 10th to discuss a plan to nominate a certain "liberal" as a presidential candidate at the Democratic Convention to "prevent an uncontested nomination" of Truman. This "liberal" may be Senator Lieber. The anti-Truman group includes the Political Action Committee of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the American People's Democratic Action Association, and other factions. The Democratic Party Chairman of Nebraska, Li Yingyi, was nominated as its leader. He told reporters that 40 to 50 delegates from 20 states gathered to discuss the name of a "recognized liberal progressive democratic leader" to be released on the evening of the 10th. It is likely to be Zuber, who also attended the meeting and stated that if his campaign is urged by "liberals," he will accept the nomination.

### Clap Attends Greek Military Meeting

Hill to Provide More Assistance

[Reuters Athens Dispatch, 10th] US Army Commander Kuraap, Minister of Strategic Affairs General Demai, attended a military meeting convened by Greek Prime Minister Sophoulis today. After the meeting, a press release was issued stating that Prime Minister Sophoulis had submitted a memorandum to Kuraap, detailing Greece's military needs, and requested the United States to provide more firearms needed by the army to quell the rebellion and stop the abnormal situation in Greece. Other participants included US Military Chief Fleet, British Military Chief Tang En, Greek Chief of Staff Yang Tais, and Greek Foreign Minister Tsairdaliris.

### Montgomery Returns to England from Paris

[Reuters Paris Dispatch, 11th] British Imperial Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery, who had stayed here for several days and met with French military leaders, set off for England today.

### International Labor Conference Opens; to Form Asian Labor Association

[United Press San Francisco Dispatch, 10th] The International Labor Conference closed on the 10th. Chairman, representative of France, Kota, read out a telegram from MacArthur, accepting the invitation of the International Labor Organization to send a three-person observation group from Japan to attend the next conference.

[Reuters San Francisco Dispatch, 11th] The General Committee of the Asian Labor Association announced that the Association has authorized Ali, the Indian labor representative attending the International Labor Organization, to contact trade unions in China, Japan, Vietnam, Siam, Malaysia, Ceylon, and other places to explain the goals of the Asian Labor Association. Ali will soon travel to the above countries.

### British Cabinet Members Discuss Berlin Situation

[Reuters London Dispatch, 10th] Minister of State and Deputy Foreign Secretary McNiel delivered a speech at the United Nations Association banquet in Langford today, solemnly stating that the Berlin incident is by no means an isolated incident, but a focal point of various disputes. The UK's handling of the Berlin incident will be based on its consistent principle, that is, each has the ambition to cooperate, and the UK turns to be the first to engage in cooperation, but concession is not a substitute for cooperation, so the UK will never engage in progress.

On the same day, several other cabinet members also publicly talked about the Berlin question. Air Force Minister Huntenson, who will fly to Berlin on Sunday to observe the airlift situation, also delivered a speech in Winsford, Staffordshire, stating that it is terrible that the human rights and needs of millions of people are mortgaged due to differences between one country and another. If the Soviet leaders can lift the blockade and resolve the Ke controversy at the conference table, would it not be a great practical animal with a very valuable signal? Minister of Defence Alexander delivered a speech at Kirkpe, Nottingham, hoping that everyone could recognize the danger of the Berlin situation, and that permanent peace would be impossible to establish until the principles of justice and freedom were established. Deputy Foreign Secretary Mai Xiu delivered a speech in Noviquan, saying that the Soviet Union wanted to drive the Western powers out of Berlin, while the people of Berlin eagerly hoped that the Western allies would stay in Berlin, fearing that after the Western powers withdrew from Berlin, they would face the same fate as other anti-communist elements in communist-controlled countries.

### Door to Negotiations on Berlin Issue Not Closed; Three Powers Quietly Await Soviet Reply; British and Soviet Commanders in Germany Return Home to Request Instructions

[Reuters Berlin Dispatch, 10th] It is reported that British and Soviet military leaders in Germany have both been recalled to their countries to receive instructions regarding the Berlin crisis. British authorities announced that British Army Commander Bosen will fly to London on Monday to discuss the serious international situation caused by the blockade with the Foreign Office. According to confirmed information, Soviet Army Commander Sokolovsky returned to Moscow on Thursday to hold similar emergency talks with the government.

Moscow has remained silent on the note of protest against the Berlin blockade submitted by Britain, the United States, and France. However, according to Russian sources in Berlin, the Soviet Union will reject the protests of the three powers in strong terms. The reply will be submitted to the ambassadors of the three powers to the Soviet Union before Marshal Sokolovsky returns to Berlin on Monday. According to the Berlin Evening Express, which reflects the official policy of the Soviet Union, the note from the three powers did not close the door to East-West treatment.

### Soviet Union's Nerve Warfare; Berlin Airlift Corridor; Practice Blind Flying

[Associated Press Berlin Dispatch, 11th] US Air Force authorities announced today that the Soviet Union seems to be planning to launch a small-scale nerve warfare campaign against the pilots of the US and Britain who are airlifting supplies to Berlin, because the Soviet Union has announced that Soviet aircraft will practice blind flying in the air corridor between Berlin and West Germany. However, if this happens, there is little chance of a collision with British and American aircraft, because Soviet pilots are certainly no more likely to commit suicide than British and American pilots.

[Reuters Berlin Dispatch, 11th] The Soviet authorities today separately notified the British and American authorities, accusing the British and American aircraft of transporting food and other supplies from West Germany to Berlin without Soviet permission, and without prior notification to the Berlin Air Safety Control Station, which had violated air transport safety rules. At the same time, the climate in Berlin has improved, and British and American aircraft continue to land in Berlin in large numbers. By 11:00 AM, 100 American aircraft had landed.

[United Press Berlin Dispatch, 10th] The United States today warned the Soviet Union that if the Soviet Union insists on implementing the planned "instrument flight" along the Western Allies' Berlin air corridor, Soviet aircraft will be responsible for the risk.

### North Korea's Regular General Election; Decided to Challenge the United Nations and the United States

[New Asia News Agency Seoul Dispatch, 11th] According to Pyongyang Broadcasting, the result of the 5th Joint Meeting of North and South Korean Political Parties was to pass the "Constitution of the Korean Democratic People's Republic" in North Korea alone. At the same time, in accordance with the Constitution, delegates to the Korean People's Congress were selected. It is reported that this election will be held on the 15th of this month.

[Central News Agency Seoul Dispatch, 10th United Press] Under the action of resisting the United Nations Korea plan, the North Korean communist puppet rulers announced that the North Korean election will be held on August 25. According to the Soviet-style constitution approved on May 1, the election announced by the North Korean People's Committee will adopt secret ballot. The elected parliament will then elect a 15-member presidium, which has the power to convene or declare a meeting closed, and enjoys privileges during the parliamentary recess. The constitution originally designated Seoul in the US-occupied area as the national capital, but the puppet government's statement stated that before the constitution can be implemented nationwide, its scope of exercise will be temporarily limited to North Korea. The Pyongyang Radio statement is a challenge to the United Nations and the United States, which are recently responsible for holding elections in South Korea.

### England and America Are Using Significant Pressure to Urge the Arab League to Extend the Truce; The Arab Side's Attitude Is Firm Against Any Sanctions

[Our Own Dispatch] New York, 11th—Holla Brod's spokesperson, Da, stated: "The Arabs will never yield to pressure." He indicated: "The greatest pressure is no more than death; we Arabs would rather die than abandon the struggle against the Jews." Before deciding to resume hostilities, the Arab League Political Committee resolved that any steps taken against the Arabs would not benefit them. The Arabs may also take retaliatory steps. Currently, the Arab side supplies oil to the Americans, but what the United States supplies to the Arabs are merely luxury goods. This official stated that if Britain were to implement economic sanctions against the Arabs, Britain's losses would certainly be greater than those of the Arabs.

[United Press International, Cairo, 10th] A meeting of Arab officials to discuss Britain's request to extend the Palestinian truce will not conclude until dawn on the 11th. After a two-hour discussion with British Ambassador Campbell, Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy stated, "The ambassador insisted that the truce period must be extended, but I expressed my personal views." After Campbell left, Nokrashy immediately consulted with Arab League Secretary-General Azzam Pasha. It is noted that Azzam Pasha had announced his rejection of UN mediator Count Bernadotte's proposal to extend the truce by ten days.

[Reuters, Damascus, 11th] It has been officially confirmed that the Syrian government has received a telegram from the British government urging Syria to accept Bernadotte's proposal to extend the truce by ten days. The Syrian cabinet held a meeting today to discuss the matter, and the Syrian Prime Minister received the Egyptian envoy to Syria to discuss the issue. Yesterday, a dispatch from Washington indicated that Britain and America were using significant pressure to persuade Arab countries to agree to a ten-day extension of the truce, warning that otherwise, the UN Security Council would have no alternative but to impose sanctions. Relevant sources believe that the Syrian government's response, to be presented to the British envoy tonight, will neither accept this proposal nor promise to change the Syrian government's policy.

[Reuters, Success, 10th] Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok today sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, stating that if the Arabs agree, the Jewish side is prepared to accept Bernadotte's recent proposal to extend the truce by ten days.

### Arabs and Jews Will Both Adopt Offensive Stances in Jerusalem

[United Press International, Cairo, 11th] A dispatch from Tel Aviv today reports that the Israeli Supreme Command has announced that the Jewish army has attacked and occupied positions near Lydda airport, and the Arab army has retreated from the fortified villages of Lydda and El-Ramle. Jewish forces are encircling and gradually shrinking the area between Lydda and El-Ramle, engaging in skirmishes with Arab forces in the suburbs of Lydda. According to a report from a United Press reporter in Tel Aviv, Jewish forces are expected to launch a frontal assault on Latrun. This location is situated on the highway connecting Jerusalem and the coastal city of Tel Aviv, and is the last major Arab stronghold outside of Jerusalem. Both the Jewish and Arab sides in Jerusalem are adopting offensive stances, with the Jewish forces planning to drive the Jordanian forces out of the Holy City.

### Soviet Union and Eastern European Satellite States Plan to Form a "Military Alliance"; Tito's Betrayal Thwarts Soviet Plans

[United Press International, London, 11th] East European diplomatic observers here claim that Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia's betrayal of the Cominform has prompted the Soviet Union to strengthen preparations for formally establishing a comprehensive "Eastern Bloc" to resist the "Western European Union." The method would be to merge the existing "Mutual Assistance Alliances" among Eastern European countries into a "Collective Defense" treaty against aggression from world capitalism. The meeting of Eastern European foreign ministers in Warsaw last month was the first step in the Soviet Union's preparations for establishing the "Eastern Alliance." It is estimated that the Eastern European foreign ministers will meet again soon to advance the "Eastern Alliance" plan.

Diplomatic circles also state that the foundation of the Soviet plan is a close military alliance, including automatic mutual assistance and close coordination of military forces, placing the armies of the signatory countries under Soviet command. Eastern European satellite states have a total of seventy divisions. Yugoslavia is the strongest, with approximately 500,000 soldiers. However, with Tito openly resisting the Cominform, the Soviet plan has not only been obstructed but also potentially overturned. Sources in Eastern Europe state that Tito's defection has made the Soviet Union even more eager to strengthen ties within its empire to prevent the formation of a separate Balkan alliance that would break away from Moscow. The Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellite states already have an intricate system of alliances and economic agreements. Except for Albania, it has mutual assistance agreements with all Eastern European countries, and most of these countries also have alliances with each other. The only deficiency is between Hungary and Romania. The main military and economic objectives of the "Eastern Alliance" are as follows: Militarily, to standardize the military equipment of countries within the Soviet sphere of influence, which the Soviet Union has already begun to do; Economically, to strengthen economic cooperation and encourage Soviet-style five-year plans. The Soviet Union already controls half of Eastern European trade.

### Douglas Flies to Berlin to Meet with Clay

[Central News Agency, London, 11th, United Press] US Ambassador to Britain Douglas has now flown to Berlin on a special plane belonging to the US military attache in Britain. Douglas will meet with US Military Governor Clay, and it is believed that they will discuss the general situation following the Berlin blockade.

### Thirteen Soviet Political Leaders Are More Brutal Than the Tsars; Churchill Emphasizes Not to Yield to the Soviets

[Reuters, Woodford, Essex County, 10th] Former wartime Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in his constituency today, harshly criticizing Soviet policy and strongly advising the government not to yield in the Berlin crisis. He said, "If we concede in this serious military issue, we will destroy the best chance to avoid a third world war. It must be understood that the Soviet Union is not a great power that can express its free will. The thirteen giants in the Kremlin have established themselves as masters of the brave Soviet people, ruling them with more autocratic and dictatorial means than any Tsar. No one knows what these thirteen giants in the Kremlin will do. They are not as reasonable as the Western world. Their primary interest lies in using wristbands to maintain their personal power over hundreds of millions of people of different races. The inside story of this oligarchy is unknown to the outside world. As far as I know, there are individual actions and even opposing actions within it. Otherwise, how can one explain that while the Berlin crisis is entering its climax, they still have the leisure to expel Yugoslavia from its group of vassal states?"

### Cominform Issues Statement Condemning Yugoslavia (Continued)

(Originally published in "The Christian Science Monitor," translated by the US News Service)

The Cominform firmly believes that the Yugoslav leadership has modified the Marxist-Leninist theory of the Party. According to Marxist-Leninist theory, the Party is the basic leading force of the nation, with its own distinct platform, and cannot be confused with the non-Party masses. The Party is the highest form of organization and the most important tool of the working class. However, Yugoslavia believes that the leading force is not the Communist Party but the People's Front. The Yugoslav leaders underestimate the tasks of the Communist Party and, in fact, allow it to dissolve into the People's Front. The People's Front includes various different classes: workers, farmers with private economies, rich peasants, merchants, small factory owners, bourgeois elements, intellectuals, and various political groups, such as the bourgeois parties.

The Yugoslav political leaders stubbornly deny their ideological errors, believing that the Yugoslav Communist Party cannot and should not have its own distinct platform within the People's Front. In the Yugoslav political arena, only the People's Front is active, while the Communist Party and its various organizations do not openly act in their own name before the people. This fact not only reduces the role of the Communist Party in the country's political and economic affairs but also undermines its status as an independent political force. Only an independent political force can win greater confidence from the masses and attract more working people to its ranks through open political activities, open propaganda, and its platform. The main principles of the Yugoslav Communist Party originate from the errors of the Russian Mensheviks, who advocated liberating the Marxist party and turning it into a non-party mass organization. All of these situations prove that there is a tendency to liquidate the Yugoslav Communist Party. The Cominform believes that the policy of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party endangers the very existence of the Communist Party and also carries the danger of the decline of the People's Republic of Yugoslavia.

(V) The Cominform believes that the bureaucratic policy within the Party is harmful to the life and progress of the Yugoslav Communist Party. There is no democracy within the Party, the principle of elections has not been realized, and there is no criticism or self-criticism. Despite various verbal assurances from Comrades Tito and Kardelj, most of the members of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party were not elected but were selected to fill vacancies. In fact, the Party is legal, and Party meetings are not held or are held in secret. This fact is enough to undermine the Party's influence among the masses. Such an organization can only be called sectarian-bureaucratic. It leads a lively and decisive organism down the road to liquidation. It implements military methods within the Party, as Trotsky implemented. In the Yugoslav Communist Party, the rights of Party members are trampled on, and any criticism of Party procedures is followed by cruel retaliation. This must not be tolerated.

The Cominform believes that this shameful, purely Turkish-style reign of terror must not be allowed to exist in a Communist Party. For the sake of the existence and progress of the Yugoslav Communist Party itself, we demand an end to this regime.

(VI) The Cominform believes that the criticisms made by the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) and the Central Committees of other Communist Parties friendly to the Yugoslav Communist Party have pointed out and corrected all the necessary conditions for restoring its leadership. However, the Yugoslav Communist leaders, influenced by delusions of grandeur, do not honestly accept this criticism, nor do they take the path of courageously correcting their mistakes. Instead, they resent this criticism, adopt a hostile position, and deny their mistakes in an anti-Party spirit, violating Marxist-Leninist Party principles and reconciling themselves to their anti-Party errors.

When the leaders of Yugoslavia proved that they could not defend the criticisms of the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) and the Central Committees of other fraternal parties, they more directly deceived their Party and people. They did not allow the people to know about the criticism of their erroneous policies, and they also kept the real reasons for the dismissal of Comrades Zhujović and Hebrang a secret. (Note: Zhujović was the Yugoslav Minister of Finance, and Hebrang was the Minister of Light Industry.)

After the Yugoslav leaders were criticized by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and other friendly parties, they attempted to implement many left-leaning legal provisions through orders. They hastily issued orders regarding the nationalization of small industries and retail businesses, but there was no preparation for the implementation of nationalization. The haste with which these decrees were issued only made the supply of essential goods to the Yugoslav people more difficult. Similarly, they hastily issued a new law on agricultural taxation, which was also not adequately prepared in advance, and only served to disrupt the food supply to urban residents. Finally, they used grand declarations to proclaim their love and reverence for the Soviet Union, but it is already known that they are adopting a malicious policy towards the Soviet Union.

The Yugoslav Communist leaders announced a policy of liquidating capitalist elements in Yugoslavia. In a letter to the Central Committee of the CPSU(B) on April 13, 1948, Tito and Kardelj wrote: "The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party is working hard to eliminate the vestiges of capitalism in our country."

Based on this concept, Kardelj stated in a speech to the People's Assembly of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia on April 21: "In our country, all forms of exploitation of man by man are coming to an end." The Yugoslav Communist leaders can only be said to be adventurous and un-Marxist in adopting such a path to liquidate capitalist elements and the rich peasant class under the current conditions in Yugoslavia. In fact, this issue has not been resolved in Yugoslavia, because personal economies are still prevalent throughout the country, and personal economies are bound to produce capitalism. The conditions for implementing collective farms have not yet been prepared, and most farmers do not yet understand the benefits of collective economies. The experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has proven that only on the basis of collective farms can the last and most numerous exploiting class, the rich peasants, be liquidated; and the liquidation of the rich peasant class is the main task of implementing collective farms.

In order to successfully liquidate the rich peasant class and all capitalist elements in the country, preparations must be made on the one hand to restrict capitalist elements, strengthen the alliance of workers and peasants under the leadership of the working class, and develop socialist industry. If this is done too hastily, it can only lead to irreparable losses. Only after these preparatory steps have been carefully implemented can the transition from restricting capitalist elements to liquidating capitalist elements be made.

The Yugoslav leaders want to create laws in the yamen in order to hastily solve this problem. Whatever their purpose, they are only expressing that they are engaged in an adventure that is doomed to failure, or else a declaration with ulterior motives. The Cominform believes that the purpose of these left-leaning orders and declarations by the Yugoslav leaders is to cover up their refusal to admit their mistakes and their refusal to honestly correct their mistakes.

### The Garrison Command Will Be Fully Reorganized, with Jurisdiction Extended as Far as Hangzhou; An Overall War Implementation Plan Has Been Drafted and Submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for Approval

The Songhu Garrison Command has received an order from the Ministry of National Defense instructing it to draft implementation measures for implementing overall war. According to inquiries by reporters, the Garrison Command has drafted a detailed plan to further expand the garrison area to the Shanghai-Hangzhou area in order to ensure the security of the garrison area and facilitate command. The command's working principles will be fully and thoroughly reorganized, with several of these being implemented in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of National Defense. All organization, personnel, and planning have been submitted to the Ministry of National Defense for approval in recent days. According to general speculation, the name of the Garrison Command will be changed to the Songhu-Hangzhou Garrison Command.

### Commander Xuan Discusses the Price Issue, Willing to Help the Government Curb the Rising Tide; Investigation Work Has Not Been Relaxed

Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter asked Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu about the price issue. Xuan stated that the continuous rise in prices is causing public unease, so he is willing to assist the government's competent authorities in his capacity as a security official, adopting strict measures to curb the rising tide and suppress prices. However, the effectiveness of these measures will depend on whether the agencies in charge of finance and materials have the determination to make further efforts. He deeply feels that some current laws protecting legitimate industry and commerce are often exploited by opportunistic merchants as a pretext for cover, causing obstacles to the progress of punishing traitors. He also stated that the military and police agencies have not relaxed their investigation of various speculators and illegal merchants and are intensifying their efforts. The investigation work is aimed at the primary speculators in each industry, and the "lackeys" employed by others are not given importance. Punitive actions against traitors will be actively launched based on the principle of "not wronging anyone and achieving effective results." However, in order to achieve the expected results, close cooperation between all relevant government agencies and the greatest determination to work together is necessary.

### Central Government Cables All Agencies to Investigate the Man-Made Factors Behind the Sharp Rise in Prices

The central government attaches great importance to the sharp rise in prices in the Beijing-Shanghai area this time and is aware that this phenomenon is mostly due to man-made factors. Therefore, it has secretly cabled all relevant agencies in the city to secretly investigate the causes and background. Regarding the fact that the Control Yuan intends to organize a Beijing-Shanghai price investigation team to come to Shanghai for thorough investigation, it is reported that the Control Yuan has decided to postpone the investigation for the time being and has cabled the Jiangsu Provincial Supervisory Commissioner's Office to begin secretly investigating and reporting first. The Control Yuan will then send personnel to Shanghai for investigation if necessary after the report is received.

### The Cost of Soap Raw Materials Continues to Rise, Making It Difficult for Small and Medium-Sized Factories to Survive

Recently, the market price of soap has continued to soar. However, according to soap factory merchants, although the price of soap is so high, small and medium-sized soap factories still find it difficult to survive. The most expensive soaps on the market are all products of large factories, and the raw material composition they use is not significantly different from that used by small and medium-sized soap factories. The cost is not much different, but the selling price of soap produced by small factories is often only two-thirds of the selling price of so-called well-known brand soaps produced by large factories, and sometimes even less. At the same time, small factories have short funding and are more threatened by rising raw material costs than large factories. Also, after the sharp rise in prices this time, people's purchasing power has been greatly reduced, and actual soap sales have also greatly decreased. However, well-known brands such as Gu Ben and Xiang Mao are more often used as market bargaining chips, and demand has increased relatively. Therefore, the current situation of small and medium-sized factories is very precarious.

### Funding for Purchasing and Storing Wheat Has Been Agreed Upon in Shanghai by the Ministry of Finance; Tian Yushi Returned to Beijing Yesterday

Tian Yushi, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Food, came to Shanghai to negotiate with the National Bank of China to raise funds for the plan to purchase and store wheat flour. A satisfactory result has been achieved, and he returned to Beijing on the 11th. According to Tian, before his departure, the Ministry of Food currently supplies approximately 1.2 million bags of flour for distribution in the Pingjin area each month. In order to ensure the food supply in North China, the Ministry of Food had previously established a plan to purchase and store wheat flour. The funding required for the actual implementation of this plan is no longer a problem, so the food supply in North China can be said to be assured.

### Salt Merchants from Huaibei in Shanghai Request Reasonable Adjustment of Market Prices

Qiu Menglin, a salt merchant from Huaibei in Shanghai (i.e., salt producer), and more than 150 other people, including Weinong, believe that the Huaibei Salt Affairs Administration has never collected opinions from the merchants when adjusting market prices in accordance with the provisions of the salt administration regulations, resulting in a situation where the market price is too far away from the rise in the necessary production costs, creating an unreasonable phenomenon, affecting the ability to regenerate production, and reducing national tax revenue. Recently, they have jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Salt Affairs General Bureau, requesting that a reasonable adjustment be made again with reference to the price index in order to maintain production and enrich national taxes. It is reported that the authorities have agreed to consider it.

### Increase in Pig Bristle Exports; Industry Hopes National Bank Authorities Will Quickly Plan for Loans

Zhang Yizhi, a giant in the pig bristle export industry, expressed his views on the recent export dynamics and future prospects of the industry on the 11th, stating that since the implementation of the new foreign exchange settlement method, the amount of rigorous exports has increased sharply by more than 100% compared to the previous months. According to the June export settlement figures, the value of pig bristles in Shanghai alone has reached as much as 1.8 million US dollars, indicating that the new method has a considerable effect on encouraging exports. However, this is a temporary phenomenon due to the backlog of export materials from the previous two months due to the unsuitable exchange rate, which have been enthusiastically exported after the change. As for materials from the production areas, exporters are limited by their financial resources and cannot go to purchase large quantities. Before the new method, exporters could borrow 70% of the loan from designated banks with foreign letters of credit, but now they can only borrow 20%, and it is becoming more difficult to transfer funds. If this is forced for a long time, the risk of pre-settling foreign exchange and pre-selling certificates for legitimate exporters will increase, and their purchasing power will decrease. It seems that the government's efforts to maintain this are not thorough. Therefore, all industry members hope that the National Bank authorities will quickly formulate proper loan methods for export materials and implement them as soon as possible. The second half of the year is the peak season for pig bristle production, which is the most important. Otherwise, once the season has passed, the goods will be abandoned on the ground, and the invisible foreign exchange losses will be difficult to compensate for.

### In the Case of the Conflict Between Tram Workers and the Air Force, We Are Quietly Awaiting a Fair and Reasonable Resolution; The Result of the Joint Military, Police, and Military Police Trial Is Still Unable to Determine Responsibility

[Our Own Dispatch] In the case of the conflict between British tram workers and Air Force personnel, the temporary joint military tribunal organized by the military, police, and military police interrogated the issue of responsibility for the incident overnight. However, both sides held their own views, and the injured tram driver and ticket seller were unable to appear in court to testify about the assault. The workers' representatives were also unable to provide strong evidence, so it was difficult to determine who was at fault for the time being. Finally, Liu Jinyi, the injured Air Force mechanic, was ordered to be handed over to Zhang Weihua, Director of the Supply General Office of the Air Force Supply Command, and transferred to the Air Force Hospital for treatment, to be available for questioning at any time. After the workers provide evidence, he will continue to be questioned. The details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, Yan Zi, the leader of the 2nd Brigade of the Garrison Command, who is responsible for investigating the case, told reporters that the results of the interrogation the night before could not prove that the Air Force committed the crime of assault. If the workers can provide evidence, the authorities will severely punish the perpetrators. Also, Qiu Changjiang, Chairman of the British Tram Industry Union, told reporters that the injuries of driver No. 802 are still severe and have not yet improved. However, the workers expressed their trust in the handling of the military, police, and military police authorities and are now quietly awaiting a fair and reasonable resolution. Yesterday, all British tram lines left the factory on time and operated normally.

### The Pain of Loving Beauty: Soaring Prices of Cosmetics and Clothing Threaten Working Women - One Month's Salary Only Buys Three or Four Pairs of Nylon Stockings

[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] Prices continue to skyrocket! Suppression by the military and police, and inspections of warehouses, have not stopped the surging tide of inflation. This is particularly difficult for salaried workers, especially working women. Of course, practically speaking, a simple blue cotton cheongsam could suffice, but loving beauty is a woman's nature, especially in this male-dominated society.

Today, when a working woman receives her salary, she can't even think about how to buy some gold or foreign currency to maintain its value. Their most important task at the end of the month is how to rush to the department store as soon as they receive their salary to buy what they need. In a corner of the accounting office, it's often as noisy as if a chicken coop has been overturned: "Lizhen, will you come with me to buy a tube of Max Factor lipstick later?" "Okay, I also want to buy a pair of nylon stockings, you know you won't be able to buy them anymore if you don't buy them now." Or "Qiuli, I didn't want to make a summer cheongsam, but when I took them out of the box, none of the collars were high enough." "Tailors will be against us, and so will shoemakers." "Mary, my hair is all straight, I have to get it done today."

**A Few Prices - Stunned to See**

But when they rush to the department store, a price list being revised in the clerk's hand scares them speechless:

Type 54 Nylon Stockings $15,000,000

Max Factor Lipstick $8,500,000

Also Rouge $4,500,000

Swatow Handkerchief $5,000,000

Evening in Paris Perfume $10,000,000

American Silk Fabric $15,000,000

The clerk says, "You're a step late, it was much cheaper a moment ago." These young ladies, with rare humility, say to the clerk: "We are regular customers, can you give us the old price?" The clerk smiles bitterly and says: "The boss told me to change it, I'm very sorry, I can't make an exception! The boss said: The cost of living has risen again, how can the prices not change?" So the ladies' plans and budgets are all ruined. They stand at the counter, stuck and unable to move forward or backward, and the clerk cleverly tempts them: "Miss, you should buy it! Maybe it will rise again tomorrow, prices follow the US dollar." They understand, but who knows what tomorrow will bring? Anyway, the price won't drop, so just buy it."

After buying it, stepping out of the store, they can't help but feel annoyed. Last month's salary could still buy four pairs of Type 51 nylon stockings, now it only buys three.

The lady whose hair was straight originally wanted to get a perm, but when she asked the price, it was three million yuan, so she immediately changed her mind and only had the hairdresser do her hair, which was also not cheap, one million four hundred thousand yuan. Naturally, the fifty thousand yuan for a manicure has been saved.

**Pursuing a Handkerchief - Disregarding Life**

Nowadays, working women have to constantly study clothing. First, from Monday to Friday, they don't easily wear nylon stockings, anyway, bare legs are still considered fashionable in the summer. On the same days, voile and American silk cheongsams also have to be saved. Fortunately, English printed cotton looks decent enough. In addition, glass handbags and white leather shoes are of course made of second-rate materials. On weekends, because there are usually some social engagements, they use their full set of the latest 1948 equipment.

When wearing the latest equipment to social events, their value often reminds them to be careful, don't lean on the back of a rickshaw, and don't let the oil stains on the awning stain your cheongsam! But, damn it! The more careful you are, the worse it gets! Suddenly, a gust of wind blew away the double-sided embroidered Swatow handkerchief in her hand. Thinking of its value of several US dollars, she hurriedly jumped out of the car to chase it, regardless of everything. This startled the passersby, who couldn't help but blurt out: "Hey! Car!" It turned out that a DeSoto car was passing by her. It was really dangerous! But she didn't feel it at all, because her nerves were tense and her attention was focused on the lost handkerchief. Only when she picked it up did a smile appear on her face.

**With Family Burdens - Needless to Say**

The "jitterbug" that was once popular on the dance floor has now been gradually abandoned by the ladies, not because they are afraid of sacrificing sweat, but because its movements are large and intense, which can easily damage glass silk. Breaking a pair of nylon stockings is a serious threat to the ladies these days. Even if, luckily, the area of ​​the run is not large, a mending fee is still an unexpected loss!

As for working women who are already mothers, their radiance is even dimmer. She said: My Beibei is sick, a bottle of 10MG Vitamin B is six million, my husband was laid off, and now he can only help me consume the household rice!

### Miniature Combined Printing Letters - Chen Gongzhe Explains Advantages - Transforming Complexity into Simplicity - A Major Invention in the Cultural World

[Report by Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Literary Writers Association held its 63rd literary symposium at the Hongtu Hall of the Daguan Society at the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Ma Huo Road at 4:00 PM yesterday. Dozens of writers, including Wang Jinshan, Yan Duhe, Shi Chongpeng, and Lu Danlin, attended. Pan Gongzhan, the chairman of the association, presided over the meeting. The "Miniature Combined Printing Letters" designed by Chen Gongzhe, a famous archaeologist and inventor, were introduced at the meeting. Mr. Chen has extensively studied philology. Feeling that Chinese characters are too complicated and have many shortcomings, he began to sort them out and discovered that most characters can be analyzed and combined from several basic letters. Therefore, the 10,000 commonly used characters can be reduced to 400 to 2,000 basic letters. However, if there are only 400 basic letters, complex characters often require four to seven combinations, which is not simple enough. If there are 2,000 basic letters, although the number of combinations can be reduced, the number of letters is still too large. Therefore, Mr. Chen set 1,000 letters as basic letters, which can be combined into any commonly used Chinese character. In application, on average, 60 out of every 100 characters are original letters and do not need to be combined. 38 characters need to be combined from two letters, and two characters need to be combined from three letters. This does not cause any inconvenience or waste of time.

**Different Lengths and Widths - Letters Vary**

When these letters are used for printing, they are carved from wooden blocks. Because the shapes of the letters vary in length and width, the size of the combined characters is slightly different (as shown in the picture). However, Mr. Chen believes that this is not a problem, because Western characters also have differences in length and width. The shape and size of the letter wooden blocks are divided into: (1) square characters, 4 mm long and 4 mm wide; (2) rectangular, 4 mm long and 2.66 mm wide; (3) narrow characters, 4 mm long and 1.33 mm wide; (4) flat characters, 2 mm long and 4 mm wide; (5) particularly flat characters, 1 mm long and 4 mm wide; (6) small square block characters, 2 mm long and 2.66 mm wide; (7) right-angled characters, 5.33 mm long and 4 mm wide. Having 20 of each of these 1,000 letters is enough for a small printing shop to print documents and newspapers.

**Promoting Culture - Great Usefulness**

Mr. Chen also designed an inclined wooden tray to hold the letters, classified by four-corner codes, which is very convenient to retrieve. Its area and weight are 94% less than using ordinary lead type, and the cost is very low and convenient to carry. If it can be applied to townships or small cities, it will be of great use in promoting culture. In addition, Mr. Chen also plans to apply the combined letters to literacy education to achieve twice the result with half the effort. He is currently compiling rhyming teaching materials, and hopes that literary writers will assist in completing this work.

**Elderly Renowned Doctor - Lecturing on Teaching Methods**

Ding Fubao, a renowned doctor who is already 75 years old, also attended the meeting. He also has considerable experience in the study of Chinese literature. He believes that the current teaching methods of elementary school teachers are too dull and outdated. They do not know how to use interesting analysis to arouse children's interest. For example, when it comes to literacy, the character "王" (king) can be explained as three strokes representing heaven, earth, and man, and the vertical stroke in the middle connects heaven, earth, and man, which is the king. Another example is the character "雨" (rain). The stroke above is the sky, the curved shape is the cloud, the middle line is the tree, and the four dots on both sides are raindrops, which together form the character for rain. If it can be explained in this way, children will definitely remember it deeply, he said. The famous writers at the scene were very interested in Mr. Ding's opinions, and were particularly impressed by his youthful spirit despite his old age. The symposium ended happily in laughter.

### Cooperative Inspection Team - Sets Off in Groups to Work

### Female Doctor Advocates Eugenics and Birth Control Movement - Already Supported by the Authorities - Plans to Establish Guidance Station

[Report by Our Newspaper] A Chinese Eugenics and Birth Control Promotion Association advocating the birth control movement has recently emerged in this city. The host is Dr. Sun Yanyu, a female doctor who is already over 50 years old. The association also gave four public speeches at the YMCA the day before yesterday, calling on citizens to deeply recognize the importance of eugenics and birth control. Dr. Sun believes that "sexual behavior" has been widely valued in various countries, but in our country, it still seems to carry a mysterious color, and no one has ever conducted systematic research and discussion on it. As a result, sexually transmitted diseases are prevalent among workers, cultural circles, and the working class. Moreover, due to difficult living conditions, they are unable to afford to raise children, and cases of abandoning babies are not uncommon. All of this affects family happiness on a small scale, and damages the morality of the entire society and nation on a large scale. Therefore, she is willing to emulate the "Marie Stopes" of China and is determined to actively explain the true meaning of "sexual life" in response to the current serious social pathology, and thereby promote eugenics and birth control. According to Lu Hong, the executive director of the association, the purpose of the association has now received enthusiastic support from the Municipal Health Bureau and the medical community. Their first step is to plan to establish a "Eugenics and Birth Control Center Guidance Station" in this city to accept inquiries, discussions, and criticisms from all walks of life as much as possible, and also to explain the theories and techniques of various contraceptive methods. Dr. Sun also went to Beijing last night to present her opinions to relevant authorities, hoping that the government can support the promotion of this work with the greatest strength. The slogans revealed by the association include: "Parents who actively give birth to children are the truly sacred parents! Accidental unintentional birth is a sin!" etc. It is said to be based on the principles of the International Planned Parenthood Federation. The association emphasizes that the unlimited increase in population is a sign of cultural backwardness. They also cited the provisions of US federal law on eugenics and birth control, hoping that our country can also add a law to encourage birth control in addition to the criminal law that passively punishes abortion, so that this society, which is disturbed by "sexual behavior" and suffers from pathological conditions, can recover as soon as possible.

### Tianyuan Factory is Testing - Domestically Produced Degummed Ramie

Tianyuan Industrial Company's hemp, wool, and cotton weaving factory, founded by industrialist Rong Desheng, has been preparing for the export of domestically produced degummed ramie for more than a year, and has gradually started operations. According to Yang Tongde, the chief engineer of the factory, the ramie weaving is the first of its kind in China. Except for the China Textile Corporation, Tianyuan is the only private company. However, the degumming method is still in the experimental stage. In the future, if there are satisfactory results, the export prospects will be very optimistic. The factory expects to have mass production within this year. Most of the machines used are ordered from the United States and are the first batch to be exported after the war. It has now started operations with approximately 10,000 spindles. The daily production volume is 25 pieces of 20-count standard yarn, 5,000 yards of ramie cloth, 2,000 pounds of ramie thread (this thread is used for leather shoe soles and will be exported in the future), and 2,000 pounds of wool yarn. The results are still good. Regarding the source of raw materials, it is said that although cotton is lacking, textile weaving is the mother of light industry. The government is determined to find a way to maintain it and will definitely help solve the cotton difficulties. The raw material for ramie weaving is ramie, which is abundant in domestic production, has long fibers, and is very strong in tension. Now the United States has paid attention to this domestic specialty of ramie. Only the source of wool still depends on imports. The factory can only allocate 100,000 pounds per month. If two machines are started every day, it will be used up in more than 20 days. The current stock of wool materials is only enough for a few dozen days.

### This Year's National Cotton Fields - More than 39 Million Mu - Estimated Cotton Stock Exceeds 22 Million Dan

The Cotton Production Improvement Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the National Cotton Textile Industry Federation jointly announced the estimated national cotton fields and the national cotton stock for the 37th year as follows on the 11th:

**National Cotton Fields - Little Increase**

(1) Estimated National Cotton Fields in 37 Years: This estimate (1) is based on the investigation and estimation reports of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Su, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces, and (2) is based on the situation at the end of May this year.

The 12 provinces in the main cotton-producing areas this year have a total of 39,525,000 mu of cotton fields, which is only more than 1.7 million mu compared to the last report of 37,777,000 mu last year (the total national cotton fields of 38,861,000 mu last year included 1,084,000 mu in Gansu, Yunnan, Fujian, Liaoning and other provinces). The increase is not much. This is closely related to domestic security. Comparing the provinces, except for Shandong Province, which has a relatively large increase, Hebei, Shaanxi and Jiangsu have also increased slightly, and the rest are not as good as last year. In Jiangsu Province, cotton fields in the Jinghu area have increased, while those in Subei have decreased. This is also enough to show the influence of security and the amount of cotton fields.

**Investigation in Bandit Areas - Cannot Be Conducted**

The investigation work in bandit areas has not been able to proceed smoothly. For example, in Henan Province, only the eastern, western, and part of the central production areas of Henan Province were investigated on the ground. The rest were estimated after repeated inquiries. The same is true in Shanxi Province. In Jiangsu Province, Shuyang, Fucheng, Lincheng and other counties, in Hebei Province, Wucheng, Nanpi and other counties, in Shaanxi Province, Hancheng, Baishui and other counties, in Anhui Province, Fuyang, Fengtai and other counties, and Wei relied on special circumstances, or because traffic was blocked, all were completed by estimation or correspondence investigation. In Hunan Province, some production areas could not be fully investigated due to obstruction.

The cotton field investigation this year was started early, hoping to be published as soon as possible. However, the bandit unrest has not ended, or postal and telecommunications are blocked, and news is difficult to communicate, or it is in the midst of war, and it is impossible to carry out the work. Although we have tried every means to overcome it, it has not met the ideal.

**Warfare Everywhere - Work is Difficult**

(2) The first national cotton stock estimate in 37 years:

This estimate (1) is based on the situation at the end of May this year, (2) this year's estimate focuses on the cotton stock of cotton farmers, and also includes the cotton stock of some commercial firms and peddlers, (3) local cotton farmers in Hebei Province have the habit of storing seed cotton, so this article records its number separately. A small amount of seed cotton is also stored in a few cotton-producing areas such as Fengxian in Jiangsu Province, which is also recorded according to the facts. The estimated total amount in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces is 2,241,466 thousand dan.

Although the estimation of cotton stock began last year, it is still in its initial stage this year. The work is difficult, and the flames of war are everywhere, and the progress is hindered a lot. Cotton merchants and firms have many concerns, and the reports are far from detailed. Even in terms of this year's estimate, the records of Hebei Province and Jiangsu Province are still satisfactory, but there are still some counties that cannot estimate the flower stock of commercial firms or cotton peddlers. In other provinces, only 21 counties such as Qidong and Linqing in Shandong Province, the eastern counties of Henan Province and 28 counties such as Yanbin, 29 counties such as Xianyang Xingping in Shaanxi Province, 12 lake counties in Hunan Province, and 20 counties such as Huaining Dongliu in Anhui Province have been investigated for cotton stock, and the rest are missing. Although not a complete picture, it has done its best.

### Yong'an First Factory Worker Steals Goods - Jumps Off Building Out of Fear and Dies

[Report by Our Newspaper] On the 28th of last month, Yong'an First Yarn Factory in Hudong Xihu Road lost two pieces of Jincheng brand fine cloth, totaling 80 bolts. The factory discovered it the next morning and reported it to the Yangshupu Police Branch. Chief Wang ordered Ji Bingquan, the criminal section chief, to investigate. Qiu Yongkuan, a worker at the factory, was arrested the day before yesterday on suspicion of having committed a serious crime. He was immediately taken to the bureau for interrogation. He confessed to stealing the goods and said that there were three other workers who committed the theft with him. He continued to send police officers to investigate and arrested the three accomplices together. They all confessed to the truth. A few police officers accompanied the criminal Qiu to the factory the day before yesterday to demonstrate the process of stealing. Unexpectedly, when he first arrived at the question of the two-story building to the third floor, the criminal jumped off the building to commit suicide when the police officers were unprepared. He broke his bones on the spot and was seriously injured. He was sent to Gongji Hospital for treatment, but he died at noon yesterday. Afterwards, the police bureau sent the body to the autopsy office on Changde Road for examination, and the case file was sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for review.

### Military Vehicle Runs Over a Woman - Driver Abandons Vehicle and Flees

[Report by Our Newspaper] At about 3:10 PM yesterday, in front of No. 270 Datong Road, Zhabei, a military truck sped past and knocked down a woman of about 40 years old in the middle of the road. The wheel ran over the vital parts, and she died immediately. Afterwards, the driver of the truck drove at full speed in an attempt to escape. Fortunately, a nearby police officer saw it and borrowed the car on the side of the road to follow. As soon as he chased to Xishi Street, the military truck driver fled. It is reported that the military truck number is Jun 〇 2429, and the name of the driver who caused the accident is Jiang Fenyu. As for the woman who was crushed to death, she was wearing a self-spun silk shirt, black silk trousers, black satin shoes, a gold ring on the middle finger of her right hand, a copper needle hoop on her left hand, and earrings on both ears. Her family can go to the Zhabei Police Branch to claim the body.

### Want to Know "The World to Come" Tore Up the Red Silk Curtain - A Big Loss for the Great Shanghai Theater

[Report by Our Newspaper] The Great Shanghai Theater at No. 500 Xizang Road opened the morning film yesterday, as usual, to entertain the national army. At about 10:30 a.m., the theater screened "The World to Come." Before 10:00 a.m., all the seats in the theater were declared full, and there was almost no room for those who came later, so they jumped onto the stage one after another. The theater staff could not stop them. Many people roared loudly and tore down the red silk curtain, which was very tense. Later, the Lao Zha Police Station received a report and led by section chief Jiang and section member Xue Yunbo and other military police officers arrived at the scene to persuade them. The film continued to be screened, and the storm subsided. Afterwards, the general manager of the theater, Ren Jinping, told reporters that the loss of tearing down the silk curtain was about 4 billion yuan in legal tender. The Film Association will send someone to the theater to investigate.

### Discovery of Chu Culture Relics: A Record of Ancient Artifacts Unearthed in Changsha (Conclusion)

— Jiang Xuan Yi

[Special Dispatch from Changsha, Our Newspaper, 1st] Many artifacts have been unearthed in Changsha, but very few have been preserved. There are two or three shoes, a large number of sword sheaths and silk used to wrap feathers, all completely destroyed by the soil. I have a few fragments. Also unearthed was a piece of fine silk painting with writing and strange books (only one piece). The original was borrowed from a certain antique dealer by a beauty with a deposit of one thousand yuan, and has not yet been returned. This Warring States document can be considered a national treasure and should be recovered by the state. This document on silk backing was originally enclosed in a bamboo box, a thick stack, but only one piece can be unfolded and read. The silk is fine and dense.

Strange Monster Patterns Awaiting Verification

The patterns on the edges of the silk-backed document include human bodies with horned heads, and one body with three heads, monsters from the "Classic of Mountains and Seas." There are many aspects that need to be verified. In the seven or eight hundred characters of the text, it generally speaks of "mountains and rivers, four green and red emperors, green emperors, and the like." The first sentence begins with the word "畋," which is not found in dictionaries. Only the "Yu Hai Lei Bian" has a similar character, with the local saying "Chu people asking about good and bad fortune." From this document, I can definitively prove that these unearthed objects belong to the culture of the Chu people. As for this document, there are more than eighty single characters. Although the seal script is the same as the inscription on the Prince Ding cauldron in Shou County, many characters cannot be deciphered. I cannot list them all here.

Steel Mirror Unearthed: Qin or Chu?

Among the bronzes, the only beautiful one is the bronze mirror. Because bronze mirrors are personal items, they are made with special care and are likely considered objects for the city dwellers. The characteristics of Chu bronze mirrors are: first, they are thin; second, they have a river-shaped knob; and third, they often have strange birds, beasts, and plant patterns. These bronze mirrors were first unearthed in Shou County, then in Luoyang. Foreigners call them Qin mirrors and say they are products brought into China from the Scythian culture. However, I personally collected more than thirty different bronze mirrors in Changsha, and saw more than three hundred unearthed. Their patterns are quite similar to the patterns on lacquerware, so it may not be inappropriate to call them Chu mirrors.

Various Stone Tools: Tripods, Pots, Cups, and Plates

The material of the stone tools is soapstone, with forms such as tripods, pots, cups, and plates. The amber-colored objects are a lion and a duck. There is a lot of glass, with the large inlaid beads being the most beautiful. Agate and crystal are also unearthed in large quantities, but I am not interested in those without patterns and have sacrificed them. A pair of fire-lacquered bracelets, whose material was unknown at the time, were later identified as rosin after careful observation. There is a character "玟" in the Shuowen Jiezi, which describes this type of material. Hundreds of pieces of ancient jade have been unearthed, but the forms are rarely varied. Gold and silver items include seals, rings, or plate-shaped objects.

Among them, the pottery funerary objects from the Han Dynasty are yellow and green, while those from the Chu period are black, or black with painted patterns. There is also a type of clay tablet with the characters "Ying Cheng" on it. People generally interpret it as "Ying Temple" or "Ying Yuan," but the ones I collected clearly say "Ying Cheng."

National Art: Concentrated Research

Having the opportunity to collect these Chu artifacts, I feel that the best way to collect ancient objects is systematically, to easily understand the customs and art of a particular ethnicity. The patterns on ancient artifacts are actually more important than the writing. Writing is easily unified by political power, while patterns are folk customs and are not easily changed by foreign groups. The cultural history of China before the Han Dynasty was actually different in each region. Therefore, regional research is more interesting than dynastic research by Tang, Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou. As for the accurate dating of these Chu artifacts, one can only hope for a planned excavation, or for archaeological enthusiasts to collect them together, so that the materials can be concentrated for comparative research. Although the ancient artifacts unearthed in the Changsha area are now rarely seen, many strange items remain in the hands of antique dealers. After some time, these precious materials of cultural history may all flow out to foreign countries.

### Jiashan Robbery and Murder Case: Principal Offender Yao Funan Executed

[Special Dispatch from Jiashan, Our Newspaper, 10th] At the end of last year, in the county town, a kidnapping and extortion case occurred, in which a massive sum was extorted, and the victim's body was dumped into an ancient well. The victim was a young man named Cheng Dixian, only seventeen years old. After the incident, the principal offender Yao Funan and seven suspects were arrested by the county police in Longhua and the county town. They were transferred to the local court for further investigation. After dozens of investigations and interrogations over half a year, the verdict was given on the 9th of this month: The principal offender Yao Funan was sentenced to death for robbery, causing death, and deprivation of civil rights for life. Yao's wife, Chen Xiuzhen, was convicted of the same crime and sentenced to life imprisonment and deprivation of civil rights for life. Xu Jinsheng, who received the stolen money, was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. The remaining defendants, Chen Tushi, Zhang Tiancheng, Dai Chuanxian, and Ni Boqing, were all found not guilty.

### Japanese Porcelain Dumping in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia Threatens Jingdezhen Porcelain Merchants

[Special Dispatch from Liangquan, Our Newspaper, 8th] Cantonese porcelain merchants here have received news from Hong Kong that the external sales of Jingdezhen porcelain in Hong Kong have recently been hit by the dumping of Japanese porcelain. Since Japan has expanded its foreign trade, it has dumped a large quantity of its existing porcelain in that area. The sales of Chinese porcelain in Southeast Asia have been greatly affected. Porcelain merchants in this city, who consider Hong Kong and Southeast Asia as the main sales markets for Chinese porcelain, are currently devising countermeasures to try to save the critical situation.

### Truth Revealed in Shenyang Love Murder Case: Paper Package Falls from Taifeng Restaurant

The Culprit is a Young Military Officer

[Special Dispatch from Panyang, Our Newspaper, 7th] The investigation results of the murder case at the Taifeng Restaurant in Beishi Market, Panyang, on June 30th, have fully clarified the situation. It is a marriage tragedy under the control of old ethics. The 19-year-old girl, Qiu Xiqing, who was blown to death, and the young military officer who committed suicide after disgracing his family, were in love with each other and wanted to be together. However, the conservative local customs caused laughter. The girl's father, upon hearing this, was furious and sent the girl to Shenyang in April, forcing her to find another home. The girl did not dare to disobey her father's orders, so Wu Wang Rulan introduced her to Liu Hanwen for engagement. According to Liu Hanwen, Qiu Xiqing, her brother-in-law, and sister-in-law looked distracted at the banquet, and Qiu looked even more worried. Wu Wang Rulan said that at that time, Qiu saw the young military officer enter the next room, and they whispered to each other, looking very uneasy, and went downstairs several times. It is reported that when the incident occurred, a small paper package fell from the Taifeng Restaurant. A child from the neighboring Zhongmei Stationery Store picked it up. Inside were two talisman symbols, named Zhang Jiabao and Shi Yuyou, and two travel permits. From this, it is inferred that the military officer involved was either Zhang or Shi, who had a relationship with the girl, and hated her for being unfaithful, so he committed the crime.

### Fake Songjiang County Magistrate Chang Shijie Escapes Prison; Jiangsu High Court Police Illegally Release Traitor; Bailiff Cao Gengsheng Arrested; Major Fugitives Still Being Pursued

[Special Dispatch from Suzhou, Our Newspaper, 11th] Yang Shijie, the fake Songjiang County Magistrate, was previously arrested by the Jiangsu High Court and sentenced to seven years in prison. He was detained in the Wu County sub-prison on Siqian Street and was still undergoing review by the Supreme Court. In the afternoon of the 10th, the Criminal Division of the Jiangsu High Court suddenly discovered that the Yang criminal had been privately released on the afternoon of the 9th by someone who had stolen the High Court's seal, the personal seals of the presiding judge Yao Fuxiang and the clerk Yan Youzhi, as well as the arrest and release warrants. The High Court and the Local Court dispatched bailiffs to search everywhere and thoroughly investigated the police officers involved in the illegal act. It was quickly discovered that the thief who stole the seals and arrest and release warrants was the Criminal Division bailiff Cao Gengsheng, who had abandoned his post and fled to Shanghai, hiding at 44 Jumen Road. The chief bailiff Su Shunmin was immediately dispatched to arrest him and bring him back for questioning. He confessed to bribery and conspiracy to release the prisoner. He was immediately handed over to the Wu Local Prosecutor's Office for investigation according to law. As of the time of this reporter's writing, the fugitive and other police officers involved in the illegal act were still being investigated.

### Shenyang Under the Iron Wings

— Our Reporter Zhao Zhan

[Special Dispatch from Panyang, Our Newspaper, 8th] Since the land transportation between Panyang and the interior has been cut off, becoming an isolated island beyond the border, the population has flowed south in large numbers. The number of people flying in the air accounts for about three-tenths of those crawling on the land. The population of Shenyang in March was 1,130,000, in April it was 1,122,000, in May it was 993,000, and in June it was 996,000. It decreased month by month, but June was 3,000 more than May, possibly due to an increase in refugees. This is the largest population evacuation in Qingyang's history. Recently, air transport has been strengthened. Under the situation of iron wings covering the sky, people generally realize that where can they escape to in a vast foreign land? They hesitate to move forward. All of this is like a chaotic dream. Now everyone is no longer anxious about airplane tickets, but worried about the air transport office. It is a great loss for the planes to return empty. On the contrary, it is more difficult to get to Panyang from Beiping than to climb to the blue sky. It is said that even black market tickets are hard to buy.

Air Exchange of Population and Food

Population and food are exchanged in the air. Everyone takes away a hungry stomach, and every plane comes back full of food. However, the food shortage situation in Panyang has not improved and is becoming more serious.

Someone made a small statistic: In the Xiaoxi District, which is known for its commercial prosperity, most of the residents were well-fed families. But now, about half of them eat chaff and bean cakes, and many of the other half drink thin porridge. On the main streets of Panyang, women and children scramble to pick up tree leaves to make a living, and those who collapse from hunger can be seen everywhere.

Impoverished People Oppressed: Suicide by Drowning

Cases of suicide due to the oppression of life are heard almost every day. Here are two examples of suicide victims: (1) Wang Shen, a 57-year-old street vendor at No. 21, Section 4, Xiaodong Street, was never full even after eating bean cakes every day. Feeling deeply disillusioned with life, he drowned himself in a water tank on June 26 while his wife and daughters were asleep. (2) Zhao Lianju, a resident of No. 2, Lane 3, Furen Street, Tawan District, was poor and without food. He died of illness, leaving behind his wife (28 years old) and a son. After his death, he had no money to buy a coffin. In grief and anger, he poisoned himself to death on June 24.

On July 5, the Northeast Materials Adjustment Bureau announced the cessation of food rations for the families of public school personnel, which was like a bolt from the blue. Someone in the office complained loudly: "Does the government still need civil servants? It would be better to ask Yang Mei to work in the office."

Selecting Special Police to Maintain Order

Along with the soaring prices, there has been an increase in theft and robbery cases. According to figures released by the municipal government, there were 36 theft cases, 7 robbery cases, and 1 snatching case in June. However, a review of the statistics for May is shocking: 30 robbery cases, 180 theft cases, and 10 murder cases. I believe this statistic is more complete and accurate. The number of murder cases in June actually increased compared to May, which is enough to show the economic downturn and instability of society. To maintain order, the police department has selected 21,385 special police officers in various districts, dedicated to collecting intelligence.

In the increasingly deserted Shenyang, the only crowded scene is on the trams. Many soldiers, relying on their arms and courage, hang outside the trams, speeding through the city, which is not only unsightly but also worrying. Thirty-two trams run every day, with an average of 92,000 passengers per day, of which one-quarter do not buy tickets.

Urban Demonstration Area: Strengthening Municipal Administration

In addition, a description of an urban demonstration area is needed to get a glimpse of the municipal administration. The policies promoted in this demonstration area are as follows: (1) Requiring shops and households to set up sanitary water buckets to prevent dust from flying around. (2) Designating garbage dumps in each Bao and transporting newly generated garbage every day. (3) Repairing five public toilets for the convenience of citizens. (4) Planting 1,400 roadside trees. (5) Establishing four literacy classes for women and children. (6) Convening household head meetings to explain district policies. (7) Visiting families of soldiers who have enlisted. (8) Teaching residents to sing "Protect the Northeast Song." (9) Strengthening citizens' cooperatives. (10) Conducting a survey of the lives of the extremely poor. The results are quite remarkable.

### Letter from Two Railway Bureaus

A letter from the Business Office of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau reads: "To the esteemed editor: Today's 'Social Services' section of your newspaper contains a letter from Mr. Song Botong criticizing the shuttle buses of our railway. The actual handling situation is hereby replied as follows: The handling of shuttle bus services in the Shanghai urban area by our railway is purely for social service. All operating routes and passenger pick-up and drop-off points along the way are handled in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal Public Works Bureau. We deeply regret the fact that Mr. Song was refused service by the attendant of Route 1 to Jing'an Temple on Tibet Road. However, we should state to Mr. Song that this measure is neither due to any negligence on the part of our railway nor due to the deliberate negligence of the attendant. It is because the Municipal Public Works Bureau has stipulated that when the buses of our railway transport passengers from the North Station to the urban area, passengers are not allowed to board the bus midway; and when picking up passengers from the urban area to the North Station, passengers are not allowed to get off the bus midway. The attendant was strictly complying with government regulations, which resulted in Mr. Song not being able to board the bus. This was not an intentional slight to the customer. We would appreciate it if you could understand this. If the attendants of our railway are disrespectful in speech or attitude, or if there are other cases of abuse, please let us know at any time. We will rectify and improve to meet your expectations. Sincerely, Social Services Column of Shen Bao."

### General Commodity Prices: Silver Market Eases on Weekends, Inflation Spreads Like Wildfire

After the inflation of June, the market seemed to have been washed clean by a violent storm and torrential rain. After the storm, there would naturally be a temporary calm. However, the weather in June and July is abnormal, so after a short period of silence, the market is showing signs of stirring again.

Regarding market trends for selected goods, after the sharp rise, the authorities routinely imposed strict controls, such as inspecting warehouses, supervising markets, and questioning speculators. Under these circumstances, prices generally did not move much, especially in the cotton yarn and grain trades. However, the trend of prices hovered and advanced at a high level, with stability tinged with optimism. By the weekend, it seemed to show a linear upward trend again. Last week, the silver market showed signs of easing. The exchange situation between national banks fluctuated, but the underground interest rates remained high, fluctuating between four and four and a half corners. This is probably because people still expect prices to rise, so they are unwilling to easily release funds.

State-owned and public utilities adjusted new prices one after another last week after the June inflation: (1) Starting from July 9, the prices of passenger and freight on all railways across the country were adjusted, with passenger transport increasing by 90% and freight transport increasing by 150%. (2) The new prices for water, electricity, and gas in this city were adjusted starting from July 4, with water increasing by 175% and gas increasing by 171%. (3) Starting from July 9, the new prices for public transportation were adjusted, with trolley cars increasing by 156%, buses increasing by an average of 156%, small railways increasing by 130%, and ferries increasing by an average of 170%. In short, it is an environment of rising prices, and some people say that the government is also leading the price increases.

The interest rates on loans from national banks were approved by the Joint Treasury last week and still adopted a differential interest rate system, and the calculation method was determined as follows:

A. The interest on various types of loans undertaken by various banks and bureaus shall be calculated separately according to the following grades:

(1) National policy loans: monthly interest of 8.5%, (equivalent to one-third of the listed market interest rate.)

(2) Business loans: divided into the following three types: (1) Export and transportation public utilities with a monthly interest of 1.5%, (equivalent to 60% of the listed market interest rate. (2) Industrial and mining production enterprises with a monthly interest of 1.8%, (equivalent to 70% of the listed market interest rate.) (3) The monthly interest rate for the transportation and sale of daily necessities for people's livelihood is 20%, (equivalent to 80% of the listed market interest rate.) The above-mentioned interest rates at all levels should still be adjusted at any time with reference to the listed market interest rate according to the composite ingredients.

B. The interest rate and discount for each bank's mortgage rediscount and re-mortgage to the Central Bank shall be calculated according to the following regulations:

(1) Interest rate: (1) National policy loans are reduced by a monthly interest of 2.5% compared to the original loan rate. (2) Business loans: A Export and transportation public utility loans are reduced by a monthly interest of 1.5% compared to the original loan rate, B Industrial and mining production enterprise loans are reduced by a monthly interest of 1% compared to the original loan rate. C Loans for the transportation and sale of daily necessities for people's livelihood are still calculated at the original loan rate.

(2) Discount: (1) National policy loans: 80% discount. (2) Business loans: 70% discount. According to the recent Central Bank's listed rediscount interest rate of 8 yuan per thousand yuan, the combined monthly interest rate is 2.4%. Calculated on a compound interest basis of 12 months a year, the sum of principal and interest will increase by about 13 times. The high inflation rate is an inevitable consequence of high interest rates, but with prices jumping so abnormally, how can the government not raise interest rates? Therefore, under the two major prerequisites of assisting in increasing production and stabilizing prices, the authorities' decision on interest rate policy should indeed be deeply considered.

The long-awaited US aid issue was signed on the 3rd of this month by our Foreign Minister Wang and US Ambassador Stuart, representing the Chinese and American governments respectively. So far, a preliminary stage has been completed. According to Foreign Minister Wang's explanation, it is not easy to obtain US aid. China should at least be responsible for the following points:

(1) A small portion of the US aid funds will be used for special construction projects, and a separate negotiation method may be required in the future. The rest is of a grant nature.

(2) The Chinese government promises to reduce trade barriers and promote foreign commercial relations, etc.

(3) The US reserves the right to terminate assistance at any time. From this point of view, US aid also has somewhat unconditional conditions. It is estimated that the value of US aid can make up for more than half of the current monthly fiscal deficit. We do not deny the importance of US aid in stabilizing the economy. How to make good use of it is a major key for the authorities to save the current economic crisis.

The commodity market trend last week was that at the beginning of the week, due to the authorities' strict control, there was very little trading. Idle funds had no way out and poured into the stock market, resulting in consecutive limit-up gains at the beginning of the week, and new prices were frequently seen. It was relatively quiet in the middle of the week, and by the weekend, due to the easing of the silver market, it tended to be enthusiastic again.

The yarn and cloth market saw very little trading at the beginning of the week. By the weekend, the inflation wind rose again. 42-count Blue Phoenix once stood at 1.9 billion on Friday, and Dragon Head Fine Cloth broke the 40 million mark.

In the grain market, because the authorities stipulated on the 4th that the limited price of rice was 16 million, and adjusted it to 20 million on the 7th, there was very little trading in the market. Outside the market, asking prices threatened to directly hit the 30 million mark. Oil and flour also rose in unison. For example, the price of vegetable oil and bean oil was about 50-60 million on the weekend, and the asking price for Bingchuan No. 1 flour hit a new high of 8.9 million. Daily necessities such as cigarettes, soap, and matches fluctuated slightly, but rebounded across the board on the weekend. The remaining categories such as metals, chemicals, and building materials were all hovering and advancing above their peaks.

### Currency and Finance

(1) Silver Market Underground Interest

Last week, the silver market in this city was tighter outside the industry than inside the industry, and tighter in the morning than in the afternoon. As far as the trend of the week is concerned, the silver market gradually changed from tight to relaxed.

The reason why the silver market is tight outside the industry is that the currency is constantly searching for orders and the supply is insufficient. Within the industry, because the old debts were just cleared after the end of June and the new loans have not yet started, the funds are generally loose. As for why the silver market is looser in the afternoon than in the morning, it is because of the influx of remittances from other places in the afternoon. Furthermore, because the national banks reversed from inflows to outflows last week, and idle funds from other places continued to arrive, the silver market in this city gradually became looser on Thursday and Friday.

Speaking of cash chips, they have been generally short and small in the past week. The reasons are nothing more than: First, prices are high, and the circulating chips are relatively scarce; second, since the Yu Guan Bureau prohibited banks from applying for transfers of deficits, banks have tried to compensate with cash for insufficient funds, resulting in a shortage of cash chips during exchanges; third, the cash reserves of national banks are nearing exhaustion, and payments are often felt to be sluggish, leading to rumors of issuing large banknotes again.

Underground interest rates have generally risen in the past half month. The high interest rate of 3.6 corners has generally risen to about 4 corners, and the highest is even 4.5 corners. The rise in interest rates can be said to be the inevitable result of currency depreciation and soaring prices.

Last week, the exchange results of national banks reversed from inflow to outflow. From Friday to Monday, a total of 1.6488 trillion was withdrawn. If the fixed deposits of commercial banks are deducted, totaling 230 billion, the actual withdrawals of banks should be in the range of 2 trillion. A significant phenomenon last week was that the Central Bank's interbank fixed deposits decreased significantly, which was affected by the repeated increases in the interbank lending rate, which exceeded the interbank deposit interest rate.

From Monday to Friday last week, foreign banks had a net inflow of 2.9351 trillion.

The silver market of commercial banks was generally peaceful. Interbank lending was quite high before Wednesday, and lending decreased after Wednesday. Internal turnover was very convenient. The exchange results of banks after the 60th of the month from Monday to Friday showed a net outflow of 3.9526 trillion, and the trend gradually decreased after Tuesday. This also shows the general easing of the silver market.

(2) Internal and External Exchange Rates

Last week, the foreign exchange market proved to have little volatility. It was around 2 million on Monday, once fell to more than 1.9 million on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then rose slightly to 2.07 million on Thursday and Friday. However, the sale period of exchange settlement certificates has been changed from 7 days to 30 days. The Hong Kong exchange rate was generally 1.34 Hong Kong dollars per 100,000 legal tender. The market price of Hong Kong US dollars was 5.37 yuan. Gold rose from 315.75 yuan to 321.25 yuan per tael.

Last week, domestic exchange rates fluctuated. The Guangzhou exchange rate was 400 yuan on Monday, fell to 350 yuan from Tuesday to Thursday, and then increased to 400 yuan on Friday. The Xiamen exchange rate was 450 yuan on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and soared to 600 yuan on Friday. The flow of funds should be very drastic. The Chongqing exchange rate was 50 yuan on Monday, then fell to 10 yuan, and returned to 50 yuan on Friday. The Hankou exchange rate continued to rise, from 100 yuan on Monday to 280 yuan on Friday. The Tianjin discount was 50 yuan except for 20 yuan on Tuesday.

(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

At the beginning of the week, the Chinese stock market was experiencing difficulties due to the authorities' stringent suppression of prices and the inability to trade in the yarn, cloth, and grain markets. Capital had nowhere to go, creating a situation where all streams converged into the stock market. There were also news reports that Yongsha would be holding a shareholders' meeting. The market opened with a limit-up of 6,330 yuan, and other stocks also saw active investment and mostly hit their limit-up prices. In the afternoon of that day, Yongsha immediately called for 6,623, hitting the limit-up price. People were optimistic, creating a situation of overall gains.

On Tuesday, funds continued to pour in, and Yongsha again hit the limit-up price of 6,965 yuan. The market was vibrant, with 20 stocks hitting the limit-up price, and only 5 stocks not hitting the limit-up price.

By Wednesday, after two consecutive days of gains, people were wary of the high prices and sold to take profits. Although Yongsha once reached a new high of 7,200 yuan, it eventually returned to calmness. The overall market fluctuated and was mixed. Yongsha only rose slightly by 35 yuan compared to the previous day, and more stocks fell than rose.

On Thursday, the market situation was still mixed, and people maintained a wait-and-see attitude. New forces were unable to keep up, and old holdings were sold off, resulting in continued declines. As many as 14 stocks declined. Yongsha rose slightly, closing at 7,120. On Friday, due to the influx of remittances, abundant supply, and extremely loose credit, external material prices rose by 20-30%, and the stock market also saw brilliance, reappearing overall gains. Yongsha rose by 710 yuan compared to yesterday, and the trading volume created a new record of 7.5 billion shares, which shows the enthusiasm of funds flowing into the stock market.

The market opened on the weekend with overall gains again, like a raging fire, and people were extremely optimistic. The stock market has seen three overall gains in one week, which is unprecedented. The reason for this should be the impact of the war and too much currency. Funds from all over the world have come to this city, and the prices of various materials have risen. The multiple of gains in the stock market this year is smaller than that of other materials. Furthermore, this week the authorities restricted the market prices of other materials, which made the stock market, which had been in a long-term trend, soar and rise again and again!

The foreign stock market was unable to trade last week due to the authorities' control, so it is omitted.

### Subsistence Allowance Difference for Publicly Funded Students: Political Affairs Meeting Passes 59.8 Billion Yuan, Distributed to Eight Regions, Approximately 1.77 Million Per Student

[Our Nanjing, 11th] The 59.8 billion yuan difference in subsistence allowances for publicly funded students in national schools for June was passed by the temporary Political Affairs Meeting on the 10th. It will still be distributed according to the eight-region standard, averaging 1.77 million yuan per person. This city and Nanjing, Jiangsu, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Wuxing, Ningbo, Jinhua, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Jinjiang, Wuzhou, Changsha, Nanyue, Wuhan, Yichang, Jiangling (Shashi), Yongjia, Kaifeng, Huanggang, Nanchang, Jiujiang (Lushan), Hefei, Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, Kangding, Xianyang, Pengxi, Zhongning, Pingluo, Guangdong, Henan, Zhengzhou, Wuzhongpu and other places are all listed as the fourth region, with a regulation of 1.8 million yuan. See July 2nd's edition for more details. It is also understood that the resolution has been distributed to the education bureaus of each province and city to inform schools at all levels.

### Students of Private Middle Schools Banned for Not Being Registered: Allowed to Enter Schools with Equivalent Academic Ability, Those with Lower Levels Must Lower Their Grade

[Our Nanjing, 11th] The Ministry of Education has issued an order to the education bureaus of each province and city on the 10th to strictly ban private middle schools that have been operating without registration. Taking Nanjing as an example, there are more than ten private middle schools that have been operating after being approved for registration. There are also many schools in other provinces and cities that have been operating without approval. Because the Ministry of Education has repeatedly issued strict bans, there will inevitably be a large number of private middle schools in each province and city that will be closed after the summer. The academic status of the students who have entered the schools is difficult to recognize because the schools have not been approved for registration. However, it will inevitably affect their future education. Our reporter specially inquired about this matter with relevant parties in the Ministry of Education. According to reports, there are clear provisions in the middle school regulations that junior high schools can enroll 30% of the examinees with equivalent academic ability among all the newly admitted students, and senior high schools can enroll 20% of the examinees with equivalent academic ability. In fact, if the students' test scores are good, in addition to the 30% (junior high school) and 20% (senior high school) standards, the scale can still be appropriately relaxed, and the percentage standard can be increased, which can be determined by each school. Therefore, although the academic status of students in private middle schools that have been banned for not being registered will not be recognized, they can still take the exam with equivalent academic ability, which will not hinder their opportunity to enter schools. However, some students, who originally had lower levels and were not admitted because they applied to other registered private or public schools with higher standards, and then transferred to unregistered private schools; these students must not consider the grade of the unregistered private school they are in and take the exam in order. They must lower their grade before they can be admitted. In addition, the Ministry of Education has also formulated remedial measures for graduates of private schools that were not approved for registration during the Anti-Japanese War and the post-war period due to special circumstances, which are recorded as follows: (1) Private middle schools in the recovered areas that could not be registered because they did not move inland, nor were they registered with the puppet organization, and are now approved, the academic status and graduates of the students before registration shall be reported by the school for retroactive recognition and re-stamping. (2) Private middle schools that have not yet been approved for registration shall be registered within a time limit: those that are not well managed shall be investigated and banned immediately. Graduates who wish to continue their studies shall be allowed to take the entrance examination for public and private specialized schools in the 37th academic year with equivalent academic ability. The above measures are limited to reporting to the Ministry before the end of July this year. However, private middle schools that were approved for registration before the war and did not register with the puppet organization during the occupation and are now continuing to operate shall be investigated by each department and bureau to check the past operating situation, and the qualifications of the graduates of the school during the Anti-Japanese War shall be allowed to be reported.

### Statistics on the Development of Education in Taiwan Province: Comparison Between the Japanese Occupation and After the Restoration

[Hualian News Agency Taipei Dispatch] Everyone knows the general progress of education in Taiwan Province in recent years, and everyone knows that the foundation of education in Taiwan Province is very good. During the Japanese occupation, education was very popular. Yes, we can say that when we see those school buildings; but if we study the statistics at that time in detail, we can know that the popularity of education before was limited to the children of Japanese people; the education of our Taiwanese compatriots gradually became popular after the restoration.

National Education

Looking at national education, taking the Republic of China year 31 as an example during the Japanese occupation, the percentage of Japanese children attending school reached 99.59%, while the percentage of Taiwanese school-age children was only 79%. After the restoration, the percentage of Taiwanese school-age children attending school has changed year by year, and the latest statistics have exceeded 80%.

Secondary Education

Looking at the situation of secondary schools, it is even more obvious. In the year before the restoration, the percentage of national school graduates entering higher education was only 8.39%; in the Republic of China year 35, it increased to 22.14%, and in the 36th year, it increased to 33.59%. There was no junior high school before the restoration for junior high school graduates to enter senior high school, so it cannot be estimated; it also increased year by year after the restoration; it increased to 46.51% in the 35th year, and 66.66% in the 36th year. Comparing the number of secondary school students, there were only 42,101 during the restoration period, and there are now 84,630 this year, more than doubling.

Higher Education

As for higher education, the Japanese imposed the highest possible restrictions on the number of Taiwanese youth entering colleges and universities in the province; according to the statistics of the year before the restoration (Republic of China year 33), there were a total of 2,751 students in colleges and universities in Taiwan, and only 548 were Taiwanese; only 5 were in the liberal arts. After the restoration, in the Republic of China year 35, the total number of students in the province's specialized materials and above has increased to 3,129, of which 2,542 are Taiwanese. From this point of view, the future of education in Taiwan Province is still promising.

### National Junior Normal School for Kindergarten Teachers

I. History

The school was founded in February of the state's second year of the Republic of China in Wenjiang Village, Taihe County, Jiangxi Province. It built its own school buildings with a beautiful environment. During the War of Resistance, it enjoyed a high reputation in the southeastern provinces. In May of the 35th year, it moved to No. 66 Dihua North Road (Difeng Road) in this city, temporarily borrowing part of the school buildings from the Municipal Women's Normal School. The school specializes in cultivating teachers for kindergarten normal schools, researching child psychology, and training talent in welfare. High school graduates can apply to the school. After three years of graduation, they will be assigned as kindergarten teachers, kindergarten education teachers in normal schools, and directors of large-scale kindergartens, or engage in work in childcare centers, educational institutions, and other children's welfare organizations. There have been four graduating classes, totaling over one hundred people, working in areas including Sichuan, Guangxi, Taiwan, Jiangxi, Hunan, and cities such as Shanghai and Qingdao.

II. Current Situation

### Baseball League Situation Changes: China Defeats US Army, 5-4, Coming from Behind, Tied for First Place with the Air Force

[Report from Our Newspaper] The situation in the Ranmating British Navy Baseball League has changed due to China's two victories over the weekend and the US Air Force's loss of its winning streak. China, with four wins in five games, is tied for first place with the Air Force, the team with the highest hopes for the championship. The championship will likely come from these two teams. The US Navy still has strong strength and is the only team that can threaten China and the Air Force. The teams below it have no chance of winning the championship. The recent situation of the league is as follows:

American Offensive Fierce

The Chinese team continued its style from previous games, weakening first and then strengthening, although it was twice on the verge of defeat, it was still able to seize the final opportunity and defeat the US Army by a narrow margin of one point. China responded with a new formation. The American army attacked first. Left fielder Bergern and center fielder Maori dismounted and exerted their power, gaining a second. In the third inning, Bergern once again displayed his old trick, adding another point with Bauer's safe hit, making it 3-0. China quickly reorganized its military strength, appointing Yu Changluan as pitcher, Liang Yousheng retreated to the shortstop position, Liang Youwen guarded third base, Bao Guanwen retired, Maori once again followed Chen Cang's old path, attempting to steal home base, Cao Kejia saw through his treachery and made a wonderful kill, and the Army's offensive gradually subsided.

China Opens Up the Game

In the fourth inning, China counterattacked. After Lu Zhaosen got a free base, he stole to second base. Cao Kejia made a wonderful hit to left field, Zhaosen advanced one step further, and Yu Changluan sacrificed himself, sending Zhaosen back to defense, opening up the game for China.

In the sixth and seventh innings, Yousheng and Youwen each scored one point, tying the score at 3-3. In the eighth inning, US Army shortstop Shano scored a point due to an erroneous ruling by the base umpire, and the US Army once again took the lead. The audience was worried about China, but fortunately, the generals responded calmly. Amidst the cheers and encouragement, Lu Zhaosen hit the ball with his old arm, and the ball flew like an arrow, directly to right field, giving China its first home run since its formation, tying the score again at 4-4.

Winning the Final Victory

In the final inning, the outcome was at stake. China defended tightly, killing three generals, first ensuring no defeat. During the counterattack, He Jinben got a free base, and with Youwen and Yousheng's clever hits, he advanced to third base. When Guan Da wielded his bat, the ball hit the left field, and Jinben rushed back, giving China the final victory. The scores of each inning are as follows:

Also, the day before yesterday, the amateur team defeated Patrol 12-11. Yesterday afternoon, the Air Force fought hard for nine innings and was miserably defeated by the Navy 0-1.

### World Games Delegation Donation: Malaysian Chinese Merchants Break Their Promise

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 10th] Several wealthy Chinese merchants in Malaysia, including rubber estate owners, who had previously volunteered to donate funds to our World Games delegation, have now refused to fulfill their donation promises. Sports figures here say that the sudden change in the attitude of these merchants is due to labor disputes, which have created unfavorable situations in the local area, which have greatly affected their business. According to reports from Shanghai, the amount voluntarily donated by wealthy Singaporean merchants and scholars was around US$5,000, for the expenses of our World Games delegation during their stay in London.

### Last Batch of World Games Delegation Departed Shanghai Yesterday Morning for London by Plane

Our delegation to the World Games departed in three batches. The last batch of thirteen people, led by Chief Leader Dr. Wang Zhengting, went to Longhua Airport at 5 a.m. yesterday morning to board China Airlines' T-104 Overlord plane to England. The plane took off at 6 a.m., heading straight for Hong Kong, and then transferring via Kunming and Yangon to Calcutta, staying in India overnight, and then taking a British plane to London. In addition to track and field athletes Lou Wenao and Chen Yinglang, the rest of the team were staff members. Also traveling with them were Dr. Wang's wife, Mrs. Hao Gengsheng, Ms. Gao Zi, and the swimming team leader and coach Xu Minhui. Mrs. Hao is representing our country at the Olympic Games Congress to be held in England. According to Dr. Wang before his departure, this is the third time that our country has participated in the World Games. During this time of suppression of rebellion, limited by funding, we were unable to send more athletes, which is deeply regrettable. Fortunately, if we can win one or two points, it will be enough. Fortunately, the most important meaning of participating in the Olympics is to connect international feelings and promote the spirit of sports. Our delegation will work towards this goal in order to live up to the expectations of the people of the country. The list of those who left Shanghai yesterday is as follows:

(Chief Leader) Wang Zhengting, (Secretary General) Ji Shouyi, (Chief Coach) Hao Gengsheng, (Swimming Team Leader) Xu Minhui, (Secretary) Tian Hanxiang, Feng Chenzhen, (Staff) Shi Zhaokang, Lu Xiangqian, (Assistant Staff) Wu Zhigang, (Track and Field Representatives) Lou Wenao, Chen Yinglang, (Companions) Mrs. Wang Zhengting, Mrs. Liang Gengsheng,

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 11th] Our country's World Games delegation, a batch of fourteen people, led by Dr. Wang Zhengting, arrived in Kunming at 3 p.m. this afternoon aboard the Overlord plane. After a brief stop, they continued their flight to Calcutta.

### World Games Basketball Team Wins All Games, Defeats Singapore Team, 61-33, Situation Quite Dangerous

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 10th] Our World Games basketball team defeated the Singapore team by a score of 61-33 at the Happy World Stadium here today, achieving a complete victory here. The audience at the scene reached over 12,000, the largest audience ever at Happy World Stadium. Eager to see the World Games team compete against one of the best teams here (the team defeated the Philippine Flying Squad last year), the audience had their eyes opened during this game. At the beginning of the game, the World Games team used its usual lineup, with Li Shiqiao, Wu Chengzhang, Cai Wenhua, Bao Songtu, and Huang Tianxi taking the field. The young and competitive Malaysian Chinese team took the offensive with rapid steps from the beginning, and after a fierce battle in the first quarter, the World Games team relied on the accurate shooting of its center Cai Wenhua, scoring three consecutive goals, to compete with the fast-attacking opponent. At the end of the first quarter, the World Games team was one point behind. In the second quarter, the World Games team still could not resist the rapid offensive tactics of the Malaysian Chinese team. The Malaysian Chinese team prepared for long-range shots in the middle of the field against the World Games team, not willing to fall behind, and gradually caught up. In the first half, the World Games team led 26-25. In the third quarter, Bao Songtu committed five fouls and left the field, but he had already scored nine points for the World Games team. Li Zhenzhong joined the game, and because of his calm handling, the World Games team was able to take an advantage of eleven points, laying the foundation for victory. In the final stage, Li Shiqiao and Wu Chengzhang conducted a two-person offensive, scoring six consecutive goals, creating the climax of the most dangerous ball game since the World Games team left Shanghai at the beginning of this month.

### Inside Story of the US Election

— Yu Chuang

There is an American saying: "He who pays the piper calls the tune," meaning that since you have used someone else's money, you should listen to them. This saying is especially suitable for politics. Therefore, the source of campaign funds for presidential candidates is always a deeply hidden secret in the US elections held every four years.

The cost of a US presidential candidate's campaign is a considerable figure. No matter how lofty the candidate's goals or how moving their tone, it would be in vain if no one could hear their speeches. If you want voters to hear your campaign speeches, you have to spend money everywhere. For example, during the last election, Roosevelt broadcast a "fireside chat," which cost $100,000. The Republican Party spent 7,000 yuan in one state alone on advertising at the last minute. This year's costs are naturally much more expensive than four years ago. There are probably 60 million eligible voters in the United States. If you just mail a printed promotional item to each voter, and the postage for each letter is one and a half cents, the postage for 60 million letters alone would be 900,000 yuan, plus printing, paper, and labor costs, the total would be 3 million yuan.

The US Congress has passed a "Hatch Act" to limit campaign spending, stipulating that no "political organization" may spend more than 3 million yuan per year, but everyone still obeys in appearance but violates in reality. The Democratic Party claimed to have spent 2.16 million yuan in the 1944 election, and the Republican Party said it only spent 2.82 million yuan, but according to a survey by Dr. Overlack, a female professor at Wellesley College, both parties cleverly established many organizations similar to their own parties to assist in the election. Therefore, in fact, Roosevelt and Truman's campaign spending that year reached 7.44 million yuan, and Republicans Dewey and Brigg also spent 13 million yuan that year. Dr. Overlack estimates that the total campaign spending for both parties this year will be around 50 million yuan.

Where does this money come from?

Before Roosevelt participated in the election, the campaign funds of the Democratic and Republican parties were paid by the richest wealthy families and the large companies they controlled in the United States. Often the same company would pay two similar amounts, one to the Democratic Party and one to the Republican Party, so the campaign funds of the two parties were often similar. However, when Roosevelt ran for election in 1936, the wealthy families were quite dissatisfied with his New Deal, so the money given to the Democratic Party was greatly reduced. By the time of the second consecutive election of Roosevelt in 1940 and 1944, the wealthy families almost fully supported the Republican Party.

According to the "Hatch Act" mentioned above, each citizen or legal person may not donate more than 5,000 yuan in campaign expenses, but Dr. Overlack said that people who are enthusiastic about helping the election have come up with clever ways to circumvent it, and in fact, they have not been affected at all. For example, the famous arms dealer Dupont once donated 200,000 yuan to the Republican Party in the name of 60 family members. Pew donated 164,500 yuan, but used the names of 12 people. Queeny, the boss of Monsanto Chemical Company, donated 55,000 yuan in the names of three people.

The Democratic Party is different. According to investigations, they have never received donations of more than 10,000 yuan from the same family.

In 1928, half of the Democratic Party's total campaign expenses were supplied by 135 enthusiastic election helpers. Each of these 135 people donated more than 5,000 yuan, and three donations exceeded 100,000 yuan. In the same year, on the Republican side, more than 300 people donated more than 5,000 yuan each. Most of these people were bankers and large manufacturers. The Democratic Party obtained more than 40% of its campaign expenses from this source. By 1944, the situation had changed greatly. Donations from bankers to the Republican Party accounted for 16.7% of the total; the Democratic Party only received 5.2% of the total. Campaign expenses donated by the industrial and commercial sectors to the Republican Party accounted for 24.2% of the total; while those given to the Democratic Party only accounted for 8.1%.

One of the major sources of campaign funds for the Democratic Party is labor unions. In 1936, bankers and industrialists were unwilling to support the Democratic Party, but labor unions came out and replaced them, donating 10% of the total campaign expenses of the Democratic Party; by 1940, labor union donations had increased to 15.9%. In 1944, the "Political Action Committee" in charge of donations and election assistance from the labor union side donated a sum of more than 1.32 million yuan, which caused considerable fluctuations in the political world.

Generally speaking, the Republican Party relies on the help of the "sixty wealthy families" in the United States, while the Democratic Party relies on the support of labor unions; but both parties are also trying their best to raise donations from people with lower incomes. In 1936, the Republican Party appealed to 17 million voters, asking each to donate one yuan to help the election, and as a result, received 400,000 yuan, but the necessary miscellaneous expenses used up about 160,000 yuan; the Democratic Party donated 1 million yuan, which was reduced by 20% after deducting expenses.

Dr. Overlack said that it is a good phenomenon for people to generally donate campaign funds, but unfortunately, it has not exerted its greatest power to this day. Freedom must be paid for, otherwise, "he who pays the piper calls the tune," and the government cannot but take into account the interests of the wealthy a little more.

### White "Blackboard"

— Songpu

In Elgin, USA, a school is now trying a white "blackboard" and black chalk, the reason being to reduce eye strain for students. At the same time, the white blackboard matched with light blue walls can make the indoor light brighter. The result of the trial is that not only is everything as expected, but writing "black" on a white "blackboard" can make it easier to recognize words, which can be described as "killing three birds with one stone."

### Leisurely Poems After Work

A Poem on Ms. Cai Shushen's Pine Shade Fishing Club

Is it possible to fish with leisure, a single boat among ten thousand pine trees? The secluded realm is like the Green Crane Cave, the old home is still remembered as Baiweizhou. Difficult and humble, pursuing books and songs, the world is changing and fickle, Zhujiang's scarf is now good at pearls, and the aura is naturally excellent.

Presented to Porcelain Merchant Mr. Xiang

For twenty years, the tide has ebbed and flowed at Xiepu, and the noble family is distantly descended from western Liaoning. Very similar to the hermit Zhang Chushi of Chuzhou, the family heirloom has Ge ware.

### Summer Vacation

— Bao Zhongqi

Like children eagerly anticipating the New Year, with the graduation ceremonies of various schools, students welcome the arrival of this annual summer vacation.

There are still a full two months before the start of school in early September, but this summer is different from previous years, and I think most students have a different and heavy feeling. And the graduating students of this year are busy looking for jobs, so "summer vacation" is meaningless, and there will be no more enjoyment of summer vacation except for "being a teacher."

Therefore, we students who are about to start our careers cannot help but cherish these last few summer vacations, and we cannot help but feel the lateness of our years. This feeling is almost the same as that of grown-up children who do not like the New Year.

I still remember the several summer vacations in elementary school, all of which slipped away in a muddle-headed and indifferent manner. Upon entering middle school, it happened to be the time when the War of Resistance against Japan was rising, and the people on the isolated island suffered. As our age increased and our knowledge grew, we also began to realize that it was not easy for our parents to prepare tuition fees. Every summer vacation, we saw their worries and anxieties on their foreheads. As children, we only quietly did our "summer homework," and there was no leisure to spend our vacations? After the victory of the War of Resistance, we, this lucky group, thought that we would step onto a smooth path from then on and complete our studies more easily, but who would have expected that the problem still plaguing our hearts today is the huge amount of tuition and miscellaneous fees?

We are happy for the students of this year who are "changing consumption into production," and we are even more saddened for the students who are about to drop out of school. We cannot bear to see the young buds of a school wither away without irrigation. We sincerely pray that the newspaper's readers' school assistance movement will be completed as soon as possible!

### Beans

— Gongsun Wu

Visiting Longhua, the peach blossoms are not worth watching. Under the flower trees, broad beans are planted everywhere, which are about to bear fruit. Planting beans under trees is something I have never seen in my life. I am afraid that I don’t know much about farming, and I find it quite strange. Tiangong Kaiwu says that broad beans are sown in August and harvested in April of the following year. Under the mulberry trees in western Zhejiang, they are planted everywhere. Generally, things do not grow when tree leaves block them, but when the leaves of these beans and peas are lush, they have already formed pods and borne fruit. "Record this to show my foolishness. I also recall one thing. In the past, a newly arrived American agricultural teacher at a certain university took out a handful of vegetable seeds, saying that they were very easy to grow and could be planted anywhere. He heard that China had insufficient food and frequent disasters, so he brought them to spread them as miscellaneous grains, which would be of some help to the people's food. The students listened respectfully and planted them in the experimental field. When they grew, they turned out to be kohlrabi. They laughed together, but this gentleman's good intentions were indeed admirable, so I will never forget them. In my hometown, this vegetable is called badger vegetable, which is most suitable for feeding pigs. Poor and frugal people occasionally eat it, and it is indeed an easily obtained miscellaneous grain with rich flour, which should not be underestimated. Xu Guangqi's Complete Treatise on Agriculture also speaks about it in detail.

### World Miscellany

— Mei

The "Maginot Line" has become a historical term. The French government is now renting out the land around the "defense line" for animal husbandry. The place that used to be full of murderous intent is now "wind blowing grass low, revealing cattle and sheep."

There are currently about 10 million elderly people over the age of 65 in the United States, but only one-tenth of them can retire peacefully and enjoy their old age with their usual savings. The remaining nine-tenths have to rely on other people's help—many people can only continue to work hard for their lives.

The United States has recently invented a small flashlight, only two inches long, that can be hung on a key chain or placed in a wallet. This small flashlight is made quite exquisitely, "the body is made of genuine leather, silver, or 14K gold.

### Feelings After Reading the Newspaper

— Jinjin

When I opened the newspaper this morning, I suddenly had some feelings. What I noticed was not the major news or headlines in the newspaper, but the newspaper itself. In fact, this feeling should have existed long ago, but it was triggered accidentally today.

What I discovered is that the market price of white paper has risen sharply, while books are often unable to sell at a price. This situation is somewhat strange. What readers want to see are books, not blank white paper, and white paper should be printed into books, which is its proper path. If everyone does not want books and all kinds of printed paper, then what is the use of having so much white paper?

Therefore, under the premise of the depression of the book industry, the sales of white paper should decrease, but it is still so expensive, so many newspapers must have gone into the hands of non-publishing industries. As a result, the publishing industry thinks that paper and printing costs are too expensive and cannot move forward, and those who really love to read also think that the prices of books and newspapers are too high and cannot afford to buy them. As a result, the more newspapers rise, the higher the gap between the publishing industry and readers becomes. And the depression of the book industry seems to have become an exact and immutable fact.

Is there any way to remedy this phenomenon? I think there is. One is for readers to run their own cultural undertakings to reduce the gap between readers and the publishing industry. The second is for the authorities to give priority to the allocation of newspapers to those who are truly dedicated to the publishing industry. In this way, the paper shortage problem may be solved, and cheap spiritual food may be supplied.

### Car Prices Rise

— Hong Xian

Car prices have been constantly rising, making it almost impossible for people to travel.

It is said that the price of gasoline is high, so car prices have to rise. It is only natural that public transportation should be included in the price increase, and the reason for this is already very clear. However, if you think about it, there are so many private cars, isn't private enjoyment a bit too much these days? Why not raise their prices a bit more to subsidize public transportation, in order to help the majority of people who cannot afford cars but need to take them?

Taking a step back, if foreign gasoline is expensive, why not extract more domestic oil? If the cost of domestic oil refining is high, why not use gasoline substitutes? I remember that during the war of resistance, many alcohol-powered cars and charcoal-powered cars were used. Why can't they be used again now? If it is for beauty, then we can no longer talk about hardship; if it is to reduce trouble, then we don't need to talk about research anymore. In fact, at present, there are ways, but I am afraid we are unwilling to find them.

### Random Notes on a Mouse Peeking into the Pavilion

— Yu Shou

Chengdu and Beiping

During the war, living in the southwest rear area, every time I went to Chengdu, I would feel "this is also Beiping." Contemporary scholars like to call Chengdu "Little Beiping," but I don't think so.

In terms of historical records, Chengdu is no less than Beiping. There is no need to mention Zhang Yi building the city; just examine the "Biographies of the Money-Makers" in the Records of the Grand Historian, and you will see that Chengdu was already a major economic and cultural city at that time. Beiping, at that time, was probably just a small commandery in Shanggu. In the hundreds of years that followed, after the establishment of capitals by Gongsun Shu and Liu Bei, Chengdu developed sequentially, reaching its peak of prosperity in the Tang Dynasty. The best evidence is Xue Tao. Modern historians often emphasize: using historical materials about the lives of women of servitude in a certain era to infer the level of cultural and economic life in that place and time is often effective. So, aren't the various records about Xue Tao in historical documents enough to explain the prosperity of Chengdu at that time? Beiping only began to have architectural models in the Jin and Yuan dynasties, and only in the Yongle reign did it become known for its complete cultural relics. Although it can be said that it came later and surpassed the former, to "belittle" Chengdu because of this is a historical disorder, which I secretly think is inappropriate.

Why does Chengdu resemble Beiping? In fact, it is only a temporary intuition of those who see it for the first time, and it is not necessarily based on scientific examination. During the Qing Dynasty, Chengdu was a garrison area for generals, and some Banner people settled there. Regardless of diet, language, etiquette, music, clothing, architecture, etc., their living habits gradually penetrated into the residents. The people of Chengdu absorbed it for a long time, digested it, and encountered it again. Therefore, even after the 30th year of the Republic of China, there were still remnants of the prevailing custom to be found. That's all. I have no lofty arguments to make.

If we talk about the climate, Beiping is vast and bright, with no humid clouds in the sky, purely masculine and beautiful, which is very different from Chengdu, which is deep, soft, rainy and humid, and rich. However, they are both darlings of nature, both able to nourish flowers and trees, and flourish fruits and vegetables. In Chengdu, seeing the patrolling sparrows and magpies pecking at grapes, not avoiding people at all, I often think of Beiping—that's all, and I have no lofty arguments to make.
