### The Executive Yuan's Economic Control Commission Approves Measures to Lower Interest Rates of Banks and Private Money Houses; Public Utility Prices and Wages to Be Frozen Based on the August 19th Standard; New Tax Rates to Take Effect Today

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] The Executive Yuan's Economic Control Commission held its first meeting on the morning of the 26th, chaired by Weng Wenhao, who also serves as the head of the commission. In addition to Zhang Wansheng and Jiang Jingguo, who are overseeing economic controls in Ping and Shanghai, respectively, committee members Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, Chen Qitian, Yan Jiagan, and Xu Baiyuan, who also serves as the secretary-general, were all in attendance. Key officials from relevant ministries, including Wang Shijie, Sun Yueqi, Guan Jiyu, Ling Hongxun, and Executive Yuan Secretary-General Li Weiguo, were also present. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM. Three important decisions were made regarding strengthening economic controls: (1) Reduce bank interest rates. In addition to stipulating that national bank interest rates shall not exceed 2.5 to 5 percent per month, the interest rates for commercial banks and private money houses, which were negotiated to be 13 percent per month, were still deemed too high. It was decided to further reduce them. The resolution was to lower the monthly interest rate to within 10 percent starting September 1st, and further reduce it to within 5 percent after September 16th. (2) Approve the procedures for using deposits held abroad after they are transferred to the Central Bank. According to the Presidential Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Matters, foreign exchange assets held abroad by nationals should be transferred to the Central Bank. However, individuals may still use them in accordance with Article 9 of the "Regulations for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets Held Abroad by Citizens of the Republic of China" and Article 4 of the "Regulations for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by Citizens." The procedures for their use were approved liberally during the meeting. (3) Restrict price increases for public utilities and wage increases. The prices of public transportation services and worker wages nationwide should be based on the August 19th standard and should not be increased. The issue of whether adjustments are needed will be decided by the Executive Yuan as a whole at an appropriate time, depending on the circumstances at the time. Individual adjustments will not be allowed. During the meeting on the 26th, the heads of various relevant departments first reported on various situations since the promulgation of the Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Matters three days ago and reviewed them. The overall situation was generally considered satisfactory. In particular, the people's enthusiastic exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currency for Gold Yuan notes in the past three days, which implemented the second item of the emergency decree, was progressing very smoothly and was considered a great success. The prices of food crops have mostly stabilized according to the standards stipulated in the decree, and some have even fallen. However, only a few materials and a few areas have experienced slight fluctuations. According to reports from relevant units, effective countermeasures have been proposed for this phenomenon and will be announced and implemented soon. Prices in major cities across the country, including Peiping, Tianjin, Xi'an, and Hankou, are stable. Beijing and Shanghai have experienced slight fluctuations, while Guangzhou has experienced the most severe fluctuations. Measures are being taken to stop them. Finally, a discussion was held on the measures proposed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to strengthen the management of important materials, control prices, and crack down on hoarding and speculation. A broad exchange of views took place. Because it was already past 1:00 PM, no decision was made and the matter will be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion at the next meeting.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] After the promulgation of supplementary measures for fiscal reorganization, Jiang Bingge, Director of the National Taxation Bureau, said on the 26th that the adjustment of the new tax rates will be implemented starting from the 27th.

### Zhang Lisheng Convenes a Meeting with Leading Business Figures in Peiping

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Peiping, 26th] Zhang Lisheng convened a meeting at 4:00 PM on the 26th with leading figures from Peiping commercial banks, private money houses, and various chambers of commerce, asking for assistance in financial and economic reforms. Zhang said that the government is determined to strictly implement the current price policy based on the principle of "fairness and justice." To avoid excuses for raising prices, public utilities will not increase prices for the time being. Zhang emphasized that individual interests must be lower than national interests. Mayor Liu also said that the rumor that only decreases are allowed but not increases is a misunderstanding. Within the prices of August 19th, the government will absolutely not interfere. The municipal government summoned some merchants who raised prices within the current price on the 25th to inquire about the reasons for the price increase.

### The Control Yuan Will Propose a Censure Against State-Owned Enterprises That Raised Prices After August 19th; Principles Determined at a Joint Meeting of the Transportation and Finance Committees

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] The principle of the Control Yuan proposing a censure against state-owned enterprises that raised prices was discussed at a joint meeting of the Transportation and Finance Committees of the Yuan at 3:00 PM on the 26th. The revision of the wording was decided, and Zhang Dinghua, Tang Honglie, and Sun Yulin were appointed to work together to organize it, and then submit it for co-signing by other committee members before it is proposed. After the promulgation of the Emergency Decree on Financial and Economic Matters, prices were required to be frozen at the level of August 19th and not to be increased. However, transportation enterprises such as China and Central Airlines adjusted their ticket prices from the 20th, increasing them by 85 percent, which caused widespread dissatisfaction. To uphold the emergency decree, the Control Yuan members held meetings separately by the Transportation and Finance Committees on the morning of the 26th to discuss the issue. The Transportation Committee immediately resolved to propose a censure against the price increases by state-owned enterprises. The three resolutions of the Finance Committee were: (1) Transportation enterprises should maintain the "August 19th" prices. (2) If it is to help state-owned enterprises achieve self-sufficiency, the costs should be calculated well and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. (3) How to adjust the prices should be the responsibility of the Legislative Yuan. Subsequently, the Transportation and Finance Committees decided to hold a joint meeting at 3:30 PM on the 26th to continue discussing the resolutions of the two committees. Chairman Sun Yulin first reported on the resolutions of the two committees, followed by a broad exchange of views by the committee members. The principle of the censure was then established. It was also suggested at the meeting that the current members of the Legislative Yuan, the Central Committee, and others enjoy half-price travel benefits, which obviously cause losses to the income of the companies. It would be best to cancel these benefits to increase income and help the companies achieve self-sufficiency.

### Rumors of President Chiang Meeting with MacArthur; Shao Yulin Directly Denies Them; Zhang Qun's Trip to Japan is Purely for Private Observation

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] On the second day of meeting with leading figures in Japanese political circles, Zhang Qun met with Ken Inukai, advisor to the Democratic Party, and Takeo Miki, Secretary-General of the National Cooperative Party, on the morning of the 26th. Inukai visited Zhang at the Chinese delegation at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 26th, but the content of the talks was not disclosed. Following Zhang's meeting with Inukai, Zhang met with Miki at 11:00 AM. It is understood that Zhang praised Miki for his efforts in promoting the work of the party. The National Cooperative Party has been promoting cooperative movements in Japan.

[Another Dispatch] Zhang Qun met with Kijuro Shidehara of the Democratic Liberal Party on the afternoon of the 26th. Shigeru Yoshida was unable to attend due to illness. It is reported that Shidehara explained the current political situation in Japan to Zhang. The two had a two-hour conversation. In the evening of the 26th, "professorial" figures Masao Takahashi and Hyoe Ouchi will jointly visit Zhang. Zhang will also meet with Kuomintang members in the Tokyo and Yokohama areas to hear reports.

[Another Dispatch] The Mainichi Shimbun reported on the 26th that Zhang Qun stated when meeting with Ashida yesterday that China had sought an agreement between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to conclude a Japanese peace treaty as soon as possible. He also said that Japan could not be revived without China's help. Ashida agreed with Zhang's views and assured Zhang of Japan's peaceful intentions. He also said that Japanese militarism would never be revived.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Shao Yulin, former private advisor to Executive Yuan Zhang Qun, directly denied on the 26th the rumors reported in foreign newspapers that Zhang intended to plan a meeting between President Chiang and MacArthur. Shao also said: "Outside speculation that Zhang is charged with laying the foundation for the restoration of Sino-Japanese relations, and with stopping the growth of communism in Asia, and with establishing a Sino-Japanese alliance, to which Korea and other countries may join later," lacks a factual basis. He reiterated that Zhang was not charged with any special official mission. He said that Zhang's visit to Japan was purely a fact-finding tour in a private capacity. Shao concluded that by listening to reports from the Allied Headquarters on the policies and work of the Allied Headquarters, and the opinions of Japanese political leaders, Zhang was only trying to get an impression of Japan after the war.

Commentary

### An Understanding of Confucius' Philosophy of Life - Commemorating Teachers' Day -

Confucius was a great educator of ancient China. Today, as we commemorate the Supreme Sage and Foremost Teacher Confucius, we must first recognize his achievements in education and his academic accomplishments. However, the determination of one's educational theory often depends on one's philosophy of life. Therefore, if we want to understand Confucius' educational objectives, we must first study his various perspectives on the philosophy of life.

Confucius lived in a chaotic era. Externally, the Yi and Di barbarians were strong and evil, and the various Xia peoples suffered humiliation. Internally, the ethical codes were not upheld, wars occurred frequently, and there were excessive levies and taxes, causing the people to live in misery. Therefore, Confucius, with a compassionate heart, made a great vow to save the world and its people, painstakingly exploring and practicing the principles and methods of morality in order to cultivate himself and bring peace to others. As Confucius said, "Shen! My way is consistent." This "consistent way" is the fundamental principle of cultivating oneself and bringing peace to others, as invented by Confucius, and it is also the highest principle of practicing morality. This is not only an original thought of Confucius but also the core of Confucius' teachings. The so-called "consistent way" is benevolence; benevolence is the nature of man, that is, the way of man. In other words, it is the relationship between people and the common rationality between people. Confucius said, "Benevolence is being human." This means that benevolence takes people as its object and is not isolated. The purpose of practicing benevolence is to extend oneself to others and serve others. The so-called "the benevolent loves others" is a concrete explanation of benevolence. Because loving others is benevolence, benevolence can not only be exhausted by the virtue of self-cultivation but must also be achieved by cultivating oneself, managing one's family, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world, reaching the ideal world of great harmony—the world of benevolence—and then the virtue of benevolence can be fully realized. The process begins with self-cultivation and ends with bringing peace to others. Confucius said, "A gentleman does not deviate from benevolence even for the time of a meal. He is sure to be in it in haste, and he is sure to be in it in adversity." The meaning lies in this.

The way of Confucius is based on the pursuit of the realization of "benevolence" as its only doctrine. His words of loyalty and forgiveness are methods for advancing towards benevolence. As Zeng Zi said, "The Master's way is loyalty and forgiveness, and nothing more." Loyalty is a means of self-cultivation; to cultivate oneself, one must first exhaust oneself. "Exhausting oneself is loyalty"; the so-called exhausting oneself must first pay attention to and cultivate the motives of one's actions, which is the effort of self-restraint. That is, one must absolutely reject any improper temptation, and even be willing to sacrifice one's life for the sake of realizing benevolence. "A man of noble aspirations and benevolence will not seek to live at the expense of benevolence, but will sacrifice his life to achieve benevolence." Sacrificing one's life to achieve benevolence can only be done with the spirit of "loyalty"; with loyalty, one can distinguish right from wrong, and one can also firmly adhere to goodness. Secondly, even if we have the proper motives for our actions, we still cannot guarantee that the results of our actions will be satisfactory and good, so we must also have some control over the results of our actions. This is the effort of restoring ritual. Restoring ritual includes two meanings: broad learning and restrained conduct. Broad learning refers to seeking knowledge as preparation for practice, and restrained conduct is the practice of behavior, using the rituals formulated by ancient sages as norms to restrain one's own behavior. Because the knowledge gained may not necessarily help improve individual behavior, one must follow the restraints of rituals, tempered and forged, so that the results of behavior can be reliably grasped.

Forgiveness is a means of bringing peace to others; to bring peace to others, one must first extend oneself. Extending oneself includes two aspects: positive and negative: "What you want for yourself, do for others"; "What you do not want for yourself, do not do to others." The actual paths for its implementation are politics and education. First, in politics, Confucius advocated starting with the rectification of names. He believed that if one wanted to "reverse the chaos and return to righteousness," one must use the means of rectifying names, implementing praise for good and贬斥 for evil, to show encouragement and punishment, so that rebellious ministers and traitors would know what to fear, and the national discipline could be established. Therefore, Confucius revised the Spring and Autumn Annals, criticizing with his pen and condemning in his heart, with the aim of preventing evil from being confused with righteousness. As for his political ideal, it is to seek the realization of the doctrine of virtuous rule. The so-called doctrine of virtuous rule can be explained from Confucius' words "cultivate oneself with reverence," "cultivate oneself to bring peace to others," and "if you lead with righteousness, who would dare to be unrighteous," "when one's person is upright, one will be obeyed without orders; when one's person is not upright, one will not be obeyed even with orders," "lead them with virtue, regulate them with rituals, and they will have shame and be reformed." That is to say, governing according to benevolence and virtue, the country can be greatly governed. Secondly, in education, Confucius advocated cultivating "people," cultivating people to serve the country, that is, the so-called "benevolent." His educational method is entirely his own means of self-cultivation, honestly telling others his own methods of self-cultivation, the so-called "if you want to establish yourself, establish others; if you want to achieve yourself, achieve others." Specifically speaking, that is, when you want to realize benevolence and become your own personality, not only can your completed personality move others, but once you have completed your own personality, you will definitely want to further complete the personality of others. In other words, the loyal can be forgiving, and the forgiving can be loyal. Conversely, if one is not loyal, one cannot achieve oneself and others, how can one achieve others? If one is not forgiving, one cannot achieve others, how can one achieve oneself? Therefore, Confucius had the attitude of "learning without being satisfied" and "reviewing the old to know the new" to educate himself, and he could express the enthusiasm and interest of "teaching without discrimination," "teaching tirelessly," and "patiently guiding."

Confucius' unique views on the attitude towards life, although more than two thousand years have passed, are still correct and unchangeable. Their philosophical and educational value has not changed in the slightest, and they are worthy of admiration for hundreds of generations and deep study for all ages. Therefore, the government stipulates Confucius' birthday as Teachers' Day, which is to regard all teachers in the country as incarnations of Confucius and entrust the responsibility of realizing Confucius' advocacy entirely to teachers, and its significance is extremely important. As we hold the commemoration of Teachers' Day today, it seems that we are not only seeking solutions to issues such as teachers' status, treatment, and further education, but also in being able to understand Confucius' philosophy of life in order to seek changes in temperament. In other words, it is what is called "changing life." We believe that in today's world where people's hearts are treacherous and human desires are rampant, if we want to use the power of education to save the difficult times and revive people's hearts, we must first have the ambition to "take the world as our responsibility"; secondly, we must have the attitude of "choosing good and adhering to it," so that we can be successful everywhere.

Confucius traveled around the states, not afraid of hardship, although motivated by the compassion for the world, but its key lies in the ambition of "taking the world as one's own responsibility" to show the world. Zheng Shengmiao once asked Confucius: "Why are you so restless? Are you not trying to be flattering?" Confucius said: "I dare not be flattering, I hate stubbornness." Confucius' restlessness was aimed at saving the world and bringing peace to the people. For example, Chang Ju and Jie Ni said to Zi Lu: "The world is in a torrent, and who can change it?" Confucius replied: "One cannot live with birds and beasts. If I am not a follower of the people, who am I with?" The pessimistic nihilists see the world when the Way prevails, and hide when the Way does not prevail. They only grab the easy way, eat ready-made meals, and they are unwilling to manage the work of transforming society, so the evil society where "benevolence and righteousness are filled, leading beasts to eat people, and people will eat each other" is ignored by them, and they leave, living with wood and stone, playing with deer and pigs, and they congratulate themselves on their purity. Confucius, on the other hand, could not bear it in his heart, and would never lightly shirk his responsibility for his own ease. We must learn this spirit of "exhausting oneself," work hard to promote education, and never slack off, only using words like "difficult" and "thorny" to shirk responsibility, or using the beautiful name of "high-mindedness and far-sightedness" to cover up mistakes. We must recognize that education is for all, and if one person in society has not been educated and influenced, it is always our responsibility that has not been fulfilled and our ambition has not been achieved.

Confucius had the great ambition of saving the world and bringing peace to the people. He ran around all his life, endured hardships, and was trapped in Chen and Cai, and was ridiculed in Zheng and Wei. Although his way was ultimately not practiced, his attitude of "teaching goodness and adhering to it" and his spirit of "knowing that it cannot be done and doing it" are truly great. Confucius firmly believed that justice would ultimately prevail, and he said with certainty: "Heaven gave me virtue, what can Huan Tui do to me!" This inviolable spirit is enough to overcome all difficulties, regardless of harvest, but only engage in cultivation. As Zi Lu said: "A gentleman serves in order to practice his righteousness. If the Way is not practiced, I know it;" Dong Zhongshu said: "Correct his righteousness without seeking his benefit, and clarify his path without calculating his merit." Today, there are many people in China's education circle who have a solid foundation in learning and a lofty ambition, but they are also inevitably limited by the general utilitarian view, holding a pessimistic view of education, worshiping the superficial in their work, and often feeling sacrificed without reward, and even being eager to approach things that are beneficial to themselves, and avoiding things that are harmful to themselves. Of course, it is not right to make scattered efforts without a goal, or to bend oneself to please others and vainly hope to achieve something, but it is also not the attitude that teachers should have to stubbornly adhere to the view of protecting oneself and avoiding responsibility and neglecting one's duties.

The most systematic explanation of Confucius' philosophy is the book "The Great Learning." The Great Learning begins by proposing three major principles: "The way of the Great Learning lies in illuminating illustrious virtue, in renewing the people, and in resting in the highest good." The so-called "in illuminating illustrious virtue" means not to let the virtue that is born be drowned out, and to know how to temper it, magnify it, and it can be said that it is to determine our outlook on life. The so-called "in renewing the people" means to awaken the people, educate the people, and make the lives of the people improve. The so-called "in resting in the highest good" means that one must make all the actions of oneself and others reach the best extreme. In today's words, we are living in this difficult era, and only with a deep understanding of life can we truly understand the value of education. We must be driven by the psychology of "the benevolent loves others" and shoulder the mission of building the country through education. Only in this way can we talk about the power of education, and only in this way can we live up to the enthusiastic commemoration of Teachers' Day today!

### Investigation of the July 5th Incident Completed; Supervisory Yuan Presents Impeachment, Believing that Chen Jicheng, Zhao Changyan, and Bai Shiwei's Measures Were Inappropriate

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 26th Dispatch] Supervisory Committee members Gu Weixiang and Hu Wenhui were previously dispatched on the 3rd of this month to fly to Beiping to investigate the truth of the July 5th Incident. They completed their investigation on the 20th. In addition to collecting relevant information in Beiping, the two members also questioned relevant personnel on the scene, interviewed Chinese and foreigners in Dongjiaominxiang at the time, and went to the scene for investigation. Based on the results obtained, they prepared a report, which is over 4,000 words long. It is divided into two parts: "Causes of the Incident and the Course of Events" and "Analysis of the July 5th Incident." At the same time, they presented an impeachment against Chen Jicheng, commander of the Beiping Garrison, Zhao Changyan, battalion commander of the search battalion of the 208th Division of the Youth Army, and Bai Shiwei, deputy director of the Beiping Municipal Police Bureau, for their inappropriate measures. The report and the impeachment were submitted to the Control Yuan by Hu Wenhui when he returned to Beijing on the 23rd. The Control Yuan has already announced the impeachment case today, which has also been established by the review of the Control Committee members Tang Honglie, Jin Yueke, and Chen Yushan. On the 25th, the Control Yuan sent it to the Executive Yuan. The impeachment is divided into three parts for Chen Jicheng, Zhao Changyan, and Bai Shiwei: (1) The part for Chen Jicheng briefly states: When the students petitioned and marched on July 5th, Chen Jicheng did not follow Commander-in-Chief Fu's instructions to order his subordinates not to carry guns and not to hit students. Moreover, the 208th Division is a field force, and using it to suppress students would inevitably lead to incidents. Furthermore, the 208th Division and Beiping students have a poor relationship, and Chen Jicheng failed to consider this when handling the matter. Although it was out of line and violated discipline for the students to destroy the Senate, Chen Jicheng failed to personally and properly guard the scene when the students confronted the military police all day, and ordered Bai Shiwei, a police officer, to command the military police and gendarmerie, and he was unable to properly restrain his subordinates, which ultimately led to the tragic incident in front of Xu Huidong's residence where students were shot and killed by soldiers of the 208th Division. Chen Jicheng cannot but bear the responsibility for inappropriate measures and dereliction of duty. (2) The part for Zhao Changyan briefly states: When the students petitioned in front of Xu Huidong's residence on the afternoon of July 5th and were unable to meet Xu Huidong, Zhao Changyan was ordered to lead his troops to the scene for guard, and Deputy Director of the Police Bureau Bai Shiwei was appointed as the commander. Zhao Changyan failed to obey Bai Shiwei's orders and allowed his subordinates to take combat measures. He also failed to immediately stop the soldiers from firing, which led to the tragedy. Zhao Changyan should be held responsible for allowing his subordinates to kill people and handed over to the military law court for trial. (3) The part for Bai Shiwei briefly states: Bai Shiwei, as the deputy director of the police bureau, was ordered to be the commander, but he failed to properly coordinate with the military police and gendarmerie. When he saw that the troops' deployment was serious, he should have restrained his subordinates and accepted the students' conditions for disposal. Later, he also failed to timely notify the troops that the students were about to disperse and return, which led to the tragedy due to misunderstanding. Bai Shiwei is not without negligence in handling the matter, incompetence in commanding, and dereliction of duty.

### Guangdong Prevents Capital Flight to Hong Kong; Sends Large Number of Military Police to Monitor Gold and Currency Transactions in the Market; Song Ziwen Will Go to Hong Kong to Discuss the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 26th Dispatch] The Guangdong authorities have strictly prevented capital from fleeing to Hong Kong. They have now dispatched a large number of military police to extensively monitor the gold, currency, and Hong Kong dollar transactions in the Guangzhou market, and the connection is gradually shrinking. The scope of circulation of the Hong Kong dollar in Guangdong and designated banks is limited as much as possible to exchange Hong Kong dollars with gold yuan. At present, a large number of Hong Kong dollars have been absorbed, and there is absolute certainty. Strict surveillance will be carried out at the key points of the Sino-Hong Kong water and land transportation to prevent merchants and travelers from carrying Hong Kong dollars into the country. Gold yuan are also not allowed to be carried to Hong Kong. According to news from related parties: Chairman Song Ziwen will go to Hong Kong within the week to discuss the Sino-Hong Kong agreement. Mr. Qian Shihe, the person in charge of Hong Kong Customs, suddenly flew to Shanghai on the 24th. It is widely believed that his trip to Shanghai is related to the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong agreement.

### Gold Yuan Appears in Hong Kong; Overseas Remittances at National Banks Active

[Central News Agency Hong Kong, 26th Dispatch] The gold yuan appeared for the first time in the local money market today, which aroused considerable interest and curiosity among the local residents. Local banks and money shops are engaged in the exchange of new currency. The reporter learned from the banks today that since the banks announced the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar and the gold yuan, the overseas remittances of our national banks in the area have become active. It only costs one Hong Kong dollar to remit 100 gold yuan. Due to the rapid exchange and low fees, the various national banks in the area have a great potential to immediately acquire all the overseas remittances that were previously monopolized by local banks.

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 26th Dispatch] The enthusiasm for the exchange of new currency after its issuance is enough to show the credit and support of the new currency. However, in recent days, there are still a small number of speculators who take advantage of the fact that the new subsidiary coins have not yet arrived to privately trade foreign currencies for profit. The police bureau has dispatched a large number of police officers to monitor for days. Yesterday, more than a dozen people were arrested in the Thirteen Hongs financial market. The Thirteen Hongs has become desolate and no longer has its former prosperity.

### Merchants and Citizens Raising Prices Sent to Special Criminal Court; Prices in the Capital Stabilizing; Vegetable Prices Generally Decreased After Market Control

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] According to information from the Social Affairs Bureau of Nanjing: The market reaction in Nanjing after the issuance of the Gold Yuan was that prices only fluctuated slightly in the first one or two days, and by the 20th, they had entered a stable state. The Yuan's agencies strictly supervised and enforced the central government's orders without any leniency. All merchants and citizens who violated the regulations were dealt with according to the law. As of noon on the 26th, there were 25 cases of price gouging that were investigated by the police and sent to the bureau. Twelve merchants whose cases were more serious were immediately transferred to the Special Tribunal for legal processing. Merchants and citizens were deeply aware of the government's determination to implement this major policy and became vigilant, no longer harboring any speculative intentions. As a result, the market quickly stabilized, with prices frozen at the level of August 19th for many days, and many automatically lowered their prices, such as for daily necessities like rice, flour, oil, salt, sugar, and cloth. Regarding the prices of small vegetable markets, which are most easily affected by fluctuations during any country's currency reform, there was a slight occurrence of this in Nanjing in the past two or three days. However, starting on the morning of the 26th, the City Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Department formed several inspection teams to directly control the vegetable markets. The general price of vegetables immediately and universally decreased within one or two hours. Pork was 54 cents, eggs were 4.5 cents, bean sprouts were 7 cents, and green vegetables were 5 to 8 cents, with normal supply. This proves that the situation in Nanjing's vegetable markets has become favorable.

### Chengdu and Kunming Use Old Nickel Coins; Market Suddenly Plunges into Chaos

[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 26th] The Chengdu Municipal Government announced on the 26th that old nickel coins would be in general circulation, and the market suddenly plunged into unprecedented chaos. Most of the city's shops closed and suspended business, and retail prices soared by 100%. The reason is that nickel coins were mostly used in Chengdu during the war and have long been regarded as waste. Many who hoarded them suddenly became rich overnight and rushed to buy goods, causing chaos. The Municipal Government is handling the situation urgently.

Also, Chengdu began to forcibly implement price controls on the 26th. The Provincial Government specially stipulated the prices of 24 types of daily necessities in six categories, which were monitored by the police, and violators were sent to the Special Criminal Court.

[Our Kunming Dispatch, 26th] After the Central Bank announced that nickel coins would continue to be used as before, the Kunming market was extremely chaotic. The value of silver rose sharply, and there was a rush to buy yarn, cloth, and general merchandise. Rice prices soared, and the common people felt particularly uneasy.

### Berlin Communists Demonstrate and Riot; Break into City Hall; Sing "The Internationale" and Shout "Anti-American" Slogans; Openly Demand Overthrow of Elected City Government

[United Press Berlin, 26th] Communist demonstrators and rioters broke down the doors of Berlin City Hall at 2:10 PM (Berlin time) on the 26th and stormed into the city hall building, intending to overthrow the democratically elected non-Communist city government.

[United Press Berlin, 26th] The Berlin City Council canceled its meeting on the afternoon of the 26th after the Communists openly declared their intention to overthrow the elected city government and concentrated in various districts of the city. The City Council was originally scheduled to meet at the city hall in the Soviet zone at 2:00 PM, but before noon, the concentrated Communists had already set off for the city hall. The City Council's Council of Elders then voted at noon to cancel the meeting. At the intersection of Anhalter Straße on the border between the American and Soviet zones, American police almost clashed with 150 Communist rioters. All police in the Western sector were ordered to be on alert on the morning of the 26th, as the intentions of the Communists had become clear. Therefore, when the situation in Anhalter Straße became tense, ten police squads were dispatched to provide reinforcements. The crowd held Communist flags, sang the Internationale, and shouted: "American capitalists, get out! This is not America, it is a Soviet area. You bombed our houses, killed our women and children, and now you don't give us food to eat. Get out!" The demonstrators gathered in the Soviet zone's Lustgarten Park in the morning. Although the Western Occupation Forces dispatched all their monitors, they still could not protect the city hall, as it was located in the "neutral area" designated by the four powers within the Soviet zone. According to the chief of police, they were ordered to repel the rioters if they invaded the American zone. Lieutenant Colonel Keightley said that unless specifically ordered by senior American authorities, American MPs would not be dispatched to the border. The city council agenda included four highly explosive proposals, any of which could be used by the Communists as a pretext to overthrow the elected government. An American newspaper stated that "if the Communists attempt to seize the government through large-scale demonstrations, they will receive retribution and reap what they sow."

[United Press Berlin, 26th] The democratically elected city government of Berlin seemed on the verge of collapse on the 26th due to harassment and attacks by Communist demonstrators. Supported by a large number of action committee members, party workers, factory workers, and pro-Soviet figures, the Communists held their own city council meeting. It is generally believed that this is the first wave of Soviet efforts to establish its own Berlin government. The three major non-Communist parties immediately called on their members to hold a mass protest rally at 3:00 PM to counter the Communist offensive against the government. The rally was held in Republic Square in front of the former German Reichstag building, a stone's throw from the Soviet zone. The German Communist Party's pseudo-city council in Berlin established a ten-member committee and passed a request to be submitted to Acting Mayor Ferdinandsberg, including "a unified city government under Communist control."

[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 26th] Well-informed people here are quite fearful of this major Communist demonstration in Berlin, believing that this move may lead to the Communists demanding power in the Berlin city government. Communist leader Pieck declared at a party meeting this morning, "We are fighting for national and socialist goals, and the Soviet occupation authorities will support us. Our struggle in Berlin is to guarantee Berlin's monetary and supply unification."

[Report from this Newspaper] London, 26th, Radio Moscow: Western powers' envoys have received new instructions from their respective governments, preparing to participate in the next Kremlin meeting, and are waiting for news from the Kremlin. It is generally expected that the next meeting will take place on the night of the 26th, but the 27th seems more likely. Western envoys have clarified some doubts that arose after the meeting with Stalin on Monday night, and are now in complete agreement on the attitude to be taken in the next meeting.

[United Press Berlin, 26th] It is reported that the Western countries have agreed to the Soviet Union's currency demands, but with one caveat: that the Soviet mark in Berlin should be controlled by the four powers. According to authoritative sources here, the Western countries have suggested to Stalin that the Berlin currency issue and other minor issues be handed over to the Berlin Four-Power Command for handling. The Soviet Union has not yet responded, but it is expected that the Soviet Union is "very likely to accept."

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 25th] Diplomatic circles here point out that the key issues in the current Moscow meeting are: (1) Whether Germany's future political system should be divided or unified; (2) Whether communist ideology should be allowed to spread back to Western Europe, reaching the French border, or should be confined to its current territory. The Anglo-Soviet talks began at the end of July and are still in the first stage, the purpose of which is to discuss how to convene a four-power foreign ministers' meeting to decide on Germany's final political system. One of the basic conditions of the negotiations is how to reach an agreement on the German monetary system. In addition, Stalin demanded that the reorganization of the West German states and the establishment of a West German government by the Western powers, as stipulated in the London Agreement, should be suspended when the four-power foreign ministers' meeting is reopened, because the Soviet Union believes that the newly established West German government is a military base that will eventually become a springboard for attacking the Soviet Union. For the Western Allies, there is currently no problem in suspending the organization of the West German government, as the future foreign ministers' meeting will discuss the entire German political system. However, if a unified German government is established, even if it is a federal government, Berlin must be the capital.

### Mrs. Kasenkina Dissatisfied with the Soviet Regime; Complains to Reporters that She Jumped Out of a Window to Escape the Soviet Consulate

[United Press New York, 25th] Mrs. Kasenkina gave her first interview to the press on the 25th since her dramatic window jump from the Soviet consulate. She was quite tired as she answered questions from her hospital bed at Roosevelt Hospital, breathing heavily with beads of sweat on her brow.

[United States Information Service New York, 25th] Russian émigré teacher Mrs. Kasenkina stated to the press today that she jumped from the fourth floor of the Soviet Consulate to avoid being sent back to the Soviet Union. She declared, "I did not intend to commit suicide, I only wanted to escape." She is currently being treated for her injuries at Roosevelt Hospital, and three reporters went to interview her.

Mrs. Kasenkina's account of what happened is completely different from that of Soviet Consul General Lomakin. She said that she went to the Tolstoy Foundation farm of her own volition, while Lomakin claimed that he "rescued" her. She said, "When Lomakin and his group sent me back to the consulate, I knew that if they did not allow me to leave, then I would not be able to escape after going to Moscow. Therefore, I jumped out of the window, intending to escape." When reporters asked when she decided that she did not want to return to the Soviet Union, she said, "When I was still in Russia, I felt that if I could reach America, then I would not have to return to Russia. The reason why I wanted to escape was because in 1937, they took my husband away, and I don't know where he is. He has disappeared." She also said that her son died in the Battle of Leningrad in 1942. She said, "My son is a student, and my husband and I are both teachers." Some asked Mrs. Kasenkina about one point, namely what Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin discussed with her at the consulate after Lomakin took her away from the Tolstoy Foundation farm. She said, "I thought that the people in the consulate seemed to have a kind heart on the surface and were willing to talk to me, but he (Panyushkin) said that he didn't bother to talk to me, but I would go downstairs to meet the reporters. Panyushkin and Lomakin both told me what to say to the reporters, and told me that through this interview, I would become a heroine. This was on August 7th, the day Lomakin announced that he had 'rescued' her from the kidnappers from the 'White Russian Guards.'" Mrs. Kasenkina remained in the consulate until the day she jumped out of the window on August 12th. She made it clear that she wanted to leave the consulate and terminate her affiliation with the school for the children of Soviet diplomats at the United Nations. She said that she had told the Consul General that during the two years she had lived in the United States, she had become increasingly dissatisfied with the lives of Soviet citizens. She said, "I love my people and our homeland, but I cannot agree with the Soviet regime." During the twenty minutes that Mrs. Kasenkina was interviewed by the press, one lawyer, two doctors, and one New York City police officer were present as witnesses. At the same time, there were several newsreel cameramen and a Russian translator. Mrs. Kasenkina appeared exhausted, but at the end of the interview, she repeatedly expressed her gratitude to the reporters, New York police, and hospital staff.

### Two Powers Compete for Vacuum; War Crisis Lurks; Dulles Discusses World Problems

[United Press Amsterdam, 25th] Republican foreign policy planner John Foster Dulles told a press conference on the 25th that the current world crisis stems from the competition of existing powers to fill the vacuum created by the destruction or weakening of the six major powers in World War II. Dulles was unwilling to predict the possibility of war, only reiterating what he had said at the secret meeting of the International Affairs Committee of the World Council of Churches. He said that the destruction of Germany, Italy, and Japan, which are no longer world powers, and the weakening of China, Britain, and France have created a vacuum, and the process of filling this vacuum is a "competition and pressure." The question now is how this can proceed peacefully. Dulles spoke of the "moral vacuum" today, saying that "I believe the main task of the General Assembly is to create moral and spiritual strength." The current task is to buy time to work out a long-term plan to maintain world order. He hopes that the General Assembly will guide Christians everywhere, including in the Soviet Union.

It is also expected that Kim Il-sung will be elected as the first president of the new government. In his election speech, Kim Il-sung referred to South Korean President Syngman Rhee, who is supported by the United States, as a traitor. Kim pointed out that while he and the Korean people actively participated in the anti-Japanese struggle, Syngman Rhee lived a comfortable life in the United States.

### Subsidiary Coins Supplied by National Bank; Businesses Prohibited from Issuing Substitute Coupons

Since the issuance of Gold Yuan Certificates, there has been a very enthusiastic response from various parties requesting to exchange Legal Tender, gold, silver, and foreign currencies. Therefore, they are already generally circulating in the market. However, there is still a lack of subsidiary currency certificates. It is learned that the Central Bank, in order to meet social needs, has already prepared a large number of subsidiary currency certificates for exchange. If banks, money shops, and people from the industrial and commercial sectors have needs, they can directly apply to the Business and Issuance Bureaus of the Central Bank for exchange. However, fractional currency has not yet arrived in large quantities. Various parties can still use 30,000 Legal Tender to offset one fen when making change. It has been rumored that some businesses and companies have arbitrarily issued substitute coupons, which is a sign of contempt for the law and a disruption of the currency system. Once verified, the relevant authorities will severely punish them according to the law in order to prevent currency outflow.

### Unified Economic Inspection Work Under the Command of Chiang Ching-kuo; To Be Generally Implemented Starting Today; Illegal Businesses Will Have Licenses Revoked and Be Dealt with According to the Law; Market Idle Funds Will Be Diverted

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chiang Ching-kuo, Deputy Supervisor of Economic Control in the Shanghai area, held an emergency meeting at the Central Bank yesterday morning. Those attending included Yu Shuping, Lin Chongyong, Zhang Yongnian, etc. It was resolved that in order to stabilize prices, all units under military, police, and economic control will jointly conduct a comprehensive inspection of all warehouses and markets starting today, and closely monitor major land and water transportation routes to strictly prohibit the unauthorized movement of materials. In order to strengthen the efficiency of inspections, it was decided that: (1) the inspection agencies will be unified. From now on, inspection work will be directed and uniformly implemented by Chiang Ching-kuo, and no longer conducted individually by various military and police agencies. It is believed that after the inspection agencies are unified, they can exert full force, but with the principle of not disturbing the people. (2) All merchants in the city who abide by national laws and do not hoard or manipulate the market will be guaranteed by law. (3) All businesses that violate national laws and various provisions of emergency economic measures will have their licenses revoked, and the persons in charge will be sent to the Special Criminal Court for legal action, and the goods will be confiscated. The above resolution will be generally implemented starting today. Chiang also stated that although market idle funds have increased due to the government's redemption of gold, silver, and foreign currencies, the government will divert them by issuing Gold Yuan public bonds and other methods to ensure that they do not affect price stability. The government will also control materials in production areas and make comprehensive adjustments based on the needs of various regions. Therefore, although strict price limits have reduced market transactions, there is no risk of a shortage of supplies in cities.

### Cruel and Unusual: Robbery and Murder; Thief Li Renjin Sentenced to Death; Estranged Wife Weeps Upon Hearing the Verdict

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Special Criminal Court sentenced a thief, Li Renjin, to death yesterday for robbery and murder. Li's wife, Wang Sanmei, was also in court. Although the couple had separated, she couldn't help but cry when she heard the verdict, and her face changed drastically. Li was from Haizhou, 29 years old, and did not engage in proper work. After coming to Shanghai this year, he often quarreled with his wife, Wang Sanmei, so he stayed with his sister-in-law, Xu Xiaomei, at No. 16, Lane 297, Guangxi Road, working as a shoe shiner. However, his income was meager and insufficient to maintain his livelihood. Seeing that the occupants of the back room, Lai Guoqing and his wife Lai Zhangyinji, were dressed fashionably, he became malicious. On the 7th of last month, he first stole a small sharp knife for peeling water chestnuts from a stall vendor on Yunnan Road and hid it on his body, intending to wait for an opportunity to strike. At 6 a.m. on the 8th, while the Lai couple was fast asleep, Li secretly took the sharp knife and climbed into Lai's bedroom through the window, intending to steal the watch Lai was wearing on his wrist. Lai suddenly woke up and shouted loudly, and his wife also got up to resist, hugging the defendant. Li then stabbed the Lai couple wildly with the sharp knife, resulting in Lai being stabbed three times and his wife being stabbed seven times, all in vital areas such as the chest and abdomen. Li was then able to struggle and escape. At that time, Lai chased him to the door, but due to the severity of his injuries, he was unable to run any further. After returning to the room, he was sent to Renji Hospital, where he died. Lai's wife was four months pregnant, and the fetus in her womb was also tragically killed. After being admitted to the hospital, the dead fetus was removed by the hospital, but she herself is likely to be disabled. After committing the crime, Li knew that he could not stay safely in Shanghai, so he fled to Changshu. After being introduced, he was sold as a strong laborer, replacing someone in the Third Battalion, Ninth Company, First Platoon of the Jiangsu Security Regiment as a private first class. However, the Municipal Police局 obtained clues after the incident and arrested him in Zhitang Town, Changshu. He was transferred to the Special Criminal Court for trial on the charge of robbery and murder. In court yesterday, it was stated that although Li did not succeed in his robbery, his cruelty and ruthlessness were extraordinary and unforgivable. Therefore, he was convicted of "robbery and intentional homicide, sentenced to death, and deprived of political rights for life." Finally, the court instructed the defendant that if he disagreed with this verdict, he could file an application for retrial within ten days of receiving the judgment.

He also confessed that at around 10:30 p.m. on the 24th, he had robbed a woman named Wu Juying of a gold ring on Tushan Se Pu West Road. As for the firearm he possessed, it belonged to his uncle, Song Yaogang. During the enemy and puppet period, Song had worked in the Puppet Transportation Unit, and the gun was left over from his time in that unit.

### Arson and Destruction of Pawnshop Case: Lu Zimei Sentenced to Life Imprisonment; Leniency Granted for Repentance and Surrender After the Crime

[Our Newspaper] Lu Zimei, a clerk at the Qiaoxing Pawnshop on Fuxing Middle Road in this city, demanded an increase in severance pay from his employer without success. Out of resentment, he set fire to the pawnshop, resulting in the deaths of five people, including the assistant manager, Gao Jianqing. The District Court yesterday sentenced the defendant Lu Zimei to life imprisonment for arson and murder, with permanent deprivation of civil rights. The reasons: (1) Although the deaths of the victims were caused by the defendant's act of arson, the defendant did not intend to kill them, and is only liable for negligent homicide according to law. (2) Even if the defendant did not intentionally cause the death of the victims, it was not contrary to the defendant's original intention. This kind of uncertain intention of consequence belongs to indirect intent under Article 12, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. (3) The killing of five people constitutes multiple crimes committed by one act. (4) The defendant voluntarily surrendered to the authorities and showed remorse after the crime, and leniency was granted in the sentencing.

### Figures for the Exchange of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currencies Break Past Records Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] The total value of gold, silver, and banknotes exchanged yesterday reached 10,231,304.57 gold yuan, breaking the previous day's record by a difference of 15,000 gold yuan. This included 32,585.546 taels of gold, 787,498.28 US dollars, 25,116.990 taels of silver, 86,263 silver dollars, and 421,767.05 Hong Kong dollars. Compared to the second day, the number of US dollars received decreased slightly, but there was a significant increase in gold and silver dollars. Today is Confucius' birthday, and financial institutions are closed for the holiday, so exchange activities will also be suspended for one day.

Regarding the method of inspecting the fineness of gold in this exchange, gold is rubbed on a "touchstone," and specialized personnel with experience in identifying gold fineness visually assess the gold content on the stone. This is then confirmed with a "gold comparison card." The procedure is extremely thorough. After the gold fineness is determined, a "gold and silver slip" is issued to the exchanger, stating "exchange weight in market taels," "fineness," "pure gold content," "exchange rate," and "equivalent gold yuan." If the exchanger disagrees with the determined fineness, they can still withdraw the original gold for re-inspection based on the original slip to clarify the truth.

### Theater Ticket Prices Agreed Upon; First-Run Theaters Set to Decrease

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Chinese and Western Film Theaters held a meeting at the Film Industry Association yesterday afternoon to discuss the revision of ticket prices after the currency reform. The resulting proposed ticket prices are as follows: First-run theaters: minimum 4 jiao gold yuan, followed by 8 jiao, 1 yuan 2 jiao, and a maximum of 1 yuan 6 jiao. Second-run theaters: minimum 2 jiao gold yuan, followed by 4 jiao, 6 jiao, and a maximum of 8 jiao. Third-run theaters: 1 jiao 5 fen, 2 jiao 5 fen, and 4 jiao. In addition to changing the ticket prices to gold yuan, adjustments will also be made to the tier of each theater. Due to the special circumstances after the war, some theaters that were originally second or third-run theaters joined the ranks of first-run theaters simply by obtaining the premiere rights to films. However, with repeated increases in ticket prices, they have found it difficult to maintain operations due to declining business. These theaters will voluntarily withdraw from the first run, and the Film Industry Association will also review the equipment and location of each theater. It is therefore expected that the number of first-run theaters will decrease significantly. These adjustments to ticket prices and tiers are still subject to procedural formalities and reporting to the Bureau of Social Affairs and are expected to be implemented starting next week.

### Police Chief Issues Orders: Strictly Enforce Laws and Regulations

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Police Bureau, under Yu Shuping, yesterday issued an order stating: "The success or failure of economic control policies is related to the fate of the nation and the people. Police officers of this bureau should concentrate all their efforts and work together to achieve success. In addition to explaining the recently issued economic control laws and regulations of the central government in detail to their subordinates and supervising their implementation, the heads of each unit must also promptly report and investigate illegal activities related to black market trading in gold and banknotes and the hoarding of materials for speculation, in order to impose sanctions. All levels of police officers must take this as their most urgent and central task at present and must not slacken in the slightest, lest they be severely investigated."

Although today is a holiday, the police economic patrol brigade has been ordered to patrol various commercial markets and randomly inspect the retail prices of companies and stores.

### Air Freight Rates for Goods, Mail, and Newspapers Ordered to be Reduced

[Our Newspaper] China and Central Aviation Companies yesterday received a telegram from the Ministry of Communications ordering that, in order to cooperate with the emergency economic measures and assist the government in stabilizing prices, the 85% increase in freight rates approved for the two companies from the 20th of this month for mail, newspapers, and ordinary goods carried by flights should be reduced from today (the 27th), restoring the original prices before the 20th. Because mail is used by the vast majority of the public, newspapers are related to the circulation of national culture, and ordinary goods are closely related to regulating materials in various regions and stabilizing prices, these must all be given reductions. As for passenger tickets and the freight rates for valuable items, the increase will be maintained. This wise measure by the Ministry of Communications, at a time when national economic reforms are being implemented, is a pioneer in leading price reductions by public utilities and transportation services. However, the two airlines, whose financial revenues and expenditures are already unbalanced, have been ordered by the Ministry

### Labor-Management Appraisal Committee Passes: Standards for Calculating Employee Wages; Calculated According to the Discounted Base Salary Based on This Month's Index; Salaries Paid Twice a Month

[Our Newspaper] The 21st meeting of the Shanghai Labor-Management Appraisal Committee was held at the Bureau of Social Affairs meeting room yesterday afternoon.

The main topic of discussion at yesterday's meeting was how to calculate the gold yuan equivalent of wages after the currency reform. The committee members debated fiercely, and as a result, the "Standards for Calculating the Gold Yuan Equivalent of Employee Wages in Various Industries in Shanghai in August" were passed. The standards are divided into four items:

(1) The salaries of employees in various industries shall be calculated based on their original discounted base salary, with reference to the upper period living index for August as the highest standard, to determine the gold yuan equivalent of the earned legal tender discount. If there is a dispute, it shall be reviewed and handled by the Bureau of Social Affairs.

(2) Workers' wages should be based on a monthly, daily, or piece-rate standard. Overtime pay and income from processing shall not be converted into wages.

(3) If there are other subsidies agreed upon by various industries, they shall still follow the agreement, but they shall not be converted into wages.

(4) Salaries shall be paid twice a month, in mid-month and at the end of the month, with the interval not exceeding five days. Those with established customs shall continue to follow their customs.

In addition, mobile odd-job workers in the water and electricity installation industry requested the Labor-Management Appraisal Committee to abolish the method of progressive discounts on base salaries. This was rejected by the Committee yesterday: It was handled according to the decision of the 13th meeting of the Committee. (That is, the application was rejected.)

### Does the Regulation to Stabilize Prices Include Rent? Land Administration Bureau Concludes in Forum that a Request Should be Made to the Central Government

[Our Newspaper] The standard for rent in this city has been calculated at 9,000 times the base rent for commercial housing and 7,000 times for residential housing, as approved by the City Council in March of this year. Adjustments were to be made after six months, which is now the adjustment period, and it also coincides with the currency reform. In order to solicit opinions from all parties to facilitate the formulation of new rent standards, the Land Administration Bureau convened a forum yesterday morning. Those present included Xu Jiguang, the Deputy Speaker of the City Council; Wu Yunxu from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Li Ming from the Bankers Association; Xu Fuji from the District Court; Ye Xiangao from the General Labor Union; Mei Hao from the Tenants Union; Yu Zhongluo from the Lawyers Association; Yu Chuanzhao from the Education Association; as well as councilors Lu Shi, Zhou Xuexiang, Ma Junshuo, Zhu Fuqiu, Wu Zhengjue, and Jiang Pingfan, totaling more than 40 people. Director Zhu, the chairman, reported that the current period for revising the rent standards in this city has arrived, which coincides with the currency reform. He requested that opinions be expressed to serve as a reference. Representatives then gave speeches and reviewed the rent problem in detail. The consensus was that it should be requested from the central government whether the emergency measures to stabilize prices under the economic reforms include rent, and that information should be collected from all relevant parties to prepare for further discussions. The meeting adjourned at around 1:00 PM.

### Madame Chiang Kai-shek's Wide-Ranging Talk: Entertaining Reporters in "Children's Paradise," Discussing Kuling Construction and Currency Reform

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Liu Tongqu

[Special Dispatch from Kuling to This Newspaper, 24th] Kuling has been shrouded in continuous rain and thick fog. The weather turned bad the day after the President went down the mountain, and it lasted for six consecutive days. On the afternoon of the 24th, the rain stopped, the fog dissipated, and the clouds floated in the sky with the sun appearing and disappearing intermittently. People suffocated by the fog finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Rainy days make Kuling boring. News reporters had no one to interview, so they racked their brains for ideas. First, they asked Wang Zuomin, the director of the Administration Bureau, to tell Madame President if she could find time to entertain the reporters for a casual chat, but nothing came of it. At noon on the 24th, a jointly signed request letter was sent to the official residence.

On the street, reporters were wandering around, looking for interview subjects. Madame Chiang strolled over, with her secretary and attendants following behind. Upon encountering the group of reporters, Madame Chiang immediately thought of the case and said to Wang Zuomin, "How about inviting them to visit the Children's Paradise together and chat for a while?"

This turned into an unexpected opportunity. A simple press conference was held in the Children's Paradise—this was the first time Madame President had entertained reporters.

Madame Loves Orphan Girls, Witty Remarks Elicit Laughter

Fourteen orphaned girls, raised by Director Hu, have grown up and received special love from Madame President. Madame Chiang herself said that every time she comes to Kuling, she either invites them to the official residence to play or comes to see them. This year, she came in person, donated five shi (approximately 500 kg) of rice, brought many snacks, had them sing a song, and then personally distributed fruit and cakes to them. During this break, Madame Chiang met with the group of reporters.

Without taking off her coat and headscarf, Madame Chiang sat calmly on a wicker chair in the corner, facing the group of reporters: "What do you want to ask?" The conversation started from the orphans. Madame Chiang said, "They are all girls abandoned by their parents, which shows that society values men over women." A reporter immediately chimed in, "They have received Madame's care, but isn't that favoring women over men?" A burst of laughter erupted.

Talking about her stay in Kuling, Madame Chiang said she had rarely been out due to the continuous rain and fog. She said, "I am preparing to go down the mountain." "Is the President not coming?" "He is too busy, I am afraid he cannot come." The official residence on Huangpu Road in Nanjing is still under renovation. Madame Chiang said, "After returning to Nanjing, I am afraid I will still live in the Song Mansion in Beijige." A reporter asked, "What is Madame's impression of Kuling's construction?" "It seems that the streets are very clean. Construction requires everyone's help; relying on one director is not enough, especially you news reporters, who should provide more assistance."

The children sitting on the floor eating fruit and cake were looking at this strange group of guests. Madame Chiang turned around and said, "How about singing a song for the guests?" So Director Hu played the organ, and they sang a song together. Madame Chiang personally handed the cake plate to the oldest child and asked her to take everyone out to play.

Not Fully Supporting the New Currency Will Only Cause Suffering for the People; The reception continued, but the questions turned serious. A reporter asked, "After the currency reform, if the economy stabilizes and there are no military problems, do the President and Madame intend to travel abroad?" This question seemed to make Madame Chiang a little embarrassed. After hesitating slightly, she said, "I don't know. I cannot answer this question."

However, the issue of currency reform sparked Madame Chiang's opinion. She said, "Whether the economy will stabilize after the currency reform depends on whether the people have confidence and wholeheartedly support it." She pointed out that the eight-year war against Japan was finally won because the people of the whole country were united. "If the people have no confidence and do not fully support the new currency system, in the end, the people themselves will suffer."

Persuasion is Better Than Force; Encouraging Wealthy Households to Donate Quickly

Madame Chiang has many British and American friends and pays special attention to European and American public opinion. The reporters used this as a topic to ask Madame Chiang for her opinion. Madame Chiang said: "Democracy can tolerate criticism. However, democracy is not about transplanting foreign things to China. China has its own democracy." Regarding American aid, Madame Chiang believes that one cannot rely entirely on aid from friendly countries but must rely on self-reliance. A reporter raised the issue of "powerful family capital." Madame Chiang seemed a little excited and said, "Powerful family capital is a slogan shouted by the Communist Party." She believes that wealthy people should be made to take out money. The government can stipulate heavy taxes but cannot "extort." "What if they don't take it out without extortion?" Madame Chiang's view is: "People all have a conscience. Persuasion is better than force." She believes that as long as the persuasion is done properly, the wealthy can be moved to take out money. Then, from the women's movement to the peasant problem, Madame Chiang explained that the National Women's Movement Committee has never stopped working since the war of resistance, but it has done more practical work and less publicity. In the future, this deficiency should also be made up, and efforts should be put into publicity. The problem is that there are few funds. The Women's Movement Committee is also a social organization and has no fixed funds, so it is very difficult to do things. She advocates that all work should go to the countryside in the future. Since farmers contribute money and labor, their lives should be improved. Madame Chiang said that students, in particular, should go to the countryside.

Impression of Reporters; Believing They are the Pioneers of the Nation

The questions turned to the news reporters themselves. "What is Madame's impression of news reporters? Have reporters made progress since the war of resistance?"

"Very obvious," Madame Chiang said affirmatively. "If I didn't think you reporters were promising young people, I wouldn't have spent this time talking to you today." She said that she had also been a news reporter. She believes that news reporters are the pioneers of the nation. They must record accurately, pay attention to major events, and not pay too much attention to trivial matters. They should play a leading role in society, especially by setting an example and paying attention to their words and deeds.

The conversation lasted about forty minutes. Madame Chiang was always calm in her answers, kind and amiable, and her smile never left her lips, giving people a very friendly impression. She stood up amid the reporters' thanks, shook hands with each of them, and said goodbye.

On the way back, Madame Chiang still walked. Our photographer rushed over, and with a flash of light, Madame Chiang's smile was captured in the lens. Madame Chiang looked and realized it was a familiar photographer:

"You are still here..."

"I am with Shen Bao now."

"Shen Bao," Madame Chiang smiled and nodded. Dusk spread, and thick fog swooped down from the mountains again, all the way until Madame Chiang walked back to the official residence on Hedong Road.

[Dispatch from Wujin to This Newspaper, 25th] Xu Sanlin, a resident of Xingxian Lane, Juqian Street in the city, was a former secret agent. After the victory, he was idle and had fanciful ideas. He conspired with accomplices Wu Jinda, Zhu Yuzhen, Zhu Xiyu, and others to privately make counterfeit money. They made various preparations and pooled funds at 400 million per share to rent a machine and cast plates. The printing site was set up at the home of Zhu Jiji, father of Zhu Jiangzhen, in Zhujia Village, Daqiao Yi, Beixiang. Printing, sales, and material procurement were handled separately.

### Securities Brokers Association Holds Meeting; Decides to Stop Trading on Behalf of Customers; Hopes the Authorities Will Approve Resumption of Business Soon

[Report from This Newspaper] The Securities Brokers Association of this city held a temporary members' meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. A total of more than 190 member representatives attended. Chairman Wang Naixu presided over the meeting, which adjourned at 4:30 PM. Two resolutions were passed: (1) During the period when the securities exchange is ordered to suspend business, all brokers should stop trading on behalf of customers. Trading will resume after the securities exchange resumes business. (2) Request the securities exchange authorities to submit a report to the government authorities as soon as possible to resume the securities exchange business.

Wang Naixu, the chairman of the Brokers Association, told reporters after the meeting: "The brokers' own position has always been pure. Brokers have always strictly complied with the laws and regulations and assisted the government in promoting economic policies in previous economic measures. For example, during the last suspension of trading, brokers complied with the order and smoothly cleared all completed transactions. Before the securities exchange was ordered to suspend business this time, the brokers had an outstanding balance of 100 trillion yuan for various transactions, but they also smoothly cleared them. This shows that brokers have always cooperated with the government. Therefore, after the government issued the order to suspend the securities exchange this time, the association's position, in addition to requesting all brokers to temporarily stop trading on behalf of customers, still hopes that the government can resume the securities exchange business as soon as possible.

After the currency is stabilized, there should be appropriate guidance for the floating capital in the market so that it can be brought into the right track. After the securities exchange is suspended, the 213 brokers and the hundreds of thousands of people directly and indirectly related to the industry are greatly affected, and the general factories and companies cannot raise funds. It is believed that after the resumption of the securities exchange business, it will be able to build a bridge for the floating capital in the market and guide it towards the path of production."

### Prices Stable at Production Sites, Sales Sluggish; Rice Prices Hover at Low Levels; Oil Market's Ban on Exports Makes People Nervous

The rice market is sluggish because of sluggish sales. The weather is sunny, arrivals are continuous, and more new indica rice is entering the market. Prices are stable at the production sites, and importers are weak-willed. Sales are very slow. Initial prices are similar, but later there is a drop of two to five jiao. White japonica rice in the south enters below 19 yuan, and thin paddy rice leaves the station at 20 yuan. However, it turned firm slightly at the close. Thin paddy rice in the north market is even, special high japonica rice sales are weak, falling five jiao, and trading at 21 yuan. Today is Confucius's birthday, and the market is closed for one day. Yesterday's arrivals were 3,940 shi.

Flour: Because the factory has not yet opened, the stock in the market is decreasing day by day. Holders are taking advantage of the shortage to report higher prices.

Shengren is needed by the Guang Bang and is still traded at the limit price.

Edible Oil: Due to the ban on exports and restrictions on transit, people are bearish. Importers are eating at very low prices, but because the stock is not abundant and soybean prices are not cheap, cargo owners are not soft-hearted. Therefore, although there has been a slight decline, it is stable in fatigue. Dayou soybean oil traded at 51 yuan, and the rest traded at 50 yuan, a slight decrease of five jiao to one yuan five jiao. Due to the high price the previous day, raw oil fell by two yuan. Jilu raw oil did not open until the close at 62 yuan. Rapeseed oil was down five jiao to one yuan. Only the small car rattan oil of the Ke Bang was handled, up one yuan.

### Tea Market Sales Sluggish

After revealing a glimmer of dawn a few days ago, the foreign tea market ultimately remained unenthusiastic because sellers remained firm and exporters' demand was not urgent.

### National Banks Prepare to Supply Subsidiary Currency; Unauthorized Issuance of Vouchers Will Be Severely Punished

Since the issuance of the Gold Yuan Certificates, requests for exchange with legal tender, gold, silver, and foreign currencies have been very enthusiastic, and they are now widely circulating in the market. However, there is still a shortage of subsidiary currency and notes. It is now known that the Central Bank, in order to meet social needs, has long prepared a large quantity of subsidiary currency to meet the needs of exchange. If banks, money houses, and commercial and industrial entities have any needs, they may directly apply to the Central Bank's Business and Issuance Bureaus for exchange. However, since fractional currency has not yet arrived in large quantities, change can still be given at the rate of 30,000 legal tender to 1 fen. It has been rumored that some firms and companies have been issuing substitute vouchers without authorization, which is a blatant disregard for the law and undermines the currency system. Once verified, they will be severely punished according to law to prevent malpractices.

### Commercial Briefs

Yesterday morning in the silk market, prices rose to the limit. Da Cheng Silk Shop opened at 628 yuan and rose to the limit of 636.6 yuan before closing, immediately announcing an early market closure.

The supply and demand of medicinal materials were average. Elephant shell gradually sold off, but the loose market closed even with the previous day. Branch Scutellaria returned to its original price, and the rest remained unchanged.

New prices for industrial oils mostly followed the "August 19" market quotations, but transactions remained scarce. Prices in the production areas were still being negotiated, and few goods arrived. Dealers suffered losses, and customer orders were virtually non-existent.

(3) The actual new opening price is likely to be around 80 yuan.

### Slight Fluctuations in the Yarn Market; Cotton Cloth Demand Exceeds Supply, Initially Weak but Subsequently Firm

Yesterday's cotton yarn market condition: Due to the restriction on southward transportation, the Textile Construction Company continued to allocate sales, and the listed prices were also lower than the market values (including four types such as 20-count Great Flying Shuttle), so people's confidence gradually waned. Police and security teams were dispatched to supervise the scene, which was strictly enforced, so trading of spot yarn was still limited. Those who needed it in the Japanese Quarter could directly purchase it from the Textile Construction Company. The number of buyers on the floor decreased, and the number of sellers increased. Transactions were mainly in 32-count Xiantao, Jinyu, 20-count Jincheng, Golden Double Lions, Red Bee, Flying Horse, 10-count Mingbao Star, and Siping Lotus, a total of seven or eight categories. The prices were slightly lower than the limit prices. Re-processors entered the market when prices were low. There were thirteen transactions, totaling forty-two pieces.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions: At the beginning, due to the ban on southward transportation of yarn and cloth, and rumors that the authorities would thoroughly investigate the books, people panicked, and many sellers rushed to sell, resulting in flat and weak prices. Later, due to the extraordinary abundance of silver, cloth merchants and Tianjin and Yangtze merchants stationed in Shanghai competed to buy, resulting in a state where demand exceeded supply. All goods lingered at high prices, and transactions were concluded in accordance with the "August 19" limit prices. However, on-site supervision was still strict, and no one dared to openly call out prices. In order to suppress the rising trend, the Textile Construction Company was entrusted to sell off large quantities at 10:20 AM. This time, the bidding system was officially abandoned, and the Textile Construction Company set the prices.

12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth: 29.3 yuan per bolt; Four Gentlemen Yuan Straight Tribute: 29.8 yuan; Jumping Carp Yuan Serge: 25 yuan; Bleached Cloth: 28.5 yuan; Four Gentlemen Yuan Color Mercerized Cloth: 33 yuan; and Colored Floral Bed Sheets: 4.7 yuan each, totaling fourteen types.

Upon verification, there were 20 factories, totaling 1,400 bolts of cotton cloth; 872 cloth shops, totaling 36,680 bolts of cotton cloth and 590 bed sheets. 1,072,935 Gold Yuan was recovered. Trading on the floor closed early. 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth closed at 29.5 yuan, slightly better than the previous day, and even with the August 19 legal tender price of 8,850,000 yuan.

This film was produced by Min Hua Company during the war and is about to be sent abroad for screening. At the request of the Shanghai Confucius Society, a preview is being held on Confucius' birthday. Furthermore, the Confucius Society has submitted a document to the Ministry of Interior Affairs requesting that the film be awarded a certificate of commendation because of its serious and upright content. Peng Zhaoxian, Minister of Interior Affairs, has also expressed his high regard.

Special Broadcast: In addition, in order to promote Confucianism and the spirit of mutual assistance, the Confucius Society has launched a 10,000 yuan gold scholarship movement.

In addition to reporting on international joint relief efforts and research work and society affairs, the meeting will discuss the Charter for Teachers, the compilation plan for educational books, and how to use the US$3,000 donation from the American Education Association to build a library and clubhouse for the society, and to purchase domestic educational research materials.

### Zhu Ziqing Memorial Service: Mei Yi-qi and Others Delivered Eulogies of Mourning

[Report from Our Newspaper, Beiping, 26th] Zhu Ziqing's memorial service was held at Tsinghua today. From 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, family members, relatives, friends, and classmates offered sacrifices in order. Mei Yi-qi delivered a eulogy, saying that Mr. Zhu's attitude was always selfless, humble, and enthusiastic. He did his utmost for the school. Unfortunately, he passed away just over fifty years old, before us, which is a great loss to us. He advised everyone to value their health and live a few more years for their work. Feng Youlan said: Mr. Zhu had a great influence on new literature, and we have lost a powerful partner. Poverty took his life. Lu Zhizhang, Yang Zhensheng, Ma Heng and others also offered sacrifices. Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua sent a telegram of condolence. The funeral committee will build a clothing tomb for Mr. Zhu in the Western Hills.

### The Re-enrollment of Students from Henan and Shandong is Largely Agreed Upon

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The Ministry of Education has exchanged preliminary views with the principals of secondary schools from the provinces of Shandong and Henan who fled to Nanjing regarding the re-enrollment of students from these provinces. A general agreement has been reached on selecting a site for re-establishment of schools and on establishing joint secondary schools by combining several schools. The Ministry of Education will comprehensively discuss and decide on this matter within two days and then hand it over to the educational administrative authorities of the two provinces for implementation. The Director of the Shandong Provincial Education Department is already in Nanjing and can implement it first. The head of the secondary school section sent by the Henan Provincial Education Department is ill, and the Henan Provincial Government is currently being reorganized. The newly appointed Director of the Education Department has not yet taken office. The execution of the re-enrollment plan determined by the Ministry of Education will inevitably be delayed. However, in consideration of the fact that the schools in Nanjing that students have been borrowing are about to start classes, the Ministry of Education intends to find other houses to gather students from Henan Province who need to return to their province in order to allow the schools in Nanjing to start classes.

### School Fees Can Be Decided Tomorrow: Municipal Primary School Principals Confer Yesterday on Fee Standards; Increasing Local Education Fees Is Necessary to Increase Schools and Add Classes

[Report from Our Newspaper] The fee standards for primary and secondary schools in the city have not yet been decided. The Municipal Education Bureau separately convened meetings of principals of public and private primary and secondary schools to hear their opinions. Director Li has compiled the figures proposed by the principals and the standards drafted by the Education Bureau and reported them to Mayor Wu. It is now known that Mayor Wu has scheduled a meeting for tomorrow afternoon to invite principals and teachers' representatives from various public and private primary and secondary schools, as well as councilors and other relevant parties to discuss and make a final decision.

Director Li of the Municipal Education Bureau held a discussion meeting on municipal primary school fees at the Municipal He'an Primary School at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than one hundred principals attended, and the discussion was presided over by Director Li, Chief Zhu of the National Education Department, and Section Chief Lu. The principals spoke enthusiastically, lasting for three hours.

Education Association Demands: Representatives from the Municipal Primary School Teachers' Association also attended and requested: (1) Teachers' salaries should meet pre-war standards. (2) The salaries of municipal primary school teachers should not be lower than those of private primary school teachers, and should at least be equal, to avoid teacher turnover. (3) Continue to collect teacher training fees, similar to the last semester, accounting for about one-half of the total fees.

Director's Opinion: Director Li, in order to encourage schools to pay attention to physical education, specially stipulated that each student should pay one yuan for physical education this semester to enrich physical education equipment and strengthen physical education activities. In addition, Director Li suggested that other tuition, miscellaneous, and construction fees should not exceed ten yuan, that is, the total amount should not exceed eleven yuan. Some principals requested that the fee standard be eight yuan for teacher training fees, nine yuan and seven jiao for construction fees and miscellaneous fees, and one yuan for physical education fees, totaling eighteen yuan and seven jiao.

Adding Schools and Classes: The principals repeatedly mentioned the issue of adding schools and classes to accommodate students. Chief Zhu reported that the Education Bureau's plan to request the Municipal Government to add classes is being signed and submitted to the Mayor for review by the Municipal Government's Council Office and has not yet made a final decision. Director Li believes that the current municipal finances are indeed difficult. The fundamental solution is to hope that the Municipal Council can assist in raising local education funds to the constitutionally stipulated 35% of the municipal budget (currently 14%).

[Additional News] The Municipal Education Bureau will soon convene a discussion meeting of all national primary school principals in the city. Director Li instructed the principals yesterday that if they have any difficult problems, they can prepare in advance for discussion at the meeting. Mayor Wu will also be invited to attend and provide guidance.

### Private School Representatives Visit the Mayor

[Central News Agency, This City News] Chiang Chi-chou and eight other principals of private primary and secondary schools in the city visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 11:00 AM yesterday to express their views on the tuition fee standards for the next semester.

### Hangzhou Primary Schools Charge Two Yuan

[Report from Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 26th] It has been decided that public and private primary schools in Hangzhou will charge a total of two yuan for tuition and miscellaneous fees.

### Scholarship Unified Review Committee Issues Spoken Statement

[Report from Our Newspaper] Pan Gongzhan, Chairman of the Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee, and Li Ximou, Vice Chairman, issued a written statement yesterday stating: (1) Students of all levels of schools can apply for scholarships for this semester starting on September 1 of this year. At that time, each school can prepare a letter and send personnel to the committee to receive the application forms for distribution to students. (2) The deadline for students of all levels of schools to apply for scholarships for this semester is set at the end of September of this year. (3) When schools submit student scholarship application forms with a letter, they must attach a roster of free and public expense students for this semester, and a statistical table of the number of students in the entire school for this semester, otherwise they will not be reviewed. (4) In order to ensure that truly needy students receive more benefits, the number of scholarships for this semester may need to be reduced, but the amount of the scholarship that each needy student should receive will be appropriately increased; it is hoped that the school authorities will be earnestly responsible and strictly handle the preliminary review.

### Commemorating Confucius and Teachers Saving the Country: Minister of Education Zhu Writes and Publishes an Article on the Eve of Teachers' Day

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua published an article on the eve of this year's Teachers' Day entitled "Commemorating Confucius and Teachers Saving the Country." The content briefly stated: "Commemorating Confucius' Birthday: On the one hand, we commemorate Confucius' spirit of teaching without discrimination and being a teacher for all ages. On the other hand, we commemorate the arduous and continuous contributions of teachers at all levels across the country to national education. Confucius lived in the turbulent times of the late Zhou Dynasty, but he always maintained his compassionate heart and cried out to save the declining situation and bring the world to Great Harmony. This practical and solid spirit of turning the tide can make us imagine his painstaking efforts to worry about the times and save the world, and to defend the truth to the death. Today, the Communist bandits are rebelling, and the country is disturbed, which is an even worse environment than Confucius' time. Therefore, the great spirit of Confucius in helping the world and saving the people urgently needs to be promoted at present. During this period of suppression of rebellion, our national teachers should learn from Confucius to take benevolence as their responsibility and promote the spirit of eliminating chaos and restoring order; quell heresies and curb atrocities to save the people from misery. In particular, we should unite sincerely and work together under the national mobilization and rebellion suppression policy to engage in rebellion suppression work in education; make the education community itself the greatest stabilizing force in society. Today, commemorating Confucius' birthday and commemorating Teachers' Day, we must launch a teacher-saving-the-country movement." In conclusion, "Confucius never tired of learning and never tired of teaching. Of his three thousand disciples, seventy-two were proficient in the Six Arts. This spirit of patient instruction and teaching without discrimination can serve as a model for teachers across the country today. On the one hand, we should promote our country's inherent culture and cultivate the excellent moral character of young people; on the other hand, we should do our best to inspire young people's correct thinking of loving the country and the nation; to save China from its current crisis. In recent years, countless young students in the Northeast, North China, and various pacification zones have been displaced due to bandit disasters. And the Communist bandits' professional students have incited student unrest, causing the general student population to be poisoned and the country to suffer tangible and intangible damage. Our national teachers at all levels will certainly be able to assist the government, with one heart and one mind, to jointly save the serious crisis."

### He Haohua's Overturning Incident at the World Games Cycling Competition: A Special Report on the Tragedy at Herne Hill

— Special Correspondent Zhong Zhen of This Newspaper

[Report from Our Newspaper, London Airmail] Today, August 7 (Saturday), is the eighth day of the World Games. After the Chinese delegation's football team was miserably defeated, the basketball team also failed to enter the finals. Track and field and swimming had long been eliminated, so today's cycling competition at Herne Hill Park was undoubtedly the last hope for our Chinese team. Unexpectedly, during the competition, the bicycle ridden by our athlete He Haohua collided with the bicycle of a Belgian athlete about 50 yards from the finish line, and he was overturned. At a high speed of 60 miles per hour, he fell from the inclined cycling track, dislocating his left arm, fracturing his left collarbone, and breaking his skin on his hands and legs, bleeding profusely, a tragic sight. Fortunately, he was wearing a rubber helmet for protection, otherwise his skull would have been shattered and he would have died. All hope for our Chinese delegation was extinguished, which is regrettable. Mr. He Haohua also represented our country at the 12th World Games in Berlin in 1935. At that time, Mr. He was only 19 years old, and Mr. Lu Xiangqian, the current affairs officer, took care of him. Mr. He is a Dutch overseas student and runs a decoration company in the Netherlands. Because he could not speak Mandarin, there were rumors that his qualifications were in question, but it was proved that he was indeed of Chinese nationality, and there were no complications. Mr. He won the Dutch cycling championship in 1943. Last time in Berlin, he first encountered the world champion, and the difference was only a foot or so. Unexpectedly, this time he had an accident after the first competition, which is really unfortunate for our Chinese team. He had to abandon the 4,000-meter and long-distance races in pain.

At 10:30 AM on Saturday, August 7, the first cycling competition was held in Herne Hill Park in the southern suburbs of London. The first event was the 1,000-meter sprint. He Haohua was listed in the second group to compete against the Belgian Te Van Vliet. At the start, according to the cycling rules, the two cars need to run side by side in the first lap, slowly proceeding to the second lap, then competing at high speed. At the end of the first lap, Mr. He was behind the Belgian athlete because he started the car slower. Later, in the second half of the journey, he began to chase, and the difference between the two was only half a foot or so before reaching the finish line. At the end of the competition, Belgium won the championship with a time of two minutes and four seconds. But Mr. He still had a chance to compete in the 4,000-meter and long-distance competition. Unexpectedly, when passing the finish line, because the racing car had no brakes, it could not stop immediately. About 50 yards away on the slope, the front wheel of Mr. He's car collided with the rear wheel of Te Van Vliet's car, and the bicycle immediately overturned. Mr. He was thrown more than ten feet and rolled four or five times before landing in the grass. At that time, the surrounding audience shouted loudly. The tragic scene of the overturning is really indescribable. Our country's affairs officer and medical consultant Dr. Deng Bingming rushed into the field to rescue him. The reporter also entered the field with him. Mr. He was lying on a single bed, still conscious, tears streaming down his face. He shouted in English, "I can't contribute to the country." Officials from various countries in the field all knew that Mr. He was a famous European cyclist. Today, he suffered this tragedy, and everyone was deeply moved. It is also reported that the cause of this tragedy was a sudden tire leak. The reporter happily took pictures of the competition and returned disappointed, with endless regrets in his heart.

### "Yes-Man"

— Zhang Qing

"Yes-Man" refers to a "Yes-man." Thirty years ago, when "vernacular novels" were just becoming popular, novels would invariably use "also" to represent the Chinese word "right" or "yes" when referring to Westerners speaking. Why the circumlocution? We younger generations have no way of knowing, but it was probably just a way to keep up with the times. Now, thinking of the name "Yes-Man" evokes a sense of historical reflection.

Since the three words "Yes-Man" were imported from abroad, it's conceivable that there must be many such people in foreign countries. For example, Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States, has the nickname "City of Yes-Men." With the concentration of government offices, one naturally sees many clever people who are adept at handling all situations. If you say, "The weather is good today," they will certainly reply, "Absolutely fantastic weather!" Then they will laugh heartily, each satisfied. Such is the way of social interaction in officialdom; everyone knows what's going on in their hearts, but on the surface, they must always smile.

However, the most important use of the "Yes-Man's" constant "yes" is not in dealing with colleagues, but in serving superiors. They are not only good at observing facial expressions and going with the flow, but also extremely sensitive, always eager to agree enthusiastically but never actually taking action. Because taking action is easy to reveal flaws, with a fifty-fifty chance of doing well or poorly. If they happen to do poorly, and a smiling colleague reports them to the superior when the superior is in a bad mood, wouldn't their job be in jeopardy?

The wise "Yes-Man" knows the importance of their job, so they naturally won't take such risks.

However, it's not a pretty sight to have offices filled with smartly dressed officials, big and small, spending their days reading gossip magazines and talking about women. And "Yes-Men" place great importance on appearances. Therefore, they have devised a way to do things on the surface without actually doing anything: they allow official documents to travel at an extremely slow pace, with one person stamping a seal, another signing a name, until the travel time becomes too long, then they write "under review" and file it away.

The "Yes-Man" says that his approach is based on philosophy, called "governing by doing nothing." When a journalist interviews a newly appointed "Yes-Man," he also has a statement to make, saying "not seeking merit, but seeking to avoid mistakes." To avoid both merit and mistakes, it is of course best to "do nothing." However, doing absolutely nothing is also unacceptable, as there would be no response to questions from legislative bodies. Therefore, everyone does as little as possible, using financial difficulties as a convenient excuse. If something absolutely must be done, they strive to make it look "good" and easy to get reimbursed.

However, if I were to use a phrase from Han Feizi, I could say, "A Yes-Man is not always a Yes-Man." A true "Yes-Man" will naturally have times when he doesn't say "yes." He has rivals for favor, whom he must harm while maintaining a pleasant demeanor; and the most troublesome thing is that there still seem to be clueless fools in the world who want to be good officials who follow the rules. What to do?

Thus, the practice of forming cliques and engaging in private dealings flourishes.

"Yes-Men" not only say "yes," but also "get yes-ed." For example, if the "Yes-Minister" gets angry, he will go and scold the "Yes-Director." The "Yes-Director" will certainly listen respectfully, then say, "Yes, I deserve to die!" Going back, he will scold the "Yes-Chief." After the chief respectfully hears everything, he admits mistake and says "yes," then goes back and scolds the "Yes-Head." The Head does the same thing. And it will continue until it reaches a miserable clerk. After the clerk gets home, he scolds his wife and beats his son.

What about that son? After being beaten, he may secretly spit on the ground and mutter, "Damn it!"

That's how it is. When he grows up, he will probably continue to be a "Yes-Man."

### The Telephone Shortage in America

— Mao Yi

America is not only experiencing a housing shortage like Shanghai, but also a telephone shortage. Although Bell Telephone Company has installed 6.5 million new telephones in the two years since the victory, more than 1.5 million orders are still backlogged and unfulfilled.

The main shortage is in wiring and switchboards. The process of connecting a local call is extremely complex, involving countless pieces of telephone equipment.

In 1945, one out of every two households in the United States had a telephone; now, almost two out of every three households have one. In 1940, roughly one out of every four rural households had a telephone, but now it has developed to the point where nearly two out of every four households have one. In terms of population distribution, San Francisco has the most telephones, with 44 telephones per 100 people. Washington, D.C. is second, with 41 telephones per 100 people; New York is third, with an average of 29 telephones per 100 people.

The more difficult it is to install a telephone, the more people seem to want to install one. People are offering tips of up to $500 to install a telephone. Because veterans have priority in getting telephones installed, some companies are using them as a front. Also, because business telephones have priority over private telephones, some people living in apartments are renting office suites to make money, disguising their homes as commercial offices. Furthermore, some healthy people are asking doctors for help in proving that they are sick in order to get priority in installing a telephone; with so many "patients" applying for telephone installation, some telephone company employees have had to keep medical dictionaries by their side. They sometimes discover that the alarming-sounding medical terms used in doctors' reports actually only mean that the patient has a severe cold or sore throat.

Americans are also making more telephone calls. The number of long-distance calls they now make in a day is more than the number of calls made in a week in 1940, and the number of overseas calls is ten times the total number in 1940.

Even children are making more telephone calls than before the war. As soon as school is dismissed, the number of telephone calls suddenly increases. The telephone company has published notices asking children to conserve telephone usage. Recently, the general manager of Bell Telephone Company received a letter from a teenage boy saying that his social life was being "hampered" by the lack of a telephone, with this sentence: "The girls can't call me, and they're complaining too!" The general manager sent him a tactful reply, adding at the end: "P.S. When I was sixteen, I didn't have a telephone either."

### Casual Reminiscences of a Trip to Wu

— Cao Jingtao

A few days ago, I happened to travel to Wumen and drank tea at Maoyuan, recalling that during the Yichou year (1925), I gathered here daily with Mr. Kuang Huifeng. Counting the years, it has been more than twenty years. Mr. Huifeng's tomb is already covered with grass, and I am also growing old. Pondering the present and recalling the past, I am filled with emotions.

When I was young, I studied poetry. One night, I wrote a poem, saying: "Unable to sleep on a spring night, I sit alone by a quiet lamp. Dewdrops moisten the steps, the well windlass creaks. Wind comes from the waves, the moon casts shadows on the flowers. A neighboring flute suddenly sounds, entrusting thoughts to the desolate scenery." Mr. Huifeng praised this poem highly after Chen Sanuan showed it to him. In the summer of Yichou, Mr. Huifeng moved to Wumen and visited me in Zhuanzhu Lane, which was the beginning of my acquaintance with him.

Mr. Huifeng was sixty-eight years old that year, dressed in Taoist attire, appearing ethereal and otherworldly. When he passed through the streets, thousands of people stared at him.

One day, Mr. Wu Quan, from Beijing, came and hosted a banquet for Mr. Dong and his son at a restaurant in the city, inviting me and Mr. Yu Sulu to accompany them. At that time, Mr. Sulu was nearly eighty years old, looking very old. Mr. Huifeng insisted that he try singing, and he actually sang with a full voice and precise steps, reverberating like clouds being stopped, unattainable by others.

Mr. Quan summoned a courtesan to serve wine. One courtesan was not beautiful, but Mr. Huifeng particularly appreciated her, and the young masters whispered to each other privately. Mr. Huifeng then asked, "What do you two think of this woman?" The young masters were embarrassed and dared not answer yes or no. Mr. Huifeng smiled and said, "This woman seems vulgar but is actually elegant, what is called clear amidst turbidity! It's just that you are too young to know her beauty!" The two guests applauded.

Mr. Huifeng was skilled in examining remaining ink, with exceptional talent and ability, on par with Mr. Zhu Guwei. Mr. Huifeng himself said that he rarely wrote poetry, and when he did, it was not very skillful. He had several quatrains from his early years, which he occasionally recited to me, but I have now forgotten them, only remembering the two lines, "Thirty-six bridges are unparalleled in the world, the people of Jiangnan are most of all from Suzhou." In my humble opinion, their style is actually closer to lyrics in recent times.

Mr. Huifeng lived in Wu for a very short time, to avoid internal turmoil, before returning to Shanghai. A month later, he suddenly passed through Suzhou and married a certain woman, his heroic spirit no less than that of Xiong Bing San and Li Shizeng.

### Verses Near the Clouds

— Bai Jiao

Composed When Yao Nanyuan Sent a Rhyme that Was Difficult to Respond To

Gazing intently at the distant misty flowers, the warm wind irons the traces of the brush dry. Adding branches and leaves truly requires momentum, the mountain slopes and valleys must be settled. Who enters the room forgetting offensive smells? Danqing is useless, I dip my brush. Recently, I have slightly avoided the intention of facing the door; in each piece of cloudy peaks, there are rocky mountains. (Inscription on an Ink Orchid Scroll)

The autumn heat is like baking, thirst is finally quenched, the feelings of past years are like exchanging books on gourds. A three-day feast fills the belly, a taste of coolness settles the residence; waiting to laugh at the children who are busy remembering, but pitying the old man's hesitation, composing poems to thank is truly shameless, thinking that there must be a surplus at the east gate.

### The Books Stored in Wen Su Ge Are Safe

— Zhai Meilin

Yesterday, I read Mr. Zhou Tingwu's article "The Books Stored in Wen Su Ge" in your publication, and I deeply share his feelings of love and concern for the cultural relics of our homeland. I have recently come to Beijing from my hometown of Shenyang to seek employment and know that the Siku Quanshu in Wen Su Ge is still completely intact, preserved at its original location on the west side of the Qing Palace in Pan Yang. The buildings are tall and the book shelves are complete and undamaged. Since the September 18th Incident, it has been under the control of the enemy, the puppets, and the Communists, all of whom have taken good care of it. The Japanese did not loot or transport it. After the August 15th recovery, the central government even sent Mr. Jin Yufu to be responsible for sorting out the cultural relics of the Northeast, with daily additions. The pavilion is now open to the public, and each volume is not only beautifully written but also elegantly and simply bound with fine paper, making it an invaluable treasure.

In addition, for more than two hundred years under the Qing dynasty, the deceased emperors and empresses of each dynasty were granted royal documents. All the jade documents, made of dark green jade, varied in size depending on the rank of the empress, numbering in the hundreds of cases. They are also displayed in the same place as the Siku Quanshu.

Wen Su Ge has a guest book for visitors to sign their names. Mr. Wu Tiecheng, Dai Tianchou, Chu Weijun, and Zhao Daiwen have all signed their names. This book will be passed down to future generations along with the complete collection of books and jade documents. The dates of the inscriptions are roughly in the teens of the Republic era, more than twenty years ago. What is valuable is not only that those who signed their names were able to view the complete collection of books, but also that during their time in Pan, they each shouldered great missions, the impact of which on China should be even more important than the complete collection of books. The history of today since the seventeenth year of the Republic of China may have originated at that time, another karmic connection with the complete collection of books.

Now that my hometown is engulfed in flames and the people are suffering, it is fortunate that the national treasures are still safe. I am writing this brief account to inform those who are concerned. But without the skin, where can the hair attach itself? If the country's territory is not valued, then what is the value of this Siku Quanshu?

### Gold

— Qian Wen

When Wang Mang fled, the palace had 600,000 catties of gold. He did not treat this national precious metal as his private property, refusing to sink it into the sea or bury it in the valleys, but leaving it for those who came later. This was the enlightened behavior of a political failure. The Han Dynasty had national gold stored in the palace, but it was not hoarded. Ancient and modern power systems are different. Others have calculated that 600,000 catties is equivalent to 288,000 catties in the Qing Dynasty.

Dong Zhuo collected many treasures looted from the Wubao, but very little gold. It is said that it was only 20,000 to 30,000 catties, and silver was only 80,000 to 90,000 catties. Was it that gold was scattered among the people and difficult to collect, or that he did not value precious metals? One of the two must be true. He Shen of the Qing Dynasty had a total private property worth 800 million taels of silver, but only 26,800 taels of gold ingots and gold leaves were found in the hidden walls of his home, which cannot be considered much. Did he also not value gold?

The amount of gold hidden among the people is difficult to estimate. Ren Fang's "Record of Strange Events" says that when Yuan Shao was in Jizhou, the market was full of gold but there was no millet for sale; when Liu Bei was in Jingzhou, millet and gold were of equal value; during the Yongjia Rebellion, Luoyang was barren, and Emperor Huai sent people to observe the market. Pearls, jade, gold, and silver were openly displayed in the market, but there was no millet or wheat. At the end of the Han Dynasty, there was a great famine, and a Jianghuai folk song said that exchanging gold for millet was more valuable than gold; a Luoyang nursery rhyme said that even with a thousand taels of gold, it was not as good as a dou of millet. During war and famine, it was impossible to get millet. There was so much gold among the people that it was no wonder that Ren regarded it as strange and recorded it. Gu Yanwu said that before the Tang and Song dynasties, the goods commonly used by the upper and lower classes were all money. He also quoted the "Comprehensive Examination of Documents," saying that during the Liang dynasty, the regions of Jiaoguang traded entirely in gold and silver. This is evidence that the amount of gold held by the people was gradually increasing.

Ancient gold was not as valuable as it is today. Gu Yanwu said that in the eighth year of Hongwu, one tael of gold was worth four taels of silver, which is what is called four-to-one exchange. In the eighteenth year of Hongwu, it was a five-to-one exchange, in the eleventh year of Yongle, it was seven-and-a-half-to-one, in the Wanli period, it was seven- or eight-to-one, in the Chongzhen period, it was ten-to-one, and in the Zhida period of the Yuan dynasty, it was also ten-to-one. This shows that the price of gold gradually increased and was constantly changing. The Zhida and Chongzhen periods were three hundred and twenty or thirty years apart, but the exchange rate was the same, ten-to-one. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, it was as high as thirty-six-to-one; in the early years of the Republic of China, it was only about that. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, when the war was raging, it was about one hundred-to-one, but I don't remember clearly. Song Yingxing's "Exploitation of the Works of Nature" was woodblock printed in the Chongzhen Dingchou year. The book states that the value of the finest gold is sixteen thousand times that of black iron. Adding Gu Yanwu's ten-to-one exchange rate, 160 taels of silver could buy one catty of gold, or 16,000 catties of black iron, which is a little less than ten tons.

Song also said that the weight of gold is extremely high. If a copper square inch weighs one tael, then silver should be increased by three qian per inch; if a silver square inch weighs one tael, then gold should be increased by two qian per inch. This is the metal specific gravity known to the Chinese people three hundred years ago.

The ancients believed that the greatest consumption of gold was in the creation of Buddhist statues, which is a fact. For example, the "History of the Wei Dynasty" states that in the first year of Xingguang, five statues of Sakyamuni, each sixteen feet tall, were planned, all using 25,000 catties of pure gold; in the Tian'an period, a statue of Sakyamuni, forty-three feet tall, was made, using 100,000 catties of pure gold and 600 catties of gold. In fact, the consumption of gold was not limited to this. The utensils of the rich and the screens and windows in the house were often gilded, and the total amount must have been greater than that used by the Buddhist statues in various temples, but because they were scattered, they were not as noticeable as the Buddhist statues. "Exploitation of the Works of Nature" says that seven li of gold is used to make each square inch of gold leaf, which is really too thick, and there is no such luxury now. According to this book, using a thousand pieces to cover a surface, it can cover three feet in length and width, because three feet square is nine hundred square inches, requiring nine hundred pieces of gold leaf weighing seven li each, using more than six taels and three qian of gold. I believe that the gold leaf used by emperors to make Buddhist statues must have been thicker, while that used by the common people was slightly thinner. Scientists say that one li of gold can actually be rolled into gold leaf seventy-five inches square, with a thickness of 1/367,000 of an inch, and one li is 1/5760 of a troy pound.

After the war, my wedding gold ring has also disappeared, and the two gold false teeth that I still have in my mouth, I don't know how much pure gold they contain.
