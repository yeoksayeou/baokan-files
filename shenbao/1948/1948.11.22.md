### Bandit Officers and Soldiers are Tired of War and Defect

Company Commander Wu Huang Leads 37 to Return

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 21st] After our victory in the Three Forts battle, the morale of Chen Yi's 3rd Column and the Guangdong-Guangxi Columns was greatly dampened. According to Wu Huang, a company commander of the bandit army who defected during the Three Forts battle: The column was exhausted from marching all night, and the officers and soldiers had no will to fight. During the fierce fighting, they hid and fled to the Nationalist army's positions. The main reasons for the column's defeat were that they were intimidated by the superior firepower of the Nationalist army, and that the officers and soldiers of the bandit army had a strong sense of war weariness. Therefore, once contact was made, except for those who were deeply indoctrinated by the bandits and stubbornly acted as cannon fodder, the others all took the opportunity to defect to the Nationalist army. Wu Huang, 27 years old, has been forced into the army for nearly five years. He joined the party in November of the year and, in view of the various darknesses of the bandits, was unwilling to be deceived and indoctrinated. During the Three Forts battle, he led the propaganda member Wu Zhongmei, the group leaders Tan Jinsheng, He Fulu, Li Zhen, Luo Yiming, Huang Zhiming (all of whom were cadre party members in the bandit army), and soldiers Liu Lianhua and 37 others, carrying one light machine gun and 32 rifles, to defect. This proves that the bandit army's war-weariness has become an indisputable ironclad proof. Also, during the Three Forts battle, when a certain corps of our army was pursuing the bandits, five soldiers, including Yang Yuxiang, from the 5th company of the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Guangdong-Guangxi Columns, after hearing the Nationalist army's shouts of "Welcome to defect, preferential treatment for defection," immediately shot and killed their deputy company commander, carrying three Zhongzheng rifles, one Czech rifle, one box of machine gun bullets, and 20 hand grenades to defect. The soldiers have now received a bonus of 500 yuan and are eager to go to the front line to help the Nationalist army shout and kill the enemy.

### MacArthur's Visit to China Unconfirmed; U.S. Experts Advocate Sending MacArthur as Military Advisor to China

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday's report about Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Japan, MacArthur's visit to China, was inquired about by reporters to the head of the US Information Service here. They were told that they had not heard of this news so far, and they had not heard that MacArthur was preparing to come to China. According to observations from relevant parties here, the possibility of MacArthur's visit to China is extremely small, and this news may be a misreport.

[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] It was widely rumored in Tokyo on the morning of the 21st that General MacArthur had already gone to China or was about to go to China, but there is apparently no factual basis for this. Allied headquarters officials here were busy answering inquiries from people trying to confirm this news. The State Department and the Department of the Army in Washington also said they had heard nothing. But no one can confirm that MacArthur would not consult with President Chiang in China. However, he would definitely not go to China in the next few hours, because first, he must meet with the heads of the Allied delegations here on the 22nd to review the verdicts of the Far East International Military Tribunal against Tojo and other 25 major war criminals; second, General Barr, the head of the U.S. Joint Military Advisory Group to China, has just arrived in Japan. Even if MacArthur intends to go to China, he will first consult with Barr. It is widely rumored here that General Barr's departure from China to come here is to consult with MacArthur and prepare a plan for MacArthur's visit to China.

[Another Dispatch] Senior U.S. officials here believe that the situation in China is becoming increasingly clear. Although MacArthur and his senior assistants remain silent about the situation in China, because China is not within MacArthur's administrative scope, MacArthur is undoubtedly constantly collecting detailed information about the development of the situation in China. U.S. experts here believe that appointing famous U.S. military figures such as MacArthur or General Wedemeyer as the top military advisors to the Chinese government and approving full military assistance—mainly in the form of weapons and equipment transported to China—will guarantee victory on the battlefield.

### Government Allocates 100 Million US Dollars in Gold, Silver, and Foreign Exchange to Purchase Supplies and Contract Currency; US Aid Supplies to Arrive in the Country by April Next Year; Outline of Implementation of Import and Export Linking System Announced

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] Finance Minister Xu Kan made the following remarks regarding the two cases passed by the Executive Yuan: the Outline of Implementation of the Import and Export Trade Linking System and the Key Points of the Organization of the Executive Yuan Economic Coordination Committee. On November 20th, the Executive Yuan's temporary meeting passed the Outline of Implementation of the Import and Export Trade Linking System and the Key Points of the Organization of the Executive Yuan Economic Coordination Committee, proposed by the Ministry of Finance. The main purpose is to encourage exports and facilitate overseas remittances to increase foreign exchange sources and the import of important materials. However, at present, due to the decline in domestic production, obstructed transportation, and the severe shortage of materials, increasing exports and overseas remittances alone cannot compensate. It is noted that of the total US aid materials valued at US$200 million, only US$60 million has been used so far, and materials worth another US$40 million are being sold. The remaining US$100 million has not yet been designated for use. In order to coordinate with our country's new economic measures, it has been agreed with the US Economic Cooperation Administration to expedite planning for phased purchases, aiming to transport all of them to the country before April next year, and to ensure that the funds are used through existing commercial channels as much as possible. On our country's side, the government has decided to allocate gold, silver, and foreign exchange equivalent to US$100 million to purchase domestic and foreign materials and contract currency within the above four-month period. It is expected that after the implementation of this cooperation method, the domestic material shortage problem can be solved, and it will greatly help absorb idle funds and stabilize the financial economy. Furthermore, the establishment of the Economic Coordination Committee aims to strengthen US aid coordination and improve work efficiency. In terms of Sino-US economic cooperation, it may create a new milestone.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] News Bureau News: The Outline of Implementation of the Import and Export Trade Linking System passed by the Executive Yuan's temporary meeting on the 20th is as follows: (1) All foreign exchange earned from export goods shall be handed over to the Central Bank or its designated banks in exchange for foreign exchange transfer certificates of equal value. (2) All overseas remittances and other foreign exchange remittances from overseas Chinese shall be handed over to the Central Bank or its designated banks in exchange for foreign exchange transfer certificates of equal value, and they may be directly transferred to the Central Bank or its designated bank at their discretion. (3) Foreign exchange transfer certificates may be used to offset loans required for holding import permits or for non-import foreign exchange needs approved. (4) Holders of foreign exchange transfer certificates may use or transfer them themselves in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article, and the time limit shall not exceed two months. (5) Imported goods are divided into quota and non-quota categories according to their nature. Quota goods are distributed to importers and producers, and non-quota goods are approved with priority according to domestic needs. (6) The measures for import and export trade and their appendices, as well as the Central Bank's regulations for managing foreign exchange, shall be amended separately in accordance with the provisions of this outline.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 21st] The Executive Yuan passed the establishment of the Economic Coordination Committee on the 20th, and its key points of organization are as follows: (1) In order to coordinate US aid, regulate materials, and stabilize the financial economy, the Executive Yuan has specially established the Economic Coordination Committee. (2) The committee shall have one chairman, who shall be concurrently held by the President of the Executive Yuan or appointed by the President as a representative. The committee shall also have six members, who shall be concurrently held by the Minister of Finance, Minister of Communications, Minister of Industry and Commerce, Minister of Food, Chairman of the National Resources Commission, and the President of the Central Bank. The committee shall also have one secretary-general. (3) When the committee meets, it may invite representatives from the Economic Cooperation Administration to attend. (4) The committee shall establish an executive group, which shall be organized by representatives of the Ministry of Finance, representatives of the Central Bank, and the Secretary-General of the US Aid Committee, to implement the policies and resolutions of the committee. (5) When the executive group meets, representatives from the Economic Cooperation Administration shall be invited to attend.

Editorial

### Sympathy for Primary and Secondary School Teachers

The price surge following the currency reform has impacted every corner of society, with the education sector being the most severely threatened. In various places like Beijing and Shanghai, primary and secondary school teachers have been requesting relief and going on strike due to the pressure of life, which is naturally a very serious situation. From the 16th, all teachers and staff above the municipal middle school level in Shanghai took collective leave, and the municipal primary school teachers and staff also took collective leave from the 19th. Fortunately, after Mayor Wu's persuasive advocacy, they have agreed to resume teaching today, and it is hoped that there will be no further changes. Private primary and secondary school teachers are not optimistic about the authorities' relief and the schools' additional tuition fees. It is said that there is also a trend of collective leave. This is a very serious social problem and reflects the crisis of the entire education system, which deserves great attention. If the government authorities and school supervisors do not take immediate action to save the situation, it would undoubtedly be a cause for great concern.

The lives of primary and secondary school teachers have always been difficult, especially for teachers in public schools. They have always been understanding of the country's difficulties, obeyed the government's laws and regulations, and lived a life of poverty and joy, teaching with empty stomachs, and adhering to the sacred position of "education first," educating the second generation for the country and society. Although their lives are not as good as workers, let alone merchants, they have always endured it for the sake of their sacred responsibility. This spirit of endurance has been brought to the extreme. Recently, due to the flaws arising from the currency reform, prices have been rising crazily like a runaway horse, with the rise in the price of rice being the most significant. As a result, teachers who were already impoverished were forced to the brink of starvation. The collective leave of primary and secondary school teachers in Beijing and Shanghai, which was decided not by prior agreement, should objectively be considered a measure of going on strike because they are not able to eat enough. Subjectively, the abandonment of students' studies due to the teachers' collective leave, which affects the progress of education, cannot but be said to be a loss to the students and society. However, the vast majority of students, witnessing the hungry faces of the teachers, not only forgive the teachers' actions but also sympathize with the teachers' plight and support the teachers' position. Moreover, collective leave is a temporary measure, and the problem must be resolved and needs to be resolved quickly and satisfactorily. Mayor Wu, Chairman Pan, the principals of the schools, and the teachers all have a clear understanding of this. We hope that the teachers and the government will resume teaching resolutely based on mutual understanding.

The government authorities have a responsibility to solve the problem of collective leave for primary and secondary school teachers, and public opinion also has a responsibility. The fundamental solution is to rationally establish a salary system for educators so that they can serve the education cause with peace of mind. The immediate solution is to relieve the current financial difficulties of educators. The liaison association of municipal primary and secondary school teachers in Shanghai said on the 20th that before the war, the salary of municipal primary and secondary school teachers could buy five to ten piculs of rice, but the current average income is 140 to 150 yuan, which can only buy two to three dou of rice, plus three dou of allocated rice, totaling five to six dou. It is very difficult to maintain the family's life with this. This kind of predicament should be a true portrayal. They demand that the government have a fundamental solution so that the pre-war standard can be brought closer to the post-war situation. The current relief solution that addresses the immediate symptoms, is the unanimous demand of primary and secondary school teachers. They hope to get one picul of rice, two bags of flour, and 500 gold yuan as emergency relief. According to the actual situation, their demands are by no means excessive. Even if they achieve the above-mentioned relief as they ideally wish, it will not improve their living standards. Although the government authorities also feel that the funds are exhausted and it is difficult to cope with the situation, it is still hoped that they can understand their suffering and provide practical and possible relief at their discretion. At the same time, it is also hoped that the teachers will resume teaching first, restore the normal order of education, and then discuss the fundamental solution.

Public opinion is very sympathetic to the collective leave of municipal primary and secondary school teachers; however, some private primary and secondary schools are taking the opportunity to extend their hands to students to collect additional tuition fees, and even suspending classes to wait for payment, which should be considered. The systems of public schools and private schools are different, and the fee standards are different. The difficulties of public schools are not entirely the same as those of private schools. Although the lives of teachers in both public and private schools are equally difficult, the financial management and vested interests of private school supervisors are unlikely to suffer losses under any circumstances. At the beginning of the school year, prices were in a low ebb, and the value of the tuition fees paid by students according to the school's regulations for "this semester" has not changed. It is unreasonable for private school principals to not pay teachers' salaries in advance according to the income and expenditure budget at the beginning of the school year and now want to shift the monetary losses to the students' parents. The Bureau of Education's permission for private schools to collect "respect for teachers' money" or "teachers' welfare money" from parents opens the door for private schools to increase tuition fees. Families with better financial conditions should have a sense of responsibility and should provide assistance to the schools' difficulties; but for families in poverty and civil servants' families, this unexpected burden is indeed difficult to bear. Based on morality and conscience, the parents of poor students should not feel guilty for not accepting the additional tuition fees from private schools. It is hoped that the education authorities and private schools will recognize this clearly and not make mandatory regulations to avoid causing social disturbances.

In short, the current situation of the entire education system is facing the most serious and dangerous stage. Those who are responsible should not abandon their duties and should firmly take responsibility to quickly improve the living conditions of teachers at all levels, rescue the education crisis, and overcome the current difficulties.

The original telegram said: "The bandits Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng, etc., gathered 500,000 troops to invade Xuzhou. The great battle began on the 6th. Relying on the confidential deployment of our Commander-in-Chief Liu and the orders of the soldiers, the stubborn enemies were repeatedly defeated. It is estimated that more than 100,000 bandits have been wiped out in the past few days. The glorious record is unprecedented since the suppression of bandits. The good news has spread, and the people are excited and happy. The spirit of sacrifice and the heroic deeds of our national army soldiers on the battlefield are especially commendable. In order to encourage morale, eliminate the stubborn bandits again, permanently stabilize the Jianghuai area, and restore our Lu and Yu, in addition to the extensive mobilization of funds by our association in various counties and cities to comfort the troops, we deeply feel that the financial resources of one place are meager and insufficient to reward the battle achievements of the soldiers who have fought hard and established meritorious services on the border.

The Vanguard newspaper added a double-line, extra-large headline before the report, saying, "The Chinese National Army Wins a Glorious Victory in the Battle with the Communist Army in Xuzhou."

### Nanyang Overseas Chinese Taiwan Visiting Group Encourages Overseas Compatriots to Return to the Country to Invest; Dai Kui Sheng and Qiu Hanping Broadcast to Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 20th] Dai Kui Sheng, leader of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese organization's Taiwan visiting group, recently broadcast to overseas compatriots here, saying: "Today's new world situation has forced overseas Chinese to find a new way out. Under the current situation of war clouds and disturbances everywhere in Southeast Asia, we believe that Taiwan is a relatively stable place where overseas Chinese wealth and manpower can be placed." Another overseas Chinese leader, Qiu Hanping, followed Dai and broadcast to overseas Chinese compatriots, saying: "Since the two world wars, the politics and economy of every corner of the world have undergone major changes. The impact on overseas Chinese is beyond words. In the past, overseas Chinese were welcomed everywhere, but now they are suffering everywhere. The current situation of overseas Chinese is very different from before. We should find a new way out. In the past, the virtues of overseas Chinese were enduring hardship, diligence, thrift, keeping to themselves, and a spirit of sacrifice, which created the status of overseas Chinese, but they all focused on personal struggle and lacked an organization suitable for modern large-scale enterprise groups. If we don't turn back now, it will be too late. I believe that the economic undertakings of overseas Chinese in the future should pay attention to the following four points: First, we should communicate international trade. Overseas Chinese have abundant capital and outstanding commercial talents. In the current environment of imbalance in the supply and demand of materials between China and foreign countries, overseas Chinese must engage in international trade to cooperate with the motherland's economic policies. In this way, not only will overseas Chinese find a way out, but the motherland and the place of residence will also be able to obtain material regulation. Second, we should popularize the company organization. In the past, most of the economic undertakings of overseas Chinese were sole proprietorships. Once they encountered setbacks, they would collapse and all their previous efforts would be in vain. In the past 20 years, although there have been occasional companies, most of them are still nominal. This old concept, which is not suitable for modern trends, should be abandoned. We must use the power of the people and work together to organize various joint-stock companies, entrust special parties to be responsible for management, and let those with capital decide the direction and guide the path, so that the business is stable and avoids conflicts of interest with individuals in the past. Third, we should return to the country to invest in production undertakings. In the past, the amount of overseas remittances has always been huge, but unfortunately, it has only been used for personal wealth, such as building houses and buying fields, and even building temples to worship Buddha. At most, it has only been used to run hometown education undertakings. The investment in production undertakings is really rare. In the future, we must pay attention to investing in production undertakings to prevent this increasingly serious world situation. As for the general public who believe that the current turbulent situation in the motherland is not conducive to investment, this is a mistake. There are many production undertakings with favorable development in the rear, and safety is not a problem. If investing in the country is considered unsafe, then where is the safety in the troubled Southeast Asia? Fourth, we should embark on the path of industrial and mining enterprises. In the past, most overseas Chinese engaged in the retail industry. In the future, in order to avoid being controlled by the local environment, we should embark on the path of industrial and mining enterprises. This is not only beneficial to personal economy, but also beneficial to local prosperity and government revenue. We will definitely be welcomed and assisted by local people and the government.

### "Negotiation is More Difficult Than War, Endure Hardship and Await Change" Hu Shi's Speech at the North China Suppression Headquarters on the International Situation, The Youth Party Believes There is No Possibility of Restoring Peace Talks at Present

[Our Newspaper Beiping 20th Dispatch] Hu Shi gave a speech on the international situation at the North China Suppression Headquarters at 3:00 PM on the 20th, concluding that "Negotiation is more difficult than war. Endure hardship and await change." Hu Shi's speech on the issue of peace included: "Don't be impatient in demanding peace. Negotiation is more difficult than war, a thousand times more difficult. To talk about peace with the Chinese Communists is simply a fantasy." He cited Marshall as an example, saying: Marshall was the chief of staff of the Allied democratic countries in the Second World War. He defeated the Axis powers of Germany and Japan, but after spending years in China, he could not make the peace talks between the Nationalists and Communists succeed. Hu Shi concluded that the only thing to do now is to endure hardship and await change. The so-called awaiting change does not necessarily mean the outbreak of a third world war. As long as we have confidence in our way of life (a way of life with democracy, freedom, and peace) and can endure, then in six months or a year, the situation will not be without change. This change will definitely benefit us. When asked about the impact of Truman's election on the overall situation, Hu Shi read a section of Truman's March last year's message to Congress requesting assistance to Greece and Turkey, believing that Truman would definitely follow the precedent of assisting Greece and Turkey to assist China. He believes that Beiping will never be lost, so he told foreign reporters that Peking University will not move in a month, two months, half a year, or a year.

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] A responsible person from the Youth Party here unofficially expressed his views on the current situation, believing that there is absolutely no possibility of restoring peace talks at present, because the prerequisite for achieving domestic peace is that the Chinese Communists withdraw from the Communist International and abandon armed struggle, and to expect the Chinese Communists to make such concessions is like trying to find fish in trees. Conversely, if a "coalition government" is formed with the Chinese Communists as the center, the fate of our country will be no different from that of Czechoslovakia and Hungary. The only hope at present is to create a foundation for domestic peace through international coordination and to hope that the authorities will conscientiously implement democracy to eliminate domestic difficulties.

### Yu Bin Delivers Speech, Analyzing the Anti-Communist War

Believing it Relates to the Happiness of the Nation and Mankind

[Central News Agency, Nanjing 21st Dispatch] Bishop Yu Bin delivered a speech at the joint annual meeting of the Sixth and Seventh Sessions of the Chinese Catholic Cultural Association on the 21st, criticizing the general public's lack of clear understanding of the current issues, which has led to the current serious situation. He pointed out that today's war is a comprehensive cultural war, a war without national borders or family boundaries. It must start with ideological warfare, arm the people's will, build a spiritual Great Wall, and have everyone fight, so that the country's future and human happiness can be guaranteed. Yu Bin analyzed the nature of the anti-communist war, saying: Today's duel between the two major camps in the world is regarded by some people in our country as an internal strife or a suppression of rebellion, which cannot encompass the nature of the war. The communist aggression is a very serious situation that threatens the current world and cannot be compared with the rebellions that have been commonplace in history.

### Mainland Industrialists Flock to Taiwan to Set Up Factories, Newly Added Nearly 70,000 Spindles in Textile Mills

[Central News Agency, Taipei 21st Dispatch] Mainland industrialists are increasingly coming to Taiwan to set up factories due to the abundant electricity supply in Taiwan Province, especially textile mills.

To the brave army and air force soldiers on the front lines of Xuzhou, Taiyuan, eastern Chahar, and eastern Shaanxi who are suppressing the rebellion:

Recently, with the victory in Xuzhou, the steadfast defense of Taiyuan, and the great victories in eastern Chahar and eastern Shaanxi, our brave soldiers on all fronts, with the revolutionary spirit of loving the country and loving the nation, have fought hard against the bandit army, annihilated the main force of the bandit army, and won brilliant victories. In particular, this decisive battle in Xuzhou has stabilized Xuzhou, Nanjing, and Shanghai, and consolidated the foundation of the country. Its significance is even more significant. These great victories have made the whole country and the world unanimously recognize that our National Revolutionary Army has always defended the motherland with its blood and maintained justice, and will never be succumbed to violence, nor will it be threatened by the international fifth column. Soldiers, this great achievement is deeply appreciated by the people of the whole country and admired by all those who uphold justice in the world. I would like to take this opportunity to express my most sincere and highest respect to all of you, national heroes and soldiers.

If we want to understand the meaning of suppressing the rebellion and the value of the sacrifices and struggles of all the soldiers, we must first understand the essence of this suppression war. The Communist bandits, under the instructions of the Third International, carried out a conspiracy to invade China, and after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, they first seized the Northeast, and then roamed and disturbed various places, and finally launched a full-scale rebellion. On the one hand, they spread insane propaganda, saying that our suppression war was an internal strife. In fact, the rebellion of the Communist bandits is a kind of aggressive war of the Third International against China. What is the basis for us to say that the rebellion of the Communist bandits is an aggressive war? It is because they endanger the territorial integrity and sovereignty of our country and endanger the independence and freedom of our nation. Take the Northeast as an example. The Communist bandits took the Third International as a cover to seize our resources. The Communist bandits took the red imperialists as a vanguard to occupy our land. Now the Northeast has become a red puppet state of Manchuria. If China is unfortunate, and the political power of the country falls into the hands of the Communist bandits, then our country will be ruled by the red imperialists, and our country will become a second Outer Mongolia. Therefore, the purpose of our suppressing the rebellion is to protect the integrity of the country's territory and sovereignty and to protect the nation's independence and freedom. In other words, our suppressing war is a national war against red aggression. Therefore, our suppressing is to resist aggression externally and to overthrow the traitors internally. All the soldiers who fight for the suppressing war are our most respected national heroes. We hope that all the soldiers on the front lines will use the spirit of winning the Anti-Japanese War in the past to win the victory in the suppressing war.

The conspiracy of the Third International is not only to communize China, but also to communize Asia, and even to communize the world. Therefore, our efforts to suppress the bandits should, on the one hand, unite the people of the whole country to fight for the protection of the country's national independence and freedom, and on the other hand, unite the countries and nations in the world that are harmed by the conspiracy of the Third International to fight against the aggression of red imperialism. The Second World War was when the anti-aggression countries in the world, under the United Front, defeated the aggression of the German, Japanese, and Italian fascists. Now the world's anti-aggression front has taken shape, and the prelude to the Third World War against aggression has also begun in Asia and Eastern Europe. We believe that the final victory will surely belong to those who are fighting to protect the survival and independence of the country and nation.

Based on the words we have said above, we can definitely tell you that the group of Chinese traitors and bandits, the so-called Chinese Communist Party, will never succeed in China. Their rebellion in China will eventually be suppressed. Please look at the history of the world, please look at the trends of modern times, any nation-state that fights to defend the motherland and resist direct or indirect aggression has not gained final victory and success. Our suppression of bandits today is a national war against aggression, so it must succeed in the end. We once won a glorious victory in the Anti-Japanese War, so the war to suppress bandits will surely win a glorious victory. As long as you recognize history, recognize the trends, strengthen your faith, and strengthen your struggle, the largest number of patriotic compatriots in the country and the largest number of people in the world who uphold justice are standing on the same line with you, determined to back you up. We dare to guarantee that this suppression war will surely succeed.

### Opinions on the Berlin Currency Issue, Soviet Reply Delivered to the Security Council, Western Powers May Submit Reply Today

[United Press Paris 21st Dispatch] It is reported that just as U.S. Secretary of State Marshall prepared to return home to report to President Truman, the Soviet Union seemed to have opened the door to resolving the Berlin dispute. Vyshinsky's main assistant, Teskovich, submitted the Soviet Union's reply on the Berlin currency issue to Argentinian Foreign Minister Bramuglia, the acting chairman of the Security Council, and the Western countries are expected to submit their reply on the 22nd. Although the details of the Soviet Union's reply have not been released, sources say that "the door to negotiations has been opened."

[United Press Berlin 21st Dispatch] The Soviet military-sponsored "Daily Review" stated today that as soon as the Western Allies accept the Soviet mark as the sole currency of Berlin, the Soviet Union can lift the "traffic restrictions" on Berlin. The newspaper said that the blockade would end simultaneously with the withdrawal of the marks illegally issued by the West. The newspaper put forward three suggestions for solving the German problem: (1) Conclude a German peace treaty; (2) Establish a German central government; (3) Withdraw all occupying forces. The British issued an official statement stating that the four powers originally agreed to use the Soviet head office mark as the sole currency of Berlin, but Soviet Military Governor Sokolovsky demanded that the Soviet Union completely control Berlin's trade and also demanded that the West accept Soviet traffic control, including air routes, so the four powers were prevented from forming an agreement.

### The Administrative Center of the Soviet Union

— Translated by Shi

The internal politics of the Soviet Union have not yet been fully understood by the people of the world. Therefore, the extent of Stalin's authority has become a mystery. Some speculate that Stalin is the true ruler of the Soviet Union, but President Truman doubts this conjecture, believing that Stalin is a captive of the Soviet administrative bureau. Some believe that Soviet administrative strategy is determined by the administrative bureau organized by thirteen Soviet political leaders, while others believe that Soviet administrative strategy is determined by the military authorities.

Because General Sokolovsky, the Soviet military commander in Germany, once disobeyed the treaties signed in Moscow by the three-nation diplomats and Stalin, some mistakenly believed that Soviet generals had the power to defy Stalin's orders. In reality, this is impossible. Not only can the military authorities not control Stalin and the administrative bureau, but the military authorities are also subject to the control of the administrative bureau and Stalin.

Stalin's position in the Soviet Union is that of a unique ruler; he now possesses two hundred million people and six million Soviet communists. The Soviet dictator is a product of the party apparatus. The administrative bureau is composed of thirteen Soviet political leaders, but it is not a cabinet; it is merely a branch of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. However, the national policy of the Soviet Union is mostly determined by this organization.

During public meetings held last year, we could often find Foreign Minister Molotov, Communist Party Secretary Zhdanov, and General Voroshilov sitting next to Head of State Stalin. Since Zhdanov's death this year, two new figures have been added next to Head of State Stalin at every meeting: Malenkov and Beria. It is very obvious who Head of State Stalin's most trusted figures are; we can see it at a glance from the meeting photos.

Within the administrative bureau, in addition to Head of State Stalin, there are three figures who are relatively the most authoritative: Molotov, Malenkov, and Beria. These three figures are sometimes referred to as the "Troika."

Molotov is the Soviet Foreign Minister and is the most well-known figure in the eyes of Western diplomats. He is an old friend of Stalin and has been working with Stalin for thirty-five years.

Malenkov is one of the administrative committee members and was formerly Stalin's personal secretary. He is forty-five years old this year. He has a particularly strong memory. Although he has never been abroad, he is very familiar with the industrial conditions of Europe, Asia, and America because he once served as the chairman of the wartime Soviet Heavy Industry Committee.

Beria is the commander of the Soviet Twenty Division Secret Police and the director of the Soviet prison camps. Relying on his organization, his power not only extends throughout the country but also expands to the Soviet satellite states and other regions.

The so-called "Troika" of the administrative bureau—Stalin's trusted figures—is not fixed. In other words, in order to test the abilities of the administrative bureau's committee members, all thirteen committee members of the administrative bureau have the potential to be regarded as trusted figures. The three figures mentioned above are currently the trusted figures in Stalin's mind.

The meetings and activities of the administrative bureau are very mysterious. The thirteen committee members of the administrative bureau often live in the Kremlin and do not often go out. High-ranking members of the Soviet Communist Party and specialized talents are sometimes summoned to the palace to participate in administrative bureau meetings and express their opinions, but this is merely an occasional occurrence.

The administrative bureau members are all promoted based on their own abilities. Before entering the administrative bureau, they have been repeatedly tested and have also been thoroughly monitored and examined by the secret police. They are all believers in Stalin. During administrative bureau meetings, these thirteen committee members are not all Stalin's "yes-men"; they all have the right to speak freely. Not only can they criticize national policy, the policies of the Communist Party, and others, but they can also sometimes argue with Stalin's suggestions. Whenever a matter is discussed, all thirteen committee members can express their opinions freely. If the debate becomes deadlocked, Head of State Stalin often makes the final decision. At that point, the discussion of the matter comes to an end. Even if you are not entirely satisfied with the decision on the matter, you must sacrifice your own opinions and implement the political strategy.

The decisions of the administrative bureau are not without errors, but when an error is discovered, a meeting is immediately held to change the strategy. The administrative bureau committee members are not like low-level party members who need to be familiar with Lenin's teachings; they are all realists. Stalin is nearly seventy years old. Who is his successor? It is possible that the "Troika" mentioned above will act on his behalf, but it is also very possible that Malenkov will directly inherit. The list of the thirteen leaders of the Soviet administrative bureau is as follows: Stalin, Molotov, Malenkov, Beria, Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Andreyev, Kaganovich, Khrushchev, Voznesensky, Shvernik, Bulganin, Kosygin.

### Our Representative Explains Stance on Resolving the Palestine Problem, Fully Supports Bernadotte Plan

[Central News Agency, Paris, 20th] Liu Chieh, our country's representative attending the UN General Assembly, delivered a speech in the UN Political Committee today, stating our country's position on the Palestine problem as follows: (1) China supports the eleven-point conclusions of the late United Nations Palestine mediator Bernadotte, which were recently re-submitted by acting mediator Bunche. (2) China supports the United Kingdom's new proposal to establish a Palestine "Reconciliation Committee." (3) China opposes "faits accomplis" created by force. (4) China supports the early return of nearly 500,000 Arab refugees to their original homes in Palestine. Mr. Liu pointed out that although China abstained from voting on the partitioning plan in November of last year, the current situation in Palestine has presented a new situation that requires renewed efforts in reconciliation. Mr. Liu also praised Bernadotte's conclusions, calling them "completely objective and generally fair and impartial." If Mr. Bernadotte's report can serve as the basis for a solution, the entire issue of territorial demarcation can be entrusted to the Reconciliation Committee, and it is hoped that the committee can strive to achieve an agreement between the Jewish and Arab sides. Liu Chieh concluded, "We hope that the Reconciliation Committee and the Arab and Jewish authorities can transform the current state of truce and armistice into a permanent peace next year and establish a new temple of friendship in the heart of the Holy Land."

[United Press, Paris, 20th] At the beginning of the committee debate, Britain requested the UN General Assembly to pass Bernadotte's recommendations, including the Jewish abandonment of the southern Negev, according to which Israel's territory would be reduced by about 60%. The United States agreed with Bernadotte's other recommendations but supported Israel's request to maintain the original plan. US Representative Jessup said that although the United States opposes ceding the Negev to the Arabs, believing that Israel's territory cannot be reduced without the full consent of the Jewish people, it also believes that it is necessary to continue to seek a way for both parties to reach an agreement and not to draw special boundaries at this time.

### UN Personnel Monitor Withdrawal of Egyptian and Israeli Troops

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 20th] United Nations trucks and jeeps, led by United Nations aircraft, entered Negev today to monitor the withdrawal of Israeli and Egyptian troops from the area.

### Dockworkers Postpone Strike, French Political Situation Tends to Ease

[United Press, Paris, 21st] The French political situation and labor unrest tended to subside on the 21st, with only the seven-week-long coal miners' strike still causing trouble. Dockworkers originally planned to strike on the 23rd, but the Communist union leader expressed willingness to reconsider and postpone the strike. This move was decided after lengthy talks with Public Works Minister Pineau. Dockworkers will meet next Wednesday to make a final vote. According to Prime Minister Queuille, he consulted with leaders of various parties in the cabinet all day, hoping to win a vote of confidence in Parliament on the afternoon of the 23rd.

### Parliament Passes Vote of Confidence for New Blatas Cabinet by Only Two Votes; General Observations Suggest its Lifespan May Not Be Long

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 21st] When the Greek Parliament held a vote of confidence this morning, the new coalition government of the Liberal Party and the People's Party passed by only two votes, 169 to 167. The leader of the opposition United Party, Canellopoulos, declared that the new government's lifespan would last no more than two months.

[United Press, Athens, 21st] The Greek Parliament passed a vote of confidence in the new Sophoulis cabinet by a vote of 168 to 167, a margin of only one vote. Sophoulis immediately stated that this one-vote majority was sufficient. However, former Prime Minister and current opposition leader Papandreou said that this one-vote majority was actually illegal and should be considered a vote of no confidence. He pointed out that according to the constitution, the government should receive more than half of the total number of votes of the members of parliament to be established. The parliament currently cast 335 votes, so at least 168 and a half votes were needed to obtain a vote of confidence. Moreover, during the vote, a pro-government member of parliament arrived late. Although the opposition protested vehemently, he was still allowed to vote, which further complicated the situation. Sophoulis was also unsure whether the member's vote gave the government a total of 168 or 169 votes, but claimed that the government had obtained a majority of votes and that there was no need to pursue the matter further. Political observers unanimously believe that if the government wants to secure its position, it must immediately expand its base and invite opposition parties to join the cabinet.

### US Senate Advisor Clark Advocates Full Military and Economic Aid to China

Piecing Together Aid is Insufficient to Improve China's Current Situation; Only by Giving China Greater Assistance Can the Communist Advance be Stopped.

[US News Service, Washington, 20th] According to a report released today by a Senate committee delegation, the United States must provide China with more economic and military aid if it wants to curb the advance of the Chinese Communists. This report, prepared by former Senator Clark, advisor to the Senate Appropriations Committee, outlines a five-point plan generally believed to be necessary to save China: (1) Immediate and extensive military assistance with artillery, aircraft, and bullets. (2) Assistance in the form of combat advisors. (3) Economic assistance in an amount sufficient to offset the majority of China's domestic budget for war expenditures. (4) Economic assistance to stabilize China's currency. (5) Strict American oversight of all expenditures under any Sino-American loan agreement. The report also strongly argues that "piecemeal aid" cannot save China from falling into the hands of the Communists, and states, "A comprehensive plan is required at this time." The Clark delegation was sent to China in October of this year by Senator Bridges, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee of the 80th Congress. Bridges has consistently advocated that the United States increase aid to China. Recently, in view of the critical situation in China, he suggested convening a special session of Congress to discuss this aid. However, President Truman recently stated at a press conference that a special session of Congress will not be convened and that any increase in aid to China must be considered in the 81st Congress, which will convene in January of next year. Bridges, a Republican, will no longer serve as chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the new Senate, where Democrats hold a majority. Clark's report includes China's social, economic, financial, and military needs, and states that these needs are "completely inseparable." The report states that this report is based on a large amount of reports and statistical material, as well as the results of discussions with American officials in China and with government, business, banking, and civilian leaders, and has been compiled accordingly. The report, in recommending extensive military assistance, pointed out China's "precarious supply situation," and pointed out the rapid deterioration of China's motorized transportation vehicles and the impending exhaustion of Japanese and American supplies received at the end of the war, "only the temporary assistance" being American surplus materials obtained through the China Executive Yuan's Materials Supply Bureau. The report further pointed out China's "precarious financial situation" due to the slow delivery of $125,000,000 in aid approved by the US Congress this year, which the Chinese government stipulated to be used for the purchase of military supplies. The report generally states that the current situation is "a situation of rapidly dwindling supplies," and that "the hope of no other replenishment except for extremely limited replenishment is now apparent." The report also states, "Only by increasing the authority of American advisors can these military deficiencies be remedied," and that the opinions of American military advisors may "eliminate unwise strategies, or may make victory replace failure." Regarding the issue of stabilizing China's economy, the report puts forward a three-point plan: The report states that a large amount of effective military assistance must first be considered in any financial plan, because "unless the imbalance of payments caused by the war no longer exists, there is no possibility of stabilizing China's currency or its economic situation." The report states: If the budget can be balanced, the United States can restore China's monetary credit through US dollar loans to China. The loan is to be used for stabilization preparation for a period of five years and can be extended. The loan shall not be less than 200 million US dollars. This gold reserve should be kept by the United States and its use should be limited to monetary reserves. The third point of the stabilization plan is a ten-year to twenty-year construction loan plan. Industries that have already been established but need to be completely or partially rebuilt can enjoy priority for this loan. The report listed the benefits of these various financial measures, believing that "once war expenditures cease, China will be in a favorable position to balance the budget, and the obstacles to stabilizing the currency can be eliminated. Once the currency gains widespread trust, it can stimulate various efforts. Coupled with financial assistance for industrial reconstruction, the increase in production and imports necessary for China's recovery can be easily achieved." The report then pointed out the contribution that a free and revived China could make to the world economy. China's import needs are very important to other parts of the world. Its exports, although greatly reduced due to government "freezing" and currency changes, are mostly goods needed by other countries, "and these materials cannot be obtained from other places." The report finally briefly outlined its five basic recommendations, acknowledging that this aid plan is "thorough and wide-ranging." The conclusion states: From the perspective of those who drafted the plan, "any action less than this plan cannot complete this task." (End)

### British Centenarian Dies, Aged 115

Worked as a Servant All Her Life and Had No Boyfriend

[United Press, St. Asaph, Wales, 20th] Ms. Hepworth, Britain's longest-lived star, passed away today at the age of 115.

### Deposits Exchanged for Gold and Silver Begin Today; Mint Rushes to Cast Gold Bars Day and Night

[Our Newspaper] Starting today, deposits exchanged for gold and silver will begin simultaneously in the seven major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. In Shanghai, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank, and the Central Bank's Business Bureau will handle the exchanges during business hours. Exchanges will be limited to gold bars and silver coins. The exchange of silver dollars will be limited to a minimum of one yuan and a maximum of forty-nine yuan, because fifty yuan in silver dollars can be exchanged for five mace of gold. The deposit and exchange of gold will start at half a tael, with unlimited supply. All deposit procedures will be completed at the same time as the exchange. Transactions will be limited to cash, and no negotiable instruments will be accepted, in accordance with the authorities' original intention to contract the currency. According to observations by relevant people, it is feared that there will still be more small households making exchanges in the future. In addition, the police bureau's original plan to investigate and detect gold banknotes has been abandoned due to changes in the authorities' policies.

[Another Report] The National Banks in nineteen locations, including Hangzhou and Wuhu, will begin exchanging on the first of next month. With few days remaining, the Central Mint has been ordered to rush to cast gold ingots and is working day and night so that they can be airlifted to various locations by the end of this month for preparation. As for the fineness of the gold bars, they are all 995.5. The serial number, fineness, and amount of gold are engraved on the front, and the words "Made by the Central Mint" are engraved on the back. The ten-tael gold bars are also engraved with ancient coins. According to the authorities, the Central Mint is currently stepping up arrangements, and after the machinery and equipment are organized, the production volume will greatly increase.

### National Bank Purchases Cotton Seeds to Prepare for Agricultural Loans Next Spring

In order to prepare for agricultural loans next year, the Central Bank recently entrusted the China Farmers Bank and the Central Cooperative Treasury to purchase 350,000 dan of high-quality cotton seeds from various cotton-producing areas. The Farmers Bank is responsible for purchasing 200,000 dan, and the Cooperative Treasury is responsible for purchasing 150,000 dan. The banks have now decided to first purchase in the cotton loan areas under their jurisdiction, and if the amount is insufficient, they will negotiate purchases from other cotton-producing areas.

Group A Football League: A Thrilling Situation; Jingwu Loses to Zhichao; China Aviation Forces a Draw with the Leader

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the Group A football league, there was one match in the morning and one in the afternoon yesterday, held at Yiyuan. In the morning, Jingwu declined after initial success, losing to Zhichao by a score of 2-3. Jingwu had scored two goals first, taking a 2-0 lead, but could not maintain this winning situation. In the first half, Zhichao tied the score to 2-2. In the last two minutes, Wu Qixiang scored a free kick, and Qian Yunqing scored the third goal, with Zhichao reversing the defeat to win 3-2. In the afternoon, the match between the Leading Team and the China Aviation Team ended in a draw. The Leading Team took the lead in the first half by scoring one goal, but in the second half, due to the goalkeeper being changed to a forward, Yan Chengkuan moved to the front line. Zou Ming panicked in the face of the attack, and Gao Xiuqing of China Aviation scored, tying the score. Before the end of the match, Yin Qingbing of China Aviation scored a goal, but Xu Zuguo dribbled the ball out of bounds, and Gao Xiuqing counter-claimed offside. The referee disallowed the goal, and the supporters of China Aviation protested vehemently, criticizing the referee, almost leading to an unpleasant situation. There were an estimated four to five thousand spectators at Yiyuan in the afternoon, which was quite lively. The details of the two matches are as follows:

Zhichao Scores One Goal, Narrowly Defeating Jingwu

In the match between Zhichao and Jingwu, both sides had offensive plays in the first half. After more than ten minutes of stalemate, Ma Qunxian of Jingwu received support from the rear, dribbled past the defense line, and scored a powerful shot near the goal, scoring the first goal. Jingwu's morale was greatly boosted, and the Zhichao goal was heavily defended. Ma Qunxian scored twice. Two minutes after the first goal, Zhichao conceded another goal. Afterwards, fortune turned for the better. Qian Yunqing received a pass from Huang Jingui and scored a goal, and Yunqing scored again, tying the score at 2-2 in the first half. In the second half, both sides had excellent opportunities, but failed to capitalize. In the last two minutes, Wu Qixiang took a penalty kick, sending the ball straight to the center, and Yunqing took the opportunity to deflect it in. Chen Huimin stood there as if turned to wood. Zhichao then powerfully defeated Jingwu 3-2.

Zhichao:

Sheng Peter, Lu Yide, Le Dequan, Zhu Chengjiu, Wu Qixiang, Yu Qiaxing, Zhu Jiaheng, Xu Guoping, Guan Yongchang (Huang Jingui), Qian Yunqing, Yan Tingzhang.

China Aviation and Leading Team Play to a Draw

In the match between China Aviation and the Leading Team, the Leading Team kicked off first, and there were back-and-forth plays. After ten minutes, Jin Chuan committed a foul outside the penalty area, and Jiang Kun took a free kick. The ball was fast and fierce, and China Aviation's goalkeeper Xu Fusheng barely managed to deflect it into a corner kick. Four minutes later, Jiang Kun took another corner kick, and Shi Dafa passed it to the left. Jiang Kun took a shot and it went into the net. China Aviation launched a counterattack, but it was unsuccessful. The Leading Team led 1-0 in the first half.

In the second half, the two teams played again, and the Leading Team's lineup changed, resulting in a big mistake. Goalkeeper Cheng Kuan took the position of forward, with Shao Ming taking his place. China Aviation launched a counterattack, and the attack was fierce. After more than twenty minutes, Gao Xiuqing made a solo raid. Wang Baoshan and Wu Kaimin rushed to defend, and goalkeeper Shao Ming rushed out anxiously, leaving an empty goal. Xiao Gao flicked the ball, and it flew into the net. After tying the score, both sides attacked each other, but there was no winner. Before the end of the match, Xu Zuguo of China Aviation advanced quickly along the side, dribbling the ball out of bounds. The referee did not notice, and the ball was passed in front of the goal. Yin Qingbing hooked the ball and it went into the net. However, Gao Xiuqing was too eager to win and had already sneaked into the net in an offside position. The referee ruled that the goal did not count. Afterwards, the two sides engaged in a back-and-forth battle, and the match ended in a 1-1 draw.

Leading Team:

Shao Ming (Zhou Chengkuan), Wu Kaimin, Zheng Bingyi, Li Chengxian, Wang Baoshan, Shi Dafa, Zhang Jingen, Jiang Kun, Yan Shufu (Xia Shufu), Chen Qin, Yao Qingsheng (Xia Shufu).

China Aviation:

The Mysterious City of Taiyuan

By Our Newspaper Reporter Guo Zhongshu

[Airmail from Taiyuan, 12th of the Month] In today's rapidly deteriorating situation in North China, the Battle of Taiyuan has attracted the attention of the entire nation and has even become an enigma. Taiyuan's troop strength and environment cannot compare to Shenyang, Jinzhou, or Jinan. Even the environment of Changchun, which has been besieged for seven or eight months, is far superior to that of Taiyuan. Changchun has two well-equipped and powerful armies, completely isolated, and has not even reached a year. However, the communist bandits cut off Taiyuan's external land transportation two years ago. In the bandit suppression war sequence, Datong District north of Yanguan is under the jurisdiction of General Fu Zuoyi, Linfen and Yuncheng Districts south of Hanhouling are under the command of General Hu Zongnan, and the area under the jurisdiction of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters is only a narrow strip of land stretching from Xinxian in the north to Jiexiu in the south, forming a "lone island in a red sea."

The Jinzhong Campaign

During the Jinzhong Campaign in the summer months of June, July, and August, all the counties and districts outside the Taiyuan urban area were lost, and the Taiyuan urban area became an incomplete isolated island. Only after the recapture of Shentangou and Yeyu on the mountainous edge of the west bank of the Fen River west of the city on September 8, was the threat to Taiyuan city lifted. The city periphery maintains 60 li to the north to Dahuangzhai Town, holds a stalemate with the bandits in the area 30 to 40 li from the city at the junction of Yangqu and Shouyang in the east, and the west and south of the urban area and the area 20 li south and west of the city south of Yeyu Dongru Old South Airport have been occupied by the bandits. The extent of the lack of manpower and material resources can easily be imagined, especially the food for the military and civilians, which relies solely on air transport for replenishment. Speaking of troop strength, since the restoration three years ago, except for the troops of the Second War Zone at that time, not a single soldier or pawn has been added by the government. Moreover, one division was sacrificed in Linfen, and one division is still garrisoned in Datong to this day. However, in terms of numbers and quotas, it cannot be said that there are too few. It should be known that these are troops exhausted from the Anti-Japanese War. During the Changzhi Campaign in southeastern Jin in the winter of the 24th year, they fought almost the entire strength of the communist bandits at that time, fighting with Peng Dehuai and Liu Bocheng, and lost about two-thirds of their entire strength. Since then, they have been fighting while replenishing, that is, replenishing in battle over the long years. After the main force of the communist bandits and our forces in the Fenyang Xiaoyi District were both severely damaged in a decisive battle this spring, the losses of the National Army in the Jinzhong Campaign here were the most severe. Therefore, officers and soldiers had to loudly ask the central government and the public for help. The air transport reinforcements that arrived were no more than a little less than one division. In the recent emergency situation of the Taiyuan offensive and defensive battle, the air transport reinforcements that arrived were even more limited.

The Banditry Assistance Never Ends

We know that the number of bandits has long reached more than 200,000, and the number of those killed and wounded by the National Army has reached a staggering number of more than 90,000. However, the bandits can constantly coerce the people to fill the cannon fodder and change bullets, and they can also transfer reinforcements from all directions at any time. We can say with certainty that the National Army is at an absolute disadvantage in terms of both manpower and material resources. Originally, in the battle of Datong last autumn, the fierce bandits finally collapsed after 45 days, and Xinxian also failed after 40 or 50 days. A small Yingxian was able to resolutely resist and was not captured by the bandits, and Linfen was lost after struggling for 75 days. Given the importance of Taiyuan and under the direct command of the supreme commander of the Taiyuan Pacification Zone, the battle results were not considered strange. However, in this one-sided North China shock, Taiyuan, which has been isolated and dangerous for the longest time and has extremely weak strength, has been able to avoid being affected by this shock wave. Even as of today, it can be regarded as uniquely capable of demonstrating outstanding battle achievements, promoting national prestige, boosting morale, inspiring the people, and contributing to the country. It is worthy of praise, and it is no wonder that it has won the attention and surprise of the entire country. The bandit suppression work in Taiyuan is due to its firm will and profound understanding. No matter how precarious the situation is, the people are always firm and consistent.

Purging the Puppet Regime

In Taiyuan, the work of purging the puppet regime has been carried out by the troops to the military posts and by the people to the neighborhood. Although it cannot be said that there is not a single communist disguised as a puppet, it is very difficult for them to hide for long. The "three-day work" of self-cleansing, self-defense, and self-government has been done very thoroughly. This time, the incident of Huang Qiaosong, the second Wu Huawen, was discovered in advance. Of course, it was due to the fact that his subordinates knew righteousness and knew integrity and reported him. However, Mr. Yan Xishan also made every effort to prevent the 30th Division. Mr. Yan treated the division with great generosity, granting them everything they asked for and even giving them what they did not ask for. Therefore, Huang Qiaosong alone could not have rebelled. Third, the integration of military, political, economic, and educational affairs. Outsiders say that Shanxi is special, and it is special because of the integration of military, political, economic, and educational affairs. Only with its integration can the implementation of the overall war be ensured.

Factories and Airports

In terms of economy, dozens of large-scale light and heavy industrial factories in Jin not only have every chimney smoking as usual, but also tens of thousands of employees are not only not slacking off, but are stepping up manufacturing under the artillery fire. In addition to supplying military use and people's daily necessities, there is also surplus capacity for external export. Large quantities of steel and other products are still being transported to the outside world by air as usual. Air transport has long become Taiyuan's only respirator. Originally, there were two airports built, one in the north and one in the south. During the Jinzhong Campaign, a new South Airport was built five li south of the city. After the Taiyuan War broke out, a new airport was rushed to build outside the East Gate, near the city. The evolution of the war has made all four airports ineffective, but a new airport has been built in the west of the city. This airport is currently providing breathing functions for the military and civilians of Taiyuan. This is another clear evidence of the firm confidence of the military and civilians of Taiyuan and the effectiveness of the overall war.

Numerous Bunkers

Fourth, there are numerous bunkers and solid fortifications. Some people think that bunker fortifications are static and combat is dynamic. This view is not without some justification, but in terms of guarding points, especially cities that must be guarded strategically and politically, bunker fortifications still have their undeniable value. The fact that the northern front of Taiyuan City can be stabilized, the east of the city and the advance and retreat of the mountainous areas in the north and south have a basis, and the main force has been fighting fiercely for more than a month, and the communist army has suffered 80,000 to 90,000 casualties. It can be said that a lot of the credit should be attributed to these densely packed steel-concrete bunkers, large and small. With the above-mentioned advantages, coupled with Mr. Ge Xishan's determination to "be buried in Taiyuan," it is possible to have Taiyuan's superior anti-bandit war record today, which is different from other major cities. However, the communist bandits are determined to capture Taiyuan. There have long been rumors that the communist bandits are preparing to make Taiyuan their "capital" and plan to convene a so-called "New Political Consultative Conference" in Taiyuan, using all possible military, civilian, and financial resources to capture Taiyuan. However, the military, civilian, and financial resources of the National Army in Taiyuan are limited, even if they are exhausted. How to reinforce troops and supply materials has become an urgent task that cannot be delayed, otherwise, even if you intend to provide assistance, you may feel that it is too late.

Zhangjiakou, the Oasis Beyond the Great Wall

By Our Newspaper Reporter Yue Zhan

[Airmail from Beiping, 17th of the Month] While viewing the red leaves in the Western Hills of Beiping, one can already see ice floating in the river in Zhangjiakou.

The first impression is always unfamiliar, but it is easy to see that this is a vibrant city. Their attitude towards life shows a seriousness towards work. Life is a very serious matter to them. They are not easily agitated, nor do they love extravagance. Women seem unaware of what lipstick is, and civil servants are all dressed in cotton clothes. A businessman wearing a greasy old sheepskin coat is considered wealthy. No one would dare to take a car to the cinema entrance. Such a simple city is indeed rare. People wearing suits and overcoats always feel uncomfortable here.

The World-Renowned Mushrooms

This simple style can be said to be a "local product," like the world-renowned mushrooms. Mushrooms are considered a rare delicacy once they leave Nankou, but they are nothing special locally. Zhangjiakou's mushrooms are sold all over the country, and everyone knows it. This product is produced in Chahar North and Inner Mongolia. Currently, Chahar North and Inner Mongolia are in turmoil, and the sources of all furs, livestock, and food have been cut off. Only this delicacy can continue to come because it is easy to carry and is not a necessity of life. There are more than 30 mushroom shops in Zhangjiakou. The best mushrooms sell for 48 yuan per catty, and the worst sell for 10 yuan per catty. Sales have been poor this year.

Dajingmen Cannot Bear the Vicissitudes of Time

The development of Zhangjiakou is based on trade with Outer Mongolia. It has had a golden age, but it is currently in recession. It is impossible to predict what will happen in the future. The historically famous location for Mongol-Han trade is Dajingmen, located in Zhangyuan Upper Town. It has now become a historical site. In the past, Mongolians brought cattle, sheep, and camels to exchange for cotton cloth, cigarettes, and tea. Now, batches of Mongolian refugees enter through this gate. Occasionally, a camel walks into Dajingmen, looking at the four characters "Great Rivers and Mountains" with sad little eyes, as well as the ancient Great Wall stretching on both sides, with the ruins of beacon towers on top. It must be filled with a sense of沧桑.

Currently, the number of Mongolian refugees who have fled to Zhangyuan has reached more than 800, most of whom are destitute and all need relief. In addition, there are more than 2,000 people scattered in various counties in Zhangbei. Mi Zhuodezhang Nongbu Ningbu, the 14-year-old little prince of Ujumqin Right Banner, also recently fled to Zhangyuan and transferred to Beiping on the 10th of this month. This little prince is very fond of Peking Opera.

Cultural Liberation

Zhangjiakou's culture is a bit like "liberated feet," and it can never get rid of its original appearance in terms of form and content. Ping Opera is the most popular in Zhangjiakou. When Mr. Fu Zuoyi returns to Zhangyuan, he also likes to go to listen to opera with his old comrades. Zhangjiakou's Fendou New Village and Fendou Middle School are the residences for the families of Mr. Fu's subordinates and schools for their children. They have a socialist color and a family-centric spirit. There are four newspapers in Zhangjiakou: Fendou Daily, Minsheng Daily, Commercial Daily, and Chahar Daily, with a total circulation of 5,600 copies. Zhangyuan has a population of 170,000, averaging one newspaper for every 30 people. Although Zhangjiakou's culture suffers from anemia, it is still an oasis in the desert wilderness.

A City with a Sense of Numbers

Zhangyuan is a city with a sense of numbers. Police Chief Yin Yanying told me many things as if counting family treasures: how many people, how many industries, how much movable property the people have, and how much immovable property. In the police station's two small rooms, there are statistics on everything about people and things, detailed and without omission. A chart shows that 90% of the 200 prostitutes are healthy.

A small matter can illustrate the completeness of Zhangyuan's organizational spirit. As soon as I got off the bus, the police were most concerned about me. They asked me where I planned to stay. After registering, military police visited me in the evening.

The White Lotus Sect's Legacy Spreads to Yiguandao

A Major Case Cracked in Southern Sichuan

[Airmail from Chengdu, the 20th] A large-scale organization called Yiguandao was recently cracked in Wutongqiao, southern Sichuan. A month ago, Chang Zhenzhong and Gao Heguang from Hebei entered Sichuan from Beiping and established altars in various parts of the province, recruiting young men and women and unemployed vagrants to join the sect. They went to Wutongqiao and used the operation of the Mingde Trading Company to promote Yiguandao. The sect's tenets falsely claim to promote the three cardinal guides and five constant virtues and entice young people to join the sect. The rituals are secret, and both men and women must swear naked oaths and pay huge membership fees. For a time, ignorant men and women and unemployed vagrants were deceived and flocked to it. Last month, the police station arrested the "sect leaders" Chang Zhenzhong, Gao Heguang, and Tian Zhi, and seized "Yiguandao Pulse Diagrams" and other related documents. After strict interrogation by the special commissioner, it was discovered that the sect purely inherited the legacy of the White Lotus Sect and had slogans suspected of inciting anti-rebellion and various bizarre symbols. The sect established branches in various places, and special personnel from Beiping came to guide them by plane, which shows the size of its organization. The special commissioner is currently investigating the case in detail and has reported it to the Sichuan Provincial Government for review.

The presidium included Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Zhao Zukang, Li Ximou, and other representatives from various sectors, totaling over a thousand people.

At this time of global unrest, aviation and air defense are extremely important. As this city is located on a plain, in terms of air defense, I believe that passively, we should popularize air defense knowledge and expand firefighting; actively, we should build a strong air force. Speaker Pan then gave a speech, believing that air defense should start from the active aspect, and the people should actively contribute to assisting the government in building the Air Force. In peacetime, there should be training and preparation.

### Second Phase of Jewelry Bond Charity Sale to Continue as Ordered by the Ministry of Finance; First Phase Lottery to Be Held Next Month on the 10th

It is reported that the China Trust Bureau submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to temporarily suspend the second phase of seized property jewelry bonds due to excessive price fluctuations. Recently, the bureau received a response from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the number of seized jewelry was very large, making public sale inconvenient, and bidding also had technical difficulties. It was still appropriate to continue issuing charity bonds to strengthen the settlement and assist the government in absorbing idle funds. Therefore, the Central Trust Bureau, the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearance Office, and the Central Savings Society have begun preparing for the issuance of the second phase. The bond design for the second phase is also being designed, and will be slightly different from the first phase. The face value of the second phase of charity bonds was originally set at one yuan per bond, but now, due to rising prices, a one-yuan face value is inevitably too low. According to reports, the face value may be increased to ten yuan per bond. However, this matter is being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval by the issuing authorities and is expected to be finalized within the month. The number of bonds issued will also be increased, and the issuance date may be in mid-next month.

In addition, the Central Trust Bureau will hold the lottery for the first phase of jewelry charity bonds on the original scheduled date, the 10th of next month.

In addition to strengthening the firefighting force, the department recently recruited dozens of fire policemen, established a perfect control room, and plans to purchase wireless command fire trucks. It will also loudly appeal to raise public awareness of fire disasters.

### Public Education Point Allotment; Purchase of Goods Expected This Week; Point Value to Be Adjusted

Starting this week, the bureau may separately notify various public education institutions to take their October allotment certificates to the designated locations for purchase. However, the bureau is still considering adjusting the allotment price. Because the Executive Yuan has recently decided to increase the salaries of public educators by five times according to the "819" plan, the corresponding point value may be increased from 25 cents to 50 cents per point.

### Municipal Teachers' Federation Sends Telegrams to the Two Houses Calling for Relief; Municipal Middle Schools Expected to Resume Teaching Today

[Our Newspaper Report] Municipal middle school teachers and staff can cancel their leave and resume teaching from today. Municipal primary schools are still awaiting a decision at a meeting this afternoon.

The Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Federation jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan yesterday, calling out that their lives were on the verge of hunger and cold, with no firewood or rice left, and they were in a state of anxiety all day long. In addition to asking the Legislative Yuan to insist on the original proposal passed on the 16th of this month to adjust the salaries of public educators and urging the Executive Yuan to implement it as soon as possible, they also asked the Executive Yuan to quickly implement it in accordance with the original proposal passed by the Legislative Yuan in order to relieve their distress and maintain education. The original telegram to the Executive Yuan is recorded as follows:

To Premier Weng and Deputy Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan, and to all the Executive Commissioners: Since the financial and economic reforms and the cancellation of price limits, prices have risen like wild horses out of control, rising day and night. Compared with the time of "8.19", they have risen by more than twenty times, while the salaries of us public educators have only been increased by half, and a month's income is only worth two or three bushels of white rice. This small amount is difficult for individuals to even have enough to eat, let alone support their families. We have been in the education sector for many years and have always had a spirit of dedication, sticking to our posts and striving to serve. Now, there is no firewood or rice left, and we are about to run out of food, and we are in a state of anxiety all day long. Fortunately, the members of the Legislative Yuan have seen this situation and decided on the 16th of this month to adjust the salaries of public educators, consulting the Executive Yuan for implementation, which shows their deep concern and gratitude. Although the adjustment plan cannot completely solve the problem of life, it can alleviate the difficulties. It is rumored that the Executive Yuan can only partially accept the plan and will formulate another plan for handling it. After reading it, the masses are extremely panicked. According to the current situation, we are already on the verge of hunger and cold. It is already incomprehensible that the Executive Yuan did not formulate a plan and adjust it before the resolution of the Legislative Yuan. It is even more incomprehensible that it did not fully accept it after the resolution of the Legislative Yuan was delivered, which violates the principle that the constitutional cabinet must be responsible to the Legislative Yuan. If this is delayed in such a manner, where will it place our lives? We hope that what is being reported is not accurate. We urgently hope that the Executive Yuan will implement it in accordance with the case as soon as possible in order to relieve our distress and maintain education. We are extremely anxious and awaiting orders.

### Over Ten Thousand Tons of Soviet Coal Arrive in Shanghai

Recently, more than 10,000 tons of Soviet coal have been transported to this city, and more than 30,000 tons will continue to be shipped to Shanghai one after another. The above-mentioned large amount of coal was purchased by the Shangban Coal Transport Association. In addition to Soviet coal, coal from Taiwan, Kailuan, and Huainan has also been ordered and is currently being transported.

In addition, the Public Utilities Bureau previously submitted a proposal to the Energy Conservation Movement Committee on energy conservation measures, implementing the "three go to one" movement. After the Energy Conservation Committee invited various relevant parties to exchange opinions, the Public Utilities Bureau revised it and resubmitted it to the committee. It is now known that because the source of coal has become smoother than before and the severity of the coal shortage has improved, the Public Utilities Bureau does not intend to implement the "three go to one" energy conservation measure. However, it hopes that citizens can still voluntarily conserve electricity to reduce the power generation load of the power company.
