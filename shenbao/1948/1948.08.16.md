### Hunter Discusses Impressions of Visit to China: Believes Military Aid More Important Than Economic Aid; Currency Reform Should Wait for Situation to Improve

[Central News Agency, Graham, Texas, 14th Dispatch] Hunter, a famous Far East trader and chairman of the board of Shanghai Wei Li Han Company, who recently returned from a visit to China, said at his residence here today: The general impression of this trip is that American aid arriving in China must be quickly and most effectively utilized. Hunter visited the East as the chairman of the Far East Subcommittee of the American Foreign Trade Committee for commercial inspection. He said that he is preparing to submit his report on trade in China to the American Foreign Trade Committee for discussion at the board meeting next month. Any recommendations that the committee may make in the future regarding Sino-American economic relations will affect American policy toward China, because the Foreign Trade Committee is the most powerful economic organization in the United States. In Hunter's view, the key to the current problems in China is not when the Chinese government can implement reforms, but how American military and economic assistance can be quickly and effectively utilized. He believes that military assistance is more important, saying that if the military situation can be improved, China's economic and social problems can gradually be brought back on track. He personally believes that, given the seriousness of the threat of Chinese communism, the American government will accelerate the implementation of its aid to China plan. Hunter believes that it is impractical for China to carry out currency reform before the military situation is significantly improved. Rather than issuing a new currency that still does not have the trust and support of the people, it is better to allow the legal currency to continue to depreciate during this period. Issuing new currency without sufficient reserves is tantamount to economic suicide.

### Certain Authoritative Person Discusses Reasons for Recent Price Surge

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] A certain authoritative person told reporters on the 15th that the recent sudden and dramatic surge in prices has had a very serious impact on people's livelihood and society. The next one or two months will be the most difficult period for our country's economy. At this time, American aid materials have not yet been effectively deployed and utilized, and many American aid materials have not yet arrived. Therefore, the economic difficulties can be said to have reached a . However, after this, American aid materials will come in continuously, and the economic difficulties can be improved compared to before. The authoritative person analyzed the reasons for the recent price surge in four points: (1) The mischief of idle funds, the financial institutions are rampant, causing idle funds to move in the market and stimulate the rise in prices. (2) The national banks have also failed to fulfill their responsibilities. (3) Gold and US dollars often lead the rise in prices. Gold and US dollars have become the target of speculation for idle funds. Taking June as an example, the black market price of US dollars is twice as high as the exchange settlement certificate, which shows that most buyers of US dollars are speculators, rather than engaging in promoting international trade. (4) The economic plan has been rumored for a long time, but it has not been announced and implemented, and speculators have slightly restrained themselves due to the rumors of the new economic plan. Now they see that the new plan has not been announced, so they have become active again. The authoritative person believes that if the government implements new financial policies, controls idle funds, and strengthens financial control, then prices can be expected to stabilize, so as to tide over the current economic difficulties.

The National Army will take this opportunity to clarify the situation in northern Henan. According to military intelligence, at 3:00 AM on the 13th, more than 1,000 bandits carried two cannons and invaded Qimen (northeast of Xinxiang). After the National Army counterattacked, they fled. Also, the main force of the 41st and 42nd Brigades of Chen's Bandit 14th Column, entrenched near Anyang, has recently passed through Caiyuan, Wuling, and Junxian and stirred towards the National Army control area. Their main force has already fled to Shadian, Liuwei, and Liyuantun. The area seems to have the intention of invading Jixian. Also, the 36th Division of Zhang Gonggan's unit, with three regiments of troops, and in cooperation with the local communists, is also stirring in the triangle area of ​​Yanchang. Their purpose seems to be to contain the National Army and respond to Chen's Bandit 14th Column. The National Army, which advanced eastward along the Xin-Yan Highway, reached Yanzhou Village on the 13th, and will join another National Army to the north on the 14th to bypass and enter the battlefield.

### The Ancient Bell of Hanshan Temple is Missing; Japanese Side Denies that Okuma Took it Away

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th Dispatch] After months of investigation, it is claimed that there is still no news of the bell that Okuma Shigenobu took away from Suzhou. Isano Yuzo, director of the Japanese Civil Affairs Bureau, has refuted the allegations made by the Buddhist Association through the Allied Headquarters. According to him, Okuma was born in 1839 and died in 1922 and never went to China. Okuma's grandson Nobu and Waseda University President Shimada Koichi also insisted on this. Therefore, it is believed that Okuma Shigenobu could not have taken the bell away. Isano Yuzo believes that the bell was indeed brought to Japan, but very early, or even possibly transported by antique dealers during the Song Dynasty. It is not known where it is currently hidden in Japan. Isano pointed out that when the Japanese Yamada visited Suzhou in 1898, he discovered that Hanshan Temple had become a ruin and the ancient bell was also missing. He then made a vow to rebuild the ancient temple and served as the deputy abbot of the temple for ten years to complete his wish. At that time, Yamada informed the Japanese Prime Minister Ito Hirobumi about the loss of the ancient bell. Ito then ordered a search for the bell throughout Japan. Later, in the spring of 1905, it was confirmed that the bell had already been washed into Japan, but it had already disappeared without a trace at that time. Ito then initiated the casting of another bell and presented the new bell to Hanshan Temple in 1910.

Editorial

### New Atmosphere in East Asia

The inaugural ceremony of the Republic of Korea was held solemnly in Seoul yesterday. General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces, and Liu Yuwan, our country's ambassador to Korea, both attended. The U.S. government simultaneously issued a statement temporarily recognizing the Korean government and appointing Macano as a special representative. Great Britain and Canada will also follow the U.S.'s lead and recognize the Korean government. The establishment of the new Korean government is not only a milestone in the Korean people's movement to restore their country and achieve unification, but also a new stage in the vigorous rise of nationalism in East Asia, which is of great significance. In particular, the new Korean government chose yesterday as its founding day, making August 15th even more of one of the greatest and most memorable days in East Asian history. Three years ago, Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration and formally announced its unconditional surrender, ending this unprecedentedly tragic war and igniting humanity's hope for peace and prosperity. In particular, the oppressed peoples of East Asia, encouraged by the defeat of the invaders, stood up to pursue freedom and demand liberation. Two years later, India was the first to achieve liberation, and India and Pakistan became twin countries in East Asia. Yesterday was their first anniversary, and in the northeast corner of Asia, the establishment of the Korean government brought double happiness to the door, which is even more worthy of the joy and celebration of the Asian people.

From a geographical perspective, Korea is strategically located between China, Japan, and the Soviet Union. It can be said to be a bridge between the Japanese archipelago and the Asian continent, and also a bridge between China and the Soviet Union. It is indeed a major cornerstone of peace and security in East Asia. However, in the past fifty years, Korea has suffered from Japanese aggression and persecution, leading to the loss of its nation until August 15th three years ago, when Japan surrendered unconditionally, and Korea was liberated from the clutches of Japanese imperialism. During the war, the major Allied powers successively issued the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration, guaranteeing Korea's freedom and independence. However, after the victory, Korea not only failed to immediately realize its desire for national restoration and unification, but its national destiny was also misled by power politics. The Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference in December 1945 decided that Korea would first be jointly administered by China, the United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union for five years, and then be allowed to become independent. Therefore, the northern and southern regions of Korea were occupied by the United States and the Soviet Union; and because of the different ideologies and conflicting interests of the United States and the Soviet Union, the division of Korea was further deepened, creating a situation of north-south division.

However, the division of Korea is not only a tragedy for the Korean people, but also a misfortune for East Asia. In view of this, the United Nations decided to first hold a separate general election in the U.S.-occupied area of southern Korea, convene a national assembly, formulate a democratic constitution, and elect a president and vice president. Then, in accordance with the provisions of the constitution, it would organize a new independent and democratic government of Korea, which was finally formally established yesterday. China and Korea are as close as brothers, and their relationship is as close as lips and teeth. In the past, China not only sympathized with the Korean independence movement, but also provided strong support without exception. During the Cairo Conference, our country's President Chiang's efforts to fight for Korea's independence and liberation were already known to the world. Now that the Korean government has been established, China is the first to recognize it in fact, giving it immediate international status. The United States naturally does not want to be left behind and also recognizes it. Now that the position of the new Korean government has been stabilized, it can take South Korea as the starting point for unifying the entire country. We will see Korea gradually unified and restored to its former glory, and we cannot help but rejoice for the future of East Asia.

Just as we are enthusiastically celebrating the establishment of the Korean government, we also happily celebrate the first anniversary of the new India. China and India are the two largest countries in Asia, not only with long histories and the oldest civilizations, but also with large populations and abundant resources. Moreover, between China and India, for thousands of years, there has been cultural exchange and no conflict of interest. Since the victory, the opinions of the representatives of China and India have always been consistent at any meeting of the United Nations. However, looking at the cultural exchange between China and India and the connection between the two countries today, we still cannot but think that it is not enough. We still have to double our efforts, especially the people of both sides should double their efforts to promote friendly relations between the two countries, work together hand in hand, and jointly seek a long-term plan for peace in East Asia. Indian Ambassador to China Panikkar also has the same feeling. In his letter to the Chinese people, in addition to expressing his cherishment of China's friendship, he firmly advocated that China and India work together side by side to ensure peace in Asia. We believe that this is by no means diplomatic rhetoric. Indeed, the full cooperation of the two major countries of China and India can bring together 800 million people, which is the most powerful guarantee for peace in Asia.

In short, pre-war Asia was a colony of Western powers. Now we see the scene of the vigorous rise of Asian nationalism. The new India has just celebrated its first anniversary, and the great Korea has also been born. The future of Asia is full of light, which makes us even more convinced that as long as the Republic of China, as the "elder brother," can strive for self-improvement and unite with the newly independent and democratic countries of Asia with a renewed spirit, to jointly seek peace and prosperity in Asia, then the bright future of East Asia can be fully realized one day.

### Breaking the Smuggling Stalemate on the Guangdong-Hong Kong Border Depends on the Implementation of the China-Hong Kong Anti-Smuggling Agreement: Song Ziwen Makes Decisive Negotiations with Hong Kong

[This newspaper, Guangzhou, 15th] According to Hong Kong news: Due to the Hong Kong side's delay in implementing the China-Hong Kong Anti-Smuggling Agreement, the public security on the Guangdong-Hong Kong border has also been greatly affected. For example, the Shark Pass incident occurred because the Communist bandits sheltered smugglers. According to Luo Qingxiang of the Anti-Smuggling Section of the General Customs Administration: If the agreement can be implemented, according to the agreement, customs anti-smuggling vessels can inspect ships entering and leaving the marked sea area near the Chinese coast in Ma Shi Bay. After the smuggled ships are seized and handed over to the Hong Kong authorities for determination as smuggled goods, they will be returned to our customs for confiscation or supplementary tax. In this way, the Chinese coast of Ma Shi Bay can be blocked, and the bandits on the shore will have no profit to ask for and will inevitably retreat. Therefore, the current anti-smuggling stalemate depends on the implementation of the agreement to break. It is believed that the current Chinese and Hong Kong authorities are actively discussing this agreement. After Chairman Song Ziwen returns to Guangdong, he will make decisive negotiations with Hong Kong. Luo's visit to Hong Kong this time may be related to this matter.

### Taiwan Brews Dispute over Japanese-Owned Houses: Provincial Government Plans to Recover Privately Owned Houses from Japanese, Tens of Thousands of Residents Fear Displacement

[This newspaper, Taipei, 15th] The brewing dispute over Japanese-owned houses in Taiwan is becoming more apparent. The crux of the problem is that the provincial government is encircling privately owned houses of Japanese people as public property. Part of this batch of houses has already been taken over by native Taiwanese and civil servants from other provinces who have signed leases with the Japanese Property Management Office. The provincial government then ordered the Japanese Property Management Office to cancel the leases as a prelude to recovery. Although this order has not been implemented yet, the encircled residents are generally very panicked, because once it is implemented, tens of thousands of people will be displaced. The reporter has visited government officials and local people in recent days. Government officials have decided to form a mediation committee to find a win-win solution. Local people believe that the so-called public property houses should be based on the original register of the Governor-General's Office, and privately owned houses of Japanese people should not be fabricated. Pu Xuefeng, the newly appointed Director of the Public Property Consolidation Committee of the provincial government, is studying new methods. Regarding the issue of the sale of Japanese property, Wu Chongquan, director of the Japanese Property Management Office, stated that the valuation will be based on the original shell, and the newly installed equipment will not be included. The order of sale will also depend on the application of the current residents.

### Reviving Rural China (Part 1) - A Record of a Conversation with Mr. Y.C. James Yen

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The disaster-stricken Chinese countryside, devastated by years of war, appears even more shattered. The collapse of the rural economy not only shakes the foundation of the entire social economy but also directly and indirectly wounds the nation's lifeline. The China Rural Reconstruction Joint Commission was thus established in response to the times. With a substantial amount of US aid, approximately $27.5 million, and full support from the government, combined with the talents of Chinese and American experts, success is foreseeable. In other words, the commission already possesses the three prerequisites for the success of any large-scale undertaking: financial resources, manpower, and political power. It is particularly important to point out here that the programs and plans to be implemented in the future were not formulated overnight, nor were they drafted by foreign experts in laboratories and libraries, but rather are the crystallization of the painstaking efforts of pioneers from all walks of life in our country who have been engaged in the rural reconstruction movement for the past thirty years.

Since the early years of the Republic, the Chinese people have begun to pay attention to the rural movement. Among the many leading experts, Mr. Y.C. James Yen, who founded the National Association of the Mass Education Movement and engaged in rural work in Ding County, is undoubtedly one of the most accomplished and internationally renowned figures. He currently serves as the Executive Director of the Rural Reconstruction Joint Commission. I recently had the opportunity to have a long conversation with Mr. Yen and have recorded its gist to share with readers:

The Education of Power - Mr. Yen is a scholar who values practicality. He believes that China's resources lie in the Chinese people, and that China's great latent power must be discovered from among the people. He said, looking around the world today, everything is subject to the strength or weakness of power. "The powerful rule, the powerless are enslaved!" Those with power dominate others, those without power can only be dominated. Only when the people unleash their own power can they become the masters of a democratic country, and only then can the country be said to be prosperous and strong. What is power? Knowledge is power, production is power, health is power, organization is power. Mr. Yen specifically pointed out that in order to discover the infinite power hidden among the hundreds of millions of farmers, and in order to address and solve the four shortcomings of Chinese farmers: "ignorance, poverty, weakness, and selfishness," the meaning of poverty and weakness is very clear and requires no explanation; ignorance is not innate, but is due to the lack of educational opportunities and the inability to express their talents and wisdom; selfishness is also not innate, but is due to the lack of organizations for collective empowerment. Since 1923, Mr. Yen and his comrades have advocated promoting "literacy education, livelihood education, health education, and civic education" in rural areas. In order to make the terms universally understandable, Mr. Yen also renamed the four types of education that rural construction relies on as the four educations of rural literacy, production, health, and organization, coordinating with each other, with the aim of tapping the latent great power of farmers. In short, the four educations together form a complete "education of power."

Literacy Education for Cultivating Knowledge Power; Literacy education includes both literacy education and art education. The former focuses on teaching ordinary people to read and acquire basic education. The Mass Education Movement has worked to promote literacy campaigns and has engaged in research and editing of textbooks and supplementary reading materials needed for poverty alleviation education, selecting some commonly used words and nouns to be used for teaching. With regard to art education, the Mass Education Movement has also been engaged in research and writing for many years, creating tools for art education and performing and demonstrating, using drama, storytelling, film, paintings, and radio broadcasts, music performances, to improve the artistic life of farmers, and sprinkle various common sense.

Production Education to Increase Rural Wealth; The content of production education roughly includes four aspects: first, agriculture, such as crop improvement, horticulture, livestock improvement, pest control, fertilizer application, etc.; second, economics, such as the organization of cooperative societies for production and marketing, credit loans, agricultural production methods, and rural economic systems; third, rural crafts, such as cotton and wool textiles, silk and tea production, agricultural tools, and all processing and manufacturing crafts, etc.; fourth, agricultural engineering, such as agricultural tool improvement, the application of mechanization, and the construction of farmland irrigation, etc. Mr. Yen particularly emphasized that the increase in farmers' own production is not enough to improve farmers' lives unless farmers are aware and enlightened and rise up to manage their own affairs? Such as cooperative organizations for agricultural product management and credit, sales, and marketing, in order to avoid exploitation by intermediate classes, farmers can directly obtain benefits, and gradually reform the entire rural economic system. Speaking of the issue of agricultural mechanization, Mr. Yen said: "When agricultural production increases, farmers' cooperation and management skills improve, and farmers have education and organization, etc., agricultural mechanization will be more powerful."

Health Education to Promote Strong Farmers; In order to promote farmers' hygiene and medical treatment of diseases, the Mass Education Movement has made a very important contribution, which is the creation of a new rural medical system. They established health centers and affiliated health stations in Ding County, and set up a number of health workers in villages and towns to undertake the task of farmers' medical and health care, which is the beginning of the health center system that was implemented before the war and is currently being implemented. Mr. Yen believes that in China today, where financial resources are scarce and medical talents are in short supply, preventing diseases in rural areas is even better than medical treatment. Some infectious diseases, such as smallpox, cholera, etc., can be prevented in advance, and the prevention of diseases should be promoted universally, and attention should be paid to the nutrition of farmers. Mr. Yen believes that agricultural products with rich nutritional value, such as soybeans, tomatoes, etc., can be encouraged to be planted more by the people, so as to increase their daily nutrition. Also, the completion of health education lies in spreading health knowledge to the people on the one hand, and cultivating healthy habits among the people on the other hand, both of which require the gradual guidance of rural movement work. Mr. Yen said: "To govern a village, we must first build the people," the ultimate goal of health education is to improve the "vitality" of the people, and only then will the countryside have the basic conditions for all construction.

### Forty Years of Struggle Finally Leads to Freedom The Korean Government Declares Its Establishment Syngman Rhee Delivers a Speech Willing to Extend a Hand of Friendship to the Soviet Union The US Transfers Power in Korea Today

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 15th] The government of the Republic of Korea was established today. President Syngman Rhee delivered a speech stating: Today, Korea has achieved independence, the culmination of forty years of Korean hope, dreams, struggle, and sacrifice. The Korean government hopes to maintain and promote the current friendly relations with all relevant countries, and even more hopes to establish friendly relations with governments with whom there has been no contact. The Chinese government temporarily recognized the Korean government on August 12th and therefore reiterates the close friendly relations between the two countries. For hundreds of years, the restoration of positive amity between China and Korea lies in this. The Soviet Union is our neighbor, and we wish to live peacefully and amicably with this great nation. We only ask that the Soviet Union allow us to live freely, and we ourselves hope that the Soviet Union will be able to do so as well. Once the Soviet Union has this intention, Korea will extend a hand of friendship. Rhee said: Today should be a day of national celebration, but looking towards the north, one cannot help but feel worried. The Korean people first appeal to the sense of justice of the Soviet people, and then to the conscience of the world, that is, all countries in the world, in order to maintain lasting peace, no matter how powerful a country is, it must not forcibly occupy the territory of its weaker neighbors. The establishment of Korea has six major principles: (1) absolute faith in democracy; (2) protection of the freedom of ordinary people, special classes, and individuals; (3) respect and protection of freedom, and grasp of its inherent value; (4) tolerance and cooperation as the way to govern the country; (5) determination to do everything possible to improve the living conditions of the poor; (6) the need for foreign economic assistance. Rhee went on to warn Koreans who were dissatisfied with the status quo, whether communists or not, that they must not overthrow the government. He said: The Korean people enjoy many freedoms and rights, but they do not have the right to subvert or attempt to overthrow the government.

### Soviet Troops Gather on Southern Border To Overthrow Tito Ready to Take Action Economic Sanctions Cannot Be Effective Will Use Force

[French News Agency, London, 14th] According to the special correspondent of the Observer, the movement of Soviet troops on the Yugoslav border will be a precursor to the mutual defamation in the South Soviet conflict, and the Soviet Union is now preparing to take action after the end of the Danube Conference. It is reported that in the past six weeks, a total of 15 divisions of Soviet troops have been transferred to the border between Romania, Hungary, and Yugoslavia, and the latest fighter jets have been gathered in Outer Transylvania and Outer Transdanubia. At the same time, a large number of reservists have been conscripted into the army, and foreign troops against Tito have been recruited in Hungary. The Soviet Union does not want to deal with Tito anymore, but wants to overthrow his regime. The Soviet Union seems to be implementing economic sanctions first, and an informal oil blockade has already been implemented. If it cannot be effective, it plans to use force.

[United Press, Trieste Port, 15th] Italian authorities announced that they will begin excavating the mass grave in the Karst foothills next week.

### US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett Rejects Three Soviet Protests US Senators Advocate Temporarily Prohibiting Soviet Consulate Officials from Leaving the US

[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] The United States today rejected the third protest filed by the Soviet Union regarding the Gouzenko incident. Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin and US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett, during a lengthy discussion, protested the violation of the extraterritorial rights of the Soviet consulate in New York by US police, because the latter had sent Gouzenko, who jumped from the fourth floor to escape imprisonment, to the hospital. Lovett only allowed for official information to be sought on this point. The Soviet ambassador made three demands today: (1) Soviet guards should guard the hospital day and night; (2) Gouzenko should be transferred from the hospital to a place controlled by the Soviet Union; (3) police should be instructed not to interfere with the duties of Soviet Consul General Lomakin and should be allowed to visit the hospital. Lovett firmly rejected this request.

[United Press, New York, 14th] New York senators on the 14th requested the federal government to ensure that all officials and attendants at the Soviet Consulate General in New York City are not allowed to leave the United States until the authorities decide whether the Gouzenko case contains criminal acts. Shortly after Congressman O'Boyle subpoenaed him to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee, he telegraphed Secretary of State Marshall, requesting that Marshall not allow consulate officials to leave the United States until "the authorities of New York City, New York State, and the Department of Justice have determined whether Soviet Consul General Lomakin and his subordinates have committed criminal acts in the Gouzenko case."

### Testimony of US Espionage Case Witness Is Problematic

Many Contradictions After Confrontation

[United Press, Washington, 14th] Investigators in the House of Representatives on the communist espionage case said on the 14th that half of the Soviet espionage organization case depends on one person, the questionable meaning of the word, "and we don't know who is lying," the editor of the grade, who had joined the Communist Party and has since confessed. Zhang told the Congressional Committee about the work of underground communists among Federal government personnel in Washington before 1937. The other half of the case depends on the testimony of Miss Bentley, who said that she was the transmitter of this espionage organization during the war. Zhang swore an oath in the House Un-American Activities Committee and pointed out that Hiss was one of the mainstays of this item. Hiss was formerly a State Department official and made great contributions to the founding of the United Nations. Hiss also swore an oath in the Talk Committee, denying each point of Zhang's accusation. He stated clearly that he did not know Zhang Bosi, "As far as I know, I have never seen this person." Investigators who did not want to disclose their names made it clear that they were having difficulty with contradictory testimony.

### Stalin's Successor: Still a Major Secret

— By Middleton

Differing Circumstances from Past to Present

Zhdanov's power within the Party was such that some political figures in the Soviet Union, recalling Stalin's rise to power, considered him to be the most favored successor. However, since Stalin succeeded Lenin and eliminated Trotsky, the situation has changed. In the past, the Communist Party was the only powerful group in this young nation. Today, although this group's strength remains substantial, it is countered by security agencies and governmental factions comprising bureaucrats and the military.

For example, Beria can boast of twenty divisions of state secret troops and numerous plainclothes agents, but the question remains: are these individuals loyal to their organization and its leaders, or to the Party?

Marshal Bulganin can tout the accomplishments of the army in World War II, an army that envies the Communist Party and security agencies. However, the latter two have merged since the war to limit the power of wartime generals and weaken their influence in the government.

Recently, the power of the government faction has greatly increased. It includes not only general ministries like the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry, but also penetrates other major industrial sectors. As a result, its influence extends beyond administrative personnel to include technicians, engineers, and experts who can be called upon for economic planning. It seems that the importance of national planning is even greater than that of the military, the Party, and the security agencies. The expansion of all three groups—the military, the government, and security—has created a situation where, although the Party fostered their growth, they are no longer controlled by it.

Fortune Changes Constantly

Currently, various factions vying for the leadership position held by Stalin maintain a precarious balance. Within the atmosphere of the Kremlin in this empire, the competition for dominance ebbs and flows. Meanwhile, Stalin remains aloof and above it all.

Although Stalin's work in Moscow is said to be as lengthy and arduous as in the past, it is said that he participates less in the debates of the Politburo. He merely listens to each person's statements and, finally, concludes with very few words.

He seems more humane and approachable than Molotov. This leads Westerners to believe that everything might progress more if they could negotiate directly with Stalin.

In the past, no one had such authority. When the Soviet Union was under pressure, Stalin could make the necessary concessions; only he could do so without criticism. But when devoted to the doctrines of Communism, he was as ruthless and steadfast as Molotov.

In the Soviet Union, Stalin is a semi-deified figure. He is the hero of poems and stories, and the exaggerated praise for him would make even the despotic emperors of Persia blush with shame. His portrait hangs in the tents of Mongolian cavalrymen, on the walls of apartment buildings in Leningrad, and in the farmhouses of Ukrainian peasants.

"Odes" in Poetry

The hanging pictures vary with the setting. In the ethnically diverse Soviet Union, each ethnic group views Stalin as its own idol. Thus, when Kazakhs hang huge portraits at art exhibitions, it is easy to see that the leader's traits are imbued with many Kazakh characteristics. The banners of the Central Asian republics read: "The odes of all the tribes contain the name of Stalin." The speeches of representatives in front of the Supreme Soviet always include the mystical syllables of Stalin's name.

Countless Soviet people believe that Stalin is the most intelligent and omnipotent; he is the creator of victory, the engineer of the new Russia, the maker and interpreter of doctrine, and the father of all Soviet people. His death will leave not only a power vacuum but also a vacuum of idol worship.

The main problem of succession is whether the question of succession can be decided secretly by the Congress. If this is possible, superficial unity can be maintained; otherwise, unity will be broken. Stalin could solve the succession problem in two days by appointing one person as his successor to continue in the most important positions currently held. Otherwise, he will leave the great power of the government to the four-cornered competition of Molotov, Zhdanov, Beria, and Bulganin.

Conflict is Inevitable

Looking at the political power at stake, the struggle to seize this power seems unavoidable. However, this struggle does not necessarily have to wait until Stalin's death; it may erupt within this group of ministers. This struggle, which has been instilled into all Party members for thirty years, may be applied in the Kremlin.

If this struggle does not occur, the new situation will inevitably endanger the future economy of the Soviet Union and its position in the world. In the Soviet Union, no institution can change the Soviet government or simultaneously satisfy two or three opposing groups. If it worsens, the struggle for power may escalate into a civil war, eventually derailing the country's economy and social life.

In the midst of a nationwide struggle, Beria, who controls the security agencies, has the most favorable prospects. If decided by Congress, then Molotov and Zhdanov would be the most prominent candidates. (To be continued)

### Soviet Newspapers Reveal: American Spy Case Cracked

No Detention at the Time

[United Press, Moscow, 15th] Soviet newspapers on the 15th made no mention of the development of American espionage against communist spies, but reported that several months ago, the American military attaché in the Soviet Union was caught red-handed engaging in sabotage and expelled from the country. The report stated that American attaché Lieutenant Tracy Hall obtained "secret" information from a Soviet customs official, but "the two were discovered on April 23 by senior customs officials and security officers, both looking horrified. They were interrogated, and notebooks and documents in English and Russian were found. At that time, one of the unidentified persons suddenly attacked a security officer, attempting to seize the documents, but failed. The notebooks contained extremely secret information, and the unidentified person was Tracy Hall." Hall directly admitted to obtaining information from the customs official, and the customs official confirmed his statement. The Soviet side then requested the American embassy to immediately expel Hall back to his home country, which the American embassy quickly complied with, without saying a word about the crime. The American embassy acknowledged on the 15th that Hall had worked here.

### City's Financial Situation Extremely Difficult; Employee Subsidies Exceed 2 Trillion; Efforts to Make Up for Deficit

[Reported by this newspaper] The city's finances are currently experiencing extreme difficulties. A person in charge of the Municipal Finance Bureau announced yesterday that the monthly living subsidy will be calculated at 1.6 million times the base amount, totaling over 2.5 trillion yuan. Despite the extreme financial difficulties, it has been decided to start issuing the subsidy on the 17th of this month. However, there is a significant shortfall in the current tax revenue needed to cover this expenditure. The deficit will be made up through other means, with three sources: (1) Taxes due for the current month or quarter will be strictly enforced for payment. In addition, taxes collected on behalf of the city by other agencies, such as dock duties, have been notified to be paid in advance. (2) The collection of the municipal construction surtax on public utilities for the current month will be expedited, and the payment of arrears will be ordered. (3) Although the above two measures can cover most of the deficit, the remaining shortfall of at least 500-600 billion yuan will be temporarily borrowed to make up the difference. The person in charge also stated that no matter how difficult the city's finances are, the financial authorities will do everything possible to ensure that municipal funds are disbursed in a timely manner. However, the fundamental solution lies in thorough reorganization and the establishment of an autonomous financial system, which is currently under careful study.

### Workers at Cigarette Factory Request Mediation of Dismissal Dispute

[Reported by this newspaper] A dismissal dispute recently occurred at the Da Zhonghua Cigarette Factory on Weihaiwei Road. It began when Liu Guiying, a female worker in the tobacco leaf department of the factory, was elected as a preparatory member when the factory's workers participated in the organization of the Municipal Cigarette Workers' Union. After the Municipal Cigarette Workers' Union was officially established on the 12th of this month, the factory suddenly dismissed Liu on the grounds that her leaf cutting did not comply with regulations. Upon hearing this news, the factory workers felt deeply dissatisfied and submitted a petition to the Municipal Cigarette Workers' Welfare Committee yesterday, requesting the committee to send personnel to mediate the matter so that Liu could resume her work as soon as possible.

### Handling Increased Capital of Traitorous Stocks: Clearing Office Decides on Four Principles

According to information from the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office, the number of stocks received and seized from various traitors by the office is extremely large, categorized by type. At a time when the currency is depreciating daily, the companies to which these stocks belong are all applying to the Ministry of Finance for approval to increase their capital. The companies are paying close attention to the issue of increasing the capital of the stocks seized from various traitors, fearing that improper handling may lead to future disputes. After careful discussion, the Clearing Office has recently decided on several principles: (1) In principle, the right to increase the value of traitorous shares in various enterprises should be retained. However, if the total value of traitorous shares is less than 20% of the total paid-up capital of the enterprise, and the amount of increased capital to be paid is more than 5 million yuan, in addition to using all the previous period's dividends and interest due to the traitorous shares to pay for the increased capital, the shortfall should be forfeited to avoid reducing the income from traitorous assets and increasing the burden on the national treasury. (2) If traitorous shares account for more than 20% of the total paid-up capital of various enterprises, and the business situation of the enterprise is good, the office may pay for the increased capital shares in proportion to the original shares of the traitorous shares. (3) Stocks or increased shares of various enterprises will be obtained in accordance with the methods decided by the shareholders' meeting of the enterprise. (4) If traitorous shares account for less than 20% of the total paid-up capital of various enterprises, and the amount of increased capital to be paid is less than 5 million yuan, and the business situation is not good, the amount of the previous period's dividends and interest due to the traitorous shares may be used to pay for the new shares, and the shortfall shall be raised jointly by the enterprise and external sources.

### Mr. Xu Maotang's Family Has a Goose with Special Intelligence: Greets Guests, Welcomes the Host, Protects Chickens, Chases Away Cats; Unruly, Only Afraid of the Cook

[Reported by this newspaper] Among small animals, cats and dogs are known to possess special intelligence, but it is rare to see chickens and geese that are different from the ordinary. The family of Mr. Xu Maotang, the general manager of the Zhonghui Bank in this city (wrongly identified as Xu Guomao in the "Gems of Chinese Literature" picture in the previous issue of this newspaper), has a goose that is completely different in disposition from ordinary poultry. Mr. Xu purchased the goose from the countryside seven years ago. At the time of purchase, there were a total of four, but the other three died one after another shortly after, leaving this goose alone. Subsequently, after a long period of solitary life, it seemed unwilling to submit and gradually encroached on the duties of the cats and dogs in the Xu family. When a guest arrives, it immediately raises its head and crows loudly. When Mr. Xu returns home from outside, it also follows closely, swaying and pursuing. If the Xu family's servants or friends leave food in the kitchen, it will jump and peck, obstructing them in every way. Although there are many cats and dogs in the Xu family, they know that they are no match for its immense strength, so they can only do nothing. This year, the goose became extremely intimate with a rooster raised by Mr. Xu. When Mr. Xu hatched several chicks in March and April, the goose took on the demeanor of a family elder, always tasting the food itself before the chicks. After the chicks finished eating, it would then eat the leftovers. If it saw a stray cat prowling around, it would fight bravely and defend the chicken flock. In the morning and evening, when the group of chickens and chicks entered and left the nest, it would always supervise from the rear, driving them one by one with its long neck to the ground, ensuring that the rooster and chicks acted uniformly under its command before it would stop. This goose is usually quite unruly, but when it sees the Xu family's cook appear, it immediately bows its head and dares not move. When asked, the servants of the Xu family all said: "Perhaps the chief cook has a bit of a murderous aura!"

### Mayor to Convene Meeting Today to Persuade Public Utilities to Accept Price Reduction Plan

The attitude of the Shanghai Power Company will depend on the decision of the company's general manager, Huo Pusijin, after he rushes back here from Qingdao. Huo arrived in Shanghai yesterday. All companies will hold a joint meeting this morning to exchange views in preparation for the mayor's persuasion meeting on price reductions this afternoon.

Review Committee Members Express Satisfaction

The Shanghai Cost of Living Index Review Committee held its 16th meeting at the Municipal Government at 9:00 AM yesterday. Zhang Zongmeng, Director of Statistics for the Municipal Government, reported on the price increases: the price situation was relatively stable in the first three periods, but the last period saw a more dramatic increase. Items with increases below 30% include bean curd sheets, salt, tea, matches, soap, and straw paper. Items with increases between 31% and 40% include soybeans, flannel, soy sauce, and "士林" cloth. Items with increases between 41% and 50% include bean sprouts, coarse cloth, fine cloth, "花標" cloth, woolen cloth, thread, flour, pork, beef, and greens. Items with increases between 51% and 60% include cabbage and bleached cloth. Items with increases between 61% and 70% include indica rice and rapeseed. Items with increases between 71% and 80% include corn and firewood. Items with increases between 91% and 100% include haircuts and cigarettes. Items with increases above 100% include rationed sugar, rationed rice, electricity, and trams. After careful review by the committee members, they expressed satisfaction, signed the index forms, and adjourned the meeting at 10:40 AM.

Dramatic Rise in a Few Prices Has Little Impact on Index

Chairman Zhang Zongmeng told reporters after the meeting: Some people outside are speculating on the overall index based on the prices of a few items, but this view is actually wrong. The worker index includes about 50 items, and the staff index includes about 90 items. If the prices of three or five items rise sharply while the prices of other items remain stable, the average figure will have little impact on the index. For example, in public utilities, only water, electricity, and transportation affect the index. Although gas and telephone rates have risen sharply, they are not included in the index calculation.

### Methods for Distinguishing Genuine and Fake American Currency

[Our Report] The American military authorities in this city have recently received notification from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the identification of genuine and fake American currency. For $20 bills, in addition to the paper, printing, and patterns being completely identical to the genuine ones, the only difference lies in the word "States" under the signature of the Treasurer of the United States on the lower left corner of the front. The first "t" in "States" is missing a stroke, forming an "i". Besides the $20 bill, there is also a $50 bill. In addition to being completely identical to the genuine one, the only flaw is that there is a missing dot at the front end of the signature of the Secretary of the Treasury.

### Scalpers Run Rampant, Drunk Man Killed by a Punch

[Our Report] Luo Yingju, a 21-year-old Cantonese man from Xiamen Road No. 63, who made a living by scalping silver dollars, was on Huangpi North Road when he was approached by Liu Miaofa (25 years old, a laborer, residing at Xinping Lane No. 11 and a half, Longmen Road). Liu, who was drunk, asked Luo about the market price of silver dollars that day. Luo replied that they were selling for 710 "葛元" per dollar. Liu argued that the price was too high, and a conflict ensued, leading to a fight. Liu was no match for Luo and tried to escape, but Luo pursued him relentlessly. When they reached the intersection of Huangpi North Road and Jiangyin Road, Luo finally caught up with Liu and the fight resumed. Unexpectedly, Luo struck Liu in a vital spot with a punch, and Liu immediately fell to the ground and died. The assailant was apprehended by nearby street police and taken to the New City Police Station for punishment.

### Mei Lin Canned Foods Extensively Exported After the War, Yesterday's Reception for Reporters to Visit the Factory

[Our Report] Mei Lin Canned Food Factory in this city hosted newspaper reporters yesterday to visit the factory on Hongqiao Road.

Canned foods, before and after the war, due to the large-scale import of various canned rations for the U.S. military, left a deep impression on people. However, the canned food manufacturing industry is still a rare phenomenon in our country. Before the war, there was the Taifeng Company, but its business failed and is no longer heard of. Today, the only canned food manufacturing factory in our country that is somewhat large-scale is Mei Lin.

A canned food manufacturing factory is like a large kitchen for society. After various foods are processed, it not only makes it convenient for diners to enjoy them without cooking, but also extends the life of seasonal foods and expands the scope of regional food flavors. There is nothing particularly noteworthy about the manufacturing process. Mei Lin produces meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, etc. These foods are flavored and boiled in large stainless steel pots, then sealed in cans. When sealing the cans, the can lid is fused to the can opening with a rubber band under high heat generated by a high-pressure machine. Then, it is placed in a steamer to heat, causing the air inside the can to expand and escape through the micropores of the rubber. After taking it out and cooling, it can be stored for a long time.

Mei Lin was founded in January 1933, purchasing dozens of acres of land on Hongqiao Road to build its own factory buildings and purchasing steamers, sorters, can-making machines, etc. from abroad. The scale was roughly established, but unfortunately, it has been greatly hindered by the war and the general situation after the war in recent years. The factory currently has over a hundred workers. In addition to canned foods, it also produces tomato sauce, chili sauce, soda, etc.

It is worth mentioning that the factory's products began to be exported to Southeast Asia and the Americas starting in 1939. During the Anti-Japanese War, when the concessions were occupied, the food needed by the British and American foreigners in the camps was supplied by the company. After the war, the overseas market recovered, and the company's products were exported in large quantities. Water chestnuts, green peas, and loquats are very popular in the Americas. In 1948, it earned over US$70,000 in foreign exchange. In order to manufacture tomato sauce and canned green peas, the factory specially purchased seeds from the United States and distributed them to farmers in the Hongqiao area to plant, and then the factory purchased them. This not only promotes domestic production but also benefits rural areas. In addition to the main factory on Hongqiao Road, there are branch factories in Tanglou and Chongming. The former specializes in producing loquats, cherries, and braised bamboo shoots, while the latter packages anchovies and jade fish. Recently, it is also planning to establish a branch factory in Taiwan, specializing in the production of local specialty vegetables and pineapples for export to the Americas. In 1946, the factory sent an engineer to the United States to study can-making technology, and he will soon complete his studies and return to China. With continued efforts to improve, it may create a new brilliance for China's canned food manufacturing industry.

### High Salt Prices Affect People's Livelihood, Merchants Hope for Loans for Transportation and Sales

After the Shanghai Salt Loan Syndicate was ordered to suspend operations, the funding for transporters was disrupted, indirectly affecting salt prices. Currently, the wholesale price of Zhejiang-Shanghai salt has reached over 9 million yuan per bundle, and in the Xubu area, it has even reached over 15 million yuan. If measures are not taken to improve the situation, it will have a huge impact on people's livelihood. Some believe that the rise in salt prices is a natural trend of general price fluctuations, especially due to the sharp increase in transportation costs and the rising cost of hemp bags. However, according to people close to the transporters, the actual factors are not entirely the case. The rise in salt prices is actually closely related to the suspension of the loan syndicate. Looking back at the past two years, the China Bank's leadership in the salt loan syndicate was relatively smooth. The method used was to provide loans based on pledges, with the amount of the loan determined by the quantity of goods transported. The interests of all borrowers were equal, with no distinction between old and new, large and small. After the suspension, transporters with sufficient funds can continue to operate as before and can use other means to obtain other loans, while smaller ones are stretched thin and are inevitably eliminated. The result is: (1) a shortage of wholesale salt in the sales areas, leading to rising prices, threatening both military and civilian supplies. (2) Stagnation in the production areas, with funds unable to circulate, affecting reproduction, making life difficult for salt workers, and reducing tax revenue. (3) In production areas adjacent to bandit areas, the security of materials is a concern. In order to encourage salt production, the Four Joint Office approved a total of 1.3 trillion yuan in salt production loans under the national policy loan program this spring, to be underwritten by the National Bank as a transfer pledge. The program, which was previously concentrated in Shanghai, was transferred to Zhejiang, Fujian, Qingdao, etc. due to the cancellation of the syndicate, with the Bank of China designated as the representative bank for the Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian regions, and the Bank of Communications as the representative bank for the Qingdao region. However, current costs have increased again, and the loan amount has not been adjusted, which is far from the actual situation. As for transportation and sales loans, since the end of the syndicate last month, each bank has handled them as business loans, providing discretionary amounts, but the transfer pledge procedure has not yet been agreed upon, and the amount of loans disbursed so far is small. It is also learned that the National Bank's Discount Committee passed a resolution on the 9th of this month regarding the Salt Affairs Bureau's allocation and transportation of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Henan salt, as well as Xubu Huai salt transportation and sales transfer pledges, to be negotiated by the bank's business bureau with various banks to determine the loan amount and method. With the peak season for transportation and sales approaching and a lack of funds, transporters generally hope that this method will be implemented quickly.

### Broker Commits Suicide in Shanghai Hotel Due to Debt

A tragic suicide by poisoning occurred in Room 420 of the Great Shanghai Hotel on Tianjin Road a few days ago. Bi Yongchang, a Ningbo native who worked as an industrial raw material broker, died on the spot. The police station in charge has sent the body to the Changde Road Morgue for examination yesterday. Bi Yongchang, 31 years old, was engaged in the business of industrial raw materials. Bi had a wife and a concubine. In June of this year, Bi sold 200 bags of table salt in a transaction, paying out 160 bags at the time and owing 40 bags. Recently, due to rising prices, he was unable to deliver the goods and went into hiding at the Hexing Inn No. 80, Zhongzheng East Road. He was eventually found by the buyer, who demanded that he pay the owed goods. Bi, forced into a corner, had a sudden thought and sneaked into the Great Shanghai Hotel on Tianjin Road a few days ago and swallowed poison to commit suicide.

### Longhua Bloodshed: Laundry Girl Stabbed to Death, Suspected Traffic Police Officer Fleeing

[Our Report] Chen Afu, a local, lived with his wife and daughter in a shack at No. 40, West Gate Road, Longhua Town Aircraft Field. Chen was unemployed, relying on his wife and daughter to do laundry for others to make a living. His daughter, Sanmei, who was already 18 years old, had a relationship with Zhu Jinfa, a traffic police officer from the nearby Traffic Police Brigade, due to her laundry work. Zhu also tried his best to introduce laundry work to her, so Chen's wife and daughter were quite busy. However, when Chen Sanmei delivered laundry, she developed a good impression of other traffic police officers, and Zhu inevitably showed jealousy in his words and expressions. He took the opportunity to steal a photo of Chen's daughter, intending to use it against her. Unexpectedly, Chen's daughter found out and insisted on returning it. Zhu left in anger. At around 4:00 AM the morning before last, Chen and his wife were fast asleep when they suddenly heard their daughter scream in her room. They rushed inside and saw that their daughter was lying stiff in a pool of blood, already dead. Upon examination, there were several knife marks on her throat, but the doors and windows were closed as usual. The assailant must have entered and exited through the window. They reported it to the Longzeng Police Sub-bureau in charge. Based on the previous situation, they went to the Traffic Police Brigade to summon the suspect, Zhu Jinfa, but Zhu had not been seen for two days and had probably fled out of guilt.

### Hangzhou Paradise in the Midst of Rising Prices

— Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 14th, Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

As the heat wave of the "autumn tiger" comes, the rising prices of Hangzhou follow. Flour, vegetables, pork, and eggs have all risen sharply, increasing by as much as 80% in two days. The small people are at a loss as to what to do. Some poor civil servants rush to buy silver dollars when they receive their salaries and then exchange the silver dollars for banknotes when they need money, because any savings cannot withstand the jump in prices. Banknotes are losing value every day. Therefore, Qingtai Road, where the most silver shops are located in Hangzhou, especially the Tangzi Lane and Zhubao Lane near the large silver shops near Qingtai Road Lujiao, is filled with the incessant "kakadangdang" sound of hammering silver dollars, forming a sound that threatens people's nerves. If you approach them, they will ask if you want "large head" or "small head"? Do you want gold? In every newspaper in Hangzhou, in addition to the market price of gold, there is also the price of "black gold," which is about 10% cheaper than the price of gold in shops.

Compared to the financial market in Shanghai, Hangzhou is naturally not comparable. Shanghai is already talking about US dollars, while Hangzhou is still talking about silver dollars and gold. However, every gold and dollar tycoon in Shanghai is thinking about how to concentrate wealth in himself, while most people in Hangzhou only buy and sell silver dollars because they have no other choice. Of course, there are many rich people in Hangzhou, and they also do gold and dollar business, hoarding goods, and even taking advantage of low prices to buy the people's necessary food in the name of the public, and then saying that low grain prices hurt farmers and demand high prices, such as in this era of chaotic prices, when early rice has already been harvested and threshed, we have seen large quantities of grain being transported out in counties that produce grain, but the price of rice has not fallen but is still frighteningly high. Although legal tender is depreciating and other prices are soaring, rice is still the mainstay of all goods, and with its value multiplied a hundredfold, other goods are even more crazy. The most pitiful are the farmers in the countryside. They work hard all year round, and most of their harvest is distributed by donations, apportionments, and taxes, and all they get is legal tender that is depreciating every day.

This summer, there has been very little rain in Hangzhou. After autumn, there is still a general drought. We cannot help but think of this group of good farmers who work tirelessly. They water the fields day and night, and even if their hands and feet are blistered and their skin is tanned "soy sauce", they still work non-stop. How much work have we people who are enjoying life today, especially the people in the officialdom, done for them? How many sufferings have we solved? Their watering tools are still the old set from more than a hundred years ago, and their methods of cultivating the fields are also old and outdated. The people who enjoy life have forgotten them. Has the government also forgotten them?

The autumn harvest is coming soon. How often do we think about how the autumn harvest will be this year? How to comfort the hard work of the farmers? People in the city have recently been somersaulting in "money" and cannot think of these things at all.

Under the high pressure of prices, the farmers see that their hard-earned harvest cannot sustain their food and clothing, and they may flee the countryside in large numbers to engage in other occupations. If this is the case, if this continues, the consequences will be unimaginable.

In Hangzhou, the private prostitution that was once banned has recently become more active on Yingshi Street. In the past, they were middle-aged women who seemed to be skilled in this business. Now, some young girls, as if they had just come from the countryside, are shyly soliciting customers.

The number of unemployed people is also gradually increasing, and people are coming and going, all looking for jobs. Some fail to find jobs and have suicidal thoughts. Some fail to find jobs and eat a free meal in a restaurant. The number of beggars is also gradually increasing, and almost every household has a beggar at its door. The newspapers in Hangzhou often carry news of suicides and murders, and most of these suicide news are related to unemployment and promiscuity.

Of course, most of the responsibility for the above situations lies in the skyrocketing prices and depreciation of legal tender. The government's countermeasures for dealing with this matter seem to be only focusing on tightening the money supply. After the money supply is tightened, the banks naturally feel the pain of not being able to balance their accounts. Therefore, each bank issues a type of banker's draft. It is said that this banker's draft can also be used to buy goods and can also be deposited in the bank. Then the government's so-called tightening of the money supply is still useless. Recently, banker's drafts are flying everywhere in the city of Hangzhou, and prices are still rising continuously.

Although Hangzhou has the beauty of West Lake, thousands of citizens are shocked by the prices. They are no longer in the mood to admire this beautiful lake and mountains, so the summer night business of the rowboats is not good, and every night garden has lost money. Some scenic areas where people can cool off do not have many visitors.

At the turn of summer and autumn, Hangzhou has only become a transit point for people escaping the heat. People going to Mount Mogan must pass through Hangzhou, and people going to Guling must also pass through Hangzhou because there have been no planes recently, and they have to take the Zhejiang-Jiangxi train to Nanchang, Jiujiang, and reach the foot of Mount Lu.

The only hope of the people of Hangzhou is that the hot summer will pass quickly, and the autumn tiger, which is almost as hot as summer, will also pass quickly, followed by clear autumn weather. The Nine Streams and Eighteen Gullies, the red leaves on Jade Emperor Mountain will bloom, the Osmanthus flowers in Manjuelong will spread their fragrance, and the trees around the lake will deepen their greenness. At that time, tourists from Beijing and Shanghai will increase again, and the shops in Hangzhou will be able to earn a sum of money. The shops in Hangzhou think so, and the monks and Taoists in Hangzhou also think so. Vendors, rickshaw pullers, tricycle pullers, and car dealerships all think so, but do the vast majority of people in Hangzhou who rely on salaries have the leisure to think so?

### National Defense Front Line: Mazong Mountain

— By our reporter Song Lin

[Our Lanzhou dispatch, 5th] Mazong Mountain is a remnant of the Tianshan Mountains, with an altitude of approximately 2,000 to 3,000 feet. It is located north of Anxi County and is the northernmost part of Gansu, bordering Outer Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Ningxia, forming a triangular area of ​​more than 91,000 square kilometers. In medieval times, this was a fiercely contested area. The Xirong, Yuezhi, Xiongnu, Han, Western Xia, Mongol, and other ethnic groups shed blood here. During the Qing Dynasty, under the Qianlong Emperor, it was incorporated into Anxi Prefecture. Since the Republic of China, it has been under Anxi County. It is currently governed by the newly established Subei Administration Bureau.

Due to its strategic location, and following Outer Mongolia's "independence," it has become the foremost frontline for national defense in the Northwest. Therefore, upon arriving in Jiuquan, we discussed it with Mr. Wang Weiyong, the administrative commissioner of the Seventh District. According to Commissioner Wang, Mazong Mountain belongs to the Subei Administration Bureau, and the residents are all Mongolians, totaling less than 1,000 people. However, they do not reside on their land, instead residing in the Xihu and Bulongji areas between Anxi and Dunhuang. They are roughly divided into two tribes: one part of Qinghai, led by Gong Baoju, and one part of Xinjiang, led by National Assembly representative Sebulah. The Administration Bureau is also temporarily located in Sandaogou Town, Anxi, 400 li away from its people. The current director is Cao Kuiwen. Therefore, we are greatly interested in the Subei Administration Bureau, which is completely disconnected from its land, people, and government. Along the way, we inquired about the situation of Mazong Mountain from everyone we met. From conversations with Zhang, the battalion commander stationed there, Liao Fengyun, the brigade commander of the 191st Brigade, Huang Zuxun, the division commander of the 23rd Division, Zheng Zhuanghuai, the chief of staff, and the county magistrates of various counties, we have learned the general outline. Battalion Commander Zhang even advised us to go into the mountains for a look when we were in Anxi, but due to the inconvenience of transportation and the shortness of time, we declined his kind offer. Mazong Mountain is a desolate area. Only those who go to Irtysh to do business have yurts in the mountains. In the 27th year of Guangxu (1901), a small number of Mongolian people from Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang began to graze here. In the 7th year of the Republic of China (1918), the prohibition of opium was quite strict in Gansu Province, and more than 300 local ruffians sneaked into the Ike-gaol area of ​​Mazong Mountain to plant opium. Since this place was outside the law, the number of residents increased day by day.

Mongol-Kazakh Grievances Deepen

In the 8th year of the Republic of China (1919), a young Outer Mongolian named White Camel Lama entered Mazong Mountain. He built a stone city and fortifications on the southern Xiaoshan Hill in Gongpoquan, wanting to compete with Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the leader of Outer Mongolia. By the 11th year (1922), the Han Chinese gradually moved elsewhere. At this time, Gongpoquan already had 30,000 to 40,000 head of livestock and 300 Mongolian yurts, all of whom were undergoing military training. Although our government did not inquire about it in order to calm things down, Outer Mongolia regarded it as a hidden danger. Therefore, in August of the 12th year (1923), Kulun sent assassins to assassinate the White Camel Lama. Three months later, more than 500 Mongolian cavalry were sent to raze Gongpoquan to the ground, and all the Mongolian people were killed or captured.

After the 13th year (1924), the Mongolian people gradually fled back. In the 17th year (1928), Kazakhs who fled from Zhenxi in Xinjiang entered the mountains and plundered and killed everywhere. The government immediately commissioned Baobula, the leader of the Mongolian people, to form a self-defense force to suppress them, and the Kazakh people fled elsewhere. At this time, there were more than 600 Mongolian yurts fleeing from Ningxia, Xinjiang, and Outer Mongolia. The Mongolian people who fled from Outer Mongolia, because of their hatred for the new regime in Outer Mongolia, went to Outer Mongolia from time to time to demonstrate. Finally, in the autumn of the 21st year (1932), the Outer Mongolian government sent 300 soldiers to suddenly attack Mazong Mountain, massacring more than 400 Mongolian people. The Kazakh people took the opportunity to come and attack again. The remaining Mongolian people fled to the Yuerhong area of the Qilian Mountains, and the remaining dozen or so Mongolian yurts later took refuge in Anxi and Dunhuang.

After the Xin-Sui Company's cars passed through this area in the 23rd year (1934), Anxi commissioned the head of the regiment, Zhang Bulin, to appease the refugees, set up tax checkpoints in the mountains to collect camel taxes and grass-head taxes, and the Mongolian people gradually returned. By the winter of the 24th year (1935), there were more than 100 yurts again. Following this, Kazakhs from Altay, Zhenxi, and other places in Xinjiang fled to Mazong Mountain one after another because they could not bear the oppression of the Xinjiang government. By the end of the 28th year (1939), there were more than 2,500 yurts and more than 12,000 people. These Kazakh people moved into Mazong Mountain originally to escape the arrest of the Xinjiang government, but later they began to rob and plunder, and the Mongolian people had to flee elsewhere again. At this time, the War of Resistance was in full swing. The government repeatedly tried to appease and suppress the Kazakh people. Since the 32nd year (1943), the Kazakh people have been restricted from moving into the Qilian Mountains, and the Mongolian people in this area have been merged into Mazong Mountain, with the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway as the boundary, and they are not allowed to infringe on each other. However, such a vast and desolate area cannot be prevented at all times, and the accumulated hatred between the Mongolian and Kazakh ethnic groups is getting deeper and deeper, and they often retaliate against each other. Now, except for the garrison, there are almost no inhabitants in Mazong Mountain.

Three Strongholds, National Army Garrisoned

We had no opportunity to visit the true face of Mazong Mountain, but we only heard people say that the northern part is full of Gobi and quicksand, while the southern part is interspersed with water and grass and sand mines. Distributed animal husbandry and cultivation are not absolutely impossible. Medicinal herbs and minerals are also very rich. At present, the three strongholds of Gongpoquan, Mingshui, and Malianjing in Mazong Mountain are all garrisoned by our army, so there is no need to worry about disturbances. However, due to the inconvenience of transportation, the soldiers stationed in the mountains cannot eat green vegetables more than twice a month, and they lack vitamins, so color blindness, leg swelling, and other diseases occur from time to time. Those who entrust hope that the supply aspect should be improved immediately, and at the same time, the contact aspect should be further strengthened.

In recent times, someone wrote a poem about Mazong Mountain. Reading it, one can imagine its terrain. The poem says: "Looking at the mountain on the flat sand is like seeing it in front of you, riding a camel and stepping on snow for another day. The peaks of Mazong Mountain are as long as snakes, and thousands of hills and ridges are connected to each other. I say this mountain has the danger of a tiger's back, but people call it Mazong. The yellow sand and black stones make one wonder if there is no road, but suddenly a hole opens up... Two mountains stand like walls on both sides of the main road, and mountains outside the mountains are like screens. The peaks are so steep on all sides that they seem like a line to the sky. How vast and obscure are the ancient dwellings... At night, we set up tents at the southern mouth of the mountain, and in the morning, the tea smoke is thick as we watch the sun rise..."

[Our Wujin dispatch, 14th] Wang Hong, a resident of Nan Zhai Town, is over fifty years old and a widow. She only has one son, Bai Geng, who is 22 years old. She once used dozens of packs of cigarettes to exchange for four exemption application forms from the town office, carefully filled them out and sent them, but received no response. Deputy Mayor Bian Yifei claimed that 15 shi of white rice must be paid to postpone conscription; 30 shi can be exempted forever. Wang could not afford it because of her poor family, so she sent her son to Beijing to join the training corps as a first-class soldier. Bian, failing in his extortion, accused Wang of being a drafted young man and repeatedly reported to the county to ask the training corps to send him back. At the same time, on April 6, Wang's mother was detained in the town office, and she was ordered to pay for a replacement or pay a fee. Then, on the grounds of resisting conscription, she was transferred to the district and sent to the county. After more than a month, she was released on bail. Recently, Wang Baigeng returned home to visit his relatives. After learning about this, the town office immediately sent soldiers to arrest Wang and send him to the district and then to the county. Wang's mother, accompanied by relatives, appealed to the county government. After investigation, it was confirmed that Wang was indeed an only son, and the claim that he had been drafted was unfounded. Bian Yifei is now avoiding being seen.

### Solemn Appeal: Zhejiang Administrative Society Urges Emphasis on Political Work

[Our Hangzhou dispatch, 14th] Colleagues from the Zhejiang Administrative Society in Hangzhou are deeply concerned that the people of the country are increasingly worried about national affairs, focusing on military affairs or concerned about the economy, but inevitably neglect political work. Therefore, after careful review by the fifth session of the members of the association, a text was drafted and a solemn appeal was issued, hoping that people of insight could pay more attention to political work and strive for progress and innovation from ordinary reality. The following are excerpts of the main points of the full text for reference by all sectors.

First, we are now suppressing the rebellion, so of course we must not create chaos again. We have now implemented the constitution, so of course we must not violate the constitution at will. It must be understood that violating the constitution is creating a source of chaos, and to put out the newly born source of chaos, we must abide by the constitution. All those who love chaos oppose the law, especially the constitution, because rule of law and turmoil have never coexisted. Therefore, we do not approve of any remarks or actions that overthrow, amend, change, shake, or violate the constitution. Second, the country's turmoil has reached its extreme. To save this situation, we can only implement the local system stipulated in the constitution as soon as possible. In other words, the past excessive centralization of the central government has made local governments unable to do anything. Can a county be an autonomous unit? The miracles of Wang Fenggang and Bi Tingfang in North China are that they can adapt to local conditions and do not necessarily have to be constrained by too trivial central laws and regulations. The three-level equalization system of the central, provincial, and county governments in the constitution was stipulated after repeated research by the Father of the Nation. It should be implemented quickly. In particular, the draft Provincial and County Autonomy General Rules should be formulated as soon as possible, and attention should be paid to being true to its name. It should only be general rules and not be too trivial, lest the provincial and county autonomy laws in the future have no content. To build a country today, we must first build a local government. There is absolutely no way that a person with weak limbs can support a congested head.

Third, the current people are extremely poor. The numbers for everyone's living expenses have increased, but the standard of living has decreased. In this low, unspeakably low life, there are still so many burdens. There are too many places where the current system of land tax, taxes, and conscription can be reformed. In all fairness, the people are not unwilling to bear the burden of the country, but innocent losses that are useless to the country and harmful to the people should be avoided.

Fourth, when it comes to the administration itself, it is nothing more than cutting down redundant agencies, increasing the salaries of public officials, implementing the civil service system, and increasing administrative efficiency. Everyone has said a lot about these words, and there is really no need to say more. Our meaning is that in terms of employment, Article 85 of the constitution stipulates that "those who have not passed the examination shall not be employed." As for institutions, in the past ten years or so, I don’t know how many have been established and abolished. We only hope that the country can set up more constructive institutions to accommodate people who really want to do things, so that they can do things. Reducing agencies, concentrating power, and naturally efficiency can be improved. Reducing agencies, saving expenses, and naturally salaries can be increased. Reducing agencies, not using many people, and naturally incompetent people cannot be promoted by luck. Reducing agencies, clarifying responsibilities, and naturally the people will no longer suffer innocent losses. At the same time, when cutting and merging agencies, it is necessary to immediately run more construction projects to absorb talent and increase social wealth.

### Real Situation of the Besieged Jinan: The Military Crisis Has Passed - Economic Problems Deserve Attention

[Our Jinan dispatch] Since Chazhou, Jichang, Weixian, Taian, and Zouxian were abandoned, Jinan has become the most isolated city on the mainland battlefield. This besieged city currently has only one line in the air that can be connected to the outside world.

At this time, the bandits launched a nerve offensive against Jinan. On the one hand, they mobilized troops and generals, deliberately setting up suspicious formations, and transferred the main force of seven columns remaining in Shandong (that is, Chen Yi's 6th, 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, New 8th, and Bohai Columns). All of them were transferred to the periphery of Jinan in Taian, Feicheng, Fanjiazhen, Shibeijie, Longshan, Zhangqiu and other areas. On the other hand, they also extensively recruited civilians and built siege ladders in preparation for attacking the city. At the same time, the New China News Agency repeatedly claimed to capture Jinan, which aroused the hearts of the people in Jinan. On the 9th of this month (August), this feeling of unease can be said to have reached its climax. From the 10th onwards, on the one hand, due to the airborne arrival of strong national army troops in Jinan, on the other hand, the remaining seven bandit columns gathered outside Jinan, due to difficult supply, had to be forced to occupy Wenshang, Ningyang, Qufu, Loud and other areas on both sides of the Wen River for replenishment and training from the 4th of this month. At this point, a stone in the hearts of the 700,000 citizens of Jinan finally landed. The airline seats that had been registered until October of this year are no longer as crowded as in the past due to the easing of the situation. The Lu natives in Beijing, members of the National Assembly and supervisors, and fellow villagers once caused an unpleasant memory of disturbances at the Presidential Palace in order to demand that the government increase troops to ensure Jinan, which can be regarded as having been compensated.

Judging from the current situation, the military crisis in Jinan has passed. The old airport in Zhangzhuang, near the Yellow River's south bank in the northwest suburb of Jinan, has seen its defense strengthened due to the arrival of reinforcements. Although the Jinan City Ring Railway is only planned and there is no hope of construction due to limited funding, the new airport that was added east of Qilu University in the southeast suburb of Jinan on the 18th of last month has been half completed under the unanimous efforts of all sectors of the city and will be fully completed by the end of this month. This new airport not only adds a new aerial outlet to the isolated island, but also adds a most powerful guarantee to the 700,000 lives in Jinan City. As for the interior of Jinan City, a large-scale movement to eliminate internal traitors is now underway. The Sui District Administrative Office and the Military Police Inspection Office have promulgated the "Household Registration Control Measures During Extraordinary Periods." Therefore, as long as the reinforcements can arrive in a timely manner when there is tension, Jinan will never become the second Kaifeng; similarly, as long as the "Household Registration Control Measures" can be implemented seriously, all underground organizations and lurking elements of the Communist bandits can be eliminated, and Jinan will naturally never become the second Yanzhou.

From this perspective, the biggest problem facing Jinan in the future is obviously not military but economic. Since July 27, the bandits have officially begun to adopt a blockade policy against Jinan. Except for the very few grains carried by hand, which are still allowed to enter the urban area to exchange for the materials needed by the bandits, all other materials transported by handcarts, large carts, and even horse carts and automobiles are prohibited from being imported. According to reliable estimates, the current grain reserves in Jinan City are only enough for three months. Due to the sharp decline in the purchasing power of citizens, donations and levies are coming one after another, making it overwhelming. Many shops have closed down one after another. Recently, even the largest shops on Weisi Road, the most prosperous two main roads in the city, have closed down one after another. The depression in the market has not only made the living standards of ordinary citizens increasingly low, but has also caused a series of disturbing events such as suicide and robbery. It has long been discovered among the citizens that they cannot afford even corn buns and are filling their hunger with bean cakes. This crisis can only be overcome by the government's efforts.

### General Commodity Prices: Market Rumors Abound, Prices Advance Towards Peaks

Last week, commodity prices, continuing the trend from the previous weekend, advanced steadily at high levels in the early and mid-week. From Friday onwards, there was another surge, with new market prices frequently emerging and often setting new records.

The general wholesale price index for last week was 6,658,248 times the base, an increase of 28.59% compared to the previous week. The market's credit situation was slightly tighter than the previous week, but the National Bank's clearing position showed a deficit of over 2 trillion on Monday and over 1 trillion on Thursday, so the situation cannot really be considered tight. Underground interest rates hovered around 4.5%.

Five million large denomination banknotes have not yet been issued, leading to a severe shortage of cash in the market, and the premium for cash is very common. At the same time, in order to cope with the difficulty of cash withdrawals, banks are issuing promissory notes for circulation in the market, estimated to amount to 50 trillion. This not only violates the principle of credit tightening by the Financial Control Bureau but also easily breeds other malpractices. The authorities should pay attention to this.

Last week, due to the sharp contraction of the Hong Kong exchange rate, general financial commodities were highly sought after. Decorative gold rose from 430 million to 470 million per tael on Monday to 540 million to 580 million at the weekend. Exchange certificates, with government support, also rose to a high price of 7.8 million.

Regarding the government's measures last week, the ones that have a relatively close impact on future commodity prices are as follows:

First, regarding the new economic reform plan, since the meeting in Mochinshan at the end of July, there have been many rumors. With the publication imminent, market prices are also somewhat shifting accordingly. It is reported that the content of the new plan involves stabilizing commodity prices, encouraging exports, attracting overseas Chinese investment, reforming the currency system, merging banks, and cooperating with US aid. However, the announcement has been delayed, with constant changes. Currently, central leaders are gathered in Lushan, and there will probably be important decisions. Frankly speaking, the severity of our country's current economic situation cannot be denied by anyone. The new plan should have a decisive effect on solving the current economic difficulties, and it should bear a great responsibility for the overall situation, whether good or bad, in the future.

Second, the ordinary part of this year's second half general budget was officially announced by the Presidential Office on the 12th, with total revenue and expenditure of 3,236,215,009,860,000 yuan. This budget only covers the ordinary part and does not include the special budget for military affairs. Everyone knows that the consumption of war is the root cause of the government's fiscal imbalance, so looking at this budget alone is not as significant as we imagine. Furthermore, based on past experience, the expenditure in the final month is almost equal to the expenditure for the entire year. With the accelerated rate of price increases and the expansion of the magnitude this year, we are not overly optimistic about the year-end final accounts.

Third, the issue of US aid's Counterpart Funds is receiving much attention from all parties recently, and there is a considerable gap in opinions between China and the United States. The total amount of US aid, excluding the military portion, is US$275 million. The original allocation was US$60 million for construction projects, US$70 million for food, US$70 million for cotton, US$50 million for petroleum, US$13.8 million for fertilizer, US$10 million for industrial parts, and US$1.2 million for administrative expenses. According to Mr. Lapham's announcement to trustees, the construction funds may be increased by another US$10 million, together with US$10 million for industrial parts, totaling US$80 million. In addition, it is said that the US$70 million of American cotton has been decided to be traded for goods, exchanging cotton for yarn, exporting the yarn, and then importing Indian cotton. From this, it can be seen that these two items, totaling US$150 million, already have specific uses and cannot be released into the domestic market to absorb currency, weakening the power of US aid. Today, our country's economic crisis is at a severe stage. We should consider how to overcome this immediate crisis before discussing construction and revitalization. Therefore, it is worth considering whether Mr. Lapham's suggestion will affect the plan to absorb currency.

Fourth, the case of selling state-owned enterprises has been going on for years without any implementation. Regarding the sale of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Mr. Li Yunliang, Secretary-General of the Shipping Association, recently stated, "At this time, some private shipping companies that are unable to maintain their operations are on the verge of bankruptcy and even hope that the government can acquire them and turn them into state-owned enterprises to relieve them of their heavy burdens and prevent continued losses. Therefore, if the government sells the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at this time, there are probably only two types of capital that can acquire it: foreign capital and powerful family capital. The former will spare no expense in seizing our country's shipping rights, and the latter, relying on special privileges, will naturally have no concerns. If the government rashly transfers our country's oldest and largest state-owned shipping organization to foreign capital or powerful family capital, the future of the shipping industry will be unimaginable." As for the sale of the China Textile Company, it is not difficult to imagine that it will face similar difficulties as the sale of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. How should the current financial situation, which is trapped in a dilemma, decide on this major measure?

Although the market price trend last week continued to rise and repeatedly set new prices amidst various rumors, this is probably because rumors are ultimately rumors, and the soundness of the economic situation itself has a decisive impact. Therefore, any economic plan that does not start from the root can only be effective for a while but is difficult to sustain in the long run.

In the yarn and cloth market, the market sentiment was most enthusiastic last week due to the strong bullish psychology. 42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 2.56 billion at the beginning of the week to 3.35 billion on Friday, and 21-count Double Horse rose from 1.95 billion at the beginning of the week to 2.55 billion at the beginning of the week. 120-count Sky Bridge silk also gradually rose from 2.82 billion at the beginning of the week to 3.59 billion on Friday. Under the frequent price increases in the producing areas, rice, except for special japonica approaching the 70 million mark, also broke through the 60 million mark, both setting unprecedented new prices. Oil and flour also followed suit, with a sharp rise. The price of a barrel of peanut oil approached 200 million at the weekend, and No. 1 Battleship flour broke through the 20 million mark. Daily necessities such as soap, matches, and cigarettes also increased significantly. On Friday, Guben soap reached over 86 million, Beauty matches rose to 400 million, and 500 Big Ben cigarettes reached 11.4 million. Other items such as chemicals, metals, and building materials also saw a surge in prices, creating new prices.

The wholesale price index classified by use for last week is as follows:

The wholesale price index classified by the degree of processing for last week is as follows:

### Currency and Finance

(1) Money Market and Underground Interest Rates

The money market in this city last week still showed an overall loose situation. Although the National Bank had a net inflow on three days of the week, the inflow was very small on the one hand, and the excess reserves were abundant on the other, so the impact on the market was very light. It is estimated that the accumulated floating capital in this city recently has reached over 100 trillion, and the authorities seem to have difficulty in handling this floating capital.

When inflation reaches a certain stage, the occurrence of a banknote shortage is inevitable. In other words, the rate of price increases today has already exceeded the rate of currency issuance. Although it is said that some of this is due to "artificial factors," the increase in the quantity of currency is the main cause, and the increased velocity of money circulation caused by people's disregard for currency is the consequence. This explains why the proposed new economic plan, although repeatedly revealing nerve warfare tactics such as strengthening control over banks, the money market has remained as loose as ever. The inevitable result of the easing of the money market is soaring prices, which is the reason for the general price increases last week.

On the one hand, the money market is loose, and on the other hand, there is a severe shortage of cash. Although it is said that the southward flow of large denomination banknotes is related to the banknote shortage in this city, according to news from the banking industry, the sealing dates of the cash funds received by the industry from the Central Bank are even the next day or the same day. This inevitably makes people wonder whether our banknote production capacity is sufficient to meet actual needs. From this, it is not difficult to see how serious inflation has become. Due to the lack of cash, the discount for large denomination banknotes in the market last week even reached one-tenth. At the same time, the Central Bank strictly limited the amount of cash withdrawals by the same industry, resulting in the widespread popularity of bank promissory notes. It is estimated that the average issuance of bank promissory notes per day is at least hundreds of billions and up to trillions, totaling 50 trillion. These promissory notes are not recovered on the same day, which makes the money market in the city even looser.

Underground interest rates were slightly higher on Monday and Tuesday, between 4.5 and 5.4%. On Wednesday, due to the easing of the money market, they fell to 3.9 and 4.2%. Abundant orders were frequently seen near noon. Although they rose again to 4.8% on Thursday due to increased demand, they ultimately fell to 3.9% again on Friday due to abundant supply. As for the interest rate on goods assistance, it was generally between 10 and 15 yuan per day, slightly higher on Thursday, at 18 and 20 yuan.

The results of the National Bank's clearing showed that although there were three days of net inflow from Monday to Friday, after deducting a portion of interbank fixed deposits on Tuesday and the deposits absorbed by the Bank of China on Wednesday, the National Bank actually disbursed 769.6 billion in five days. Although this was a decrease of more than 13 trillion compared to the previous week, because the excess reserves in the market were abundant, the National Bank's disbursement did not have any effect.

From Monday to Friday, foreign banks had a net inflow of 5,646.5 billion, a decrease of 167.04 billion compared to the same period in the previous week. According to investigations, most of this huge net inflow was the result of capital flight.

The funds of commercial banks were very loose. Abundant orders were frequently seen before Wednesday. Interbank lending was not done at all. After deducting the difference in Taiwan Bank's clearing, from Monday to Friday, the actual outflow of banks after No. 60 was only 255.61 billion, an increase of more than 790 billion compared to the same period in the previous week. The increase in demand can be generally seen. The end of price fatigue and the rise in prices can also be seen from this.

(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates

The foreign exchange market fluctuated as follows last week: The Hong Kong Shanghai exchange rate contracted from 6 cents to 5 cents (100,000 legal currency) from Wednesday. The market price of Hong Kong US dollars fluctuated between 5.41 and 5.46 yuan. Gold was 332 Hong Kong dollars per Chinese tael on Monday, falling to 330.75 yuan on Thursday. The price of exchange certificates in this city was 6 million on Monday, and it had repeatedly risen to 7.3 million on Friday.

The listed price of decorative gold in silver shops was 470 million and 430 million on Monday. Afterwards, there were continuous price increases, with the selling price reaching 580 million and the buying price at 540 million at the weekend, an increase of more than 20%.

The domestic exchange rates of commercial banks last week generally increased once on Tuesday and then mostly maintained the high level of Tuesday until Friday. For example, the exchange rate of Guangzhou was 300 yuan on Monday and increased to 400 yuan from Tuesday, with no change until Friday; the exchange rate of Xiamen was 300 yuan on Monday and maintained at the level of 450 yuan from Tuesday to Friday; the exchange rate of Chongqing was 220 yuan on Monday, 250 yuan on Tuesday, 300 yuan on Wednesday and Thursday, and then increased to 350 yuan on Friday. The exchange rate of Wuhan was 180 yuan on Monday, raised to 200 yuan on Tuesday, and remained at 200 yuan until Friday. The exchange rate of Tianjin was at par before Wednesday, a discount of 20 yuan on Thursday, and the discount increased to 50 yuan on Friday, probably due to rumors that the Tianjin-Shanghai exchange rate would be restricted.

(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

At the beginning of the week, the Chinese stock market opened due to the still strong rumors of the new economic reform plan, and there were many concerns about the unknown content. The short side was active, and the market was tired and hovering. Yong Yarn opened at 13,850 yuan and closed at 14,100 yuan. Other stocks showed mutual fluctuations, and the fluctuation range was not large, except for Lianhua, which was limit up.

The next day, due to reports that the announcement of the new economic reform plan would be delayed until the end of the month and the easing of the money market, commodity prices outside the market rose one after another, and the market sentiment turned from fatigue to firmness and suddenly became prosperous. A total of fifteen stocks, including Yong Yarn, Maya, Xinyi, Tongyi, Xinyi, China Fire, China Cement, Huaxin, Shanghai Cement, Yongye, Lianhua, Zhabei, China Xing, Merlin, and Datong, all reached limit up.

On Wednesday, due to the soaring prices of financial commodities and exchange certificates, the situation continued to be firm. Shui Yarn rose to close at 16,320 yuan, and Maya rose to close at 738 yuan. Among other stocks, except for Zhabei and Xinyi, which fell, all others rose.

Starting from Thursday, due to the continuous rise in prices and reaching a peak, the process gradually softened. Seven popular stocks such as Yong Yarn, Maya, Jingfu, China Silk, Huaxin, Lianan, and Guohuo fell, while the rest rose, and three stocks, including China Cement, Yongye, and China Xing, were limit up.

On Friday, due to the soaring prices of commodities outside the market and the silence of news about the new economic reform plan, the market sentiment was quite firm under the hype of the bulls. As a result, Yong Yarn closed at 17,050 yuan, an increase of 750 yuan compared to the previous day. Among other stocks, except for China Cement, which was limit down, and Hengfeng and China Porcelain, which fell, the rest rose, and six stocks, including Xinyi, China Steel, Huaxin, Yongye, Lianhua, and China Xing, were limit up.

At the weekend, due to various rumors and the softness of buyers' confidence, profit-taking and short-selling were active, and the market was tired and declining. Yong Yarn closed at 15,900 yuan, a sharp drop of 1,600 yuan compared to the high price of the previous day. Among other stocks, only Xinyi performed well, and the rest all fell.

### China Trust Bureau Ordered More Than 10,000 Cases of Rayon from Italy

The China Trust Bureau's allocation of rayon was not sold last week because the cargo ship ordered from Italy was delayed. It is now known that this batch of rayon, about 2,000 cases, is on its way to Shanghai and will arrive within this week. As soon as it arrives in Shanghai, the allocation will be restored.

According to the person in charge of the bureau, the total number of rayon ordered by the bureau from Italy is 11,000 cases, which are shipped to China in batches of about 1,600 to 1,700 cases each. The first batch arrived last month, and the goods currently being shipped to Shanghai are the second batch. Therefore, there will be no shortage of rayon needed by the domestic silk industry in the future.

### The World Games Successfully Concluded, Achieving Rich Harvests, Our Team Has Strived to the Best of Their Ability

[Central News Agency, London, 14th] The various competitions of the World Games have been completed. It now seems possible to estimate their true significance. The reporter has been at the scene throughout the World Games and shares the same personal feelings and observations as most athletes, commentators, and observers: this London World Games has achieved great success not only in the field of sports technology, but also in expressing the ideals established when the World Games were founded 52 years ago. On the opening day of the Games, athletes and visitors at Wembley Stadium saw the words of Baron Coubertin, the founder of the modern World Games, short and meaningful, on an eight-foot-high scoreboard: "The important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win, but to take part; the important thing in life is not to conquer, but to struggle." If Coubertin were still alive, he would surely be pleased to see the spirit of the World Games, which is in line with his lofty ideals, expressed unreservedly in various competitions in this Games. Athletes of different colors and religions came to participate in various competitions and compete for championships. It is extremely easy for athletes to be in this tense atmosphere, mixed with the enthusiasm to win glory for the country, which can easily lead to unfortunate events that, on the surface, are destructive to harmony. However, in the two weeks of the World Games, apart from a few unimportant misunderstandings and referee errors, there have been no serious incidents of international disputes or expressions of resentment from a certain country at Wembley Stadium. Participants did strive in the true spirit of sports. Day after day, the audience watching the world's best athletes perform on the spot cheered for the winners, regardless of their nationality. This London World Games will undoubtedly be a peaceful vanguard ambassador between countries in a world tired of war. In terms of sports technology, it is heard that no previous modern World Games has had such amazing performances as this World Games. More than 20 track and field and other sports records have been broken, which is a great achievement. This is all that people can admire and envy. Compared with the countries participating in the competition, although our country did not win any championships, it did strive to the best of its ability. Our basketball team did have a remarkable performance. In the early round-robin elimination rounds, our team defeated Iraq with the highest score in basketball. Lou Wen'ao, our 10,000-meter runner, was the last person to complete the entire course after 13 other people, including the world record holder Hanno, dropped out midway. The audience was deeply moved by his good spirit and expressed enthusiastic cheers to him, no less than those shown to the champion Zatopek. In the 25-mile marathon, Lou Wen'ao once again mustered his courage and ran to second place at the five-mile mark and maintained sixth place at the halfway point, but had to withdraw due to severe pain from blisters on his feet. In the 1,000-meter cycling race, He Hao Hua, our country's only participant, was defeated by inches and collided with his opponent's car, resulting in a shoulder injury and being unable to participate in other cycling events. Such is fate. Our country, which has experienced years of war, only participated in the World Games with a basketball team, a football team, and a very small number of track and field athletes due to practical difficulties, not to win championships, but to promote the true spirit of the World Games. Mr. Wang Zhengting said that the true significance of this year's World Games for our country is that our country was able to participate in it after ten years of hard fighting. The trustee firmly believes that when the domestic situation is stable, given some time, there will definitely be better performances in the next World Games. As for the host country of this World Games, Great Britain, which is suffering from heavy difficulties, it is admirable that it has undertaken this extremely meticulous and intricate task to make this World Games a great success. We cannot hope that Great Britain, which is in economic difficulties, can hold this World Games in the same way as the 1936 Berlin World Games, because Hitler originally used the World Games to promote the strength of the Nazis. But Great Britain has indeed done its best and can be called an excellent host country. This World Games has also been a successful sporting event in terms of attendance, visits, and profits.

### First World Games Basketball Match: Our Team Loses to Chile

— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper: Zhong Zhen

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, London] On July 30th, the first day of the World Games, at 7:30 PM, our Chinese team and the Chilean team competed in the first basketball elimination round at the Harringay Arena in East London. This match was originally scheduled for August 2nd (Monday), but the announcement of the change was made suddenly on the morning of the 30th. Therefore, the audience was sparse that day, occupying only three-tenths of the seats in the arena. Moreover, not many overseas Chinese from our country came to support the team, because most of our compatriots were unaware of the change.

Unexpected Upset

The course of this match was full of suspense. The Chinese team had a great chance of winning, but the result was an unexpected upset, losing to Chile by a margin of five points. One of the reasons for the defeat was that Li Shiqiao was ill and stranded in Singapore, unable to attend. However, the main reasons were the team's inherent weaknesses – small stature, inferior techniques, slow movements, and poor coordination. Conversely, although the Chilean team's skills were mediocre, the players were tall and strong, with tight and quick movements, and a solid defense. The Chinese team's three forwards were all closely guarded, and severely blocked, ultimately losing all opportunities for close shots. The team's points relied entirely on Cai Wenhua's long shots. Our team's defense was ineffective due to the disparity in physical strength. The reporter witnessed the Chilean team's forwards passing the ball back and forth, making quick close-range shots into the basket six or seven times, while the Chinese team's defense struggled to stop them. In terms of skills, our team was far superior to Chile, and the individual performances were particularly impressive. Foreign spectators praised them greatly, making the defeat honorable. The details of the match are recorded as follows:

Tianxi Penalized

After the tip-off, the Chilean team took the initiative, launching a fierce offensive, and completely controlled the ball. Fortunately, their shots were inaccurate, missing many good opportunities. Although the Chinese team had very few chances to get the ball, they made almost every shot, and the score remained very close, from 3 to 9, catching up to 8 to 13. After Wu Chengzhang was substituted out, he returned to the court, making long shots and close shots, achieving remarkable feats, bringing the score to 14 to 12, only one point behind. Unfortunately, five minutes before the end of the first half, Huang Tianxi was penalized for his fourth foul and was sent off the court. Li Zhenzhong was substituted in, but our coordination was poor, and the passes were not smooth. The Chilean team seized the opportunity and turned the game into a 14 to 19 situation. The Chinese team rallied and chased hard. Cai Wenhua made a skillful long shot, bringing the score to 18 to 19, only one point behind. The Chilean team was greatly alarmed and called a "time-out." The buzzer sounded, and the first half ended, with our side only trailing by one point. At this time, the audience speculated widely, with more than half believing that our team would definitely win, because the Chilean team's skills were truly mediocre. As long as our side could get the ball, we would definitely be able to achieve victory.

Fighting Vigorously but Defeated

After the time-out, the Chilean team made a comeback, and still controlled the overall situation. Fortunately, their forwards had no confidence in their shots and missed them all, so the score remained close. Our side was unwilling to show weakness, chasing from 18 to 21, to 21 to 24. Cai Wenhua's brilliant performance, shooting from afar and "hitting three times in a row," earned a thunderous applause from the audience. In the last six minutes, the score became 36 to 40, two baskets apart. The atmosphere inside and outside the arena became even more tense, and the spectators frequently shouted "Jiayou" (add oil, a Chinese expression of encouragement). The Chinese basketball coach, Mr. Song Junfu, was flushed and extremely anxious. If we could defeat Chile this time, our team's future would be bright. Unfortunately, our luck was not good. Bao Songyuan missed a free throw, and was then sent off the court for a foul. Yu Ruizhang was substituted in, further weakening our strength. Although we struggled hard, we were ultimately unable to reverse the situation, losing to the Chilean team by a score of 39 to 44.

The referees for this match were You Cilin and Enpaili, who enforced the rules strictly. Players were frequently penalized for fouls. Players from both teams repeatedly missed free throws. Two players from the Chinese team were sent off the court, greatly affecting the game. The lineup of the Chinese team:

[First Half]

Yu Ruizhang (Cai Zhongqiang), Wu Chengzhang (Yu Jin)

Cai Wenhua (Jia Zhijun)

Bao Songyuan, Huang Tianxi (Li Zhenzhong)

[Second Half]

Cai Wenhua (Yu Ruizhang), Wu Chengzhang

Jia Zhijun

Bao Songyuan, Li Zhenzhong

### Our World Games Delegation Left England Yesterday to Return Home

[Central News Agency, London, 14th] The last group of our representatives attending the World Games to return home, mostly basketball players and swimmers, took a KLM flight to Amsterdam this afternoon to return home, scheduled to arrive in Bangkok on August 18th. They will then transfer to a China Airlines plane to Shanghai, with a possible stopover in Hong Kong for a few days. It is reported that members of our World Games team currently in Manila have sent a telegram inviting our basketball team to travel to Manila to perform a few exhibition games on their way home. However, our World Games team stated that because the basketball team's lineup has been depleted, they have no choice but to decline any invitations. Huang Tianxi, a key defender on our team, has gone to Singapore and did not participate in the match against Italy. At the same time, all of our personnel attending the World Games left London on August 31st.

### Prelude to the Asian Games: New Delhi Games to be Held in February Next Year; Our Country Has Expressed Willingness to Participate; First Asian Games to be in the Philippines

[Central News Agency, London, 14th] Representatives from six Asian countries met here last week to discuss the establishment of an Asian Amateur Athletic Association, and have taken preliminary action on the convening of the Asian Games. A ten-member committee has been established to draft the charter of the Amateur Athletic Association and its affiliated regulations. Our country is represented on the committee by Hao Gengsheng. The association's charter is currently being drafted and will be submitted to various Far Eastern countries for study, and then submitted to the New Delhi Conference for a vote. Yesterday's meeting discussed the location and date of the next Asian Games. Our country proposed that the Asian Sports Association should be convened once every four years, and held in even-numbered years alternating with the World Games. For example, if the World Games are held in 1948 and 1952, then the Asian Sports Association should be held in 1950 and 1954. The meeting decided to accept India's invitation to all Far Eastern countries to hold the Games hosted by India in New Delhi next February. According to people in our sports circles here, our country has expressed its willingness to participate in the New Delhi Games next spring. It is believed that the first Asian Games will be held in the Philippines at the end of May 1950.

### President of National Lhasa School Returns to Nanjing to Report: Calls for Immediate Allocation of Outstanding Funds

[This Newspaper] National Lhasa School in Tibet is the only national primary school in the country. Since 1947, the school has not received any remittances from the government.

Principal Xing Suzhi (commissioner of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission) recently returned to Nanjing from India to report on the situation and appealed to all parties to urge the allocation of 18 months of outstanding funds, which has not yet been approved by the Executive Yuan.

When the reporter interviewed Principal Xing yesterday, he said that in the autumn of 1940, the Ministry of Education, recognizing the importance of education in the Tibetan region, transferred Hebalin Qingzhen Primary School to the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, renamed it "Lhasa Primary School in Tibet," allocated additional funds, and established four grades to experiment with the method of promoting co-education to Tibetans. In the autumn of 1945, Principal Xing was appointed by the Border Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education to take charge of the school. After reorganizing the school affairs, the number of students increased sharply. Many children of Tibetans from all over the country requested admission. The students' origins were no longer limited to Han Chinese children, and genuine Tibetans accounted for half of the entire school. In addition, there were also some children of nobles and foreign students from Ladakh, Kashmir, and Nepal who came to the school from afar. Principal Xing said that although the future development of Lhasa Primary School is very optimistic, it is facing the greatest crisis due to the unresolved political contradictions between the Han and Tibetans and the economic difficulties.

### Lost Books

Bao Zhongqi

It seems that the poor have a fondness for books. Once they have a volume in their hands, they love it and can't bear to let it go. New books and old books are treated as treasures.

Reading Mr. Bai Yong's "Random Notes" in this publication reminded me that I haven't looked back at my few books for a long time. It's not that I neglect them, but rather because I spend more time living at school and because I lack a large bookshelf to arrange and display them neatly. Every time I look for a book for reference, I have to rummage through boxes and cabinets, resulting in a chaotic mess, and I haven't had the opportunity to organize them. I have always considered this a great regret. But now that I can't even afford to buy a new book, unless I sell my old books by the pound, I would be qualified to buy a bookshelf, but that would be like having an empty wallet with no money, a joke. Therefore, the hope of a bookshelf has never been realized.

Taking advantage of the summer vacation, I decided to move the books piled together to the drying platform, regardless of the scorching sun. I wiped the sweat and opened them one by one, allowing these books, which haven't seen the light of day for years, to enjoy a pleasant sunbath.

Like meeting old friends, I greeted Shen Fu from Six Records of a Floating Life, and then exchanged greetings with Tom Sawyer from Mark Twain's pen. Looking at this pile of books and newspapers, many of which had yellowed pages, their age may be older than mine. Most of them were treasured by my father or elder brothers, and the rest were accumulated by me over the past decade. They have increased my knowledge a lot. I was once intoxicated by them, and today it seems like I'm reliving an old dream.

I looked at them triumphantly: ancient volumes, new books, thin books, thick books, Chinese books, English books, small-sized books... I suddenly discovered something strange. I rubbed my eyes heavily with my hand. Where did the larger-sized books go? I was so anxious that I almost jumped up. I turned around and ran back to the small room where the books were piled, but there was no trace of them there.

Then I remembered a maid who was fired by my mother a month ago because she was caught stealing newspapers to give to her lover—a fishmonger. I seemed to see the paper used to wrap the fish in the hands of those housewives was my book. I seemed to see those books had been torn to pieces!

Returning to the drying platform dejectedly, I looked at the books that fortunately escaped the disaster, and couldn't help but feel heartbroken for those that had been lost, including a Thesaurus of Chinese Words that I loved the most.

This is the result of my own carelessness. These books were not destroyed in the fire of war, but were lost in this situation. Isn't it a pity?

The sun fell below the western rooftops, and I took down the books that had been exposed to the sun all day. The next day, I spent the whole day organizing, classifying, and cataloging them. After putting them in boxes, I added a lock.

The wish to buy a bookshelf was again swaying in my mind.

### Rambling Talk on Funeral Couplets

— You Mojun

This publication often has fellow writers compose "Couplets." According to this art in our country's literary history belongs to a side branch, but its difficulty is even greater than prose, poetry, and lyrics. Funeral couplets are also one type of couplet. Now, I will talk about a few examples.

Yuan Shikai was a generation of traitor, who played with the Qing court, betrayed the Republic, and proclaimed himself emperor, thwarted by Cai E, and died in anger. It is not easy to write a eulogy for such a person, so how should one phrase it? Sun Shi Zheng had two couplets for him. The first one says: "Dying of illness and entering eternal rest, let's not discuss the empire or democracy, alas, this world hero's dream has all been turned into illusion. Everywhere there are difficulties and disasters, I hope that from now on, everyone will rest and mind their own business. If you want to determine his merits and demerits for all time, let everyone examine their own conscience!" The second one says: "Throughout his life, he only had two sides, and it was when you, sir, were appointed to the frontier, when people participated in government affairs; even for small talents, he was grateful for the private knowledge, and I secretly felt pity for this old steed. All are of one heart, hoping to avoid the calamity of China being cooked in a cauldron and the tragedy of begging for life. Every time there was a crisis, I deeply enjoyed the eternal joy, and when leaping into the abyss, the headless mass showed their abilities!" The first couplet subtly criticizes him while expressing lament. The second couplet implicitly contains praise. The first couplet speaks of personal friendship, and the second one hopes for national unity, but unfortunately Yuan misled himself. Both of these couplets required a lot of effort.

For the death of General Cai Songpo, it was naturally easier to write a eulogy. For example, the couplet written by Xiong Xiling says: "Bowing down and exhausting himself until his death; a simple burial had his will, still regretting not dying on the battlefield. Although the hero is dead, the country will prosper; he swore an oath to serve great righteousness and never had any selfish desire for the world." Another couplet written by Pu Dianjun says: "His last words serve as a proverb for the world, knowing that his heart was to exhaust himself for the country, even in death he had not finished. This concerns the rise and fall of a hundred years, and the just war was successful, but what will heaven do?" A couplet by Yuan's party member Ni Sichong says: "A flying general? A flying immortal? Riding a horse to the East Sea, riding a whale to the East Sea." "A pioneer? An enlightened one? Mourning him for defending the country, his knowledge surpasses everyone." I don't know who wrote this couplet, but it seems that the bottom couplet came first, followed by the top couplet. "The words 'flying general' are hard to reconcile and are laughable."

When Huang Xing died in Shanghai, I had a couplet for him: "I also do not know why he is so admirable, but looking at the condolences and telegrams, the newspapers publish them in consecutive pages; colleagues, celebrities, weeping and mourning at the door. The sight is shocking, and it is the most tragic event in China! You should regret that the country is still in turmoil. Recalling his travels to Mexico, America, and England, he has traveled tens of thousands of miles; for five years, he maintained the republic and democracy. His suffering and noble character have all been consigned to the eternal waves of the Huangpu River!" This couplet was included in the "Collection of Couplets" published by the Commercial Press, so I still remember it.

When my deceased son, Dunyi, graduated from the Chinese Literature Department of Central University in 1937, he wrote in his handbook: "Staying together for a hundred years is just a dream, and occasionally sharing a meal is nothing but fate!" Unexpectedly, it became a prophecy, and he died in 1940. With deep paternal love, I composed a couplet for him: "Living he could not help, dying he was not heard, staying together for a hundred years is just a dream, and today it is confirmed! Why did he come? Why did he go? Occasionally sharing a meal is nothing but fate, how can I bear to think of it!" At the time, friends who saw it all said that the language was very sad and should be preserved.

Drawing well water for cool tea, slightly red and yellow watching the flowers of Xiamen, waking up in the north window with nothing to do, washing the knife and breaking the live rattan melon again.

Meeting old friends with invitations, heaven sent three cups of Lu wine, leading to the late wind of the fields, casually passing two or three bridges!

Sparrows chirping, cicadas buzzing, it is already evening, a warm bath can be a good sheep, walking from the east field to sit in the west field, chatting about old things from the past.

Being naked can calm Xie's troubles, too much sweat should be avoided when turning the pages of a book, the clouds in the north sky are dark and scattered, the moon rises on the west wall and the cicadas are busy again.

Children laughing, mother's busy delivery, the afternoon chicken reports the egg getting heavy and yellow! Picking tomatoes in the back garden, stir-frying them together should be used for sacrifice to the drinking intestines.

The newly grown loofah is a chopstick long, the zither hangs under the grape trellis, the thatched hut is on Shangshu bank, but the old surname Wang of the poetic elder is not seen!

Is it possible that there is no dust in the chest? Sitting deeply at night and enjoying myself quietly, the stars in the sky can understand words, and the myriad things in the world are laughed into oblivion.

The crape myrtle blooms brightly, reflecting the clear pool, the green bamboo is cool and good for going down to the game, temporarily happy not hearing about the affairs of the world, but pitying the children discussing heroes and heroines!

The mind is tired, the spirit is dizzy, it is difficult to get excited, the husband is lazy and does not neglect three meals! The upper man seeks a fan for calligraphy, but writes orchids with three leaves and double flowers.

The sorghum branches are high, the sorghum is sparse, the pumpkin leaves are large, the purple eggplant is fat, the flying swallows can speak for the first time, just praising Mr. Returning on this day.

### Record of Zheng Dahe

— Qian Dacheng

Zheng Dahe (Wen Zhuo) was as famous for his poetry as Wang Bantang and Mi Guwei, and was exquisitely skilled in epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting. When I was in Suzhou, I successively purchased three of his paintings and calligraphies, as well as four kinds of books with his handwritten annotations, so I truly had a karmic connection with Dahe!

The painting is a small landscape, with unique charm and spirit. The inscription poem says: "The cloud river allows a small boat, heaven and earth accommodate a leisurely man." One calligraphy is a self-written draft of the "Yangchun Melody," and the other is a transcription of Han Yu's poem, with vigorous strokes, truly from the Wei stele style.

The "Collection of Mr. Songhu" with Dahe's handwritten annotations that I obtained has a total of six postscripts, which are cherished and enjoyed, and are fifty or sixty years old. There is also a seal "Together with the maid Nan Rou for enjoyment." Dahe lived in Wumen in his later years and enjoyed wandering in the back streets, calling himself: "The old district of Wu is charming, the new office of Fuqiao is elegant, with floral moons linking emotions, and flowing aspirations in music. The northwest high-rise building occasionally leaves traces of love. If not for a love of beauty, how could one be so unhappy? The sorrow of abandoning the world, how can it be stopped?..." It was merely a self-deprecating remark. He had many concubines, some whose names can be traced, including one named "Keke," who is often seen in his annotated books. Dahe was extremely destitute in his later years, often sitting listlessly in tea houses with an old concubine, still claiming to be romantic, which was merely the ingrained habit of a poet.

Dahe liked to scold people, even his teacher Pan Boyin was not spared. The "Collection of Mr. Songhu" was handwritten and published in regular script by Xu Huanong, a historian, at the request of Boyin. Dahe then commented: "I believe that in the past, there were few books copied in this style. Most Song dynasty engraved books imitated Ouyang Xun's official script style, and the Yuan dynasty official editions of classics and histories, as well as private collections, all admired Zhao Mengfu's calligraphy style. During the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods in Jiangnan, the writing samples for Jing Ke's re-engraved books mostly came from Xu Ganping. Recently, Jin Sheng can also make a name for himself with his handwriting; compared to this, there is a world of difference. If the scholars such as Jianping, Lingpu, and Guyu saw this, they would definitely be stunned..." He also said: "This book's style purely uses sideways and flattering strokes to feebly create a running script effect, which not only goes against the ancients, but also greatly deviates from the conventions of copying books. In recent years, among the Hanlin officials who write this style of script, it is most prevalent in Wu, such as Jiang Jianxia and Fei Junzhi, who can all compete with each other, almost forgetting that it originated from Huanong. This is recorded to warn clerks and scholars who record ancient books!" He criticized everything with his own emotions, and almost none of the contemporary leading figures who studied editions were spared. However, his arguments were indeed valid. Famous figures in the late Qing dynasty generally liked to scold people, which was also a trend of the time.

The "Huainan Wanbi Shu" was handwritten by Wu Boyuan, a secretary (Changshou), and Dahe collated and supplemented it, with red and black annotations scattered throughout, and every word was based on evidence. Dahe was indeed proficient in the art of Qihuang (traditional Chinese medicine), and he once hung up his shingle as a doctor.

The "Biographies of Seal Carvers" and "Reading Records of the Leyuan Garden" also have Dahe's postscripts, and his discussions on calligraphy, painting, and seal carving all have insightful words. Kang Youwei said that Dahe was on the verge of death when he entrusted his son Fubei with his posthumous affairs. Youwei then went to manage his funeral and asked about his collection of books, paintings, and antiques, which had all been sold off. This shows how decadent his late years were! Kang Youwei wrote his epitaph, calling him a poet. People only admiringly call him a "cold red" poet, but his writings were very rich, so how can he be limited to just poetry?

### Brush-Wetting Flowers

— Shilou

The history of flowers records: "Zheng Rong once wrote a poem about money flowers but couldn't finish it. He dreamed of a woman in red throwing money at him, saying: 'To wet your brush!' When he woke up, he found several buds in his bosom, so he jokingly called it brush-wetting flower."

According to research, the brush-wetting flower is actually the money flower, also known as the Ziwu flower, named because it blooms at noon and falls at midnight. The flower blooms yellow in autumn, with petals shaped like coins, and the green leaves and soft branches are delicate and lovely.

The Garden and Plants Records says: "During the Datong period of the Liang Dynasty, it was brought from foreign countries, and now it is found everywhere. It can be planted in magnetic pots, supported by small bamboo frames, and is also an elegant plaything in the study."

Pi Rixiu's poem about money flowers says: "Yin and yang are charcoal and earth is the furnace, casting gold coins without using molds. Vainly showing off colors in front of people, I don't know if they can help the poor?" It has a different meaning.

All rewards for people's calligraphy, paintings, and manuscript fees are generally called "brush-wetting," but today the most unpromising people are the group who live by the pen, and the brush-wetting flower is specifically named "money," which seems too illogical considering its name and meaning.

### Pineapple

— Gongsun Wu

Lychee in English is Litchi, which is probably derived from our country's pronunciation and gotten right. Tea, the British mistakenly pronounce as "te," not knowing that the original word is the common pronunciation in the Minnan and Chaozhou dialects. It is said that the Russians first got tea from our north, and took the sound of the two words "tea leaves" as the name, pronouncing it as "cha-i." Lemon, we call it 檸檬 (ning meng), just like the use of foreign sounds for grapes, goji berries, and pyinbos. However, our country's farmers have only recently started trying to grow this thing, and it is still not as good as foreign goods. Growing fruit is indeed not easy. There are lemons in the South, which are actually the English Lime, and their round shape shows that they are not lemons. The ripe and large ones look like oranges at first glance. Oranges are grafted with lemons, so their fragrance is stronger but the taste is inevitably sour, and the southerners also like their flavor. Why is pineapple called "波羅" (Bolo)? When asked people from Guangdong and Guangxi, no one can say, it must be a foreign word. Jackfruit grows on the trunk of a large tree, like warts, and the large ones hang on the trunk like winter melons or buckets of rice. Its seeds can also be cooked and eaten, and taste like old chestnut meat. The "paramita" in Buddhist scriptures means "reaching the other shore," I don't know why this fruit also got this name. 波羅 (Bolo) in English is Pineapple. The Oxford dictionary says it is named for its shape resembling a pine cone, but this is a herbaceous plant. Someone told me that there are "pineapple trees" in a certain place, which is following the name of the market people and mistakenly taking 波羅 (Bolo) for 波羅蜜 (jackfruit), and then taking 波羅蜜 (jackfruit) for pineapple.

### 

During illness, taking the propaganda and debate texts of world heroes before and after World War II and reading them, I feel bored, and their verbal attacks and lip service are each extremely ingenious in their wording, just like the tacticians of the Five Hegemons and Seven Heroes era of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. It can be seen that "turbulent times produce heroic writing," which is the same principle in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Taking President Roosevelt's "fireside chats" and comparing them with Hitler's "cellar speeches," the verbal battles are fierce. As for Churchill's and Hitler's words of attacking enemy countries in their respective parliaments, and whether Hitler's sending of troops to southern France to face Pétain and Yang, and the declaration of war on the Soviet Union, are reasonable or not, we can leave that aside. Just looking at the articles themselves, "the words on the paper are all lofty," and "the spirit is strong and the words are appropriate," which are solid masterpieces of the "Zuo Zhuan" and "Guoyu" streams. Those who are frightened by modern warfare only know the shocking sight of airplanes, cannons, seaplanes, and atomic bombs, why not also pay attention to the essays that use the pen as a battle array and the words as pearls?

Hitler admired Napoleon, and imitated his military exercises, and even told little jokes, and tried his best to imitate them. On December 11, 1941, Hitler's speech (in his parliament) to follow Japan in declaring war on Britain and the United States, said: "When Roosevelt called me a 'thug,' I would like to point out that this word originated in the United States, and there is no identical word in Europe." Because Roosevelt's fireside chats once referred to Hitler as an "international thug," Hitler did not make a direct defense, but thought it was clever to say that this word belonged to the United States, but in fact he copied the old phrase that there is no "difficult" word in Napoleon's dictionary. Also, a year before the July 7th Incident, when Hirota was the foreign minister of Japan, he announced the so-called three principles towards China. Someone asked about the possibility of war, and Hirota laughed and said: "There is no 'war' word in the dictionary of diplomats." This is also stealing the old words of Napoleon.

When I was young, my English textbook told a story about the West, called "Napoleon's Smart Reply." One day, the emperor was talking with a German general, and the German general said: "Germans fight for honor, while French fight for money." The emperor replied with a smile: "Indeed, we each strive for what we lack." He said that Germans have always lacked honor, so they must strive for honor in war, and the French have always been rich in honor, but lack money, so they use war to make up for their needs. With a turn of the question, the verbal point is chilling, who said that the emperor only works in military affairs? During the Spring and Autumn period, Yanzi of Qi was sent to Chu. The King of Chu intended to humiliate him. When he was drunk, he brought two bound men to him and said, "They are Qi people and sat as thieves." He looked at Yanzi and said, "Are Qi people inherently good at stealing?" Yanzi replied, "I heard that oranges born in Huainan become trifoliate oranges when planted in Huaibei, the leaves are similar but the taste is different because of the different soil and water. Now that people are born in Qi and do not steal, but steal when they enter Chu, could it be that the soil and water of Chu make people good at stealing!" The King of Chu laughed and said, "Sages are not to be joked with, I have instead taken the blame." Yanzi's words and Napoleon's words can be said to be different songs played with equal skill.
