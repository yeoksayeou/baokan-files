### Vice Presidential Election Experiences Twists and Turns, National Assembly Adjourns for Persuasion, Chairman Expresses Respect for the Assembly's Opinion

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] The Presidium of the National Assembly held its 36th meeting on the evening of the 25th to discuss the issue of Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and Sun Ke expressing their intention to withdraw from the vice presidential election. Chairman Hu Shih first had Secretary-General Hong Lanyou report the receipt of the declarations of withdrawal from the election by Cheng, Li, and Sun. Then, they discussed whether to accept the withdrawals. After more than two hours of deliberation, it was generally agreed that the Presidium did not have the authority to accept them. It was resolved to continue persuading Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and Sun Ke to continue in the election. Hu Shih, Yu Bin, Zeng Baosun, Chen Qitian, Sun Yaofu, and five others were designated to carry out the persuasion work, with plans to visit Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian on the morning of the 26th to urge them to withdraw their declarations of withdrawal. It was also decided that the Assembly would adjourn for one day on the 26th to facilitate off-site consultations so that the vice president could be smoothly elected as soon as possible, which would benefit the progress of the Assembly. The Presidium is scheduled to meet again at 4 p.m. on the 26th to study the results of the persuasion of Cheng, Li, and Sun by Hu, Yu, and the other four, and then decide on the agenda of the Assembly on the 27th. Furthermore, when the Presidium held its meeting on the evening of the 25th, Wang Chonghui and Bai Chongxi, after persuading Cheng, Li, and Sun, arrived at the meeting at 10:30 p.m. to report on the process of Zhang Qun, Zhang Lisheng, Chen Bulei, and Zhang Zhiben, under the orders of the Central Executive Committee, persuading Cheng, Li, and Sun to continue in the election. According to Bai and Wang's report, both Sun and Cheng stated that their declarations of withdrawal had been sent to the Presidium to await the decision of the Assembly and that they did not intend to withdraw them. However, before the Assembly made a decision, they could refrain from making further declarations of withdrawal in order to accept the persuasion from all parties. Li Zongren, on the other hand, expressed a firm attitude, insisting on withdrawing from the election, and further persuasion was needed. Li also stated that he did not intend to withdraw his declaration of withdrawal.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang held an extraordinary meeting at 4 p.m. on the 25th. The attending members of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees included Ju Zheng, Li Wenfan, Wu Zhongxin, Wu Jingheng, Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, and fifty others. President Chiang personally presided over the meeting. First, President Chiang explained that the three comrades Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and Sun Ke, candidates for vice president, had successively declared their withdrawal from the election. He asked the members to discuss what decision the party should make on this issue. Subsequently, the members spoke one after another. After an hour and a half of discussion, President Chiang summarized the opinions of the members and gave the following instructions: (1) The National Assembly's election of the vice president in this session is being conducted in accordance with the Election and Recall Law. The party can only respect the public opinion of the Assembly representatives and should not make any other decisions. (2) The legal interpretation of the declarations of withdrawal from the election by Cheng, Li, and Sun should also be made by the Presidium of the Assembly and submitted to the Assembly. (3) In order to dispel misunderstandings among party comrades and promote unity, it is hoped that the candidates will immediately cease campaigning. Wang Chonghui, Zhang Qun, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhiben, Chen Bulei, and Zhang Lisheng were designated to be responsible for this task.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] After Sun Ke, one of the candidates for vice president, withdrew from the vice presidential election on the morning of the 25th, President Chiang summoned Sun at 12 o'clock to inquire about his withdrawal. The conversation lasted for an hour before Sun left.

### Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and Sun Ke All Announce Withdrawal from the Election, Clarifying Rumors and Setting a Democratic Example

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] The vice presidential election has taken a sudden turn. The three candidates with the most votes have successively announced their withdrawal from the election. Cheng Qian, who received the fewest votes in the second vice presidential election of the National Assembly, had an audience with President Chiang on the afternoon of the 24th. That evening at 8 p.m., Cheng hosted his campaign team at the Central Hotel, stating that he would declare to the Presidium of the National Assembly that he was withdrawing his candidacy for vice president. At 2 a.m. on the 25th, Li Zongren also decided to withdraw from the election. His campaign committee issued a notice of withdrawal to the Xinmin Bao that night, stating that someone was distributing leaflets openly attacking Li. In order to express his upright and forthright attitude, Li had declared to the Presidium of the National Assembly that he was withdrawing from the vice presidential election. After learning that Cheng and Li had successively withdrawn from the election on the morning of the 25th, Sun Ke, another candidate, also immediately decided to declare to the Presidium of the National Assembly that he was withdrawing his candidacy. After this news was confirmed at noon on the 25th, the Jing Central Daily issued a special edition at 1:30 p.m., which, in addition to publishing the above news, also contained a "report from this newspaper," stating: "Sun Ke's decision to withdraw from the election is to clarify rumors, dispel misunderstandings, promote unity, and set a good democratic example." The Central Daily reporter also added a note, saying: "The Kuomintang has a majority of seats in the National Assembly, but no decision was made on the candidate for president before the general election. The Central Provisional Plenary Session has allowed Sun, Yu, Li, and Cheng to compete freely. The party has never manipulated votes in any name. Therefore, in the vice presidential election of the National Assembly, no one was able to exceed half of the total number of representatives in the two rounds of voting. The activities of the representatives inside and outside the venue were very enthusiastic, fully demonstrating the spirit of democracy and freedom. Unfortunately, some newspapers have made mutually attacking remarks and news, which has led to a surge of rumors. The most likely to cause misunderstandings is the notice of the Nanjing Traffic Service Agency published in the Xinmin Bao on the 23rd of this month, which stated: 'Some people believe that President Chiang and Mr. Li once had disagreements due to political differences, and it is inevitable that they are psychologically incompatible. President Chiang is therefore unwilling to support Mr. Li.' It also stated that 'a powerful figure in the Kuomintang wants to use the full power of the party to make a certain person succeed in the election,' and pointed out that the powerful figure is Mr. Chen Lifu. There is also a paragraph that says 'President Chiang should use his international reputation to visit Europe from time to time in order to enhance international understanding of us. If Mr. Li can be elected, he will be more than competent to stabilize the situation, and he will also be qualified to deal with foreign affairs.' This kind of naive propaganda could have been dismissed with a laugh, but unexpectedly, it caused rumors among the National Assembly representatives and the general public. Among the spread of various rumors, the mutual attacks of newspapers and leaflets caused misunderstandings among the candidates. Therefore, Sun Ke, following Cheng and Li, also declared his withdrawal from the election, and all rumors and misunderstandings can be clarified."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] The vice presidential election has encountered obstacles when it came to the third meeting. The third vice presidential election assembly, which was scheduled to take place on the morning of the 25th, was temporarily decided to be suspended. At 9 a.m. on the 25th, the representatives still went to the National Assembly Hall for a meeting. However, some representatives did not sign in. At 9:50 a.m., Secretary-General Hong Lanyou reported that 1,875 representatives had signed in, but the number of people present was actually more than this. When Hong reported, some representatives stood up and made a lot of noise. His report was interrupted several times by the noise in the venue. Li Wenfan, the chairman of the assembly today, reported a temporary motion from 332 representatives, including Representative Li Hongyi, which stated: "This assembly has been holding elections for days, and the representatives are mentally exhausted. Today happens to be a Sunday, and it is proposed that the assembly take a day off and conduct a runoff election next Monday. The election is a major national event, and it is hoped that it can be carried out in a calm and solemn manner. It is proposed to take a day off and submit the proposal to the assembly for discussion." After the chairman consulted the assembly and there was no objection, he announced the adjournment of the meeting, and the representatives left the venue amidst the noise.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Cheng Qian, a candidate for vice president, held a tea party at the Peacock Restaurant of the Central Hotel at 8 p.m. on the 24th, inviting the National Assembly representatives who supported his election and the heads of the campaign committee. He expressed on the spot that, in accordance with the principle of humility and self-restraint, he would give up his right to be elected as vice president, and expressed his gratitude to those who supported his election. Cheng then issued a written statement, the original text of which is as follows:

"I originally participated in the vice presidential election, hoping to work for democratic constitutionalism. I am immensely grateful to the representatives for appreciating my humble sincerity and giving me their support. Now that there have been two rounds of voting and no one has been elected, and the candidates are all comrades of our party, I would be happy no matter who is elected. Unity is of utmost importance to the country, which is facing many difficulties, and harmony is the foundation of unity, and self-restraint is the essence of democracy. Therefore, based on this principle, I give up my right to be elected. I respectfully ask the representatives who love me to choose another candidate among the remaining two who is closer to their ideals and cast their sacred vote. I only hope that the vice president will be elected early, the assembly will close successfully, and the new government will be established as soon as possible, so that the people can have a day of rest. My personal advancement or retreat is not worth mentioning, and I will never forget the friendship of my friends."

[Another Telegram] Li Zongren, one of the candidates for vice president, suddenly announced on the 25th, following the lead of another candidate, Cheng Qian, that he was withdrawing from the election. In his letter to the Presidium of the National Assembly, Li stated that his motivation for participating in this election was to serve the party and the country, and that personal gains and losses were not a consideration. In view of the election situation in recent days, "the election has lost its meaning," he hereby formally declared his withdrawal from the election.

[Another Telegram] According to the Sun Ke Vice Presidential Campaign Committee, "In order to eliminate external rumors and strengthen unity, Vice President Sun declared on the morning of the 25th that he would voluntarily withdraw from the vice presidential election and await the decision of the Kuomintang."

### The Democratic Socialist Party Will Express Its Position

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] The National Assembly was obstructed due to the vice presidential election, resulting in events such as adjournment. The Democratic Socialist Party will issue a statement on its attitude towards this matter at noon on the 26th. In addition, the party leader Zhang Junmai has arrived in Beijing. It is reported that the party opposes the increase in the number of legislators passed by the State Council on the 22nd. It has sent a letter to President Chiang, explaining the reasons for its disagreement, but has not yet received a reply.

### Taiwanese People's Organizations Issue Statement Demanding the Truth About "Autonomy," Promoting National Prosperity and Not Separating from the Motherland

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 25th] After the Taiwanese National Assembly representatives submitted a proposal to the National Assembly requesting the implementation of local autonomy, there have been various rumors circulating outside. Newspapers have even used large headlines saying "Taiwan Demands Self-Government." Now, in order to avoid misunderstandings at home and abroad, various people's and cultural organizations in Taiwan Province have issued the following statement: Autonomy is by no means separation. We are demanding autonomy based on the Constitution. This is not the autonomy that Taiwan sought from the United States and the United Kingdom before independence, nor is it the autonomy that Taiwan sought from the Japanese during the Japanese rule, because the people of Taiwan are of the Chinese nation, and the land of Taiwan is the territory of the Republic of China. We are the masters of the country, not the people of a colony, this is the first point; Our so-called "autonomy" is local autonomy, it is true democratic politics, and it is absolutely not allowed for a few ambitious people to take this opportunity to become officials and make a fortune, this is the second point; Taiwan's role as a demonstration zone for the implementation of autonomy is to promote the realization of local autonomy throughout the country, so its purpose is to actively participate in national politics and contribute all of Taiwan's strength to achieve national prosperity, strength, and happiness, rather than to separate from the motherland, this is the third point. The above is the common will of all the people and cultural organizations in Taiwan, and it is also the true motivation for proposing the implementation of local autonomy in Taiwan Province. It must be used to inform people at home and abroad.

### Certificates to Be Issued Today to Elected National Assembly Representatives

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 25th] The issue of issuing certificates to the signed representatives was decided on the 25th after consultations between Chen Lifu and Zhang Lisheng. The certificates will be issued by the Election Headquarters at 11 a.m. on the 26th. If the certificates are not printed in time, a temporary proof of document will be issued first. After the signed representatives receive the election certificate, it was originally stipulated that they should write a letter of resignation. Now it has been decided that it is no longer necessary to use the word "resignation." Instead, the signed representatives only need to write a statement that they will not attend this National Assembly. The statement should state that they have been legally elected with the most votes and that they are following the repeated exhortations of the President and the explanations of Mr. Yu Bin and Mr. Wang Yunwu of the National Assembly Presidium, that the election certificate is issued in accordance with the election results, and that due to factual difficulties, they are willing not to attend the first National Assembly. The party will allow them to replace the certificate with a new certificate when the supplementary elections for occupational and women's groups are held in the future. Otherwise, they will attend the next National Assembly with the original certificate, and the party will find other ways to deal with the friendly parties in the same region.

### National Assembly Proceedings: Adjournment Suppresses a Potential Crisis

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] With the Vice-Presidential election reaching a fever pitch, everyone was concerned about who among Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian would emerge victorious in this fierce competition. However, unexpected complications arose overnight. Adjournment proved to be the most skillful method, suppressing a potential crisis.

The 25th was a Sunday holiday. Citizens of the capital prepared to listen to the Vice-Presidential election broadcast at noon, go on suburban outings in the afternoon, and watch movies in the evening. However, only those directly involved with the National Assembly lacked such leisure and carefree spirit. Early in the morning, news of the Li Zongren campaign's solemn declaration regarding Li's withdrawal from the election shocked those inside and outside the assembly hall. Subsequently, the news of Cheng Qian's withdrawal was also confirmed. Speculation abounded. The military police at the entrance continued to shout to the attending representatives: "Please carry your representative attendance cards." However, the figures of the candidates and their wives were no longer seen in the crowd. After a while, even the Sun Ke campaign broadcasting vehicle fell silent. A somber atmosphere enveloped the inside and outside of the assembly hall.

Time crawled slowly in people's hearts. By 9:30 AM, the assembly hall was packed. Some representatives were discussing animatedly, while others sat quietly, reviewing documents. There was Li Zongren's solemn declaration, Sun Ke's emphasis on civilian politicians and the importance of the Northeast, thank-you notes from both to representatives for their intended support, and propaganda pieces presenting the opposite perspective on the reasons for Cheng Qian's withdrawal. News reporters were even more nervous, running around, surrounding people related to all sides, probing and questioning relentlessly. However, besides knowing that the presidium was meeting backstage to discuss the letters from Li and Cheng regarding their withdrawal from the election, everyone was waiting. Some were waiting to cast their ballots, while others were waiting to see what would happen. Until, at 9:45 AM, applause resounded from the Sichuan representative section in the back of the assembly hall. It turned out that Yu Youren was passing through there on his way out. After a while, he walked back in amid applause, walking to his seat in the front row. The applause grew louder and louder, and finally, the entire hall cheered. Yu Youren nodded and thanked everyone, while repeatedly waving his hands to ask everyone to be quiet. Under the mercury lights, his face was flushed with excitement, and his silver beard was particularly striking. His eyes contained a moist, grateful glow. He was speechless. The applause and cheers lasted for a full minute. The topic of conversation in the assembly hall shifted to Yu Youren. Everyone was saying, "The Elder's demeanor is unmatched. Even the victor would find it difficult to achieve such glory." Ten minutes later, a Xinjiang representative said, "Why is it only today that everyone recognizes Mr. Yu's demeanor!"

At 9:50 AM, the chairman of the assembly, Li Wenfan, had just taken his seat when shouts began to erupt from upstairs and downstairs. Although amidst the chaos, no one could hear clearly what they were shouting. Judging from the location, it was clearly representatives from the North, Central China, and the Southwest who were opposing Li Zongren and Cheng Qian's withdrawal from the election. With great difficulty, Hong Liyou managed to get the tally and reported the number of attendees: he said, "...1,875 representatives have signed in, but the number of people in the assembly hall is definitely more than that. There must be many representatives who attended but did not sign in." Following that, Chairman Li asked Secretary-General Hong to read out the temporary motion from Li Hongyi of Henan and 352 others, saying that the election had been going on for two days, and everyone was exhausted due to the tension. The 25th was also Sunday, so they should take a break. This motion was immediately passed without objection. The chairman said repeatedly, "Today's session is adjourned. Adjourned. Adjourned."

This temporary motion temporarily solved many difficult problems, answered many doubts, diluted some dangerous situations, and even saved the lives of many patients with heart disease. The representatives dispersed. Some went to Yanzi Rock to see the Yangtze River flowing eastward, admiring the imperial stele where Emperor Qianlong expressed his love for the people. Some went to the Martyrs' Shrine and Linggu Temple to commemorate the martyrs, silently appreciating the lingering spring. Some participated in the Red Cross Garden Party at Xuanwu Lake, boating and eating cherries. Some watched movies, strolled along the streets, and passed the holiday. However, the vast majority continued to gather nervously to discuss solutions and await news.

The whole story is this: Cheng Qian's vote count lagged far behind in the re-election on the 24th. Afterwards, in order to expedite the results of the election and out of friendship with the competitors, he declared his withdrawal from the election to the presidium that evening. After the adjournment on the 25th, he and his campaign staff told visiting reporters: "The withdrawal from the election was entirely voluntary. Since one's virtue and ability are lacking, it is natural to know when to retreat." Li Zongren was the top vote-getter in both elections and had a clear lead, but at 3:00 AM on the 25th, the Xinmin Daily suddenly received his campaign's solemn declaration ad. It stated that because someone had recently been distributing leaflets, publicly attacking him, saying that "if he is elected Vice-President, he will force the palace, or force the leader to go abroad in three months." To protest this "slanderous and insulting" attack, he decided to withdraw from the election, "to show his upright attitude." However, in his formal statement sent to the presidium of the assembly on the morning of the 25th, he said: "Recently, I suddenly discovered that someone is using the name of the party to oppress and control, so that the representatives are unable to exercise their right to vote freely," believing that "the election has lost its meaning." After the recess on the 25th, reporters could not find any trace of Li. Mrs. Li did not say a word. This was the root of the uneasy mood before the meeting on the 25th. However, the presidium's decision at the emergency meeting was that there was no legal basis for declaring withdrawal during the election process, and the presidium had no right to accept it. At 10:30 AM, Mrs. Sun Ke appeared in the empty assembly hall. An hour later, Sun Ke's voluntary withdrawal statement was also sent to the presidium office. His campaign's statement said that this was to clear up outside rumors and that everything would be decided by the Kuomintang. What was presented to people at noon on the 25th was a cold scene, so cold that it almost stopped people from breathing.

In the afternoon, the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee held an emergency meeting. Until the evening, it decided to maintain the principle of free elections. The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and the presidium of the assembly both put forward people of high moral standing and reputation to resolve the deadlock. Furthermore, the presidium also decided to adjourn the session for another day on the 26th, so that this important effort would have sufficient time to proceed. The adjournment on the 25th suppressed the potential crisis, and the adjournment on the 26th might reverse a losing game. (April 25, Nanjing)

### Editorial: The Status of Professors Amidst Student Protests

In the past month, student protests have broken out in many universities in our country. The causes vary, but the common action they exhibit is boycotting classes. The situation is complex, and rumors are difficult to verify. It is not easy for us to provide a comprehensive and accurate discussion here. However, considering that higher education is related to the nation's future, we cannot help but say a few words on this matter.

During this eventful and turbulent period, especially amidst the emotional intensity of current student protests, it is difficult for us to expect young people to calmly examine the situation, express the will of the majority, or heed the advice of society. However, we are most concerned about the loss of valuable studies for these university students. We believe that those who care most about the students' studies are, of course, their parents, followed by the professors who personally teach them. And parents still rely on professors to calm the student protests and guide their children.

In many school strike waves in Europe and America in recent years, we cannot deny that the majority of professors often adopt a laissez-faire, wait-and-see attitude. In theory, they do not agree with the means of boycotting classes, but they have not had the collective power to stop them. Some even seem to regard themselves as outsiders, thinking that this is an issue between the students and the government. The attitude of waiting and seeing and letting things go reduces the power of parental decisions, discourages the majority of hard-working students from expressing their opinions, and allows the minority who control and manipulate to be even more reckless! We believe that this fact and awareness are, to some extent, influenced by the hardship of life and the antipathy towards the reality of politics. Therefore, we deeply feel that improving the lives of professors, both spiritually and materially, is not only a prerequisite for exerting the moral power of professors in schools, but also a solemn responsibility that the government and society should jointly shoulder. It must be known that university professors are responsible for cultivating talented people who will be the backbone of the next generation of society, and their lives and situations today are even more difficult than during the war. Therefore, in the future, in addition to the already established principle of adjusting salaries according to the index, educational administrative authorities must earnestly take responsibility for the prompt distribution of salaries, the increase of research grants, and the multi-faceted planning of welfare undertakings, and make great efforts to improve the treatment of educational personnel.

The lives of professors must be guaranteed, and the status of professors must be respected. Conditions such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation are life, while studying knowledge, imparting knowledge, or what the ancients called "transmitting the Way and resolving doubts," represent the existence or life of teachers. In the current school system, the main way to carry out this task of imparting knowledge and cultivation is through attending classes. Therefore, the continuation of studies is where the true life of teachers lies, and the act of stopping classes is to despise and even deny the status and existence of professors. Therefore, the arbitrary boycott of classes by students, no matter what reasons they cite, not to mention their responsibility for violating school discipline, is absolutely a disregard, ridicule, and insult to professors. Imagine how embarrassing it would be for a learned professor who tirelessly teaches people, carrying books to the classroom, to find that not a single student has come? And suppose that some professors who live far away come and go, trying to find out from student union news whether classes will resume or what kind of "strike" is in place, how pitiful is their status? This is felt most deeply by professors who have personally experienced it in the past two or three years, and we need not say more.

The trivial matters of school administration are generally disliked by professors because they are dedicated to teaching. Even in matters of student guidance, such as serving as a tutor, professors are often unwilling to be distracted. This is the norm in colleges and above. However, now, towards the act of boycotting classes, which threatens the very survival of professors, professors can no longer stand idly by for the sake of themselves and others. The basic mission of a university is to cultivate reason and develop specialized talents. Although boycotting classes does not necessarily go hand in hand with violence, it is at least contrary to "appealing to reason." This passive approach only destroys students' own studies and denies the status of professors, while also stifling the function of education. Especially in recent years, it has been used so lightly that it has lost its function of warning, only losing social sympathy, and is actually equivalent to suicide. Young people who are full of vigor may have their reason obscured, but with the wisdom of professors and scholars and their concern for students, how can they not see this very clearly? Learning from the past to avoid future mistakes, intentional professors should not be willing to continue to stand by and let students act rashly, destroying their own sacred mission.

In the past, someone suggested "more cultivation and less intervention" for university education. Today, the government's attitude towards universities and the universities' attitude towards students can be said to be the extreme of non-interference. In response to the current situation, understanding and demanding with empathy, what we hope that university presidents and professors will devote themselves to is "more responsibility and less laissez-faire." The so-called responsibility, for professors, is not limited to teaching, but first lies in establishing the dignity of education and professors, and jointly seeking a stable environment for teaching. University administrators should be responsible for resolving reasonable demands from students or reporting them to the government for forceful advocacy; those that go beyond reason must be responsible for correcting them. In this regard, professors should assist the principals and use the powers of the school affairs meeting and the professors' meeting to protect the stability of the school and improve the atmosphere. The situation in the world is so serious, and the nation's science is so backward. What must be urgently caught up is university education; this is not a time for laissez-faire and inaction.

I remember that during the war, Chongqing University experienced a wave of rejecting the president. Mr. Zhang Jiluan, the former chief editor of the Ta Kung Pao, gave a passionate commentary on the academic atmosphere, criticizing the university students' misunderstanding of freedom and "the indulgence and complacency of some professors," believing that "the opposition of professors to the government and the connivance and indulgence towards students are harming the country." The meaning of reprimanding in the Spring and Autumn Annals and the heart of an experienced person worrying about the country is truly what is meant by "the speaker is not guilty, and the listener should take warning." In view of the various causes of student protests, educational administrative authorities should of course be responsible for handling them, but boycotting classes actually harms youth education and the national foundation, and professors cannot shirk their responsibility for guiding and preventing them in terms of morality and duty.

### 100,000 People in Tumote Banner, Rehe Province, Collectively Attempt to Escape Communist Areas; Unfortunately, They are Attacked by Communists, and Deaths Pile Up Along the Way

[Associated Press, Beiping, 25th] 100,000 men, women, and children in Inner Mongolia, unable to bear the tyranny of the Communists, collectively fled. The Communists relentlessly pursued them, causing numerous deaths. Corpses were piled up along the road. Only 91 people were able to escape the Communist areas and reach Beiping. According to the survivors, five weeks ago, when the Nationalist army withdrew from Fuxin County in Rehe Province, almost all the Mongol and Han residents of the area fled. 20,000 people arrived in Yixian, while the remaining 80,000 were either cut off and driven back by the Communists or scattered along the way. Leading the emigrants were 4,000 Mongol banner soldiers who fought as they marched south for fifty miles, with several thousand killed in action. 70,000 people returned to the Communist Party, where they were either executed or imprisoned for forced labor.

Survivors Recount Communist Tyranny

Wu Ziqing, the judicial team leader of the Fuxin police station in Tumote Banner, said that when they were approaching the outskirts of Yixian and crossing a small bridge, the Communist army fired with machine guns, killing hundreds of people. After a melee, the refugees approached the river, at which time the team suddenly panicked, and only among the Mongols, 400 people drowned. Several thousand Mongols are still trying to reach Yixian, but there is little hope of arriving safely. It is reported that in December 1945, the Communists once occupied Fuxin. In the beginning, the poor people received some small favors, but after the Communist position was consolidated, the people fell into misery. This time, when the Nationalist army withdrew, the residents planned to escape. Under Communist rule, all men over the age of fourteen were forced to join the army, taxes increased daily, requisitions were frequent, and restrictions were extremely strict. Wu Ziqing said that his brother and ten relatives were subjected to torture, and most of them either died or were lost along the way. Refugees said that the most common punishment used by the Communists was to tie the feet of prisoners to horses, drag them through the streets, and call on residents to trample them to death.

### The Arteries of Railways Inside and Outside the Pass

—Special Correspondent of this Newspaper Han Qingtao

[This Newspaper Dispatch from Jinzhou, 20th] The Beining Railway is the arterial railway inside and outside the Pass. Since this arterial railway suffered from vascular rupture, it was almost cut off and suffocated due to obstruction and rupture. Fortunately, thousands of skilled workers, like doctors, diligently and patiently treated and repaired it, restoring its current smoothness and vitality!

Two Organizations This arterial railway has two organizations controlling it. The section inside the Pass, between Peiping and Shanhaiguan, belongs to the "Peiping-Tianjin Railway Administration." The section between Shanhaiguan and Shenyang belongs to the "Jinzhou Railway Administration." The section within the jurisdiction of the Peiping-Tianjin Railway Administration, between Peiping and Tianjin, is in good condition, while the section between Tianjin and Shanhaiguan has suffered considerable damage. Outside Shanhaiguan, the scene of devastation is unbearable to witness.

The train departs from Peiping and can run quickly without any obstacles. After passing Tianjin, it is still good at first. As it approaches "Lutai," the traces of destruction gradually appear before the eyes. Several sections between Tangshan and Shanhaiguan are the most tragic. "Shimen," "Zhuzhuang," and "Liushouying" were burned badly. The station buildings and telegraph poles still bear the brutal scene of the communist bandits' fire attacks.

Sitting in the Jinzhou Railway Administration's passenger car, going out of the Pass and heading towards Wanjialing. In this section, the double tracks are still preserved. Then come the stations of "Qiansuo," "Gaoling," "Qianwei," "Huangdi," "Shahousuo," "Baimiaozi," and others. In the past, everyone often saw these strings of place names in newspapers. These are the places that have been most severely damaged.

Remaining Telegraph Poles The telegraph poles along the road were sawn off or burned. The porcelain insulators on the telegraph poles have become fragments. Piles of discarded telegraph poles are piled near the poles. It is said that the communist bandits shattered them one by one. In order to resume traffic as quickly as possible, the railway administration has either continued the remaining pole tops with pole bases, replaced them with thin wooden poles, or directly inserted the remaining longer pole tops into the ground. High and low, crooked and slanted, the wires are finally connected together.

Where there are no station buildings, sheds have been built. Many station masters and station staff work in the open air. They must work hard while guarding against sudden disasters. Some station staff have been kidnapped and then struggled to run back and continue their work. They receive small salaries and work hard to maintain their positions for the sake of transportation.

The destruction of the railway by overturning or burning is repaired immediately if conditions permit. Sometimes it is repaired during the day, and then destroyed again at night. Repair, destroy, destroy, repair. This went on for a long time. Repair finally prevailed over destruction. The spirit of these unsung heroes is admirable, but the reward they receive is cold and meager.

Repairing Bridges Almost none of the bridges is intact. Many collapsed bridges remain, accompanied by derailed locomotives and carriages. The Jinzhou Railway Administration is currently making the greatest efforts to repair bridges of all sizes. The reporter saw that several large bridges have been restored, while some are being poured with cement or erecting iron frames.

There are often signs along the road warning drivers to "stop and start again," reducing the speed to 5 kilometers per hour. This indicates that there are problems with the bridge ahead. The train is very difficult to travel on. If it can get a breather, it may be possible to restore the bridges between Jinzhou and Shanhaiguan to almost the same condition as before before the flood season. As for the rest, such as signals, communications, and station buildings, that will take a long time.

First Repair Temporary Bridges Currently, the Jinzhou-Shenyang section outside the Pass is in the control area of the communist army. Only more than 50 kilometers of the area between Jiyang and Xinmin are open to traffic. The first hurdle facing the Jinzhou Railway Administration is the Daling River Bridge. The upper and lower lines have been shelled twice by the communist bandits, and none of the bridge piers are intact.

If the military expands, temporary bridges must be repaired first. A large number of wooden piles are needed. It is said that the Jinzhou Railway Administration has made preparations. When the railway administration and the military went to inspect, they were shot at by the opposite bank. The communist army often sends mounted sentries to monitor the movements of the National Army and the railway administration in repairing the bridge. However, it will be repaired sooner or later.

Deploying the Bagua Formation The military authorities have made up their minds to protect this lifeline and at the same time open up the entire traffic on the Beining Road. We saw the strict precautions between Tangshan and Shanhaiguan inside the Pass, and at the same time we saw the more thorough precautions in the section outside the Pass. They are all indicating that the communist bandits cannot be allowed to destroy it again.

Look, trenches and fortifications are being dug everywhere in villages, towns, and stations. Near many stations, there are three layers inside and three layers outside of sloping and sharpened wooden stake fences. Inside, there are also trenches, barbed wire, and "deer fences" like plum blossom piles. In addition, there are various types of bunkers above and below ground, connected above and below ground, mother bunkers and child bunkers, forming a bunker group, communicating with each other and closely linked. It is really a Bagua Formation deployed, waiting for the enemy to come!

The employees of the Beining Road are working hard for this transportation lifeline, and the National Army is also deploying a strong firepower network everywhere. It looks like the opened section cannot be allowed to have major problems again, and the military authorities are rushing to make preparations to "open up" the unopened section!

### The Flames of War Spread in Palestine; Jewish Forces Fiercely Attack the City of Jaffa; The Mayor of the City Has Telegraphed Cunningham Asking for British Troops to Intervene; It is Expected That the Arab Forces Will Not Be Able to Hold Out for Long

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 25th Broadcast: Arab leaders today agreed to suspend the withdrawal of Arab residents from Haifa. The Jewish side promised to send police to protect them and establish an Arab-Jewish committee to arbitrate disputes.

[Reuters, Tel Aviv, 25th] The Irgun, a Jewish underground group, began a general offensive on the Arab city of Jaffa, adjacent to Tel Aviv, on the morning of the 25th. The Jewish self-defense force, Haganah, stationed at the border between Jaffa and Tel Aviv, stood by and watched. After preparing all night, 3,000 Irgun troops crossed the border into Jaffa at night. Initial reports from the Jewish side stated that the Mensing Police Station and the railway station in Jaffa had been occupied by Irgun troops. Reports from the Arab side in Jaffa acknowledged that the Jewish army was launching unprecedentedly fierce wave-like attacks on the Arab defense lines. The Arab headquarters in Jaffa ordered all residents of the city to remain calm and unite to defend themselves. Jews in Tel Aviv estimated that there were about 10,000 Arab troops available to defend Jaffa, but believed that the Arabs would not be able to hold out for long. British officials in Jerusalem confirmed that the mayor of Jaffa had telegraphed High Commissioner Cunningham, asking for British troops to intervene. Jaffa is a purely Arab city and should belong to the Arab state according to the partition plan. Arab figures in Jerusalem firmly stated that the Arabs would never give up Jaffa and would fight to the last man. Jewish war reports indicated that the Arab defense works in Jaffa were on the verge of collapse and street fighting was expanding. King Abdullah of Jordan issued an emergency declaration in the country's capital, Amman, stating that the Irgun's attack on Jaffa had no strategic justification. He encouraged the Arabs to continue fighting and not to give up, as reinforcements were on the way. At the same time, the situation in Tel Aviv was also unclear. Some houses caught fire and were burning, and the transportation system was in complete chaos.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 25th] Jewish Agency officials said that the Irgun forces attacking Jaffa were becoming more and more courageous in battle, and the Arab army was fleeing to the suburban villages. It is expected that the Irgun forces will be able to completely occupy Jaffa by dawn on the 26th.

[United Press, Beirut, 24th] Authoritative sources said on the 24th that the Arab League had decided not to send regular troops into Palestine. The Arab League held a series of meetings in Amman this week and decided to place the Arab Liberation Army under the command of King Abdullah of Jordan. The Arab foreign legion under his command will launch attacks with the assistance of non-regular Arab forces from various countries. The reason the Arab League made this decision is that Jordan is the only Arab country not bound by the United Nations, while all other countries are members of the United Nations. The Arab League plans to temporarily occupy part of Palestine with the Arab foreign legion, and will begin action as soon as the British troops withdraw. Abdullah guarantees that the future withdrawal of troops will be decided by the Palestinian people themselves.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 24th] A dispatch from Haifa today said that the Jewish authorities are now planning to prevent 37,000 Arabs from withdrawing, believing that this withdrawal is a political rebellion. They have requested that the Arabs remain in the area to prove that they can live together with the Jews. The Jewish side is willing to cooperate in solving the food supply problem. However, Arab leaders replied, "We cannot be obedient citizens of the conquerors."

### I Deny Negotiating with the United States Regarding Sending Troops to the Holy Land; Britain, the United States, and France Discuss Simplifying the Holy Land Trusteeship Plan

[United Press, Lake Success, 24th] The Chinese delegation to the United Nations issued a formal statement on the 24th, denying that negotiations had been held in New York to discuss the possibility of sending a Chinese contingent to carry out the trusteeship of Palestine. However, this statement did not deny that such negotiations might have taken place elsewhere. (A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing refused to comment on this report, and observers believe that the negotiations may have taken place elsewhere).

[Reuters, Lake Success, 24th] British, American, and French representatives today discussed a simplified plan for the trusteeship of Palestine, so that it could be quickly adopted by the General Assembly as a transitional measure. The content of the simplified plan is not fundamentally different from the original plan proposed by the United States, only simplifying the procedure for establishing a provisional government in Palestine. Under this plan, the provisional government of Palestine will only have a governor assisted by an administrative committee. The governor has the right to establish other government agencies on his own if necessary, regardless of whether there are provisions in the trusteeship agreement. This simplified plan can be amended in the trusteeship agreement.

### Council of the Western European Union Holds Weekly Meeting; France and the Netherlands Discuss Military Cooperation

[Reuters, London, 24th] After holding its first meeting in London today, the permanent body of the Western European Union issued a communique announcing that the meeting had decided that the permanent body should hold a regular meeting once a week, and that extraordinary meetings should be held at any time if necessary. Today's meeting lasted less than an hour and discussed procedural issues. British Under-Secretary of State for War and Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defense Hollis also attended the meeting. The meeting also decided that the chairmanship should be held by the five countries in rotation every three months, and appointed the current Counselor of the Netherlands Embassy in London, Mr. Pothuisman, as the secretary of the permanent body.

[Reuters, The Hague, 24th] General Koenig, Commander-in-Chief of the French Occupation Forces in Germany, is visiting the Netherlands as part of military cooperation under the Western European Five-Nation Alliance. Mr. Koenig held a long conversation with General Krull, Commander-in-Chief of the Dutch Army, today to discuss military issues in Western Europe. Afterwards, Mr. Koenig said that the standardization of military equipment of the five countries is almost a factual necessity. Mr. Koenig also inspected the Dutch Army and praised the Dutch Army's new tank units. Later, he was received by Queen Wilhelmina, who awarded him the Grand Cross.

### Trial of Major Japanese War Criminals Concluded; Xiang Zhe Returns Home

Will Submit a Report to the Government

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] Xiang Zhejiong, the prosecutor of our country's prosecution office participating in the Far East International Military Tribunal for War Crimes, is scheduled to leave here by plane this evening and return to Shanghai and then to Nanjing, as the process of trying war criminals has come to an end. He will submit a full report to the government on the complete process of trying war criminals over the past two years. It is expected that Mr. Xiang will stay in China for three weeks and then come to Tokyo to await the issuance of the final judgment by the court on the 25 first-class Japanese war criminals.

### East-West Blocs Compete for Dominance in Europe; A New Struggle Will Begin; Secretary Marshall Meets with the President to Discuss the International Situation

[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall met with President Truman yesterday after returning to Washington from Bogota to review the current international situation. He will travel to his hometown in North Carolina for a short break this weekend.

[Reuters, London, 25th] Political figures believe that since Italy has joined the Western camp, the struggle between East and West for dominance in Europe will play out the next act in Germany. The Western countries have made significant progress in their political design in Europe. Now it is only waiting for the United States to clearly express its commitment to the efforts to consolidate Western Europe and how it intends to provide concrete support, especially in the military field.

The connection between Washington and the countries of Western Europe is still lacking. Judging from the remarks made by Prime Minister Spaak after returning from the United States, the United States sympathizes with the defense provisions of the Western European pact, but is not yet willing to publicly declare any concrete guarantees for it. It is reported that the United States requested the merger of the three Western German zones at the London Conference, but has not yet obtained the approval of France. France is unwilling for West Germany to join the Western European bloc until the United States can provide security guarantees. As the curtain is about to rise on the next struggle in Europe, the situation is clearly urgent. Marshall's hurried return from Bogota is related to breaking the stalemate in Western Europe itself.

### Three Foreign Ministers Meeting: Possible Convening

[United Press International, Washington, 24th] Secretary of State Marshall returned here today from Bogotá, hastily ending the "hot war" of the Pan-American Conference, to resume directing the American strategy in the global "anti-Soviet" Cold War. Marshall's return to the capital has led to general speculation that the US authorities will hold a meeting with Western leaders as soon as possible to plan new efforts to curb European communism backed by the Soviet Union. However, it is still unknown whether this meeting will be a gathering of Marshall and Western European figures such as British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault, and whether the meeting will proceed along diplomatic lines. It is expected that Marshall himself will review the situation and lay down the course of action for next week.

At that time, the bells of hundreds of churches across the country rang in unison as the copper coffin was slowly lowered into the ground, not far from the tomb of Quezon, the father of the Philippines.

Finally, a eulogy was delivered by Pope's representative, Biani, followed by a gun salute, the playing of Taps, and a final prayer for the repose of the soul. The funeral concluded, and the honor guard paused briefly in front of the Congress to receive public tribute, with the new President Quirino presiding over the ceremony and stating that the late President had dedicated his life to serving the country and that the Filipino people should unite and carry on his legacy, and that the friendship between the Philippines and the United States was unbreakable and their destinies inseparable. US Ambassador O'Neill, representing the diplomatic corps, said in his address that the death of a leader of a generation was mourned throughout the world, not limited to the Philippines alone.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The remains of the first President of the Philippines, Roxas, were buried today, and all agencies and organizations here flew flags at half-mast to mourn this friend of our country.

### Italian Cabinet Prepares for Reorganization: De Gasperi to Consult with Party Leaders; General Labor Confederation Calls for May Day Parade

[Reuters, Rome, 24th] Political sources say: Prime Minister De Gasperi will begin talks with party leaders on Tuesday to organize a new government. De Gasperi has gone to his country villa in Gondolfo to study the cabinet reorganization issue diligently over the weekend. According to the right-wing Milan Evening Post, De Gasperi will soon resign as leader of the Christian Democratic Party, and a new party leader will be elected when the party holds its next executive committee meeting. However, the Christian Democratic Party headquarters has officially denied this claim, stating that it will not allow De Gasperi to resign as chairman of the party. It is generally expected that the cabinet reorganization will not change the current party composition of the coalition cabinet, but only slightly alter it. In addition, a special ministry will be established to handle the Marshall Plan. The right-wing Social Unity Party supports this proposal and has nominated its leader, Longobardo, for this position. It is also said that the current Deputy Prime Minister and Budget Minister, as well as the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Fenoldi, may withdraw from the cabinet.

### Epidemics May Spread Rampantly This Summer: Anti-Epidemic Committee Sets Deadline of End of June to Complete 2 Million Vaccinations

[Our Own Dispatch] Director Rong of the Anti-Epidemic Department of the Ministry of Health once declared that cholera would be a pandemic in China this year. The Municipal Health Bureau also stated that the epidemic situation in the city was slightly reduced last year, but there is a possibility of a large-scale epidemic this year. The reason is that the number of refugees in the city is increasing daily, and the dirt and filth and living together in a chaotic place lead to the easy spread of epidemics. Therefore, this year's summer anti-epidemic work has been started earlier. The 45 teams of the Anti-Epidemic Committee Anti-Epidemic General Team have been dispatched to Zhabei, Yangshupu, and the shantytowns of the South City since the 19th of this month to inject cholera preventive vaccine for the poor, and they can inject about 10,000 people a day. The health offices in each district serve the people and factories, institutions, and organizations in the district. The Anti-Epidemic Committee plans to complete the vaccination of 2 million people by the end of June so that half of the citizens have immune preparation. In this way, even if there is a potential cholera outbreak, the epidemic situation can be easily controlled and will not spread.

DDT Teams Commence Work

The 200 workers recruited by the Anti-Epidemic Committee's DDT spraying team have completed their training. They will officially start work in two teams from this week. One team is stationed north of the Suzhou Creek, and the other is stationed south of the Suzhou Creek.

### Finding Barracks for Transient Recruits: Comfort Association Sets Three Principles

Fang Zhi, the resident chairman of the Shanghai City Reception and Comfort Committee for Troops Suppressing the Rebellion, stated that recently, new recruits have been frequently passing through the city, and there have been cases of occupying small temples and schools in the urban area. In order to maintain social order and promote military-civilian cooperation, he has stipulated that when the original fixed barracks are deemed insufficient and new barracks must be found, the following principles must be followed: (1) All temples must be re-examined and detailed by the Comfort Association, and the number of soldiers stationed in each temple must be specified. The principle is that temples in the urban area should not be used to station troops to avoid any impact. (2) The barracks for troops stationed are to be investigated by the Comfort Association, and the reception office will post signs stating "Temporary Barracks for Transient Troops Suppressing the Rebellion" for identification. (3) Before the construction of the reception center barracks is completed, tents and cots should be set up as much as possible in the open space of the center to reduce the number of people stationed in temples.

[Our Own Dispatch] Cai Longren, the commander of the Ninth Gendarmerie Regiment, and Zhou Zuozhen, the deputy commander, and other officers, who were transferred to Shanghai last month to take over the duties of the Third Independent Battalion of the Gendarmerie, hosted the local press corps at the New Life Club yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to report on the regiment's history and work, and to solicit guidance and assistance from local elders and social elites.

In October 1940, it moved to the Chuanqian Road area, serving as traffic control and military police. In the autumn of 1941, it was stationed in more than ten counties including Hechuan and Tongliang in northern Sichuan, guarding the capital and assisting in food management. In September 1945, it was ordered to return to the capital first. In the autumn of 1946, it was stationed on the Beijing-Shanghai line. In May 1947, the area of service extended to the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Zhejiang-Jiangxi lines. In March of this year, it was ordered to transfer to Shanghai. Currently, the deployment of troops is as follows: The First Battalion is responsible for duties south of the Suzhou Creek and in Pudong, and the Second Battalion is responsible for duties north of the Suzhou Creek. The 7th and 9th companies of the Third Battalion are stationed in Hangzhou with the regimental headquarters, and the 8th company is stationed in Jinhua and Yiwu, respectively serving as military police in Hangzhou and protecting trains and combating smuggling on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road. There is also a directly subordinate special detachment responsible for protecting trains on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines.

### Weng Zhong Blessing Brings Trouble: Police Station to Order Relocation

### Election of Bao Chief on Maigen Road: Two Factions Confront Each Other, Refusing to Give Way; More Than a Thousand Voters in a Brawl, More Than Thirty People Injured and Sent to Hospital

[Our Own Dispatch] Because the 8th Bao in Zhabei District is vast and difficult to manage, the district office was ordered to divide the 8th Bao into the 8th Bao and the 32nd Bao. A major dispute arose over the choice of Bao Chief. According to reports, most of the residents in the district are out-of-town households from Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and Anhui. At about 8:00 AM yesterday, the masses gathered at the Maigen Road Refugee Shelter to vote. The Shandong faction elected Zhou Qi as Bao Chief, and the northern Jiangsu faction elected Dai Jinbiao as Bao Chief. The voters on both sides formed opposing lines. At about 11:00 AM, the Shandong faction, seeing that Zhou Qi had no hope of being elected Bao Chief, prohibited voting for Dai Jinbiao, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. After a time of loud noise, a bloody battle broke out. More than a thousand voters fought each other with wooden sticks, bricks, and stones. After receiving a report, the Zhabei Police Branch, led by Branch Chief Zhou Si'an and Section Chief Shi, rushed to the scene in vehicles with dozens of uniformed and plainclothes police officers and a large number of police officers from the Police Corps to suppress the situation. The disturbance gradually subsided. It was reported that more than thirty people were injured on both sides, including Wang Ganwen and Tao Qingkui, who were all taken to the hospital for treatment by the police. As of dusk, the Bao Chief had not yet been elected.

### Coerced Confession? Extortion? Wen Guangting Accuses Police of Frame-Up; District Attorney's Office to Investigate Today

[Our Report] Wen Guangting, a foundry worker who was accused of theft by the police but acquitted by the court, and who remained in custody for an extended period before being released on bail, previously filed a complaint with the City Council, accusing police officers of extracting confessions through torture and judicial police of soliciting bribes. The president of the District Court, Cha Liangjian, has taken this matter very seriously. He recently transferred Wen's entire case file to the District Attorney's Office for investigation to uncover the truth. This morning, Prosecutor Liang Gengshun will open a hearing, summoning Wen Guangting, bailiff Xu Jingkuan, and Tian Abing, the owner of He Xing Foundry who acted as Wen's guarantor, for questioning.

Wen Guangting Claims He Was Kicked, Beaten, and Waterboarded

Regarding the allegations of police abuse and bailiff bribery, Wen Guangting told a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency yesterday that after his arrest, he was confined to a narrow iron cage. He requested permission to make a phone call to have a friend come and verify his identity, but this was denied. The torture began at 8:00 AM the day after his arrest. During interrogation, he refused to admit to being a thief and was slapped and kicked. He was then tied to a specially made bench about five or six feet long. During waterboarding, his eyes were first covered, then his mouth, and water was poured forcefully into his nose. This happened five or six times at the police station. He recalled that there were about three or four police officers present, one wearing a dark blue Chinese-style suit, and another wearing a blue serge coat. During the waterboarding, he was also whipped with a canvas belt. The theft case was heard four times, but the plaintiff never appeared in court. After being released on bail, his friend, Tian Liangquan, a worker at the De Tai Iron Works, went to the court with the bail bond. Due to unfamiliarity with the procedures and a missing case number (Criminal Special Character No. 99), a bailiff told Tian that if he were willing to offer "cigarette money," he could find a way to locate the number. Tian initially offered 40,000 yuan, which was later increased to 60,000 yuan. During the bail procedure, someone said that if he was willing to pay 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, he could leave immediately. Another matter involved a request for an additional 5 million yuan. Regarding the Hu Xing Foundry's statement that he was fired three days before his arrest, Wen said that he was arrested on January 14th, and the factory paid his wages on the 13th. He believes the factory made this statement to avoid being implicated, fearing potential troubles. It was also learned that Zhu Qiaobin, who claimed to have been robbed of galoshes, a foot basin, and a kerosene stove by Wen Guangting, told reporters yesterday that he had indeed been robbed of these items. He said he was told by someone from the police station that Wen Guangting had confessed to stealing them.

### Yang Jingzhou's Peculiar Words and Actions Before Disappearance; Taiwan Police Department Investigates Passenger Ship; Chief Mate and Passengers Describe What They Saw

[Report from Taipei, 25th] Regarding the disappearance of Yang Jingzhou, a reporter accompanied Lin Yuanlong, an attaché of the Criminal Investigation Brigade of the Provincial Police Department, and Chen Jiankang of the Criminal Investigation Section, to Keelung today to visit the passenger ship and conduct an on-site investigation. Chief Mate Huang Haobo answered various questions. According to him, Yang purchased a steerage ticket. Due to a severe storm shortly after leaving Keelung, steerage passengers were unable to stay in their cabins, so Yang sat with other passengers in the main dining room. Around 2:00 AM on the 10th, several passengers saw him go outside, but they didn't think much of it. The ship was still sailing in the waters off Taiwan at the time. The next morning, on the 11th, it was discovered that he had not returned, and his bag was found on the dining table. The Chief Mate was notified, and a search was conducted, but he was nowhere to be found. At that time, the ship was sailing in the waters off Zhejiang. Inside the bag were a Bible, a diary, and several business cards, as well as 900 Taiwan dollars. The diary contained alarming entries. Huang also said that because the ship was in a dangerous situation after Yang boarded, there was no time to check tickets, and Yang did not purchase an additional ticket. When asked if there was a possibility he was hiding, Tang insisted there was absolutely no such possibility. He also inspected the safety equipment on the deck and in the restrooms, which was found to be quite adequate, so it seemed unlikely that he had accidentally fallen overboard.

Claimed His Ticket Was Torn

At this time, they encountered Wu Heming, a passenger who had been in close contact with Yang before the incident. According to Wu, he saw crew members checking tickets at the entrance when Yang boarded the ship. Because Yang did not have a ticket, he was initially prevented from boarding. However, Yang explained that his ticket had been torn by someone at the sugar factory and offered to purchase another ticket, so he was allowed to board. Moreover, Yang seemed to be mentally disturbed at the time, repeatedly shouting "I am a good person," and "Dying on the shore is the same as dying on the ship." However, the passenger ship company did not confirm this information. The Xing He Company also denied tearing Yang's ticket. As for the incident where Yang was surrounded at the pier, Wu also said he did not see it.

Criticized for Mentioning the Cost of Living Index

Wu also provided detailed information about Yang's behavior after boarding the ship. Yang announced to the passengers that after arriving in Taiwan, he had spoken to workers at the sugar factory about the fact that workers' wages in Shanghai were calculated based on the cost of living index, which led to criticism from the company for inappropriate comments. When he announced this, he repeatedly stated: "I am a Christian, not a communist." The passengers all found Yang's words strange and were secretly surprised by them. Yang also sat in the wrong seat and was confronted by a soldier. Yang replied, "Even if I sit here, I won't be sitting for long." Based on the combined investigation, it seems beyond doubt that Yang Jingzhou is dead. However, it remains to be seen whether it was suicide or murder, and further research is needed. The Provincial Police Department has resolved to thoroughly investigate this case.

### Visiting the Agricultural Exhibition in Fuxing Park; Dark Straw Huts and Old Farm Tools; The Agricultural Crisis Deserves Attention

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] China has always been known as an agricultural country, with 80% of the population engaged in agriculture. However, today's domestic food production cannot meet the demand, and it is necessary to rely on large-scale imports from foreign countries, which shows the state of agricultural production. Most people who grow up in the city are very unfamiliar with everything in the countryside. This time, the Chinese Agricultural Science Research Society held its first agricultural exhibition in Fuxing Park, allowing the citizens of Shanghai to learn about things they didn't know in the past. As written on the wooden plaque at the entrance of the venue: "Looking at the countryside from the agricultural exhibition, thinking about agriculture from the countryside, thinking about farmers from agriculture, every grain is hard-earned, every drop is blood and sweat!"

The content of the exhibition can be said to be rich, divided into food, clothing, housing, transportation, live livestock and poultry, agriculture and science, agriculture and industry, agricultural machinery, agricultural photos, rural conditions, flower gardening, tropical plants, and other sections. Under the systematic organization of many physical objects, diagrams, models, and explanations, the audience can gain a lot of agricultural knowledge. If you carefully visit from beginning to end systematically, you really feel that you benefit more than reading a year of Agricultural Science Overview at the university.

The farm implements displayed at the venue range from the old ox-powered waterwheel and wheelbarrow for transportation to the new American-style pump water pumps, diggers, tractors, and flour mills. These are all of interest to Shanghai citizens, even though there are several centuries of difference between them. The oxcart is written with "Our ancestors' great invention, but unfortunately the descendants have not improved it." Today, Chinese farmers are still using it to irrigate fields, and comparing it with those foreign farm implements, you can understand why China's agricultural production is so backward.

What is the life of Chinese farmers today? There is a low thatched hut in the venue, the scene inside is dark, the furnishings are simple, an old farmer made of paper is lying in broken cotton and straw because of illness, and a young one is eating alone at the table, eating yellow millet bran and a bowl of green vegetables, and there is a high-interest loan IOU on the table. This scene vividly depicts the tragic life of most farmers today. Visitors are very interested in this thatched hut: "This is the home of 350 million compatriots!"

Today, Chinese farmers rely entirely on their innate physical strength, use tools from the primitive era, and mainly rely on water and drought, and insect disasters; safety, exploitation, and fear are often bad. China's agricultural production is either unscientific or primitive, and it is also declining. Many fields are deserted, many river channels are silted up, and many draft animals are slaughtered without replenishment. Agricultural science youths who come out of schools not only have no work to do in rural areas, but also have no work to do in urban agricultural agencies. The widespread mismatch between learning and application and the inability to study with peace of mind will make it impossible for Chinese agriculture to progress.

The purpose and significance of this exhibition, which the Chinese Agricultural Science Research Society spent more than one billion yuan on under difficult economic conditions, is to hope that people in society will pay attention to the importance of agriculture, recognize the crisis of agriculture today, and then actively seek ways to improve it. "Face the agricultural crisis"! I hope that the citizens who have visited will be alerted.

### Sino-Japanese Barter; Four Ships to Sail to Japan

[Our Report] The transportation work for Sino-Japanese barter is undertaken by four companies: China Merchants, China Xing, Yi Xiang, and China Shipping. The China Merchants Bureau's Haiji ship is currently berthed at Dagu, loading more than 2,000 tons of raw peanuts, soybeans, and bran, and will sail to Kobe as soon as it is fully loaded. The China Xing Company's Yongxing ship is scheduled to sail to Japan at the end of this month, carrying 485 boxes of flavor essence from Shanghai, and then going to Qingdao to load 1,250 tons of raw peanuts, all of which will be transported to Japan. There are also 10,000 tons of salt, which are currently being transported to Taiwan by the China Shipping Company's Australia ship and the Yi Xiang Company's Lini ship to load and transport to Japan. After unloading the above materials in Japan, the ships will load reparations and return to China. The China Trade Bureau is also exchanging 20,000 tons of coal for 21,000 tons of Japanese timber. The coal will soon be shipped from Qinhuangdao.

### Should Judicial Officials Have Party Membership? Joint Petition to the Court for Instructions

[Our Report] The Kuomintang party departments in various places are urging party members to register, and many judicial officials in various places are members of the Kuomintang. In principle, they should register immediately. However, Article 80 of the Constitution stipulates: "Judges must be independent of parties, make judgments independently based on the law, and not be subject to any interference." Therefore, after the implementation of the Constitution, judicial officials cannot have party membership so that they can handle cases impartially and selflessly. There is a question of how to proceed with the party member registration. Registering would be inconsistent with the Constitution, and not registering would be a violation of party discipline, creating a sense of disorientation. Judicial officials in this city have jointly submitted a petition to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for instructions. The Ministry of Judicial Administration has not been able to decide on this matter and is submitting it to the Executive Yuan for instructions.

General Prices

### Initial Week's Trend Holds Strong, Enters Later Stage of Downward Trend

Last week, prices, following the fatigue of the previous week, showed signs of movement on Monday, with general trends becoming favorable amidst frequent positive news, especially for stocks and general financial commodities. From Tuesday onwards, as positive news failed to materialize, holders eager to protect their profits sold off, leading to a general decline once again. Subsequently, a period of consolidation ensued, with many prices nearing their levels from the previous weekend by the end of the week. Credit conditions remained loose last week, with the National Bank's bill exchange fluctuating. Interest rates, except for a drop to 2.55% on Friday, remained steady between 2.6% and 2.7%. In the late stages of inflation, people's psychology is extremely fragile, and price fluctuations are highly susceptible to external influences, with reactions being particularly sensitive. This characteristic has been repeatedly discussed in this publication. Last week's prices surged on Monday and declined on Tuesday, with trends reversing within a day. This trend fully demonstrates the aforementioned characteristic and the prominence of speculative motives. The reasons for these rapid fluctuations are listed below:

Regarding the surge in prices on Monday: (1) The most recent adjustment of exchange rates began on April 6th, the second week before last week. At that time, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee raised various exchange rates by 25% to 27%. The benchmark price for US dollars rose to 324,000 yuan, an increase of 69,000 yuan, while the British pound rose to 972,000 yuan, an increase of 207,000 yuan. Exchange rates for Hong Kong dollars and Indian rupees were also increased. Since the second half of last year, the cycle of price increases has shortened, and the speed has accelerated. Therefore, the government's foreign exchange rates must be adjusted from time to time to keep pace. As of last Monday, the government's foreign exchange rates had been stable for more than two weeks, and the difference from black market exchange rates naturally increased day by day. Rumors of adjustment began the week before last and extended to last Monday. General speculation suggested that it was inevitable. With rumors rampant, prices were stimulated to rise; (2) The Hong Kong gold exchange market serves as an indicator of the value of legal tender, and the value of foreign stocks is closely related to the Hong Kong dollar. Therefore, fluctuations in the Hong Kong exchange rate have a very sensitive impact on price fluctuations. Last Monday, when the Hong Kong gold exchange market opened, the price of one million legal tender dropped sharply from 8.67 Hong Kong dollars at the end of the previous week to 8 Hong Kong dollars. The news was a powerful factor stimulating price increases; (3) Recently, prices have gradually stabilized after the major price surge in the second week of March. In the first two weeks of April, the overall wholesale price index rose by less than 4%. In this sluggish situation, sales for industrial and commercial sectors were slow, while expenses could not be reduced. Furthermore, workers' wages still had to be calculated according to the cost of living index, creating a hardship where they had to rely on price increases to survive. Given these circumstances, once the opportunity arose, speculators fanned the flames, deliberately driving up prices and creating a price surge; (4) In the cotton yarn and cloth sector, under the above stimuli, purchases from Tianjin, Guangdong, and Hubei further boosted the market, adding fuel to the fire. From Tuesday onwards, general prices fell sharply again. The reasons that can be stated are: (1) Rumors of extended foreign exchange releases did not materialize. Recently, the foreign exchange management authorities have been quite distressed about this. Raising prices would stimulate inflation and draw criticism from all sides, while low prices would make it impossible to absorb foreign exchange funds, leading to overseas remittances evading regulations, hindering exports, and rampant smuggling, putting them in a dilemma; (2) After the sharp increase on Monday, many parties, having profited, reconsidered and sold off; (3) With the situation of inflation worsening day by day, the more currency issued, the lower the purchasing power, leading to sluggish sales and a lack of purchasing power; (4) The regulations for issuing short-term treasury bills were officially announced by the National Government last Monday, and it was reported that the National Bank would organize a special committee to handle the matter, preparing to entrust brokers to auction them at 85% of their face value on the stock exchange. This appeared to be imminent, diverting investment targets, and strengthening the sellers' sentiment; (5) In the cotton yarn and cloth sector, the China Textile Corporation allocated and sold as many as 40 types of cloth, with no increase or decrease compared to the previous period, leading to a resurgence of short-selling and a downward trend in prices. In addition, regarding the government's price measures last week, the following can be mentioned: First, Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated at a press conference held by the News Bureau of the Executive Yuan last week that the Chinese government had considered establishing an agency under the Executive Yuan to decide on policies regarding US aid. At the same time, existing institutions handling urban food supply, cotton, and oil would be fully utilized for the actual administrative work of the aid program to China. Second, the Ministry of Finance previously promulgated implementation measures for the management of remittances and cash transportation between Shanghai and Guangzhou. Recently, two points were added to the scope of cash transportation use in Article 4 of the measures, with the intention of ensuring that commercial firms could only transfer funds for genuine working capital needs, preventing speculative activities under false pretenses. Third, since the order to stop deferred settlement of Chinese stocks, banks and trust companies operating group arbitrage as legal brokers have converted their original arbitrage into weekly deposits. According to investigations, the amount absorbed is estimated to be around two trillion yuan. The Financial Management Bureau is paying close attention to how these weekly savings deposits are used by various banks. In addition to transferring these funds to industry and commerce and the National Bank, they are investigating whether they are being used for speculation. Fourth, the fluctuation of rice market prices depends on whether the Civil Food Allocation Committee decides to purchase. Prices rise upon hearing of purchases and stabilize upon hearing of cessation. According to officials of the committee, rationing by population was originally a trial measure. The food supply for April, May, and June has already been prepared. The food supply for the next period, July, August, and September, seems to be still unresolved. The only option is to purchase from the market, but given the current environment, this is a major undertaking, and the committee cannot act rashly. Recently, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to the capital to report on this matter. It is said that a result has been achieved. Furthermore, after rationing rice, the committee is now implementing rationing of oil. It is planned to extend the rationing of coal from May onwards, with the purchase procedures being the same as for rice. Fifth, in the past, national banks and bureaus have maintained a low-interest rate policy for deposits and loans. This practice has long been criticized by most economists, with more disadvantages than advantages. The authorities have also realized the inappropriateness of this traditional approach and are seeking reforms. Recently, it has been reported that the Joint Treasury has decided to adjust interest rates in a gradual manner, aiming to approach the market's shadow interest rates within a reasonable period.

Under the aforementioned circumstances, last week's price movements were large and rapid, but after Tuesday, they gradually stabilized, trending downwards. In the stock market, the market opened strongly on Monday amidst numerous positive rumors. The Shanghai stock market broke through the 2,100 mark for Wing On Textile, and ten stocks, including China Cement and China興業, reached their limit. Details are described in the stock market section of this publication below. In the cotton yarn and cloth market, people's sentiment was also greatly stimulated. Buying was strong, with 42-count Blue Phoenix reaching 240 million, an increase of 6 million compared to the previous weekend. 20-count Double Horse reached 144 million, an increase of 9 million compared to the previous weekend. Leader fine cloth rose to 5.16 million, closing at 5.02 million. However, from Tuesday onwards, the good times did not last. Except for Leader fine cloth, which briefly reached 5.2 million and closed at 4.94 million, 42-count Blue Phoenix fell back to 235 million, and 20-count Double Horse fell back to 138 million. Subsequently, the trend was downward, with mixed results compared to the closing price of the previous weekend, with little difference. Regarding rice, the market opened on Monday with news of falling rice prices in Wuxi and an increase in arrivals. Sales were sluggish, and prices fell slightly. In the southern market, premium white rice fell by 50,000 yuan compared to the previous weekend to 3.7 million yuan per shi. On Tuesday, due to rising rice prices in Wuxi and rumors of the Civil Adjustment Committee purchasing surplus rice, prices rose to 3.8 million yuan. Subsequently, rice prices in Wuxi gradually stabilized, and the Civil Adjustment Committee sold substandard white rice in the market, returning to 3.7 million yuan on Thursday. The fluctuation range was not significant, remaining within 100,000 yuan. Miscellaneous grains and cooking oil followed rice, with similar trends. Daily necessities such as soap and matches only experienced slight price fluctuations due to sluggish sales.

### Monetary Finance

(1) Credit Conditions and Shadow Interest Rates

This week, it was hoped that credit conditions in the city would tighten from loose, but this did not materialize due to the following reasons: First, the short-term treasury bills were delayed; Second, although the finished products purchased by the China Trust Bureau were auctioned, the payment was not yet due; Third, funds from the North continued to flow south. It was reported that funds from Northeast Japan flowing into China had reached over one trillion, and the route was generally from Tianjin to Shanghai. Fourth, because financial commodities in Guangzhou were temporarily higher than in the city, some funds flowed back into the city last week; Fifth, general prices showed signs of stability and sluggishness due to stagnant sales, so goods firms were mostly watching and seeking funds was not enthusiastic; Sixth, government spending remained high as before, and state-owned banks were continuously withdrawing funds from Tuesday onwards. These factors were the main reasons for the continued loose credit conditions last week. If short-term treasury bills can be issued on schedule this week and the auction proceeds from the finished products can be recovered one after another, credit conditions may tighten across the board.

From Monday to Friday last week, the exchange results of national banks showed a net inflow of 480.7 billion, but if the 920 billion in fixed deposits of commercial banks in the National Bank over the five days is deducted, the actual net outflow of national banks was 439.3 billion.

In commercial banks, because there were few demanders and the supply of funds was abundant, interbank lending was greatly reduced, and seeking loans was very convenient. Shadow interest rates generally stood at 2.7%, although they briefly rose to 3% for one or two days on Monday and Tuesday, but soon fell back to the original level. The exchange results of firms after the 60th numbered firms showed a total net outflow of 10.539 trillion from Monday to Friday. Although the outflow was large, the firms also delivered more than 400 billion in cash to the National Bank in the five days, which shows the abundance of the supply of funds. Last week, the external interest rate for securities firms, from Monday to Wednesday, was that the buying side posted an increase from 22 yuan to 33 yuan per share, and the selling side posted an increase from 19 yuan to 20 yuan per share, but after Wednesday, it decreased repeatedly. On Friday, the buying side only posted 21 yuan, and the selling side was as low as 18 yuan.

Foreign banks had a total net inflow of 843.8 billion in five days. The net inflow of 289.4 billion on Tuesday alone set a record. Although the premium for Guangzhou exchange fell last week, the advance of foreign firms increased without decreasing. The severe southward flow of funds and the paths it took, as demonstrated by this, are noteworthy.

(Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates)

Last week, the premium for Guangzhou exchange in domestic exchange markets fell repeatedly. On Tuesday, it even fell to a premium of 20 yuan per thousand yuan. On other days, it was only around 30 or 40 yuan. It is said that this was caused by the high prices of financial commodities in Guangzhou and the reverse flow of funds. In addition, it is related to the increase of foreign banks and the southward flow of US dollar short-term treasury bills. Although the paths of funds fleeing south are different, the large amounts are still noteworthy. The premium for Qingdao exchange also continued to decrease from 150 yuan per thousand yuan on Monday to 120 yuan on Friday. The premium for Chongqing exchange remained stable at 10 yuan for five days. The premium for Hankou exchange also decreased from 40 yuan to 20 yuan. The discount for Tianjin exchange once reached 130 yuan on Monday and Tuesday, which is said to be related to the fact that more than one trillion in funds from the Northeast are coming south via Tianjin.

Last week, the foreign exchange benchmark rate was not raised. However, the Hong Kong Shanghai exchange rate still showed a decrease. On Tuesday, it once decreased sharply to 73 cents in Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to 100,000 yuan in legal tender. Although it increased slightly after Wednesday, it was still shorter than the previous week. The market price of Hong Kong banknotes was about 5.7 Hong Kong dollars. The range of fluctuation was within 5 cents in Hong Kong dollars.

(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

Recently, the Chinese stock market has been hovering in a sluggish situation. Last week, credit conditions were loose and the Hong Kong exchange rate also contracted, but the overall appearance was still sluggish, and the market had little stimulus from buying interest. Coupled with the widespread rumors that treasury bills would soon be issued, and credit conditions were expected to tighten, new buyers were mostly watching, and long positions were also willing to sell, resulting in a general sluggish situation for various stocks during the week. Trading was also very quiet. Although Wing On Textile broke through the 2,000 yuan mark again at the beginning of the week, it subsequently weakened. Thus, comparing the closing price on Friday last week with the opening price at the end of the previous week, Wing On Textile showed a gain of 10%, Jinglun had no change, China Silk and China Cement only had a gain of 3%, and Xin Yi actually fell by 7%. If comparing the closing price on Friday last week with the beginning of Monday, various stocks showed a general decline of about 10%.

Foreign stocks suddenly strengthened on Monday. Ewo Silk rose to 2.96 million yuan, an increase of 250,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. The reason was that the Hong Kong exchange rate contracted and there were rumors of foreign exchange liberalization, resulting in improved sentiment, dry-up of floating shares, and soaring market prices. British-American Tobacco was 3.45 million yuan, and Jardine Matheson was 6.7 million yuan, all showing compensation. However, by Wednesday, due to reports of tight credit conditions, the cotton cloth returned, and financial commodities fell, Ewo Silk also fell back from its high price, closing at 2.75 million yuan. British-American Tobacco was 3.28 million yuan, and Jardine Matheson was 6.48 million yuan. On Wednesday, because foreign exchange was not raised, market prices hovered and waited, with minimal rises and falls. By Thursday, the situation was slightly stronger because retail investors absorbed some, and Ewo Silk rose again to 2.8 million yuan. British-American Tobacco was around 3.3 million yuan, and Jardine Matheson was 6.4 million yuan. On Friday, it had become a consolidated market, with minimal movements. The weekend was also sluggish. In short, this weekend, due to the downward movement of foreign exchange rates, sentiment was dimmed, transactions were sparse, and market prices were difficult to boost.

### Industrial and Commercial Dynamics

(1) How will the "stalemate" in Sino-Japanese trade be broken?

Since last week, there have been many reports of Sino-Japanese private trade, which has been in a stalemate for a long time, showing signs of becoming more active. According to a report from the Central News Agency in Tokyo on the 19th, Tang Juying, a representative of the trade group of the Chinese delegation to Japan, believes that the 10 billion yuan debt owed by the China Trust Bureau in Sino-Japanese trade is the main reason for the stalemate in Sino-Japanese trade, and the Allied Headquarters is even opposed to offsetting this debt with reparations in kind to China. In this case, within the China Trust Bureau's plan for this year to export 20,000 tons of soybeans, 5,000 tons of soybean oil, 500,000 piculs of soybean cake, 30,000 piculs of peanuts, 50 piculs of salt, and 10,000 piculs of raw hides to Japan, a portion must be deducted for debt repayment. Outside the scope of government trade, private individuals are only allowed to operate a few items such as hemp, tung oil, bran, pig iron, and medicinal materials, and it is estimated that the trade volume is less than one-tenth of the total trade volume. The trade method is to adopt a bookkeeping and signing method through regulatory agencies, that is, as agreed by Madge, director of the Economic and Scientific Group of the Allied Headquarters, to use the method of bartering to make up for the shortage of foreign exchange. It is reported that the second batch of 12 representatives of private trade to Japan will go to Japan in batches within days. On the 21st, the representatives held a meeting in the city and decided to replace competition with cooperation and planned to export large quantities of agricultural products.

Judging from various signs, if trade with Japan will gradually become active in the future, then under the policy of the United States deliberately supporting Japan, the situation of "an industrial Japan and an agricultural China" may still remain. Not only that, but China's national industry in the midst of storms and turmoil will inevitably suffer further destruction from Japanese industry. First, in terms of the government authorities of both sides, the China Trust Bureau of China plans to ship a large number of agricultural products to Japan this year, and the Japanese Trade Agency is also planning to exchange 1 million tons of steel for manganese ore and silicon ore of equal value (Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th). According to Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 23rd, more than 8,000 tons of iron ore from Hainan Island, China, are re-exported to supply Yawata Steel Works. As for the production equipment generally expected, such as steel pipes for construction, steel plates, and steel wire for textiles, it is reported that "Japan does not yet have the ability to export." From this, it can also be seen that China's exports to Japan are still mainly raw materials, while Japan's exports to China are, at best, finished products for direct consumption. Undoubtedly, China's industrial circles will suffer a serious blow!

From the telegram from Washington on the 21st, it was learned that the US Export-Import Bank has announced that the bank will jointly lend 660,000 US dollars to three commercial banks to help Japan purchase American cotton. Although it was once rumored in London that the British and American textile industries recently agreed to reduce Japan's cotton textile industry, the US Department of the Army believes that there is no reason. In today's America, where soldiers control politics, Japan's fate is naturally decided by the US military. Japan's textile industry is thriving. According to the recent report of the Japan Textile Industry Association, Japan's cotton spinning industry reached 3.1 million spindles in May, an increase of more than 26,000 spindles compared to February (Reuters, Tokyo, 19th). What is the end result of the increase in spindles and the input of gold dollars? The end result is that as of the end of January this year, Japan's cotton cloth inventory had reached 312 million square yards, worth about 150 million US dollars. At the same time, Japan's textile industry, due to rumors that it can import 1.3 million bales of American cotton within the US fiscal year from July this year to promote work, is now considering how to deal with these 312 million square yards of inventory. China, due to its vastness and poverty, is indeed a good target for dealing with this inventory. At a time when the "stalemate" in trade with Japan is about to "soften," it is worth noting by Chinese people, especially the Chinese textile industry.

(2) Can the prices of public utilities be stabilized?

The "leading price increase" of public utilities seems to have aroused the attention of the senators. The Council formally telegraphed the Executive Yuan on the 17th, requesting it to quickly consider stopping the continued application of the price calculation formula for public utilities, restoring the subsidy policy, and requesting the authorities to stop applying this formula from May onwards before an appropriate solution is decided, so as to avoid the serious consequences of causing social unrest. In addition to telegraphing the superiors to express "public opinion," the Senate also decided to form groups to investigate in order to clarify responsibilities. This may have busied the municipal administration of this city. The Director of the Public Utilities Bureau specially visited President Zhang of the Central Bank on the 16th, and there were talks between President Zhang and Mayor Wu on the morning of the 19th. It is said that they all unanimously discussed how to prevent the prices of public utilities from rising sharply. It seems that the municipal authorities understand the logic of price increases in this way: the main costs of public utilities are foreign exchange, hardware raw materials, fuel, and the cost of living index. Therefore, if the government can continue to adopt a subsidy policy for public utilities, there will be no further sharp increases in the future. Therefore, the main point of consultation between the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau and the President of the Central Bank is how to settle foreign exchange for fuel oil and gasoline in advance. The Fuel Management Committee also believes that allocating the coal needed by public utilities in advance will also help stabilize the prices of public utilities. It is said that the Central Bank has, in principle, approved lending for the funds needed by public utilities for early settlement of foreign exchange, etc. In that case, the "stability of May" can be achieved without problems. All these measures and theories are obviously based on the formula "one thing's price increase is because another thing's price increase" is established, but common sense can explain that this is a circular formula. The price increase of public utilities is indeed partly due to the stimulation of the rising cost of living index, but how can it be seen that the sharp rise in the cost of living index is not affected by the price increase of public utilities! The subsidy policy can indeed stabilize the prices of public utilities for a while, but the fiscal deficit increased due to the subsidy cannot but be a major factor in the general price increase. The circular formula will still bring about a circular effect. Anyway, the facts will give the most ruthless test!

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 25th] After the students of Xinhua Vocational School beat the principal of Jian Normal School, the students of the school had a dispute with the Xinhua police.

### Zhang Yi Returns from Nanjing to Shanghai to Handle Fudan Student Unrest

[Our Newspaper Report] Last weekend, some students at Fudan University announced a strike to protest the illegal search by plainclothes officers. All classes are scheduled to resume today. President Zhang Yi returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning and met with heads of various departments and directors of relevant departments at his private residence to hear reports on the incident. He immediately decided to notify all professors and teachers to abide by the decision of the administrative meeting some days ago, "During the period when students are brewing a strike or some students are on strike, professors should still go to school to teach." This notice was sent out separately last night; and he ordered the workers to clean up all the slogans and bulletins posted by the students, and the whole school should restore normal order. It is reported that the striking students are paying close attention to President Zhang's handling attitude, and will submit various protests and demands to Zhang today, and ask the school to recognize the "General Assembly of Department Representatives" or ask the school to allow the restoration of the Student Union, one of the two must be obtained:

[Another Report] The Fudan Journalism Society will hold a general meeting this afternoon to answer questions about the responsibility for the strike. It is reported that some members will refuse to attend. Chen Wangdao, the director of the department, is deeply saddened by the fact that the students of the department have worked hard for several years, but suddenly other problems have arisen.

### Chongqing University Students March in Rain; Professor's Wife Slapped; Express Unanimous Support

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 25th] Zhao Quantian, director of the Department of Political Science at Chongqing University, and Ke Zhao, a professor in the Department of Mathematics, have been neighbors in the Chongqing University dormitory for more than a year. At 1:00 PM on the 17th, Zhao was taking a nap. Ke personally knocked on the door and asked Zhao to come out for a talk. Zhao did not suspect anything and followed him to Ke's room. Ke suddenly changed his expression and sternly accused Zhao of being wrong. Ke's younger sister also spoke harshly from the side. Zhao's wife, Liu Yitao, heard the news and immediately went to inquire about the reason. Ke immediately angrily ordered two female servants to drag Liu out and then slapped her in the face. Liu was already in her fifties, and her face immediately became red and swollen, and her teeth loosened. Zhao, who is a Christian, did not fight back and helped Liu back to his residence. Later, Wang Qingxuan, a female assistant teacher in the Department of Mathematics, spread malicious rumors everywhere in the school, which eventually made Zhao unable to bear it. It is reported that this incident occurred because Ke overstepped the boundary in the dormitory and placed jars, obstructing the passage, which caused Zhao's dissatisfaction. Neither professor has taught since the incident. Ke also serves as the Dean of Academic Affairs of the Sichuan Provincial College of Education and has moved his entire family to the college in Ciqikou. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, students from Northeast University of Law and Business took a special military vehicle to Xiaolongkan to join students from Chongqing University and Rich City Middle School. Because Zhao taught at each of the schools, the students first expressed their condolences to Liu, and then marched in the rain to the suburbs to express their support. The order was orderly and rare. Zhao told a reporter from this newspaper that he did not want the situation to escalate and is now waiting for President Zhang Hongyuan to return from Nanjing to Chongqing to resolve the matter.

### Xiong Qinglai Talks About Recent Developments at Yunnan University; Striving for Progress in Stability; Special Mission is to Accept Overseas Chinese Students from Southeast Asia

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Xiong Qinglai, President of National Yunnan University, spoke to reporters on the 25th about the school's recent developments and development plans. He said that the school is organized into five colleges, fifteen departments, eleven specialized courses, and one affiliated middle school. There are 1,200 students in the university and 600 students in the affiliated middle school. The facilities have a considerable foundation, especially the departments of mining and metallurgy, biology, etc., but they cannot yet be said to be substantial. The professors are generally well-qualified and there are many famous teachers. The students also have a good attitude towards studying. Currently, special attention is being paid to the stability of the lives of teachers and students, and progress is being sought in stability. In addition to vigorously promoting teaching work, efforts are also being made to cultivate a research atmosphere in the hope of promoting Southwest culture. After the restoration, Yunnan University has a special mission, which is to accommodate the children of overseas Chinese from Yunnan's neighboring countries such as Myanmar, Annam, Thailand, and Southeast Asia, and to seek contact with these countries in terms of academic culture. Many overseas Chinese students have entered Yunnan University during the Anti-Japanese War, and more convenience will be given to them in the future to encourage them. Recently, Yangon University has contacted Yunnan University to borrow professors, and Vietnam has also sent more than a dozen students to Yunnan University this year.

### Biological Science in Shanghai

— Jingyi

Biology is the most rapidly developing science of the 20th century. Besides studying the problems of life, it has also opened up new avenues for agriculture, industry, and medicine. In the past two decades, its connection with physics and chemistry, its mutual advancement, is an even more valuable path. The number of people engaged in biological science research in our country is not small. There are many specialized research institutions, such as the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute in Beiping, the Beiping Research Institute, the Biological Research Institute of the Science Society of China, and the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the Academia Sinica. Most universities also have departments of animal husbandry. Many people are sent abroad every year to engage in specialized research. Biology in China should have a vigorous and hopeful future. Indeed, this science is too close to everyone's life. It has a direct relationship with the national economy and the people's livelihood. However, in fact, most people have not deeply recognized its importance, thinking that the study of flowers, birds, insects, and fish is only a scholarly embellishment. Therefore, biology in China is still in its infancy, and to this day it is only "a subject" in school education. Some people think that current biological research cannot affect the masses, and it is not visible in society. Under such circumstances, we feel that the establishment of a society is imperative. Therefore, we established the "Shanghai Biological Society" to meet the needs of this time and place, and with the support of the local educational community, we have set a work plan. For the past two months, we have been actively promoting the society's affairs (the address is 200 Yongkang Road), adhering to the serious attitude of science and the spirit of seeking truth, and striving to move forward.

The basic members of the Biological Society are mostly biology teachers from various middle schools, so greater gains can be made in improving teaching and popularizing biological knowledge. We know that experts conduct in-depth exploration, focusing on the discovery of new knowledge and principles. At the same time, it is also essential to transmit this knowledge to the majority of people and put it into practice, and perhaps even more important than advanced research. Our main tasks are: (1) research on theories and techniques of biological science; (2) introduction of the development of biological science and its teaching in various countries; (3) collection, compilation, and research on methods of improving teaching materials and experiments in biology; (4) collection of biological science books, specimens, and research materials; (5) editing and publishing of biological science materials. These five key points not only directly contribute to the improvement of teaching but also affect the promotion of biological science, at least raising the general public's attention and interest in biology.

Today, cultural workers are all suffocated by the pressure of life, but the several people in charge of the Biological Society seem to have forgotten these things, working energetically and enthusiastically. On the one hand, they receive strong encouragement from the education authorities, and on the other hand, advanced figures in the biological community also extend a helping hand to support them. Therefore, every member of this society is like a bee busy working on a rose, pollinating, making honey, and benefiting society. This symbol is indeed very meaningful. It is said that they have engraved this profound meaning into their emblem as a symbol of the society. The society has joined the Science Society of China as a group member, which has provided more practical assistance. They have hired Bing Zhi, Lu Yudao, Liu Cheng, Wang Zhijia, and Wang Jiaji as honorary directors, hoping that they will provide guidance at any time. At the same time, they also hope to establish contact with various schools to further expand the scope.

They are planning to edit a series of books, focusing on general biology, life problems, human physiology, and increased production technology. Academic lectures have already been given by Mr. Bing Zhi at Guanghua University, and they are still being held. They do not want to work on popularizing biological knowledge to the public, and are preparing to cooperate with the Mass Education Experimental School, or use broadcasting to promote it. These tasks require time and effort to achieve, but they only ask about cultivation and do not consider how to harvest.

The improvement of biological teaching is an urgent matter. The Biological Society has organized another committee to conduct research and discussion. Only those who teach in the field can obtain the points that should be noted. In the future, they can publish their experiences in curriculum materials and equipment, and improve the entire science teaching to remedy the current deficiencies.

The Biological Society is constrained by funding, and the society newsletter is being worked on with all efforts. We hope that this newly formed academic organization will grow from Shanghai to the whole country. Colleagues who study biology must be willing to know this news. In the current unstable situation of science in China, we should all contribute our strength to promote the scientificization of our country, both vertically and horizontally, and need to promote it. The Shanghai Biological Society is a seed with vitality, germinating, perhaps this lovely seedling will thrive, with luxuriant branches and leaves. We all have earnest hope!

### Solid Water

— Yepu

Ice is familiar to everyone, but few people know about "solid water." Some people may think this is ice, but it is definitely not. Although it has the same cold and hard properties as ice, the two are completely different because ice is crystalline and solid water is not crystalline. This new substance was invented in 1940 by Dr. B.J. Luyet of St. Louis University in the United States.

The manufacturing of solid water is not difficult. The main tools are a toy gun for children and two metal condensers. Because inside this gun, there are mechanisms such as springs and plungers; when the trigger is pulled, ordinary water is shot out from it, lying flat between two brass discs. These two brass discs are prepared in advance and their temperature has been lowered with liquid air. The water shot into it is suddenly subjected to this severe cooling, and before it can freeze into ice crystals, it condenses into a glass-like film attached to the brass discs. This is solid water.

Solid water is rare. To prove the difference between it and ice, Dr. Luyet specially took a piece, placed it on extremely cold glass, put it in front of a microscope, and combined it with a cross polarized optical Valves; with the help of Polarized—light, he told us that except for what was placed there was crystalline, absolutely no light could pass through. Behind this microscope, a camera was connected, relying on the image taken by the photographs, proved that all was darkness, not exposed to light. This is indeed non-crystalline solid water. Then, this piece of solid water slowly absorbed the surrounding heat, began to melt, gradually producing crystals, and transforming into ice, so the photograph was exposed to light and gradually became brighter. Finally, it still melted into liquid water.

### Professor Einstein

— Wang Qiande

Professor Albert Einstein, the founder of the theory of relativity, was exiled to the United States when Hitler was in power in Germany due to his Jewish heritage. He taught at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University and later became an American citizen. During the war, he participated in the research of the atomic bomb. After the war, based on his scholar's position, he advocated the publication of the secrets of the atomic bomb and did not approve of control measures, but this was not approved by many American colleagues. Recently, he declared that if atomic energy is not used to benefit mankind, he will stop researching atomic energy. (Or)

### The Art of Prolonging Life

— Wang

The pioneer of longevity work was Bogomolets. The method he adopted at that time was to use a special serum to prevent the pains of old age. Although this method cannot be said to be ineffective, it is at least not a specific medicine for longevity; and the method used is only to extend human life by the principle of a certain long thing, so his creation has diminished quietly and has not been widely adopted.

Now, Soviet medical doctor Surikov at the Moscow First Raw Material Institute's biological laboratory has restarted his research, and as a result he has discovered, or it can be said he has achieved, that he can use a method to isolate the "pigment of old age," which can extend the days of old age, that is, extend human life.

But what is the "pigment of old age"? Surikov only gave a simple explanation: "It is a pure substance that is not easy to find in the bodies of children and young people, and it is even impossible to find it at all."

At the same time, the director of the laboratory, Dr. N.A. Ilyin, also discovered a new method. He announced in the February issue of "Soviet Women" that a powdery substance extracted from the cerebral matter has considerable efficacy in prolonging life. This substance is called "Substance of old age."

Where is this "substance of old age" found? It is found in living cells. Due to the discovery and application of this substance, the extension of life has become more secure.

Although the extension of life has considerable certainty, protecting one's own body is still the most important thing. You cannot smoke, because smoking is extremely harmful to your body. Excessive smoking will cost you your life. You should have proper time for work and rest. Too much work and too much rest will also damage your body, and you should also do more physical exercises; so-called physical exercises, such as playing ball and doing morning exercises; these things especially women should pay more attention to, because diseases are much more damaging to women than to men.

Finally, by citing Buffon Furance Rule, it is known that human life can be extended to six or seven times as long as the youth development cycle. In other words, it can be extended to one hundred and seventy-five years, because the human youth development cycle is from twenty to twenty-five years.

### How Machines Plant Rice and Mill Rice

Our country, which has always produced and consumed rice, has actually asked the American people, who have always eaten wheat, for rice because of frequent war disasters! According to statistics, in 1947, the rice shipped from the United States to East Asia exceeded 1.2 billion pounds.

More than half of the world's population eats rice, and most of them are Easterners. However, the United States has now become the world's second-largest rice producer due to mechanical farming and planting. Although our country is still the largest rice producer, there are 16 million people suffering from famine in Hunan and Guangxi provinces alone.

In 1946, the United States produced a total of 2.1 billion pounds of rice, two-thirds of which was surplus. Rice is not native to the United States, so why are Americans so good at growing it? How do they grow it?

Farmers in California use airplanes to sow rice seeds on the water surface, and then harvest it using the Combinedrie—rmethod, so they have become the world's number one in machine-planted rice. They use tractors to pull a row of nail-toothed harrows as wide as 30 feet to lay out the seedbeds. Compared to the primitive harrows pulled by cattle in the East, it is of course incomparable.

More important is the problem of irrigation. In the East, cattle, horses, or manpower are used to draw water into the fields; but in California, farmers only need the convenience of turning on a tap. When the irrigation tap is turned on, the water rolls down magnificently. At the same time, for the removal of weeds and unwanted plants, in the East, there is no other way than to manually pull them out step by step, but in California, farmers only remove the water from the farmland shortly before harvest, and otherwise it is permanently immersed in water. Therefore, weeds have no way to grow, and there is no need to remove weeds. This method was invented twenty years ago by Mr. Jones, an expert from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, because rice seeds can germinate and take root in the soil in the water, and stretch their first leaf out of the water; but weeds cannot stretch out of the water, so they die.

### Psychology of Errors

— Huang Baoduan

The psychology of errors has research value, and it is also very interesting. Knowing some theories will be somewhat beneficial to your future career.

First, ask yourself if you have made any of the following kinds of mistakes, or similar jokes:

(A) You clearly put two umbrellas outside, but you are looking for them everywhere indoors. You clearly put things in place A, but you look for them for a long time in place B.

(B) You clearly know that your friend is "Zhang San", but you mistakenly call him "Li Si". Sometimes, you can't even call out the name of an old friend or colleague who you see every day, but after some time you can naturally remember it again.

(C) You sometimes confuse the words "Li" and "Li", "Duan" and "Rui", "Bady" and "Baby" or "Quiet" and "Quite"... etc. You misread or miswrite them.

(D) The sound of a car is mistaken for the sound of an airplane. (This situation was common during the Sino-Japanese War)

I believe that many people have made similar mistakes (or errors). It seems that these small errors are not worth paying attention to. In fact, these small errors, whether directly or indirectly, will affect a person's career and life. This kind of situation (many and also very complicated). In psychology, they are all called "errors".

We divide these errors into: (1) slips of the tongue, (2) misprints, (3) visual errors, (4) auditory errors, and (5) forgetting and misplacing.

(1) Slips of the tongue—for example: you clearly know the name of this colleague or classmate, but when you call him, you call out the name of another person, you should have said "A": but you say "B"... etc. Saying words that are different from your intentions belongs to this category.

(2) Misprints—this situation is very common, you can often see it in other people's and your own letters or articles. Once I saw on a relative's letter: "Deceased father..." This sentence surprised me very much, because he was a high school student. Later, I learned that he usually hated "nuns" and "matchmakers" etc. He thought that the word "姑" was an inauspicious word, but he explained that he clearly wrote the word "姑", so how could it become "故"... Like (C) etc. all belong to this category.

(3) Visual errors—for example, recognizing the wrong person during the day, or misreading things, etc. all belong to this category. Visual errors often cause reading errors, but reading errors are not necessarily caused by visual errors such as (A).

(4) Auditory errors—this cannot refer to errors caused by similar sounds, it should refer to errors caused by two different sounds where someone uses B instead of A. For example: soldiers in the army mistake the sound of cicadas for the sound of whistles. Before the War of Resistance was over, an old man in my neighborhood was scared to death by the sound of a ten-wheeled truck. These similar situations are the result of auditory errors.

(5) Forgetting and misplacing—your scissors were just in your hand not long ago, and suddenly they are gone, but after a while you find them unintentionally, this is also the result of forgetting and misplacing. Everyone knows the story of a certain inventor who actually put a watch in a pot to boil it as an egg. Such as (A) (B) etc. all belong to this category.

So; why do the above situations occur?

Here we must first know that we all have the ability of intention (meaning), but intention sometimes appears in the conscious world or is hidden in the subconscious world. Its activity is displayed by consciousness, or by various intentions with "emotional molecules", special combinations, these special combinations of intentions are called "Complexes" or "Uncomscious", complexes and consciousness are incompatible, and often conflict, but are often suppressed by consciousness, and cannot directly appear in the conscious world; therefore, these complexes are often forgotten. For example: someone hates something or has done something in the past that he now considers shameful, so whenever he thinks of this thing, he feels uneasy or ashamed. In this way, someone's memory of this thing has become a complex, and this "complex" is not tolerated by the entire personality, because the complex has Dynamogenic, so it often conflicts with the personality (consciousness), if the power of the latter is greater than the former—the complex is often suppressed—that is, someone "suppresses" this hateful or shameful complex to avoid conflict, so that it cannot invade the conscious realm, in order to obtain psychological peace, and often results in "forgetting", creating phenomena of category (5).

However, the amount of "energy" possessed by the "complex" is proportional to the intensity of the emotional molecules. Therefore, when the large amount of emotional content attached to this complex is suppressed, it decomposes and separates from the associations with other facts in mental life. Therefore, this "energy" is not easy to vent, but is always seeking a venting opportunity, or changing form to be presented to the conscious world in the direction of the least resistance; or waiting until sufficient "energy" accumulates beyond the resistance (suppression force), then an Explosion or attack occurs. Once this energy is freed, it also appears in the conscious world. Therefore; when awake, there will be jokes, errors (such as (1)-(5), especially (1) and (2) are the most common), madness... etc.; in sleep, it is displayed in dreams (as mentioned in my previous article "Dreams" in issue 25 of this journal).

So when someone forgets or miscalls your name, then you have to pay special attention, if you also miscall someone else's name or miswrite someone's address, it will also cause the other party's resentment...

Although the above are all simple examples, the purpose is to give readers a simple concept, so that readers can gain some understanding or know the main cause of these "errors"; and reduce a little loss caused by "errors". (End).

### A Gentleman Respects Himself

— Pingzhai

The current situation has reached today, and it cannot be said that it is not serious. Under such a serious situation, the convening of the constitutional National Assembly is even more significant. However, since the opening of the National Assembly, the behavior shown by some representatives has really made us ordinary people feel extremely heartbroken and unable to cry—first, it created a world of "boo!" in the venue, and even the owner of the Ling Xiaohan Pavilion had the wonderful saying of "creating a new record of booing"; then there were representatives who wanted to hit the chairman of the meeting. According to the Nanjing telegram in this newspaper on the 23rd: "Chairman Hu (Jingan) of the Congress... originally intended to defend himself, but seeing that the situation was not good, he struggled out of the encirclement and escaped to the small door in the rear right corner. Dozens of representatives from Yunnan Shun'ning, including Zhang Tingxun, who was the county magistrate of Dali County, and Li Hongru, the labor union representative who was originally a signatory for concession and only managed to attend after running around, took the lead in roaring and chasing, making a mess on the stage. Several journalists asked Zhang for his name, but Zhang refused to answer, instead secretly hiding his badge with his name and number in his pocket, and continued to pursue Hu. The reporters insisted on seeing the badge, and during the dispute, his badge was torn off. Only then did they know that it was Zhang Tingxun. At that time, Hu had already hidden away in the meantime. Zhang then shifted his target and glared at the reporters, almost wanting to use force..."

And on the 24th, the newspaper published the news that "Guangdong representatives and Guangdong overseas Chinese representatives actually smashed the Nanjing Salvation Daily, and several people were injured!" The National Assembly, which the government spends billions of dollars on every day, has left these stains that will stink for ten thousand years, and foreign reporters have sent out special dispatches, spreading it as an international joke—National Assembly representatives should represent the people of the whole country. Today, we ordinary people really feel a little surprised by these tricks, because we have always thought that even if these representatives cannot all be polite, at least there will not be those "glaring" thugs—the representatives are still full of spirit, but we ordinary people feel ashamed for them!

Logically, the reason why the democratic system is worth praising is mainly because it can enable the minority to have an opportunity to express their opinions. The American founding father Jefferson once said to a political enemy: "I firmly oppose your opinion; but I will fight desperately—to give you the opportunity to speak." The mission of constitutionalism is not light. Every representative should know that this is a big step for China to embark on the path of democracy, and the "boo" in the National Assembly fundamentally shattered the word "democracy"! As for the "heroes" Zhang Tingxun and Li Hongru, who "roared and chased" the chairman, their arrogance and inferiority are not worth my ink, but what I want to ask is: Is it difficult to find other representatives who are deeply aware of righteousness in the National Assembly—why did they allow one or two black sheep to create such an unforgivable act without restraint? Why did the righteous and stern rebuke of several journalists in the assembly hall make these thugs who "attacked" the chairman of the National Assembly submissive, while the representatives themselves witnessed this ugly scene, but just stood by and did not say a word? Are you "conniving at evil" or "colluding with filth"?

The recent smashing of the Salvation Daily is even more absurd and lawless! If you become a National Assembly representative, can you just arbitrarily beat people and arbitrarily break the law in the capital? A National Assembly representative who commits violence and beats people is an offender in the act, and the judicial authorities should immediately arrest them and punish them severely. In addition to their criminal responsibilities for injury, they should also be charged with the crime of gathering crowds to disrupt the order of the rear during the suppression of the rebellion, in order to slightly correct international perception and slightly extend national justice! I do not know Gong Debai personally, and I have always disagreed with many of the Salvation Daily's statements, but since the Constitution grants people freedom of speech, then those representatives who are responsible for implementing the Constitution should respect Gong Debai's freedom to speak freely. If Gong Debai's remarks contain slander or other violations of the law, the parties concerned can justly sue in court and demand that Gong Debai be punished for the crimes he deserves. Why, with the status of a dignified National Assembly representative, dare they not openly and honestly resort to the law, but insist on taking the means of thugs? Of course, these people are willing to stoop to this, so we have nothing to say, but we have to appeal to the majority of representatives who abide by the law: Gentlemen, you should know to respect yourselves. You cannot allow these few black sheep to continue to tarnish the reputation of all the representatives. If there is still a little bit of the shadow of the people who elected you that day in your minds today, you should take action to distinguish between right and wrong. Otherwise, it is difficult to prevent the long-standing criticism of the people, and the pens of Chinese and foreign historians will not easily forgive people!

### Also Speaking of Marriage Education

— Yi Jun

Regarding the matter of Shanghai College planning to add a course on marriage next semester, many have already discussed it, and everyone's opinions are uniformly in agreement, so there's originally no need to discuss it again. However, the author is an unmarried young man, about to graduate from university, already reaching the advanced age of "twenty-five this year, clothes torn with no one to mend," deeply fearing that the fate of "if you want someone to mend, wait another twenty-five" will befall me, which would truly be terrible! As it's a personal issue, not minding the wordiness, I'll also talk about it.

First, let me honestly tell you (actually, you already know): During ordinary leisure time after class, male students gathered together most enjoy talking about, first, women, second, women, and third, still women. I think the female students' leisure activities or work naturally involve talking about men and discussing husbands.

Suppressing the tendency to pay attention to the opposite sex is originally a strong human instinct, as important as hunger for food and thirst for drink. As far as school students are concerned, they probably become aware of the difference between men and women in the upper grades of elementary school, begin to admire each other in junior high school, reach the intensity of dry wood meeting fire in senior high school, and in university, they can go through fire and water for their lovers, unafraid of death. Pursuits can be crazy, and heartbreak can lead to suicide, which is extremely grand! Therefore, is the meaning of marriage merely about continuing the family line? This is an extremely important part of life. Not getting married means lacking an extremely wonderful program in life, which is an incomplete life.

Old-fashioned marriages relied solely on parents' orders and matchmakers' words, resulting in rigid matches with no room for choice. If it turned out well, it was luck; if it turned out poorly, it was deserved. Fortunately, that era is almost over.

However, what are the results of new-style marriages? While many marriages are happy, there are also many that result in tragedy. Some lovers are unable to become spouses, and many who marry cannot grow old together, leading to marriage and divorce, separation and reunion, with marital disputes constantly occurring and family tragedies frequently playing out. These are all problems that urgently need to be resolved. Expanding further, those who wish to govern their country must first regulate their family. If husband and wife are not in harmony, how can the family be regulated? Therefore, this is a major issue related to individual fortune and misfortune, as well as the rise and fall of the nation. Listing it as a course in universities, designating it as a subject to guide young men and women on how to pursue suitable partners, establish happy families, and avoid life's tragedies, and to enjoy sweet love, is truly extremely necessary! It can be asserted that students will definitely eagerly enroll and that their exam scores will be above eighty points.

### Gasperi

— Dao Xian

Italian Prime Minister Gasperi was imprisoned twice by Mussolini before the war for leading the Christian Democratic Party. Later, he fled to the Vatican, working as a librarian with a monthly salary of eighty yuan. To supplement his income, he taught foreign languages and ghostwrote communications for foreign journalists.

During the war, he and his friends secretly returned to Italy, organizing guerrilla forces to resist the Nazis. In the 1946 election, much to his surprise, the Christian Democratic Party won eight million votes, becoming the largest party in Italy. Gasperi won again in this election, but he was much more nervous.

Gasperi lived a simple and plain life, residing in a small apartment. The furniture was the same set he had bought on installment when he was a librarian at the Vatican. He slept on a small hardwood bed. The only decorations on the white walls were a crucifix and an image of the Virgin Mary.

At the beginning of his term as Prime Minister, his first action was to draw an advance on his salary to buy a new blue suit. Gasperi was extremely frugal, often turning off unnecessary lights. His wife was a farm girl who bore him four daughters, one of whom married a butcher in Milan, and another became a nun.

Gasperi most admired experts. Surrounding him were many talented individuals who helped him counter the Italian Communist Party. Some say that Gasperi's greatest achievement in Europe today is that he governs the country without the "help" of the Communist Party.

### Ma Yongzhai

— Qian Dacheng

Those who visit Yu Mountain in Changshu all know about Wang Si's Wine Shop, and also all know about Ma Yongzhai. Ma Yongzhai is a cooked meat shop. It has branches in both Shanghai and Suzhou, so it is especially famous far and wide. The owner of this shop is named Ma, and it was founded in the Qing Dynasty. His family used to live in Guli Village in the eastern countryside, and they were moderately wealthy, owning several acres of land. The people of Changshu have always placed great importance on their appetite, and his family was especially so, eventually losing all their wealth due to excessive eating. However, their culinary skills were thereby refined even further. When driven by hunger and cold, they placed their delicacies in a bamboo food basket (showing that he was also a scholar) and peddled them in teahouses and taverns (many impoverished households in Suzhou are doing this now). People tasted his food and greatly enjoyed it, calling his braised pork "Ma's Pork" and his braised chicken "Ma's Chicken," and only that made by his own hands could satisfy their appetite. His chicken floss and stewed chicken were especially his masterpieces (and there was also grass carp floss with an extremely exquisite taste, but it no longer exists now). What is called stewing involves first setting up a pot, placing several catties of vegetable oil and soy sauce in it, along with fennel and other fuels (the fuels and medicinal materials have a fixed formula). The oil is cooked until it is heated, and then a cooked chicken is placed in the pot overnight. The taste is extremely delicious, and the color is also yellow and tender. Pork, chicken, duck, eggs, dried tofu, etc., can also be placed in it. The older the pot, the better. The "Commentary to the Book of Han" suggests that 煼羊炙肉, sheep roasted with hot stone, is what we today know as stewing, is actually a speculative term, not worth believing. In a few years, the Ma family revived their family business, and then established Ma Yongzhai in front of the Xianri Temple. The storefront is extremely narrow and has remained unchanged for decades. However, his business is thriving. Locals give him local products as gifts when they go out, and outsiders who want to taste the famous products of Yu Mountain flock to this shop. Although other families tried their best to imitate him, with shops facing each other, and Long Yongzhai and Feng Yongzhai rising up one after another to compete with him, they ultimately could not match him. Every year, the number of chickens and ducks killed often reached tens of thousands. However, its taste is ultimately the most exquisite in the Changshu main store; the Suzhou and Shanghai branches inevitably cater to the tastes of the people there, losing their original authenticity. However, his family knew the taste of food, rose again after a setback, and actually became a wealthy family. He was indeed a hero of commerce!

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

Confidence, love, and perseverance are the air, sunlight, and water of the tree of thought.

Beautiful peach blossoms, picked and placed in a vase for appreciation, adorn the spring in a warm room. In a few days, they wither and fade... even the most beautiful life comes to an end.

Unattractive flowers, unnoticed and unappreciated, turn into peaches on the tree.

"One day in heaven, a thousand years on earth." - This is the official listed price of the "time market." Life on earth is getting harder and harder. Now, I don't know how many billions of years it would take to exchange for one morning and evening in heaven?

Time is so precious, an hour is longer than a day, a day is longer than a year, and a year is longer than a lifetime...

We can clean up a decades-old, uninhabited house until it's spotless, but who can wipe away the dust in our memories? Even if that memory is from last night's dream, even if that dust is only a tiny speck.

### Talking About Inkstones

— Ban Meng

Many people have talked about inkstones since ancient times. Li Zhiyan has "Inkstone Catalogue," Mi Nan Gong has "Inkstone History," Cao Jishan has "Inkstone Treatise," and in the late Qing Dynasty, Shi Yushan had "Gleanings from Inkstone Forest," and Ji Shouqiao had "Study of Duanxi Inkstone Pits." There are many inkstone treatises, too numerous to mention. While Duan inkstones are certainly excellent, there are also good ones from She inkstones, so one should not be rigid in one's assessment.

Duan inkstones began in the Wude era of the Tang Dynasty. By the Five Dynasties and early Song Dynasty, the southern and northern walls of the lower cliffs of Duanxi were discovered, with the northern part immersed in spring water and the southern part half-immersed. The northern stone was more moist and glossy, slightly better than the southern one. From the Zhiping era to the Xuanhe era, more and more stones were taken, and the walls were all hollowed out into caves, resulting in the differences between the upper, middle, and lower cliffs, and the divisions between the east, main, and west caves. During the Yuan Dynasty, they were closed off. During the Yongle and Xuande eras of the Ming Dynasty, they were opened and closed irregularly. In the late Chongzhen era, Xiong Wencan reopened a pit, and the stones obtained surpassed the Song Dynasty pits. In the late Qing Dynasty, all pits were unrestrictedly exploited, and even more stones were taken, but good stones were extremely rare. Those that have been passed down through generations and are famous are all old items, mostly regarded as superior if they can grind ink well and release ink well.

Those who collect inkstones distinguish the quality of the stone's color and luster based on its place of origin. The Longyan General Pit, the Lower Cliff Old Pit, the Water Cliff Old Pit, etc., all have good stones. During the Yongle era, the stones from the West Cave of the Water Cliff were considered fine, smooth, and good for grinding ink, so those who took them were unscrupulous, and the cave was hollowed out. Water Cliff stones do not have a purplish-red color like pig liver. The purple color has a faint white and light green hue. The purple color is dark in the center and light on the outside, either round like a coin or scattered in patches, commonly called "fire markings." The faint white parts are like smoke and clouds, without a fixed shape, commonly called "banana white." There are also patterns like green flowers and yellow dragons. In general, a good stone should be smooth, clear, and moist, and feel good to the touch, able to be distinguished in the dark.

Regarding inkstone eyes, it is especially necessary to distinguish between dead and alive eyes. If the eyes are not alive, they will be mixed with impurities and lack luster. Live eyes are black and white, bright and moist, with eight or nine layers of halos, clearly resembling pupils, and it is especially interesting if they seem to flow like water in the space between the eyebrow and forehead of the dragon on the inkstone. If the stones from Plum Blossom Pit, with bean-shaped eyes all over, are also not easy to obtain. Although the stone is from Duan, a new one is not good. Carving it into elaborate and symbolic shapes such as dragons, tigers, wind, clouds, three platforms, single pillar, figures, and landscapes is vulgar and lacks elegance, and it does not match the beauty of the stone's quality. Collectors especially do not take them.

As for the green flowers, if the dots are cluttered and mixed, they are not high-quality. Only those that float and sink on the surface of the stone, appearing and disappearing sparsely, and when viewed closely, resemble hair strands, mouse tracks, or fly wings, interspersed with delicate patterns, or resemble fine algae floating in streams, or resemble schools of fish swimming in water, or resemble dense autumn clouds, or resemble fine dust on the water surface, are all considered to be top-grade. There are many different types of stone patterns, such as fire markings, gold coins, iron markings, phoenix saliva, jadeite, king's belt, yellow dragon, gold threads, partridge spots, cinnabar spots, and ancient spots. It is difficult to distinguish them, and only those who are knowledgeable in this field can analyze them clearly.

Good inkstones are not limited to Duanxi. The Song Dynasty brush silk and luo-pattern inkstones are made of Shezhou jujube core pit stones, with different colors and beautiful workmanship, and were also praised in ancient times. My friend Chu Jianweng once collected a large round inkstone of Mr. Dongpo, about two feet in diameter, engraved with many handwritten works of Dongpo. The stone was not from Duanxi, but seemed to be from She. After the bandit rebellion, I don't know if it still exists. For us inkstone users, the ability to grind ink is the most important thing. What the surface pattern is like is a matter for inkstone collectors and can be ignored. As for inscriptions by famous people and carvings by skilled craftsmen, although extremely exquisite, they have nothing to do with those who cultivate inkstone fields. Recently, the owner of Ling Xiaohan Pavilion obtained an ancient inkstone, with powerful calligraphy on the side inscriptions, but it is not known what era it is from, and it is still under investigation.

### Distant Sacrifice to Deceased Parents

— Shi Shufan

In life, suffering, never known joy,
In death, still difficult to find earth's rest,
Old eyes, at the end, son not there to see,
Thick frost, drifting on the coffin, bones long cold;
Two weeks' time, swallowed sobs remembered,
One mournful cry in the dark, supporting dreams to see,
Mother and child's bond, what lifetime to continue?
Paper ashes burned in the sea, the sea should run dry.

Wandering flesh and blood, begging for compassion,
Thin hemp clothes, not yet able to wear,
Since sharing tears with the orphaned crow, ending the year,
Expected no Laba porridge to offer before the spirit,
The closing of the coffin seals thoughts of a son's tears,
Riding the moon, one should ascend the tomb-sweeping boat,
Heartrending, this heart beating inside the drum,
Gazing afar, what year will bring a homecoming sacrifice?

Bearing a son like me, death's eyes won't close,
Funeral palace, not yet swept, still floating duckweed,
Three years without a mother, still doubting it's a dream,
One offering of incense, can there be a spirit!
Butchering dogs, can I forget that day's oath?
Holding ice, how to wash away the homeland's stench?
Renting a knife to buy a horse, poverty hard to remedy,
How dare I say returning banners marked on the grave.

Son's strength, though exhausted, blood still red,
Son's heart, extremely bitter, for insignificant loyalty,
Originally knowing not burying is a crime against heaven,
Already driven to selling writing, carving bone poor!
Sons and brothers calling three times, finally recognizing me,
River washing ten thousand folds, must return east,
Before spring, sacrificing and telling of the winter's snow,
First donning hemp clothes, bowing in the snow. A Youth

### Socrates' Little House

— A Youth

The great Greek philosopher Socrates once built a small house, which everyone found very strange. His neighbor asked him:

"Master, your name is known throughout the world, why build a small house like a pigeon coop to live in?"

Socrates said: "There may be no particular reason. But although this house is small, if I can fill it with good friends, I will be very happy."

— Friends all over the world, how many are truly close?

### Talking About Cocktail Parties

— Ji Mo

The American cocktail party was originally a small chat among friends before dinner, but now it has become an indispensable ritual for promoting a new movie star or selling a certain cosmetic or a new model of car.

Among the millions of residents of New York, perhaps only a few thousand regularly attend cocktail parties, and among these few thousand, some attend one or two parties every day, including columnists, beauty and fashion magazine editors, and journalists.

Relatively important cocktail parties in New York City all have a specific purpose, such as introducing a movie star who has come to New York, introducing a new film being released, introducing newly made fashions, and publishing a new book. The scale of these cocktail parties varies, from borrowing a small room in a hotel with fifty or sixty attendees to renting a large and luxurious dance floor with perhaps hundreds of attendees.

The circumstances of cocktail parties are roughly similar. Three or five people gather to talk, lowering their voices to show their politeness. When eating, they also take small bites and stop, unlike those who eat as much as they can in restaurants.

Cocktail parties also have several rules. One of them is to avoid talking to the honored guests who are invited as much as possible. Some people who regularly attend cocktail parties have never spoken to those honored guests for many years.

Literary cocktail parties are highly valued. The gentlemen and ladies attending hold teacups, chat and laugh, and witty remarks are made frequently. Attendees include publishers, writers, and the usual guests found at cocktail parties. They sip cocktails and exchange mundane matters of daily life.

Nowadays, almost every business leader in America has discovered that hosting cocktail parties is an excellent way to connect and promote themselves to the outside world. There are all kinds of parties that introduce kitchen equipment, electric refrigerators, or jewelry. As for parties that introduce fashion and beauty products, they are held every day. Industrial designers also display sculpted products at cocktail parties, accompanied by music and explanations from experts, elaborating on the product's characteristics and advantages.

The expenses of cocktail parties often deter many people. In most cases, the hotel room is provided free of charge, and the host only needs to pay for the alcohol and food. As for the Waldorf Hotel, which holds about twenty cocktail parties every week, and the Stork and St. Regis Hotels, which have two or three cocktail "parties" every day, their prices depend on the host's desire to be extravagant and the amount consumed by the guests.

Cocktails cost between 55 and 88 cents per glass. Sandwiches and snacks cost between one and one and a half dollars per serving. For five dollars, you can eat turkey, ham, or other hot dishes placed in a mobile glass cabinet.

On average, each guest has to spend three dollars or more to hold a cocktail party. Not long ago, a certain person from California booked a banquet at the Waldorf Hotel, insisting that famous singers such as so-and-so sing, costing a total of three thousand dollars. He also ordered various flowers, costing two thousand dollars. He set up two types of bars at the cocktail party: a champagne bar and a mixed drink bar. Expensive caviar was also served to the honored guests. This time, he entertained one hundred and three friends, costing a total of ten thousand dollars. Ordinary cocktail parties, however, cost about a thousand dollars.

In short, cocktail time is an interesting interlude between office hours and meal times, quite similar to English tea time. It is a product of genuine American social customs. Some say that it adapts to the needs of American industry and commerce and arises in response to the times; however, some also say that it is a type of "time-wasting disease" suffered by Americans.
