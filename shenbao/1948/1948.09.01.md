### 中紡股票月中發行　七成充金圓券保証準備　十分之三委託國行代售　票面一百圓分有記名無記名兩種

[Report from our Nanjing office on the 31st] In order to replenish issuance reserves and increase national treasury revenue, the government has decided to convert state-owned enterprises into marketable securities by issuing stocks. Part of these stocks will be allocated to supplement issuance reserves, while another part will be formally sold. Relevant departments of various state-owned enterprises are now beginning to prepare separately for matters related to stock issuance. Regarding the methods for issuing stocks of the China Textile Industries Corporation (中紡公司), Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian convened a meeting on the afternoon of the 31st, gathering Director of the Department of Commerce Deng Hanliang, Director of the Control Department Fei Mingyang, and other relevant directors to discuss the matter. The complete methods were decided on the evening of the 31st. According to the decision made in these methods, after the China Textile Industries Corporation completes its alteration registration, it will be transformed into a marketable security, issuing six million shares with a face value of one hundred gold yuan per share. Active preparations are currently underway with the aim of starting the issuance within five days from the 10th to the 15th of the month. Excluding the allocation of seventy percent to serve as a guarantee reserve for the issuance of gold yuan notes, and the transfer of stocks to the Issuance Supervision Committee, the remaining thirty percent will be sold publicly on the market. The sale will be handled by entrusting various national banks to act as agents. The stocks will be divided into two types: registered and unregistered. There will be no restrictions on the public purchasing the securities. The stocks will be issued in full value. Although the face value of the stocks is one hundred gold yuan, the selling price will be above one hundred gold yuan. This is because when the China Textile Industries Corporation was valued in the past, only the machinery and real estate were included in the estimate. Finished products, raw materials, and other assets were not taken into account. At that time, the estimated assets of the China Textile Industries Corporation were over 145 million US dollars, which is far from the actual value. Therefore, the selling price will be higher than the original estimate. The public will still be happy to purchase them. These stocks can be listed on the market around the 15th. However, it is not necessary to wait for the securities exchange to resume operations; the stocks can be sold directly through the various national banks. The methods for issuing stocks of other state-owned enterprises are also currently being drafted by the relevant supervisory authorities.

[Report from our Nanjing office on the 31st] Since the promulgation and implementation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, initial achievements have already been seen in reality. An authoritative figure familiar with the political situation stated to reporters on the 31st that the reform of the economy must rigorously implement austerity and conservation. Since the promulgation of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures, the government has successively announced various laws and regulations, with concrete and detailed steps for increasing tax revenue and controlling commodity prices. This not only demonstrates its determination for economic reform but also shows the government's efficiency in handling affairs, which is a fundamental condition for the success of this reform and deserves our praise. However, there are also unavoidable omissions, namely, that there is still insufficient attention to austerity and conservation. The original Emergency Measures contained important provisions regarding the reduction of waste in state-owned enterprises and the regulations on the salaries of civil and military officials. Their impact on the success or failure of this economic reform is no less than that of increasing tax revenue and controlling commodity prices. However, the government has not yet issued concrete and detailed regulations for the above measures, which makes people suspicious. We should not neglect the example of the British, who used passive measures to overcome their economic difficulties. The current number of civil and military officials and the enormous amount of funds the national treasury bears each month for their upkeep show that austerity measures are urgently needed. The authoritative figure then continued to offer his opinions on austerity measures, stating that the reorganization of state-owned enterprises should begin with the reduction of redundant personnel. Although layoffs may face certain difficulties in practice, the government must have the determination and must separate unemployment relief from national personnel recruitment. Then layoffs can be successful. In addition to this, saving on various materials is also of paramount importance. We should still follow the austerity measures of the Anti-Japanese War period as a lesson for today. Then the goals of the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures can be fully achieved.

The meeting was chaired by Committee Member Zhang Jingyu, and Director Jiang Shuge of the National Tax Administration was invited to attend. The initial draft prepared jointly by the National Tax Administration and the committee's specialists was discussed. However, since the monetary reform and the issuance of gold yuan notes, many articles in the draft Provisional Property Tax Law needed to be revised, and the draft implementation regulations also needed to be revised accordingly. As a result, it was decided to appoint five committee members – Zhang Jingyu, Cui Jingbo, Lu Yuwen, Liu Zhendong, and Jin Shaoxian – to organize various opinions and reconvene a five-person subcommittee meeting on the morning of the 2nd to revise the initial draft before submitting it to the committee's review meeting for discussion.

### 蓉鎳幣貪汚案　各方咸主嚴辦

[Report from our Chengdu office on the 31st] The Chengdu newspapers on the 31st all published evidence and facts of the corruption and fraud involving nickel coins at the Chengdu branch of the Central Bank. The Sichuan Provincial Assembly and the Chengdu Municipal Assembly have jointly sent a telegram to the central government requesting a thorough investigation. Sichuan legislators Xu Zhongqi and others have jointly telegraphed President Chiang and Premier Weng, requesting that a high-ranking official be sent to conduct a thorough investigation. It is generally believed that this is the first corruption case in the country since the implementation of the new economic policies, and all parties advocate for strict handling.

[Report from our Shenyang office on the 31st] The Northeast Suppression Headquarters Political Committee, due to the special circumstances in the Northeast, submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval of a larger new staffing plan than originally stipulated, while currently shrinking the existing staff.

### 調整軍人恤金

聯勤總部擬定方案

[Report from our Nanjing office on the 31st] An official in charge of the Pensions Department of the Combined Service Headquarters stated that, following the currency reform, the various pensions for military personnel should be calculated in gold yuan and adjusted accordingly. Plans for the army and navy have been drafted and submitted for approval and implementation. It has also been decided that all annual pensions for this year that have not yet been issued will be signed and issued only after the adjustment plan has been approved. This is because annual disability pensions for the army and navy are issued once a year, and according to regulations, if adjustments are made during the year, those already issued will not be supplemented. Therefore, the above suspension of signing and issuance is actually a measure to protect the interests of pension recipients.

It was resolved that: (1) The Ministry of Finance should consult with the Ministry of Communications and entrust all postal branches across the country to assist local public and private banks in quickly exchanging large amounts of legal tender, aiming to exchange more than half of the prescribed amount within one month, and to widely distribute subsidiary coins. (2) The Ministry of Finance should pay attention to ensuring that banks exchanging gold yuan notes do not reduce the fineness of gold bars stamped with goldsmiths' marks when exchanging gold bars, and prevent the occurrence of a black market for silver dollars. (3) The Ministry of Finance should strictly order executors to thoroughly implement laws and regulations.

### 對七五事件願負全責　傅作義自請懲處　電長二千餘言情詞懇切

[Report from our Beiping office on the 31st] Fu Zuoyi telegraphed President Chiang and Premier Weng on the 30th, requesting punishment for himself regarding the responsibility for the July 5th Incident. This news was published on the first page of yesterday's newspaper. The original telegram was over two thousand words long and stated in brief: "Having read the investigation report of the Control Yuan, clarifying the incident and the personnel who should be punished, it is noticeable that Zuoyi is not among them. In order to fully demonstrate the government's consistent care for young students, I respectfully follow the well-known instruction that 'punishment should start from the top.' I am willing to fully bear all responsibility for the incident and request severe punishment to appease the situation."

[Report from the Central News Agency, Beiping, on the 31st] Fu Zuoyi telegraphed President Chiang and Premier Weng, stating his views on handling the "July 5th" incident and listing the following four reasons to request punishment for himself:

Sympathy for Students

(1) The young people from the Northeast have experienced extreme hardship. This time, after enduring dangers and traveling to Beiping, they should, in both reason and sentiment, receive the deep care of the government and the greatest sympathy of society. However, due to the impact of the war and material difficulties, although many efforts have been made, they have not been given timely and appropriate resettlement. Regardless of how unruly the students' actions were, the occurrence of the July 5th incident, in which eight students died, nineteen were injured, and one merchant died, is an undeniable fact. In addition to my grief, I am willing to bear the responsibility myself, and with my own sacrifice, I express the government's utmost concern for young people, so that the dead may rest in peace and the living may receive some comfort. And young students, after this painful lesson, should know that the conspiracies and provocations under the slogan of sympathy and instigation actually contain the sinister and poisonous goals of those who are

Using others as tools and recognizing the schemes of conspirators

raising vigilance. Sacrificing Zuoyi alone can call back countless young people to be loyal to the country and loyal to the government.

Respecting the Assembly

(2) At the beginning of the implementation of democratic constitutionalism, the Assembly is a legitimate organ of public opinion, leading the people, assisting the government, and its position is extremely lofty, and its responsibilities are even greater. All citizens should respect its powers and responsibilities, and the government should either be responsible for receiving it or provide it for reference depending on the actual situation of any resolution. This time, the resolution of the Municipal Assembly on the resettlement of students from the Northeast in Beiping, regardless of whether its wording was inappropriate or not, and not having been delivered to the government, unexpectedly suffered violent destruction. This is not only a major damage to democratic constitutionalism but also creates a bad precedent for the loss of legal protection by national assemblies. I am eager to maintain constitutionalism and regret that I was unable to prevent it beforehand. Considering the responsibility, and weighing the facts, I have failed in my duty.

Caring for the Police and Gendarmerie

(3) During the July 5th student parade, the police and gendarmerie were ordered to maintain order. I strictly ordered that all those approaching the students must be unarmed, and officers of all levels of the police and gendarmerie also repeatedly warned that no bloodshed was allowed, and no one issued an order to fire; from morning to dusk, the police and gendarmerie personnel always maintained public order while enduring hunger and thirst, without hitting back when hit, or verbally abusing. Although the students' actions were激越, fortunately, no accidents occurred; it was reported that after the announcement of martial law at 7:00 PM, a conflict unfortunately occurred between the students and the military police. According to the situation at the time, it is contested as to where the first shot came from. The students claimed that they were about to get up and leave, while the military police claimed that the students got up and the shooting occurred at the same time, mistakenly believing that the students were starting to seize guns, and in emergency and fear, this unfortunately caused the bloodshed. More than 20 police officers maintaining order were also injured. Local public security agencies have the solemn responsibility of protecting the lives and property of the people. After the declaration of martial law, they have the power to maintain public order and suppress riots. The police and gendarmerie personnel endured hunger and thirst, suffered insults, and were then subjected to bloodshed and injuries. One cannot but say that they endured humiliation and maintained their position, and their situation is worthy of sympathy. The responsibility for the July 5th incident cannot be placed on them. Order requires them to maintain it, but the responsibility is shirked onto them. Punishing the subordinates instead of the superiors will lead to a situation where no one will maintain public order in the future, and the impact on the lives and property of the people will be unimaginable. In order to break the past bad habit in officialdom of taking credit for oneself and blaming others, and to avoid the trap of the Chinese Communist bandits of disarming the city's police and gendarmerie, I am willing to bear the responsibility for the incident.

Righteousness and Vigorousness

(4) After the unfortunate occurrence of the July 5th incident, the elders of the Northeast, due to their deep concern for their children, could not help but become agitated in their speech. People from all sides have also paid great attention to the aftermath. Their motives are pure and deeply admirable. After all, the young people of the Northeast are the young people of the Republic of China, and having come to Beiping, they are treated as the young people of Beiping. Caring and concern are shared by all, not just the elders of the Northeast. The people of the Northeast have endured the suffering of wandering since the September 18th Incident, and cannot return home after the victory because the lost territory has not been recovered. They are emotionally depressed and easily agitated. However, this is a call for righteousness and vigorousness and should be cherished and encouraged to inspire loyalty and bravery in suppressing bandits and saving the people. Zuoyi values this precious sentiment and is willing to bear the full punishment for the incident.

Willing to Accept Severe Punishment

The telegram concluded, "This incident cannot be dealt with from a legal point of view according to martial law, but must be punished from an emotional point of view" to quell the disturbance. Now, if the government does not blame me, but allows others to bear all the resentment, then the government's consistent policy of protecting students, especially Your Excellency's virtue of caring for young people, may be misunderstood." It also stated, "Since Your Excellency has authorized me with full power over North China, I should be responsible for the entire responsibility of the incident, which is reasonable and proper. Even when the students in the July 9th parade shouted the slogan 'Shoot Fu Zuoyi,' I was calm and did not mind at all. Although the circumstances of the incident are extremely complicated, since it has unfortunately occurred, I should bear the unfortunate consequences myself, and accept Your Excellency's most severe punishment with a very pleasant mood."

Editorial

### A Brief Discussion of the Press on Journalists' Day

Today is our own holiday as journalists. Once a year, we recall the past, confront the present, and look to the future. It is indeed the best opportunity for us to conduct self-examination. As we celebrate this special day, we must not only strengthen our belief that "China must progress, and our press must progress first," but also engage in self-reflection, self-encouragement, and diligent effort to fulfill our responsibilities to the nation and society.

The development of the press in our country, like other endeavors, can be divided into three stages, with the War of Resistance Against Japan serving as a watershed. From the founding of the Republic of China to the eve of the War of Resistance Against Japan was the first stage for the press in our country. The press aspired to follow the path of Britain and the United States. All journalists in the country yearned for the ideals of British and American-style liberalism, striving for freedom of speech and seeking speed in news reporting. However, in essence, the press in our country at that time was still different from the press in Britain and the United States. The newspapers in Britain and the United States all operated on a large scale, while the newspapers in our country, although also trending towards commercialization, were still private institutions for scholars to discuss politics. With the exception of a few major newspapers in Shanghai, newspapers in other regions all used discourse as a means to attract readers. However, after the September 18th Incident, as the nation faced increasing difficulties, the press in our country began to undergo fundamental changes. Whether it was private newspapers or party-run newspapers, they all shared a common intention. Although the opinions of various newspapers sometimes differed, they had a common and consistent understanding of the belief that "the nation is supreme and the country is supreme." The purpose of any discussion was always to eliminate national crises and secure the freedom and survival of the nation. Therefore, before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the press in our country made very significant contributions to the completion of domestic peace and unification.

The press in our country entered the second stage with the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, newspapers across the country stepped forward and completely dedicated their publications to the nation, allowing it to use them. As a result, the press transformed from institutions for scholars to discuss politics into powerful tools for promoting national policies. At the same time, journalists across the country gained a further understanding that the fate of the press was inseparable from the fate of the nation, and that they could not survive without the nation. Even newspapers that had previously strived for freedom of speech became public propaganda organs that largely accepted government guidance. They not only wholeheartedly welcomed government censorship of news, but also strictly adhered to wartime news policies in both speech and news reporting, and rigorously implemented the program for resisting Japan and building the nation. Therefore, during the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, we journalists made unparalleled contributions to the victory of the war. We not only earned the deep trust and respect of the people of our country, but also gained international recognition. Thinking about it today, we still regard it as an unparalleled honor for us journalists.

However, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the press in our country not only failed to develop and grow, taking it to the next level, but instead faced two major crises, causing the press to become dim and colorless. The first is the external crisis. Because domestic warfare had not ended, with flames of war raging everywhere, social unrest, economic hardship, transportation blockages, and business stagnation resulted. The press in our country was the first to suffer a major blow. The recent decline in circulation and limited reach of various newspapers is simply unprecedented in the past fifteen years. Some newspapers have even been forced to cease publication due to poor material conditions and inability to sustain operations. As the press became depressed, journalists were naturally the first to bear the brunt. Because of the meager salaries, they were not only unable to work in peace or pursue continuing education in their spare time, but the majority of journalists were also struggling on the brink of unemployment and starvation. The request by colleagues in Hankou to be paid at the same rate as public school teachers and civil servants shows how envious they are of public school teachers and civil servants, which is a perfect example. The second is the internal crisis. Because we journalists, stimulated by international trends, are undoubtedly infatuated with "freedom of the press," while at the same time often neglecting "the responsibility of the press." Therefore, in the recording of news or the expression of opinions, we only seek the pleasure of personal will, regardless of the interests of the public. As a result, the records of speech inevitably deviated from the norm, and some journalists, acting as they pleased, even abandoned the position of the nation and the people. Over the past three years, disputes in the press have emerged one after another. While this may be due to various unexpected reasons, the fact that some of our journalists lacked a sense of responsibility to the press may not have been an internal crisis. Looking to the future, if we journalists still fail to take warning about the responsibility of newspapers, then in the future, the press in our country may not be able to fully undertake the important mission of promoting social reform and advancing national construction.

In short, the dual crises facing the press in our country are not only sufficient to hinder the development of the press in our country, but also a stumbling block in the path of national construction, which should not be ignored by the nation and the public. In addition to hoping that the government will find ways to salvage the crisis facing the press across the country, we also hope that our colleagues will be able to encourage themselves and strive to improve the press. However, for the press to progress, journalism education must progress first. Therefore, as we celebrate Journalists' Day today, we sincerely hope that the education authorities will pay special attention to the training of talented journalists and the continuing education and research of current journalists, and we first express our unconditional support for the initiative of more than ten journalists in Shanghai today to establish a "Shanghai News Museum."

### Four-Power Commanders in Germany Hold Meeting to Discuss Unifying Berlin Currency Based on Co-Management Principles to Draft Plan Moscow Negotiations to Continue During Meeting

[United Press Association, Berlin, 31st] The US Information Center announced on the afternoon of the 31st, Berlin time: The military governors of the four powers, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, stationed in Germany will hold a meeting in the Allied Control Council at 5 pm, which is the first official affirmative statement. It is reported that the four governors will meet in the name of a "special committee" rather than the Allied Control Council.

[France News Agency, London, 31st] Diplomatic sources here: The four-power occupying forces commanders meeting held in Berlin today will last for a week. It is also said that a new meeting between the three-power representatives and Molotov will not be convened before the four-power Berlin meeting submits a report to their respective governments.

[United Press Association, London, 31st] A British Foreign Office spokesperson stated on the 31st: The current stage of the Moscow four-power talks has come to an end. The four-power military governors stationed in Germany will hold a meeting in Berlin, possibly this afternoon of the 31st. It is also said that the Moscow meeting will be suspended until the four governors have completed negotiations on the Berlin currency system. He said, "Preparations are underway in Berlin to prepare the technical aspects of the four-power commanders in Germany to discuss the problems between the Western countries and the Soviet Union. After the Berlin meeting is over, the governments concerned will receive a report and the talks in Moscow can be resumed." From this statement, it can be seen that the Moscow consultations have reached a decision on the Berlin currency system after a month, but there is no sign of lifting the blockade. It still remains for the four commanders to agree on the use of a unified currency in Berlin. Although it is a small matter, the four commanders' meeting will be the first step in restoring the four-power co-management of Berlin (which may later be extended to Germany). The agenda includes only the currency system issue. It is speculated that the four commanders have been ordered to implement the decisions reached in Moscow in principle. Sources with access to information said that the timetable for resolving the Berlin crisis seems to be: (1) The Moscow agreement instructed the four military governors stationed in Berlin to instruct the currency policy. This move was completed on the evening of the 30th, advocating the circulation of East German marks under four-power co-management. Second, the four governors discussed the actual steps of the new plan, including difficult issues such as the exchange rate between the East and West Mark zones. Third, the four governments approved the decisions and steps of the four governors.

[United Press Association, Berlin, 31st] The military governors of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union stationed in Germany are scheduled to meet in Berlin on the 31st to discuss the implementation of the resolutions of the Moscow four-power talks. US Military Governor Clay told the United Press Association that the four governors' meeting has been decided to be held on the 31st, but the location and date for the restoration of the Allied Control Council for Germany have not yet been determined. According to authoritative sources, the four governors' meeting is to discuss the reform of the Berlin currency system. Since the collapse of the Allied Control Council on March 20, it is the first time that the four governors have gathered together. It is also the first time in weeks that the four governors have been in Berlin at the same time. French Commander-in-Chief Koenig arrived here on the evening of the 29th. His political advisor Seydou, who participated in the talks in Moscow, is expected to return to Berlin today. Clay and British Governor Robertson were still at the Frankfurt meeting on the 30th and rushed back to Berlin on the same day. It is reported that Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky is currently at the Potsdam headquarters outside Berlin. British and American senior financial advisors were ordered to stay here, and another group of advisors is already on their way to Berlin.

### Berlin City Government Asks for Neutral Zone Rejected by Soviet Military Commander Demonstrations Continue, City Council Unable to Reconvene

[United Press Association, Berlin, 31st] It was generally hoped that the Berlin City Council could resume its meetings without having to move to the Western occupied zone. On the 31st, it was shattered by a letter from the Soviet representative to the Berlin City Council, Sur. Sur asked that the area around the City Council be designated as a neutral zone to avoid disturbances by communist demonstrators and to suspend the meeting, but it was severely rejected by Soviet Commander Kotikov.

[France News Agency, Paris, 30th] Since Human agreed to organize a new cabinet, there is great optimism about resolving the political crisis. It is believed that Human can get the support of a majority of 311 votes in the National Assembly. It is generally believed that if necessary, Human can concurrently serve as the Minister of Finance in the new cabinet. Political circles here also believe that the fatal blow to the previous Human cabinet (provincial elections) has now been eliminated, because the National Assembly has passed the postponement of this election, and the approval of the Senate seems to be no problem.

The Socialist Party issued a statement tonight, criticizing Leno's proposed economic plan, which cannot save the financial crisis and cannot meet the stability of workers and society, so it will inevitably lead to a cabinet crisis. Finally, the Socialist Party's statement expressed dissatisfaction with the recent newspaper campaign against the Socialist Party, pointing out that it should be responsible for the government's instability.

[United Press Association, Paris, 30th] Human announced tonight that he will organize a middle-of-the-road cabinet. When Human discussed policies with moderate leaders, the Communists launched workers' parades and demonstrations, advocating for a general election.

After Human left the Presidential Palace, he told reporters, "I believe that the time is pressing and the people can no longer wait. After consulting with the leaders of various parties today, I feel that I still have the possibility of obtaining a majority of votes. Although the organization is difficult, I believe it will be successful."

### Albania Interferes in Greek Civil War UK, US, and France Will Protest US Blames Greek Officers for Dereliction of Duty

[France News Agency, London, 30th] The British Foreign Office officially confirmed tonight that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are discussing possible measures to take against Albania. For months, Albania has been accused of harboring guerrillas fighting against the Greek government forces and assisting General Markos on the battlefield. The three countries may jointly lodge a strong protest with Albania. The recent offensive by the Greek government forces against the guerrillas does not seem to have had much success due to the assistance of the Albanian side. The protests of the three countries may appease the morale of the Greek government forces. On the other hand, it is believed here that some reports from Athens pointing out that the Greek government forces may be forced to invade Albania are exaggerated. The current conflict between the Cominform and Tito has formed a new situation in the Balkans. The invasion of another country by the Greek army will undoubtedly cause an absolutely serious situation.

[France News Agency, Athens, 30th] A spokesperson for the Greek Army General Staff commented on the criticism made by Frett, the director of the US Military Mission to Greece, at a press conference, that the commanders of the Greek battlefield in the Grammos Mountains condoned more than 5,000 guerrillas to escape into Albania, saying that the press conference was confidential in nature and that Frett's words were misunderstood in many ways.

### Allied Headquarters Officials Hint to the Japanese to Organize an Anti-Communist Committee; the Japanese Communist Party is Planning an Anti-Occupation Movement

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 31st] Dr. Williams, a senior official in the Allied Headquarters' Political Affairs Section, told the press today: Japan's establishment of a Committee to Investigate Subversive Government Activities, similar to the US House Un-American Activities Committee, would likely receive Allied Headquarters approval. He also stated that the establishment of such a committee is currently under consideration. If the Japanese side requests it, the committee may be established. The purpose of establishing this committee is clearly to prevent communists and those with communist ideas from holding public office.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 31st] According to Japanese Communist Party leaders Sanzō Nosaka and Yoshio Shiga, who told Central News Agency reporters: The party will soon announce its peace treaty objectives, including demands for the complete withdrawal of all occupying forces and the independence of Japanese politics and economy. The Japanese Communist Party's announcement of peace conference objectives at this time clearly aims to introduce the Cold War into Japan.

For the past two months, the Communist Party has been engaging in anti-occupation work under the guise of a "national independence" movement, with considerable success, and has won the support of some non-communist elements.

### Implementing Effective Measures to Contract Currency: 200,000 Tons of Materials to Be Sold Off Starting Today; All Kinds Total Tens of Thousands; Mostly Daily Necessities; Retail Stores Open with Low Prices

[Our Newspaper] In order to cooperate with the government's national policy of contracting currency and stabilizing the currency value, the Central Bank, in conjunction with the Materials Supply Bureau, will begin a large-scale sell-off of materials today. Currently, the Central Bank controls over 200,000 tons of materials, valued at 40 million US dollars, mostly daily necessities. There are two ways to sell them: one is a nationwide auction, and the other is large-scale retail sales. The Materials Supply Bureau has rented the ground floor of the Seven Heavens (Yong An Company's new building) as a retail store, classifying and displaying daily necessities. The quality is excellent, and the prices are also lower than the market. Director Li Lixia of the Central Bank said after guiding reporters on a tour: Selling off a large amount of surplus materials will greatly help to contract currency and stabilize prices. The surplus materials are US military supplies. The items sent to the front lines for soldiers during the Great War were all top-quality goods. After seeing the displayed goods today, everyone will know that the surplus materials are by no means the scrap metal that is rumored to be. The quality of all the goods is superior. The selling prices are decided by the Evaluation Committee and are all lower than the market prices. The retail store is scheduled to open for business today, and it is expected that those who come to buy will be crowded.

The reporters, accompanied by Deputy Director Chen Shuzeng, Director Li Lixia, Secretary Zhao Chenguan, etc., visited the 15th warehouse of the Materials Supply Bureau. This warehouse was formerly the site of the Mitsubishi Corporation's warehouse. It has four floors, filled with surplus materials that have been sorted out, totaling more than 120 tons, with about 20,000 kinds, including paper, cloth, paint, photographs, calculators, food, ice cream powder, women's cosmetics, etc., everything is available. Relevant personnel said: In the past, due to evaluation problems, the sell-off was delayed. In the future, a large-scale supply will be made to the market through auctions and retail sales. Due to the large quantity, it will change the prices in the city and even the whole country.

### Fuxing Island Warehouse Occupies 800 Acres

After visiting the 15th warehouse, we visited the Fuxing Island warehouse of the Materials Supply Bureau, which ranks third in scale. The site covers 800 acres and is divided into seven areas. There are many trucks, transportation equipment, and heavy equipment. In addition to some that have been allocated to the Ministry of National Defense, there are many surplus materials that can be used for civilian purposes. According to Yang YunSong, the group leader of the Materials Supply Bureau who accompanied the tour, told reporters: "The value of the materials shipped from the US Pacific islands is over 300 million US dollars, but when the US transferred and transported them, they were not classified and were mixed together, so sorting them out was particularly time-consuming. The materials displayed in the warehouse after cleaning are of good quality and can be used, and they are of high value. For example, a bundle of thick rope used on the wharf costs no less than a bar of gold. Other items such as car tires and cloth are sold at very high prices on the market." At that time, when our country received the surplus materials, the Central Bank and the Materials Supply Bureau separately received them according to the islands in the Pacific. Most of the materials from Guam and other regions in the Mariana Islands were received by the Central Bank, and most of the materials from the Marshall Islands and other places were handled by the Materials Supply Bureau. When stored, they were all stored in the Materials Supply Bureau's warehouses. There are more than ten warehouses in this city, and the Baoshan warehouse is the largest. The Fuxing Island warehouse, which occupies 800 acres, ranks only third in terms of scale.

### Contractor Absconds with Housing Funds, Seven Guarantors Shirk Responsibility in a Chain, District Attorney's Office Files Public Prosecution

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Executive Yuan's Material Supply Bureau previously put out a tender on Fuxing Island for the construction of lead-roofed houses. A construction contractor, Shen Shiqing, won the bid with the lowest price. At the time, Shen was required to provide guarantees from Yu Zhisheng, Li Linchang, and Chen Dingliang, which the Material Supply Bureau verified as valid. Consequently, they paid Shen half of the total contract amount, 18.7 billion legal tender. Unexpectedly, Shen absconded with the funds. The Supply Bureau, noting the delayed construction, pursued the three guarantors. However, the second guarantor also went into hiding, and both successively engaged lawyers to publish disclaimers and withdrawals of guarantee. The Bureau, suspecting that Shen and others were colluding to defraud the contract funds, immediately filed a complaint with the District Attorney's Office. Yu Zhisheng failed to appear in court. Chen Dingliang testified that he was entrusted by Li Linchang, who in turn claimed it was a favor to his friend Dong Zhiyun. Dong claimed that he did not know Shen Shiqing at all but was only entrusted by Zhang Damin, who claimed he was entrusted by his clansman Zhang Jinfang. Subsequently, the court attempted to summon Zhang Jinfang, only to find that he had also fled. The prosecutor in charge, believing that the defendants were mutually shirking responsibility and were all in the same boat, jointly filed a public prosecution against the seven defendants for fraud, and those who had fled were placed on the wanted list to be brought to justice for questioning.

### University Student Accused of Breaking off Engagement, Judge Persuades, Both Parties Attempt Reconciliation

[Report from Our Newspaper] The case of Feng Ji, a Daxia University student, being accused of breaking off his engagement was heard again yesterday by Judge Mei Erhe of the District Court. The defendant, Feng Ji, and the plaintiffs, Peng Zhixing and Peng Chuqiao, all appeared in court. Feng Ji provided detailed testimony regarding his acquaintance with Peng Chuqiao, their engagement, and their cohabitation in Shanghai, after which he discovered that Peng was no longer a virgin. He stated that Peng had previously engaged in ambiguous behavior with her brother-in-law and that whether Peng's pregnancy was his child needed to be determined after a blood test of the infant. If confirmed, he would then proceed with the wedding. Peng Chuqiao, in her testimony, vehemently denied writing a letter of repentance and engaging in unchaste behavior. She also claimed that her brother-in-law had never come to Shanghai, and even if he had, it would not prove that he had a relationship with her. At this point, the court urged both parties to attempt reconciliation out of court, repeatedly guiding them to consider the reputation and future of both parties and the happiness of the next generation, advising them not to let their love end in hate. The audience in attendance was moved. The case could have been concluded and a verdict announced in court, but the court, considering that both parties were young university students, granted a two-day extension to attempt reconciliation out of court to avoid legal entanglement. The case is scheduled to be concluded tomorrow.

### Drug Case Cracked on Train, Two Suspects Arrested, Remainder at Large

On August 13th, the Jinghu Railway Police Department discovered a male passenger on Train No. 6 from Shanghai to Beijing on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway carrying a large package of acidic, yellowish-brown material, identified as narcotics. He was arrested. After being taken off the train at Suzhou Station, the material was tested and found to be heroin, weighing 6.5 kilograms, with an estimated value of 41,100 Gold Yuan. The suspect was escorted back to Shanghai on the same day. The suspect was extremely cunning and, apart from providing the name Zhu Yuansheng, claimed ignorance of everything else. After several days of exhaustive interrogation, he finally revealed the truth on the 17th, stating that the narcotics were entrusted to him by a woman named Chen Lüshi from Haizhou to be delivered to Gao Guiying at No. 10 Yijiabang outside Suzhou Jianmen and to a Mr. Zhang at No. 22 Caoqiaotou behind Suzhou Park. Officers were dispatched to arrest them, but both had already fled. Only Gao Zhu was apprehended. Zhu Yuansheng also confessed that Chen Lüshi would trade the narcotics at the Quanyuan Teahouse in the Maris Small Vegetable Market in Shanghai and that Chen Lüshi cohabitated with the owner of the Dashan Hotel on Tianyao Road on the fourth floor of the hotel. Both principal offenders have now fled upon hearing the news. In addition to continuing to intensify the pursuit, the Police Department will transfer the two arrested suspects to the District Attorney's Office today for legal proceedings.

### Investigating from a New Angle: The Coal Capital of Jiaozuo, the State of Traffic Suffocation Immediately Restricts Coal Production

—Special Correspondent for Our Newspaper, Ling Songshou

[Dispatch from Jiaozuo, Our Newspaper, 24th] Jiaozuo, this coal capital of the Central Plains, has lost its past glory under the shadow of war. There is no coal for cooking, firewood is sold for 50,000 yuan per catty, which calculates to 100 million per ton of firewood. Large lumps of coal from Xinxiang sell for 2.1 yuan a piece, but Mr. Li Tazhai, commissioner at the Xinxiang Office of the Central News Agency Company, said that large lumps of coal from Jiaozuo only cost 18 million yuan a piece, which was a recent adjustment. Before the adjustment, broken coal cost 1.2 million yuan per ton, enough to buy a pack of cigarettes. Jiaozuo is hidden in the mist. The reporter is determined to go take a look.

The reporter arrived in Jiaozuo, where entry inspection is strict. It is difficult to find an open store on the streets. There are many small vendors, but later it was learned that many of them are "side businesses" of mine employees. Electric lights, which have become rare in Henan Province, shine in the Jiaozuo city area, but they cannot dispel the thick clouds and miserable fog surrounding Jiaozuo.

Central China Coal Mining Company

Originally had two mining areas, one in Lihe, which was destroyed in the early days of the War of Resistance. Currently, the mining area being mined includes the Wangfeng and Lifeng mines. The total area of the mining area is approximately 5,000 tons, and the estimated coal reserves are approximately 2.754 billion tons. From the second year of the Republic to the twentieth year (1913-1931), a total of 22,841,161 tons of coal were produced, ranking third in the country in terms of coal production.

The geology of the Jiaozuo mining area (referring to Lifeng and Wangfeng mines below) belongs to the Carboniferous period. The mining area was originally mountainous, but crustal changes resulted in the collapse of the Jiaozuo mining area. To this day, traces of faults can still be found north of Lifeng. The geological structure of the mining area is roughly Carboniferous and Permian above (including the Taiyuan Series and the Shanxi Series, i.e., the lower Permian and the middle Permian). Below is the Ordovician limestone. Between the two layers is the main coal seam, with an average thickness of about 5.78 meters. The coal seam runs northeast-southwest, sloping at 10 to 25 degrees. It extends approximately 1,600 feet northeast and approximately 5,000 feet southwest with Wangfeng as the center.

In terms of coal quality, it is the best anthracite. Jiaozuo's "Yuhe lump coal" has long been famous in China. Seventeen years ago, Mr. Shen Yijia, who represented China at the International Fuel Conference, compared Jiaozuo coal with more than 1,000 kinds of coal samples collected by the Halconomi Company in Belgium. According to his and the company's person in charge’s judgment, the coal quality of Jiaozuo coal far exceeds that of the best anthracite in the United Kingdom, and its color and luster are as good as graphite.

The reporter, on the day of arriving in Jiaozuo, was accompanied by Director Li Fazong to visit the mining area.

Lifeng and Wangfeng

The engineering and equipment of the two major mines are similar. After briefly viewing Lifeng, the reporter went to Wangfeng, where the mine is located, for detailed observation.

Wangfeng has a 350 K.W. generator, which, together with a 750 K.W. generator in Jiaozuo, is the source of power for the Jiaozuo coal mine. These two machines are operated alternately every week, and the rest time is also the repair time, because they were produced in 1912 and are too old! The upper part of the Wangfeng power plant uses iron plates as a substitute for the ceiling. This is wartime equipment for protection against artillery shells.

Wangfeng has two mine entrances. Currently, because the production is low, only one is used. The lifting of coal cars is controlled by a winch, which is powered by a 160-horsepower and a 30-horsepower motor. In terms of ventilation, a steam-powered ventilator is responsible for sending air into the well. The drainage equipment in the well is an electric pump, powered by a 400-horsepower motor.

### Cheng Intercepts Ship Supplying Communists, Materials and Criminals All Detained

[Dispatch from Jiangyin, Our Newspaper, 29th] The Criminal Police Team of the Police Department seized a Sun Changsheng Jiang ship supplying the Communists at the Xibei Wai Zha West River on the 26th. The ship was loaded with 39 bundles of raw-edged paper (6.5 reams per bundle) for making ten-line paper, more than 3 tons of scrap iron, and five boxes of movie film, weighing 800 pounds. Three criminals, Geng Zhensheng, Chen Derong, and Liu Futang, were captured and sent to the County Military Law Office for interrogation on the 28th. Chen Derong is from Jingjiang, residing at No. 5 Xinsheng Lane, Changan Road, Shanghai, and currently works as an umbrella nailer at the Southeast Umbrella Factory, No. 14, Lane 456, Xinzha Road. The materials belong to Fan Chengren, who is from Changzhou and was originally a bookkeeper at the Xiexing Candle Paper Store near the Xinzha Bridge in Shanghai. He resigned during the Dragon Boat Festival this year and is now at large. All materials have been confiscated and detained by the county government. Chen and the others have been detained in prison to await further investigation.

### Changsha Central Bank Staff Assault Reporter, Mayor and Bureau Chief Rush to Mediate, Decision to Punish the Assailant, Apologize, and Compensate

[Dispatch from Changsha, Our Newspaper, 31st] Regarding the Changsha Central Bank's assault on a reporter, more than 40 reporters went to the residence of the bank's manager, Xin Xinruo, to question him that night. Mayor Jiang Kunzhu and Provincial Police Bureau Chief Li Jun rushed to mediate upon hearing the news. Xin admitted at the time that he would immediately dismiss the assailant and send him to court. However, the reporters demanded that the punishment should also include the bank's deputy manager, Chen Zhongfan. Xin could not immediately agree to this, and Mayor Jiang persuaded him. On the 31st, the bank invited six representatives from the reporters to the Central Bank, where the bank would offer a satisfactory apology and compensation.

[Another Dispatch] Fu Zidi and Zhu Yeqiao, reporters from the Hunan Construction and Liang Bao newspapers in Changsha, went to the Central Bank for interviews at 2:00 PM on the 30th and were refused, resulting in a conflict. It is reported that bank staff kicked them from upstairs to downstairs, and Zhu was beaten by more than a dozen police officers, causing injuries to both. They were detained for more than 20 minutes before being released. Fu and Zhu have gone to the court for medical examination and have accused the bank of assault and restricting personal freedom. The Changsha press is deeply shocked by this incident and has issued a notice to convene an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures.

### Autumn News from Hangzhou

—Special Correspondent Chuyu Sheng

Play for a while, the Gold Yuan Note has just been issued, prices are still stable, and the average person can enjoy the first stable prices after the victory with the famous West Lake.

Market Dynamics

Speaking of the Gold Yuan Note, in the four or five days after Hangzhou received the news, some speculators were eager to make a move. Rice, vegetables, pork, and cloth all experienced drastic price increases without any basis in the "August 19th" price reduction. Later, public opinion in Hangzhou unanimously called for the government to deploy a large number of police to arrest the illegal merchants one by one. Since then, department store prices have fallen straight back to the original prices of August 19th. The factors that cause price increases, in addition to insufficient materials and currency inflation, include

[Our Hangzhou dispatch of the 29th] Several days of autumn rain have gradually driven the summer vacationers from Mogan Mountain and Guling down the mountain, and Hangzhou is once again showing its golden age. Groups of tourists, unseen for three months, have once again arrived on the shores of West Lake. Experienced people in Hangzhou say: This year's "autumn tiger" will be short, the autumn flood season can be extended, and the Haining tide will be particularly large. Going to see the tide and back can be done entirely in Hangzhou. Outside of this there are also social factors, especially in China's situation where officials and merchants are indistinguishable, speculators are fearless and desperately raise prices. If the government offices indulge in favoritism, it will foster their arrogance and boldness. If the government offices handle matters impartially, they will naturally know how to restrain themselves.

Advocating for Whom

It is said that some people are advocating for these speculators who were arrested in Hangzhou. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce specially hosted a press conference for this matter, and their reasons were: (1) There are many types of goods. Except for daily necessities, there is no agreed price. Because the cost of goods is different, the selling price may vary. (2) Various industries had a public agreement to adjust prices before August 19th, and notifying the industry after the 19th would be considered a self-raising of prices. (3) After the 39th, if the purchase price from the place of origin increases or there are other special reasons, and it is necessary to adjust the price, the guild should make adjustments based on the cost. (4) The Chamber of Commerce notified all industries to sell at the gold yuan price converted at the August 19th legal tender price before August 31st. (5) The government's price control laws and regulations must be strictly observed, but merchants have a lower level of knowledge, and the initial implementation should start with education orders. If the special criminal court does not ask about the severity of the circumstances and handles the cases uniformly, then merchants will feel insecure, unable to operate, and seeking to stabilize prices, but causing panic in the commercial market, which is not the government's original intention of stabilizing finance, and should be given administrative punishments by the government to show consideration.

The speculators arrested in Hangzhou, in addition to the Chairman of the Commercial Guild, Jiang Guangyin, sending them to the Special Criminal Court, the rest were bailed out by powerful figures. The Hangzhou public opinion circles are deeply concerned. They sincerely fear how long this good phenomenon of swift and vigorous action can be maintained? Can the arrested people certainly be brought to justice?

Special Relief Donation

Hangzhou's special relief donation should also end in the fall. Overall, it is a joy for everyone, without being distributed to wealthy families, but fully recognized by various trade associations. It is said that there are still about 10 billion that have not been settled. A certain influential committee member once said: "You don't have to donate. Anyway, I will donate at most 500 million." But according to insiders: "He didn't even donate 500 million?"

In the past few days, many stores in the Zhongzheng Street area have automatically posted signs saying "Supporting President Chiang's Restoration of the Original August 19th Price, Big Sale, 10% off." In general, public educators are beaming with joy and have gone to buy some things. They are all saying on their lips that the government's use of power this time is effective, and their hearts seem to be unusually happy. Merchants with such kindness are worthy of praise.

Sighing at Learning

Autumn has arrived, and the newspapers and schools in Hangzhou are about to start school. Every school is crowded with people registering. A small elementary school that is relatively famous only enrolls ten first-grade students, but 129 people went to take the exam. The municipal middle school only enrolls 100 students, but more than 2,000 people took the exam. Not to mention the universities. Two private schools have particularly expensive fees. Going to kindergarten at these schools costs two dan and five dou of rice per semester. The municipal education authorities also have a headache about this, but they say that because of the facilities, teachers, and other factors, it has to be this way. Under such circumstances, we can imagine how many people are sighing at the school gates and how many people are losing the freedom to seek knowledge.

However, the golden age of Hangzhou does not seem to have been lost. You see the boats on the lake are shaking their spirits to welcome customers. The stores selling local products are also working hard to paint their facades, and the vendors in the scenic areas are all smiling to greet the grand autumn season this year.

Manjuelong will once again be fragrant with osmanthus flowers. In Hupao, Shiwu Cave, and Yanxia Cave near Manjuelong, a wave of people will surge again. Is Hangzhou really a place to "play"? In fact, there are still many people living in this environment, and they, like other places, are thinking about how to make their lives better.

### Wholesale and Retail Prices of Cigarettes Set Yesterday by the Social Affairs Bureau; Cigarette Factories Must Not Refuse to Distribute Goods on Pretext of Helping to Inspect

[Our Dispatch] Since the implementation of currency reform and emergency economic measures, cigarette factories of all sizes in this city have suspended the distribution of goods due to unresolved issues regarding price limits and tax increases, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand in the cigarette market. Regarding the issue of price limits, the Social Affairs Bureau has approved it yesterday. Those who had no factory prices on August 19th may refer to the market prices of "August 19th" to set new factory prices, but they must not exceed the market price on that day.

The Social Affairs Bureau convened responsible persons from the Cigarette Industry Commercial Guild and the Industrial Guild for a discussion. The two guilds stated three difficulties in the cigarette industry: (1) Because summer is the mold season, cigarette factories routinely distribute fewer goods. There were also no factory prices on August 19, so most distributions were suspended; (2) General single-purchase customers and scalpers used the August 19 price limit to search for and purchase a large amount of goods, causing some firms to hoard goods and refuse to sell; (3) Scalpers resold to vendors at high prices, creating a black market for cigarettes. The Social Affairs Bureau will strive to resolve the difficulties in the industry, but urged all factories to distribute goods in large quantities and not to refuse to distribute goods on pretext of inspecting. The prices should still comply with the price limits of August 19 and should not be exceeded. A table of limited wholesale and retail prices for cigarettes has been set to ensure compliance. The cigarette prices are listed as follows (unit: Gold Yuan 1 yuan):

### Foreign Tea Transactions Few

Yesterday, the foreign firm tea market was quiet. It is reported that due to strict price controls, especially for export goods, exporters were trying to suppress prices for black and green tea. However, sellers continued to report strong production prices, making it difficult to reduce production costs, so negotiations became deadlocked, and the transaction volume decreased, but the market atmosphere remained stable.

It is also learned that if the attitude of importers and exporters can be slightly more accommodating, a large amount of green tea will reportedly be shipped to North Africa first. At the same time, it is planned to promote a considerable amount of Qimen black tea to various parts of the UK. As for domestic sales of various types, the transaction volume is also mediocre, and the situation remains unchanged.

### Sugar Sales Brisk

With the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, sugar sales have turned brisk. Yesterday, Taiwan Sugar Corporation held its usual price quotation and sales of a batch of special grade refined granulated sugar in 200-jin bags. 591 units applied, and the total number of applications reached 62,290 bags (usually the number of applications does not exceed 20,000 bags). To meet the needs, the company did not reduce the applied quantity, but changed the original 200-jin bags to 120-jin bags to ensure widespread supply. The allocation price was set at the lowest quoted price of 28 yuan and 55 cents per dan.

### North and South Markets Diverge; Rice Prices Vary; White Rice Prices Increase the Most in the South Market

Rice prices in the north and south markets diverged. The southern market rose, while the northern market fell slightly. White rice prices increased the most in the southern market. Top-quality white rice was 20 yuan and 5 cents, an increase of more than 1 yuan. Thin rice was 21 yuan and 4 cents, only 1 cent away from the price limit. Early rice was also as high as 20 yuan and 5 cents, and white yuan had reached the price limit of 20 yuan and 66 cents. After the market opened yesterday, prices rose due to brisk sales and trading. The northern market prices were slightly lower by 2 cents. Special high-quality rice was 21 yuan and 8 cents, and new rice was 20 yuan. The total amount of goods arriving in the north and south markets yesterday was 4,231 shi.

Flour

Slightly tighter, old godowns have generally transferred to the hands of spot sales under the push of cargo owners. Yesterday, there were fewer sellers, so it rebounded. Bingshan flour rose from 6 yuan and 9 cents to 7 yuan, and Jiancheng flour jumped out of 7 yuan, with each rising 2 cents to 3 yuan and 15 cents. Only Lao Che flour was lower again by 1 cent and 5 cents, probably because it had not fallen much on the previous day. Miscellaneous brand flour generally rebounded by 2 cents, bran was flat, and the factory price of wheat was still limited to 10 yuan and 3 cents.

Miscellaneous Grains

Still very firm, prices have mostly reached the price limit. However, yellow bean transactions are strong because oil factories are selling very well, so the market is very firm and high-quality goods are difficult to purchase. Corn is still stable because many of the transactions on the previous day were returned. Yuan wheat transactions are relatively rare, with only a slight amount of sales on this street, and prices are also fixed. Green beans with high-quality goods were priced at 17 yuan and 33 cents, with some sales. Broad beans and peas had few transactions. Sesame seeds only had three or five packages for sporadic transactions on this street. Raw peanuts had roughly equal supply and demand, and the market was flat.

Edible Oil

Slightly uneven, raw oil and sesame oil are spot transactions, so the market is still firm. Jilong raw oil is limited in price, so special returns are used to compete for raw oil transactions, priced at 59 yuan and 8 cents. Small cart sesame oil is limited in price. Soybean oil and vegetable oil are lowered by one yuan because of warehouse receipt transactions, limited-term appearances, and rumors of prohibiting warehouse receipt transactions. Soybean oil returned to below 50 yuan, at 49 yuan and 5 cents, and vegetable oil was 45 yuan. Bean cake is quite firm, with each brand cake reaching the limit of 4 yuan and 6 cents.

### First Batch of US Cotton Allocation Set at 69,000 Bales

The US cotton allocation issue that manufacturers have been longing for has been agreed upon by both China and the United States. The quantity of US cotton to be allocated in the first batch is 69,500 bales. The ratio of cotton yarn to cotton exchange is one 20s standard yarn and 599 pounds of cotton (including labor). Before the allocation, an actual survey must be conducted. Only manufacturers whose cotton inventory is less than two months' worth of use can obtain the right to preferential allocation, and the quantity will depend on the actual needs of the factory.

Furthermore, the US Aid China Yarn and Cloth Joint Venture has been established. Representatives from the Central Bank, Liu Gongyun; state-owned representatives, Zhang Sili; private representatives, Rong Yixin; representatives from the US Aid Cooperative Agency, Huai De; and representatives from the US Aid Application Association, Shen Xirui, all attended the meeting. It was decided that starting today, the work of allocating US cotton will be carried out according to the established principles of US cotton distribution, and it was decided to appoint Liu Jianhua as Chief Secretary, Pan Jianlang responsible for distribution, and Song Li responsible for export sales.

[Our Dispatch] The Fortune Steamship Company's Myanmar Yimeili (under Clark Feit) arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, transporting 5,325 pieces of cotton from Calcutta and Bombay, India, and 4,500 pieces of cotton from Hong Kong, as well as 750 pieces of rubber and 1,395 bundles of wood. It is now docked at Jianyuan Wharf for unloading.

### Many Chips, Nervous Sentiment; Yarn Prices Linger at Price Limits; Cotton Cloth Rises to the Limit and Trading Stops

Due to the end of the month, yarn merchants are mostly closing their accounts, and because the Economic Police control is very strict, closely sealing warehouses. The Textile and Construction Company sold more than 3,000 bales every other day, and yesterday it sold 10s Red Leopard yarn for 478 yuan, 16s Fairy price for 578 yuan, 20s Golden Twin Chicken price for 645 yuan, and Jixiang price for 672 yuan. There were more applicants than before. The market chips are abundant, and people's hearts are failing and trending soft. They are also throwing sales in the market. Only the replication industry, which urgently needs raw materials, is willing to buy a little. 20s Jincheng coarse yarn was sold 10 yuan below the price limit, and other miscellaneous yarns are lingering at the price limit. A total of 67 pieces were traded.

When the cotton cloth market opened in the early morning, because it was autumn and the actual sales in various places were starting, the buyers were swarming, and the asking prices all rose to the limit, and the trading could not be done. The brokers complied with the orders of the authorities and automatically closed the market, and there were no transactions in the market.

Also, the Textile and Construction Company sells cotton cloth at a fixed price allocation. Although the supply is listed as inferior goods, it is extremely popular due to the autumn sales season. It is estimated that the price of 10-pound Yanghe Japanese cloth is 23 yuan and 6 cents per bolt, 4 Gentleman Yuan mercerized cloth is 33 yuan, and second-class bleached cloth is 28 yuan and 2 cents, Wansan bleached cloth is 28 yuan and 5 cents, Leifeng Pagoda Jingyuan fine cloth is 28 yuan and 5 cents, and Jumping Carp Hidden Green Billiard second-class product, Haichang Blue Fine Oblique Print Tribute, etc., and colored floral bedsheets, a total of 14 types. Later, it was heard that someone shouted to buy Yanghe B-character fine cloth for an additional 10 to 20 cents, and the market was very popular.

### Loan-Day Interest Changed to Three Yuan per Thousand

The Silver Money Trust Three Guilds recently resolved that, starting today (1st), the loan-day interest rate will be changed to 3 yuan per thousand. The deposit-day interest rate and the interbank-day interest rate will still be handled according to the notice on August 30th and will not be changed.

### The Cotton Cloth Broker Association, the Second Session

The Cotton Cloth Broker Association, at the third joint meeting of the second session of supervisors and directors, made the following resolutions on assisting the authorities in suppressing market prices and stipulating commission amounts:

(1) The market price must be based on the August 19th price and must not be exceeded, and there must be no further black market transactions. Do not test the law and cause trouble for yourself. If the price of the goods rises to the limit, the transaction should be stopped automatically.

(2) The commission for goods sold by the Textile and Construction Company on the market is temporarily set at a minimum of 2.5 cents per bolt in gold yuan.

### Export Goods Transacted Before the Effective Date Can Be Released by Customs Upon Request

But only for ten days and with sufficient documentation

[Our Dispatch] According to the Transportation Management Committee, after the implementation of price limits on export goods, exporters who completed transactions before the price limit date are requesting the Committee to forward letters to Customs for release. In order to clarify the total quantity sold and conclude old cases, the Committee has specially stipulated that all goods transacted before the price limit date that require the Transportation Management Committee to send a letter to Customs for inspection and release must be submitted to the Committee for verification within ten days after September 1st, along with relevant documents such as a copy of the letter of credit, contract, and correspondence telex certified by the bank. Those who fail to meet the deadline will be handled according to the price limit measures.

### Woolen Fabric Transactions Initiated

Woolen fabric transactions were seen to be initiated yesterday. The merchants in the street and the Western clothing merchants all have needs, and Nanjing and Hangzhou merchants have also come to apply for purchases. Flannel, gabardine, overcoat cloth, flower ocean cloth, sleeve lining silk, feather yarn lining, etc., all have considerable transactions. The reason is that the actual sales of autumn are approaching, the money supply is loose, and the interest rate is reduced. In the midst of the authorities' efforts to suppress prices, the market has remained flat. Those with a little money are all buying materials.

### National Bank Issues a Circular to All Branches and Offices to Strengthen Financial Inspection Work

[Our Dispatch] In order to coordinate the consolidation of finances and strengthen economic control measures, the Central Bank has actively strengthened financial inspection work and has specially stipulated the "Matters to be Observed by Branches in Inspecting Firms and Trusts."

### Professors' Representatives from National Universities in Beijing Request Adjustment of Compensation for Public Educators; Held a Press Conference Yesterday to Publish Three Points

[Our Nanjing dispatch of the 31st] The joint meeting of professors' representatives from national colleges and universities in the capital held a press conference at 3 p.m. on the 31st to discuss the issue of adjusting the compensation for public educators. Representatives from various schools, including He Yijun, Hu Jiajian, and Wang Muzun, explained in detail the opinions on adjusting the compensation for public educators as follows: (1) The adjustment of salaries for public educators across the country this time is mostly unreasonable, and the government should make adjustments again according to pre-war standards. (2) The compensation for public educators across the country should be calculated and paid in gold yuan notes plus, according to the prescribed salary amount; however, at a time when the national treasury is experiencing difficulties, discounts may be given in accordance with the method of paying national crisis salaries in the early stage of the Anti-Japanese War, and the difference may be issued with public bonds or savings certificates. (3) The academic research subsidies for professors at national colleges and universities were originally higher than the public expenses of the fourth-level supervisors of central agencies, but this adjustment is only equal to the public expenses of the seventh level, which is inappropriate; the government should be requested to adjust it to 100 gold yuan.

### Subsidizing Academic Research Expenses: A Slight Expression of Concern; Remarks by Relevant Personnel of the Ministry of Education

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 31st] Regarding the request from specialized schools and above for increased research subsidies, relevant personnel from the Ministry of Education stated: The establishment of academic research subsidies for teachers at national specialized schools and above originated in the mid-period of the War of Resistance. At that time, prices were rising daily, and the government, under financial difficulties, and recognizing the hardship of professors' lives, sought to express a slight degree of concern. The initial amount was very small, and although it had undergone adjustments, it remained of little help. In July of this year, the Ministry drafted a plan to issue subsidies based on living index standards and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for an increase. Later, due to currency reform, a gold yuan standard was proposed and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. However, due to financial difficulties, especially at the beginning of currency reform, it was necessary to prioritize balancing income and expenditure in order to overcome this difficult period. Therefore, the approved amount is the current standard, and this amount is insufficient to support academic research; even as a living allowance, it is very meager. However, compared to before the currency reform, there has been a definite improvement, and it still only slightly expresses the government's concern for scholars.

### New and Returning Students Must Fill Out Guarantee Forms; Parents, Guardians, etc., Should Maintain Close Contact

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 31st] The Ministry of Education has issued an order to all directly affiliated schools and education departments/bureaus in provinces and cities, instructing all schools that all new and returning students must fill out guarantee forms before enrollment this semester. Enrollment registration procedures can only be completed after verification. Parents, guardians, and guarantors should maintain close contact at all times. It is also stated that this matter concerns students' compliance with school rules and the encouragement of moral character and learning and must be earnestly implemented.

### Columbia Teachers College President Cables Congratulations on the Establishment of the Teachers College Alumni Association

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 31st] The China Branch of the Teachers College Alumni Association of Columbia University in the United States plans to hold a general assembly in October of this year. The president of the parent school and more than thirty professors have sent letters of congratulations on the establishment of the China Branch.

It is expected that the governments of all countries sending library scholars here will prepare to publish the materials written by their representatives at the school in their respective countries.

### Reader Scholarship Committee Decides: Shen Bao Scholarship Assistance Approved

Hoping School Presidents Will Carefully Recommend Students, as Scholarship Amount is 50% or more, to Prevent Exploitation

The Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Committee held its second meeting yesterday to discuss scholarship matters for this year and decided on the following: (1) This year's scholarships will focus on junior and senior high school students, with a higher proportion allocated to them than in previous years. (2) Junior high school application forms will be distributed to school principals starting today for students to fill out. Senior high school forms will be issued in three days, and university and vocational school forms will be issued in one week. (3) The number of recipients for this year has been determined to be 150 for junior high school, 100 for senior high school, 30 for universities, and 20 for vocational schools, totaling 300 approved recipients. (4) The scholarship standard for this year will be uniformly set at 50% or more of each level of school tuition. (5) In mid-July, the committee issued "Recipient Grade Summary Forms" to each school, stating in the letter that those who did not submit the form would be considered to have automatically withdrawn and would not be eligible for assistance this year. It has now been found that a small number of junior and senior high schools have not submitted the form. They are required to contact the committee in person within three days, or their application eligibility will be canceled. In addition, a "Recipient Investigation Form" was sent out, and most have already been filled out. Those who have not filled it out will also not be allowed to apply. (6) The allocation of slots to each school this year will be absolutely cautious. It is hoped that all school principals will be impartial and recommend students earnestly. If it is discovered that a student from a relatively well-off family is fraudulently claiming a scholarship, it will be immediately canceled. A method of soliciting secret reports will also be adopted to prevent exploitation and fraudulent claims.

### Ministry of Education and Relevant Departments/Schools Negotiate: Measures for Handling Refugee Students

Divided into Four Aspects: Subsidizing Return to School, Economic Relief, Establishing Joint Middle Schools, and Regional Middle Schools

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 31st] The issue of resettling refugee students was briefly reported in this newspaper yesterday. It has now been learned that the Ministry of Education has held detailed consultations with the education departments of Shandong and Henan provinces and the principals of various middle schools and decided on the following measures: (1) Public middle schools that have resumed operations should immediately report to their respective schools, and the Ministry will subsidize the return travel expenses. Those who are indeed from communist-controlled areas and have no economic resources may be provided with relief in accordance with the relief measures for refugee students from communist-controlled areas in various provinces and cities. (2) For students from public middle schools that cannot be restored, the provincial education department should designate several schools to establish joint middle schools. (3) For students from county-run middle schools and private middle schools in counties that have not been recovered, the provincial education department should establish temporary middle schools to screen and admit them. The expenses incurred will be submitted to the Ministry for approval and disbursement by the provincial education department. (4) Students who do not comply with the above measures will have their relief suspended.

### Medieval Swordsmen Revisited Today: A Record of the Fencing Duel at the World Games Between France and Italy

— By Our Special Correspondent, Zhong Qing

[Our London Airmail Dispatch] The mention of "fencing" easily conjures up images of foreign heroes—swordsmen—who were once illustrious, awe-inspiring, agile, and filled with loyalty and righteousness, eliminating evil and suppressing treachery. In the medieval period, they left behind many glorious and brilliant heroic stories. However, in today's world, this martial art has gradually been eliminated. People can only see glimpses of fencing in martial arts films or occasionally in newsreels, rarely having the opportunity to witness it firsthand. Fencing is included as a formal competition item in the World Games. From July 30th to August 12th, for more than ten days, fencing competitions were held daily in the Engineering Palace, attracting a large number of curious spectators. The Engineering Palace was bustling with activity, with a heavy flow of traffic.

When the reporter entered the venue on the day of the fencing finals, it was during the rest period. I saw two contestants wearing connected white canvas clothing and trousers, practicing various stances. They wore white running shoes and white wire mesh helmets on their faces, looking like mummies displayed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo from afar. Each person carried a sword more than two feet long in their hands (with a triple-pointed head) and waited for the duel on a rubber carpet about 20 feet long. On the referee's stand beside the venue sat soldiers in army uniforms, exuding heroic spirit, wearing badges with crossed swords. Outside the venue on both sides stood the contestants who had not yet entered the arena, each with a radiant spirit and a fierce aura. The clothing of the contestants, including the chest, abdomen, and two sleeves, had electrical wires connected to a main plug in the buttocks behind the back. When the competition started, a retractable elastic transverse electrical wire, like a tape measure, was pulled out from a movable rotating machine next to the venue and inserted into the main plug behind the contestants. The contestants could still stretch and move freely without any hindrance during the competition. This electrical wire also connected to another electrical recording machine. Because fencing competitions involve rapid movements, making it difficult for the referee to distinguish whose sword tip touched the opponent first, even though the outcome was divided, this new electric testing machine overcame this difficulty.

The French fencing team and Italy were competing for the final championship. These are two ancient and eccentric countries in Europe, so the contestants in the arena were all "of great origin." Their ancestors were all skilled swordsmen in history, so the two teams were evenly matched. The movements of the contestants were agile, and the sword lights reflected, making it dizzying. The audience was always immersed in a tense and exciting atmosphere. The Italian team took the lead, with a powerful momentum, winning five consecutive victories out of six people. However, the ten French contestants who responded were also veterans who had been on the battlefield for a long time, so they were able to display their heroic might and defeat the Italian team, leaving no survivors, and finally won the final victory with a score of eleven to five.

### The Competition in News Reporting

— Cang

After the victory, there is a common feeling in the news industry circle, that is, the competition in news reporting has become white-hot. Field reporters tighten their nerves every day, trying to discover a unique piece of news to please their readers. Therefore, even if they are extremely sincere colleagues in private, they will inevitably become selfish when they enter the news circle of short-term competition. In order to compete for a piece of news, everyone intrigues and competes, which can lead to heated arguments and an unpleasant and awkward situation.

However, as early as thirty or forty years ago, the competition in news reporting in the local newspaper industry in Chicago in the United States was even more of a ferocious and vicious report with its claws and fangs! A newspaper often placed spies in the offices and machine rooms of its rival newspapers to sabotage the progress of the other party's work at any time. Sometimes, in order to surprise and win, they even kidnapped the other party's field reporters. The newspaper's old staff told reporters: Unique news is the red blood cell in the newspaper's sales volume. In order to win unique news, reporters should not hesitate to take any risks or commit any crimes; after discovering unique news, they should try to prevent other colleagues from obtaining it.

At that time, Walter Crowford Howcy was considered the most cunning and resourceful reporter in the Chicago newspaper industry. Before the age of twenty, Howey had already taken over as the editor of a newspaper. The news of the death of US President McKinley in 1901 was his masterpiece of unique acquisition. Originally, McKinley had been assassinated in the Falu area and had been lingering between life and death for a week. Howey predicted that he would die, so he wrote the news of President McKinley's death in advance, and also collected all the biographical history of Vice President Roosevelt, who succeeded McKinley, and arranged the layout. On the one hand, he also contacted the servants in the McKinley's house. As soon as McKinley died, whoever called him first to notify him would be given a reward of ten yuan. Therefore, within a few minutes of McKinley's death, Howey's newspaper was flying all over the street.

Howey is now also included in the list of famous Americans. People call him an editor and inventor. To date, he owns seventeen patents. Howey believes that to discover good news, it is most reliable to do it yourself. For example, one day, two car brokers and a sedan suddenly disappeared. A moment before the disappearance, the two car brokers drove a sedan to show the potential customer Churchill a sample. And now Churchill has also disappeared. This is an ordinary small piece of news.

When the police's attention was focused on the missing brokers, Howey paid attention to the whereabouts of the customer Churchill. He first found Churchill's hometown and called the local postmaster, who said: "That's right, Churchill just drove a new car home a few days ago. He is doing well in the big city. Everyone feels very honored." After Howey got this clue, he prepared two cars, one loaded with text and photography reporters, and the other loaded with three private detectives he hired. Arriving at the destination, the private detectives he hired caught Churchill, who stole the car, and rushed back to Chicago. Unexpectedly, another newspaper also got a clue, so it also mobilized a group of text and photography reporters, trying to intercept Howey and his party halfway and find a way to rob Churchill. If they really couldn't rob him, they would first take a photo and rush back to develop and print it, so they could get the scoop. Little did they know that Howey had also anticipated this move from the other newspaper and had made preparations in advance. The two groups encountered each other in a small town. After the pursuers followed step by step, they felt unable to rob Churchill, and finally followed him to a hotel. They saw two of Howey's private detectives handcuffing a person in the middle, so they grabbed a man's head without caring about the consequences, and drove back to the newspaper office at lightning speed. This joy was extraordinary, and they fully believed that they had grabbed a unique photo and news. Unexpectedly, when the photos were developed and identified, the person held by the detectives was clearly a reporter under Howey's command, resulting in a ridiculous situation! In fact, Howey had already arranged to lure the tiger away from the mountain and hid Churchill in another hotel, using a hidden tape recorder to obtain Churchill's full confession of murdering the car brokers. The next day, Howey's newspaper bragged again, saying: "This newspaper often takes exposing secret crimes as its consistent purpose, and this morning exclusively published the full and detailed confession of the murderer Churchill..."

But it would not be entirely true to point out that Howey is a person who specializes in playing tricks. At the very least, his wit, calmness, and various characteristics of his ability to discover his subordinates are enough to make him successful in any career. In addition, Howey is also a person who understands human relationships. Once, a poor little girl wrote a letter to Howey, begging him to take pity and find a house for her to live in. Howey used the most moving language and photos to publicize the little girl's life story in the newspaper every day. Finally, the old boss of a newspaper couldn't bear it anymore and immediately remitted 10,000 yuan to Howey, saying in a telegram: "Hurry up and buy a house for that girl, you have really hurt my heart!" The Guangzhou branch of the International Fourth Cultural Association recently published a small advertisement that read: "Do you feel troubled? Please learn the 'Gil Touberg' dance, and you can drive away your worries."

### The Best Way to Relieve Worries

— Jinjin

Indeed, the way to relieve worries is to enjoy yourself. And you must enjoy yourself in time. Extrapolating from this, if you think of watching a movie, going to a restaurant, or traveling with friends, etc., you must go immediately. Because in the busy lives of most people, it is very difficult to find a suitable time to enjoy yourself. You must get rid of work, have money in your pocket, be healthy, and have a strong interest before entertainment can be interesting. And when you think of entertainment, the objective situation must be closest to the above conditions. To give an example, you will never go to a restaurant to have a big meal when you have a toothache or happen to be short of money.

Secondly, in my opinion, entertainment should not be planned by selecting a location or date. Someone travels a long distance from one end of the city, takes a rickshaw, and rushes to a certain theater at the other end to see a play, only to find that it is sold out. Their frustration is beyond description. It would be better to stroll on the street and buy a ticket to sit in a theater that is not sold out and is showing a good play.

As for pre-arranged travel dates, it is often difficult to achieve your wishes or get satisfactory results due to unexpected personnel circumstances, unpredictable diseases, or even bad weather. The most interesting thing is that a miscellaneous news column in a certain issue of Time magazine stated that the meteorological society in a certain place in the United States determined that the weather would be clear on a certain day and invited local members to have a picnic in the suburbs. On that day, it happened to rain heavily, which not only disappointed the members who attended but also damaged the reputation of the meteorological society.

The author is not a passive advocate of "life is like a dream, how much joy can there be," nor is he a believer in the decadent justice of the so-called "end of the century." However, life needs work, but it also needs entertainment, especially when you are frustrated and worried, you need to use entertainment to refresh your spirits. A Western proverb says: "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." Although the wording is opposite, the meaning is the same.

### Modern Book Collectors

— Qian Dacheng

Before discussing modern book collectors, I must, reluctantly, play the role of a "literary plagiarist" and first copy a passage from Hong Liangji's "Northern River Poetry Talks" as an introduction. He said, "There are several types of book collectors: the first is one who, upon obtaining a book, invariably delves into its origins and corrects its errors; these are called collators. Examples include Qian Shaozhan Daxin and Dai Jishi Zhen. The second is one who distinguishes its printing blocks and annotates its mistakes; these are called proofreaders. Examples include Academician Lu Wenchao and Grand Secretary Weng Fanggang. The third is one who searches for variant editions, ascending to replenish what was lost from the Stone Chamber and Golden Cabinet, and descending to provide materials for scholars and doctors to peruse; these are called collectors. Examples include the Tianyi Pavilion of the Fan family in Yin County, the Flower Vase of the Wu family in Qiantang, and the Zhuanshi Building of the Xu family in Kunshan. The fourth is one who seeks only fine editions, particularly Song imprints; though the author's intentions may not be fully grasped, the years of printing are most thoroughly understood; these are called connoisseurs. Examples include Chief Clerk Huang Pilie of Wu Prefecture and Recluse Bao Tingbo of Qiu Town. The fifth is one who buys books cheaply from declining old families and sells them at a good price to wealthy book lovers; with discerning eyes and knowledge of ancient and modern books, no Fujian or Sichuan edition can deceive them, and Song and Yuan imprints are immediately recognized; these are called purveyors. Examples include Qian Jingkai and Tao Wuliu of Wu Prefecture, and Shi Hanying and other book dealers of Huzhou."

Today, the value of Huang Yaopu's collated and annotated editions far exceeds gold. However, Mr. Hong merely calls him a connoisseur. Purveyors like Tao Wuliu are now hard to find. Zhang Shizhai's "comprehensive understanding" is even harder to achieve. Book collectors of the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras all read their collections, or at least could "distinguish the genuine from the spurious and know the ancient and modern." What about today's book collectors? Many are true book collectors, collecting without reading. A wealthy merchant, having made some money, pretends to be refined, buying the Hundred-Patched Edition of the Twenty-Four Histories and the Four Series Collection on white paper, neatly arranging them in a bookcase, with uniform spines, always untouched and as good as new. Thus, no one asks about other books, and the Twenty-Four Histories and the Four Series Collection still have a market.

In the early years of the Republic of China, Tao Lanquan specialized in collecting books on Kaihua paper, even managing to buy a Kaihua paper edition of the Seventeen Histories from the Jigu Pavilion, earning him the nickname "Tao Kaihua."

Fu Yuanshu and Luo Zhenyu were certainly the greatest book collectors of the Republic of China, and Yuanshu could be called a proofreader. Both Fu and Luo published many books, and all were exquisitely done. However, Yuanshu's later years were marked by decline, and his collection was partly donated and partly sold to the public. He also collected and traded books, with exceptional vision. The booksellers of Beiping all dreaded him. Fu and Luo were traitors, and their collections were likely scattered after their deaths.

Two booksellers in the north are worth mentioning: Wang Wenjin of Wenlu Hall and Sun Dianqi of Tongxue Studio. They had a deep understanding of bibliography and edition studies, going beyond mere "comprehensive understanding." Although not book collectors, they were certainly in the same vein as Tao Wuliu and Qian Congmo. They were much better than those who hoard books, never read them, and treat them as commodities. In Changshu, there is a book collector whose two sons even split up their father's collected works, each taking half of each book. Such a jarring thing can be considered a strange phenomenon among book collectors.

### Random Musings on Pen Names

— You Mojun

The term "pen name" comes from abroad. In ancient China, we only had aliases, as seen in historical records. For example, the "Strategies of the Warring States" mentions Qin State's Huili Zi, which Gao You annotated as "there is a large Kui tree in his village, hence the alias Huili Zi." However, according to Zheng Qiao's "General Treatise," "Huili" is a place name. The "Strategies of the Warring States" also mentions Qin's recluse Hanquan Zi, which is a genuine alias. However, neither had any writings, so they cannot be said to be using pen names.

Pen names, in China, are called "temporary names." The earliest people to receive prizes for their writing were probably the poets of the Yuequan Poetry Society in the late Song and early Yuan dynasties. The champion, "Luo Gongfu," was actually Lian Wenfeng. The runner-up was "Qingshan Baiyun Ren" (Person of Green Mountains and White Clouds). Others included "Xiancun Ren" (Person of Immortal Village), "Shizi Gengfu" (Literate Ploughman), and "Qiniu Weng" (Ox-Riding Old Man). These were all true pen names. The prizes at the time were quite generous: the champion Luo Gongfu received "seven zhang of silk, five sticks of pens, and five ingots of ink."

The strangest pen name must be that of the ancient Bada Shanren (Eight Great Mountain Man): "Niu Shi Hui." These three characters together are difficult to understand; however, when written in cursive script, they become "Sheng Bu Bai Jun" (Born Not to Bow to a Ruler)! Bada Shanren was a member of the Ming imperial family who became a monk after the fall of the dynasty. Inscribing this pen name was truly shedding tears of blood. My late friend Master Hongyi had countless pen names. In his later years, he styled himself "Yi Yi Yi Laoren" (Old Man One One One), which some mistook as him emulating the Six One Layman. However, if one reads his "Dream Shadows of Ten Years in Southern Fujian," one would know that he took two "one" characters from the ancient poem "One thing not accomplished, man gradually ages" and Wu Meicun's deathbed poem "One penny not worth, what is there to say," thus becoming "Er Yi Laoren" (Old Man Two One)! This is so startling!

### Ma Sicong Has Arrived

— Tingyou

Listeners who frequently turn on their radios are all amazed by the recent flourishing of music in Shanghai. At first glance, this phenomenon is of course gratifying, but upon closer reflection, the reality is also quite sad: the public's interest is so strong, yet musical performances are so rare, so they can only turn to the limited number of records to temporarily satisfy their hunger. Most radio programs consist of a very limited number of classical music records, which are played day and night, and their sound has long lost its brilliance. Nevertheless, there are many who are infatuated with these records, as employees of radio stations are well aware.

At this time, Mr. Ma Sicong has arrived. This is great news after Ma Sihu's departure to the United States. This has aroused the excitement of many people.

To call Ma Sicong the Chinese Kreisler, I think, is not an exaggeration. His violin technique may not be as good as Kreisler's, but he is good at absorbing the essence of folk music for composition, which is similar to Kreisler, and his achievements are even better than Kreisler's.

What makes people hard to forget Ma Siting is not only his "string skills," but also his willingness to practice without blindly believing in his own imagination, absorbing the melodic essence of folk songs from Inner Mongolia, Tibet, and other places, and changing the traditional harmony rules to express the local customs and human feelings of the people of this country. I can never forget the homesickness song in Ma's work "Suiyuan Suite." No matter how Ma Sicong played it, the beauty and uniqueness of the violin music of the Chinese folk song style does not need to be described by my clumsy writing.

Although singing folk songs is popular recently, it is rare to see folk songs being infused into music, and there is no second person who has achieved as much as Ma Sicong. However, the work of developing the "National Music School" must be based on solid basic skills and rich cultivation. Therefore, while praising Ma Sicong, the main thing is to pay attention to first improving the technical level of general music learners and building a solid foundation, so there is no need to desperately make a fuss about slogans. Music should certainly belong to the people, but desperately posting slogans of "people's music" will definitely not help the actual situation!

### Discussions on Names and Surnames

The Old Capital Daily reported that the Chief of the China Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, "Leppham," has officially changed his Chinese translation name to "Lai Puhan." According to this name, there is not much difference in sound, and "Lai" is a Chinese surname, which is more suitable for the Chinese style than the former. From this, it can be seen that the Chinese style of names and surnames is attracting attention and interest from foreigners.

This mood seems to be initiated by England, and the current British Prime Minister "Attlee" was originally translated as "Ateli," and then at the suggestion of the British side was changed to the surname "Ai." Also, the British envoy to China in the early Republic of China, "Zhu Erdian," was originally the most crowning Chinese name. At that time, the President's Office was the official "Huang Kaiwen," and Zhu was very happy at the same time.

"Ai" and "Lai" are both in the same rhyme, which is especially coincidental. Although these two surnames are not very uncommon, there are not many historical celebrities. Most of the Chinese surnames are based on the ancient feudal system or official positions. The Lai surname is because there was a Lai country in the Spring and Autumn period, and the Ai surname is because the Qi doctor had an Ai Kong. As for later generations, there was Ai Yu in the Song Dynasty, who served as the Sima Nong; and Ai Xuan, an artist who was good at painting flowers, bamboos, and birds; Lai Fei in the Tang Dynasty, a literary scholar; Lai Wenjin in the Song Dynasty, a geographical expert. As for the former Qing Dynasty Yongzheng and Jiaqing dynasties, there was a Hanlin scholar each, and there were two Hanlin scholars in the Guangxu years.

The British first Ambassador to China, "Jia Degan," is similar to the Prime Minister of the State Council "Jia Deyao" during the old Duan Zhizheng era. "Xu Gesen," who was injured by Japanese planes in a car in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, has the same surname as Xu Shiying (Xu was also the Prime Minister of Duan at the time).

The surname of the British Prime Minister during the war, "Churchill," was originally "Qiu" in Chinese history. Emperor Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty, in order to avoid the taboo of Confucius, specially instructed that the character "　" should be added to all place names and surnames, making it "邱," and must be read "qi," so place names such as "Zhang邱," "Shang邱," and "Ren邱" were all added ㄎ, but people still read "Qiu" in their mouths, and no one was forbidden. If the "Qiu" of "Churchill" is read "qi" according to the sound limit set by Yongzheng, it will be far from the original sound.

### Reader Consulting, Legal Interpretation: Three Tenants Imprisoned for Drug Use, Second Landlord Takes the Opportunity to Terminate the Lease

Zhu Jinbao asked his friend Jia for Wan Shen for many years. One of his tenants, Wang, was sentenced by the court to one and a half years in prison for drug use. Since Wang was imprisoned, the room he lived in has been locked and no one is responsible for the rent. Now Jia wants to take back the room for his own use, but he has several questions. Please answer as follows: (1) In the above situation, if the landlord wants to take the house back for his own use, what are the procedures? (2) Should he first declare it to the Baojia office or file a case with the police station? (3) Can the furniture in the house be sold to offset the rent? (4) Should the tenant be notified or consulted in prison? What if he does not agree to the sale? (5) When carrying out the furniture change fee and taking back the house, how should it be proved and filed? (6) How to deal with a third party who wants to obstruct it for no reason?

[Lawyer Fu Kuanglin's reply] (1) He may sue the court to order the termination of the contract. (2) It is also feasible to have the head of the jia and the police officer read to the scene to prove that the house has been taken back. (3) You can refer to the provisions of Article 445, paragraph 2 of the Civil Law. You should send a letter to notify him that if you do not agree, you can apply to the court for auction. (5) It is most appropriate to sue the court for auction of the retained items and order the termination of the contract and the delivery of the house. (6) If a third party illegally interferes, he can report to the police to stop it or sue it.

### Poor Daughter Wishes to Give Away Her Children for Adoption

Huang Yuqing, a woman from Yong, is 25 years old. When she was 17 years old, she lived with a platoon leader and had a son and a daughter. The daughter is eight years old, and the son is still in diapers and in good shape. When Ms. Huang lived together, she did not know that her hometown in Lu Province was already full of children. After the incident, Ms. Huang was abandoned. She now lives on Baoshan Road, Zhabei, in this city. Because she has no means of making a living, she will become a starving prisoner. If any reader is willing to adopt her children and raise them to adulthood, it will be a great deed of merit. She herself is willing to work as a maid in order to make a living.
