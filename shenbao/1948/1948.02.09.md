### Restrictions on Japanese Textile Industry, No Agreement Reached Between China and the Allied Headquarters, Gu Weijun States Position to the U.S.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Regarding the issue of restricting Japanese industrial standards, Wang Yunwu has convened relevant ministries and commissions for discussions in recent days. China has agreed to the principles agreed upon by the Far Eastern Commission, namely that Japan's industrial standards should be based on the average living standards of the Japanese people between 1930 and 1934. However, our opinions with the Allied Headquarters regarding the interpretation of this living standard are still not consistent, especially regarding the standards of the Japanese textile industry. It is heard that the difference in opinion is still large. China advocates that the Japanese textile industry should only be allowed to retain 2.5 million spindles, while the Allied Headquarters is willing to allow the Japanese textile industry to retain 10 million spindles. No agreement has been reached yet. People in China's industrial circles have recently put forward their opinions on the standards of the Japanese textile industry, arguing that the ratio between the standards of the textile industries of China and Japan should be maintained at three to one. The maximum number of Japanese yarn spindles should not exceed 3 million. Gu Weijun, the ambassador, has informed the United States of the opinions of the Chinese government and people on the standards of the Japanese textile industry. According to a certain authoritative person, preventing Japan from engaging in aggression again requires not only restricting the development of its military industry as a necessary measure, but also imposing considerable restrictions on the textile industry, otherwise the Japanese textile industry will pose a great threat to China.

Under the broad principle of this suggestion, consideration must be given to the allocation of foreign exchange quotas for import and export, the increased production and transportation of coal mines, the overall planning of grain for people's livelihood in the North, and the maintenance and development of light and heavy industries in Peiping and Tianjin. The resources and people's hearts in the North are inseparable from the entire China, and their importance to Central and South China is self-evident. It is learned that the drafting of this recommendation letter will begin after the submission of the report.

### "The Chinese Communists I Know" Account After Two Foreign Missionaries Escape Danger

[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch, 8th] The Lu Zong has officially announced the rescue of two foreign female missionaries by the National Army in Biyang, western Henan, on the 19th of last month. One of the two female missionaries is American Hoover Mao (Chinese name) and the other is Canadian Rong Yaoqiu (Chinese name). After being driven out of the county town by Chen Geng's troops and rescued by the Luo Guangwen Division of the National Army, they jointly published an article "The Chinese Communists I Know" based on witnessing the crimes of the communist bandits. The full text is as follows:

After the Communist army occupied Biyang County for the third time, the situation was different from before. They quickly, without legal procedures, sent an illegal county magistrate and began to plunder those with a little savings in a brutal and enslaving manner, even using torture. Soon, this practice was applied to every class of society, and even the poorest people could not escape this disaster. We personally saw the Communist army using mule-drawn carts to transport large quantities of looted materials to their senior headquarters. This barbaric behavior was obviously allowed by the higher authorities. After this disaster in Biyang, thousands upon thousands of people will be threatened by hunger and death in the next two months, because these innocent people have been looted by the Communist army and have nothing left. After Biyang was occupied by the Communist army for three weeks, every department in the city fell under the control of the communists. They once publicly claimed that the communists advocate religious freedom, but the facts finally testified to the liars. Originally, they always "said one thing and did another." At first, we foreign missionaries did not encounter any major obstacles, and we hoped that this peaceful missionary life could continue under their supervision, but things went against our wishes, and disaster soon came upon us.

### Washington Circles Value Aid to China, Considering It a New Step in Far-Reaching Policy, Fierce Debate on Aid to Foreign Countries Expected in Both Houses of Congress

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] According to authoritative sources, the outcome of China's reform of the currency system and the loan from the United States will depend on the passage of the $570 million aid to China bill. The plan for the use of the $570 million will be expanded according to the plan previously formulated, because this loan is paid in installments, and one part is replaced by materials, so it cannot be used to reform the currency system. According to experts' estimates, the amount of Chinese legal currency issued in November last year was 28 trillion yuan. Adding the amount issued in December and January of this year, the total amount should be around 35 trillion yuan. If there are 300 to 500 million U.S. dollars as a fund for reforming the currency system, then the reform of China's currency system can be fully prepared.

[United Press Washington Dispatch, 7th] The U.S. government is determined to prevent a comprehensive economic collapse in China and is preparing to allocate $570 million for this purpose. U.S. authoritative figures all said that Secretary of State Marshall's decision to propose the $570 million aid to China plan has international political significance behind the scenes.

[Associated Press Washington Dispatch, 7th] Diplomatic circles reported on the evening of the 7th: The government's request for $570 million in aid to China shows an important new step in U.S. Far East diplomacy. At the same time, aid to Japan will also reach $175 million, and aid to Korea will reach $75 million, so that countries destroyed by the war can economically recover.

Diplomatic circles here believe that the three aid plans for China, Japan, and Korea clearly represent a new decision by the State Department to build anti-communist barriers in the Far East.

[Central News Agency Washington Dispatch, 7th] According to today's survey of opinions from all parties here, the new aid to foreign countries plan proposed by the State Department with an estimated expenditure of 9.3333 billion U.S. dollars over 15 months (including $570 million in aid to China) will encounter strong opposition when a comprehensive debate is launched in both houses of Congress at the end of this month. The Republican Party will rise up and advocate reducing this huge figure. A certain opponent of the party said: "The American people cannot tolerate this huge figure." However, supporters of the State Department's plan expressed the hope that this appropriation could be approved on April 1.

[Associated Press Washington Dispatch, 7th] Senator Wheeler, the leader of the revisionist faction of the Marshall Plan, said: The government's proposed 9.333 billion aid to foreign countries plan is really unbearable for the American people, and the American economy cannot consider this figure. Xiang Wheeler said: Representatives of the Senate revisionist faction held a meeting on the 7th, chaired by Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to discuss possible changes.

### Economic Reform Plan - Implementation Measures for Water Conservancy

[Report from our Nanjing Office] Regarding the implementation measures for the Yongli portion of the economic reform plan, the National Economic Council, at its 31st regular meeting, decided to have the Ministry of Water Conservancy revise and submit a revised proposal. The Ministry of Water Conservancy has drafted new implementation measures based on the original implementation measures, and submitted them to the National Economic Council, which passed them with revisions on the 5th. The full text of the implementation measures is recorded below:

Original Plan B.1.(3) Agricultural reform, with water conservancy as the priority. Large-scale water conservancy projects and the construction of main canals should be actively undertaken by the state. The construction of small-scale water conservancy projects and branch canals should be supervised by the central government for implementation by the provinces and counties, with permission to issue water conservancy bonds. Completed projects shall be the responsibility of local authorities for maintenance. Implementation measures:

1.  River Management

(1) To eliminate flooding and revitalize water conservancy, emphasis should be placed on the fundamental management and guidance of rivers across the country. (2) Fundamental plans for major rivers should be based on comprehensive surveys of various data, focusing on "regulation," "storage," "diversion," "dredging," and embankment construction, as well as the development of channels, with detailed investigations, meticulous planning, and comparative designs to formulate plans. (3) Flooding from the Yellow River has been a problem since ancient times, while the Northwest regions suffer from drought. The main objectives of managing the Yellow River should be flood prevention and irrigation, supplemented by hydropower development and channel improvement, under mutually beneficial conditions. The fundamental plan should be actively prepared and completed within a specified timeframe. (4) The fundamental plan for the Yangtze River should prioritize navigation and hydropower, while still considering flood control and irrigation benefits. This plan should be completed as soon as possible, and important tributaries should be planned in coordination, with priority implementation. (5) Fundamental plans for the main waterways and tributaries involving more than two provinces or municipalities should be formulated and implemented by the central government, prioritizing them based on importance and urgency. Fundamental management of minor waterways will be managed by local governments. (6) The responsible authorities for river embankments should pay attention to repairs and strict defense to prevent embankment breaches. Local administrative officials should organize the public, gather labor and materials locally, and be responsible for participating in the work. (7) Embankments damaged during the war that have not been fully repaired should be urgently repaired to reach one meter above the highest flood level. (8) Culverts and sluice gates damaged during the war should be repaired immediately. Those that have not yet been built should be constructed quickly to facilitate drainage. (9) Silting rivers and waterways blocked during the war should be dredged and managed separately.

2.  Implementing Irrigation

(1) State allocation of funds for project implementation. A. In accordance with the provisions of this plan that "the construction of main canals should be actively undertaken by the state," the government should improve existing large-scale irrigation projects and actively allocate funds for new irrigation projects based on the needs of the people, with particular attention to irrigation projects in the Northwest provinces. B. The funds needed for irrigation projects should first be allocated by the government from the farmland water conservancy fund for irrigation work. Starting from the year following the completion of the project, the provincial government should collect water fees from the benefited fields on a yearly basis, in accordance with regulations, to repay the principal and interest for cyclical utilization. The collection methods and standards shall be determined by the Ministry of Water Conservancy in consultation with the respective provincial governments. C. The review standards for irrigation projects should be based on the principles of complete planning, superior benefits, convenient construction conditions, and short completion time. D. Project implementation shall be carried out in the following two ways: (1) The central competent authority shall be responsible for construction; (2) The local government shall be responsible for construction. E. After the completion of the project, the local government should manage and maintain it in accordance with the "Irrigation Project Management and Maintenance Regulations" promulgated by the Executive Yuan on September 19, 1944. F. The water fees collected by the provincial government for completed irrigation projects, in addition to being used for management and maintenance expenses, should be used to repay the work funds allocated by the central government and then used to replenish the local farmland water conservancy fund.

(2) Implementing projects with farmland water conservancy loans. A. In order to actively carry out new irrigation projects, the Farmers Bank of China should, starting from 1948, increase farmland water conservancy loans in areas where irrigation needs to be urgently developed, and make every effort to utilize the cooperative societies of various provinces and counties to promote well drilling and pond digging loans. B. Projects that have not been completed in various provinces should be accelerated and completed within a specified time limit. Completed projects should be properly managed and maintained, and the principal and interest should be repaid in kind starting from the year following the completion of the project. C. Loan procedures should be simplified as much as possible to meet construction needs. The approval of next year's loans should be completed one month before the start of the year. After the loan is approved, it should be fully allocated at one time, and the use of the loan should be strictly supervised, and the current loan interest rate should be reduced so that various places can universally carry out irrigation projects. D. After the loan is granted, various provinces should quickly establish sound construction institutions and complete the projects as planned within the time limit.

(3) Supervising local implementation of irrigation projects. A. According to the provisions of this plan that "the construction of branch canals should be supervised by the central government for implementation by the provinces and counties, with permission to issue water conservancy bonds," the local government should, based on the needs, apply for the issuance of water conservancy bonds as a local farmland water conservancy fund. For irrigation projects that have been completed in various provinces, counties, and cities, whether utilizing loans or funded by the state, the local government can also collect fees based on the amount of benefited acres, as a local farmland water conservancy fund. The aforementioned fund can be managed and utilized by a fund management committee established by the local government. B. Provincial, county, and municipal governments should utilize idle labor to universally construct irrigation projects and dig ponds. C. Larger irrigation projects that cannot be built by the people themselves can apply to the local government for a loan from the local farmland water conservancy fund or apply for a farmland water conservancy loan from the Farmers Bank of China. The local government should also provide assistance as much as possible. D. For completed irrigation projects, people should be urged to manage and maintain them in accordance with the irrigation project management and maintenance regulations.

3.  Managing Waterways

(1) To develop shipping, attention should be paid to the management of waterways, the opening of canals and harbors, and the connection of water and land transportation. (2) In managing waterways, priority should be given to trunk lines that have important economic value for transportation or can be coordinated with other water conservancy construction. (3) In opening canals, priority should be given to those that connect two adjacent river systems. (4) In opening harbors, they should be coordinated with the water and land transportation network, and harbor projects that are intertwined with water trunk lines should be implemented first. (5) Waterways and harbors damaged during the war that have not been repaired should be completed immediately, and the depth of the channel should be maintained to at least the required standard. (6) Waterways that have been managed during the war should continue to be managed and maintained separately to ensure long-term use.

4.  Developing Hydropower

(1) The development of hydropower should be coordinated with flood control navigation and irrigation projects of various rivers. (2) The selection of factory locations should be coordinated with the needs of industry. (3) In the initial stage of water conservancy projects, the Southwest provinces should be prioritized for development, with emphasis on the Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou areas. (4) Water conservancy projects in the Northeast should be temporarily based on the demand when controlled by the enemy. (5) In Taiwan, in addition to projects that should be restored immediately, projects that have not yet been completed should be reviewed for necessity and selected for resumption. (6) Water conservancy projects in other regions should be developed based on the needs, prioritizing them based on urgency and importance. (7) Private hydropower projects should be handled by the competent authorities in accordance with the "Measures for Encouraging and Assisting Private Hydropower Industry" approved and promulgated by the Executive Yuan on May 20, 1944.

### Implementation Measures for the Transportation Sector

The original Plan Four of the economic reform plan, implementation measures for the transportation sector, has been reviewed and completed and was also passed with revisions at the National Economic Council on the 5th. The full text is as follows:

(1) The management of commercial ports shall be determined by the Ministry of Transportation, in accordance with the needs of water transport, and the important and secondary commercial ports along the coast and inland rivers shall be separately designated and announced. The important commercial ports shall be built, managed, and operated by the Ministry of Transportation in accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Port Regulations. Secondary commercial ports may be operated by the provinces and municipalities after being approved by the central government, and the central government shall provide economic and technical assistance. (2) For the dredging of waterways, the Ministry of Transportation shall, for the needs of navigation, divide the inland waterways of the country into several regions, coordinate with the commercial port construction plan, and after being approved, the waterways directly connected to seaports shall be dredged by the Ministry of Water Conservancy. The waterways within one province shall be dredged by the municipal and county governments. (3) Increasing the tonnage of private shipping vessels. China's shipping policy has always emphasized both state-owned and private operations. In the future, private shipping should continue to be encouraged to meet the Ministry of Transportation's plan to increase vessels to 1.5 million tons.

### On This Year's National General Budget (Part 1)

— Zhang Baiyi

Because the nurturing government's policies are about to be implemented, the current transitional government cannot formulate this year's policy guidelines. Therefore, the national general budget for this year is only prepared for the first half of the year, that is, January to June of this year is temporarily used as the fiscal year, and the budget figures are used in accordance with the budget and additions of the previous year. According to the report of Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan on the 5th of this month and the results of the review by the joint meeting of the Legislative Yuan, the total budget amount is 962,766,000,000,041 yuan, and the total budget amount of revenue (excluding debt income) is 583,408,969,700 yuan. We are quite optimistic about the above-mentioned total budget amount. If the total revenue of this year can account for more than 61% of the total expenditure, from the perspective of the principle of balanced revenue and expenditure, it must be said that the financial situation is gradually tending to be on the right track.

According to the Nanjing special dispatch of Shen Bao on January 14: "Director Xu of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance stated that this year's budget will not use the inflation policy to make up for the deficit, and will try its best to ensure that there will be no additional budget. The deficit will be made up by reforming the tax system and increasing the special donation for relief." If the government authorities can truly fulfill this guarantee, then it would not be an exaggeration to say that the prospect of this year's budget is gradually becoming optimistic.

However, we must consider several preconditions for the budget for the first half of this year: First, is the total budget expenditure of more than 96 trillion yuan sufficient to represent the true meaning of the national finance for suppressing the rebellion and building the country? Second, is the total budget expenditure for this year really guaranteed that there will be no additional budget? Third, does the current system of tax collection and expenditure of public funds guarantee that there will be no continued waste due to corruption? Fourth, is there no need or possibility of continuing to implement the public debt policy? Fifth, is it necessary to reform the micro-collection technology of state-owned property income? Sixth, is it necessary to thoroughly reorganize the large amount of domestic public debt accumulated by the government over the years? According to my research, in order to free China's finance from the shackles of the old ideas of the established financial school of "finance for finance," in order to thoroughly reorganize China's finance before and after the reform of this currency and establish a permanent and sound foundation for the future, and in order for the Chinese government to use financial power to achieve the goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the country, special consideration must be given to the aforementioned six issues when preparing this year's budget, so as to seek an overall solution. Based on my research, I would like to explain and suggest the causes, meanings, and solutions of the above six issues below, for the reference of government leaders, legislators, and financial experts for joint research.

Regarding the first issue, whether the total expenditure has the meaning of national finance for suppressing the rebellion and building the country. It cannot be denied that China's finance at this time is indeed wartime finance, and at the same time, it must also be finance for building the country. This is no different from the finance for resisting Japan and building the country during the War of Resistance Against Japan. War has no distinction between domestic and foreign, and finance has become a link in participating in the war. Recalling the words of British Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George during World War I: "We will, like Napoleon in wartime, must obtain the final victory over our financial strength." Also, during World War II, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Siman also made a famous statement in his first budget speech: "Finance is the fourth convoy of national defense. If finance fails, the entire power to support the war will collapse immediately." This is enough to prove the close relationship between finance and war and the importance of finance in wartime. If there is no war, then so be it. Once there is war, there is no distinction between domestic and foreign. This rule must not change.

At the same time, one of the main tasks of the government in building the country is to complete the industrial plan in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's plan for building the country. Chairman Chiang of the National Government also proposed a ten-year economic construction plan in his book "China's Destiny" based on the industrial plan. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, we did not forget to build the country. During the period of suppressing the rebellion, we should not forget to complete the economic construction on the industrial front. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was precisely because we advanced in both resisting Japan and building the country at the same time that we were able to resist for a long time and achieve the final victory. During this period of suppressing the rebellion, its dangers are no less than the Japanese imperialism's invasion of China with a puppet government. Therefore, at this time, we must advance in both suppressing the rebellion and building the country at the same time, so that we can combat the second kind of puppet, which is more dangerous and hateful, and so that we can resist the intrusion of the emerging imperialist forces into China for a long time. And the important means of completing the construction of the country must rely on financial strength. For example, American financial expert Professor C.C. Plehn believed in his book "The Theory of Financial Policy" that "Soviet finance is the lever of the five-year economic plan." From this, it can be seen that finance is also the main driving force for economic construction.

Therefore, finance, whether in terms of war or construction, occupies the most important position. Today's finance is by no means finance for finance. Today's finance should be finance for enriching the country and strengthening the military. According to my knowledge, the government's financial policy seems to be intentionally or unintentionally restricted by the criticisms and accusations of vulgar economists or political economists, and often takes a conservative tendency. Therefore, what is expressed in the financial policy is to follow the old ways, that is, to deal with each situation, only treating the head when it hurts and treating the feet when they hurt. This tendency must be thoroughly eliminated; otherwise, the work of suppressing the rebellion this year will not be fundamentally ended, and if there is no foreign aid, it may also lead to difficulties in finance itself, which will affect the entire military, political, and economic situation. Now, let's first study the problem of the total amount of the budget expenditure for the first half of this year, which is 96 trillion yuan. The actual value of the legal tender is definitely not as low as the market standard, but today's price increase has reached 15 trillion, which is a fait accompli. Before the legal tender continues to roam the market and does not return to the bank for deposit, most of the government's expenditures will probably have to be based on the market price standard that has become a fait accompli. If the national general budget of 96 trillion yuan is converted into only about 600 million yuan of pre-war legal tender, and if the whole year is estimated based on this standard, it will only be 1.2 billion yuan. The pre-war budget in our country was also about this number, but at that time the area for suppressing the rebellion was very small. Therefore, it is pointed out that it is necessary to consider increasing the total expenditure of 96 trillion yuan. At the same time, according to my plan, if the government wants to end the important part of the work of suppressing the rebellion this year, its military expenditure must be increased to account for 50% of the total expenditure; if the government wants to implement Chairman Chiang's ten-year economic construction plan this year, its construction expenditure must be increased to account for 25% of the total expenditure; if the government wants to increase the living expenses of civil servants and teachers this year to stabilize their lives and improve administrative efficiency, its living expenses for civil servants and teachers (living allowances for military personnel are included in the military expenditure) must be increased to account for 10% of the total expenditure; if the government wants to repay all domestic debts and foreign currency public debts issued in the country this year, the debt expenses must account for 5% of the total expenditure; other political expenses will account for 10%. Therefore, the budget and content I suggest should be as follows: the total expenditure for half a year is 150 trillion yuan, of which military expenditure is 75 trillion yuan, economic construction expenditure is 37.5 trillion yuan, civil servants' living expenses are 15 trillion yuan, other political expenses are 15 trillion yuan, and debt expenses (domestic debt) are 7.5 trillion yuan. Military expenditure includes military pay and combat materials. All education expenses related to economic construction are included in economic construction expenditure, and debt expenses are prepared for one-time repayment of various wartime and post-war bonds (the reasons will be detailed later).

We must pay attention to the importance of ideological warfare in the position of war. Increasing the living standards of the army can develop and enhance combat power; increasing the living standards of civil servants can strengthen administrative efficiency and reduce corruption.

In the 25th year of the Republic of China, on the eve of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when the National Government prepared the budget for the 23rd year of the Republic of China, in order to enrich the national strength, it specially formulated a five-year plan and raised special funds for construction. The budget was divided into two types: ordinary expenditure and construction special funds expenditure, just like the United States during the economic recovery period, dividing the budget into two major items: ordinary expenditure and recovery and relief expenditure (Generol Expenditures and Recovey & Relief Expendilures). At that time, the construction special funds were listed as 400 million yuan, accounting for about one-third of the total budget at that time. Therefore, I now propose 37.5 trillion yuan for economic construction expenditure (equivalent to 250 million yuan of pre-war legal tender), accounting for 25% of the total amount, similar to the plan for the 23rd year of the Republic of China.

Some people may say that if this huge budget is put into practice, it may still be compensated by issuing a large amount of currency, and it will cause more vicious inflation. However, I have considered this, and the amount is not too large. It can be met with sufficient financial resources, and there is no need to rely on issuance. This point will be discussed later.

Now let's look at the second issue, that is, whether this year's budget guarantees that there will be no additional budget. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan until this year, the annual budget expenditure and the actual expenditure of the national treasury have not been able to meet. The reason for this is that the continuous rise in prices over the years has caused the government agencies to constantly increase the numbers paid by emergency orders, or to supplement the additional budget procedures according to law after the emergency order, or to no longer make this additional procedure after the emergency order funds are received, so that the actual expenditure of the national treasury has greatly exceeded the budget. Without mentioning the builders, take last year as an example. The total expenditure budget for last year was 9.32 trillion yuan, but the actual expenditure of the national treasury reached 40 trillion yuan by the end of December, exceeding it by more than three times. Whether this year's budget can guarantee that this phenomenon will not occur again depends on whether prices are stable at today's standard of 150,000 times as a prerequisite. According to Minister Yu Hongjun of the Ministry of Finance, it is guaranteed that this year will definitely not use issuance to make up for the deficit. This is indeed a wise statement and promise. If the deficit is not made up by issuance, then the cycle of government expenditure, price increases, and currency inflation can be eradicated. However, I believe that this promise alone cannot achieve the perfect goal. We must use the relationship between finance and finance to maximize the power of absorbing idle funds and controlling national purchasing power in order to achieve the expected results.

Here, we should pay close attention to the deposit problem of national banks, bureaus, and libraries and commercial banks and villages across the country. According to the survey of the Four Joint Offices, the statistics of time deposits and savings deposits of national banks, bureaus, and libraries are as follows: (1) The total amount of time deposits was 46.3 billion yuan as of the end of June last year, but there were 685,146,000 yuan at the end of 1937. (2) The total amount of savings deposits was 725.3 billion yuan as of the end of June last year, but there were 188,488,000 yuan at the end of 1937. (3) The total amount of trust deposits was 184.4 billion yuan as of the end of June last year, but there were 26,458,000 yuan at the end of 1937. The above total time deposits (including trust deposits) and savings deposits totaled 956 billion yuan, which was about 1 trillion yuan by the end of last year. However, this deposit was more than 900 million yuan at the end of 1934. At that time, 900 million yuan was converted to today's market price, which is about 135 trillion yuan today, and this huge amount of deposit is equivalent to the full annual budget of the Chinese government before the war. And today's 100 million yuan of national bank deposit in legal tender is calculated to be only 6.66 million yuan of pre-war legal tender. From this, it can be seen that at the end of 1937, the national banks and bureaus controlled and utilized as much as 900 million yuan in deposits, which was especially important for controlling national purchasing power. If today's national banks, bureaus, and libraries can have the power of 135 trillion yuan of legal tender (that is, equivalent to 900 million yuan of pre-war legal tender deposits), then the control of national purchasing power will be extremely effective. Today is not what it used to be, which is obviously visible. In other words, today's national banks, bureaus, and libraries have lost their banking functions, and they can only helplessly sigh at the sight of the people's purchasing power!

At the same time, we want to look at the deposits of commercial banks and villages across the country. According to the Central Bank, as of September last year, time deposits were only 417.1 billion yuan, and demand deposits were 2421.8 billion yuan, totaling 2838.9 billion yuan. By the end of last year, time deposits were estimated to be 800 billion yuan, and if converted to pre-war legal tender at 150,000 times the price, it would be only 5.33 million yuan. However, at the end of 1937, the commercial banks and villages had 652,150,000 yuan in interbank deposits in the national banks and bureaus.

According to the above figures for time deposits (including savers and trust deposits) of national banks, bureaus, and libraries and commercial banks and villages across the country, the total was 1.552 billion yuan at the end of 1937, and in fact it was only 12 million yuan at the end of 1947 (converted to pre-war legal tender according to market prices). The multiple of decline is about 129.5 times, that is, the value of time deposits at the end of 1947 is less than 8 per thousand of the total amount of time deposits at the end of 1937.

If we take the total amount of time deposits of public and private banks and villages at the end of 1937 at the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan as the standard of 1.552 billion yuan, and convert it to today's legal tender at today's market price, then the amount of time deposits of public and private banks and villages today should be 232.8 trillion yuan, but the fact shows that it is only 1417.1 billion yuan. This fact is enough to prove that today's national financial institutions, regardless of national banks, bureaus, or commercial banks and villages, have completely lost their original banking functions. The so-called rampant speculation of idle funds today is actually the result of a large number of bank deposits escaping from the bank and roaming the market. It is not the so-called idle funds. At the same time, it can also prove that today's price increases cannot be entirely blamed on issuance, because today's issuance by the Central Bank is definitely not this number.

As the agency for implementing the national general budget, the Ministry of Finance must pay special attention to this fact now that the budget for this year has already begun, and especially for this problem, it must immediately implement policies and measures that are targeted at reality and make effective solutions. In this way, the emergency order payment book will no longer continue to appear in this year's budget, and in this way, the additional budget can be stopped, and in this way, this year's budget can be controlled.

### What I Know About the Chinese Communists

[Continued from Page 1] That illegally appointed county head, with his hideous face and venomous heart, came personally to our church and even rushed into my bedroom. Using the tone of an autocratic ruler, he ordered us to leave Biyang immediately. But you must understand, in the Communist-controlled area, a person cannot "take a single step" without their "passport," and it's even harder for foreigners. At that time, he only allowed us to have a "travel permit." This "travel permit" had no special protection whatsoever; it only stated the reason for our expulsion, "which was merely their pretext." On the morning of January 19th, two or three Communist government officials came to inspect the limited luggage we were allowed to carry and forced us to set off at noon. At that time, we learned a terrifying piece of news from others: the Communists were planning to bury us alive on the road after we left the city. Simultaneously, we received information that the Nationalist army had arrived not far from the city. The illegally appointed Communist county head sent people to force us to leave, but those helping us with our luggage deliberately delayed, obviously aware that the Nationalist army was arriving soon. It wasn't until 3 PM that everything was prepared and we were just about to leave when suddenly we heard gunfire outside the city. This was the signal that the Nationalist army had arrived in Biyang. Now it was our turn to watch the Communist Party's antics. The Communist soldiers ran around in chaos, trying to find a place to hide their true colors. Later, that illegally appointed county head and the villains who were lying in wait outside the city to bury us alive were all captured alive by the Nationalist army. We thank God for the omnipotence of the Nationalist army that rescued us. When the Nationalist army entered the city, we received a warm welcome from all the townspeople. That genuine and enthusiastic emotion surpassed even the joy we felt when Japan surrendered! After we were rescued, everyone advised us to leave this turbulent place temporarily. The Fourth Army Commander General agreed to allow us to travel with the army to Queshan. We traveled with the army for five days, receiving their courtesy and assistance. The officers and soldiers of this unit were all suffering greatly, moving through the icy and snowy conditions. Some soldiers had no shoes or socks, and sometimes food was not available. However, the officers and soldiers of the army still faithfully carried out the orders given to them by the government; no matter where they went, the officers and soldiers were so polite to the people, engaging only in fair buying and selling, never infringing on the people's interests. We sincerely pray that the officers and soldiers of the army striking against the Communist Party will be strong and victorious.

Five thousand yuan worth of gold standard banknotes are flying around the market, and prices for all goods are rising uniformly. The market is in chaos. Those with idle capital are frantically buying in, while small merchants lacking funds are at a loss.

### Overview of Labor Welfare Education by the Ministry of Social Affairs

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The Ministry of Social Affairs has always attached great importance to labor welfare. It has promulgated the Regulations on Employee Welfare Funds and its Implementing Rules, the Organizational Regulations of Employee Welfare Committees, and the Measures for the Establishment of Employee Welfare Societies, and has strengthened supervision and implementation. In addition to supervising and urging social education institutions in various provinces and cities to mobilize factories, mines, and other enterprises and trade unions to earnestly carry out various employee welfare undertakings, the Ministry has also assigned supervisors to directly supervise the implementation in their respective supervised areas. According to assessments, as of the end of 1947, the number of welfare institutions established in various provinces and cities to handle welfare affairs was as follows: in terms of factories, mines, and other enterprises, there were 217 employee welfare committees, 250 employee welfare societies, and a total of 7,792 operational facilities, benefiting 564,859 employees; in terms of trade unions and related social organizations, there were 100 trade union welfare committees, 18 worker welfare committees, 189 worker welfare societies, and a total of 1,196 operational facilities. In addition, in order to provide guidance and demonstration for handling labor welfare, the Ministry established a directly affiliated Nanjing Worker Welfare Society last year. After all construction and equipment were completed on schedule, it officially started operation and gradually developed business related to worker welfare, such as tea rooms, cafeterias, barbershops, bathhouses, laundries, sewing, sales, reading, recreation, sports, personnel, service, and medical care. As of the end of last year, the number of beneficiaries had reached 222,972. As for the promotion of labor education, relevant labor education laws and regulations such as the Measures for Promoting Vocational Supplementary Education in Public and Private Factories and Mines and Utilizing Equipment to Provide Practical Training for Vocational School Students, the Supplementary School Law, and the Supplementary School Rules have been formulated and promulgated in conjunction with relevant agencies. In addition, the Measures for the Establishment of Employee Welfare Societies lists supplementary schools or classes and children's schools as one of the main business facilities of welfare societies. Since its implementation, it has achieved results. As of the end of 1947, factories and mines had 331 supplementary schools and 286 children's schools. Trade unions had 77 supplementary schools and 85 children's schools. Other agencies and social organizations had 24 supplementary schools and 14 children's schools. The above is an overview of the promotion of labor welfare and labor education. In the future, we will continue to strengthen implementation in accordance with established policies in order to achieve the goal of improving workers' lives and promoting production efficiency.

### Sudden Turnaround in Japanese Political Situation: Katayama Cabinet Set to Resign En Masse This Morning; Various Parties May Form Coalition Cabinet

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Japanese Prime Minister Katayama, in order to unify the Socialist Party internally, had already decided to implement the resignation en masse of the cabinet yesterday, but he had not obtained the consent of the ministers. As a result, the effort was postponed to today. After striving to persuade the ministers, it was decided to hold the final cabinet meeting at 9:00 AM tomorrow (9th) to formally announce the resignation en masse of the cabinet.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] The Japanese political situation took a sudden turn for the worse today, breaking the chaotic situation of the past few days. The Katayama Cabinet has announced its resignation en masse. As such, the issue of the next cabinet is attracting considerable attention from observers. The possibility of a second Katayama Cabinet or a coalition cabinet of the Liberal and Democratic parties is extremely low. Based on the current situation, the possible outcomes are: a united national cabinet of various parties (Ashida as Prime Minister); a Central New Party cabinet (Ashida as Prime Minister); and a national salvation conservative new party cabinet (Yoshida as Prime Minister). However, since all three cabinets would exclude the Socialist Party from the cabinet, the organization work is quite difficult. Judging from the attitude of the members of various parties toward the next regime, the Democratic Party accounts for the largest number of supporters of a united national cabinet of various parties, with 95 members, the National Cooperative Party with 36 members, the All Farmers faction with 16 members under possible conditions, the First Member Club with about 8 members, the Farmers Party with 7 members, and unaffiliated members with 5 members, for a total of 159 members. If the Socialist Party does not split and supports this cabinet as a whole, there will be a total of 282 members. Even if the left wing splits and removes 50 members, it will still reach 232 members, which is enough to control more than half of the current total of 446 members. Secondly, for the Central New Party Cabinet, in addition to the direct line of the Ashida New Party, about 20 members of the Democratic Party who have withdrawn from the party, and other small factions will support it in the same way as the First Club. Also, the Socialist Party will not split, and the left wing has already stated that it will not support it, so its supporting forces are about 223 members, which accounts for about half of the current total number of members. This is the maximum number. Among the All Farmers, First, Farmers, and other factions, there are still about 10 members who are questionable. As for the national salvation conservative cabinet, with the entire 119 members of the Liberal Party and the entire 22 members of the Comrades Club as the core, about 40 members of the Democratic Party will participate, and the All Farmers and Farmers factions will participate under possible conditions. The First Member Club will have 8 members, and there will be 1 unaffiliated member, for a total of 213 members. Taken together, the possibility of a coalition cabinet of various parties is the greatest, followed by the Central New Party Cabinet. The feasibility of a national salvation conservative new party cabinet led by Yoshida seems to be weaker. However, if the Socialist Party's left wing splits and takes independent action, the supporting forces of these two or three parties will be no more than 120 or 130 members, and the departure of small factions and the possibility of the emergence of a Yoshida-led cabinet will be the greatest. In this view, the key to the political situation is now in the hands of the left wing of the Socialist Party. Therefore, the trend of the next political situation after the resignation en masse of the Katayama Cabinet also depends on the attitude of the left wing and its unity.

### Gandhi Assassination Case: Conspiracy Group Cracked

Alwar State Suspected of Involvement, Under Investigation

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 7th] It is reported that during the investigation into the assassination of Gandhi, the Indian detective team has cracked a nationwide conspiracy group that attempted to assassinate the highest leaders of the Congress Party and its ministers. It is said that nearly 20 people joined the assassination group, including Sikhs and natives of Punjab and Bombay provinces. The team also discovered a storage site for military supplies, bombs, grenades, revolvers, and machine guns. In Delhi, more than 200 members of the All-India National Servants Society and the Hindu Mahasabha have been arrested. The hunt for assassination groups in other cities is still ongoing. The Standing Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha will soon convene to discuss the reorganization of the association to reduce its anti-Muslim characteristics and perpetuate the new situation created by Gandhi's death.

[United Press, New Delhi, 7th] The investigation into the assassination of Gandhi reached a critical point today. The Indian government has taken over the state of Alwar and summoned its ruler and prime minister to New Delhi for preliminary investigation. The announcement stated that this emergency measure was necessary for a successful investigation, as the state government is accused of supporting or acquiescing to the actions of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which may be implicated in the Gandhi assassination case and other major crimes. The state's Maharaja Tej Singh and Prime Minister Jiram Rika have arrived here and have been ordered to stay for at least one month to facilitate the investigation. The Indian government has appointed Van Cataysha as the interim administrator of the state. The state covers 3,158 square miles and has a population of one million.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 7th] The Indian Postal Service has decided to issue Gandhi commemorative stamps starting next month, in denominations of two and a half annas and twelve annas.

### Building an Anti-Communist Fortress in the Middle East: Truman Doctrine Should Be Extended to Iran; House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee Proposes

[United Press, Washington, 7th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee's subcommittee stated on the evening of the 7th that the United States will "seriously consider" extending the anti-communist military aid program for Turkey and Greece to Iran. The subcommittee stated that the United States should take steps to achieve air superiority, so that in the event of an incident, it can quickly move to defend the Middle Eastern oil fields. What Iran needs is for the United States to assist it in building its 100,000-strong army into an effective fighting force. Currently, Iran is very vulnerable to invasion. The committee issued this report after learning that Iran had rejected the Soviet Union's protest on the 6th. The Soviet Union had protested to Iran about the United States' improper activities in a country with an important strategic position in the Middle East. The State Department denied the Soviet claim. The report was signed by Congressmen Bolton (Republican) and Millo, who traveled to the Middle East last summer. The report stated, "In terms of American interests and security, we should seriously consider the issue of Iranian military buildup, so that the country can actually obtain the same status as Greece and Turkey." Under the so-called Truman Doctrine, the United States gave Greece $300 million and Turkey $100 million last year. Greece was able to use $173 million for its military, while the aid to Turkey was entirely military in nature. The United States has stationed military missions in both Turkey and Greece to help them build up their strength as anti-communist fortresses. According to the State Department, Iran has not yet requested such assistance, so there is currently no consideration being given.

### General Eisenhower Relinquishes Military Position, Will Write Memoirs

To Provide for Family Living Expenses

[United Press, Washington, 7th] Eisenhower, who relinquished his position as US Army Chief of Staff on the 7th, stated that he has abandoned his fishing vacation and will begin writing his memoirs immediately. At a farewell press conference at the Pentagon, he stated that he plans to use the time before assuming the presidency of Columbia University on June 7th to write his memoirs, so that his family's living expenses can be covered. General Bradley will succeed him as Chief of Staff, and he offered three suggestions: (1) The salaries of soldiers in Korea and remote islands in the Pacific should be increased, otherwise it will affect the recruitment of new soldiers. The army is already 100,000 men short of the legal limit, and this reduction will continue; (2) The Women's Auxiliary Corps is scheduled to end completely on June 30th, and Congress should urgently pass a bill to keep it in existence, otherwise the future of the army will be in grave danger; (3) The treatment of officers from Lieutenant to Colonel should be improved. Regarding his memoirs, Eisenhower stated: He intends to write things that his conscience allows, otherwise there is no need to publish them. This is the only opportunity in his life to think about his family. People in the military, whether enlisting or retiring, are all impoverished.

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] General Eisenhower today handed over his position as Chief of Staff to General Bradley. President Truman, cabinet members, senior generals, and British Army Chief of Staff General Morgan were all present at the ceremony. General Eisenhower has dedicated 33 years to the military. After retiring, he will have a two-month vacation to contemplate the outline of his memoirs.

### Reasons for the Decline in US Prices: Grain Prices Fall, Department Stores Reduce Prices; Currency Fluctuations in Various Countries Also Have an Impact

[Central News Agency, New York, 7th] Various countries are paying close attention to the trend of US prices. Therefore, the point of attention everywhere is "whether the recent sudden drop in US prices and stocks is a harbinger of the collapse of the American economy." It is still too early to make a definitive statement on the shadow of this matter, but most financial experts believe that this is a good adjustment in the US price struggle, and there is no sign of recession. Most businessmen believe that the drop in prices can produce a psychological force and prevent prices from rising again. There are indeed many economic reasons for the recent drop in US prices. From the supply side, food production in Europe, South America, and the United States has greatly improved. American farmers who hoarded grains in December last year due to tax issues are selling off their inventories for fear that prices will continue to fall. At the same time, the supply and demand in the commercial sector has gradually become balanced. From the demand side, it is believed that Congress will reduce aid to Europe, and the price of grains is higher than the price of meat, so the demand for livestock grains has decreased due to consumer resistance. Grain prices have also fallen due to the reduction in the price of livestock feed. The decline in prices has also been affected by the UK's automatic freeze on wages and profits plan, and the revision of currency values in the Soviet Union, Italy, and France. Some observers believe that the large fluctuations in prices are sufficient to indicate economically that inflation may have reached saturation. This downward trend is beneficial rather than dangerous to the United States. The high cost of living in the United States will fall as a result, making more American goods available to other countries. At the same time, if the reduction in the price of American goods is realized, then the unions will not be able to claim that the cost of living is high and demand wage increases. The threat of a third strike in the United States due to demands for wage increases will be greatly reduced. A certain financial expert also believes that the United States' efforts to maximize production this year will greatly benefit the correction of inflation. The Vanguard Forum believes that the fall in the price of agricultural products will definitely cause the price of stocks to fall. All businessmen's actions are more or less influenced by tangible and intangible psychological shadows. The fall in the price of agricultural products will cause the price of retail food to fall, and the fall in the price of retail food will cause the price of industrial products to fall. From this point of view, the fall in the price of stocks and goods will be a regulatory effect, without causing disturbing shadows in the market.

### West German New Charter Takes Effect Today

German Parties Oppose East-West Split

[United Press, Frankfurt, 7th] West German parties stated on the 7th that the constitution of the limited autonomous government in the British-American occupied zones is just another action to permanently divide Germany. West German parties have abandoned their infighting and unanimously agreed that the charter given by the British and American occupying authorities is tantamount to sowing the seeds of a West German government, causing western Germany to be permanently divided. The United States and Britain gave the Germans a charter in their occupied zones on the 6th, allowing them to establish a limited autonomous government. This is the first step in restoring order to Germany after more than three years of chaos. The charter will take effect on Sunday.

### South Korean Situation Remains Serious: Organized Riots Cause Disturbances Throughout the Country; 150 Koreans Arrested

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 8th] The riots that occurred throughout South Korea yesterday seemed to have subsided this morning, but the US military and Korean police remain vigilant against new riots. Korean rioters and Korean police clashed fiercely yesterday. It is reported that 10 to 13 Koreans and 4 Korean policemen have died. Police reports state that another 7 policemen and 3 rioters were injured, and 2 policemen were kidnapped by rioters. The police have arrested 150 Koreans and are interrogating them. It is claimed that there were a total of 105 incidents throughout South Korea yesterday, including riots, destructive actions, demonstrations, and strikes. They appear to be extremely well-organized riots. The most severely disturbed areas were the port of Busan and Daegu. It is claimed that the South Korean Labor Party (the successor to the Communist Party) is quite strong in these two places. As a result of the destructive actions, between approximately 50 and 61 locomotives were damaged because parts were removed. Telephone lines and transportation routes have been cut off in many places. Seoul was relatively quiet yesterday. The "Dong-A Ilbo," a right-wing newspaper, was attacked by rioters, but suffered only minor damage. An American sentry here was pelted with stones by Koreans last night, but the sentry fired a shot into the air and dispersed the rioters. Pyongyang Broadcasting Station, controlled by the Soviets, took advantage of the unrest in South Korea and broadcast last night that all the people of South Korea have risen up to protest against the United Nations delegation to Korea.

Autumn is the Most Dangerous Season in Europe

President Roosevelt agreed to convene the leaders of both parties in the Senate at the White House on the evening of July 18, 1939. At this meeting, the President and I planned to make a final appeal in support of the bill to abolish the arms embargo in the Neutrality Act—Editor, News Service. If this appeal failed, we would hold the opposition responsible for the events that would occur after the bill's failure to pass. The President and I both felt that we had to make one last and greatest attempt to make the Senate leaders fully aware of how serious the danger would be to our country's future if war broke out in Europe. When the meeting began in the President's study upstairs, the atmosphere seemed quite harmonious on the surface, but the inner emotions were tense. Among those present were Vice President Garner, Majority Leader Barkley, Pittman, Minority Leader McNary, Minority Whip Austin, and William E. Borah, a minority member of the Foreign Relations Committee.

The President began the discussion by first mentioning Senator Nye's extreme isolationist views, explaining that these views were hindering the passage of our measures in the Senate. Borah interrupted the President rather quickly, waved his hands, and said, "There are others, Mr. President." The President, somewhat surprised, turned and asked, "What are you saying, Senator Borah?" Then Borah repeated, "There are others, Mr. President." Subsequently, the President and Borah had a conversation during which Borah vehemently opposed the lifting of the arms embargo and tried to make his point that, at least in the near future, war would not occur.

Then the President turned to me and said, "Cordell, what do you think the chances are of danger ahead?"

I tried to restrain my emotions and earnestly replied, "If Senator Borah could see just a few of the extremely serious cables concerning the international situation that have been sent to the State Department, I would be satisfied if he revised his views."

Then Borah, in a forceful and absolutely unchangeable tone, said that he had sources of information from abroad, and based on his judgment, these sources satisfied him that war would not occur in Europe in the near future. He seemed to imply that this information was more reliable than what the State Department had received.

Recently, I have noticed that some things have been published that are said to be about Senator Borah's memorandum of this conversation. I do not want to discuss the exact wording of the conversation at that time, but I must state that Borah's words created a definite and unshakeable concept of the situation at that time in my mind, as I have just stated. President Roosevelt also indicated more than once that he had gained the same impression from Borah's words.

In my past experience, I have never found it so difficult to restrain my emotions, so difficult to avoid a spontaneous outburst of emotion. From the high stacks of official documents in the State Department, I knew that Borah was thoroughly wrong; we saw very realistically the imminent danger of the total outbreak of war, which might come before the end of summer—and I certainly said so. Borah's statement that he valued private news more than the State Department's news was a slander against our entire diplomatic effort.

After the other leaders of both parties unanimously expressed the view that the repeal of the embargo could not be passed by Congress, the President turned to me and asked, "Cordell, what do you think of the situation?" After Borah expressed his opinion of myself and the State Department, my emotions were on the verge of eruption. When I answered the President, the agitation in my emotions was largely not hidden. I said, "In the situation where Senator Borah casually dismisses all the facts of the State Department, I simply don't know what to think, and all the facts we have completely negate his theory that war will not happen." I was so deeply convinced that the danger was imminent and so indignant at the impudence of disregarding all the facts and considerations that it was simply impossible for me to continue speaking without losing my self-control. At midnight, when the meeting ended in this atmosphere, the White House issued two communiqués. The first stated that the unanimous opinion of the Democratic and Republican members present was that any action on neutrality could not be realized in this session of Congress, but that the matter could be considered in the next session of Congress. The other said: "The President and the Secretary of State maintain a firm position, believing that if the Senate cannot take action at present, then if a new crisis in Europe occurs between now and January next year, the leadership of the United States in using its potential to maintain peace in other countries will be weakened."

Only five weeks later, we had to use this power to make a final effort to prevent war in Europe. In Hitler's view, our power had undoubtedly been weakened by Congress's refusal to follow the government's leadership, and at the same time, he believed that Britain and France could not obtain weapons, ammunition, or aircraft from the United States, which was also a reason for our power being weakened.

As soon as the meeting ended, Senator Borah denied any intention of damaging my dignity or my official position in any way, and Senator McNary also followed him in expressing this. But it was impossible to apologize after damaging the dignity of the State Department I led. I received these deniers coldly. I admitted that Borah had the best intentions, but I was forced to say that he was so emotional that his thinking was unclear.

I had often invited Borah to the State Department so that I could show him the messages sent by our diplomatic missions in Europe and Asia and discuss the general situation abroad with him, but he had never condescended to do so. If he could have come to the State Department when discussing the neutrality issue, what could I have shown him? Among dozens of other reference materials, there were also these:

Our Chargé d'Affaires in Berlin, Kirk, telegraphed me on May 13, stating that although the diplomatic representatives of many other countries did not expect Germany to take immediate action against Poland, they were extremely pessimistic about the chances of avoiding conflict. The general impression among foreign military circles in Berlin was that Germany was militarily capable of taking action against Poland at any time. On June 24, Kirk reported that rumors about unusual troop movements and continuous military activities within Germany had created a general impression that Germany was preparing for some event.

On May 16, Ambassador Bullitt telegraphed from Paris that Daladier had expressed the opinion that peace might be able to survive June, but he was not optimistic in his overall view. A month later, Bullitt telegraphed that Foreign Minister Bonnet had told him that although Germany would not launch an aggression immediately, he was certain that there would be a major crisis before the end of the summer. On June 28, Bullitt telegraphed the opinion of the Polish Ambassador to France, that the possibility of war occurring between Poland and Germany in mid-August was 80%. On June 30, Bullitt telegraphed the belief of the French Foreign Ministry official Léger, that in mid-August a crisis of the most serious nature was unavoidable.

On May 31, Polish Ambassador Potocki told me that Hitler would be forced to take some step in some direction in the coming months. On June 26, Potocki informed me that his country was intensifying its war preparations to prevent Germany from launching a war. I expressed the opinion to him that the situation in Europe was not good. Ominous signs and situations were appearing more and more. Sooner or later—no one could say when—in a situation in Europe that was so highly coordinated on a war footing, extremely serious things were very likely to happen, unless something could be done at the same time to avoid them.

On June 27, Ambassador Kennedy telegraphed Halifax's views from London, stating that the situation in Germany was extremely volatile, and the chances of difficulties occurring before the end of next month were very high. On July 5, Kennedy telegraphed that Halifax had told him that Britain was gathering ships and naval personnel reserves, ostensibly to prepare for exercises in August, but actually to prepare the navy a month before difficulties arose, at which time it was assumed that difficulties would occur in September. On June 3, our Chargé d'Affaires in The Hague reported the opinion of Admiral Versteegh, Chief of Staff of the Dutch Navy, that Hitler might engage in war between mid-August and the end of the month, after completing the harvest. Versteegh also mentioned that the German side was harvesting crops as quickly as possible, which had been noted by the Dutch side. In addition, we constantly received reports from our foreign diplomatic missions on European developments, stating that Germany was continuing to exert pressure on Poland and was making various gestures to seize Danzig, while also explaining the various difficulties in immediately concluding an Anglo-Soviet agreement, although British diplomacy had been working towards this goal for several years. All this information, Borah and his colleagues could have seen, if they wanted to. But Borah preferred to rely on a minor news agency in London; as it later came to be known. This was the last vigorous struggle of the powerful isolationist movement in the United States, continuing to fight by all possible means while still in a crisis. But after the war broke out in Europe, it could no longer hinder any proposal of the government. No one can say for certain whether our failure to repeal the arms embargo was a final, or even an important, factor in Hitler's final decision to go to war. But I am convinced that if the arms embargo could have been lifted in May, June, or even July of 1939, he would certainly have taken this factor into account. I also believe that our failure to repeal the embargo encouraged him to move forward, and furthermore, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's assurance that Britain and France could not truly help Poland, and even if they did, they could not be very effective because the United States could not give it material assistance, was also a stimulus to Hitler. On July 20, Bullitt telegraphed the President from Paris, stating that opinions in London and Paris both believed that Hitler's decision to launch a war in August had increased due to Congress's delay in taking action on the Neutrality Act, and British Deputy Foreign Secretary Vansittart believed that war would occur in August, betting on it two to one.

### Homebound Passengers Line Up to Buy Train Tickets; Long Snake Turns into a Coiled Dragon; North Railway Station is Jam-Packed; Regularly Maintains a Record of 100,000 People; Railway Police and Military Police Serve All Night; Taking Advantage and Cheating is Unpreventable

[Reported by this newspaper] The lunar New Year is so deeply rooted in the lives and customs of the Chinese people that it seems it can never be abolished. Travelers living in Shanghai need to return home to spend the New Year and have a precious reunion with their families. The two railway bureaus have prepared early based on past experience, such as adding homebound trains on both lines and adding carriages to the original passenger trains, but they still cannot cope with the crowded passengers. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, more than 100,000 tickets for various stations on the two lines were sold at the North Railway Station, more than 40% more than the normal number of passengers. Especially after 8:00 PM every day, the North Railway Station is always jam-packed with homebound passengers. A large third and fourth-class waiting room cannot accommodate the shoulder-to-shoulder passengers. Later arrivals have to queue at the door. Because the single-person queue is too long, passengers naturally change the single long snake formation into a folded coiled dragon formation, and the large courtyard is also crowded to the brim. It takes at least 20 minutes to walk the short dozens of yards from the gate to the ticket office. According to informal estimates, from 7:00 PM to 1:00 AM yesterday and the day before yesterday, the entire North Railway Station regularly maintained a record of 100,000 people, including those sending off passengers, buying tickets, and boarding the train.

Passengers who could not buy tickets came up with a clever idea and rushed to window number 4 to buy platform tickets and mixed into the carriages, preparing to buy tickets later. As a result, the number of freeloading passengers on each train greatly exceeded the original quota. Although the sale of platform tickets was immediately stopped, there were still many who took advantage of the moment when the railway police at the ticket gate shifted their gaze and jumped over the iron fence and slipped onto the platform. There were too many people, and it was really impossible to prevent them.

The number of soldiers hitching a ride also increased significantly, and the joint office of military police was naturally more difficult to deal with. The night before last, an officer surnamed Kong took his wife and children to Zhenjiang. He went to the joint office to ask for half-price tickets. His son was lost in the crowd, and his wife was crying anxiously. She reported it to the police section. Fortunately, the railway police helped him find his son, but when he turned around, he couldn't find his wife. He was so anxious that he jumped up and down, shouting and clamoring to the stationmaster for his wife. A nun wearing a large monk's robe also came to buy a ticket. She squeezed back and forth in the crowd, sweating profusely. The front of her robe was suddenly torn in half by a strong passenger. She wanted to grab him to negotiate, but he had already disappeared. She had to admit that she was unlucky.

Many passengers who did not want to squeeze planned to go back in the first few days of the New Year. Therefore, the Railway Bureau originally planned to reduce the number of trains from the first day of the lunar New Year to allow the hard-working engine personnel to take turns resting for one or two days. This plan may have to be changed because of this.

The information desk was particularly busy. Miss Shi Keming, who was on the night shift these days, constantly answered various questions for passengers, and her throat was hoarse. Director Chen Bochang and Deputy Director and Transportation Department Director Xie Zhen personally inspected the station the night before last. Seeing this situation, they decided to temporarily add irregular passenger trains and mobilize all trains to carry the remaining passengers on the two lines. At 12:30 AM, 2:00 AM, 6:00 AM, and 1:00 AM yesterday, additional special trains were added to Wuxi, Changzhou, Nanjing, and Hangzhou, but the maximum carrying capacity of each train was only 2,500 people, because the luggage of the homebound passengers was very heavy, which affected the load of the train. For the sake of safety, passengers were absolutely forbidden to climb on the roof of the train. The railway police of the police department and the stationed military police also served all night.

### New Operetta: Intricate Plot, Altering Numbers on Checks, An Yu Zhuang Cheated Out of Huge Sum

[Reported by this newspaper] Recently, a new operetta case of altering checks and being cheated out of 160 million yuan has been discovered in the city. The details are quite intricate. Recently, Dafa Food Company collected a sum from Maochang Stock Company, the amount being 1.65 million yuan. Maochang immediately issued a six-day check from An Yu Qian Zhuang and paid it in full. After Xu Jiyan, a collector from Dafa Company, took the check, he happened to meet a man wearing a velvet robe next to the escalator of the building. The man claimed that he had cash and was willing to exchange the check. Xu did not suspect anything and counted the money in person, and there was no shortage. After the exchange, the man left.

When An Yu Qian Zhuang was settling accounts yesterday, it was discovered that Maochang's account was overdrawn too much. After inquiring, it was discovered that the 1.65 million yuan paid on the sixth had turned into 160 million. They reported it to the Huangpu Police Sub-Bureau. After summoning the staff of Dafa Company, they learned the details of the exchange of notes at that time. When the original ticket was re-examined, it was found that the reader had wiped the ticket with "color fading spirit" and then rewrote the huge number with a black pen. The money house was negligent for a while, and was cheated. The case is currently being investigated by the bureau.

In the future, the Special Criminal Court, the Ordinary Criminal Court, and the Civil Court will all hold court hearings there. The current Tilanqiao Special Criminal Court will be converted into staff dormitories of the High Court.

### Traitor Ink Dancers: Seeking Narration for a Moment with Fine Words and Regular Script

[Reported by this newspaper] Among the traitor criminals, there are several who like to write and dance with ink. Each time they ask the warden for a special meeting, they present reports in meticulous small regular script with gorgeous words. Because their writing is both affectionate and literary, they often get the warden's approval. For example, the recent report by the former puppet ambassador to Japan, Cai Peizhi, was written in the style of the Lingfei Sutra, and the text was in parallel prose. For example, one section: "In my declining years, I am imprisoned, feeling like a swaying candle in the wind. My family is scattered and homeless, thinking about how they will live. Just this moment of narration is enough to comfort my sorrowful feelings."

### Renaming of the Air Transport Brigade; Executive Yuan Approval Pending

[Report from our newspaper] The former Air Transport Brigade led by Flying Tiger General Chennault, is currently temporarily called the Civil Aviation Transport Brigade.

However, the new name is still awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan. Once approved, the new name will be adopted. The team has been established for one year, averaging 4 million pounds of materials transported per month. Our government has approved the team to use a total of 19 aircraft, but only 18 are frequently used, and the average number of aircraft flying daily is only 12. Therefore, the materials currently transported are all urgently needed in various regions. The Air Transport Brigade's flight operations are currently busy with transportation to and from Beiping. The team has a one-year contract with the government. According to the person in charge, they will continue to work hard on the transportation of relief materials to assist China's needs.

### Pre-Marital Health Checkups; Hope to Promote and Encourage

In order to promote eugenics, improve the race, and prevent hereditary diseases, the Health Bureau has decided to promote pre-marital health checkups. It has already notified the municipal hospitals and district health clinics to provide free physical examinations to young men and women who request them before marriage and issue beautifully printed health certificates.

### Government Reform is Determined; Deeply Hope for Strengthened Sino-American Cooperation; Zhang Jia'ao Speaks at the Annual Meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in the United States

The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai held its 29th annual meeting the night before last. Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank, was invited to attend and deliver a speech, which lasted for 30 minutes. Zhang first analyzed the social and economic environment of our country, explaining that as long as we seize the opportunity, use it for the benefit of the people, and add the assistance of friendly countries, we can smoothly complete the reform plan. Finally, he addressed the American businessmen in China, deeply hoping that we can cooperate effectively with each other. The text of Zhang's speech is published below:

From this annual meeting, we recall the achievements of your Chamber of Commerce in the past 29 years for this city and our country, which have been significant. Your enterprising spirit and dedication to business make me deeply believe that we will have more important assistance on the path of working together for national construction. History is formed by the accumulation of human wisdom and struggle. Due to the modern ideas and spirit of peaceful competition you have brought, good results have been produced in China. However, the evolution of history is not as smooth as we would like. Twists and turns are inevitable. Even if there are setbacks, we must not doubt the victory of progress and truth. Since China has had a history, dynasties have changed every few hundred years, and internal unrest has occurred every few decades. After a destruction, the larger one takes one or two decades, and the smaller one takes four or five years, and then gradually recovers. Because the rural society of unorganized individualism, on the one hand, does not have the means of concentrated production to destroy it, on the other hand, everyone can exert their full energy, and on the third hand, the region is vast, and transportation is inconvenient, so the destruction of the war is only limited to one part, and on the fourth hand, the standard of living is low, and the people are brave enough to endure hardship. In this Second World War, China received assistance from the Allied countries, especially the various sacrifices of the United States. Fortunately, with minimal preparation, it achieved victory. In fact, the above factors are still important reasons for winning the war. I deeply believe that although we are encountering extremely serious difficulties today, the active recovery power of the Chinese people and the passive resistance power of natural conditions are sufficient to prevent the overall collapse and shorten the recovery time. If we have the courage to overcome this short-term obstacle, it will not be a problem. However, the seriousness of the situation today cannot be ignored. After eight years of resistance against Japan, China has experienced internal unrest, resulting in unprecedented inflation, which has been imposed on the people and created the current military force of civil war, which is world-class and more thoroughly destructive. It not only wants to thoroughly destroy all existing means of production and transportation, but also wants to destroy all personal freedom and spontaneity, and use propaganda with persuasive power to destroy China's old social organizations and traditional concepts, that is, to destroy the free recovery power of the Chinese people and the resistance power of natural conditions, making inflation unstoppable and making recovery more difficult. In this situation, in order to increase its own resistance and shorten the post-war recovery time, it has to rely on external assistance. Whether it is a country, society, or individual, it cannot make progress without a strong enemy. Today's communist threat is giving the National Government and the general public great stimulation. In the past, military and political organs and the public did not pay attention to organization or efficiency. Now, it is necessary to improve efficiency and be thoroughly honest. In the past, the concept of valuing cities and neglecting villages must now be changed to building villages and raising the living standards of farmers. In the past, the general upper class emphasized material enjoyment, and in the future, it is necessary to talk about equal enjoyment. In the past, the undisciplined actions of the army hindered politics and despised the people. In the future, it is necessary to coordinate the military and the government and integrate the military and the people. If the National Government can be healthy, so that the communist side knows that the Chinese people cannot be defeated by force, then the Communist Party will have a day to abandon the military. Because no matter what country, society, or individual, it cannot increase the speed of progress without advanced people working side by side, learning from each other, and observing. Today, the prerequisite for American aid is the self-help of the aided country, which is the greatest driving force for promoting the progress of backward countries. The Chinese people have always emphasized individualism. Since the Anti-Japanese War, they have fought alongside the great powers and have received deep assistance from the Allied countries. At the national level, they feel more enthusiastic about international cooperation. At the people's level, due to the spread of American soldiers in the Anti-Japanese War, the relationship between people has become closer, but this is only emotional and has not yet reached the level of practical work cooperation. If American aid is successful, it can take this opportunity to increase the degree of cooperation in practical work, so that the government can quickly reform and the entire people can get the opportunity for real cooperation in practical work. Therefore, I believe that the difficulties China is encountering today and the sacrifices the United States will bear can give the greatest help to China's reform and reconstruction in the next few decades. The success or failure of everything depends on how we seize this opportunity and use it. President Zhang announced ten points of internal affairs reform for the purpose of coordinating the effectiveness of American aid, and has notified the US government. These ten points include: (1) Manage and regulate government expenditures. (2) Improve the tax system and its administration. (3) Improve the treatment of civil servants, officers and soldiers, and improve work efficiency. (4) Control the supply of daily necessities, prevent speculation, and manipulate prices. (5) Do our best to establish a base fee that will stabilize the currency system. (6) Improve the banking and credit system. (7) Promote exports. (8) Improve the control of imported goods. (9) Improve the land system and develop agricultural production. (10) Restore transportation and important industries and mines. The importance of these ten plans is self-evident. I deeply hope that concrete measures will be implemented one by one. I dare to believe that the government has a determination because it knows that the government has prepared a detailed implementation plan for each principle. The most basic of the ten plans is to reduce the budget balance. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the revenue and expenditure of the Chinese treasury have always been more than 50%. It was reduced to 30% before the Anti-Japanese War and is now 70%. It is hoped that with the efforts of President Zhang and Minister Yu, the revenue and expenditure gap can be reduced as much as possible. However, under the current situation, it is not easy to reduce the revenue and expenditure gap. We must strictly manage military expenditures and other expenditures, and at the same time improve tax administration and its system. However, there are still many difficulties we face in stopping inflation. According to the budget announced in the first half of this year, the remaining revenue and expenditure gap is about 50%. I not only hope that the budget for the first half of the year will not be added, but also hope that with American aid and domestic reform, the budget gap for the second half of the year will be reduced even more. There is one thing I can tell you, that is, some of the government's plans have been implemented. For example, in order to avoid credit expansion, national banks have implemented tight lending to prevent funds from flowing into hoarding and speculation, and financial management bureaus have been established in major cities to prevent funds from flowing into speculation and manipulating the black market. Shanghai is also piloting the rationing of food, cooking oil, fuel, and sugar in order to gradually promote it in other cities. Recently, it is also planning to fully ration food in five major cities in order to distribute it fairly, and revising the management methods of cotton yarn, supplying cotton by the government and adopting a substitution spinning and weaving method to prevent prices from soaring. The policies on import and export trade and foreign exchange management have been revised. Thanks to the efforts of Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, nearly 70 million US dollars of export foreign exchange has been received in five and a half months. At the same time, thanks to the efforts of Li Ming, Vice Chairman of the Import and Export Management Committee, great achievements have been made in trade management. Now that the association is under the leadership of Huo Baoshu, it should be able to see more progress. At the same time, due to the cooperation of the Hong Kong government, the signing of the customs agreement and the implementation of part of the financial agreement, smuggling can be reduced in the future. However, all controls in China are still in the initial stage and lack experienced talents, so it is difficult to expect them to be as ideal as possible. Due to the limited supply of foreign exchange, it cannot satisfy the hopes of importers and manufacturers. At the same time, because the foreign exchange black market cannot be eliminated, and domestic prices are soaring, the wishes of exporters cannot be satisfied. Looking around at the current domestic situation, of course it is not completely satisfactory. We must make greater efforts to improve it. Some difficulties can be overcome immediately, and some must be fundamentally resolved. The former, such as the restriction of credit lending, must be coordinated with the production plan so that necessary industries can still obtain the funds they need, and at the same time, the obstacles caused by the military's involvement in transportation must be removed. The latter, such as the management of foreign exchange and trade, must wait until the currency system is stable before it can return to normal. For example, in the allocation of import quotas, the import of raw materials and machinery must be coordinated with domestic production. As for the management of major materials such as cotton yarn and cotton cloth, it must not hinder the development of private enterprises in the control. To sum up the above points, they are all urgent tasks that should be carried out now. There is one more thing, the merchants and industrialists of various friendly countries who are operating in China always feel that the Chinese government has repeatedly declared that it welcomes foreign investment, but it is often just lip service. In fact, the government is sincere, but because of insufficient foreign exchange, on the one hand, the supply of foreign exchange for the raw materials and machinery needed by foreign-funded factories is insufficient, so that the factories cannot develop as ideal. On the other hand, the profits earned in China cannot be remitted back to their home countries, so investors are hesitant to move forward. Third, importers with a long history and excellent service cannot get enough quotas, and sometimes they cannot help but be inferior. The first point is to decide the amount of materials and parts to be applied based on the factory's production plan. The second point is to hope that when American aid is successful and there is more foreign exchange, appropriate measures will be formulated to solve it. The third point is that if imported raw materials and machinery are distributed according to the production plan, those with better service conditions will naturally be able to get more transactions. I hope that we can gradually achieve various improvement goals. I hope that when you use American aid in China, there are many technical aspects that still depend on American assistance. However, China and the United States have different national conditions and educational backgrounds. How to make American methods applicable and effective in China must rely on American friends who have lived in China for a long time and have experience in Chinese affairs to do their best to assist and contribute opinions. If there are unavoidable difficulties, I hope those who are familiar with the Chinese situation will explain them well. Finally, I cannot help but mention one point to you, that is, defeatism must be eliminated. During the Second World War, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom all had several times when it seemed that they were already hopeless, but because they held on to the spirit of victory, they achieved the final victory. The difficulties we are encountering today are similar to those of the war era. Why do Chinese and foreigners have defeatism? Moreover, today we are fighting a world revolution. The United States is now shouldering the world's responsibility. Every country must sincerely contribute its capabilities, so that the purpose of American aid to various countries can be achieved. I hope that the people of China and the United States will have greater courage to shoulder a common responsibility, and I wish you all good health.

Speaker and his wife inspect the cold shelters and talk with refugees (photographed by this newspaper)

### Speaker and His Wife Care About Fellow Citizens in Distress; Inspect the Facilities of Two Cold Shelters; Refugees Claim They Are Not Full Due to the Lack of Distension of Broken Rice; Poor People Beg to Be Released After Being Mistakenly Admitted

[Report from our newspaper] Mr. Po, the Speaker of the Municipal Council, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Tang Guanyu, and Chief Secretary Chang Quan, went to the Refugee Third Cold Shelter on Jungong Road and the Labor Relief Second Cold Shelter on West Tiyu Road yesterday afternoon to inspect the living conditions of the refugees. First, they visited the women and children's group in the Third Cold Shelter. They saw a large group of old and weak women, dressed in tattered clothes, who pulled the Speaker and his wife and other visitors, crying and complaining. They were mostly refugees from northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui, and claimed that "we only eat two bowls of rice a day, which is really not enough." The house they lived in was filthy and they slept on the ground, with only a few straws on the mattress. Some women even surrounded Mrs. Pan and said, "There is no water to drink, and no water to wash our faces." Another person said: "Yesterday, some people came to give out large cakes, and each person ate five, and some people also sent raisins." Mrs. Pan was very concerned about the lives of the refugees, asked in detail one by one, and promised to cook some vegetables immediately and send them to everyone, and discussed with the Speaker to raise more donations of daily necessities such as towels from all walks of life and distribute them to the refugees. Only the refugees Many refugees were not refugees at all, but were mistakenly pulled in. A woman with a local accent not only took out her national identity card, but also her voting certificate. She was a cigarette roller on the street, but was dragged into the cold shelter. Her husband is a small foreman and does not know that his wife is in the cold shelter. The cold shelter also does not allow refugees to go out. The illiterate and ignorant woman has no one to write a letter for her, so she can only sob. There are also two boys and girls, about ten years old, who sell tea for a living at the North Railway Station, and were also arrested. Both children have parents and have been in the shelter for nine days, but their parents still do not know where they have gone. The children also told their home address, begging the reporters to notify their family members.

Thinking of the Elderly Mother-in-Law at Home, Begging to Be Released

There was also a middle-aged woman whose clothing was not like that of a refugee. She was wearing a long cheongsam. She came to Shanghai from Zhenjiang to visit relatives, but was also mistakenly arrested. She had an 86-year-old mother-in-law and a 6-year-old posthumous child at home. She cried bitterly, saying: "Tomorrow is New Year's Eve, how can they old and young spend the New Year?" She knelt down to Chief Secretary Xiang in Changchang, begging to be released so that she could catch a car back to Zhenjiang that night. The sight was really sad. The names and addresses of the above-mentioned people whose families were mistakenly sent to the cold shelter were recorded by Chief Secretary Xiang and forwarded to the administrator for immediate investigation and release.

Limited to One Catty of Rice Per Person, Why Only Half a Catty Is Received

The Speaker then visited the dining room and the men's section. Although they did not cry like women, they also complained that "we can't get enough to eat." The Speaker immediately asked the deputy director of the shelter, Chen Wenyi, and the management staff, saying that everyone is limited to one catty of rice per day, and children also have eleven taels. Why do the refugees say that they only get half a catty of rice? He also said: the management must be improved, divided into groups and buckets, and distributed in order, so as to maintain order and prevent the strong from eating more and the weak from not being able to grab it. At the same time, drinking water is also very important, and refugees must not be without water to drink. If the funding is insufficient, you can apply for a discretionary increase.

It Is Questionable Whether the Authorities Issued Broken Rice

Later, the refugees showed the Speaker the raw rice. It turned out that this kind of rice was broken and as small as millet, only one-fifth or one-sixth of an ordinary grain of rice. It was not very expansive and was easily leaked in the sea. It is questionable whether this kind of broken rice was issued by the authorities. In addition, Mrs. Pan also said that she hoped that the management staff would issue a cotton coat as soon as they received it, instead of waiting until all of them were received before issuing them to the refugees. The number of refugees in the shelter is uncertain, and the numbers given by the people in charge are inconsistent. Some say more than 800, some say more than 700, and finally they say more than 600. In short, the impression given by the Third Cold Shelter is not good.

I Sincerely Hope That Restaurants and Taverns Can Provide Leftover Food and Gravy

The Speaker and others then went to the Second Labor Relief Cold Shelter. There were more than 200 refugees in the shelter, mostly from northern Anhui. The cotton coats and trousers were quite neat, and the houses were newly built mud houses with beds. The shelter was managed by Song Shiqiao, and the management was excellent. The Speaker and his wife praised and encouraged them on the spot. The work done by the refugees is to dredge the nearby Shajing Port, but the remuneration is very low, only 15,000 yuan is given for each earthwork mud. At the same time, because they are all young and strong workers, although they have 24 taels of rice a day, they still cannot get enough to eat because they do not get enough oil (the total monthly cost of firewood, oil, salt, and vegetables is only 80,000 yuan per person). Director Song sincerely hopes that restaurants and taverns can provide leftover food and gravy to help them adjust.

### Driver's Voluntary Act; Looking for Family Members

In order to sympathize with the refugees' hard work in the cold winter, the working hours were slightly reduced yesterday, and a day off was given on the first day of the Lunar New Year. In addition, they requested the authorities to issue 10,000 yuan to each person today to buy pork. At that time, they also showed the rice they had received to the Speaker, and they were all grains of white rice. The Speaker and his wife were very satisfied with the management of the shelter, and immediately instructed Chief Secretary Xiang to contact restaurants and taverns, asking them to donate leftovers every day, and personally donate money to the shelter within a few days to help the refugees buy vegetables.

Also, A Fang, a driver of this newspaper, saw the tea-selling boy wandering in the cold shelter yesterday, and specially drove to the railway station area after the visit to find the child's parents according to the address. There were indeed people. His father was a porter at the station and was out. The neighbors thanked him repeatedly and immediately told his father to go to the shelter to bail out his young son so that the family could be reunited. This spirit of righteousness is also commendable.

A Firm but Not Too Firm Diplomacy

While Congress was debating the Neutrality Act, the ominous developments in Northeastern Europe were drawing our attention. The situation was worrying. The Soviet Union was engaged in extensive actions to establish new strategic borders for itself along the Baltic Sea. It was clearly trying to strengthen its defenses against foreign countries. However, judging by the military situation at the time, its target could not be the Allied powers, because the strength of Germany made it impossible for them to approach the Baltic Sea. Stalin clearly still had Germany in mind, and did not trust Hitler's words in the non-aggression pact signed in August 1939 any more than the Allied powers did.

We could sympathize with the Soviet Union's efforts to protect itself against Germany, but we were worried that its actions would further escalate the conflict in Europe.

After signing the agreement with Germany, the Soviet Union seemed like a catfish lying in the mud, waiting for an opportunity. In late September and October, it was able to bring the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into its sphere of influence without using force. Through various forms of pressure, it induced them to cede several strategic bases and station 20,000 troops in each of the three countries. However, since Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania still nominally retained their governments and independence, we felt that there was no need to take diplomatic steps.

However, the same pressure did not work on Finland. This strong little country showed every sign of "fighting rather than giving in."

Our relationship with the Soviet Union was unfortunately complicated by the incident involving the American cargo ship "City of Flint." (This ship, carrying various goods bound for England, was intercepted by the German pocket battleship "Deutschland" on October 9, 1939, and taken to Tromsø in Norway, and later to Murmansk in the Soviet Union. The detention of the ship in Murmansk prompted the United States to issue a note based on the rules of naval warfare.)

Negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland were underway at the time of the "City of Flint" incident, but the situation was not good. The Soviet Union demanded changes to the border and the cession of island bases in the Gulf of Finland, which Finland believed would undermine its independence. The negotiations broke down on November 13, and relations between the two countries deteriorated rapidly. On the afternoon of November 28, Ambassador Bullitt telegraphed me from Paris, informing me that the Soviet Union had just renounced its non-aggression treaty with Finland and would attack Finland in the near future. He suggested that if our government could do something in this situation, it should do so as soon as possible.

I immediately took this news to the President, and we immediately decided that we were willing to mediate the dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union and to intervene if they were willing. So I sent a telegram to Moscow and Helsinki, in which I said that our government was extremely concerned about the increasing tension between Finland and the Soviet Union, and said: "If the scope of the war is further expanded, causing international relations to deteriorate, it would be extremely regrettable in our view. If both parties agree, our government is willing to intervene, and will not be involved in the dispute in any way, but will only be committed to a peaceful resolution of the dispute."

Finland welcomed our suggestion, but the Soviet Union felt that mediation was not possible. The next day, Stalin launched his attack on Finland, including the bombing of several cities.

We were extremely disappointed by the outbreak of another war. After discussing the matter with the President, he issued a strong statement to the press the day after the war broke out. He said: "The people of all peace-loving countries, who still hope to maintain international relations based on the rule of law throughout the world, will unanimously condemn this new act of using force to resolve international disputes." He also appealed to Finland and the Soviet Union to avoid bombing civilians.

Steinhardt telegraphed me from Moscow, saying that when he presented this appeal to Foreign Minister Molotov, Molotov absolutely denied that the Soviet air force had ever bombed civilians or undefended cities, or had any intention of doing so. (Our embassy in Helsinki had sent us many telegrams listing many facts of Soviet bombing of undefended cities.) Steinhardt said that he got the impression from his conversation with Molotov that the Soviet Foreign Minister did not want a third party to mediate, and that the Soviet Union's purpose in starting the war was to quickly resolve the Finnish problem, so that it could freely deal with developments in the Balkans and the Black Sea region, or from Germany.

At that time, we decided to implement a moral embargo against the Soviet Union, prohibiting the export of aircraft to the Soviet Union, a measure that had already been implemented against Japan.

The President and I had decided long ago not to apply the Neutrality Act to the Soviet-Finnish War. In the government's position, we could not sell arms to Finland, but we did not want to prevent private exporters from selling arms, if they wished to do so. Furthermore, due to the war in Europe, our ships were already prohibited from entering the Baltic Sea due to the declared war zone. Finally, we still tried to avoid making the Soviet Union a belligerent in the legal sense. We deeply felt that the fundamental animosity between communist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany was so deep, and Hitler's ambitions were so boundless, that the Soviet Union might eventually come to the side of the Allied powers. We must proceed with caution and not force it to go in the other direction.

Our own unpleasant relationship with the Soviet Union can be seen in an incident that occurred in early December. Since we established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1933, our consular officials there had been subject to all kinds of restrictions, which our country would never have thought of applying to similar foreign officials. Their movements were restricted, they were constantly monitored, and their luggage was always inspected upon arrival or departure.

Finally, I decided to try applying the same treatment in our country, to see if this would be more effective than diplomatic protests in drawing the Soviet Union's attention to its lack of courtesy. When the Soviet Foreign Ministry applied for a "free passage certificate" (allowing the holder to be exempt from customs inspection) for a new vice-consul coming to New York, Ambassador Steinhardt in Moscow replied that we would be happy to do so if the Soviet government could issue similar documents to American consular officials coming and going. The Soviet Union refused. So Steinhardt suggested that when the Soviet vice-consul arrived in New York, his luggage should be inspected by customs officials.

This was done. So, on December 7, Ambassador Oumansky telephoned Assistant Secretary of State Messersmith to lodge a strong protest. We immediately informed him that the vice-consul's luggage was inspected because the luggage of American consuls coming and going to the Soviet Union was also inspected, and that we had always applied the principle of reciprocity.

Oumansky argued that this issue should be handled according to the most-favored-nation principle. That is, the Soviet Union would treat our consuls as it treated the consuls of any other country; and we should treat Soviet consuls as we treated the consuls of any other country.

But we informed the ambassador that our government had handled such matters for many years according to the principle of reciprocity, meaning that we would treat Soviet consuls as 　you treated our consuls.

Oumansky then asked us to confirm whether his government was accustomed to inspecting the luggage of our consuls going to the Soviet Union. Ambassador Steinhardt complied with his request and sent a series of examples.

Since the President was interested in this matter, I sent him a memorandum prepared by Messersmith. On December 22, the President replied in a memorandum:

"The memorandum you sent me on December 16 concerning the restrictions imposed by the Soviet Union on American diplomats is excellent. I think we should respond to every trouble caused by the Soviet Union with similar trouble.

"But when it comes to the reckless actions of more Dalin, Kalinin, or Molotov, we here cannot respond with the same reckless actions. But I think that day will come soon, that is to say, we may as well directly draw Oumansky's attention to the situation. We can tell him a little bit, that his government's failure to answer my telegram about the bombing of civilians, and the failure to allow our ambassador to communicate with the "City of Flint," are quite disregardful of the ordinary courtesy and friendly relations between civilized governments, so the President is frankly surprised and doubts whether the Soviet government considers it worthwhile to continue diplomatic relations. We stop here and do not go any further, but this is enough to make the Soviet government feel a burden."

We conveyed this meaning to the Soviets, but the Soviet officials' centuries-old inherited suspicion of foreigners remained unchanged.

A minor trouble from the Soviet side continued to give the President a headache. Steinhardt sent a telegram, informing us that the Moscow embassy would no longer be able to make long-distance calls unless they went to the central telephone office in person. After I sent this telegram to the President, he wrote me this memorandum on January 10, 1940:

"I am wondering if we can apply the same rules to the Soviet embassy here — or at least tell Oumansky that we want to do this. This can also be said to be human nature! FDR"

But later Steinhardt sent another phone call, saying that this difficulty had been resolved.

Although we never hesitated to speak frankly to the Soviet Union when necessary, I established a basic policy of maintaining good relations with the Soviet Union as much as possible, and never giving it the slightest impression that we were a current or potential enemy. The door to friendship was always open, and at least I was willing to get along with the Soviet Union in a compromise way.

### Jiangyin Discovery: A Case Within a Case. Wu Qian Gui and Other Masterminds: Murder for Money

[Our Jiangyin Correspondent, 6th of the Month] Wang Songren, a resident of Huanghezui Village, Qingyang Tongqi Township, was murdered in the river in front of the Pujiayu Rice Milling Machine Boat on the night of the 18th day of the 12th lunar month. After an autopsy by the local prosecutor's office, the Criminal Police Team braved the snow on the 4th of the month and went to the countryside to investigate the clues of the case. They brought the suspects Wang Quanfang, Yao Binggen, Wu Rensong, Wang Quanbao, Cao Gu's wife and others to the city, and also uncovered a murder case from six years ago. Cao Gu's wife's husband, Cao Zaizhang, made a living by boating. Six years ago, he helped his clansman fight with his clansman's younger brother Cao Baosheng for the inherited property. He was actually bribed by Shi Sheng with money to hire Wang Quanfang and Wu Qian Gui (who is still at large) to tie up Cao Zaizhang and kill him in Jiaoxi. At that time, Cao Gu's wife was forced by the power and did not dare to speak out. Last spring, Cao Baosheng inadvertently said that he did not kill the father and son (referring to Cao Zaizhang and his son Cao Guisheng) at the same time, and now he is using this to buy people to frame them. His son is now working in Shanghai, and he returned home once the day before yesterday and went to Shanghai. Wang Quanfang also confessed that Cao Shisheng paid Wu Qian Gui to murder Cao Zaizhang. The death of Wang Songren this time was masterminded by Wu Qian Gui and committed by Yao Binggen, Wu Rensong and others, while Wang Quanbao, Wu Rensong and others all claimed that they did not know about it. The case is now being transferred to the court for investigation. The discovery of a case within a case is by no means without cause.

### Wuhu Chamber of Commerce Solicits Donations from Merchants and the Wealthy on Behalf of Government

[Our Wuhu Correspondent, 7th of the Month] The Chamber of Commerce has been soliciting donations from merchants and wealthy individuals on behalf of the Anhui Provincial Government to the tune of 15 billion. After careful consideration by the business community, it was agreed by the end of the year that 4 billion would be donated by various industries in four grades, and goods would be delivered to the banking group for mortgage and handed over to the Anhui Provincial Government. The remaining 11 billion will be paid in January. Also: the 15 billion loan guaranteed by the rice donation will also be determined by the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce in January according to the amount shared by each industry.

### Yu Bingjun's Unclear Explanation: Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders Arrest

[Our Changshu Correspondent, 7th of the Month] The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that Yu Bingjun, the former magistrate of this county, has not yet completed the handover procedures, and has decided to request the Executive Yuan to issue an arrest warrant in order to bring him to justice. A special telegram has been sent to the county government to investigate and report on the county magistrate's age, appearance, characteristics, and the dates of his tenure.

### Carpenter Unable to Borrow Money, Burns Down His Residence

[Our Kunshan Correspondent, 7th of the Month] Jin Jiangjin, a resident of Dongtai籍 from Xiangguanjing Village, Jinji Township, works as a carpenter. His family is poor, and business is bad. On the evening of the 6th, because there was no rice to cook, he borrowed money from his neighbors, but was unable to borrow any. The couple cried to each other in their ragged clothes. He had a temporary nervous breakdown, and set fire to his small house. Although neighbors put out the fire, most of it had been burned down.

### Double-Cropping Rice Trial Planting Imminent

[Our Taixian Correspondent, 6th of the Month] The Private Lixiahe Double-Cropping Rice Cultivation System Experimental Station in this county has been organized and established by the local Yang Lian. It is preparing to start the experiment within this year. It is expected that if the experiment is successful, then the Lixiahe area, including Yan (cheng), Fu (ning), Dong (tai), Xing (hua), Gao (you), Bao (ying), and Huai (an), will be able to harvest two crops of rice a year, increasing the food supply by 15 million dan.

### Guangzhou Flower Market Thriving

[Our Guangzhou Correspondent, 8th of the Month] On the night before New Year's Eve, the flower market here was thriving. The flower market is on Jianglan Road, where hundreds of flowers are displayed side by side, competing for beauty. Tourists gathered to appreciate them, but there were few buyers. The most precious thousand-layered peach blossoms cost as much as 150 million yuan per plant, and the lowest price was more than 100,000 yuan. However, there were quite a few people who spent tens of millions of yuan to buy a flower.

### Dredging the Suzhou Creek

[Report from our newspaper] People living in Shanghai all know that there is a Suzhou Creek here, running east-west and connected to the Huangpu River. It is one of Shanghai's three major trunk rivers, and the largest part of the people's food—such as rice, oil, meat...all comes through this Suzhou Creek.

A few days ago, this city broke the record of the coldest climate in the past five years, which also affected the Suzhou Creek, which froze over. Rice was frozen on the way and could not be transported, and rice prices soared as a result. Fortunately, the ice melted and navigation resumed the next day, and rice prices fell again. From this example, we can see the importance of the Suzhou Creek to Shanghai, which is just like the throat to human beings, closely related.

Will Shanghai's throat be clogged?

Shanghainese all know the importance of Suzhou Creek, but few people pay attention to this Shanghai throat, which has not been maintained for ten years and may soon have problems. Rivers need to be dredged regularly, but Suzhou Creek has not been dredged for ten years. Now the riverbed has gradually become narrow, especially during the low water season in winter, rice and grain ships have not been able to be imported on schedule. If this continues, the consequences will be disastrous. Can you imagine how terrible and fatal it would be for Shanghainese if one day the throat becomes blocked?

The municipal government has long been aware of this serious problem, but the reason why it has not been able to move forward in the two years since the recovery is that it has no funds and is unable to do so. According to current prices, the cost of excavating soil is about 120,000 yuan per cubic yard, and the total cost of dredging Suzhou Creek is more than 300 billion yuan. Such a large sum of money is being planned by the municipal government, and the central government cannot subsidize it, so the dredging project, although important, has to be postponed for the time being.

Pay the upgraded tax to be used for dredging

How was Suzhou Creek dredged ten years ago? How was the source of funding raised? – At that time, the British Municipal Council's Dredging Bureau was responsible for the dredging work, and all the funds came from the "Upgraded Tax." The so-called "Upgraded Tax" is that all coastal land, purchased for private ownership (such as building private docks, etc.), must pay taxes to the eight companies – which is called "Upgraded Tax." At that time, this tax revenue was quite considerable. The Dredging Bureau had an agreement with our government that the "Upgraded Tax" would be collected by the Dredging Bureau and used for dredging. From 1931 to 1965, the bureau dispatched five dredgers, working day and night, to complete the dredging project. The following year, the war broke out suddenly, and the project was shelved. After settlement, there were still more than 90,000 yuan left over after offsetting income and expenditure. No one knows how this money should be returned to our government.

The "Upgraded Tax" is used for dredging expenses and there is a surplus, so why doesn't the municipal government continue to use it? - The problem is that times have changed and the "Upgraded Tax" is no longer as abundant as it used to be. Originally, the places along the Huangpu River that could be upgraded have already been upgraded, and the upgraded tax has also been collected to the　end. Without funding, dredging cannot be started, but the Municipal Bureau of Public Works is still doing its best in the midst of all difficulties.

To thoroughly solve the problem, start with the trunk river

Since the recovery, the bureau has done two remedial projects: (1) Dredging river channels parallel to the Suzhou Creek to reduce its carrying capacity. The completed ones include Yunzaobang, Zoumatang, Puhuitang, and Caohejing. (2) Dredging important tributaries of the Suzhou Creek to divert ships and connect parallel river channels. The completed ones include Mudu Port and Taoshupu.

The Bureau of Public Works has indeed made its best efforts in the above projects. They used the flour from the Executive Headquarters last year to launch voluntary labor service, and this winter they used the winter relief work relief system, which has achieved remarkable results and has also solved some of the problems. However, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts is not a solution after all. To completely solve the problem, we must start with dredging the trunk river itself.

The Municipal Bureau of Public Works convened a meeting with the Public Utility Bureau and other bureaus in the summer to discuss solutions, and decided that from the river mouth upwards to the Hengyun Bridge on Maigen Road, dredgers would be dispatched by the Dredging Bureau to dredge. Ships, equipment, and manpower are the responsibility of the Dredging Bureau, and the materials and cable piles required are provided by the Bureau of Public Works. The Dredging Bureau accelerated the progress of the equipment remaining　after the project　began in July last year. In the past half a year, only 160,000 cubic yards of mud have been excavated, and the total amount of soil in the Suzhou Creek is 2.6 million cubic yards. At the current speed of the Dredging Bureau, it will take 25 years to complete the dredging!

Twenty-five years is too long. At a meeting last month, the Shanghai Port Affairs Committee further reviewed the matter and decided to submit a request to the central government to double the collection of dredging donations attached to the Jianghai Customs, that is, to increase the original 3% to 6%, which would increase the revenue by 120 billion yuan per year. In addition to being used for dredging the Huangpu River, it can fully supply the use of dredging the Suzhou Creek. Mayor Wu expressed his strong approval of the above method, and believed that the dredging project was as urgent as a shooting star, and sent a telegram urging the central government to approve it as soon as possible. Now the reply of approval has arrived at the municipal government a few days ago.

A huge project will start soon

Once the funding problem is solved, the remaining problem is how to enrich the equipment to strengthen the project rate. After repeated discussions by the Port Affairs Organizing Committee, it was decided that the Bureau of Public Works and the Dredging Bureau would cooperate in handling the matter. The Dredging Bureau currently has two dredgers, and plans to add two mud dredgers. The Bureau of Public Works has two dredgers, and decided to participate in the work, and plans to distribute four dredgers from the remaining materials of the Executive Headquarters. Under such close cooperation, about 20,000 cubic yards of mud can be excavated every month, and the entire project is expected to be completed within four years.

The municipal government hopes that the Dredging Bureau can allocate two-thirds of the dredging fund—that is, 80 billion—to be used as the dredging fund for Suzhou Creek. Then the accumulated donations for four years will be 320 billion, which is just enough to complete the entire dredging project. The municipal government believes that everything is very ideal. Moreover, after the start of the project, it will be necessary to hire more than 10,000 temporary workers for a long time to be responsible for building dams, pumping water, picking mud, transporting soil, etc., which is also a good opportunity for production for the hordes of refugees in Shanghai. Therefore, dredging the Suzhou Creek is really related to Shanghai's city appearance, people's livelihood, economy, and refugee relief work.

Now the Port Affairs Committee is discussing the start-up steps with the Dredging Bureau. If everything goes smoothly, after the director of the Dredging Bureau, Ding Guitang, returns from Hong Kong to make a final decision, this huge project can be started immediately.

I hope that the dredging can be carried out smoothly as soon as possible, so that the Suzhou Creek will always serve the people of Shanghai! (Our reporter Hong Xucai)

### Ministry of Finance Secretly Orders the Crackdown on Underground Banks in Wuxi

[Our Wuxi Correspondent, 7th of the Month] The Ministry of Finance previously received a secret report that there are no less than 100 underground banks in Wuxi at present. These banks have simple organizations, save a lot of expenses, and are not subject to government regulations. However, the amount of business they do is several times that of formal financial institutions, and formal banks are greatly affected. The ministry has repeatedly ordered strict crackdowns. After receiving the order, the county government believed that these merchants disregarded the law and continued to operate secretly, which was not the case. It specially ordered its subordinates to conduct strict investigations and crackdowns, and yesterday it sent a public letter to the County Council, asking for assistance to ensure that they were all brought to justice.

### Qin Shijing Escorted to Suzhou

[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 7th of the Month] Qin Shijing, the once-famous thief in Wuxi, was previously sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Criminal Court of the Xidi Court. Later, Qin refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Suzhou High Court. He was escorted to Suzhou on the 6th and will be publicly tried on the 25th.

### Pocket News

Jiaxing

[Our Dispatch] This year's new conscripts, upon the county magistrate's order to various townships, must be collected before February 10th. Currently, townships such as Xinfeng, Buyun, Zhulin, Xushan, Xinzhuang, Jingxiang, and Fengshi have successively sent batches of new recruits in recent days. Verification and acceptance procedures are currently underway. Furthermore, Lu, the commander of the Jiaxing Garrison District, along with the commander of the Second Brigade, has personally gone to the counties under their jurisdiction to oversee the conscription of new recruits.

Yuyao

[Our Dispatch] The Yannanyan Township Office in southern Yuyao convened a meeting of village chiefs at the top of Yan Mountain a few days ago to discuss strategies for this year's conscription. Subsequently, the first and second village chiefs were kidnapped by bandits on their way home. Their current condition is unknown.

Another report: At approximately 11 PM on the fourth, more than 20 bandits suddenly arrived at the home of Rong Weiqing, the deputy township head of Ban Hai Di in Langxia Township. Each bandit was armed with a short gun. After forcing Rong, the deputy township head, to surrender his pistol, they abducted Rong to the home of township head Cao Guomei. They ordered Rong to knock on Cao's door. Cao, the township head, hearing the noise, put on his clothes and opened the door, whereupon he was immediately seized by the bandits. They demanded that he surrender a fast-firing rifle stock. Unable to resist, Cao handed over the wooden stock of the fast-firing rifle. After obtaining the stock, the bandits fled towards Yiwang Township.

Zhenjiang [Our Dispatch] In order to finance the province's electricity plan, the Jiangsu Provincial Government decided to rebuild the Huaiyin Power Plant and requested the Executive Yuan to allocate a 1,000-kilowatt integrated generator. An advance payment of 140 million yuan was made. Subsequently, the Industrial and Mining Committee of the Executive Yuan telegraphed that the aforementioned machinery had no confirmed delivery date to China. The Executive Yuan also had a small generator that it requested to allocate to the Zhenjiang Water and Electricity Company. After verifying the actual needs of both locations and the pre-war supply situation, it was decided to allocate the 1,000-kilowatt generator to Zhenjiang and the 456-kilowatt generator to Huaiyin. Currently, the Construction Department has dispatched Zhou Jianfei, the preparation commissioner of the Huaiyin Power Plant, and Jiang Renlong, the representative of the Zhenjiang Water and Electricity Company, to Shanghai to resolve the issue.

### Cousin and Sister-in-law Commit Suicide on the Rails; Man's Body Split in Two; Woman's Right Foot Severed, but Rescued

[Our Dispatch from Tianjin, February 2nd] A severed body was discovered near a culvert inside the Tianjin Main Station of the Beining Railway the day before yesterday evening. Upon receiving the report, Left Baorong, the police chief of the Railway Sub-Bureau, immediately led officers to investigate. They also discovered a young woman on top of the culvert, with her right foot severed. She was holding the upper half of the body and wailing, her voice hoarse and weak, until she fainted. After the officers separated the body, the woman still tightly clutched the deceased's felt hat. The woman was immediately sent to the Railway Hospital. After an autopsy, the deceased's body was temporarily claimed by the local guarantor, Wang Zhupo, for temporary burial, while also notifying the family members to come and identify the body.

After the woman was sent to the Railway Hospital, doctors performed surgery, amputating the severed foot. Her condition improved, and she gradually regained consciousness. However, she refused to disclose the reason for the incident. She only claimed that the two siblings came to Tianjin from Beiping to visit relatives but were unsuccessful, leading them to jointly commit suicide. Later, after the Tianjin Municipal District Court Prosecutor's Office sent someone to inquire in detail, the truth was revealed. It was a tragic love suicide on the rails.

According to the woman: Her surname is Ma, her given name is Fenghua, she is from Beiping, 21 years old, and resides at No. 6 Tayuan, outside Deshengmen, Beiping. The deceased's name is Huang Wenxiang, 19 years old, and he is her cousin on her aunt's side. The two are close relatives and have been in love secretly. Huang had proposed marriage to his parents, but was rejected, causing him to become depressed and harbor suicidal thoughts. On the morning of the 30th of last month, Huang met his cousin on the street, and they went together to Zhongshan Park, not returning all night. The next day, they took a train to Tianjin and stayed at the Tianjin Hotel next to the Dong Station. In the evening, they went out together to find a place to die.

After leaving the hotel, Huang Wenxiang and Ma Fenghua wandered by the railway, and the idea of committing suicide on the rails arose.

### Armored Vehicle Department Established at Ordnance School, Headed by He Xuzuan

[Our Dispatch] The Army Armored Corps School of the Ministry of National Defense is the nurturing center for the nation's mechanized units. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was realized that the various armored vehicles needed on the front lines had to be supplied by foreign countries. The small quantity of them affected the organization, tactics, and operations of our army. Therefore, it was decided to establish a College of Armored Vehicle Engineering, headed by Dr. Xiang Renlan, the former Dean of Studies of the Northwest Institute of Technology. Outstanding students in mathematics and physics who had graduated from high school were recruited to specialize in the research and manufacture of armored vehicle engineering, aiming to manufacture armored vehicles domestically. The course of study was five years, so the level of students at the school was even higher than that of ordinary universities. Since its establishment, it has been through eight years. Its graduates are spread throughout the country, serving the nation and contributing greatly. Now, in order to unify the training of ordnance personnel, the Joint Logistics Headquarters has requested the Ministry of National Defense to merge the college with the Ordnance School of the Ordnance Department. He Xuzuan was appointed as the director, and the name was changed to the Armored Vehicle Engineering Department. Together with the school's original "Armament" and "Applied Chemistry" departments, it forms the College of Ordnance Engineering, becoming the highest institution of national defense science, hiring renowned professors from China to teach. The school address has been moved to Paotaiwan, Wusong, in this city. Mr. He Xuzuan is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin and has written extensively, especially with profound knowledge of thermodynamics.

### Improving Scientific Education and Cultivating a Spirit of Creativity; Ministry of Education to Coordinate the Manufacturing of Instruments; Science Museums to be Established Universally in Provinces and Cities

[Nanjing Airmail News] In the past, our country's scientific education in schools has mostly focused on explanation and rote memorization, making it difficult to cultivate the habit of empirical evidence and nurture a spirit of creativity. Public scientific education has received even less attention. Few provinces have established "science museums" in accordance with the Ministry's orders, and most of these are poorly equipped and face financial difficulties, making it difficult to demonstrate results. Therefore, as a result of decades of promoting scientific education, students have very little interest in science, leading to poor academic performance. The public lacks scientific common sense and a scientific spirit, and is still full of superstitious ideas, with no scientific attitude or method in handling affairs and conducting themselves. The Ministry of Education is aware of this and is therefore actively engaged in improving scientific education, having formulated the following measures: (1) Primary and secondary school science education must pay attention to the following matters: 1. Equipment should be enriched to allow children to be immersed in a natural science atmosphere. 2. Encourage children to study independently to stimulate their interest in learning. 3. Improve science teaching materials to suit children's experiences and needs. (2) Provinces and cities that have not yet established science museums should quickly prepare for their establishment within a time limit in accordance with the Ministry's promulgated General Regulations for the Organization of Provincial and Municipal Science Museums. Those that have already been established should raise ample funds and enrich their equipment. The government should allocate foreign exchange to each museum to enrich its equipment, or the Ministry of Education should centrally purchase scientific supplies from abroad and distribute them to each museum for application. (3) People's education centers at all levels should list the promotion of public scientific education as one of their central tasks. (4) "Scientific Experiment Centers" should be universally established in counties and cities for the use of teachers and students of schools at all levels under the jurisdiction of each county and city, as well as for local residents to conduct experiments and research. (5) Coordinate the manufacturing of instruments, specimens, and the compilation and printing of outlines: 1. The Ministry of Education will coordinate, divide the country into several regions based on the distribution of schools, and establish a scientific instrument manufacturing plant in a suitable location in each region to regularly and fully supply the various scientific instruments, specimens, and medicines required by the schools in the region. 2. Instruments and specimens that cannot be manufactured independently, or that cannot be manufactured independently in time due to excessive demand, will be centrally purchased and distributed by the Ministry of Education from abroad based on the actual needs of schools in various provinces and cities across the country. 3. Important books related to scientific education should also be centrally compiled, printed, or translated in large quantities by the Ministry of Education and distributed successively.

### Tongji University: Student Extracurricular Activities: Seven Measures Decided

### Nine Universities Basketball Tournament: A Wonderful Special Feature: Wisconsin Wins All Five Games

[Special Translation by This Newspaper] James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, specifically established thirteen rules to prevent this game of judging victory and defeat from causing rough actions, so that basketball players would not have the opportunity for physical contact with each other during the game. However, more than fifty years ago, after the game, there were often incidents of strong players stalking and beating weak players walking home. Now, only eight years after James' death, he would never have imagined what kind of game students from nine universities in the United States would treat basketball as.

Numerous Fouls

In the "Big Nine" basketball tournament in the United States, as of the middle of last month, the Wisconsin team led the pack with five wins in five games. The scene of the team's hard-fought victory over the Iowa team was unusually intense. The players on both sides were called for a total of 47 fouls, and a total of four players were penalized and left the court. By the end of the game, there were still four players on the court, each of whom had been called for four fouls. The game was held in Madison, Wisconsin, with 13,000 spectators, mostly supporting the home team Wisconsin, shouting non-stop, with their emotions floating, adding fuel to the fire, and booing the Iowa team, which was a bit too much to treat the visiting team.

Jeering at the Referee

The Wisconsin team captain, Miles, fought bravely and knocked an opposing player 15 feet away from the court, onto the lap of a spectator in the front row. Miles was therefore penalized and left the court, and the audience hissed and cursed at the referee, and cheered for Miles. Wei Ya of the Iowa team was short in stature and had competed in Madison last winter, leaving an impression on the audience. In those days, Wei often failed to score near the basket and was ridiculed. The audience shouted: "Shoot! Shoot!" Wei persevered and indeed, his time came and he scored 24 points in a row. In the middle of last month, against the Wisconsin team, Wei Ya also scored 20 points, becoming the highest scorer of the entire game. When Wei Ya was fouled out and left the court, he actually won applause from the entire hall. It is rare for a losing visiting team to receive such honor.

Adding Points to the Home Team

Because of the fans' disturbances, it affected the home team's morale. Therefore, American basketball experts, when encountering such a situation, often add six points to the home team on the scoreboard before the game starts. In such an important program as the "Big Nine Competition," at least ten points should be added. Wisconsin's first five games were all held locally, and they won all of them.

The Wisconsin team uses a full-speed "soccer-style" tactic, running, shooting, without stopping or aiming. However, when the Wisconsin team's forward "Dwarf Chicken" Gu Ke—who was the highest scorer in the "Big Nine" last year—occasionally makes a fixed push shot, the other three Wisconsin team members stand around Gu Ke in front of him, forming a tight screen to increase Gu Ke's confidence and accuracy in shooting.

Game Result

The result of that game was that Wisconsin defeated Iowa 60-51. When the final whistle sounded, an Iowa player shook the scoreboard angrily and shouted: "Wait, let us clean you up in Iowa!"

There is no need to wait that long. The wins and losses among strong American basketball teams are often unpredictable. Five days later, the Michigan team went to Madison, and the Wisconsin team lost 39-43, resulting in the team's first loss of the season. (Chang Nian)

### Ministry of Agriculture Plans to Achieve Food Self-Sufficiency; Increased Production Zones Established in Eleven Provinces

The government is determined to increase food production in order to achieve self-sufficiency. This year, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has formulated an increased production plan. According to Tan, the director of the Agricultural Extension Committee of the Ministry, this year a focus principle will be adopted, setting up increased production zones in grain-producing provinces. It has been decided to set up two to three increased production zones in eleven grain-producing provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Henan, Sichuan, and Fujian. Each increased production zone will designate several counties with the most abundant grain production as food increased production areas. In this area, water conservancy, seeds, and fertilizers must be matched with morning loan policies. The manpower and material resources in this area will be completely concentrated for use. Last year, the Ministry sent personnel to various provinces to conduct on-site investigations, and reports are being compiled. The implementation measures will be determined soon. The Executive Yuan allocated 20 billion yuan last year to prepare for the purchase of rice and wheat seeds, as well as medicines and machinery. This year, it will start with rice, and in the second half of the year, it will focus on wheat and miscellaneous grains. The increased production target for rice this year is 8 million shi. In the past, the management was widespread, but manpower and material resources were easily dispersed, and the results were not significant. Therefore, a focus principle has been adopted, and it must be ensured that the predetermined results are achieved within the deputy-fixed increased production zone.

### Ministry of Finance Issues Circular to Central Bank to Verify Names of Organizational Deposit Accounts

The Ministry of Finance recently issued a circular to the Central Bank, instructing its branches to check organizations and ensure that the true names of the depositors be verified, to prevent abuses. The original letter stated that "According to the reports of various branches of your bank on the inspection of bank operations, the names of the depositors of various organizations are often listed as 'Collection Association,' 'Military Price Difference,' 'Converted Levy Special Account,' 'Operating Expenses,' 'Minnan Taiwan Office,' 'Minzhe Office,' 'Special Tax Funds,' etc., often without the name of the organization, or abbreviated and not detailed, making it difficult to guess and impossible to investigate and correct. In the future, please inform various branch inspection agencies that for this type of organization deposit account names, the true name of the depositing organization must be verified for handling. Appropriate delivery, I hope you check."

### China Farmers Bank Decides to Grant Loans to Cultivate Paper Production in Eastern Jiangxi

According to this newspaper's Nanchang airmail news, the heavy paper produced in Ruijin and Shicheng in eastern Jiangxi enjoyed considerable production and sales during the war due to the difficulty of importing paper. Now that the import of foreign paper is hindered by the shortage of foreign exchange, the printing industry still feels the severity of the paper shortage. In order to assist the handicraft paper production in Jiangxi Province and solve the paper shortage problem, the China Farmers Bank has decided to provide a large amount of production loans in the art paper production area. The head office has sent an expert to Jiangxi for investigation, and has contacted the Commercial Press and Zhonghua Bookstore in Shanghai to use Jiangxi paper to print books. The bureaus also believe that if Jiangxi-produced paper can be improved in accordance with the size of newsprint and improve the nature of paper production, they are also happy to adopt it. The paper industry loan organized by the Agricultural Bank has decided to directly lend to tank households, collect pulp and purchase paper at market prices, and has ordered paper mold bamboo curtains in Nanxiong to lend to tank households. Once the bamboo curtains are made, the loan procedures will begin.

### Britain Reduces Price Limit, Difficulty in Exporting Frozen Eggs

Before the war, the export figure of frozen eggs in our country was about 40,000 tons per year. After the war, exports have sharply decreased. The reason is that the main target, Britain, does not have abundant foreign exchange, and our country's costs have increased sharply. Last year, in order to encourage exports and strive for international market position, the government, through the Export Promotion Office of the Transportation Management Committee, entrusted the China Trust Bureau to purchase a large number of frozen eggs from Maochang Company and transport them to the UK. A total of seven batches were loaded, reaching 3,920 tons. At the beginning of the event, the raw materials in our country were only 1.6 million yuan per market burden, and then gradually rose, breaking through 2 million yuan. Therefore, the first batch of 200 tons cost 48.9 million yuan per ton, the second batch of 100 tons cost 56.775 million yuan per ton, the third batch of 200 tons cost 59.4 million yuan per ton, and the fourth batch of 100 tons cost 62 million yuan per ton. At that time, the selling price in the UK was 200 pounds per ton for 3,110 tons, and the rest was sold for 210 pounds per ton, which was equivalent to a loss of about 250% to 300% per ton in national currency, all of which were subsidized by the government. Later, due to the continuous rise in raw materials, and because Britain based on past spring ice egg price practices, the price limit was reduced from 210 pounds per ton to 200 pounds per ton. It is reported that the current chicken eggs are 3.6 million yuan per market burden, and the actual cost per ton, including labor and electricity, is about 320 pounds. If the government adopts a subsidy policy again, the burden will be too heavy. However, according to industry experts, the price of chicken eggs this spring is lower than the general price level, and according to the ratio, the future price increase will not be fierce. It is estimated that the total output to the UK this year can reach about 7,000 tons. In order to earn foreign exchange, promote exports and maintain the position of our mouse frozen eggs in the international market, the government should comprehensively calculate iron, and not be fussy about the amount of subsidies. In addition, the high cost is not just a raw material, such as the cost of living index, water and electricity, transportation, etc., should be included. Furthermore, the total amount of exports throughout the year and the total amount of foreign exchange obtained should be re-examined and considered their gains and losses to weigh the importance. However, what can be considered is the future stability of the pound sterling.

### Domestic Sulfuric Acid Reaches 150,000 Tons Annually

According to the survey by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, there are about 30 sulfuric acid manufacturing plants in China, spread across Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guiyang, Kunming, Lanzhou, Taiyuan, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Taiwan, and other places, and the market is currently flooded with imported sulfuric acid. According to the manufacturing capacity of domestic sulfuric acid machines, the total annual output can reach 150,000 tons, which is sufficient to meet domestic needs and has surplus. In order to make the industry prosper, imports of foreign goods should be prohibited. The office has now drafted the following plan to guide the industry this year: (1) Change the sulfuric acid import quota to import sulfur, which can save foreign countries and solve the raw material problem. Because one ton of sulfur can make three tons of sulfuric acid. (2) Encourage the establishment of factories using contact method machines to improve quality. (3) Assist the sulfurization factory to increase the production of sulfur to achieve the purpose of self-sufficient raw materials. The planned effect is to establish a factory that can produce 50,000 acid-resistant cans per month and a refining factory that can produce 1,000 tons of sulfur per month within one year, and stipulate the import volume of imported raw materials. The office believes that sulfuric acid production is closely related to national defense, agriculture, and industry, and has decided to present it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for support in order to save important industries.

### Resources Commission to Set Up Iron Smelting Plant on Hainan Island

The iron ore produced on Hainan Island is one of our country's special products. The output is extremely abundant. In addition to being used for barter trade with Japan, there is still a lot of surplus. Unfortunately, due to the underdeveloped industry in our country, it cannot be fully utilized. In response to requests from all parties, the Real Source Committee will specifically set up an iron smelting plant on the island to use the surplus iron ore to smelt iron. The association is actively preparing, and the capital will be borne by the association alone in order to create the healthiest iron and steel plant.

### Science as the Foundation of National Construction

— Liu Xian

—Speech broadcast on Yamei Radio at the invitation of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau—

I think everyone must have a considerable understanding of "science," because our daily life is closely related to science everywhere. But what exactly is science? I am afraid that some people still do not understand it very well, and there is a need for explanation. Simply put, science is a large branch of knowledge that is systematic, organized, and can be experimented with. Science seeks truth from facts and does not engage in empty talk. In the last three hundred years, science has progressed the fastest, with outstanding achievements that cannot be compared to philosophy and literature. We have used scientific discoveries and inventions to expand our knowledge, increase our enjoyment of life, so some people believe that science is the cornerstone of modern civilization and the source of human wisdom. It has been developed to its current stage and is truly a miracle in the process of human thought development.

Since two atomic bombs took effect in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, they ended World War II ahead of schedule, saving countless lives, and the power of science was thus displayed to the extreme. Until now, all international political, diplomatic, economic, and military trends have been affected by the atomic bomb to some extent. There is no doubt that it is now the world of science and has entered the era of atomic energy.

Science is not only the nanny of modern material civilization, but also the foundation of national construction. Didn't we shout the slogan of "Resistance War and National Construction" during the Anti-Japanese War? This is the unanimous request of the whole country. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been over for more than two years, logically, we should have embarked on the road to national construction long ago, but because of the many troubles in the country, the great cause of national construction has never started to move forward, and a good opportunity has been missed due to following old ways. This is such a pity! We have gone through eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, and the country's vitality has been greatly damaged, and the people are suffering deeply. Improving people's livelihoods and cultivating national strength are really matters of urgency. In addition, the world situation after the war is turbulent and unstable, the wheels of the times are constantly moving forward, and the great powers are all making plans for national defense security and striving for post-war economic recovery. If we do not seize the opportunity to engage in national construction to meet the urgent needs, not to mention that the fruits of this victory will be difficult to protect, if a third world war breaks out, then our national defense security and national destiny will be unimaginable. Therefore, based on these two reasons, the rise and fall of our country and the prosperity and decline of our nation depend on whether we can build the country from destruction. This task is arduous, the responsibility is great, and the road is long, so everyone must work together.

In order to seek national security and to fight for national survival, we believe that the progress of national construction is of importance to the times. We should have a long-term vision, we must have ideals for national construction, we must consult extensively and visit widely, and we must have plans for national construction. This is to seek happiness for compatriots across the country, and at the same time to lay the foundation for future generations.

The so-called ideal of national construction is to say that we should build this fragmented country of ours into a rich, strong, healthy, and happy country. We should examine the national conditions internally, observe the general trend externally, conform to the trend of the world, modernize this old civilized country of ours, educate the many ignorant and uneducated people, and revive the morals that are about to be lost. In short, we should use the collective wisdom and effort to build our lovely motherland, which is large, rich in resources, and populous, into an independent, free, peaceful, and democratic country. This is our ideal, this is our vision.

However, the great cause of national construction is complex and cannot be achieved overnight. We need meticulous plans. With perfect plans, we can then implement them step by step, build them in stages, train talents, and raise funds. Like the Soviet Union's implementation of several five-year plans, it has received great results in national construction, and is now implementing the first new five-year plan after the war, which can serve as our model. Therefore, we should use meticulous and accurate methods, enlarge our vision, formulate plans, implement them in stages, build them in different places, expedite what is urgent, and postpone what can be postponed. If five-year plans are not enough, make ten-year plans, and if ten-year plans are not enough, prepare for twenty-year plans. In the end, we will definitely be able to achieve the goal of national construction. We are citizens of the Republic of China, we must have self-confidence, we are descendants of the Yellow Emperor, we must have a grand spirit. Qin Shihuang built the Great Wall, and Emperor Yang of Sui opened the Grand Canal, both of which established great achievements in human history. Is it possible that we, living in the twentieth century today, having received scientific education, cannot follow in the footsteps of our ancestors and build our country successfully?

Now we are standing from a scientific point of view, thinking that no matter how lofty our ideals for national construction are, how beautiful our plans are, how firm our confidence is, and how grand our spirit is, if we want to achieve our ideals, realize our plans, strengthen our beliefs, and exert our spirit, we cannot but pay attention to a potential factor, and that is the application of science. In other words, science is the foundation of our national construction. Without science as a foundation, national construction cannot be started. Without science, there is no national defense, and without science, there is no talk of improving people's livelihoods. It can even be said that a person without scientific knowledge is not worthy of being a modern person, and a country without scientific culture cannot be called a modern country.

Recently, the National Economic Commission drafted a set of economic reform programs, the content of which is divided into industry, agriculture, mining, water conservancy, transportation, finance, and finance, which is quite detailed. If it can be fully implemented and completed within the time limit, it can be regarded as part of the work of national construction. However, the scientific knowledge and technical talents required are not few. For example, the various departments of industry, water conservancy, and transportation are nothing but the application of mathematics, physics, and chemistry, agriculture is based on biology, and mining is based on geology, chemistry, and so on. Therefore, if we want to promote the application of science, we must first pay attention to the research of pure science. If the foundation of pure science is well laid, application is very easy. In other words, if our scientific research has made achievements, economic reform will also be easier. Water has a source, and the Tai has a root. The foundation of our national construction is based on science.

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to arouse the attention of the government authorities, social sages, and scientific circles, that is, the great cause of national construction is underway, and there is no room for mistakes, so it should meet the needs of the times, so it should protect the country's position, and even more so it should seek national unity; there must be perfect plans, there must be a scientific foundation, more funds should be raised, talents should be recruited widely, priorities should be distinguished, and construction should be carried out at any time and in any place. The government presides over the overall plan, the social figures provide assistance from the sidelines, and scientists work hard to engage in it. The three parties work together, bury their heads in hard work, and take twenty years as the time limit. I believe that our great cause of national construction will be successfully completed. The country will benefit and the nation will be blessed! (February 6)

### Calcium Carbide

— Bao Zhongqi

The Mother of the Chemical Industry

When you are walking on the road at night, don't you see bright lights burning at the fruit stands on both sides of the sidewalk? This is what we know as a calcium carbide lamp.

The principle of a calcium carbide lamp is very simple: just add water to calcium carbide, and it produces a flammable gas, commonly known as calcium carbide gas, which ignites upon contact with fire.

In fact, to explain this phenomenon scientifically, the scientific name of calcium carbide is calcium carbide CaF2. It reacts with water to produce acetylene C2H2. Isn't this principle very simple?

Don't underestimate this gas, acetylene, with its foul phosphine odor. Its uses encompass every aspect of the chemical industry and can be considered the foundation of China's future chemical endeavors.

Here, let's analyze and introduce its uses:

In the workshops of repair shops or ironmongers, don't we often see workers using a dazzling flame to do welding work? This is an oxy-acetylene torch, which combines acetylene and oxygen.

However, the most important use of acetylene is not in these areas. It can act like an intermediate product, producing countless important compounds. For example, three molecules of acetylene can polymerize to form benzene (Benzene). Benzene is the starting point for aromatic compounds in organic chemistry. Medicines, dyes, and explosives all start from benzene. The reason why the chemical industry is so developed abroad is entirely due to the extraction of large quantities of benzene from coal tar. Of course, this task is not easy to accomplish in China. Therefore, if China wants to develop various chemical industries in the future, the source of benzene, apart from imported goods, will have to rely on the polymerization of acetylene.

The uses of acetylene are not limited to these. It is also the starting point for aliphatic compounds in organic chemistry. Alcohol, gasoline, and soap can all be made from it.

Acetylene, or rather calcium carbide, is simply the nucleus of the chemical industry. Its research can be said to include a part of chemistry in the scientific plan. Chemists already have a beautiful vision for it.

The problem lies in China's lack of the only driving force! Hydropower. As long as the YVA's hydropower generation plan can proceed as ideal, who can say that China's chemical industry has no future!

### Printed Radio

— Ni Shangda

The vacuum tube is the heart of a radio; resistors, coils, and capacitors are the skeleton of a radio. Given the current manufacturing and design of these four components, the smallest radio that can be assembled still needs to be about ten cubic inches in size. Recently, some forward-thinking radio engineers in the United States have considered using chemically specialized liquids, such as ink or oil-based paint, for resistors, coils, and capacitors, printing or spraying them onto insulating sheets to make a radio that is a lightweight, portable, flat body. This way, mass production can be achieved using printing methods, reducing costs and eliminating the time-consuming work of repairing radios. Generally, those engaged in the radio industry know that repairing machines is the most complicated and time-consuming work, resulting in the greatest monetary expenditure. With printed radios, everything would be standardized. If a machine breaks down, one could simply discard the old one and buy a new one, only paying a very low price. Repairing old machines would no longer be necessary, saving time and labor, as is obvious. Furthermore, the radio manufacturing industry would undergo a complete transformation. When we first heard this, we were amazed and wondered how it could become a reality. In fact, the grid resistors currently used can be drawn on insulating paper with a pencil or ink, creating stripes with a high resistance of several teraohms. Extrapolating from this, using solutions of various organic or inorganic compounds, it is not difficult to create stripes with smaller resistance to serve as generally applicable resistors. Coils already exist in the form of flat spider webs. Instead of using wire, a conductive liquid could be printed on an insulating sheet to create inductors with appropriate inductance. The manufacture of capacitors has already achieved the ability to spray metal powder onto insulating paper. Thus, the miniaturization of capacitors is also not a problem. Vacuum tubes already have peanut tubes and acorn tubes, which are very small, almost the size of fruit kernels.

Recently, there has also been the so-called microtube, which is slightly larger than a grain of rice, and has been designed and manufactured by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards for use in military radios. Although the details have not been released, the miniaturization of vacuum tubes has already transitioned from an ideal to a reality. The magnetic alloy "Alinco" is small in size but has strong magnetism, allowing it to be used to manufacture small speakers, as well as very small generators to serve as radio power sources. From this perspective, considering the current products and future trends, coupled with the industrial equipment and engineering talent in the United States, printed radios will surely be available for sale in the market with a few years of effort. Ideals are the mother of reality. If, forty years ago, when the first spark-gap radio transmitter was being built in England, someone had talked about today's television or radar, everyone would have dismissed it as a fool's dream. The way we see the past is no different from the way those in the future will see the present. Let us regard today's printed radios as the radar of forty years ago and wait and see.

### The Smallest Microscope

— Hong En

Microscopes no larger than a pencil are now available for use by scientists. The eyepiece can be rotated to determine the focus, and one end of the objective lens is cut with an oblique block to provide light. It is simple and convenient, and with a magnification of 25x, it is sufficient to observe tiny, powder-like substances.

### Scientific Gleanings

— Xie Zhangtao

Planting Grass by Air - To prevent rainwater from eroding the surface soil and silting up river channels, the United States has recently used airplanes to spread weed seeds. After they grow, they can prevent surface soil erosion. One airplane can sow seeds over an area of 20,000 acres in one day. 10,000 acres requires 240 tons of seeds, and the seeding cost per acre is $2.03, of which seeds account for $0.28.

Giant Iron Vehicle - The earth-moving machine, weighing 1,100 tons, which was assembled in three months using parts transported by 45 trucks at a coal mine in Indiana, USA, has begun to work. This machine can excavate 35,000 cubic yards of soil per day, which is equivalent to excavating the foundation of 200 houses. Its digging shovel is so large that a large truck can drive into it with room to spare. This "giant hand" can fill an entire freight train car with only two digs. It uses 1,800 horsepower as power and only requires three people to manage.

Water Bombs Save Forests - Every year, forest fires cause the United States to lose 31 million acres of forest. Therefore, the United States is now using new and effective airplanes carrying fire-extinguishing bombs filled with water or chemicals to drop and rescue the forests. Each B-29 aircraft can carry eight 165-gallon water bombs, which are dropped close to the flames and automatically dissolve into a rain screen that descends.

### Sex Determination of Single Female Reproductive Offspring (Continued)

— Xie Yeying

We know that the maturation of ordinary bisexual reproductive cells must undergo a reduction division, the result of reduction division is that only half of the original number of chromosomes remains in the egg and sperm cells. That is, in spermatogonia and oogonia, the chromosomes are diploid (2n), and when they divide into mature sperm and eggs, the number of chromosomes is reduced by half, leaving only haploid (n) chromosomes. These eggs and sperm with haploid chromosomes, if combined and fertilized, the chromosomes in the fertilized egg will return to the original diploid state.

Eggs that undergo single female reproduction, one type undergoes reduction division, so the mature egg only has a haploid set of chromosomes. One type does not undergo reduction division and still retains a diploid set of chromosomes. Whether the egg undergoes reduction division or not is the key to whether the chromosomes are haploid or diploid; and whether the number of chromosomes is haploid or diploid directly affects the sex determination of the offspring. Therefore, from a cytological and genetic point of view, single female reproduction can be divided into three categories: haploid chromosome single female reproduction, diploid chromosome single female reproduction, and alternating haploid and diploid chromosome single female reproduction.

(A) Haploid parthenogenesis:

Like ticks, bees, ants, wasps, etc., the eggs of single female reproduction normally undergo reduction division before maturation. The offspring developed from this type of egg with half the number of chromosomes are mostly male. So it may as well be said that haploid parthenogenesis is probably male offspring parthenogenesis. For example, in (1) Tetranychus binocnlatus in the tick family, according to Schrader's research in 1923, the unfertilized eggs of females develop independently and can only become male offspring. He examined that there are six chromosomes (diploid) in the oogonia, and only three chromosomes (haploid) in the mature egg. This proves that the reason why the offspring produced by such single female reproduction are male is because the chromosomes are haploid. If the eggs produced by the female are combined with sperm for fertilization, the offspring developed from the fertilized eggs are mostly female. Because the diploid (six) chromosomes are restored in the fertilized egg cells. What seems difficult to understand is that since the male offspring of this type of single female reproduction only have a haploid (three) set of chromosomes, do their spermatogonia in the future need to undergo reduction division again when they divide and mature into sperm? If they undergo reduction division again, won't the number of chromosomes decrease generation by generation, becoming less and less? The fact has proven that the sperm produced by this type of male offspring does not undergo reduction division during its maturation process. While the maturation process of female eggs always undergoes reduction. Therefore, haploid parthenogenesis can only produce male bodies, while the offspring evolved from fertilized eggs are often female bodies. Furthermore, we can examine the reproductive situation of bees: (2) In the bee group, there are three types: drones, queens, and worker bees. Both queens and worker bees are female (but worker bees are infertile females, unless the queen in the group dies suddenly, they can turn into fertile females and produce eggs that develop into drones). The chromosomes in the nuclei of all queen bee cells are 32 (2n), and the chromosomes in the nuclei of all drone bee cells are 16 (n). When the oogonia of the queen bee undergo mature division, they must undergo reduction division. Therefore, only 16 chromosomes remain in all mature eggs, and the offspring evolved from such eggs with haploid chromosomes are always male. While the offspring evolved after sperm and egg combine for fertilization are often female. The most detailed research on bee reproduction is by Meves and Nachtschein. From 1901 to 1907, Meves studied the sperm development of bees and wasps (Vsepa). He not only saw 16 chromosomes in spermatogonia, but also proved that sperm also had the same 16 chromosomes. In 1913, Nachtschein proved that queens and worker bees both have diploid chromosomes, with a number of 32, while drones only have haploid chromosomes, with a number of 16. When drone sperm undergoes mature division, there is a movement close to reduction division in the primary spermatocytes, but it does not actually reduce the number, and only a polar body without a nucleus is expelled, so the sperm still retains 16 chromosomes.

The above two examples not only illustrate the reason why haploid parthenogenesis evolves into male offspring, but also explain why the offspring evolved from these animals during bisexual mating reproduction are often female. (Zhu Wan)

### Fool's New Year

— Bai Yong

Shanghai slang: "Wang Xiaoer's New Year, each year is worse than the last." My hometown has a saying: "A fool's New Year—looking at the neighbors." Neighbors mean the people in the neighborhood. Even a fool knows about the New Year, right? The original meaning is just to say that everything can be imitated from the wise. But today, the New Year only has the path of looking at the neighbors, and we writers who sell our words to make a living can hardly talk about the word "New Year."

The east neighbor makes a living by slaughtering cattle. He was originally very poor. Since the autumn, he has transported beef from other ports and sold it in this port at high prices, making several times the profit. He has gradually changed his appearance, from bowing his head and frowning to raising his eyebrows and exhaling. Recently, he transported batches of water buffalo from the countryside, sold them, and then took back the price of the cattle. As a result, he made more money and lived a better life. His daughter bought a new coat, his wife bought a new ring, his young master called himself a "young master," and his father was of course the boss. His arrogant appearance made the poor scholars feel intimidated. Moreover, the checks and bank drafts from his own shop were waved around, and tens of millions of gold coins came in and out with a stroke of a pen, which was truly shocking. However, in the past few days, the situation has suddenly changed. The villagers came to demand the price of the cattle, and the courtyard was full of curses, and the sound of weeping filled the ears. The boss was sighing, and the young master was avoiding him. Outsiders were puzzled, but it seemed that they could roughly understand that he had sold the cattle for money and spent it himself. Now that he has no way to pay, he has to tear down other people's walls.

The west neighbor runs a coal shop. He used to be a fellow in a coal shop. When the Japanese came, the boss ran away, and he took over the shop. He actually managed it well. Last year, he earned tens of millions. This year, he can of course count in hundreds of millions. Although he is illiterate, he is not stingy in betting millions when playing mahjong. His son no longer studies the useless middle school, but manages the accounts in the shop. When he meets people, he always says: "What's the use of studying? It's better to do business."

The south neighbor is a senior official of a certain high-level administrative agency. He lives in a dormitory allocated by the government, with a wife and two children, but he hasn't even prepared cotton clothes properly. The sixty-year-old man borrows money outside every day. If it weren't for the flour allocated by the government, eating would have become a problem long ago. Now, let's not talk about the New Year. The tuition fees for the two children alone cost 10 million, enough to make him frown for a month.

Pickled fish and cured meat are hung on other people's windowsills. Today, he buys firewood. Tomorrow, he buys rice. He eats New Year's Eve dinner and pastes Spring Festival couplets. The children have a new set of clothes today and a new hat tomorrow. Firecrackers are set off with a bang, and the gongs and drums are beating.

Can you not be threatened by the New Year? Can you say, "The world is in chaos and the people are poor, what New Year are we celebrating?" It is we who are poor. What does it have to do with others? If a fool doesn't look at the neighbors, at least he won't know that it's the New Year. If he sees others celebrating the New Year, but he has no New Year to celebrate himself, that's a big problem. In the meaning of the proverb, it is said that the fool has not tried to celebrate the New Year, but just doesn't know how to celebrate it. Now, it is knowing but not being able to do it, and it is not that he can't do it himself, but that "firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea are all in other people's homes." If you are not a fool, you have to pretend to be a fool. If you are not foolish, you have to pretend to be foolish. The last two sentences of the previous poem say, "I can't be sad at all, and I will cultivate the bright moon and plant plum blossoms." Perhaps only saints can cultivate this, or else they are complete and authentic Ah Qs. We ordinary people are forced to be under the "strong yoke," and we can't help but feel our own insignificance and danger. In this urgent scene of the end of the year, we really feel the intrusion of our complaints and sorrows.

### On Severe Punishment

— Ren Weiyin

There have been many events in recent days, and the source of the chaos has not been eliminated. Many people naturally talk about the issue of "using severe punishment," and they gnash their teeth, wishing they could immediately come up with some method to clarify this chaotic situation.

The idea of "governing a chaotic world with severe punishment" comes from the Book of Lord Shang. Shang Yang and Han Fei believed that human nature was moving in an increasingly bad direction, and to cure the prevalent disease of "taking advantage of opportunities for profit," it was necessary to use severe punishments, but not to make severe punishment the sole purpose. Han Fei said: "A wise ruler establishes rewards that can be obtained and sets up laws that can be avoided, so virtuous people are encouraged to seek rewards, and unworthy people rarely receive punishment." He also said: "The wise ruler's rewards are like timely rain, and the people benefit from its dew; his punishments are like thunder, and even the gods cannot change them. If there is indeed merit, then difficult and distant people must be rewarded; if there is something wrong, then even close relatives must be punished." Han! At that time, the abbreviation of "democracy" was still a question mark, but he said that rewards are like timely rain, making the people clear about their benefits, and the law is like thunder, which even the gods cannot change. This is the modern spirit of law. His thoughts originally came from Lao Tzu. Lao Tzu talked about politics and advocated "doing things in the beginning, and starting from the beginning of the chaos." Therefore, he said: "Those who use soldiers are not known for their great achievements." There is no need to seek remedies after the fact, but should be dredged in advance. Wang Bi annotated Lao Tzu, saying that he "acts in accordance with nature, does not create or start." Since he can prevent problems before they occur, why should he be anxious afterwards? Therefore, Lao Tzu said: "Kindness can conquer, simplicity can broaden, and not failing is the first in the world, so it can become a vessel for growth." It is really a treasure book for governing the family for thousands of generations.

In Lao Tzu's era, the world did not seem to be so chaotic. The moral standards at that time were still at the stage of "loyalty, trustworthiness, benevolence, and righteousness." Lao Tzu said, "Ritual is a thinness of loyalty and trustworthiness, and the beginning of chaos." Later, even "ritual" could not play a role in society, so they talked about "punishment" and "military expeditions." Han Fei advocated talking about "avoidable" punishments and implementing "achievable" rewards, the purpose of which was still to save the world and to save human nature. The "severe punishment" used to govern a chaotic world is not to take pleasure in "punishment" for a while.

Now, the successive "chaos" inevitably makes some people feel that the authorities are too lenient, and the call for "using severe punishment" is also becoming more and more vocal. But if we think carefully, is "overly lenient governance" also a "source of chaos"? And have fundamental considerations been made in advance for certain practical livelihood issues of the people? Therefore, although we fully support the saying of "governing a chaotic world with severe punishment," this is conditional, "something to do, something not to do." After all, "soldiers" are "inauspicious weapons," not "gentlemen's weapons." They must be used as a last resort, and "tranquility should be the main thing."

The conclusion still uses Lao Tzu's saying: "Kindness can win in war," and then quotes Zhuge Liang's saying that "the law should be enforced and gratitude should be known," so as to avoid provoking greater resentment.

### Before Dinner

— Ji Mo

Before dinner every day, I always make a small vow to myself: I must eat half a bowl of rice less tonight. Because, based on past experience, if I eat too much, as soon as I put down my rice bowl, I often fall asleep, regardless of my wife's advice, and don't want to do anything. And the time indicated by the clock on the table is often only seven o'clock and a quarter.

According to the customs of society, these days are the end of the lunar year. Not only do shops have to be busy closing accounts, but also personal matters seem to need to be finished so that they can prepare for the "year's plan in spring" for the coming year.

I am not very busy, but there are many trivial matters that have not been sorted out, and it seems that most of them are literary debts. For example, the "Introduction to ×× Learning" specially commissioned by a certain bookstore has not yet been submitted, and the short essay requested by the ×× magazine has not yet been written. I am even afraid to go to the ×× magazine to chat with the editor, lest he ask me for the "debt" in person. In addition, I must finish revising an essay entrusted to me by a certain gentleman within the lunar year.

Therefore, I really have to implement the small vow mentioned at the beginning of this article. If I don't let my stomach be too full, I can always drive away the feeling of fatigue and start a night car.

Naturally, another way to force yourself to work is to delay the time for dinner. Before dinner, read more reference books or write more sections of text. Today I adopted this new doctrine. When I got home, I lay on the sofa and was about to pull out that thick "Statistical Methods" written by Professor Mills from the bookshelf, but after a day of work, I couldn't help but steal a moment of leisure and unconsciously pulled out a memoir of interviews written by a reporter from the American World Telegraph, Mr. Smith, to read.

This book records many sporadic stories, mostly about the film city. For example, he went to Hollywood and discovered that the scenery of "Shangri-La," which is known as the paradise in Coleman's "Lost Horizon," was actually a mound overgrown with weeds. Also, when the film "Waterloo Bridge" was being staged in a certain place in the United States, it happened that the protagonist of the film, Miss Vivien Leigh, also came to the theater to visit. In his pen, she is a petite and exquisite woman. At that time, she was nervous and, in order to avoid being surrounded by fans, he volunteered to accompany her out of the side door of the theater. The book also says that some big stars in the film city rarely go to New York once in four or five years, which seems to be a strange thing to people who have never been to the United States.

I read on like this unconsciously. In a flash, my wife was busy preparing dinner for me. It was already 8 o'clock. The neighbors were eating New Year's Eve dinner today and sent us a bowl of braised chicken with chestnuts. My wife also prepared for me the meatloaf steamed egg that I liked to eat. I couldn't help but exceed the amount I originally limited. As a result, I still put my work aside temporarily and fell asleep as soon as I lay down. According to my wife's report the next day, I started snoring less than three minutes after I went to bed.

### Light Snowflakes See Off the Old Year

— Lei Hong

These past few nights, I've been leaning over my desk by the window, the sounds of New Year's drums on the road have been quite lively. Amidst this hurried fading year, the people's emotions towards the end of the year naturally give rise to a feeling of celebration. The Lunar New Year's deep roots in the hearts of the people can be said to be of long-standing history and very much in accordance with nature.

On New Year's Eve, what's most easily stirred up are childhood memories. The more years one spends away from one's hometown, the more one thinks of the good old days: when we were still carrying embroidered ball lanterns, pulling rabbit lanterns, unknowingly and unconsciously spending a joyous New Year's Eve. Although in the drowsy late night, even though the adults urged us to go to sleep, we still refused, clinging nostalgically to the table, watching our mother carefully wrapping ten copper coins in red envelopes made of plum-red paper, so crisp and neat, wrapping them into envelopes without the slightest wrinkle, in preparation for the needs of the servants on New Year's Day... The sound of gongs and drums of the New Year constantly came from the surroundings, and all the rituals of sealing wells, taking over the household, and burning incense to the heavens, were always held after midnight. We had to wait, a kind of inexplicable waiting, only feeling very excited, and only when the third watch had dripped away, would we slowly go into the room that had been熏ed with rue and was filled with the heavy scent of New Year's Eve to sleep. At this time, the red candles on the candlestick had formed candle flowers in the jumping flames, symbolizing good fortune for the New Year.

This year's Beginning of Spring (立春) is especially early, the solar term for Beginning of Spring arrives on the 25th day of the twelfth lunar month. And on the eve of the Beginning of Spring, there was a whole day of winter snow, flying all over the sky like feathers. Farmers regard winter snow as an auspicious omen, predicting a good harvest for the coming year. Beginning of Spring is the first season in the lunar calendar, and it can also be said to be the New Year's Day of seasons. Therefore, a snowstorm on the eve of the Beginning of Spring perfectly matches the line from Jiannan's poem: "Light snowflakes see off the old year." This is the only New Year's Eve poem collected in Fang Weng's poetry collection, which says:

"A few huts by wild water and maple forest,
A cold stove without fire, sitting without a mat,
The dim lamp shines on a lonely shadow,
Light snowflakes see off the old year,
Pepper wine wards off warmth, poured sparkling,
Blue-robed captives dance lightly;
From now on, offer spring shepherd's purse as a delicacy,
Don't worry, Foolish Old Man, about ten thousand coins a day!" Jiannan Weng's poems are broad and lovely. Like this New Year's Eve poem, it still inevitably has a sense of one's life experience at the beginning, thus especially in the season when the year is about to end, it evokes a feeling of one's own vastness. The poetic realm seems to be very narrow, and what is poured into it is all personal feelings of loneliness. But from the fourth line, "Seeing off the old year", the heart expands, "From now on, offer spring shepherd's purse as a delicacy, Don't worry, Foolish Old Man, about ten thousand coins a day", isn't it another expression of the emotion "If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" Compared to the endless desolation of the New Year's Eve poem at Liangdangxuan: "Standing alone on the city bridge, no one recognizes me, watching a star like the moon for a long time," the former feels more graceful and open-minded. There is much optimism in Fang Weng's poems, such as "Being poor, I don't plan for tomorrow, when the mood comes, I'm young again", such as "After the rain, a thousand layers of evening mountains are green, flowers fall into a stream, the fragrance of spring water", such as "Don't sigh about dust in plain clothes, it's still possible to get home by Qingming",... it's certainly not just this one New Year's Eve poem that is like this.

If it were in today's cities, people are ultimately happy, in every winter, they can spend two joyous festivals, the Western one is Christmas; while the essence of the country is the Lunar New Year. And the latter is closer to the people, almost every household, large and small, will be lively. Even in the most difficult times, they must brush away the coldness in their hearts and anticipate the warmth of the coming spring. Speaking of the most difficult times, I once wrote an essay on the same topic, ending with the hope that the world would return to clamor. Of course, at that time, my mood was very suffocating, even writing articles had to go around in circles, so euphemistic to the point of being indescribable. At that time, the so-called clamor referred to defeating the enemy and achieving victory. Of course, my mood is very different when I write this article tonight, but it seems that the situation of myriad difficulties has turned another page, but we must have hope, just like tonight's New Year's Eve, after passing the old year, there will definitely be a new year coming.

### Russian Humor

— Fang Ji

Once, a representative from a certain country went to see a Russian official and asked, "May I ask, why is that thing on your desk placed like that?"

The official said, "This is my thing, I can put it wherever I want!"

The representative went to the official residence of another official and saw that the official's chair was hanging from the ceiling, so he politely asked for the details.

The official became angry and said, "This is my chair, I can put it wherever I want!"

Finally, the representative met Stalin and asked him about the two things above. Stalin said, "Don't mind them, they're just idiots."

"Then why do you use these idiots?"

Stalin said angrily, "These are my idiots, I can put them wherever I want, what's it to you?"

### Mourning Teacher Huang Boqiao

— Qin Shouou

It has been a long time since I have had any emotional surges, but this morning, something like the buzzing of bees pierced my heart.

I personally received the teachings of Teacher Huang Boqiao for three years, and later continued to receive his guidance at the two-route bureau for about four years; in those seven years, there was hardly a day that I did not see his round, white, solemn face, and hear his unique, clear, and firm voice. In the thirty-nine years of my life, the impression he left on me is so profound that there is no one else besides my grandparents and parents. So when I suddenly saw the news of his death in the newspaper, I felt very sad, especially because in the past one or two years, due to my own foolishness and stubbornness—in order to avoid seeing someone I deeply hated, I had not even visited him, and now, no matter what I think of, I can no longer see his face or hear his voice!

Teacher Huang can be said to be a person who truly belongs to the country and society. His concept of the individual self was so faint that it was almost non-existent. He didn't accumulate money, didn't acquire any property, and never felt the slightest bit unhappy about not having any children. Apart from paying attention to maintaining his health for the sake of his work, food and clothing were simply dispensable to him. Many people say that he lacked emotion and was not very willing to help his fellow villagers, classmates, relatives, and friends, and this may not be untrue, because his interest was always unreservedly focused on the cause he was shouldering, and all he cared about was his own work, so of course he had no time to think about other things!

All those who had traveled on the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways before the war sincerely admired his achievements, even those who were dissatisfied with him due to personal grudges could not but be impressed. His success was due to nothing other than that he did not have a day, not a thing, that he did not do earnestly and practically. I dare to say presumptuously: if after the victory, the government could have asked Teacher Huang to serve as the President of the Executive Yuan, things in the country would definitely not be as bad as they are today! To say that he was an engineering expert would be to underestimate him!

Teacher Huang suffered from diabetes and heart failure throughout his life. Given his spirit and perseverance, his achievements would definitely not have been limited to what they are now; but now, his life has been taken away at the young age of fifty-five.

In Teacher Huang's will, he strongly advocated not sending funeral wreaths or holding memorial services, which was still his consistent style in life. In order to respect his wishes, I feel that we, his students and old friends, really don't need to send any more flower baskets or wreaths or hold any memorial services. I personally plan to gather former classmates and raise a sum of money for a "Huang Boqiao Memorial Scholarship" as a long-term memorial.

### Reputation

— Zhimin

Reputation lost in an instant, cannot be restored in a hundred years. (Italian)

Rather damage the body than reputation. (Turkish)

An evil wound can be healed, an evil name cannot be healed. A person who has lost his reputation, though alive, is as good as dead. One without reputation is a walking dead. (Spanish Proverb)

Better to be poor with a good name than rich with dishonor. (Dutch Proverb)

Chapter 10 Voluntary Sacrifice (67)

Seeing that Qiwan did not reply, Yuru picked up the cane leaning against the chair and said sadly, "Miss Gu, please forgive me, I have said all I wanted to say, please consider it. I'm leaving!" Saying that, he dragged his trembling steps and walked out step by step. Qiwan watched this situation, her conscience greatly stimulated, and she was very distressed. Seeing Yuru's old and frail state and his hesitant steps, just about to step out of the room, she couldn't help but shout, "Old man, don't go." Yuru turned around and asked, "Is there anything else?" Qiwan said with a crying voice, "Old man, please come back, I have something to tell you." After saying this, she leaned on the table and cried loudly. Yuru turned around, walked closer to her, patted her back with his hand and said, "Good child, I know you are sad. You have a conscience, your love with Zhu is pure, it cannot be broken apart, it's a pity you met too late, this is a lack of perfection in life. You don't need to be sad now, just let it go, anyway, I am an old man of sixty, how many years can I live! You have a great future, don't worry about us old people. I am his mentor, even if he abandons me, I will have no regrets. I am willing to use these short, boring years to wish you eternal happiness!" Qiwan heard this, cried even harder and said, "No! It can't be like this, I will sacrifice myself, I can't destroy Zhu's family, especially you, old man, who has nurtured him for so long, how can I be so selfish, I am although I am infatuated, how can I be unreasonable. I must not let my personal thoughts harm others, I will never marry him!" Qiwan was very sad when she said this, and couldn't help but continue to shed tears. Yuru saw her emotions agitated and heard her say this, and his heart was very moved. He couldn't help but shed a few old tears, wiping the corners of his eyes with a handkerchief, and saying, "I know you are a good child, you are wronging yourself to take care of Zhu, but I don't want you to sacrifice yourself like this." Qiwan said, "No, I can't just consider myself and ruin his whole family, even if Zhu loves me extremely, he is a person with a conscience, as time passes, if he sees you, old man, so sad, he may have regrets one day, then what should I do! I understand now, I love Zhu, but I can't marry him, his circumstances don't allow me to marry him. Thank you for your teachings, old man, I understand everything completely! I can only sacrifice myself now to protect Zhu's whole family, this is how I love Zhu."

Current Official Deeply Addicted to Habits Treats Younger Siblings as Strangers

Chen Wei asks: I have three brothers and one sister. My sister and I were born to my father's second wife. Our family is poor. My eldest brother, with my father's frugal sacrifices, was cultivated until he graduated from university. After my father passed away, the family scattered. My eldest brother was then serving in a central ministry. Due to being addicted to habits, he neglected the livelihood of his stepmother and siblings. I only completed the second year of junior high school and dropped out. Later, my eldest brother introduced me to work in a certain agency. During the Japanese occupation, my mother and sister lived a life no different from begging, but my eldest brother and others did not care. My mother passed away last year due to eight years of hardship and physical weakness. My eldest brother did not take any responsibility for the aftermath. Now, his addiction has not been overcome. Although he is currently a serving official, his behavior is very improper. May I ask: (1) Judging from the above situation, should I have a real responsibility to support him? (2) Can I publish in the newspaper to sever relations with him? If it is not signed by the other party, will it be legally effective?

[Tang Mingshi, legal counsel of this column, replies]

(1) Brothers and sisters have a moral obligation to help each other, but not a legal responsibility. (2) To publish in the newspaper to sever brotherly relations does not require the other party's signature; but the relationship of brothers and relatives is inherent and cannot be severed; what is desired to be severed is economic responsibility only, but since the law is as stated above, whether to sever or not is not a legal issue.
