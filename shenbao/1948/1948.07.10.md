On the evening of the 8th, enemy New 8th, 9th, and 7th columns launched fierce attacks on the outskirts of the southwest city gates. However, due to the close cooperation of the defending troops with the air force, the enemy ultimately failed. When Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi flew over Yanzhou in a special plane on the morning of the 9th, he saw that the enemy was mostly entrenched within the five, six, seven, or eight li of fortifications surrounding the city, not daring to move. The soldiers and civilians inside the city were greatly encouraged by Commander-in-Chief Liu's personal visit to express his concern. In the past two weeks, the enemy's casualties in the siege of Yanzhou have reached more than 10,000.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 9th Dispatch] The National Army advancing from Jinan crossed Tai'an on the 8th and engaged the enemy's 13th Column more than ten li south of Tai'an. At this moment, the National Army on the Tai'an, Feicheng, and Pingyin lines and the National Army advancing north from Lincheng are launching a pincer attack from the north and south on the enemy forces surrounding Yanzhou.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 9th Dispatch] Liu Zhi flew over Yanzhou at 8:00 AM today to supervise the battle, then flew to Jinan, and returned to Xuzhou at 5:00 PM in the afternoon.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 9th Dispatch] Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi, accompanied by Deputy Chief of Staff Zhang Jin, Secretary Liu Ziqing, and Chief of General Affairs Hu Fo, flew from Xuzhou to the skies over Yanzhou in a special plane at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 9th to express his regards to all the soldiers and civilians defending the city. The special plane arrived at 9:30 AM. Commander-in-Chief Liu immediately spoke with Commander Li Yutang via radio for five minutes, expressing great concern for all the soldiers and civilians who have been defending the isolated city for more than two weeks. Commander Li replied with an impassioned tone, saying, "As long as Li Yutang is here, Yanzhou will stand!" The special plane then dropped communication bags and a letter to all the soldiers and civilians in the city and flew north after circling the city three times. The soldiers and civilians throughout the city, witnessing the Commander-in-Chief's personal visit and learning that reinforcements were arriving soon, were all overjoyed and encouraged.

The original text of Liu's letter to the soldiers and civilians of Yanzhou is as follows: "Commander Li, Division Commander Huo, and all the soldiers and civilians of Yanzhou, this time when the enemy attacked, you bravely defended the city, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, and have earned the admiration of the entire nation. At the same time, more than 100,000 enemy troops in eastern Henan have been annihilated by our forces. The enemy's momentum is gone. Our army's deployment around Yanzhou has now been completed. I, the Commander-in-Chief, have personally come to inspect, and I hope that all our soldiers and civilians will closely cooperate in combat to achieve an internal and external pincer attack and achieve an unprecedented victory. Commander-in-Chief of the Xuzhou Bandit Suppression, Liu Zhi. Noon, Jia."

### Jinan Holds Military Conference; Liu Zhi Instructs Military Officers in the Pacification Zone; Also Speaks Freely with Our Newspaper's Reporter About the Victory in Eastern Henan

[Another Dispatch] Liu Zhi met with our newspaper's reporter at the Pacification Commissioner's Office here at 1:40 PM on the afternoon of the 9th. First, he stated that the reason why this total decisive battle in eastern Henan could achieve an unprecedented victory since the start of the suppression of the rebellion was due to the consistent hard work of all officers and soldiers. He especially emphasized that this spirit of working hard to the end has been his highest principle in serving and fighting since the Northern Expedition. The enemy concentrated the main force of ten columns, originally intending to eliminate our forces in a small encirclement, but unexpectedly fell into our large encirclement and was severely annihilated between Sui and Qi. This time, the enemy originally planned a decisive battle. If they had won, they would have taken advantage of the victory to advance south to the Yangtze River. If they had failed, they would have retreated to the north bank of the Yellow River to reorganize. Now, the National Army has not only made it impossible for them to cross the river, but also impossible for them to retreat and cross the river. I have now completed a thorough deployment to ensure that the remaining main forces of the bandits who fled to Caoxian and other places in southwestern Shandong are annihilated and lay the foundation for victory on the south bank of the Yellow River.

### Harvard Professor Fairbank, a Friend of the Communist Bandits, Advocates Economic Ideas to Aid China

[United Press, New York, 9th Dispatch] Harvard University Professor John King Fairbank, a specialist on Chinese affairs, stated in his book "The United States and China" that the United States can help China achieve progress through economic and ideological assistance, without resorting to military aid.

Fairbank believes: "Our strategy must first maintain China's independence. Therefore, the second step must be to establish liberalism—individual freedom and individual protection—to counter the totalitarianism of a police state. Third, we must provide rapid and wise land reform and promotion through economic assistance to prevent peasant rebellions." "The long-term goal of American aid to China must be to modernize the lives of the Chinese people, enough to raise their living standards, thereby limiting their population growth."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th Dispatch] Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, together with Henan elder statesman General Zhang Fang and legislator Yang Yifeng, jointly hosted a press conference at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 9th, issuing a written statement on their inspection of the bandit atmosphere and relief situation in Kaifeng, and making supplementary explanations verbally. When reporting on the Kaifeng disaster, all three emphasized that the rumors that "Kaifeng has been razed to the ground and that the casualties are in the tens of millions" are definitely not true. Zhang Fang, in his capacity as a native of Henan, said that the people of Henan have suffered greatly from the communist bandits and have suffered significant losses, but there are still some people who do not understand the truth and are using the sacrifices of the people of Henan to promote the communist bandits, and there are even people who are praising the communist bandits, which is truly an injustice to the people of Henan.

Yang also pointed out that the current difficulties encountered in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou are: (1) shortage of food, (2) shortage of cash (when Kaifeng fell, the Central Bank had 1.1 trillion legal tender, all of which was robbed by the bandits), (3) commerce cannot be restored, (4) the supply of military grain and provisions is difficult to bear, (5) education is on the verge of bankruptcy, etc., and he hopes that public opinion will make more appeals.

### Students in Beiping Petitioned Vice President Li; A Transgression of Legal Boundaries Occurred; Slogans of Sedition Were Shouted Along the Way, Fortunately Nothing Happened

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th Dispatch] The incident of students in the Northeast gathering and vandalizing the Beiping City Council has been manipulated and incited by spies and professional students, and has now taken on a different quality, resulting in actions that exceed the bounds of the law. Student unions from nine units of national and private universities in Beiping, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Teachers College, Sino-French University, Railway College, Chaoyang, North China College, and Art College, and a small number of "professional students" used the July 5 City Council incident as a pretext to incite approximately 4,000 students from various universities and exiled students from the Northeast to gather at Vice President Li's residence on Beichang Street around 10:00 AM on the morning of the 9th to petition. On the way to gathering on Beichang Street, they posted slogans and publications denouncing local leaders and shouting seditious slogans. The most important and prevalent ones were "Please severely punish the murderer Fu Zuoyi," "Blood for blood," "Shoot the murderer Fu Zuoyi," "Shoot Chen Jicheng," "Give us back the blood of the seventeen martyrs," "Oppose the government's policy of suppressing the people," etc. When petitioning at Vice President Li's residence, they used a "fatigue bombardment" tactic, with so-called "student representatives" entering Vice President Li's residence in batches, coming and going, chattering incessantly, until Vice President Li was hoarse and could no longer bear to talk, and advised them to return to school. They then took the opportunity to demand to return to school collectively, from Beichang Street, where the Vice President's residence is located, heading east on Nanchang Street, turning towards Nanchizi and Beichizi to return to Sandan Peking University, in order to achieve their purpose of destroying the temporary martial law order and staging a disguised parade. Along the way, they used a question-and-answer format, chanting in unison. On their way back to school, they distributed their pre-printed propaganda "Welcome the victorious warriors returning." From all of this, it can be proved that their purpose today is to destroy the reputation of Commander-in-Chief Fu, who is responsible for directing the bandit suppression in North China. In addition to the oral requests made to Vice President Li, they also submitted ten written requests, the most important of which were "Severely punish Fu Zuoyi," unconditionally release the students arrested in the "July 5" tragedy, "Revoke the martial law order and guarantee that martial law will not be abused in the future, so as to deprive the people of freedom of assembly, demonstration, and petition," "Immediately establish Lintong University and Lintong Middle School to accommodate all the public and private university and middle school students from the Northeast in Beiping and provide them with public funding," "Provide generous pensions to the families of the deceased students and be responsible for the medical expenses of the injured and the funeral expenses of the deceased." In the afternoon at 5:00 PM, the "professional students" held a so-called "Northeast and North China Students Protest the July 5 Tragedy Memorial and Accusation Meeting." By 6:30 PM, most of the students had become impatient with the performance they were being manipulated into and dispersed in separate groups. Throughout the day, police and soldiers were mobilized to maintain order, numbering in the thousands, and all of them were unarmed, maintaining a "do not talk back when scolded, do not fight back when hit" attitude towards the students from morning to night. Discipline was very good.

### Editorial: High and Low Prices and Availability

The rise in vegetable prices affects everyone's life. Its threat to people's livelihoods and stimulation of price increases are certainly no less than daily necessities such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt. However, the authorities never impose any control or intervention on these prices. This is not because the authorities have overlooked this point. It is because these agricultural products come from the suburbs and are difficult to store for long periods. If the authorities take drastic action and interfere excessively, vegetable vendors will inevitably become alarmed and hide their goods, which will reduce the supply and further stimulate price increases. Whenever there are consecutive days of rain or snow, vegetable prices invariably skyrocket immediately. This proves that the relationship between supply and price is very close.

The production, storage, and transportation of other goods are relatively fixed, so their inflow and outflow are not as sensitive as vegetables. However, merchants pursue profits relentlessly. Places with higher profits will naturally have the strongest attraction. Furthermore, when supply decreases and demand does not decrease, prices will rise, which is a natural law of supply and demand. Therefore, to suppress prices, there are many ways, but smoothing the inflow of goods and increasing reserves are the most effective methods. At present, increasing production is a unanimous demand of the country, and the inflow of American aid materials also gives people great excitement. The reason for this is nothing more than to increase supply so that prices can fall.

Shanghai's developed industry and commerce and convenient transportation make it a de facto warehouse for China. The size of its inventory and the strength of its supply are not only related to the economic lifeline of the city but also serve as an economic indicator for the entire country. In the past, during the period when Shanghai was occupied, the enemy and puppets implemented strict controls and blockades. Although their purpose was to seize resources by force and take them for their own use, and not to allow resources to be exhausted and easily leaked, there was also an economic effect. Now, there are more mouths to feed than there is production, and storage is becoming increasingly scarce. Factories are closing down, reducing work hours, and laying off employees everywhere. Merchants are also sighing in unison, believing that once goods are sold, they will be difficult to replenish. Under these circumstances, even without artificial methods to disperse and drain resources, I am afraid that as time goes by, there will be days when there are no goods to hoard and nothing to store.

We do not deny the intensity of the hoarding trend, nor do we deny that hoarders are fueling price increases. However, in our country, where widespread rationing and effective controls have not yet been implemented, especially when inflation cannot be stopped, it may be too idealistic to think that speculation can be eliminated and hoarding can be stopped with just a few official documents and inspections. Moreover, when the public is panicked, rumors are rampant, reserves are increasingly depleted, and morale is low, this hope may be even more illusory. Don't the authorities routinely make some announcements when they see that a certain commodity is about to run out, saying that a certain batch of goods or a certain ship is about to arrive? Isn't the ban on transporting rice and grain from this city to other places still in effect? As for the sudden ban and release of cotton cloth for export, and the restrictions on edible oil and flour, what is the purpose of these measures if not to maintain inventory and first supply the needs of this city? Ultimately, don't these official orders seem to be encouraging the city to hoard as much goods as possible, intentionally or unintentionally?

Some people believe that storing goods for too long is tantamount to monopoly and should naturally be suppressed to stabilize the market. This is correct, but the types and reasons for storage are very complex. Some are definitely deliberate hoarding to speculate on prices; some are forced to sit idle because they cannot be sold (such as cement and machinery); some have to wait for the season (such as fur, soda, and calcium carbonate); some are goods that are sold exclusively to a certain place or country and cannot be transported due to some reason (such as many export goods); and there are also relationships such as outstanding debts and mortgages that are not easy to handle quickly. If it is rigidly stipulated that any goods exceeding a certain period will be considered hoarding and speculation, and a decisive disposal will be made, it would be too inconsistent with market practices.

Some people also believe that merchants have too much inventory, which is hoarding and speculation, and strict restrictions must be imposed to adjust surpluses and shortages and stabilize market prices. This is also quite justifiable in theory. The difficulty is how to stipulate this restriction. If it is based on the amount of business for one year, as stipulated by the ministry, and it is set as a fraction of that amount, and anything exceeding this amount is considered hoarding, it would be too rigid and out of touch with reality. Because businesses have their ups and downs, and their capital varies in size. Managers also have their own strengths and abilities. Even if it is the same factory or company, why can't it expand its business from only doing 偉 great business last year to 50 billion or 100 billion this year? As long as the business is legitimate and does not engage in illegal activities, the government should not force merchants to not expand their business. Moreover, for newly established companies and factories that have no past business, what amount should be used as the standard?

Still others believe that borrowing money to purchase goods and store them, or even mortgaging them repeatedly to buy more, should not be allowed without requiring a written agreement. However, buying low and selling high is the only principle of doing business. This is also often seen in state-owned institutions and even government-controlled institutions. Why should merchants alone be blamed? Moreover, when materials are scarce and replenishment is difficult, it cannot be said that it is a legitimate way for merchants to protect themselves by purchasing as many raw materials and goods as possible. As for borrowing money to purchase goods and using goods as collateral for debts, this is a common occurrence in the business world. Various laws and regulations have never stipulated that operating funds should be limited to paid-in capital. If strict restrictions are imposed, prohibiting merchants from borrowing money to purchase goods, then what will so many commercial and financial institutions do? What kind of business will they lend to?

In short, restricting storage and investigating hoarding are originally intended to be justifiable. When they are implemented vigorously and thoroughly inspected, hoarded goods may be released one after another, temporarily stabilizing the market price. However, there are often both advantages and disadvantages, and the implementation technique is particularly problematic. After too much is released and the reserves are weak, or the restrictions are too strict and the inflow of goods is scarce, whether price increases can be curbed and the phenomenon of scarcity leading to higher prices can be avoided, following the example of the vegetable market, seems to always be a question. Moreover, there is still an abundance of idle capital, and the amount of money put out by national banks is not small. Aren't those who hold large amounts of legal tender able to take advantage of the slightly lower prices to buy in large quantities? Then hoarding is still hoarding. The only difference may be that the hoarders have been replaced! Moreover, when there are goods to hoard, the problem is still the level of prices. When there are no goods to hoard, the problem is beyond the level of prices. Someone said it well: High and low prices are one problem, and availability is another problem; and the latter's severity may be even greater than the former. This statement also seems to be quite worth pondering.

### Li Zongren Meets Foreign Reporters in Beiping, Accuses Soviet Union of Breaking Treaty, Every Word and Name in All Agreements Have Been Destroyed

[United Press International, Beiping, 9th] Vice President Li Zongren met with a UPI reporter alone on the 9th and said: All existing agreements between China and the Soviet Union, such as the 1945 Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, the Dalian-Lushun and Changchun Railway agreements, have long been abolished due to the actions of the Soviet Union itself.

When asked about his opinion on Article 3 of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, which stipulates that if either country is attacked or invaded, the two countries have an obligation to help each other, Li said: "I even doubt whether the treaty contains this article, but even if it does, it must only refer to and be limited to certain small areas such as the Northeast and Northwest. I believe that the Soviet Union has never been willing to comply with the treaty's provisions regarding its obligations. In my opinion, the Soviet Union was the first to violate the treaty in the Northeast. This alone is enough to make China lose confidence in the Soviet Union's adherence to the treaty's military mutual assistance provisions." He further said: The Soviet Union can be considered to have violated every word and every sentence of all the provisions of all agreements. The Soviet Union has never fulfilled any of the obligations it has allowed and guaranteed to do. "Any treaty must be adhered to by both parties. If one party does not fulfill its promises, then the other party has no obligation to fulfill the treaty."

[Associated Press, Beiping, 9th] Vice President Li Zongren told foreign reporters today that the situation in North China is roughly the same as it was three months ago, neither improving nor worsening. Fu Zuoyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in North China, has repeatedly requested the central government to allocate new weapons, and is expected to receive a large amount of supplies in the next three months.

### Rising Prices Restart in Wuxi and Other Places

### High Tide of Interpellations in the Taiwan Provincial Assembly: Assemblymen Demand the Resignation of the Railway Bureau Chief, Grain Administration Chief Believes No Need to Form a Grain Adjustment Committee

[Our Taipei Dispatch of the 9th] The provincial assembly continued its transportation interpellation this morning. Assemblymen were emotional. Guo Guoji, Huang Liandeng, and Lü Yongkai listed eleven reasons, demanding the railway bureau chief Lang Zhong to resign on his own accord. Lang replied: A decision should be made after the court investigation is concluded. The grain report and interpellation in the afternoon was another high tide. Hong Houlian, representing the interests of landlords, demanded that the Grain Administration purchase surplus grain from large landowners at market prices, using the excuse that no other province in the mainland has measures to purchase surplus grain from large landowners, and criticized the Grain Administration for inaccurate surveys of production costs and unclear purposes of selling surpluses, and finally requested the formation of another grain adjustment committee. Director Li replied that, in order to stabilize grain prices and safeguard the lives of Taiwanese compatriots, purchasing at market prices is not feasible and is extremely unreasonable. Although there are no purchase regulations in the mainland, there is requisition, and landlords bear 40% of their income, while in this province it is only slightly less than 18%, which cannot be said to be unfavorable. Selling surpluses subsidizes fertilizer prices, which is still returned to the rural areas for further production. There is no need to form a grain adjustment committee.

U.S. destroyers patrolling the coast of Palestine during the truce period will continue to remain in Haifa until the last United Nations personnel are evacuated to a safe location. Mr. Bunche, the first secretary assigned to the headquarters of UN mediator Bernadotte, will fly from Rhodes to Beirut on the 9th to supervise the evacuation. It is said that a small number of United Nations guards may remain in Jerusalem to carry out their tasks when negotiating the establishment of a demilitarized zone in Jerusalem. Bernadotte said in Haifa today that the Jewish side had also agreed to extend the truce for 30 days, but the Arab side had refused. The Jewish side had also agreed to extend the truce for three days to facilitate the evacuation of United Nations personnel, but this has also been rejected by the Arab side. Bernadotte expressed disappointment and regret over the imminent resumption of fighting in the Holy Land, but at the same time declared that although an agreement to not resume fighting between the two sides was not established, he would continue to work to achieve a truce in the Jerusalem area and the establishment of a demilitarized zone there. Bernadotte acknowledged that the Jewish side had agreed to establish a demilitarized zone in Jerusalem, but the Arab response was unclear and needed to be clarified. According to a Cairo dispatch, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Azzam Pasha, formally announced in Cairo on the night of the 8th that hostilities in Palestine would resume at dawn on the 9th (6:00 AM Greenwich Mean Time, 3:00 PM Shanghai Summer Time).

### Haifa and Jerusalem to be Designated as Demilitarized Zones: Arabs Demand Participation in Supervision and Prohibition of Fortifications, Transportation of Arms, and Immigration

[Reuters, Cairo, 8th] The Arab League has formally notified Bernadotte that they will order combat troops in Palestine to abide by the truce agreement in the Old City of Jerusalem. As long as the other side does not attack the Old City of Jerusalem, the Arab army will never use the Old City as a base for combat operations outside Jerusalem. Regarding the proposal to declare the port area and refinery area of Haifa as demilitarized zones, the Arab League does not object in principle, but insists that after becoming a demilitarized zone, strict prohibitions should be imposed on fortifications, offensives, and the import of immigrants, arms, and supplies. In order to achieve this goal, strict supervision should be implemented, allowing Arab representatives to participate in the supervision.

In addition, the rights of the Arab residents in the area must be guaranteed, their lives and property should be protected, and Arab refugees and workers should be allowed to freely return to their former residences in Haifa. Furthermore, the Political Committee of the Arab League held the final meeting of this session twenty-four hours before the end of the truce in the Holy Land. It is understood that the meeting discussed the issue of establishing an Arab government in the Arab-controlled areas of Palestine.

### Date of Announcement for Content of Three Powers' Note to Soviet Union Not Yet Determined: Washington, London, and Paris Maintain Contact by Telephone

[Report from Our Newspaper] Geneva, 9th, Radio: Secretary of State Marshall said today that there is no decision yet on when to announce the content of the British-American-French protest letter to the Soviet Union regarding the Berlin issue.

[United Press, Washington, 9th] It is learned today that the United States, Britain, and France have differing opinions on the announcement of their note protesting the Berlin blockade to the Soviet Union and are now seeking reconciliation. According to London diplomatic officials, an agreement has been reached through transatlantic telephone consultations between the three governments, and at least until this morning, the content of the note to the Soviet Union will not be announced temporarily. The exact date of the announcement is yet to be determined, but it will likely be within the next few days.

Britain and France are both advocating for immediate announcement for publicity purposes to prevent the Soviet Union from preemptively publishing a reply, but the U.S. Department of State believes that the situation in Berlin is extremely serious, and the publicity issue is only secondary. Hasty announcement may prevent the Soviet Union from making a favorable reply and cause the Western countries to bear the ill repute of obstructing a solution.

[Associated Press, London, 8th] According to well-informed sources, the United States, Britain, and France have suggested to the Soviet Union to reopen all negotiations on the Berlin issue if the Soviet Union immediately lifts the blockade of Berlin. The suggestion by the United States, Britain, and France to negotiate the overall situation in Berlin is included in the notes sent separately to the Soviet Union by the three countries on the 6th. The note also reiterates the right of the Western Allies to share the occupation of Berlin. The United States, Britain, and France have decided not to be forced out of Berlin by Soviet threats, as Berlin is in fact an international zone and not part of the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. Also, the suggestion for the four powers to reopen Berlin negotiations is expected to be supported by the commanders-in-chief of the four powers' occupation forces in Germany and does not require the foreign ministers of the four powers to participate.

[Reuters, London, 9th] A British Foreign Office spokesman said today that Britain has again appealed to the Arab countries to agree to extend the truce in Palestine.

(2) After the above warehouse receipts are replaced, each warehouse (godown) shall stamp the returned warehouse receipts with a rubber stamp bearing the words "Replaced with new receipt, void" and submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification. Those who fail to replace the warehouse receipts by the deadline shall have the warehouse (godown) list the warehouse receipt number, name of the stored goods, quantity, storage date, name of the owner, address, and other information and report it through the Chamber of Commerce for Warehouses or the relevant commercial guilds of banks, trusts, and docks, which shall be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for verification.

The owners may submit their supporting documents to the municipal government for verification at any time and have their deposits returned after verification. (4) Hereafter, anyone who opens an account with a warehouse (godown) to deposit goods shall fill out a seal card. If the account name is not a company, factory, or business number, or if there is no company license, factory registration certificate, or business registration certificate number, the warehouse (godown) shall refuse to store the goods.

C. Statistical spot checks and handling: (1) Based on the bi-weekly reports of each warehouse (godown), the Social Affairs Bureau shall statistically compile the total quantity of designated goods stored in the city on a bi-weekly basis and report it to the municipal government for record. Anyone who fails to file the report within the deadline shall be requested by the municipal government for sealing up and the Social Affairs Bureau will dispatch personnel with relevant authorities for inspection and handling. (2) Any goods found to have no seal card and unregistered or not registered, will be regarded as hoarding and profiteering, and the warehouse (godown) will be given the appropriate punishment.

If they fail to comply, the market may be entrusted to sell them off, and the proceeds will still be handed over to the owner. (4) If a non-industry person or a merchant not engaged in the industry purchases and stores designated goods, the Social Affairs Bureau shall report to the municipal government for approval and entrust the market to sell them off. In addition to a fine, they shall be sent to the court for handling. (5) When industry merchants hoard a large quantity of designated goods, the Social Affairs Bureau may, depending on the needs of the market, order them to sell part or all of them on the market. If they fail to comply, the Social Affairs Bureau shall request the municipal government to sell them on their behalf. The aforementioned "large quantity," in addition to kerosene, newsprint, and rough-edged paper, which are stipulated to be one-fourth of the annual sales volume, shall be handled in accordance with the Regulations for the Implementation of the Measures for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities during Extraordinary Times (the measures are attached separately).

C. The self-provided warehouses (godowns) of companies, factories, and businesses shall not store the following items, otherwise they will be deemed to be hoarding: goods of others, raw materials that are not the sales products or finished products of the company. D. If a company, factory, business, or individual has a warehouse (godown) to store goods but conceals the information, any citizen may report it. If it is found that they have violated the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of the Measures for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities during Extraordinary Times and the provisions of Items 2 and 3 of the Implementation Notes of the original measures, a reward will be given in accordance with the provisions of Article 21 of the Measures for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities during Extraordinary Times.

Those who operate a warehouse (godown) business and have obtained the aforementioned registration license but have not legally joined the Chamber of Commerce for Warehouses will be given a deadline to join the association. Those who still fail to join the association after the deadline will be given a suspension of business, and will still be ordered to join the association. If they still resist and fail to join the association, the Social Affairs Bureau may send a letter to the Public Works Bureau to revoke their above-mentioned registration license and order them to cease business. C. If a citizen reports that the designated goods stored in the above two types of warehouses (godowns) violate the provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of the Measures for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities during Extraordinary Times and the provisions of Items 2 and 3 of the Implementation Notes of the original measures, they will be deemed to be hoarding and profiteering and a reward will be given according to the rules.

(2) The company may collect the increase in the deposit in one or two installments at its discretion. (3) The collection of deposits from new users shall be calculated based on the unit price of the month of use and the estimated monthly usage.

### Reduced Automotive Fuel Quota; Three Restriction Measures are Set

[Our Reporter] Because the city's gasoline quota has been ordered to be reduced, the Public Works Bureau believes that the original method for registering and distributing gasoline to vehicles should be changed. The Public Works Bureau put forward three opinions, which were passed by the Municipal Government Meeting yesterday: (1) In principle, the registration and issuance of licenses for new vehicles will be stopped.

### Whereabouts of the Haitain Wheel; No Report for Five Days

Jianghe Wheel Docked in Hong Kong for Repairs

[Our Reporter] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haitain Wheel sailed directly from Keelung to Japan on the 5th of this month. As of yesterday evening, there had been no report for five days. Wireless communication was also impossible, and its whereabouts are unknown.

[Also News] The bureau's Jianghe Wheel, on the Han-Yu line, loaded passengers and cargo on the 2nd of this month from Hankou and sailed upstream. On the 5th, it passed Yichang. Unexpectedly, on the river below Xiangkou upstream of Yichang, it suddenly ran aground on a reef, and the bottom of the ship was punctured, allowing river water to enter.

After extracting the water, the puncture was temporarily filled with cement, and they sailed to Xiangkou to find a way to repair it.

### Small Couple's Relationship Falls Apart; Civil Servant's Disappearance Becomes a Mystery: Liu Chuanpu Missing for Two Months

[Our Newspaper's Report] Another mysterious disappearance case has recently occurred in this city, the details of which are quite tortuous and bizarre. The missing person is Liu Chuanpu, a 27-year-old native of Changle, Fujian, a graduate of National Xiamen University, and currently an engineer at the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. The date of disappearance was early May. Liu left the Shanghai office dormitory of the Tang-Zhan Engineering Bureau on Gordon Road and has been missing ever since. His brother, Chuanpeng, a supervisor at the Taiwan Provincial Cooperative Business Management Committee, rushed to Shanghai after receiving the news. His younger brother, Chuanzhan, who is studying at Jinan University, has placed missing person advertisements in various newspapers and reported the case to the Jiangning Branch of the Police Bureau, requesting an investigation.

The key to Liu Chuanpu's disappearance lies in the unfortunate breakdown of his marriage. Liu became engaged to Wu Shuhui, a graduate of the Normal College and fellow villager, in 1943, and they married in Shanghai in August 1947. After the marriage, Liu returned to Tanggu alone for work, while Wu remained in Shanghai at the home of her cousin, Wu Chuanzhi. Since then, separated by distance, their longing could not alleviate their loneliness. Wu's feelings for Liu gradually changed, eventually leading her to request a divorce. According to Liu's brother, Chuanpeng, after Liu went to work in Tang-Zhan, he repeatedly tried to bring his wife north, but Wu refused, using the instability in the north as an excuse.

Identity Card, Clothing, and Money: Nothing Taken at the Time of Departure

Liu came to Shanghai in February of this year, but Wu abruptly returned to Fuzhou to avoid him. Liu had no choice but to return north to Tanggu. In mid-April, his father-in-law, Liu Yang, celebrated a major birthday, and Liu wanted to take this opportunity to return to Fujian to offer his congratulations, but Wu strongly opposed it. Liu, because his wife made excuses that there were many troubles in the north and was unwilling to go to Tanggu, in order to seek family reunion, planned to work in Taiwan, and came to Shanghai at the end of April. Unexpectedly, Wu suddenly requested a divorce. Liu refused. On May 4, a conflict arose during an argument between the two, and Liu beat his wife, injuring her eye, and she was treated at the Sino-American Hospital. That evening, Liu still returned to the dormitory. According to the tea server, Liu left the dormitory at 8:30 the next morning and never returned. His identity card, resume, documents, clothing, money, etc., were all left in the room and he took nothing with him. However, his father-in-law received a distress telegram in Fuzhou on May 4 and came to Shanghai on the 6th. He said that on the morning of May 7, he even went to the dormitory to invite Liu to meet with him, and then Liu said he was going out to find a lawyer, and has been missing since. So, when did Liu disappear? This has become a mystery.

Suspected Murder

His brother, Chuanpeng, believes that Liu did not take any money or documents with him, so he would not have traveled far. If it was suicide, why haven't his remains been found by the police, in hotels, or in the river, nor has he left a suicide note? Therefore, he suspects it was murder, and who the murderer is, he alleges that his sister-in-law "has another love interest," and because the divorce was not granted and she was beaten, she harbored resentment and there must be someone behind the scenes plotting. He pointed out why, after Liu's disappearance, Wu did not immediately report to the police station or publish a missing person advertisement, and why she didn't send a telegram to Chuanpeng on the day of the incident, but waited until Liu's father-in-law returned to Fujian on May 15 before sending a letter inviting him to discuss the matter. Reporter yesterday interviewed Liu's wife, Wu Shuhui, at her mother's home. Wu was calm and collected. She said that the breakdown of her relationship with Liu did not begin after they separated. Initially, Wu and Liu's sister-in-law were classmates, and that's how they met. At that time, Wu was still young, and her father was very fond of Liu, so they got engaged just ten days after meeting. After the marriage, Wu felt that Liu's personality was stubborn and dictatorial, and since he had gone to the north, Wu felt that "if marriage is only for eating, then not getting married can also find something to do," so "it's better to get a divorce."

Questioned Twice: No Results

When Liu came to Shanghai in February, Wu proposed a divorce. At that time, Liu agreed and wrote a note, which included the phrases "Both parties have incompatible opinions and it is difficult to grow old together. From this day forward, the divorce is unconditional. After this, I will not interfere with any of Wu's actions." (This note is now considered one of the suspicious points by Liu's brother, because the date was not filled in at the end, the seal has an 　　mark added to it, and the name of the witness was filled in and then crossed out with ink.) The reporter asked why Liu agreed to a divorce in February, but this time when he came to Shanghai, he argued with Wu and even beat her. Wu replied that she did not know the reason. She also said that Liu never told her where his relatives and friends were, and after he disappeared, she thought he was staying at a friend's house, so she was not in a hurry to look for him. The reporter asked if she felt sad that Liu was now missing. Wu said that until his whereabouts are clear, getting emotional is superfluous. She also said that Liu may have gone to another place, and that the advertisements placed in the newspaper by his brothers contain many things that are not true about her.

This case is now being handled by the Jiangning Police Station, which has questioned Wu Shuhui and Xu Zhishan, the tea server at the engineering bureau's dormitory, twice, but has yielded no results. It is feared that it will be difficult to solve the case for the time being.

### Public Buses Resume Service; Fired Drivers and Ticket Sellers; Xin Is Willing to Accept Severance Pay; Procedures for Receiving Payments to be Processed Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] The strike wave caused by the leave-without-pay policy for 197 ticket sellers and drivers of the Municipal Public Transportation Company escalated to an extreme state by about 3 a.m. yesterday, before taking a sharp turn for the better. The workers accepted the advice of Director Zhao Zengjue and withdrew from the company's employee welfare association on Fair Road, details of which were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. At 6 a.m., buses on various lines successively left the factory and resumed service. Although Lines 9 and 10 were temporarily suspended at around 10 a.m., they were quickly restored after persuasion from the authorities. By the afternoon, vehicles on all lines had fully returned to normal.

As for the dismissed drivers and ticket sellers, the company decided on two options: (1) Those willing to accept leave without pay will be given two months' severance pay, calculated according to the June cost of living index, and the bonuses from July 1 to 7 will be paid as calculated. (2) The company has expressed its acceptance in principle of the workers' proposal that senior workers voluntarily forgo two days of wage increases each month to subsidize new workers, but all senior workers must sign a guarantee, to be completed within three days. New and old workers started signing yesterday. However, there were already more than forty people who were willing to accept leave without pay, and today they will go through the procedures for receiving payments. The signing by old workers to give up two days of wage increases is not going smoothly, and there is a lot of disagreement among the old workers. Few are willing to sign. Some of the dismissed new workers also stated that they are unwilling to have the problems of a small number of them reduce the income of all old workers. It is expected that the majority of those willing to accept severance pay will be the majority today. According to Director Zhao, if the source of gasoline is resolved in the future, and the company's plan to open two new lines, 16 and 18, is realized, then this group of drivers and ticket sellers can be recalled and continue to be given work.

### Sixteen Magazines Suspend Publication for One Issue to Protest Unreasonable Increase in Airmail Rates; Decision to Send Representatives to Petition in the Capital

[Our Newspaper's Report] The magazine industry in this city, in order to protest the unreasonable measures taken by the post office regarding domestic newspapers in the increase of airmail postage, yesterday received reporters at the Tsinghua Alumni Association, painfully pointing out that the magazine industry is currently suffering from various difficulties and is almost on the verge of collapse. After this increase in airmail postage, the postage for newspapers is twice that of ordinary letters, that is, for every twenty centimeters, it has increased from 10,000 yuan to 60,000 yuan. According to this regulation, sending one magazine by airmail would require postage of 120,000 yuan, which has actually exceeded the selling price of the magazine itself. This will undoubtedly increase a major burden on readers and will also be a major blow to the magazine industry in the future. For the sake of protest, three measures have been decided as follows: (1) Two representatives will be sent to the capital to petition the relevant authorities. (2) Forty-six magazines will jointly publish a protest declaration. (3) Sixteen weekly and semi-monthly publications have decided to suspend publication for one issue, starting today, to show their protest.

It is understood that the sixteen publications that will be suspended are Bank Weekly, Observation, New Road, Industry and Commerce World, Municipal Review, Textile Weekly, Times, Outlook, National Glory English, Reconstruction Review, World Knowledge, Youth Life, Economic Review, Digest, etc.

### Post Office Statement: Price Increase Entirely Passive

[Another Report] According to the person in charge of the Municipal Postal Administration yesterday, the increase in airmail postage was based on the adjustment of freight rates by the airline, and the post office was entirely in a passive position. Previously, the airline charged the post office the same rate for letters and printed matter. As for bulk-mailed newspapers, it was charged at 60% of the preferential rate for airmail books and small packages. This time, the airline increased prices, in addition to generally increasing freight rates by 180%, it also adjusted the base, with printed matter being double the rate of letters (the preferential method for newspapers remains the same), so the post office had no choice but to appropriately increase the airmail postage for printed matter. As for the method of charging for letters under 20 centimeters and charging for books and small packages for those over 20 centimeters, it has long been abolished and is not applicable.

### Claiming to Introduce Work; Extortion of Money Exposed and Investigated

[Our Newspaper's Report] Li Jianhua, a 25-year-old from Hangzhou, recently had a whimsical idea. He falsely created titles and used the introduction of jobs as bait to lure unemployed workers to extort activity fees. The number of victims reached more than fifty. As a result, the deception was exposed and he was arrested and sent to the police station. Li lives in a three-story attic at No. 16, Lane 827, Jiaozhou Road. Recently, out of extreme boredom, he started activities on the 8th of last month, claiming to be the "General Manager of Jianhua Coal Company," "Deputy General Manager of Lida Trading Company," and "Section Chief of the Personnel Section of Tiansheng Tobacco Company," and falsely claimed that he knew all 99 warehouses in this city and that there would be no problem introducing work. At that time, an unemployed person from northern Jiangsu named Song Yutian heard this and believed it to be true, so he contacted him. Li saw an opportunity and asked Song to find a team and enticed him to let him serve as a foreman when he worked in the future. After Song found more than 50 unemployed workers from various places, Li indicated that each person had to pay an activity fee of 6 million yuan before he could actively work. Song and others did not suspect him and immediately agreed to pay 3 million yuan first, and the other half would be paid after the job was found. Unexpectedly, after Li obtained this money, he avoided meeting them. Only then did Song and others realize that they had been deceived. According to a report, the Jiangning Road Police Station arrested Li, who confessed to defrauding money. The bureau has now transferred Li to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation.

### Rice Stored in Warehouse Exceeds Time Limit; Guo Guixuan Indicted

[Our Newspaper's Report] Guo Guixuan, a 42-year-old rice merchant from Hebei, loaded 900 bags of rice from Hankou onto the Tianyi Wheel on February 24 of this year and stored it in the Litai Warehouse. By May 7, he sold 500 bags of it to a rice store on Shunchang Road, and recently planned to load the remaining 400 bags onto a wheel to be transported to Tianjin for sale. However, the customs authorities, based on the Food Control Regulations, stipulated that if rice from other places arrives in Shanghai and has not been shipped out after more than one month, it will be regarded as hoarding, so customs clearance for export was not allowed. This matter was subsequently detected by the Economic Police, who arrested Guo and sent him to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. Now that the investigation has been completed, Guo has been prosecuted on suspicion of hoarding and profiteering.

### Falsely Establishing Cotton Cloth Store; Eleven Victims; Total Amount Defrauded Exceeds 7 Billion; Three Perpetrators Arrested Confess Everything

They were all arrested yesterday and taken to the bureau for interrogation. They confessed the truth and were detained awaiting transfer to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### British Union Shipyard: Confiscated Smuggled Goods Evading Taxes; Worth Hundreds of Billions

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the dance hall case, the dancers Yang Lili and Li Ping were previously detained by the Special Criminal Court at the Huangpu Police Station. A rogue named Du Ami falsely claimed to the families of Yang and others that he had a way to get Yang and others released, and successively swindled a lot of "activity fees" and gold jewelry. After Yang and others were released by the District Court, they realized they had been deceived, so they filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office accusing Du of fraud. This case was interrogated by Prosecutor Ding Chuanen, who took the company into custody, and after further interrogation yesterday, ordered it to be returned to custody.

### 川康 Border Region - Suppressing the Black Yi

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Ouyang Chun

[This Newspaper Chongqing, 6th Dispatch] Gan Yu Gumu Gan'er (full name), who grew up in Ebian, is a Black Yi universally known in the Sichuan-Kang border region. He is strong and astute, acts cautiously, and is always accompanied by fifty to sixty armed attendants. Whenever he arrives at a location, he maintains strict vigilance and does not linger in any place for long. Commissioner Liu led troops to fight him for half a year, and to this day, not a single officer or soldier has ever caught sight of Mu Gan'er himself. This Black Yi leader, who is only twenty-four years old, already privately owned over eighty rifles, four light machine guns, and a group of over eight hundred Yi people, eight hundred rifles, and over one hundred thousand rounds of ammunition from Mu Jia Camp and Zongzi Mountain by the end of last year. In case of any emergencies, he can also mobilize over four hundred Yi people with guns from the Greater Liang Mountains for support (Note 1). The five counties of Leshan, Emei, Muchuan, Ebian, and Mabian in western Sichuan have suffered from Mu Gan'er's harassment because Mu Gan'er has been forcibly planting opium seedlings and harboring fugitives over the years, greatly impacting the security of southwestern Sichuan and the Sichuan-Kang border region. Yi people are good at climbing mountains, can fight independently, endure cold and last for a long time, do not need supplies, and are skilled at shooting. Therefore, before Commissioner Liu urgently telegraphed a report to the Headquarters, Mu Gan'er had already occupied Yaya Creek, Huaqiu Zao, Tea Garden, Dahuo Di, Laoying Yan, Zhangjia Shan, and Mu Jia Camp in Ebian, up to the edge of Tuan Yan, and also seized Shibei Gang, Jin Yan Creek, Baila Ping, and Shisun Ping. According to those who participated in the battle, all key strongholds in the Yi area are fortified with protective works that cannot be destroyed by small cannons. The troops also have organized battalions, companies, and platoons, and some even wear military uniforms.

The Sichuan Provincial Government mobilized the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Provincial Security First Regiment, the 5th District Security Police Battalion, the Ebian County Township Police Battalion, the Leshan and Muchuan County Police Squadrons, and Abull self-reformed Yi soldiers.

They joined forces to suppress them and utilized the Linchangzi Reclamation Cooperative (Note 2) and the power of Zhou Ze and Yin Hongjun (Note 3) to quell the Mu Gan'er Incident. The following is an excerpt from the report of the Commander-in-Chief Liu Ren'an at the time, to glimpse the course of the battle:

"The headquarters was set up in Shaping, and the forces were divided into three routes. The central route was commanded by Li Long, the commander of the 1st Regiment of the Provincial Security Force, with a force of about six companies. The left wing was commanded by Jin Anren, the commander of the 5th District Security Battalion, with about five companies. The right wing was led by He Zhengming, the magistrate of Ebian County, with two companies. The bandits resisted stubbornly, relying on their dangerous terrain. After fierce fighting, the Yi people were unable to withstand and retreated. The central route successively occupied Yaya Creek, Huanglian Gang, Yanwo Zi, and Mi Jia Shan. The left wing occupied Shizi Yan, Zhangjia Shan, Mu Jia Camp, Zhutou Shan, and Laoying Yan. The right wing, due to the difficult terrain, with steep cliffs, virgin forests, and temperatures below zero, and snow several feet deep, eventually occupied Xindian Zi, Heishan Gou, and Shisun Ping. However, because the Provincial Security Team delayed its attack due to resolving winter cotton clothing and transporting grain, the climate changed drastically, with ice and snow everywhere, and Mu Gan'er was able to escape (Note 4). Afterwards, over a hundred Bai Yi families sent representatives, Ma Fuhua and others, to surrender to me, voluntarily handing over rifles. The entire campaign resulted in the killing of four bandit leaders, fifty bandit followers, wounding fifty bandits, capturing one bandit leader, one hundred and thirty-one bandits, self-reforming five bandit leaders, and seven hundred bandits. We lost two officers, seventeen soldiers, wounded seven officers, forty-three soldiers, and had soldiers go missing."

### Mobile Capital Pours In, Money Supply Loosens, Prices of Daily Necessities Increase Across the Board, National Banking Institutions Experienced Huge Deficit Yesterday

[This Newspaper] The prices of goods have been slightly stable for the past few days, and although the prices of daily necessities have increased, the momentum is still slow. However, as of yesterday, the prices of daily necessities and financial commodities have increased across the board again. National banking institutions experienced a deficit of more than one trillion yesterday, and mobile capital from all over the country continued to flock to Shanghai, causing the money supply in the market to loosen. In addition, rumors of the issuance of large banknotes spread in the market, further stimulating people's hearts. The prices of rice, grain, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, etc. increased by an average of 10% to 20%, and Huagu (Chinese stocks) also had strong buying interest, with prices rising by 10% to 20%. Given yesterday's price situation, unless the authorities can take effective measures soon, another price surge will occur.

[This Newspaper] Yesterday, the prices of goods increased across the board, and news of the imminent issuance of large banknotes spread in the market, which greatly stimulated people's hearts. The silver and money industry also believes that the market's need for cash is urgent, and the national bank's inventory is not enough to cope, so large banknotes must be issued, and the time is very near. However, according to Deputy Director Chen of the Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, the Central Bank has not received an issuance order, and all rumors are completely inaccurate.

In addition: Yesterday, the trend of money supply in this city was loose and abundant, and the hidden interest rate in the market declined, and the price increase was quite severe. The four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury experienced a huge deficit in the bill exchange of the silver and money industry, totaling 1045.1 billion. Among them, the Central Bank had a deficit of 97 billion, the Bank of China had a deficit of 816.6 billion, the Bank of Communications had a surplus of 83.9 billion, the Farmers Bank had a deficit of 246.1 billion, the CITIC Bureau had a deficit of 40.6 billion, the Postal Savings Bureau had a deficit of 48.3 billion, the Central Cooperative Treasury had a surplus of 32.3 billion, the commercial banks and financial institutions had a large exchange surplus of 1027.6 billion, a small exchange deficit of 540 billion, and foreign banks had a total surplus of 557.5 billion. It is said that the largest deficit of the Bank of China yesterday was due to the payment of funds from outports to Shanghai.

### Food Grain Transactions Halted, Off-Site Bidding Soars, White Rice Goes for 23.5 Million Yuan

Rice prices in Wuxi production areas continue to rise, creating deep panic and causing prices to rise further. However, price limits remain the same, so transactions within the market are even scarcer. Only inferior indica rice is still being traded within the price limits. Off-site, both white rice and thin rice are being traded for 23.5 million, medium-grade rice is being traded for 23 million, and early rice is also reaching 22 million. The supply of high-quality rice is very small, and the price also reaches 23.5 million, an increase of 1.5 million compared to the previous day. The total amount of grain arriving at the two markets was 5,541 shi.

Due to high prices in the interior and rising raw material costs, flour factories have also raised their supply prices to 7.47 million yuan (including military donation). The allocated quantity is still 7,540 bags. Off-site prices were affected by the factory price and the upward trend was even more intense. The price of Laoche and Bingshun once reached 8 million, but later fell slightly. Laoche and Bingshun each closed at 7.75 million, and miscellaneous flour was also traded off-site. Wheat bran was quoted at 5 million, and wheat broke the 10 million mark, trading at 10.5 million.

The prices of miscellaneous grains rose, but fearing the intervention of the authorities, the cargo owners watched and dared not quote a price, so transactions were scarce. The industry once proposed to set the price of Zhadou at 11.5 million and Chedou at 12.5 million, but before it was approved, it could not be traded rashly, so it was not quoted. Only small amounts of Zhuan Dou, Broad Beans, and a few Du Dou and Green Beans were quoted. The price of Green Beans rose by 1 million, and the price of Broad Beans rose by 500,000. There were no transactions in Sesame and Raw Peanuts.

Edible oil prices cannot rise due to price limits, but the market situation is extremely tight, and no one is willing to sell at the price limits, resulting in unresolved transactions. Later, the industry drafted the lowest cost, with raw peanut oil at 67 million and bean oil at 49 million, but it must be submitted to the mayor for approval, so the price was not quoted yesterday and the market remained halted. Only small-sized Giktong sesame oil was traded at 65 million, an increase of 4.5 million. Secondary-sale barrel of cooked vegetable oil was traded at 45 million, net cooked vegetable oil at 43 million. At the early market for bean cake, 500 pieces of May cake were quoted at 4.8 million, and no further quotes were made in the afternoon market.

### Strengthening Control of the Gauze Market: Authorities Announce Six Measures

[Report from this Newspaper] Following the authorities' intensified measures to stabilize prices, the situation in the fabric market has indeed improved. Market brokers are cooperating earnestly, adhering to the three directives from the Garrison Headquarters.

The inspectors stationed at the Yarn Control Committee and relevant personnel from the Garrison Headquarters recently invited Chairman Chen of the Cotton Fabric Guild Brokers Association to discuss six supplementary measures to achieve twice the result with half the effort.

The content includes: (1) The transaction books of each broker will be replaced with new books issued by the Association (each book starting from number one). (2) Before leaving the market each day after closing, each broker must submit their transaction book to the Association for verification, regardless of whether there were any transactions. They can then collect it for use the following morning. (3) Each broker must prepare a small notepad to record daily transactions for calculating commissions. After use, the original notepad should be submitted to the Association for inspection by the relevant authorities at any time. (4) Brokers are not allowed to carry any blank slips of paper to prevent the recording of illegal transactions. (5) The names of both buyers and sellers written on the transaction slip must match those recorded in the membership directory. (6) The "Remarks" column of the transaction slip should be specifically filled with the buyer's address. The seller's address may only be noted on the back of the buyer's copy. These supplementary measures are being implemented gradually, and it is hoped that illegal transactions can be eliminated.

### Strong Buying Sentiment: All Chinese Stocks Hit Limit Up

Chinese stocks initially stabilized and then became popular yesterday. People were optimistic, and excessive liquidity, coupled with rising prices of tangible goods, reignited the bullish trend. After 11:00 AM, buying interest suddenly became exceptionally strong, and nearly half of the stocks hit the limit up by noon.

### Local and Outside Buyers Actively Purchasing: Gauze Prices Soar

Yesterday's cotton yarn market initially delayed opening due to uncertain sentiment. However, after 11:00 AM, after the release of those arrested on bail, trading activity resumed. Local processing factories actively replenished their inventories, and outside buyers were also aggressively purchasing, leading to a firm market. Later, news of a soaring stock market and easing credit conditions caused widespread price increases. Both local and outside buyers became even more eager to purchase, and buying sentiment strengthened, causing the market to rise steadily. Under the close supervision of the authorities, there was no speculative atmosphere. However, the market still felt sluggish.

Very little trading occurred in 42s and 40s fine yarns. It was reported that 42s "Blue Phoenix" yarn broke the 1 billion yuan mark, rising straight to a peak of 1.3 billion yuan, a sharp increase of 320 million yuan compared to the previous day.

There was a larger amount of trading in 20s "Tiannu" yarn, initially quoted at 800 million yuan, but all buyers competed to purchase, causing the market to rise again. However, users were constrained by credit conditions, and most transactions were for next-day delivery, with the highest price reaching 900 million yuan.

The prices of coarser yarns such as 16s and 10s initially remained flat before rising, with overall gains ranging from 50 to 100 million yuan. A total of 52 transaction slips were recorded for the day, totaling 222 bales of fine yarn.

Yesterday's cotton market saw the influx of speculative funds and a sudden easing of credit conditions. New buyers were actively purchasing, and remittances from North China arrived. The Tianjin buyers were eager to purchase, and Sichuan buyers were also busy absorbing at lower prices, using funds remitted from previous sales. Traders within the industry were also actively purchasing, leading to a bullish market.

### Green Tea Exports Weaken

Yesterday's tea market saw sellers eager to unload their inventory in the morning, leading to successive declines. However, due to acceptable domestic sales of Qimen Chen Hua Xiang and broken red tea, prices eventually rose again. As for green tea, which is mainly exported, the trend weakened instead of rising. It was rumored among industry insiders that a certain location in North Africa had a large inventory of tea. Although there are plans to purchase, they are attempting to suppress prices. Consequently, owners who had been profiting became uneasy and frequently sold off their inventory, causing prices to decline. However, according to general opinion, with the need to process and refine the tea for consumption, it is predicted that the future will be stable.

### Timber Market Conditions Vary

### National Tennis Committee Established, First Batch of Nineteen Members Appointed by the Sports Association

Hao Gengsheng, Secretary-General of the National Sports Association, and Zhao Minheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Sports and Youth Association Tennis Committee, jointly invited tennis enthusiasts in this city to a meeting at the Xinya Restaurant on Nanjing Road at 7:00 PM on the day before yesterday (8th). Huang Shaohong, Xu Chongzhi, Li Shuming, Xu Zhendong, Xu Guogang, Shi Yonggeng, Liu Nianyi, Li Leishi, Wu Bangwei, Yu Zhizhong, Lu Chunbo, and others attended the meeting. Hao Gengsheng served as chairman, and Jiang Huaiqing served as the recorder. This meeting formally established the National Tennis Committee and approved the candidates for the first batch of members, who will be appointed by the National Sports Association. The details are as follows:

Secretary-General Hao Reports on the Process

(A) Report Matters: First, Chairman Hao Gengsheng reported on the significance of organizing the National Tennis Committee, stating: Based on the resolution of the Board of Directors, I have contacted President Wang Zhengting of the National Sports Association several times, and we believe that to revive sports in China and improve the technical level of various sports, there must be a national independent organization for each sport, under the jurisdiction of the National Sports Association, specifically responsible for promoting and advancing the work in each department. Currently, the plan is to first organize the national organizations for tennis, soccer, and basketball. Especially in the area of tennis, thanks to Mr. Zhao Minheng's efforts in planning and the enthusiastic support of everyone present, it will be the first to be established. I recently went to various parts of Southeast Asia for inspections, and the overseas Chinese are also very supportive. Today's meeting is the first preparatory meeting, also the establishment meeting, of the National Tennis Committee. This is a major event in the Chinese sports world. The soccer and basketball organizations will be organized after I return from attending the World Games. As for the selection of members, after obtaining the consent of everyone, the National Sports Association will send appointment letters. The selection of members from other units will be added later. It is hoped that after the establishment of the Committee, it will focus on international tennis competitions and communication, as well as national tennis competitions and promotion matters, especially emphasizing the training of young people. It is hoped that in ten years, Chinese players will be able to reach the finals in the Davis Cup. Thank you for your presence and help.

Zhao Minheng then reported: Mr. Hao Gengsheng contacted me after the National Games to discuss the issue of organizing a national tennis organization. I immediately contacted tennis enthusiasts in this city informally, and they were all optimistic and supportive. It is believed that China lacks tennis talent, and in order to popularize and develop the sport and cultivate outstanding talent, there must be an independent organization to promote it in a planned manner. In the past, the Shanghai tennis community lacked organization and even more so lacked complete venue facilities, making promotion work very difficult. Therefore, this year we are determined to build a relatively complete tennis club, which is currently under construction and will be completed and opened by the end of this month. It is hoped that the National Tennis Committee will be affiliated with this newly built club. It is hoped that this new club will not only be the general headquarters of the Shanghai tennis community, but also become the general headquarters of the national tennis community. With the combination of human and geographical advantages, I believe that China's tennis future is not without hope.

Passage of First Batch of Member List

(B) Discussion Matters: The discussion and exchange of opinions then began, resolving: (1) The list of candidates for the National Tennis Committee members was approved. The first batch consists of 19 people, who will be appointed by the National Sports Association. Members from overseas Chinese regions such as the Philippines and Malaysia, as well as other important provinces and cities, will be appointed after the candidates from each unit are determined. The list of the first batch of members is as follows: Huang Shaohong, Xu Chongzhi, Ma Yuehan, Hao Gengsheng, Diao Zuqian, Cai Huihong, Qiu Zuorong, Hang Chen Yuemei, Li Shuming, Xu Guogang, Xu Bandong, Shi Yonggeng, Guan Shengfu, Li Leishi, Liu Nianyi, Chen Chunbo, Yu Zhizhong, Wu Bangwei, Zhao Minheng. (2) Committee Member Zhao Minheng was appointed as Honorary Secretary-General. (3) The headquarters will be located in Shanghai. (4) The first plenary meeting of the National Tennis Committee will be held at the next National Games. (5) Secretary-General Zhao was requested to draft the constitution of the National Tennis Committee.

### School Introduction: Overview of National Fudan University

1. History

[Our Special Visit] The predecessor of Fudan University was the Aurora College, founded by Mr. Ma Xiangbo in the spring of the ninth year before the Republic of China. At that time, the remaining rooms of the Xujiahui Observatory were used as college buildings, and foreign missionaries were hired as volunteer professors. Mr. Ma served as the supervisor. All affairs within the college were managed by the students, fostering a spirit of autonomy. The subjects offered were four types: linguistics, mathematics, physics, and epistemology. The teaching method aimed to stimulate students' free research. Two years later, when the spring semester began, there was a conflict of authority between foreign professors and the college due to the student payment issue, resulting in the dispersal of students. Therefore, they abandoned the old and sought the new. Soon, they heard from Governor Zhou Fu of Jiangsu, who telegraphed the Shanghai Daotai to allocate a loan and land to transfer and build temporary school buildings in Wusong. The school name was changed to Fudan, meaning "restoring Aurora." In August of that year, it was formally established, with Mr. Ma serving as the president and Dr. Li Denghui as the provost. Thus, Aurora College transformed into Fudan Public School, which is the predecessor of the current Fudan University.

Two years later, Mr. Ma was ordered to go to Japan, and Yan Fu succeeded him as the president. By the time of the Xinhai Revolution, the Wusong school buildings were occupied by the Song Army, and the public school was interrupted. At the beginning of the Republic of China, Mr. Ma and the alumni association conspired to restore the school with the help of Chen Ying Shidu, and the Li Gong Temple in Xujiahui was designated as the school building, and classes were resumed. In the second year of the Republic of China, Dr. Li Denghui succeeded him as the president and was determined to reform. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, it was reorganized into a university, and the scale was expanded. Mr. Li personally went to various parts of Nanyang to raise huge sums of money and purchased land in Jiangwan successively. By the winter of the ninth year of the Republic of China, construction was started, and the university department was moved in from Xujiahui in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. The original site of the Li Gong Temple was used as the school building for the middle school department. In the thirteenth year, Guo Renyuan acted as the president. During the ten years that followed, the school building project was expanded, and it was successively approved by the former Ministry of Education in Beijing and the former University Council of the National Government. In the eighteenth year, in accordance with the university regulations promulgated by the Ministry, the four colleges of literature, science, law, and commerce were established. In the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, President Li was granted a leave of absence by the Board of Trustees due to old age and frailty. Tian Qianzhi and Wu Nanxuan served as president and vice-president, respectively. In the twenty-sixth year, the War of Resistance against Japan broke out. The Tan School and the Daxia Fire School jointly moved inland to start classes, with the first department in Lushan and the second department in Guiyang. The former was mainly based on the school, and the latter was mainly based on the Daxia. Unexpectedly, the war situation suddenly changed before the Lushan school had started for a month, and the disaster of the Kou became more and more serious. Therefore, they moved to Chongqing and temporarily borrowed classes from the Fudan Middle School in Caiyuanba. In March of the following year, the school and Daxia separated and rented Huangjue Town in Beibei, Chongqing, to start classes. Therefore, the equipment was simple, and the teachers were lacking. However, the emotions of the teachers and students became more and more resilient. In the same year, more than 400 mu of land in Xiaba, Beitiao, was purchased, and major construction was carried out year by year, and a farm was opened. The original barren land was transformed into a magnificent institution of higher learning in no time. Teachers and students studied there, and the people of the accompanying capital envied and admired each other. In the spring of the thirty-first year of the Republic of China, the Ministry ordered the school to be changed to a national institution. The following year, the Ministry sent Zhang Yi to succeed him as the president, striving to improve the teaching and research equipment and actively expand the construction, which increased day by day. During this period, the journalism students and teachers cooperated to build the Journalism Museum, which was completed in the spring of the thirty-fourth year, and was especially noticed by people in the journalism industry. Therefore, the equipment was gradually complete. Looking across the river, the magnificent school buildings were row upon row, the water flowed gurgling, the strings and songs filled the ears, and the prosperity of humanities was unprecedented.

After the victory of the War of Resistance, the school returned to the east and moved back to the original site in Jiangwan. In the spring of the thirty-fifth year, the authorities allocated many buildings of enemy property to the south of the school to make up for the shortage, but it was still far from enough. Prior to that, the school had set up a cram school in Shanghai when it moved inland. At this point, the students and staff in Shanghai and Chongqing gathered together, and the expansion of its scale and size far surpassed that of the past.

2. Current Situation

The school currently has more than 2,800 faculty and students, divided into five colleges of literature, science, law, commerce, and agriculture, with a total of 23 departments and sections. The details are as follows: (1) College of Literature: Department of Chinese, Department of Foreign Languages, Department of History and Geography, Department of Journalism, Department of Education. (2) College of Science: Department of Mathematics and Physics, Department of Chemistry, Department of Biology (with marine group), Department of Civil Engineering. (3) College of Law: Department of Law (with judicial group), Department of Political Science, Department of Economics (with Institute of Economics), Department of Sociology. (4) College of Commerce: Department of Banking, Department of Accounting, Department of Statistics, Department of Cooperation, Department of Statistics. (5) College of Agriculture: Department of Agronomy, Department of Horticulture, Tea Specialization. Last year, entrusted by the Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the school jointly ran a training class for senior fisheries technicians and opened two cram school classes (equivalent to the previous pre-university classes) to accommodate students who applied to the school but were not admitted and passed the screening test. After one year of study, if they want to enter the school, they still have to participate in the freshman examination. In addition, in order to train prison management talents, the Ministry of Education will add a specialization in court prison officials in the school next semester, with a two-year graduation.

The school is now一心一意, trying to improve the level of students and enhance the academic level. Last year, more than 12,000 people applied, ranking first in the national non-regional enrollment. In the future, the school has decided to focus on quality rather than quantity, and the admission standards for freshmen will also be increased as much as possible.

This summer, all colleges and departments are recruiting male and female freshmen in the first grade. Among them, except for the entire Department of Education, which is treated as normal students, the Chinese, Foreign Languages, History and Geography Departments of the College of Literature, and the Mathematics and Physics, Chemistry, and Biology Departments of the College of Science also recruit one-tenth of normal students. Registration dates are from August 1st to 4th, and the examination dates are from August 10th to 12th. See July 5th issue of this newspaper for details.

3. Equipment

The school's equipment was already of a certain scale before the war. The losses during the westward migration and the occupation by the enemy puppets were quite heavy, and it has not yet recovered its old appearance. Among them, the loss of books is the most serious. Fortunately, some were purchased in the rear, and they are now being merged and cataloged, which can barely be used, but it is still far from ideal. In terms of equipment, the experimental equipment and laboratories necessary for the two colleges of agriculture and engineering are generally sufficient. Among them, the metal and woodworking factory and the agricultural product processing factory have been newly built. In addition, there are the Institute of Economics and the Journalism Research Office, which have collected a wealth of relevant materials, which is especially commendable.

### About Stalin

— Pingzhai

[Editor's Note: All those who care about the facts of World War II must know Major General Ellis M. Zacharias. Mr. Chai was the Deputy Director of the Intelligence Bureau of the U.S. Department of the Navy during the war and made great contributions. This article is the information he provided to President Truman, published in the June issue of "United Nations World" magazine this year. Studying the main purpose of the original text, it seems to be an analysis of the Soviet situation after the Soviet side announced the exchange of documents between U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov regarding direct U.S.-Soviet negotiations in May. Mr. Chai once strongly stated that his information source was absolutely reliable, and suggested that Du Shi directly discuss with the ultimate goal of signing a U.S.-Soviet non-aggression treaty, and advocated that the treaty should include the division of spheres of influence between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. However, due to space constraints, some parts had to be deleted.]

In 1941, President Roosevelt's special envoy Hopkins saw Stalin and reported to the President: "Stalin is the Soviet Union. If we want to know what the Soviet Union will do, how it will act, how it will do it... we must see Stalin himself."

Hopkins' words are still equally accurate today. Stalin is the Soviet Union. He has no staff, and no think tank. Although there are many people around him, no one can influence Stalin's will, not even Molotov.

But Stalin himself does not want outsiders to know that everything is decided by him alone. When the current British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Cripps, talked to him about the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, Stalin pointed to Molotov, who was sitting next to him, and said, "Don't blame me. This is Molotov's idea!"

In fact, when Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill held various meetings, Luo and Qiu brought many political and military advisors, but Stalin brought very few attendants. At the Yalta Conference, he had more attendants, but he almost never asked them for their opinions. Only once, he turned to a Red Army general and said a few words, which surprised everyone—but, in fact, Stalin just asked the general to get him a cup of tea.

But the Soviet Communist Party Politburo has a great influence on Stalin. According to Bayanov, a former secretary hired by Stalin, "Stalin never expresses his opinion at meetings, but listens attentively. After everyone has finished speaking, he stands up and says a few words, and his opinion is often adopted."

Stalin is sixty-eight years old this year. He is an extremely energetic person, but it is not easy to see on the surface. Although he worked extremely hard during the war, he is still in very good spirits. He has heart disease, and according to doctors, the disease is quite serious, but not necessarily fatal. Stalin strictly follows the doctor's instructions, just as he expects all communists to absolutely obey the party's decisions. Stalin is determined to live.

Stalin is determined to leave behind a strong and unified Soviet Union. Therefore, to avoid possible chaos, he is writing a book? In this book, he will list in detail his opinions on party, government, and diplomatic affairs for his future successors to refer to.

Stalin's current most concern is the security of this Soviet territory between Berlin and Vladivostok. As early as the Yalta Conference in 1945, he was constantly mentioning the post-war border issue. He said at the time:

If a country wants to go to war with another country, then it must first find a border, and strive to cross this border to reach the country it is preparing to attack. In fact, the aggressor often finds such a border—many countries often willingly "lend" it such a border.

The implementation of [the Truman Doctrine] made him feel that his political philosophy had been proven. But he also admitted that his own "Stalinism" had already preceded Truman. The so-called "Stalinism" is to expand the Soviet border westward to central Germany, and eastward to the Kuril Islands and North Korea north of the 38th parallel. Until the end of 1947, Stalin still believed that the fear of the revival of Germany in various countries could promote a kind of unity. But in the past six months, he discovered his mistake. What the countries fear is not Germany, but the Soviet Union itself.

Stalin is currently quite wary of the United States, because he suspects that the United States has aggressive intentions. But he firmly believes that the governments of Britain and the United States are definitely not willing to have another war now. He believes that there are three kinds of people in the United States who are eager to create another world war. These three kinds of people are: (1) Economic leaders, that is, what he calls "capitalists," who only seek to expand the market and do not hesitate to take any means; (2) Soldiers: Stalin believes that soldiers are not particularly fond of fighting, but are willing to create a tense situation in order to use large amounts of funds; (3) Some frustrated politicians, who want to find an opportunity to come to power in another war.

What is Stalin's own attitude towards war? According to the most reliable information, Stalin's meaning can be explained in the following two points: (1) He knows very well that the Soviet system cannot withstand the test of a new war (Stalin said to Harriman), so he himself has never directly taken aggressive actions; (2) However, if he is attacked, he is determined to mobilize all manpower and material resources, ruthlessly forcing the whole country to participate in the war, and never surrender. He once said: "Even if we have exhausted everything by that time: no people, no weapons, no ammunition—our women must also pick up boiling water and splash it on the invaders!"

### Hurricane

— Gongsun Wu

The Nanyue Zhi states that hurricanes are common in Xi'an, and a hurricane is a wind from all directions. They usually occur in May and June, and chickens and dogs do not crow before they arrive. The Lingbiao Lu says that in summer and autumn there is a halo like a rainbow, which is called the mother of the hurricane, and there must be a hurricane. Coastal areas in Fujian and Guangdong often have hurricanes in summer and autumn, which are large whirlwinds. Each occurrence lasts for an indefinite period, and it must be a wind from all directions. If the west wind has not arrived, even if the momentum is slightly reduced, it is known that it is not over yet. After a hurricane, it must be followed by heavy rain, and only then will the state of alert be lifted. As for seeing a halo and knowing that there will be wind, it is not only the Lingbiao that knows this. In Guangzhou, people call a hurricane "hitting the wind," or "hitting the wind hurricane." The pronunciation of the word hurricane in the spoken language is slightly wrong, but it is not a different word. The English word "Typhoon," according to the Oxford Dictionary, means hurricane, and is explained as "a violent storm on the seas of China," derived from the Chinese word "大風" (dà fēng, great wind). English already has words such as "狂風" (violent wind) and "旋風" (whirlwind), so it must have taken the Chinese pronunciation to create this word, which is in line with the meaning of "naming according to the owner." More than ten years ago, I first saw the word "颱" (tái, typhoon) in a newspaper. I am ashamed of my lack of learning and still do not know where this word comes from. If it is said to be related to Taiwan, the scientific community may not say so. Is it specially made in imitation of English? If so, then it is very strange.

### A Trip to Jade Emperor Mountain

— Banmeng Laoren

When I was at Miaozhi Temple in Qixia Ridge, I opened the window every day and saw a lush and beautiful scene in the southeast, which is Jade Emperor Mountain, also known as Yu Huang Mountain. The peaks are high and towering, and there are often clouds and mist surrounding them, but it is not included in the Ten Scenes of West Lake or the Eight Scenes of Qiantang. My friend, the lay Buddhist Mujushi, often said that the Taoist Li Zidong in the Jade Emperor Palace on the top of the mountain is very capable, and all the Taoist temples in West Lake are under the jurisdiction of the Jade Emperor Palace. The Jin Gu Cave and Ge Xian Nunnery nearby are all managed by people sent from the Jade Emperor Palace. Taoist Li is also a remarkable person.

I have wanted to visit Jade Emperor Mountain for a long time. One day, I went down the mountain from Ziyun Cave, entered Su Causeway to the south, passed Liu Bridge, and walked about five li. I sat for a while in the Buhua and Ban Shan Pavilions on the causeway. At the end of the causeway, I walked east and arrived at Jingci Temple, where a team was stationed, so I did not enter. Further on, there is a large stone bridge. After crossing the bridge and turning left, I got a large road with neat stone slabs. I invited the road to go towards the mountain in front of me. Both sides are mountains, gradually surrounding me, and Jade Emperor Mountain is in sight. There is a pavilion halfway, called Wangxian. Resting and continuing, I soon arrived at the entrance of the Jade Emperor Mountain Avenue, and there was another pavilion at the entrance. The stone steps were neat, and the trees on both sides were lush, so there was no suffering from the sun, and there was another pavilion, called Ciyun Cave Heaven, opposite Ciyun Cave. Turning upwards, there was a stele beside the road, inscribed with Qianyun Cave. I did not enter either of these two caves. Going up again, I was already high, peeking at the Qiantang River, the sails were distinct, and the train moving on the opposite bank was also wriggling in sight. Near the top, I saw a wooden sign indicating that Zilai Cave was accessible from here, so I first visited Zilai Cave. The cave is divided into three sections, as wide and high as a huge mansion. The first section has a tea seat, where you can sit and drink tea. Entering the second section, I went down the steps, and it was vast and empty. Entering the third section, I went down the steps again, and it was also vast and empty. People say that this is artificially opened up, large but useless, and it is very good as a bomb shelter. However, artificial construction is also very difficult. After the third section, it was dark and without light. Using a cane to explore, there were no steps, so I returned in vain. A new square was built next to the cave, with high buildings, bright windows and clean tables, spotless, which can be called a good place to escape the summer heat, but there is no lofty hermit living in it, only a photography shop in it.

Zilai Cave, originally named Feilong Cave, is deep and unpredictable, and it is said to be connected to the mountains in She County, Anhui, but there is no evidence. After Taoist Li Zidong opened it up, he renamed it Zilai Cave, because his name is Zidong, taking the meaning of purple energy coming from the east. The name is a bit mundane. Exiting the cave and going up again, there is a very wide pavilion, called Qixing Pavilion. Behind the pavilion are seven-star jars, which are cast in iron, as tall as a person, and surrounded by writings. The jars all contain water. There were originally seven jars, but now only five remain. Going up again from Qixing Pavilion, I had reached the top of the mountain, and the bamboo forest was dense along the way. Entering the Jade Emperor Palace, the main hall is not magnificent, but the back room is quite exquisite. Its height is about 200 meters above sea level, not as high as the north and south peaks, but its steepness exceeds them. The trees on the avenue up the mountain are especially lush, and they are the best in the area.

I did not want to go down the mountain the way I came, so I went down from the west. Passing a pavilion called Linhai, the west road is far less neat than the east road, and there are no trees along the road. The further I went down, the more desolate it became. I saw Hupao Temple in the distance, but I did not go there because I did not have time. After reaching the plain, I took the car road to Su Causeway and went north to return home.

### Small Statistics

— Xiansi

According to U.S. estimates, about 40,000 Axis war criminals have been reported, of which 34,000 are on the run or cannot be traced. A total of 1,567 have been sentenced to death by Allied war crimes tribunals.

Scientific research in the United States is no longer solely conducted by universities. In fact, in the past year, research funding paid by the U.S. government accounted for 54 percent of all research funding in the United States, research funding borne by industry accounted for 39 percent of the total, and funding for research by purely academic groups accounted for only 7 percent of the total.

The U.S. Postal Authority announced that each American receives an average of 275 pieces of mail each year.

### Lu Xun's Book Buying

— Nian Xin

The previous article discussed "Lu Xun's Book Collection" and recorded the process of his selling "A Complete Collection of Leisurely Talks." This article will briefly describe Lu Xun's involvement in the book market, focusing on his "book buying."

According to records, Lu Xun mostly purchased Japanese books at Uchiyama Bookstore. When he needed Western masterpieces, he would also ask the store to order them on his behalf. This was because Lu Xun had a close friendship with the bookstore owner and often visited the store for conversations. As for thread-bound books, he would ask his younger brother, Mr. Qiaofeng, to purchase those published by the Commercial Press on his behalf. For old block-printed books, he would go to the book market in the central district. Sometimes, he would hire a motorcycle to transport them back, which can be found in his "Diary." Among the bookstores he frequented, the China Bookstore on Xizang Road was the most visited (although it is now closed). People in the store can still vividly recount stories of his book purchases. It is said that Lu Xun paid great attention to the binding of books, always choosing those in perfect condition. He was generous with book prices and did not ask for discounts. He was also very familiar with the editions and origins of each book. This stemmed from Lu Xun's profound and solid knowledge of traditional Chinese learning, so he was very particular about versions. "Random Talks After Illness" records that in order to obtain the "newly engraved edition of the Jia Ye Tang of the Liu family in Wuxing" of the Qing Dynasty banned book "The Unofficial History of Anlong," he did not hesitate to travel repeatedly and endured the arrogance of the seller, but still did not succeed. In the end, he "asked a friend to buy it after many twists and turns," which made him realize the difficulty of obtaining books, "It seems that you have to be familiar or go to a familiar bookstore to buy it."

However, there were also times when he unintentionally purchased banned books. For example, the "Xiao Xue Da Quan Case" of Yin Jiaquan in the 46th year of Qianlong, which was also one of the literary inquisitions in the early Qing Dynasty. The book "Xiao Xue Da Quan," which served as the catalyst for this case, was unintentionally bought by Lu Xun while "strolling around the Fourth Road area before the Dragon Boat Festival. (referring to banned books - new note) It is called "Xiao Xue Da Quan," a total of five volumes, priced at seven corners. Seeing this title, not many people would welcome it, however, it is a banned book of the Qing Dynasty." The ease of this purchase was far different from the aforementioned purchase of "The Unofficial History of Anlong."

### Savings

— Jin Jin

Speaking of currency issues, no one can maintain a state of calm. But the human heart is so contradictory, the more worthless paper money becomes, the more urgent the desire to preserve its value. At present, although the word "savings" has long been abandoned, another form of disguised savings, such as purchasing and storing easily sellable daily necessities, still exists. Indeed, sometimes the dividing line between "hoarding" and "saving goods" is difficult to define. If "saving goods" is used as a means of coping with unexpected expenses or temporary emergencies, then perhaps the component of forgiveness is greater than the component of condemnation.

In times of severe price fluctuations, whoever holds paper money in their hands feels uneasy all day long. I think this is not their true intention, but rather forced by the environment. I remember that two weeks ago, my friend A received an income of 11 million yuan and asked B to find a way to buy him some "anything." B suggested that the purchased items should be (1) easy to sell, (2) cheap and in large quantities, and (3) have a lower multiple of price increase. After B's consideration, he decided to buy toilet paper for A. A few days later, A went to see B again, but B, because the price of toilet paper had risen, instead bought 2,200 pairs of "charcoal bases" at S, which were only worth a few cents each before the war. Afterwards, what made A feel somewhat gratified and made those with meager incomes feel regret was that the current 11 million yuan could not even buy the same quantity of "charcoal bases."

From a more technical standpoint, this phenomenon of "saving goods" is naturally also a manifestation of a morbid state. Everyone flocks to goods, exceeding the normal supply and demand relationship, and the supply of goods will become more depleted, becoming more expensive the more they are bought, which is tantamount to "digging one's own grave." A more reasonable approach would be for the authorities to find ways to encourage various users to purchase various production tools, such as giving discounts or installment payments. As the saying goes, "A workman must first sharpen his tools if he wants to do his job well." Now, allowing many of the general public with limited resources or slight savings to have sharp "tools" will increase production efficiency. In this way, individual income will have another outlet, which will also be of some help in alleviating the shortage of goods?

"Collected Drafts from West Slope," written by Song 　, the Jiangsu Governor in the early Qing Dynasty, discusses the bestowal of food during Emperor Kangxi's southern tour, saying: Song Luo is an old minister, different from the Fujian Governor, and should be granted living sheep, pickled chicken, deer tail, deer tongue, venison, dried sturgeon, dried wild chicken, etc., according to the example of generals and governors. Another imperial decree said: I have a daily tofu, which is different from ordinary ones. Because the governor is an elderly person, the imperial kitchen eunuch can be instructed to teach the governor's cook, for the benefit of the second half of his life. Thus, the value of tofu surpassed even meat and delicacies. One wonders how good and how to make Emperor Kangxi's tofu. Liang Weiju also recorded that when he 　taught at Nanpu Academy, there was a teacher named Liu Yin 　, a professor, whose tofu-making skills were not only used in Pucheng, but also unmatched by those who discussed cooking elsewhere. This means that even "tofu-eating officials" have the most exquisite tofu. Liang also said: When he was an official in Shandong, he had a public banquet with the education commissioner, the financial commissioner, and the transport commissioner on Daming Lake. The Magistrate of Licheng County, Hou 　ying, prepared the food. After eating halfway through, each person was presented with a small dish, with five or six locusts in each dish. Eating them was extremely enjoyable, and everyone was stunned and could not discern what they were. Hou said that this was tofu. The people suspected that he had a secret recipe. The above are all mysterious stories about tofu, quite like the so-called "turning the rotten into the magical." In fact, the various ways of making tofu available in the market are already very good, and red sauce tofu and white fermented tofu each have their own ingenuity, enough to satisfy the appetite. Because tofu is inherently a good thing, but because it is produced in large quantities, it is regarded as ordinary. Once it is processed and finely made, it will naturally become a delicacy, without the need for too much mystery. However, with the recent soaring prices, red sauce tofu costs 20,000 per piece, and white tofu costs twice as much. Even the tofu sold in the vegetable market that has not been cooked is costly to buy and make, which is not the humble appearance of the past.

### Lines from Deep in the Clouds

— Bai Wu

I asked my brother Huang Pingxun for a poem and wrote 112 characters on a fan as a substitute for a letter, knowing that Pingxun had ink to create.

To be a dragon or to be a snake, look at success or failure. Killing chickens and being a dog gives birth to a hundred monsters. Huang Sheng is not 　satisfactory and returns. Spinning my yarns deep in the clouds, with few words. Ten years have passed without seeing each other, we should have a poem together. A 　coolness seeks to paint. An old friend treats me well and　the current trend. Knowing that I cherish what I have and will not sell it. Morning after morning, I grind ink with little dew. Night after night, I complete poems and break the wine abstinence. I only pity that the short-lived Pine Mushroom Marquis is exhausted, and countless brushes have been ruined over the years. 　　Quite spreading a ten thousand-mouthed name, in a grand manner, indeed an official style. How, how is this please be safe? Bai Jiao of the Clouds bows his head.
