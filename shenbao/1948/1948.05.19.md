### The United States Is Concerned About China's Economic Situation; Hopes to See a New Situation at the Time of the Implementation of the Constitution

[Report, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] According to diplomatic sources, the United States is extremely concerned about the situation in China. It is generally believed that China's economic situation has deteriorated in the past year, and the current implementation of the Constitution is the best opportunity for reform. All parties in the United States hope that China can have a new situation at this time, so as to further assist China and improve military and economic aspects in the near future. However, the US side is extremely concerned about the use of US aid. If the person in charge can be someone who has a relatively close relationship with the United States and is able to be responsible and pragmatic like Song Ziwen, the US's confidence in China will definitely increase, because Song's achievements in leading the construction of South China in recent years have been praised by people at home and abroad.

### Youth and Democratic Socialist Party Legislators Dispute; Currently Under Discussion to Find a Solution

Report on the Process of Returning to Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Regarding the dispute between the Youth and Democratic Socialist Party legislators, Zhang Ji, Chen Lifu and other seven people from the Kuomintang are currently discussing and negotiating a solution. It is reported that after the joint meeting held by the Youth and Democratic Socialist Party in Shanghai, they have expressed four opinions and one explanation. The four opinions are: (1) Respect the agreement between the three parties and maintain the original number of legislators. (2) Hope to still use the "Extraordinary Party" method to solve the number issue. (3) Agree to the solution by Lu Zhi, and when a considerable number is reached, the Youth and Democratic Socialist Party legislators will attend the meeting. (4) Hope to reserve a considerable number of convening members of each committee in the Legislative Yuan. The one explanation is that the issue of three-party cooperation is not insisted upon, but is only a policy issue and still includes issues other than policy. According to Kuomintang figures, the Kuomintang does not intend to make any statements regarding the various remarks made by the Youth and Democratic Socialist Party in Shanghai. Now is not the time for debate, and this debate is not beneficial to the cooperation of the three parties.

### People of Wuxi Welcome and Cheer

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 18th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang and his wife traveled from the Jinghang National Highway through Yixing to Wuxi on the 16th. For two days, they boated on Taihu Lake, visiting famous scenic spots such as Xuelang Mountain, Dushan, Longtouzhu, and Zhongdushan. After a long period of hard work, the Chairman was able to take this break and felt refreshed. As the presidential inauguration ceremony was approaching, they left Wuxi at 10:07 AM on the morning of the 18th and returned to Nanjing.

The electricity for the lights held in Liyuan Lake Scenic Area was supplied by the generators sent by the electricity company. The generators left last night, and the disturbing sounds of the generators could no longer be heard from the woods a thousand yards away. After a night's rest, the Chairman and his wife were refreshed and in better spirits. They got up at 6:15 AM on the morning of the 18th and went for a walk by the lake and did some stretching exercises. They had breakfast with their wife at 9:15 AM. At that time, the special car prepared for the Chairman had arrived at the Xizhan Station from Changzhou.

### First Meeting of the First Session of the Legislative Yuan; Article-by-Article Discussion of Rules of Procedure; No Conclusion Yet Reached on "Exercise of the Right of Consent"

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The first meeting of the first session of the first Legislative Yuan under the Constitution was held on the morning of the 18th. At 9:40 AM, President Sun Ke and Secretary-General Zhang Zhaoyuan took their seats amidst applause to preside over the meeting. Mr. Zhang reported that the number of attending members was sufficient to open the meeting as required by law, and Mr. Sun announced the opening of the meeting and made a speech briefly stating: "My colleagues have mistakenly loved and trusted me, and I have been elected as President to share the heavy responsibility with you. I am truly terrified and excited. I hope that you will work together so that we do not fail in our mission." Then, he presented a temporary report, appointing Zhang Zhaoyuan as the Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan based on the organizational regulations, and he would take office first. After the President was sworn in, he would submit a formal appointment request. The audience learned of Mr. Zhang's brief resume and welcomed him with applause. Then, Mr. Zhang read the report on the results of the vote for Vice President on the afternoon of the 17th. At 9:30 AM, the discussion began, starting with the rules of procedure. Tree Wen, the convening member of the Rules of Procedure Drafting Committee, briefly reported on the drafting process, explaining that after the four meetings and the efforts of the drafting team day and night, the chapters and articles of the draft had been formulated. However, no unanimous conclusion was reached on Chapter 8, "Exercise of the Right of Consent." After summarizing the differences, there were four types: "(1) It is advocated that it is necessary to allow those who propose policies and personnel opinions, because when exercising the right of consent to the President of the Executive Yuan, if no appropriate information is provided, it is difficult to determine the standard for whether to agree or disagree. Administration places great emphasis on facilities, and policy implementation depends on the selection of personnel. Therefore, when the President of the Executive Yuan requests consent, it seems appropriate to first propose policies and personnel opinions for reference. (2) It is advocated that policy opinions are the prelude to the policy guidelines in Article 57 of the Constitution, and it seems necessary to provide them for reference. As for personnel, they should be responsible for their own actions, and there is no need to propose opinions. (3) It is believed that Article 55 of the Constitution only stipulates that the President of the Executive Yuan is nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Legislative Yuan, and there are no other regulations. It is advocated that there is no need to propose policies and personnel opinions. (4) It is advocated that in addition to not needing to propose policies and personnel opinions, the procedure does not need to be reviewed by the full committee and should be directly submitted to the plenary meeting of the Yuan for a vote." According to these four opinions, four different versions of Chapter 8, A, B, C, and D, were drafted (as seen in this newspaper on the 16th) and submitted to the general assembly for public decision. Chen Guyuan, the convening member of the drafting team, continued to put forward four key points: (1) The rules themselves are binding on the Yuan itself, and do not need to be promulgated by the President to be made into law. When drafting the draft, attention has been paid to not involving the constitutional powers of other agencies. As for the point raised by some members that special cases must be approved by two-thirds of the attending members before they can be passed, this has not been included in the draft as it requires amending the organizational law. (2) Political powers have been individually stipulated, but in addition to the right of interpellation, which the drafting committee decided to propose, there are four different articles regarding the right of consent, which are still awaiting discussion and decision by the general assembly. (3) In order to respect the spirit of democracy and equality, the number of people required for various motions has been reduced as much as possible, except for the powers of the President during the meeting, which are equivalent to the powers of an ordinary chairman. (4) In order to respect freedom of speech, the speaking time has been extended, but in order to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to speak, it is necessary to impose appropriate restrictions on the speaking time of individuals. At 10:10 AM, President Sun, with the consent of the audience, first conducted a broad discussion. Yang Yuqing and eight others spoke in succession, among whom only Jian Sanzeng emphasized the importance of the right of interpellation, opposed the two provisions in the draft that the time for interpellation was limited to after the report and that interpellation could not be used as a topic of discussion, and advocated that the exercise of the right of recommendation and the right of investigation should also be added. The rest of the opinions were unanimously focused on Chapter 8, whether the nominee should be allowed to propose policies and personnel opinions before exercising the right of consent, and whether the same should be subject to a review stage or a direct vote. The most important points in the previous meetings of the drafting committee are now present in the plenary meeting, and the ranks of both the pros and cons have increased. Yang Yuqing, Jian Guansan, Wang Puhan, Lu Yuwen, and Xu Pan Yun were in favor of the first opinion of the drafting committee and supported the A proposal, believing that personnel can influence policies, and it is necessary to know the President of the Executive Yuan's policies and opinions before exercising the right of consent, and it can also seek a basis for cooperation between the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, and allow the President to know how to obtain political stability. They also claimed that those who advocate this have never asked for a specific list, but only think it is necessary to ask the President to notify the person nominated to propose policies and personnel opinions, which is very flexible and definitely not an unconstitutional or excessive request. Chen Shaoxian and Zhang Qingzhen held the second opinion and supported the B proposal, believing that policy opinions can be proposed, but personnel opinions should not be proposed. Zhu Wende believed that according to the Constitution, the Legislative Yuan can supervise the President of the Executive Yuan's personnel management through the method of controlling the President of the Yuan, and the Executive Yuan's policy guidelines will be proposed after the establishment of the Executive Yuan. The Legislative Yuan should not require the nominee for President of the Executive Yuan to propose policies and personnel opinions before exercising the right of consent. Lu Fu further pointed out that the exercise of the right of consent should be decided directly by voting, without the need for review by the full committee, which would delay time and affect government affairs, claiming to agree with the D proposal. During the meeting, Kong Geng once claimed that most of the broad statements were about Chapter 8 and that it was possible to discuss each chapter and article first, and then speak as much as possible when it came to Chapter 8. However, as there were more than 50 people requesting to speak, Kong's opinion was not accepted by the audience. At 12:00 noon, President Sun asked the audience to extend the meeting by half an hour, but it was not agreed. The President announced a temporary motion that the temporary chairman Wu Tiecheng and the temporary secretary-general Lou Tongsun should be comforted for their hard work in presiding over the preparatory meeting. All members applauded and passed the motion, and then adjourned the meeting.

### Continued Meeting Tomorrow Afternoon

The meeting will resume at 3:30 PM this afternoon. All attending committee members believe that there are still many who wish to speak. If a single, comprehensive discussion is held, it would take too long. Therefore, it was unanimously agreed to proceed chapter by chapter in a reading meeting format. The secretarial staff immediately began reading the full draft. The first reading was completed at 4:00 PM, followed by a second reading. The clauses of the draft were read out one by one, and either passed without objection, amended after discussion and voting, or maintained as originally written. Chapters One, "General Provisions," and Two, "Proposals," were smoothly passed. In Chapter Three, "Agenda," Huang Yuanbin and Lu suggested that if the agenda is delivered to each committee member two days before the meeting, it may be difficult to keep some important financial and economic matters confidential. However, Deng Hongye, Lei Yin, and others pointed out that secret meetings can be held at any time for financial, economic, and other important issues, as well as question-and-answer sessions. In such cases, the agenda should be distributed on an ad hoc basis. Special regulations should not be included in the rules of procedure. As a result, Article 20 was maintained in its original form. Article 24 of Chapter Four, "Meetings," stated, "The院 [referring to the Legislative Yuan] shall meet twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays, and may increase the number of meetings if necessary." Peng Chunshi proposed changing the first half of the sentence to "meet once a week on Fridays." Wu Shangying, however, believed that the meeting schedule should not be so rigid, and suggested modifying the first half of the sentence to "meet once a week as a principle." Du Guangtian, Lei Gu, Jiang Yiping, Zhang Jinjian, and others stood up to object, insisting that meetings must be held regularly to avoid difficulties in notification and to allow committee members to arrange their lives and work. They also emphasized that the constitutional Legislative Yuan should not be lazy, that power must be exercised in the meeting place, and that the number of meetings should not be too few. After a vote, the original proposal was maintained. In Chapter Five, "Readings," Article 36 of the second reading section, "Amendments to the reports of the committees shall be taken as agenda items," was deemed unnecessary and deleted. In Chapter Six, "Discussion," regarding speaking time, the original draft stipulated that speeches explaining, questioning, or answering proposals should not exceed 20 minutes, and discussion speeches should not exceed 10 minutes. This was amended to say that speeches explaining, questioning, answering, or discussing should not exceed 10 minutes. In the last article of Chapter Seven, "Voting," "If, during a meeting, a committee member present raises a question about the number of people present, and the check shows that the number is less than the quorum, no vote shall be taken," Huang Yuren questioned, believing that if there is no quorum, the meeting should be adjourned immediately, and that this article seemed unnecessary. However, Chen Yuanyuan and Wu Wangji cited Article 70 of Chapter Twelve, "Order," "Committee members who leave the meeting early shall not affect the calculation of the quorum for the meeting," to explain the drafting committee and the drafting group's concerns about Article 70 and the addition of an article in the "Voting" chapter. They stated that this provision would avoid careless voting and maintain the normal progress of meetings without resolutions. Finally, President Sun used the British Parliament as an example to explain in detail, and Huang's doubts were resolved. By this point, half of the second reading of the rules of procedure had been completed. It was time to adjourn. President Sun declared that the eighth chapter, "Exercise of the Right of Consent," had taken three hours in the morning without conclusion. The ninth chapter, "Listening to Reports and Questioning," is also extremely important. The meeting will be adjourned on the 19th because the National Assembly Hall needs to be decorated for the inauguration ceremony of the President and Vice President on the 20th. If there are no other difficulties, the second meeting will be held on the afternoon of the 20th to continue the discussion. However, since there are still more than 50 people waiting to speak, their opinions should be submitted in writing to the secretariat. The meeting adjourned at 6:15 PM.

Editorial

### The Korean Political Situation After the South Korean General Election

The South Korean general election on the 10th has been completed in an atmosphere of unrest. Although the report is still being drafted, according to news reports, almost all of the eight million South Korean people participated in the voting. After inspecting various electoral districts in Seoul, Syrian representative to the United Nations Commission on Korea, Mohsin, stated, "The South Korean election has been successful. The election proceeded smoothly, and the organization was excellent." The committee is preparing to come to Shanghai to draft a report and present it to the Little General Assembly. According to US Commander in Korea, Lieutenant General Hodge, "The South Korean election is an unprecedented victory for democracy." He is confident that South Korea will complete the work of forming a government soon. Syngman Rhee himself also said, "I will order the North Korean people and the communist army to abandon the Soviet Union and return," appearing infinitely optimistic. On the other hand, however, the development of the situation in North and South Korea is still very serious. The separate election in South Korea has not brought optimistic signs, but has increased the factors of division between North and South Korea. This is a tragedy for Korea and the sorrow of the Korean people!

The performance of the Korean tragedy has deepened the division between North and South Korea. Moreover, this unfortunate division is bound to turn Korea into a second Greece. The current development of the political situation in North and South Korea not only shows that the divided situation is becoming more and more profound, but also shows that the Koreans, trapped between Qi and Chu, do not measure their strength, are not self-aware, and throw themselves into the net of division. Their future is very sad. A recent "Modern Historical Materials" discussion of the Korean tragedy pointed out that "The current division of Korea is not the fault of the Koreans themselves. The reason lies in the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. Neither the United States nor the Soviet Union is willing to give up its position in Korea, thus forming a situation of division and separation. It is really difficult to operate; it will undoubtedly lead to tragic results. Not only will Korea's mountains and rivers be completely destroyed, but its situation may affect world peace. The United States and the Soviet Union know the severity of the Korean situation, but they are still willing to take a desperate gamble. Of course, what is sad is the Korean people." This is a fair view, predicting that Korea will produce tragic results, creating a cold and ruthless drama unprecedented in Korean history.

The United States and the Soviet Union are well aware of the potential crisis in the Korean issue, but they are willing to take a desperate gamble. On April 30, Pyongyang Radio announced that North Korea had passed a constitution governing the entire country (including the US military occupation zone). The constitution stipulates that Seoul is the capital of the "Democratic People's Republic of Korea," but currently temporarily located in Pyongyang. The passage of the North Korean constitution and the convening of the Pyongyang meeting on the 14th fully demonstrate that the Soviet Union recognizes North Korea as an autonomous country. The Soviet Union's attitude toward the Korean issue will not be directed at the United States or South Korea, but will place responsibility for all future matters on North Korea. US Commander Hodge stated on the one hand, "The constitution was approved by the North Korean People's Committee, which is a provisional government controlled by the Communist Party in the Soviet occupation zone." He also disclosed a letter he sent to Soviet Commander Kolokov of North Korea on April 27, stating, "I do not recognize the People's Committee as the government of North Korea, nor do I wish to negotiate with the People's Committee." On the other hand, it does not hesitate to obliterate Korean public opinion and resolutely implement the separate election in South Korea. At the time of the vote on the 10th, it did not hesitate to use force to suppress the turmoil and coerce people to participate in the voting. The main participants in this South Korean election are officials of the Korean Democratic Party and the Korean National Party. Most of the other non-party and non-faction and right-wing figures are entangled with Syngman Rhee. Rhee is a pro-American figure, and Kim is an old associate of Kim Il-sung. Apart from this, no anti-Syngman Rhee faction participated. Even Kim Gu and Kim Kyu-sik did not participate in the election. Therefore, this South Korean election is a joint performance by the United States and Syngman Rhee in order to confront the Soviet Union. The political methods he displays seem to have fallen behind. Apart from Syngman Rhee himself saying "for the victory of democracy," those who look at it with a critical eye cannot help but feel deeply moved.

In order to restore to the Korean situation, North Korea, in order to woo right-wing and centrist factions, held a second consultation in Pyongyang on the 14th. This consultation may discuss the issue of forming a government. At the same time, North Korea threatened to cut off power supply to South Korea, not hesitating to sever relations between North and South Korea. More than 20% of South Korea's electricity relies on supply from North Korea, but South Korea has not paid for the electricity. The US military has stopped supplying electricity to North Korea, and recently dispatched two warships to Busan and Incheon, preparing to supply South Korea with electricity from warships. This step by North Korea is a major counterattack against South Korea, with significant implications, and is bound to cause a new crisis between the United States and the Soviet Union. Many people worry that the severe division between North and South Korea, and the sharp antagonism between the United States and the Soviet Union, will turn from a cold war into a hot war, turning Korea into a second Greece.

The division of Korea, with the emergence of two governments in North and South Korea, is extremely worrying for the future of the Far East. "Modern History" discusses the Korean issue, calling for peace between the United States and the Soviet Union, and advocating:

(1) The United States and the Soviet Union should immediately allow Korea to become independent and conduct general elections through neutral institutions; (2) The United States and the Soviet Union should believe that the Korean people have the ability to be autonomous and should hand over power to the Korean people; or (3) The United States and the Soviet Union should, according to the Moscow Agreement, place Korea under the trusteeship of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union for five years, in order to avoid direct conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. Although we do not fully agree with these three opinions, we agree that the United States and the Soviet Union should peacefully resolve the Korean issue in view of the seriousness of the Korean situation. At this critical moment of division and union, if Korea is not rescued from the crisis of division, the Korean people will inevitably fall into the catastrophe of war.

### Ten Thousand Tons of Copper Coins Plundered by Japan; Our Delegation Demands Return

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] The Committee on Compensation and Restitution of our delegation to Japan for negotiations on Japanese reparations will soon demand that Japan return 10,000 tons of copper coins, worth US$4 million, plundered in China during the war.  8,000 tons of these copper coins are in Osaka.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Decides to Review Distribution of Compensation Machinery to Private Enterprises in Groups Due to Significant Discrepancy Between Requested and Available Quantities

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The Committee for the Handling of Japanese Reparations Materials under the Ministry of Economic Affairs held its first meeting on the afternoon of the 18th to discuss the allocation of Japanese reparations materials to private factories that had applied to purchase them.

According to a report submitted by the Industrial Department, as of the application deadline, a total of 315 private factories had applied to purchase the first batch of Japanese reparations materials, requesting a total of 10,449 machines. However, the Ministry of Economic Affairs can only allocate 2,362 machines from the first batch of Japanese reparations materials to private factories. After deducting more than 700 incomplete machines, the actual number of Japanese reparations materials that can be allocated to private enterprises in the first batch is only 1,602. Among these 1,600-plus machines, only 119 crates, totaling over 1,100 machines, have arrived in Shanghai. This is more than 9,000 machines less than the quantity requested by private factories. Recently, the Receiving Committee in Japan received another batch, of which only about 200 to 300 machines can be allocated to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Including the previous batch, the difference between the number of machines requested by private factories and the number available remains significant. The discussion and review began immediately, and the following resolutions were made: (1) The applications from private factories to purchase machines will be reviewed in five groups, with three people in each group. After each group's review, a comprehensive review will be conducted. The first group will review machinery for repairing textile machines, the second group will review machinery for repairing papermaking machines, the third group will review machinery for repairing electrical appliances, the fourth group will review machinery for repairing coal mining, and the fifth group will review other machinery. (2) Preferential treatment will be given to factories that relocated inland. The Executive Yuan stipulates that one-third should be allocated at a set price. It has now been decided that one-third of each type of machine will be taken as the standard, first calculating the value and then converting it into the number of machines. (3) In accordance with Article 4 of the "Regulations on Private Enterprises Applying for the Allocation of Japanese Reparations Materials" promulgated by the Executive Yuan, detailed review rules will be formulated separately. It is understood that the results of this review work may be available by the end of next week.

### Fishing Season at its Peak; Pirates Active; Fenghua Fishing Boats Trapped; Xiangshan Turns Back Midway; Concerned Parties Call for Suppression

[Our Newspaper, Ningbo, 18th] The fishing season along the coast of this province is mostly at the beginning of summer, especially the mid-April fishing season, which is the most prosperous. Recently, as the peak fishing season approaches, pirates have become increasingly active, with robberies and kidnappings occurring from time to time. Fenghua fishing boats have recently been surrounded by the Xu Xiaoyu gang in Daishan, who demand that the boats hand over firearms and rice and obtain flags and licenses before they can go out to sea to fish. Fishermen are unable to pay and are in a dilemma. Concerned people have gone to Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou, and other places to call for the dispatch of troops for land and sea suppression to rescue the fishing boats and maintain maritime security. Xiangshan fishing boats previously responded to Xu Xiaoyu's demands and paid four shih of rice per boat to obtain flags and licenses, hoping to go out to sea. However, they heard that the bandits still wanted to extort firearms, and fearing that they would be surrounded and unable to return once they went to sea, they decided to sacrifice the fishing season and turn back midway. The livelihood of hundreds of thousands of fishermen is a cause for concern.

### Arab Legion's Offensive Progresses Rapidly; The Capital of the Jewish State is Already in Sight; Jordanian, Iraqi, and Egyptian Armies Will Soon Join Forces; Jewish Quarter of the Holy Land Isolated

[Reuters, with the Arab Legion near the City, correspondent Maynard, 18th] The Arab Legion of Jordan, encountering no resistance in occupying Palestine, has made rapid progress and the capital of the State of Israel, Tel Aviv, is already within sight. The Arab forces' field guns are already positioned on the mountains controlling the coastal plain. Although the strategy of the Arab regular army is strictly kept secret, judging from the current rate of progress, the Jordanian, Iraqi, and Egyptian armies may join forces in the short term. Since the three armies launched their offensive in Palestine in March, they have isolated many Jewish areas. These Jewish areas, which are already behind the Arab regular army, have been handed over to the Arab Liberation Army under Qawuqji. The morale of the Palestinians, which plummeted a week ago due to the Jewish army's victory, has been revived by the intervention of neighboring countries. Thousands of Arab indigenous tribes are rushing down from the mountains with weapons to join the war. They believe that the occupation of Tel Aviv by the Arab national army is only a matter of time.

[Reuters, Cairo, 18th] The Arab Higher Executive Committee announced that the Arab forces in Palestine had occupied the city of Lummle near the international airport of Lydda, but this has not been confirmed by other parties.

[United Press, Cairo, 18th] The Arab Higher Executive Committee announced today that, according to broadcasts from Sidon, Lebanon, the Egyptian and Jordanian armies have joined forces in Lydda, 20 miles southeast of Tel Aviv. But this information has not been confirmed.

[Reuters, London, 17th] The air war in Palestine has expanded to two fronts. Egyptian aircraft attacked Tel Aviv four times in one day on the 17th. Iraqi aircraft on the eastern front also bombed the three Jewish areas of Kiryat Haim, Yavne, and Migdal, causing large fires. On the ground, the latest situation on each front is as follows: Southern Front: Cairo reports that the Egyptian army, advancing along the coastal highway, has reached Masal, 13 miles northeast of Gaza, only 35 kilometers from Jaffa and Tel Aviv; the Egyptian army, advancing deep into the southern hinterland of Palestine, is reported to have occupied Beersheba, 30 miles southeast of Gaza, but this has not been officially confirmed; Eastern Front: Iraqi armored units, under the protection of aircraft, attacked the three Jewish areas of Kiryat Haim, Yavne, and Migdal, all of which caught fire. The Iraqi army has occupied Kiryat Haim, but the Jewish army is still resisting; the Jordanian Arab Legion is still near Jericho, waiting to join the Egyptian army on the southern front and advancing eastward to Tel Aviv, 45 miles away; Northeast Front: The Syrian army, advancing towards the southeastern Sea of Galilee region, has joined forces with the Iraqi army, and the Jewish city of Samakh on the southern end of the Sea of Galilee is in a critical situation;

### Jewish Army Launches Counterattack; Occupies Acre and Attacks Lummle; Holy City of Jerusalem Surrounded Repeatedly, Becoming a Terror Hell

[Our Newspaper] London, 18th broadcast: Although the Jewish army occupied the Arab city of Al-Aral today, the situation of the Jews in Jerusalem is extremely critical. It is reported that the Arab armies fighting in Palestine include the armies of six countries: Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. Egyptian aircraft have bombed Tel Aviv for the thirteenth time.

[Reuters, Tel Aviv, 18th] The Haganah announced on the 18th that the Arab irregular forces trapped in the city of Acre on the northern shore of Palestine have surrendered to the Jewish army after 22 hours of fierce attacks by the Jewish army. If this is true, then the Palestinian coast from Tel Aviv to the Lebanese border, a line 80 miles long, is now under the control of the Israeli army, except for the sea lanes, which are still defended by British troops as their port of retreat.

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 17th] Jewish troops launched a fierce counterattack on the 17th against the Arab town of Lummle, nine miles away, with a population of 20,000, in an attempt to open up the important highway to Jerusalem. The town of Lummle now controls the supply line for 100,000 Jews in Jerusalem. The counterattack is being led by the Irgun party, which recently joined the Jewish army.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 18th] The holy city of Jerusalem has become a terror hell. The Jewish and Arab armies have repeatedly surrounded the city, and all hope of saving the holy city has vanished. Trapped in the core are 1,340 Jews inside the Old City. 15,000 Arabs are surrounding them, using the city walls and turrets to resist the counter-surroundings by Jewish troops who are trying to break through to relieve the trapped Jews inside the city. Outside these Jewish troops, countless Arab troops are surrounding the entire city of Jerusalem, completely cutting off contact between the Jews inside and outside the Old City and the outside world. The United Nations Truce Committee for Jerusalem, composed of the consuls of the United States, France, and Belgium, together with officials from the International Red Cross, are still using telephones to contact both sides of the war to achieve a truce. The Jewish side has agreed to accept a revised truce plan to make Jerusalem a neutral city under the responsibility of the International Red Cross. However, the Arab side is still awaiting approval from their "Commander-in-Chief," King Abdullah of Jordan.

### Soviet Union Recognizes the State of Israel; Britain Does Not Intend to Recognize it Temporarily

[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] The Soviet Union officially recognized the State of Israel on the 17th. Radio Moscow announced that Foreign Minister Molotov, after receiving a telegram from Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok requesting all countries to recognize the State of Israel, had notified Shertok that the Soviet government had decided to officially recognize the State of Israel and its provisional government, and hoped that the establishment of the sovereign state of Israel would help promote peace and security in Palestine and the Near East.

[United Press, London, 17th] The State of Israel has now been recognized by three countries: the United States, the Soviet Union, and Guatemala.

[Reuters, London, 17th] It is understood that Britain will not recognize the State of Israel during this period of turbulent military situation in Palestine. A British Foreign Office spokesman also denied that they had received any request for recognition from Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok. The spokesman also denied that Britain intended to send a political representative to Tel Aviv and Haifa. Sir Alec Kirkbride, who will serve as the British political representative in Palestine, has not yet left London for Jerusalem.

[Reuters, Belgrade, 17th] A Yugoslav official claimed that the establishment of the Jewish State of Israel is a reality, and that Yugoslavia is considering recognizing it and will announce it soon.

### US Senators Demand the Lifting of the Arms Embargo on the Middle East

[Reuters, Washington, 18th] Republicans and Democrats in the Senate unanimously approved President Truman's quick recognition of the State of Israel and demanded the lifting of the arms embargo on the State of Israel.

[Reuters, London, 17th] Political figures here believe that the fate of the State of Israel depends on two major factors: the advance of the Arab armies towards Tel Aviv and the possibility of the United States lifting the arms embargo on the Middle East. According to dispatches from Washington, President Truman summoned Secretary of State Marshall to the White House today to discuss the US government's policy of selling arms to the Israeli army. Afterwards, White House Press Secretary Ross revealed that the arms embargo on Palestine is still in effect, but it is expected that Truman and Marshall will take action soon.

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] US officials here stated that President Truman will not take any action to lift the arms embargo on the State of Israel until the Security Council clarifies the situation in Palestine.

### US Atomic Energy Commissioners' Terms Extended by Two Years

### United Nations Atomic Energy Commission Decides to Temporarily Suspend Activities; Soviet Union and Ukraine Vote Against

[United Press International, Success Lake, 17th] The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, after two years of fruitless efforts to reach an agreement on international atomic energy control, decided today by a vote of nine to two to suspend its activities. The United States, Britain, China, France, Belgium, Canada, Argentina, Syria, and Colombia voted in favor, while the Soviet Union and Ukraine voted against. This vote is tantamount to the commission halting all work on atomic control, pending the General Assembly or the Security Council overturning the Atomic Energy Commission's resolution. If that happens, the United States is prepared to bring the matter before the General Assembly for a full debate.

### Another Soviet Peace Offensive; Washington Remains Cautious; Stalin Endorses Wallace's Proposals

[United Press International, Washington, 18th] Soviet Premier Stalin's willingness to negotiate with the United States to resolve disputes has sparked speculation among officials here today that the Soviet Union is now pursuing a "peace offensive" with both diplomatic and propaganda aims. It remains to be seen whether the United States will respond and what the nature of that response will be. The White House and the State Department are maintaining silence, seeking to determine whether this is a ploy to mislead and weaken the United States, or a genuine change in policy. The U.S. needs to see clearly before taking the next step.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] An American official commented on the evening of the 17th on Stalin's public letter in response to Wallace, stating that it was an impolite action towards the head of the U.S. government and his ministers for a political leader to address a declaration on foreign policy to a foreign opposition party leader. The official also said that if such actions become commonplace, the exchange of opinions on diplomatic matters would become impossible.

[United Press International, London, 7th] Moscow Radio tonight broadcast Stalin's reply to the proposals of Wallace, the presidential candidate of the third party in the United States, stating that the Soviet Union is willing to accept Wallace's recent open letter as the basis for a peaceful resolution of U.S.-Soviet disputes, including in the Far East, but he does not know whether the U.S. government agrees to use Wallace's plan as the basis for a U.S.-Soviet agreement. From the perspective of the Soviet government, Wallace's plan should be a good and effective foundation for this agreement and the development of international cooperation. Stalin also compared Wallace's proposals with the letters exchanged between Smith and Molotov, saying that Smith's letters were far from adequate. It is claimed that the important significance of Wallace's open letter lies in its ability to go beyond mere words and further enumerate concrete steps for U.S.-Soviet reconciliation, which is undoubtedly the most important political document in the recent peace movement. Although Wallace's letter does not cover all the disputes between the two countries, and some of the parts he mentioned need to be improved, all these details are irrelevant at this time. What is important is that Wallace can openly and sincerely propose a concrete plan for the major premises of reconciliation on the basic disputes between the United States and the Soviet Union. Stalin also reiterated Wallace's suggestions as follows: (1) General disarmament and a ban on atomic weapons. (2) Conclude peace treaties with Germany and Japan and withdraw troops from those countries. (3) Withdraw troops from China and Korea. (4) Respect the sovereignty of all countries and do not interfere in their internal affairs. (5) No military bases should be established in the member states of the United Nations. (6) Develop international trade and assist the reconstruction of all countries within the scope of the United Nations without discrimination. (7) Maintain democracy and ensure civil rights in all countries, etc.

### Wallace Broadcast

Suggests That He Feels That He Should Express Happiness

[United Press International, Oakland, California, 18th] Wallace, who is currently on a speaking tour in the San Francisco area, declared today that his open letter to Stalin objectively pointed out the location of the world crisis, and Stalin's response, immediately following the Soviet newspaper's criticism of the letter, is of great significance, indicating that the Soviet government is indeed prepared to discuss various issues and is genuinely concerned about finding a way for the United States and the Soviet Union to coexist peacefully. He hopes that Washington can adapt to the aspirations of people around the world, achieve peace, and prevent a costly and dangerous war. He hopes that the domestic newspapers will objectively treat his open letter as a basis for full discussion and resolution of domestic and foreign affairs.

### U.S. Submits Proposal to Security Council: Issue Ceasefire Order for Holy Land; Soviet Representative Supports U.S. Proposal

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] New York, 18th Broadcast: Success Lake News, today Ukraine, following the Soviet Union, advocated stopping the war in Palestine, which is the same as the U.S. position. U.S. Representative Austin will request that the proposal for a ceasefire be put to a vote immediately, so that the Security Council can take practical action. If the Arab side still does not comply, military intervention may be considered.

[United States Information Service, Success Lake, 17th] The United States today asked the United Nations Security Council to demand that the governments of the warring parties in Palestine issue a ceasefire order, because according to the definition of the United Nations Charter, the current situation in the Holy Land constitutes a threat to peace. Representative Austin, when presenting this proposal, requested the Security Council to ask the Arabs and Jews questions in order to determine all the facts of the situation in the Holy Land. Arab representatives expressed opposition to the U.S. proposal. A Jewish spokesman said that Jews welcome this proposal and hope that the Arabs will also accept it. Soviet Representative Gromyko expressed support for the U.S. proposal.

[Reuters, Success Lake, 17th] Private talks between the five major powers, China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, to discuss candidates for the United Nations Palestine mediator failed to reach an agreement and will continue on the 17th.

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] London, 18th Broadcast: At the 47th annual meeting of the British Labour Party, most leaders believed that the nationalization plan for industrial countries allowed by the party in 1945 has been completed.

### Other Solutions to the City's Housing Shortage; Ministry of Finance Does Not Allow Restoration of Real Estate as Loan Collateral; China Trust Bureau Plans to Build and Sell Houses

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Municipal Council has repeatedly suggested to the central government that real estate be used as bank loan collateral to stimulate land finance and encourage housing construction to alleviate the housing shortage, but this has not been adopted. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has replied to the Council's fifth general meeting resolution, which has been forwarded to the municipal government, stating: "The Shanghai Municipal Council's proposal to quickly restore real estate as bank loan collateral and order national banks to handle real estate mortgage transfers is difficult to implement due to the limited funds of national banks. It is requested that it be temporarily handled according to current regulations. However, in order to encourage housing construction and solve the housing shortage, this year the China Farmers Bank has approved the handling of city land improvement loans (including housing construction loans) in major cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, and the bank is currently preparing a loan implementation plan. In addition, the China Trust Bureau, in view of the failure of past construction loans to quickly solve the housing shortage, plans to purchase land and build its own houses for sale by bidding. The principles for handling this are also being negotiated with the Ministry of Land Affairs for approval. This should help solve the current housing shortage."

### Prevent Hoarding and Smuggling to Aid Communists; Shanghai Rice Is Not Allowed to Leave the City; Non-Grain Merchants Are Not Allowed to Purchase and Hoard Rice; Endorsement Is Required After Each Transaction

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Executive Yuan believes that this city is the largest consumer city in the country, and the full-scale distribution of food has already begun. In order to prevent unscrupulous elements from hoarding and smuggling rationed rice to aid the communists, and to crack down on speculation and manipulation to stabilize people's livelihood, it has specially formulated measures and instructed the municipal government to strictly comply with them. The measures are recorded as follows: (1) Shanghai rice is not allowed to be transported out of the urban area. The government should, in conjunction with the Garrison Headquarters, issue a notice to the public to comply with it, and select cadres to strictly investigate and prohibit it in conjunction with the military police. Anyone who privately transports rice out of the country will be punished in accordance with Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Those Who Hinder National Mobilization. At the same time, the Executive Yuan will separately order customs and transportation agencies to strictly enforce it to prevent food from flowing out, so as to prevent hoarding and smuggling. (2) The management of the Shanghai grain market should be strengthened immediately. It should be stipulated that buying and selling should be conducted publicly in the market. Non-grain merchants are not allowed to purchase and hoard rice. Transactions must be conducted with cash on delivery. The quantity and purpose of the transaction should be registered in detail by the market management office. The quantity of grain stored by grain merchants and warehouses should be reported daily. (3) It is reported that the Shanghai grain market mostly uses warehouse receipts (or bills of lading) to buy and sell repeatedly, driving up grain prices and using grain as an object of speculative funds, causing grain prices to soar. This speculative trend is the main reason. It should be clearly stipulated that if warehouse receipts (or bills of lading) are used for transactions, they must be addressed, and the bill of lading must be endorsed after the transaction. Repeated buying and selling is not allowed, and the market manager is responsible for strict enforcement.

### Shipping Industry Requests Price Increase; Approval Reportedly Set at 35 Percent

Subsequently, the cinema industry association held a meeting of directors and supervisors, believing that the 20% increase was too small and could not make up for expenses, so it immediately decided to comply with the authorities' regulations for the lowest ticket price, only increasing it by 20%, while the rest would be automatically adjusted. The highest ticket price of 200,000 yuan has increased by 66% compared to the previous 120,000 yuan.

### A Two-Year-Old Child Is Addicted to Smoking; Comfortable with a Cigarette in Hand; Smoke Comes Out of the Nostrils; Protruding Abdomen Suspected of Having Worms

[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The sensational news of the Sichuan woman Yang Mei's "not eating" has recently aroused the interest of the medical community in the province and is being studied and observed in preliminary stages. Now, according to this newspaper's reporter, there is a child in this city who is under three years old who does not like toys or candy, but whose only hobby is smoking cigarettes. With a cigarette in hand, he is comfortable, which, like Yang Mei's not eating, is a strange thing. Liu Jinnian, 26 years old, from Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, fled to Shanghai with his wife, Liu Bai, and son, Yizhong, last year in the second lunar month because his hometown was harassed by bandits and his parents and brothers were killed. He makes a living by rowing a boat to transport soybean stalks and straw between Sijing and Shanghai. On the 28th of last month, Liu Bai suddenly fell ill with a disease and was sent to a hospital on Xizang Road for treatment. Liu sold his boat due to financial constraints and stayed in the hospital with his son Yizhong to accompany and take care of his wife. Unexpectedly, after Liu's son was admitted to the hospital, whenever he cried, his father would ask people for cigarettes for him to smoke, and he could turn his sorrow into joy. For a time, the whole hospital was talking about this strange thing. This reporter met Liu Jinnian at the hospital yesterday. He is an extremely simple countryman. According to him, neither he nor his wife like to smoke. Last year in the fourth lunar month, his son Yizhong happened to be crying non-stop. A friend happened to be smoking in the boat and carelessly gave him the cigarette to play with in order to stop him from crying. Unexpectedly, after Yizhong got the cigarette, he was able to swallow and spit freely, without any spicy or irritating feeling. From then on, whenever he cried, he would use cigarettes instead of toys and candy to stop him from crying, and he gradually became accustomed to it. Now he needs to smoke about three cigarettes a day. At this point in the conversation, the teahouse in the hospital gave the child a cigarette. He was able to hold the cigarette with two fingers on his right hand, and after taking a few puffs, the smoke came out of his nostrils. His skillful posture was surprising. The child is now three years old, but his actual age will be three years old on the 16th day of the sixth lunar month of this year. He can only say "Mommy" and cannot speak. He looks no different from ordinary people, but his face is sallow and he has two small braids on the side of his head. His expression is very dull. The child was once examined by a doctor in the hospital, and the results showed that his abdomen was protruding, which may be due to worms. However, it is impossible to understand why he can smoke cigarettes.

### The Town Leader of Datuan Township Defects with Weapons, Escorting Self-Defense Corps Members and Soldiers into the Sea, the Garrison Headquarters Telephones the Youth Army and Transfers Troops to Be Stationed to Search

Chu Guibin, the leader of Datuan Town in Nanhui, Pudong, was recently incited by Communist bandits. On the evening of the 15th of this month at 8:00 PM, he defected along with Xi Dexiang, the head of the self-defense force, leading more than ten subordinates. In addition to taking all the firearms from the town's self-defense force, they also confiscated the firearms of the self-defense forces and police from Nicheng and Machang Townships. The firearms taken included one heavy machine gun, four light machine guns, more than twenty carbines, more than seventy rifles, and more than forty handguns. They went out to the Sanzaogang sea port, took a boat, and sneaked off to Siming Island outside Jinshankou, a bandit area.

After this incident occurred, the local villagers and the police station immediately telegraphed the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. After receiving the report, the garrison immediately telegraphed the 202nd Division of the Youth Army to urgently dispatch a company of stationed troops to the town that night for stationing, strict vigilance, and searching. Furthermore, in order to avoid affecting the security of the garrison area, it has dispatched a large number of cadres to conduct a detailed investigation and research into the inside story of the case. Now that the Youth Army has been stationed in the town, it has returned to normal, and the position of town leader is temporarily being held concurrently by the police chief, it is said.

It is reported that Chu Guibin, who defected this time, was originally an old subordinate of the communist bandit Ding Xishan. He was a native of Laogang Town on the coast of Nanhui. During the war, he organized a guerrilla team and became acquainted with Ding, joining Ding's troops as a battalion commander. In 1944, when Ding Xishan surrendered to the enemy and became a puppet, Chu was unwilling to go along with him and secretly went to the mainland alone. He underwent training for a year and then was ordered to return to Nanhui to take charge of subversion work. After the victory, he was ordered to take the position of town leader of Datuan Town, which he held until now. This spring, when Ding Xishan was beheaded in Qingpu County, Chu secretly shed tears. The authorities feared that he would change, so they had taken precautions early, but this defection still occurred.

At that time, Xu Yangzhong, a staff officer of the puppet 13th Division, was an underground worker who was detected by the enemy and puppet, and escaped to Hou's place, and Hou sheltered him and left Shanghai. Only Zhuang knew about this, and used this to blackmail him. Later, Zhuang swept away and went away, and once instigated the enemy's highest advisor, Kageyama, to send a special letter to warn him. Then he reported to the puppet police chief, Ying, and Hou was detained in the puppet police station for a week. Zhuang also had a close relationship with the puppet health director, Ni Yuchang, etc. According to Zhuang, she claimed in court that during the occupation of Shanghai, Hou had close ties with No. 76, and was forced to separate, and was forced to work in the puppet health bureau for a living. After the victory, the assessment was still hired. As for Kageyama's letter, he said he did not know.

### The Export Management Committee Responds to the Demands of the Silk Industry to Ration Raw Silk to Factories, the Central Bank Allocates Two Hundred Loads of Silk for Trial Implementation

The Export Management Committee recently learned of the request from the silk weaving industry for the government to allocate raw silk as raw materials, so as to weave silk products for export in exchange for foreign exchange.

(3) Anyone who has an order form and wants to receive raw silk materials in advance must provide full security for the silk pieces before allocation can be approved, it is said.

Flour

Merchants all had the intention to raise prices from low levels, so the market prospered. Retail investors also took the opportunity to buy in short positions. Lao Che and Bing Chuan both closed at 1,830,000, Hong Feng and Jian Cheng both at 1,800,000, each higher than the previous day by 30,000.

### Self-Funded Students at Jiaotong University Unable to Pay Meal Fees

Delegates Sent to Beijing to Petition the Ministry of Education

Also Requesting the University to Quickly Find Ways to Provide Relief

[Our Newspaper] More than 250 self-funded students at Jiaotong University, due to the cessation of their sources of income, have not paid the meal fees due this month. The dining services have notified them that meals will be suspended. Delegates Yuan Guochang and Liu Guangyu were specially sent to Beijing the night before last to petition the Ministry of Education. This morning, they also invited the Dean of Academic Affairs, Zhou Ming, and the Dean of General Affairs, Cai Ze, of the university for a discussion on the lawn of the campus, requesting the university to quickly find ways to provide relief. Zhou and Cai explained the university's financial difficulties to the point of exhaustion, and stated that since President Cheng Xiaogang was in Beijing and had not returned, they were unable to grant long-term advances. In the end, Dean Zhou agreed in his personal capacity to transfer 30 million yuan from outside to solve the temporary difficulties. He also notified President Cheng Xiaogang in Beijing by long-distance telephone, requesting him to consult with the Ministry of Education in Beijing to find a solution. According to Dean Cai, there are more than 1,200 self-funded and partially self-funded students at the university. Previously, 400 students were registered as having their sources of income cut off and needing public funding for relief. 250 students have not yet paid their fees this month. Each person needs approximately 40,000 yuan per day, so these 250 students need more than 10 million yuan for meal fees. It is hoped that the student representatives who went to Beijing and President Cheng will find a solution to this problem within three days. It is reported that Mr. Zhou is currently suffering from lung disease and attended the discussion with students this morning despite his illness, showing a sincere and touching attitude. Dean Cai also did not eat or drink all day yesterday, engaging in day-long talks with the students.

### Spring Rain Night Talk

— Yuqin

"I have never seen the head of the rain. Maybe the rain really has no head? No, the rain has a head. But the head is very high. To see it is not the eye fortune that you and I mortals can casually enjoy. However, the feet of the rain are not difficult to see. I often see it, and I have also heard others talk about it. In an old poem, I still remember the sentences 'The feet of the rain come from the southeast' and 'The wind drives the feet of the rain back.' You have read Li Bai's poems, you should still remember his: 'White rain reflects the cold mountain, dense like silver bamboo'; isn't the silver bamboo he wrote about the rain feet I'm talking about?"

"Rain not only has a head and feet, but also has a temperament. What is the innate temperament of rain? From large, small, rapid, and slow, to divide: 'pouring rain' and 'silk-like drizzle' should be the expression of two kinds of temperaments, violent and gentle. In time, the former is mostly fierce in its arrival, and does not last long; the latter is mostly slow in coming, and continuous and endless. One is tyrannical and barbaric; the other is peaceful. It can also be said that one is masculine; the other is feminine and beautiful."

"You know, in the summer there is 'plum rain.' That is exactly what the poet said: 'In April, the weather is hot and muggy, and bitter rain first enters the plum.' Summer rain is regarded as bitter rain, perhaps because it is not as popular as wind; and it falls towards the heart of sour plums. 'Wutong rain' is even more frequently chanted by poets: 'Falling paulownia leaves in the rain,' 'Autumn rain when paulownia leaves fall,' these always carry a little so-called sense of autumn sadness. Winter rain should be called 'winter plum rain.' Because it is a full expression of tyrannical and barbaric temperament, there seem to be fewer poems chanting it, such as 'Rain connects with the dawn, falling on the remaining plums' are few and far between. Spring rain, it can be different from these. In the Song of Everlasting Regret, isn't there the sentence 'Jade face lonely, tear-stained railing, a pear blossom branch brings spring rain'? Pear blossoms with rain, here, have become the jade face of a beauty leaning on the railing and shedding tears. This sentence explains why Wang Huan overthrew the country, and also explains why pear blossoms are so beautiful and so endearing in the spring rain. What kind of rain is spring rain? What is the temperament of this kind of rain? What are the poet's feelings about this temperament? You should know."

"Night rain is a qin, playing a desolate tune alone in the high mountains and valleys. Look, aren't the rain threads the strings of the qin? Aren't the dripping sounds of rain the tunes played on the strings? 'The thick strings are noisy like rapid rain, the thin strings are soft like private whispers,' the varying degrees of loudness and softness and rapidity and slowness, aren't they variations of Gong and Shang? And you and I, aren't we the listeners of the qin heart?"

"Listening to the rain seems to be a very elegant term, especially on rainy nights, because of the stillness, it is easy to generate elegant interest. 'Lying down and listening to the sparse rain on the paulownia,' what a picturesque sentence! Also, those who like to 'keep the withered lotus to listen to the sound of rain' and regret 'not planting banana trees to listen to the rain,' how sad their moods must be!"

"Really, if the rain doesn't fall, you don't talk about it; once it falls, it is inevitable that you will. Once you listen to it, your mood seems to be grasped by it, making people think of many things that you usually don't have time to think about. 'The west window blows dark rain again,' can you stop your heart from listening? After listening, like the echo in an empty valley, your heart will definitely have a reaction. If you don't think of the long-torn calendar, then you plan for the things at hand or future hopes; this is inward thinking; what about outward thinking? There are really many, friends far away, do you still remember your childhood classmates? Lovers in red buildings, is your spring dream good? White hair in your hometown, shouldn't you be too burdened by family expenses..."

"You must be thinking, but I don't know what you're thinking about? Facing the 'Quietly locking a courtyard of sad rain, scattering the empty steps, the night orchid has not rested' tonight, although we do not have 'old friends cutting candles by the west window in the rain,' but are 're-invited to sleep listening to the rain,' since you are already listening to the rain, can you still not think?"

"I didn't think; no, I was thinking. But what I think about is not much, and what I can think about is what I want to think about. Who is that? It's neither a relative, nor a lover, nor a friend; but it's also a mother, a lover, a friend, it's all my dear, broad humanity. In this 'Chongqing merciless wind and rain' night, there must be many different people getting through it in different ways, but among many different people, those who are most unable to get through it and can't help but get through it are the people in low and dilapidated thatched huts, the kind of Du Fu's bitter situation in those years where 'there is no dry place on the bed due to the leaking roof, and the feet of the rain are like hemp and never stop,' must have been deeply savored, but you and I are lying comfortably in bed! Alas, lying comfortably in bed!"

Like an arrow, deeply shot into my lungs; like a lead stone, heavily pressed on my friend's heart. The rain is good, the spring night rain is especially good, but why would my friend and I, who are talking to each other in bed, 'hear the rain and spoil the spring dream'?

### Zheng Manqing's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition

— Ma Gongyu

Only you lightly depict flowering branches,
Beneath the red gauze tent, scholars gather like clouds;
You lightly teach the three perfections, yet you are old in Jiangnan,
Who in this era can match Guan Guangwen?

The landscapes of my hometown possess ancient purity,
But alas, the man of talent has fallen;
A single phrase from Yiyuan spreads the monthly critique,
From the West, everyone praises Zheng Qingteng.

For twenty years, his art has been like a gust of wind,
A fleeting life like a painting or mist;
All the myriad forms of the world return to his twin brushes,
Sold to the human realm, a connection to hills and valleys.

### Quick Chat After Watching a Play

— Li Puyuan

I missed the reception for "The Grudges and Gratitude of Daliang Mountain," written by Li Hongxin and directed by Hong Shen, the day before yesterday. Yesterday, thanks to the kindness of Mr. Lu Fuguang, a member of the play's production committee, I had the opportunity to watch the first act as a preview.

Mr. Li Hongxin lives with me, and I have been following the rehearsals of "The Grudges and Gratitude of Daliang Mountain" with great interest; moreover, I have always hoped that it would be staged soon, giving a fresh and powerful stimulus to this Shanghai life that has become utterly decadent.

Therefore, the "quick" in this "preview" is quite "unconventional"!

In fact, both "seeing" and "talking" about it are enjoyable.

Mr. Li Hongxin is a "slender and spirited" person. When I first met him, I only thought he was dark but handsome. His first work, "The Child Who Couldn't Be Given Away," was a lively and vivid one-act play. I never imagined that his "The Grudges and Gratitude of Daliang Mountain," now on stage, would have such profound depth and such grand ambition.

This play uses the character of Yang Wenhua, a middle school student, to represent the playwright's attitude, and uses various appropriate opportunities to declare the theme of the play. The theme is: the Han and Yi are one family, they should be equal, they should love each other, they should unite, they should not be suspicious of each other, and they should not hate each other because of their respective senses of superiority. This theme, in the current stage when all aspects of the country are seeking to promote the unity and welfare of the entire nation from various perspectives, is very correct and very worthy of cherishing; in my opinion, however, this spirit of engaging in the cultural and blood exchange between the borderlands and the Central Plains, between the majority and minority compatriots, is especially worthy of great praise. Without face-to-face contact with our minority compatriots in the borderlands, we Han people cannot avoid sitting in a well and looking at the sky, cannot avoid being self-important and arrogant. When we are face-to-face with these compatriots, we feel weak, we feel fragile, we feel that both our nerves and blood are aging, we feel that our suspiciousness, suspicion, and infighting… are self-inflicted troubles, self-inflicted decline, and are so petty that they are not even worth a smile! Indeed, the burden that society has handed over to us is heavy enough to carry, but to carry this burden requires broader shoulders, greater courage, fresher blood, and stronger vitality… These things are almost impossible to find in our current life, but there is plenty of them in the borderlands among our minority compatriots! To say nothing else, just looking at this performance of "The Grudges and Gratitude of Daliang Mountain," three hours of work, a dose of what Mencius called "the spirit of vastness and rectitude," I believe, will greatly inspire our lives! The theme of this play is good, and the ambition is even better!

The structure of this play arranges the "grudges" and "gratitude" very clearly in the introduction of the first act. The subsequent development is not diluted by the grand scenes of singing, dancing, fighting, and jumping through fire… The main thread is still proceeding step by step, forcing out the tragic outcome of five lives in a tumultuous manner; Mr. Hong Qianzai also always grasps the playwright's requirements, and handles the overall rhythm of the movements very appropriately; not to mention the sets, lighting, and costumes, which are generally consistent with the playwright's intentions, even the acting skills of the actors, Jiajia, Wushake, Shanlana, Yameng, Su…, are also competent and enjoyable—if I had to depict a bit of shadow, I think, we are Han people after all, our bodies are not strong enough, and our vitality is not sufficient enough!

However, these are ultimately minor details, aren't they? If we had more plays like this, more practice, then "human effort" can ultimately "overcome the grand," can't it?

### Calais Beach

— By English poet William Wordsworth, translated by Zhen Qin

It is a beautiful evening, a quiet, clear, and sacred time, as silent as a nun holding her breath in prayer; the vast sun is gradually setting in its tranquility; the great mercy of the heavens reigns over the sea: Hark! The great "Life" is awakening, using its eternal rhythm to emit a thunderous sound—unchanging throughout the ages. Dear girl accompanying me! If you seem not to touch sacred thoughts, your nature will not therefore be less noble: you lie all year round in Abraham's bosom, worshipping and praising in the inner temple, God watches over you, but we do not know.

[William Wordsworth (1770-1850) was an early and well-known English Romantic poet. This sonnet is one of the poet's masterpieces, written in Calais in 1802 and first published in the 1807 collection "Poems," with no title in the original. "Clear" in the first line, originally free, can be interpreted as free from clouds according to Wheeler. "Life" in the sixth line refers to the sea. The allusion used in the twelfth line can be found in Luke 16:22, where Lazarus lies in Abraham's bosom; but it usually refers to the dead.—Translator]

### Wang Anshi's Diary

— Chen Zuogao

During the Song Dynasty, diary writing gradually flourished, and many authors emerged. Such as Ouyang Xiu, Sima Guang, Zeng Bu, Zhao Bian, Zhang Shunmin, Huang Tingjian, Zhou Hui, Zhou Mi, Lu You, Fan Chengda, Cheng Zhuo, Zhou Bida, Huang Ji, Zou Shen, Zhao Gai, Zhang Fangping and others, all personally wrote diaries. Now, those who have seen their books or have their titles preserved are no less than dozens of families.

Wang Anshi's diary, with its vast number of volumes, is the crown of all the diaries of the Yan Song Dynasty, and few people have evaluated it. I will briefly describe it as follows, despite the expense of words. Anshi assisted Emperor Shenzong, famous for advocating new laws, and was posthumously named Wen and posthumously enfeoffed as Prince Shu in the early years of Shaosheng. His life deeds are detailed in the History of Song, Volume 326, Biography 86. According to the diary, it has now been lost; the number of volumes recorded in historical records also varies. The Art and Literature Chronicle of the History of Song states twelve volumes, Zhou Hui's Qingbo Miscellany says eighty volumes, and Zhao Delin's Houminglu says seventy volumes. It is likely that Hui was a person of the Southern Song Dynasty, only about fifty years away from the beginning of Xining; what Hui saw was naturally the complete volume. What Zhao saw may have been another copy. And what the History of Song says seems to be a fragment, which is also unknown. In short, according to the books of Zhou and Zhao, what Jinggong recorded was mostly criticisms of those who did not attach themselves to him. His personality was stubborn and he spared no detail. It is said that Cai Tiao's Northern Hunt Record of the Song Dynasty stated that Emperor Huizong never forgot his late father Emperor Shenzong's ambition to continue his legacy. When someone happened to sell Wang Anshi's diary, he happily exchanged it for ten bolts of silk. (See General Catalogue of the Complete Library of the Four Treasures)

The program included recitations of Czech poetry and prose in Russian translation, as well as talks on the development of Czech literature. The library also exhibited Slavic literature translated into Russian, including works by writers from Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, and Bulgaria.

It began with a speech by Alexander Fadeyev, Secretary-General of the Soviet Writers' Union. He spoke of the traditions of Czech literature, the close relationship between Russian culture and the Slavic peoples, and Fadeyev emphasized that both countries are close to the masses and have a spirit of freedom and lofty humanity. Speaking of mutual influence and the relationship with Western literature, Fadeyev said that Russian literature in the nineteenth century, especially after the time of the poet Zhukovsky, no longer relied on Western culture. Russian literature has long held an important place in world literature. Czech literature, after Wrkhlitski, no longer needs to rely on Western culture. The narrator added that, on the contrary, Western Europe still needs to learn from the Slavic peoples.

The audience warmly welcomed the Czech female writer J. Glazarova. She spoke of the influence of Russian literature on Czech literature, and that there are many translations of Soviet writers' works in Czech. She also said that there are many Czech writers' works translated into Soviet languages, for which she is very grateful.

Glazarova also spoke of the period of Hitler's terrifying occupation. The Nazi Party wanted to drive out Czech culture. Among those who sacrificed under Nazi bestiality were: journalist and literary scholar Julius Fucik, Joseph Capek (brother of Karel Capek), novelist Vladislav Vancura (who wrote the novel "Jan Margoul the Baker," initially called the Czech "Don Quixote"), poet and translator of Russian poetry Joseph Hora, famous humorist Karl Polak, famous writer and Nazi resistance fighter Jaroslav Kratohvil, and others. But Czech culture will not perish. The writers of the old era have been replaced by young writers who emerged during and after the war, including: Ivan Olbraht, a psychoanalytic novelist, female writer Maria Majerova, who wrote several novels about workers' struggles, and others such as Anna-Marie Tilsova and Stanislav Nenman.

Death of French Writer Jean-Richard Bloch

The famous French writer and anti-Nazi Jean-Richard Bloch has recently passed away. The Soviet "Literaturnaya Gazeta" published this news. The Soviet Writers' Union published a eulogy: "For many years, Bloch was a friend of our country and culture." When the Spanish people opposed Hitler's henchman Franco, Bloch was the first to go to Spain.

This anti-fascist writer left his homeland during the war and lived in the Soviet Union. Soviet writers still remember his anti-Nazi speeches. Thousands of underground French workers listened to his radio broadcasts. He broadcast from Moscow, praising the Soviet people's resistance to German aggression and encouraging his countrymen to learn from the Soviet Union and fight the invaders to the end.

Bloch returned to France with the dual qualifications of writer and anti-fascist. The eulogy said: "France's post-war democracy owes much to Bloch's courageous and sincere voice.

"We, his Soviet readers and friends, will always remember Bloch's moving personality, his selfless diligence and optimism, and his unwavering commitment to his responsibilities as a writer and fighter, even in the most difficult times."

The Soviet Writers' Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the editors-in-chief of "Soviet Literature" and "Literaturnaya Gazeta" have sent letters of condolence to the family, friends, and colleagues of the deceased.

### A Collection of Letters Seeking Jobs and Financial Aid

(1) Editor: I am a third-year student at Jiaotong University who has returned from the inland. Many students have probably told you about our living conditions and difficulties. Indeed, we have reached the end of our rope. Therefore, I hope to be able to take on a job such as a tutor during my spare time. I have long admired your willingness to help those in need, and I pray that you will publish this in your newspaper. Thank you very much. Zhong Xianzheng (Room 330, Jiaotong University, Xujiahui)

(2) Editor: I am a poor student at Jiaotong University. I was admitted to a national university and also received public funding. In the eyes of most people, I am already a star in heaven. However, my presence among the stars may tarnish heaven! My father is a small civil servant, and his monthly income cannot support a "family of seven." Where would he get the money for his children's education? In the past, I relied entirely on work-study grants from the student relief association to support myself. However, the work-study program has not paid out in more than two months. The cut off of economic resources has left me at a dead end. Although I only have fourteen months left to graduate, the current difficulties are still difficult to overcome. Fortunately, I still study hard on weekdays, and I believe I still have an interest in English. I sincerely hope to take on a job as an English teacher at a night school or as a tutor to maintain my studies. Sincerely, Wu Hengshun, third-year student at Jiaotong University.

(3) Editor: Ten years of wandering, I don't know how many stops. My home has been destroyed by the flames of war, and my source of income has been cut off. I often think of working and studying, but I have not been able to find a way. The pain of interrupted studies is imminent. Sir, do you also sympathize with me? I am currently studying at Jiaotong University as a third-year student. I am willing to work as a tutor for students in elementary or middle school. I pray for your help. Sincerely, Wang Chaodian (Room 308, Zhongyuan, Jiaotong University)

### The Sorrow of Old Age

— Mao Zishui

The difference between humans and other higher animals, or the difference between people with higher culture and people with lower culture, is of course many. The easiest to see is in the ability and degree of "reflection." Reflection is the recollection of past behavior and the identification of their right and wrong, good and evil. (Needless to say, the so-called right and wrong, good and evil here are naturally based on the interests of the entire human race as the standard.) Reflection seems to be the greatest driving force for human cultural progress. I believe that the distinction between "upper-class people" and "lower-class people" should not be based on the height of their status or the difference in their occupations, but should be based on the degree of their reflection. Among the people Confucius admired most in his life, there was Qu Boyu. Legend has it that Qu Boyu did not realize the errors of his past behavior until he was fifty years old. This of course refers to the right and wrong, good and evil in the ethical sense. If we take the ordinary meaning, for example, if a person writes a word wrong or plays a card wrong, he can immediately realize it, so why wait until after his fiftieth birthday? I think Confucius admired Qu Boyu because he had this ability to reflect.

But reflection can give us great distress! If a person lives his whole life in a muddle-headed way, then there is nothing to say. If he has some ability to reflect, then when he gets older and his mind gradually becomes clearer (this idea may arise from the unfounded self-esteem of an old man), he will definitely feel "regret" for his past mistakes. "Regret" is certainly a good thing; "irreversible" is the most distressing. No matter how small a thing is, as long as it has happened, it will leave an indelible mark. Of course, if a person knows his mistakes and is able to resolutely correct them, he can not only remedy the past, but also create a new life. The sages of the past said: "To err and not to correct is to err indeed!" "All things past are like yesterday's death; all things to come are like today's birth." These words are the most appropriate and useful instructions for human behavior. Unfortunately, this realization of one's own faults often comes very late. Qu Boyu's story may have been fabricated by the ancients to encourage people, but a thoughtful person will of course be more able to know his own faults as he gets older. To know one's faults and be able to correct them is naturally a kind of happiness in life. But "the sunset is infinitely beautiful, but it is near dusk." I think there must be many old people in the world who have this sorrow.

Young people are different. If a young person can realize his faults early and correct them early, this "irreversible" regret will not only be less than that of an old man, but may even be non-existent. In this sense, the true distress in the world belongs only to old people, and young people should never have it.

This is still speaking from a negative point of view. If we speak from a positive point of view, we can even more clearly show this truth. The story of Zhou Chu in the Jin Dynasty is truly a "youth" story, which old people would probably not be able to do. It is distressing for a person to regret the past, and it is also a most distressing thing for a person to look forward to the future and feel "powerless" and "sigh at the vastness of the ocean"! Young people, on the other hand, have "a long way to go." As long as they work hard to do good things, "nothing is difficult in the world," and they will not end up achieving nothing.

Therefore, we can say that as far as human behavior is concerned, only old people have distress, and young people should not have distress. As for worldly human feelings, old people are aging and ugly, and they are annoying everywhere. Young people are not so. This is also a special distress for old people. I will not go into detail, because I am afraid it will cause too much sadness to my "peers"!

A good person always hopes that the world will get better day by day, and that human beings will be happier day by day. Therefore, good old people all hope that the young people in the world will take them—the old people—as a lesson, be able to "reflect" early, and move forward on the bright road. If there is anything in this world that can dispel the distress of old people, it is this hope. If the young people in the world make this hope more and more distant, then thoughtful old people will definitely feel the greatest distress!

### Famous Clown Liu Gansan

— Chen Yixian

Dr. Mei has been performing here in recent years. The first play is always "Female Escort," and the person who plays Chong Gongdao with him used to be written as Xiao Changhua. This time, he is performing at the Tianchan Theater and has been changed to Ru Fuhui. Probably Ershun (Xiao's nickname) is too old and cannot come again. Famous clowns in Peking opera are gradually declining. There are many plays that cannot be paired with good clowns, and even the famous sheng and dan are diminished in color.

I went to the old capital to study at the age of eighteen, which was in the 30th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. I still got to see Luo Baisui, who played Jiang Gan in "Heroes' Meeting" and Laoqie in "Heaven's Retribution" very well. His signature plays were "Ronghua Ji," "Twelve Reds," and "Wang Daoshi Captures the Demon," and those who watched it were amazed. However, the older generation said that Baisui was not as good as Liu Gansan. Although the two people's performance styles are different, there must be differences in the level of their cold and vivid performances.

I heard that one day, Gansan was performing at a Wangfu tanghui, singing the play "Prostitution." He played an old procuress who came out and saw the three princes, Prince Dun, Prince Gong, and Prince Chun, sitting in the front row in the center. He looked at the three princes and shouted, "Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh, come out to meet the guests!" Prince Gong laughed, Prince Chun was silent, but Prince Dun was furious and ordered someone to drag Gansan off the stage and beat him with military sticks. After the beating, he was still ordered to perform the play. Emperor Guangxu was the son of Prince Chun, and Emperor Xianfeng ranked fourth, Prince Dun ranked fifth, Prince Gong ranked sixth, and Prince Chun ranked seventh. Gansan's use of Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh to refer to the three princes was indeed too much of a prank, but Prince Dun's anger and beating of people for this reason was a bit too unromantic.

The most important condition of a democratic country is freedom of speech. However, this matter is difficult to say. The more a country claims to be democratic, the less the people can speak. The Travels of Lao Can says: "In general, there are two places where people speak from their stomachs. One is from below the dantian, which is their own words, and the other is from below the throat, which is polite words." The reason why Youmeng's clothing and hat are valuable is that they can speak the words from below the dantian for others, and express dissatisfaction with politics or figures in a humorous and witty tone, to the best of their ability to mock and scold. Such a famous clown is not easy to get again now.

### Spring Outing Grass

— Sanmu

It's time for the wild rice stems to be reaped early,
Before the lamp, a thousand strokes are still roughly drafted.
When the wine is drunk, I urge the guests to leave some dregs,
I want to draft an evil poem for Xu Lingxi.

Wu Zixu Shrine at the Mouth of Xujiang River

The upstream situation should not be moved,
Grass fills the steps in front of Wu Zixu's shrine.
Each dynasty's plans of deer and laughter,
His lifelong ambitions belonged to Louzhi.
The spring rain is bleak along the shore,
The wind shakes the flags of the garrison soldiers at the corner of the hall.
Why bother with the tide that overflows in Qiantang,
In autumn, it still catches up with the tide riders!

Leaving the Mouth of Xujiang River and Entering Lake Tai, Gazing at the Mountains of Linwu

Gazing at the distant sky,
The floating snails gradually become intimate.
Water surrounds the dragon's lair,
Mountains line up like imperial stars.
Wanting to retire like the old men of Shangshan,
Come to exhaust the spring of Zhenze.
If purple fungi can be gathered,
I should allow myself to fish here.

Leaving, leaving, the immortal source is near,
Fish and dragons are quiet and do not clamor,
Floating waves, the fishing rafts are stable,
Green dots, the merchant sails are far away;
Mist embraces the mountains and they are completely lost,
The wind turns and the rain becomes even more proud.
Sitting, I suspect I am outside the human realm,
True companions are sure to want to meet.

### Thoughts on the National Games

— Wu Yong

For more than ten years, whenever social unrest occurred, whether political or economic, the authorities invariably issued grand pronouncements about "treating the symptoms," "treating the root cause," or "treating both symptoms and root cause simultaneously." Yet, after so many years of "treating," neither the "root" nor the "symptoms" have moved an inch; they remain as they were. Why is this so? I believe the reason is quite simple: it's because they haven't truly engaged in the work of "treatment." In other words, it's due to the "incompetence" of government agencies and the lack of emphasis on "efficiency" in handling affairs. The root of most corruption in our country lies in these two words: "incompetence." In my view, this issue is extremely serious. Even after the suppression of the rebellion is complete, if this root cause isn't eradicated, I fear nothing will improve.

Take this National Games, for example. Several things clearly indicate a lack of coordination and inadequate planning in the handling of affairs. Consider the National Games, a major event. It shouldn't be hard to foresee the congestion of the crowds within the stadium. Our Mayor Wu is truly capable; he did think of the "convenience" issue beforehand. According to his estimate, "it would be best to have toilets capable of accommodating five hundred people within the stadium in order to collect tickets at the front gate of the venue. Otherwise, if the issue of urination and defecation isn't resolved, it will become a major problem." However, on the eve of the opening ceremony, when Mayor Wu inquired in detail with the person in charge of the venue, this person only "silently recalled" that there was one chamber pot here and two bedpans there, and only then did they discover that there were a total of twenty-one chamber pots and only seven urinals. Moreover, some of the water tanks were leaking, and the areas around some of the chamber pots were covered in sewage. "Two washbasins were still being hastily assembled." The Mayor asked, "Why haven't they been completed by now?" The staff member replied, "They were completed, but they broke, and they are currently being repaired." When asked about the urinals, the staff member said, "The original plan was to build them, but now, due to insufficient manpower, we had to omit them."

I used to be a sports enthusiast and originally planned to go to the venue to watch, but after reading this news report, my enthusiasm waned considerably. I thought perhaps other troubles would arise. Sure enough, on the afternoon of the first day of the Games, someone returning from the venue told me that the railing of the stands had collapsed, injuring many people. Upon hearing this news, I was half-doubtful and half-believing. I thought that the railing of the stadium stands was such an important piece of equipment within the venue, not something made of children's building blocks. How could it collapse? The railings of the racetracks in the city haven't been heard to collapse in all these years. It must be some malicious person spreading rumors. However, "things didn't go as wished." According to the next morning's newspaper report, it was indeed true. Some people were injured by falls, and some had broken arms. A total of thirty-two men and women were injured. The sequel to this incident will naturally be "investigating responsibility" – and after that, it will probably not have any sequel.

Furthermore, for example, many spectators bought tickets but couldn't enter the venue. According to the results of "investigating responsibility," it was said that it was because many people entered the venue without tickets, causing excessive crowding. In this way, the responsibility was pushed onto the spectators, and the ticket-buying spectators are also part of the spectators, so there's nothing more to say, and it "should be beyond discussion." Also, for example, on the eleventh, due to rain, all competitions were suspended. The refereeing staff, because they didn't receive notification of the suspension of the competitions, still braved the rain to go to the venue to perform their duties. As a result, they were left empty-handed and couldn't help but complain, accusing the person in charge of "making fun of them." Matters such as these fully demonstrate the "independent spirit" of "you are you, and I am me," just as one reporter said: "As long as the 'opening ceremony' and 'completion ceremony' are done, and the 'music is played,' no one cares if people die afterward." In fact, it's also questionable whether anyone in the government cares if people have died before the "completion ceremony" and "music playing."

The most wonderful thing is that in the 10,000-meter long-distance final, runner Lou Wen'ao "was intentionally blocked by several runners midway." It is said that as a result of being blocked, Mr. Lou dodged left and right, darting east and west, trying to break through the encirclement, resulting in strides that resembled dancing. Some commentators say that such behavior lacks sportsmanship but instead uses statesmanship to engage in sports. I feel that this kind of behavior is also like filibustering in the American Congress. Excellent, excellent!

### The Fire Walkers

— Mao Yi

In the South Pacific, there's the Fiji Islands, a group of 250 islands of various sizes inhabited by nearly 200,000 natives. Every year during the "Wilaviairevo" festival, they hold a fire-walking performance, which foreigners call the "Fire Walking Festival." During the performance, the natives walk and dance barefoot on white-hot rocks. They don't use any magic, nor do they apply any ointment to the soles of their feet, yet they are able to avoid being burned at all. Since white people conquered these islands, their powerful military has been consistently amazed by the natives' fire-walking performances. The Fijian performers appear to be in no pain whatsoever, nimbly walking on the scorching rocks without even a blister forming on their feet.

Before the performance, a shallow circular pit about thirty feet in diameter is dug in the ground, filled with dry branches and firewood. Then, a fire is used to ignite the firewood, and stones are rolled into the blazing pit. The stones are heated in the pit for about half a day. The next step is to spread fresh green leaves on the white-hot stones, creating a burst of steam. While the steam is billowing, the performers walk barefoot into the fire pit and begin a "folk dance." If foreign observers didn't think about the hot stones beneath the fire-walkers' feet, they might truly feel a sense of "floating like immortals."

But have the Fijian natives really developed bodies of steel, impervious to fire and heat? No. To be frank, the fire-walking performance can only be categorized as a "magic trick" – the key lies in "each having a different skill." It turns out that the entire Fiji Islands are volcanic in origin. The stones on the islands were originally formed by volcanic eruptions and cooling, so they have many pores. Even when heated to a white-hot state, they don't retain heat. Furthermore, the thick layer of green leaves covering the stones further protects the fire-walkers' feet, making it like dancing on a green leaf rug. If volcanic stones were replaced with pebbles from the beach, the Fijian natives would definitely "politely decline."

### The Blind Historian

— Song Xian

More than a hundred years ago, an American youth named Prescott unfortunately suffered severe eye injuries while playing with classmates, and one eye was completely shattered. He stayed in the hospital for months, sleeping in a dark room every day. Although he was treated by many famous doctors, his remaining half of an eye still couldn't regain its sight.

He勉力 finished university and then worked in his father's law firm. However, his eye still ached. After various treatments, it only got worse. So he had to live in a dark room, completely blacked out, where even the tables, chairs, and bed were invisible. His daily exercise was limited to groping around the room for a walk.

A gifted young man trapped in a semi-disabled state – his future was probably hopeless. However, the reality was not so. Prescott, with his remarkable perseverance, finally completed a great work. In the dark room, he completed sixteen thick books, becoming a famous historian!

Day after day, he sat in the pitch-black room, carefully listening to his assistant read countless reference books. He memorized them in his mind, then listed the outlines. After a long period of thinking and organizing, he dictated his works paragraph by paragraph. He spent thirty-nine years living such a tedious life, completing sixteen books, including histories of Spain, Mexico, and Peru. Their content was clear and fair, and they have been internationally recognized as standard historical works.

In the last ten years, his eyes were almost completely blind, and his heart gradually deteriorated. Yet, he remained optimistic and excited.

"Don't think I'm depressed because of this. No! I won't be. My interest will beat faster than usual, just like my pulse!" he said.

Prescott's courage was by no means the courage of a commoner, nor was it the courage of an explorer or speculator who risked everything on success or failure, life or death. His courage enabled a semi-disabled person to maintain his confidence and optimism in the dark world, day after day, for decades. This is the courage of calmness, persistence, and hard work.

Lang Qian Ji Wen (written by Chen Kangqi) narrates that his younger brother, a court secretary, loved to collect ancient inkstones and only collected those with poetry, prose, or seal carvings. He once arranged for "Inkstone Annotations," collecting a wide range of information. This is the most discerning and tasteful. The inscriptions of praise and poems are mostly elegant and refined, suitable for wear and contemplation, which benefits the mind and body. This is the first benefit. Having the handwriting of the ancients on the desk is like meeting them face-to-face, forging an ancient friendship. This is the second benefit. When we buy old calligraphy rubbings, we can only get their paper copies, not the original stones. Even if we could, as Ye Changchi wrote in his diary, "During the Dragon Boat Festival, he obtained a stone railing from the bridge and transported it to Beijing by large cart, alarming the streets." This can be called a good thing. In my opinion, it's not only a good thing but downright foolish. Inkstones, on the other hand, are small and exquisite, with ancient carvings, convenient for display and easy to rub, allowing them to be given to friends and entrusted to letters. This is the third benefit. The inkstones I have obtained all have good inscriptions or elegant phrases. I bought several inkstones of Ji Xiaolan, knowing that they were imitations, but I kept them because I liked their words. One is very large and thick, an irregular elliptical shape with a green edge. The inscription reads: "Neither square nor round, neither dull nor carved, slightly polished, virtue is imperceptible. Like metal in the furnace, like jade separated from the rough stone. Yuzhou has many talents, exceeding all others. Meeting in a room, a gentleman's pleasure." The words are excellent, but the calligraphy and engraving are mediocre, not a high-level imitation. Another is small and square, with a "double ring" interlocked seamlessly on the front ink pool and below. On the back is inscribed, "Welcoming the ring can be solved, I dare not know. What cannot be solved, solve it with non-solution." Philosophical meaning, concise and witty words, elegant calligraphy, and neat engraving. It is very convenient to use as a paperweight. All of these, although not the original objects of Ji, are imitated based on the originals. Therefore, imitations may not be unworthy of appreciation.
