### American Ships Loaded with Military Supplies to Arrive in China Within Two Weeks; Over One Hundred Million US Dollars in Military Aid Funds Already Allocated

[Central News Agency, Washington, 31st (Associated Press)] It is learned that the first batch of "substantial" American military supplies to aid the Chinese government will be rushed to China within two weeks. This batch of military supplies was originally scheduled to be shipped by chartered vessels in December, but now will be transported by army and navy vessels, thus avoiding the impact of the West Coast shipping strike. At the same time, a State Department spokesman stated that the US government has already allocated $100.5 million in military aid funds to the Chinese government, which is 85% of the $125 million allocated by Congress to aid China in suppressing the communists. According to the State Department's last report on the aid situation, issued on October 11, it was stated that $88,275,000 had already been handed over to the Chinese government. The person announcing the above news declined to specify the nature of this "substantial" batch of military supplies, only stating that it is currently being handled by the Army Ordnance Department, which likely means that it includes various guns, ammunition, tanks, and military vehicles. If there are any aircraft in this batch of military supplies, it is believed that the US Air Force will be responsible for shipping them. The news of the military supplies being shipped to China coincides with gloomy news from Nanjing. A senior Chinese official here admitted that the situation is quite serious, but he stated that the various speculations circulating are far from the truth. Currently, the Congressional Committee overseeing foreign aid is closely monitoring the situation in China. Recently, the committee announced the appointment of former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bullitt, as a special envoy to China to investigate the country's situation in order to make recommendations to Congress. Bullitt recently severed political ties with Truman. He is scheduled to depart for China on the 9th of this month. Both Bullitt and the committee chairman, Bridges, are well-known figures who advocate providing more military aid to China. After the announcement of Bullitt's mission to China, it is widely believed that if Dewey is elected president, the US government's policy towards China will quickly change. According to the current procedure, China must use the funds allocated to it by the US State Department to purchase the military supplies it needs. The State Department cannot participate in the procurement of military supplies, but the US military authorities can assist in procurement at the request of the Chinese side. It is learned that the Army has already obtained the military supplies it is waiting to ship to China.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 31st] The US State Department announced tonight that to date, out of the $125 million in military aid funds for China, $100.5 million has now been allocated to the US Army, Navy, and Air Force to purchase weapons, ammunition, and other military equipment to be delivered to China. A State Department spokesman stated that the State Department had reported to President Truman on October 7 that $8.5 million had already been allocated to China in the aid to China plan, but since that time, the Chinese government had increased its orders for weapons, ammunition, and other war materials. He stated that the State Department does not yet know how much of this amount is for the use of the Chinese Army, Navy, and Air Force, but all of these new orders were placed by the Chinese government with the purchasers before the recent military developments in the Northeast. The spokesman pointed out that the State Department expects to announce in one day the allocation of another several million dollars in aid funds to the Chinese government.

### New York Times Editorial Comments on the Loss of Shenyang

Zhang Criticizes the US Government's Policy Errors

[Associated Press, New York, 1st] A New York Times editorial on the 1st, commenting on the fall of Shenyang, stated: "Although Europe must still occupy a priority position in defending against communism, we must not ignore the crisis of Red Asia to the world."

The newspaper stated: "China, due to its industrial backwardness and the extensive destruction during the War of Resistance, must rely heavily on foreign aid in its fight against the Communist Party. The fall of Shenyang not only caused China to lose the rich Northeast provinces, but also illustrated the following fact: this vast and wealthy region was seized from the Japanese, intended to be returned to China, but is now being taken away by the Soviet Fifth Column in a manner similar to the Japanese conquest of the Northeast."

After mentioning China's difficulties and urgent need for assistance, the newspaper continued: "The United States, which once caused difficulties for China with its silver policy and acquiesced in the Soviet Union's expansion of power in the Northeast, has been hesitant to provide such assistance. Because, contrary to the US European policy, the United States does not have a two-ocean policy of aiding China at the same time. The administration initially hoped to bring the Chinese Communist Party into the Chinese government, then canceled the already approved loans, and imposed an arms embargo on China. Under Republican pressure, this policy began to change, but the military aid passed by Congress in April has not yet had a single item arrive in China."

The newspaper stated: "All previous dire warnings about the impending collapse of the Chinese government have been safely overcome due to China's strength. "We still hope that China's tenacity will be able to overcome all difficulties again."

### Although the Northeast Has Suffered a Setback, the Overall Situation is Not in Danger; The President Explains at the KMT Central Political Committee Meeting

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Kuomintang Central Political Committee meeting was held on the morning of the 1st. During the meeting, President Chiang explained the situation in the Northeast, frankly stating the process of the fighting and the reasons for the failure. He also stated that although the Northeast war has suffered a setback, it is still difficult for the main force of the Communist bandits to directly threaten the situation in North China. Furthermore, Commander Fu's fighting spirit and strategic application are both extremely brave and well-prepared. The Supreme Command has also made timely deployments to strengthen combat power, so the overall situation must be safe. We should accept the lessons of failure, strengthen our confidence, remedy our shortcomings, and make improvements in all aspects in order to reverse this serious setback and stabilize the overall situation. Then, Premier Weng reported on the meeting of the Executive Yuan, and the committee members believed that the supplementary measures to the emergency measures for finance and economy were very necessary as a temporary solution, and hoped that the authorities would quickly plan and decide on a fundamental solution to seek fundamental economic stability.

### Legislative Yuan Finance and Economics Committee Subcommittee Meeting; Discusses Stabilizing People's Livelihood Plan; The Government Should Grasp Important Materials to Maintain Currency Value

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The nine-member subcommittee previously appointed by the Legislative Yuan Finance and Economics Committee to draft a plan to stabilize the currency system and stabilize people's livelihood held its first meeting on the morning of the 1st. Chairman Huang Yuanbin, Deputy Minister of Finance Xu Baiwei, Advisor Zang Qifang, Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce Zhang Zizhu, and Director of the Control Department Fei Mingyang were all present. First, Xu Baiyuan explained the reasons for the change in the price limit policy in the supplementary measures for economic management announced on the 31st, briefly stating that the failure of the price limit policy was due to the abundance of floating capital and the uneven implementation results in various regions, which affected the circulation of materials, leading to the disappearance of goods from the market and the skyrocketing of black market prices, creating the recent serious economic situation. In order to take care of people's livelihood and stabilize society, the government made the decision to implement supplementary measures. However, the announcement on the 31st is only a part of the entire set of supplementary measures for financial and economic reform. The rest of the set of measures will be determined by major policies and will continue to be announced and implemented in the short term to eliminate the current financial and economic crisis. Xu stated that regarding the implementation of adjusting the treatment of public education personnel, the Executive Yuan will listen to the opinions of the Legislative Yuan after the Public Officials' Salary Law completes the legislative process, and formulate specific measures based on the principles of the supplementary measures. After Xu's report, Bao Huaguo and others first raised questions about the technical and standard issues of price determination for daily necessities and industrial raw materials. After Zhang Zizhu answered them one by one, they began a wide-ranging discussion. Finally, Huang Yuanbin, Lu Yuwen, Wu Gan, Wang Menglin, Bao Huaguo, and others were approved to organize the opinions of the committee members and draft a preliminary plan. Summarizing the key points of the speeches of the committee members, it was generally agreed that the four contents of the supplementary measures for economic management announced on the 31st were too empty, and the government lacked sufficient preparation for the implementation of various principles, which was not enough to cope with the current financial and economic crisis. Therefore, it is still necessary for the Legislative Yuan to research and propose a plan. Regarding finance, the committee members believed that it is essential to effectively save expenditures and raise revenue to tighten issuance. Regarding finance, some advocated opening up foreign exchange and free trading, and controlling material management of import and export trade, while others advocated that all foreign exchange operations should be managed by the government to prevent national wealth from being obtained by a few special interest groups. Most committee members unanimously believed that issuing hard currency is a powerful measure to stabilize currency value. Regarding the control of prices, the committee members all pointed out that the government must grasp several important materials, such as fuel and food, to maintain the purchasing power of the gold yuan and use them as standards for other prices. The pricing of prices must be reasonable and should be done through the organization of trade associations, acknowledging the legitimate profits of merchants and maintaining the balance of the national market. The committee members were all extremely concerned about the current situation, and they reasoned and planned based on academic theory and reality, speaking enthusiastically until the meeting adjourned at noon.

### Coal Shortage in the Nanjing-Shanghai Area is Severe

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The coal shortage in the Nanjing-Shanghai area has reached a severe stage. After the establishment of the Coal Adjustment Committee, the responsible parties have begun to plan ways to solve the coal shortage. According to authoritative sources, the current coal shortage is not due to a lack of coal sources, but due to the inability to control transportation. The responsible authorities are actively consulting with the Ministry of National Defense and will request the Ministry of National Defense to order the local garrisons not to detain coal transport vehicles and ships.

### Fighting Still Occurring Around Shenyang; Last Plane Flying from Beiping to Shenyang Evacuates Four People

Having accomplished the task of annihilating the bandits, they have safely transferred to the designated area. In the Liaonan area, our army has driven back the bandits on both sides of the Dashiqiao-Haicheng section of the China Changchun Railway. The situation in Yingkou is as calm as ever.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 31st] China News Agency: At noon on the 31st, a plane flew from Beiping to Shenyang to pick up relevant personnel from Shenyang. Because the situation at Hunhe Airport was dangerous, it circled for a long time at an altitude of a thousand feet before forcibly landing. Before it could stay for a moment, a shell grazed the fuselage. The pilot immediately took off, and four people were evacuated with the plane. This was the last plane to leave Shenyang.

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 1st] It is learned that air transport between here and Shenyang was interrupted on the 31st. Since the 31st, no more civil aviation planes have traveled back and forth.

Editorial

### Watching Today's US Presidential Election

The US presidential election, which attracts global attention, began today. All 95 million voters nationwide will cast their sacred votes, choosing between Dewey and Truman. How the voting will result, on the eve of the vote, we cannot make any rash pronouncements, and both sides have the confidence to win. For example, Truman stated in his hometown, "The Democratic Party will definitely win this election!" Dewey declared in New York, "The eve of victory has arrived!" However, according to opinion polls conducted by various sectors in the United States, Dewey is expected to be the most likely to be elected president, and even if we judge with common sense, we believe Dewey's victory is more certain. Therefore, this US presidential election has a very significant impact on US domestic and foreign policy and even the world situation, and it is indeed worthy of our attention.

Since the late President Roosevelt of the Democratic Party entered the White House in 1933 and implemented the New Deal, the Democratic Party has held power for nearly sixteen years. Its achievements for the United States and the world are forever indelible in the hearts of the American people, not only saving the US economic crisis but also eliminating the threat to the American way of life. Logically, the Democratic Party's victory is not a problem. However, the domestic and international situation after the end of the war was not always satisfactory. The urgency of the post-war world crisis increased the United States' sense of responsibility to the world, and President Truman's foreign policy inevitably wavered. Neither the "Truman Doctrine" touted by President Truman nor the "Foreign Aid Plan" presided over by Secretary of State Marshall was universally and thoroughly implemented, so that the United States retreated step by step and fell behind in the "Cold War," especially in Asia, where not only Southeast Asia has felt the threat of communism, but Northeast Asia will also fall into the hands of the Communist International. The policy toward China has created a historic mistake, causing the Democratic Party to lose the confidence of the American people. Coupled with the internal crisis in the United States, especially the shadow of economic panic, casts a shadow over everyone's heart, thus creating a sense of weariness and disappointment among the American people towards the Democratic Party. Weariness and disappointment led to a "change of heart," giving the Republican Party an opportunity to make a comeback. In fact, Dewey's hope of winning lies here.

In terms of the essence of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party, there is not much difference at all. General constitutional scholars criticize the two major parties in the United States, saying: "The Democratic and Republican parties are like two wine bottles with different labels. On the surface, they look like two kinds of wine with completely different properties, but when you open the bottles, they are empty." According to this, we do not need to have excessive expectations for the change of the White House host from Truman of the Democratic Party to Dewey of the Republican Party; in any case, the US national policy will not have major changes in principle. However, when implementing national policy, the change of the two parties will inevitably have different priorities, especially Marshall's "Europe first, Asia later" foreign aid policy. Whether Dewey will inherit the mantle is a question. According to reports, Dewey has criticized the Democratic Party's policy toward China, saying: "The Truman government not only lacks a policy to promote peace, but instead helps the Soviet Union to invade the world everywhere; in the Far East, the United States does not hesitate to sacrifice China and compromise with Stalin, allowing him to control northeastern China." Mr. Bullitt was soon ordered to come to China to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the political situation in China, and will inform Dewey of what he has seen and heard at any time. Therefore, we expect that after Dewey is elected president, at a minimum, the US policy toward China will definitely be changed.

However, according to US constitutional practice, the new president will not be able to take office at the White House until January 20 next year. From November to January 20 next year, it can be said to be a "vacuum" period in American politics. In today's world, where the global pressure is low and people are uneasy, we cannot help but feel anxious and fearful about the two-month US "political vacuum" period. Although some people have suggested that if the election is revealed, once Dewey is elected, Dewey should immediately issue a declaration and announce the policies of the new government in advance, it is doubtful what kind of stabilizing power this declaration has. We believe that the only way to solve the problem now is to appeal to the sense of responsibility of the Truman government in the face of the critical situation. If we can imitate Roosevelt's election as president, the former President Hoover, before handing over the office, took the lead in soliciting Roosevelt's political views on major events. In these two months, President Truman can fully understand that the serious situation today has made the United States unable to go beyond the constitutional norms and immediately implement the new policies announced by the next president to fill this "political vacuum," it will be of great benefit to the United States and the world.

### Price Limits Lifted, Market Still Deserted: New Prices Being Negotiated Everywhere; Food and Vegetable Prices Rise Several Times

Nanjing [Report from Our Office, 1st] After the Executive Yuan passed the supplementary measures for economic control on the 31st, the reaction of the Nanjing market on the 1st seemed still very sluggish. As the shops did not receive instructions from the government, they still stopped doing business all day on the 1st, the same as the previous day. The Wuyang Market was the same. Only the small vegetable market was slightly different. Eggs, which were not seen in the past, were already on the market, selling for 3 jiao each, six times higher than the price limit. However, pork was still in short supply. It is generally believed that the market will not return to its old state until two or three days later.

Wuxi [Report from Our Office, 1st] Although various industries opened as usual on the morning of the 1st, there was even more intense panic buying, especially among young people from other provinces who rushed to buy rubber products. Although the military and police were dispatched to maintain order, it was not effective. At 3 pm, the County Chamber of Commerce convened a temporary meeting. Various industries reported the suffering of being panic bought, requesting relief. It was decided to suspend business for two days from the 2nd to sort out the inventory. Industries discussing price negotiations included oil, cotton yarn, cloth, kerosene, southern goods, candy, paint, cigarettes, department stores, flour, etc. The sale of rice and grain at fixed prices was also temporarily suspended. It was scheduled to be sold universally after the prices were negotiated on the 3rd. It is said that the market price has increased by about two times.

Suzhou [Report from Our Office, 1st] After learning that the price limit was lifted and free trading was restored in this county, the county government convened an emergency meeting of grain merchants and heads of various agencies on the morning of the 1st. As a result of the discussion, the purchase of flour was stopped, and the supply of rice, oil, etc. to the market was immediately restored. However, the market side suspended transactions due to insufficient sources.

Changshu [Report from Our Office, 1st] After the announcement of the supplementary measures for economic control, the business community here was quite interested. On the 1st, the market prices of various goods rose sharply. The county authorities convened an emergency meeting to discuss and resolve various technical issues of price negotiation. It was decided that the prices of yarn, cloth, sugar, coal, and salt should be determined by the central competent authorities, while the prices of other important daily necessities should be negotiated by the industries themselves and reported to the county for approval. From the 2nd, various industries will resume normal business. If there are any special accidents, the county will take measures to prevent them. All checkpoints will be abolished.

Jiangyin [Report from Our Office, 1st] With the announcement of the supplementary measures for economic control, the market situation in Cheng County is stable. How to proceed will depend on the situation in Wuxi. The shops in various industries have been emptied due to the panic buying in October, and are virtually closed down. They are unable to pay business tax. On the 1st, the County Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Department of Finance, requesting exemption to alleviate the business difficulties.

Nantong [Report from Our Office, 1st] The supplementary plan for financial and economic reform was disclosed in the newspapers today, and the market is even more chaotic. The panic buying of silk fabrics and Wuyang goods is extremely crowded. Fortunately, the distribution of rice has been distributed, and the order is still good.

Yangzhou [Report from Our Office, 1st] The County Material Adjustment Committee was formally established on the 31st. County Magistrate Wang concurrently serves as the chairman, and the vice-chairmen are appointed by the Speaker of the Senate and the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

Zhenjiang [Report from Our Office, 1st] After the price limit was lifted, the Provincial Capital convened a temporary meeting on the afternoon of the 1st at the Chamber of Commerce to adjust prices and stabilize social order. It was decided that the prices of major daily necessities would be reviewed by the Department of Social Affairs on the 2nd, and sent to the Provincial Price Review Committee through the county for approval and implementation.

Hangzhou [Report from Our Office, 1st] After receiving the supplementary measures for economic control from the Zhejiang Provincial Government, it convened an emergency meeting on the 1st and decided that various counties and cities would implement price negotiations for various daily necessities and send urgent telegrams to the entire province for implementation. (Another Telegram) The 1st is the Merchant's Day, and most shops in Hangzhou are closed. After the price limit was lifted, only cigarettes fell slightly. The City Chamber of Commerce convened a temporary meeting to discuss how to determine prices after the price limit was lifted, to support government laws and regulations, and to persuade various industries not to take the opportunity to raise prices wildly and stimulate public sentiment. The grain market is scheduled to formally resume trading on the 2nd. The new prices are set at 86 yuan for high-grade, 82 yuan for medium-grade, and 78 yuan for low-grade.

Wuhu [Report from Our Office, 1st] Today, the shelves of silk fabric, department store, and Wuyang stores in Wuhu are still empty. Rice has been supplied, at 40 yuan per stone. Due to someone preventing purchases outside the suburbs, firewood and charcoal are still out of stock. The vegetable market has fish and meat, which are one to two times higher than the original price limit.

Bengbu [Report from Our Office, 1st] The grain market is already free to trade, but the grain source is still scarce due to the continuous purchase by scalpers along the river. Rice is even more difficult to obtain, and briquettes are also being snapped up.

Nanchang [Report from Our Office, 1st] From the 2nd, Nanchang prices will be decontrolled in accordance with the supplementary measures for economic reform of the Executive Yuan. Yesterday was the last day for exchanging gold, silver, and foreign currencies. The Central Bank only exchanged one silver dollar.

Guangzhou [Report from Our Office, 1st] The exchange of gold, silver, and foreign currencies here ended as scheduled on the 31st. However, there were very few people going to exchange on that day, and only one US dollar, 89 Hong Kong dollars, 65 silver dollars, and 10 Philippine pesos were exchanged. Market prices and black market foreign currencies rose madly, with a general increase of more than 30% in one day. The market turmoil is similar to that before the issuance of the Gold Yuan.

Hankou [Report from Our Office, 1st] After the price limit policy was changed, the market here did not show significant fluctuations in other prices except for the sharp rise in the price of discs used to make cigarettes.

Tianjin [Report from Central News Agency, 1st] After the announcement of the supplementary measures for financial and economic reform, the Tianjin market is looking forward to it. However, there is a big difference in psychology between the two sides, so transactions are quite sluggish. Grain prices have not changed much, and yarn, cloth, and groceries are firmer. Regarding the issue of setting prices for daily necessities by the local government, Hu Menghua, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, said: Based on past experience, it can be said with certainty that the stricter the control, the more unstable the situation. Especially under the current situation where the government cannot thoroughly control production and distribution, setting the price too low will inevitably lead to the disruption of material flow. Therefore, Tianjin's price-setting policy must be lenient in the future, and the economic situation may be slightly stabilized.

Qingdao [Report from Central News Agency, 1st] After the announcement of the supplementary measures for financial and economic reform, the Qingdao market has responded well. All brands of cloth and yarn have slightly rebounded, and the food market is active.

### Huang Chao-chin Talks About Adjusting the Taiwan Exchange Rate: Predicts Taiwan Prices Will Plunge; Taiwan Bank's Suspension of Receiving Remittances from Outside the Province Is Still Thoroughly Implemented

[Report from Our Taipei Office, 1st] All sectors here are pleased with the adjustment of the Taiwan exchange rate. According to Huang Chao-chin, Speaker of the Provincial Senate: Taiwan's economic system is different from the mainland, and it has a huge production force. If it can be stabilized, this production force can be exerted to its maximum efficiency. Adjusting the Taiwan exchange rate to make it mobile is an important factor in stabilizing Taiwan. In the future, increased production will contribute to the country. He believes that the increase or decrease of the combined exchange rate is not enough to affect the value of the Gold Yuan. The general Taiwan compatriots feel the same way. If sacrificing Taiwan can protect the country, the Taiwan compatriots will be happy to sacrifice. However, if sacrificing Taiwan does not help the overall plan, it is better to preserve Taiwan. Huang also predicted that Taiwan prices will plunge in the shortest possible time.

[Report from Our Taipei Office, 1st] Qu Jingzhou, Deputy General Manager of the Bank of Taiwan, told reporters on the 1st: After the Taiwan exchange rate is adjusted, the previously established method of suspending the receipt of remittances from outside the province will still be thoroughly implemented. He explained the lack of cash on the market, saying: The current total amount of issuance is 64 billion yuan, and deposits are more than 30 billion yuan, which is only 10 million US dollars at the market price, which is only one-twentieth of the total amount of circulating funds during the Japanese occupation. The current population has increased and the business has expanded, which requires more than the Japanese occupation period. I feel that the chips are too thin, which proves that the combined currency will never inflate.

### Mobile Capital Along the Bengbu-Xuzhou Line Flows into Northern Anhui to Purchase Grain

### US Holds General Election Today, Dewey Likely to Ascend to the Presidential Throne, Truman Still Has Great Confidence, Both Parties' Presidential and Vice-Presidential Candidates Urge People to Vote

[United Press International, Washington, 1st] Political polls unanimously indicate today that American voters will elect the first Republican president in twenty years tomorrow. Polling places will open at sunrise, and it is expected that between 47 and 50 million people will vote. However, it is feared that half of the eligible voters nationwide will forgo their right this time. It seems that the Republican Party will retain its majority in the House of Representatives, but the number of seats may be slightly reduced. As for the Senate, the outcome is still uncertain. The Republican advantage is questionable, and the Democratic Party has a chance to split the seats evenly with the Republican Party, each occupying 48 seats, or even surpassing them. Currently, the Republican Party has 51 seats, and the Democratic Party has 45 seats. Republican presidential and vice-presidential candidates Dewey and Warren will address the nation tonight on major broadcasting networks. Shortly thereafter, Democratic presidential and vice-presidential candidates Truman and Barkley will follow with their broadcasts. Traditionally, the last speech of each presidential candidate is not intended for campaigning but rather to urge voters to vote. Although this year will inevitably follow this precedent, this election campaign is one of the most fierce in modern history. In addition to electing a president tomorrow, 432 members of the House of Representatives, 32 senators, 32 governors, and tens of thousands of local officials will also be elected. Truman has returned to his hometown of Independence, Missouri, and will await the announcement of the election results there. Dewey has returned to his country residence in New York State and will enter the Republican headquarters in New York City in the afternoon to await good news.

[United Press International, New York, 31st] The presidential candidates will deliver optimistic final speeches tonight, ending the 1948 presidential campaign. New York Governor Dewey appears to have a strong grasp on victory. President Truman still hopes to win a large number of votes and overturn general expectations.

[Agence France-Presse, St. Louis, 30th] Missouri political circles believe that since the beginning of the campaign, Truman's chances of being elected seem to have increased, but to defeat Dewey, a miracle would have to occur. Observers speculate that although Truman has tried his best to win the votes of 60 million workers, most workers will still vote for Dewey. Observers here stated: Truman will likely win in Missouri.

[United Press International, Washington, 1st] According to weather forecasts, the weather will be clear in most parts of the country on the 2nd, when the national election is held. A Democratic spokesman immediately stated: He firmly believes that clear weather will enable Truman to win more than 60 million votes and be elected to the White House. The Republican Party remains optimistic about its chances of winning.

### General Procedures for US Elections, the People First Elect Electors, Then the President, Congressmen, and Governors are Produced

[United States Information Service, Washington, 1st] The US Electoral College does not directly vote to elect the president from among the candidates. In reality, people vote to elect "electors," who then elect the president from among the candidates in an electoral meeting. There are a total of 531 electoral votes, and a winning presidential candidate must obtain at least 266 of them. If any candidate fails to obtain the necessary number of votes, the election may be deadlocked. If this is the case, the president will be elected by the US House of Representatives.

This year, the Electoral College will not only elect the president and vice president but also 32 of the 96 members of the US Senate, 432 of the 435 members of the US House of Representatives, 32 of the 48 governors, and many state and city officials. Nationally, besides the presidential contest, the competition between the Democratic and Republican parties to control the Senate is attracting increasing attention. The Republican Party is currently the majority party. If one party can control either house of Congress, the chairman of that house and most of the seats and leading figures on the committees will belong to that party. If men and women citizens of the United States who have reached voting age still do not know the appearance, views, and public and private lives of the candidates, it is not the fault of the candidates or the US news media.

### Dewey Attends Church, Young Pastor Feels Nervous

[Central News Agency, New York, 31st, United Press] Dewey rested in his home in his hometown today and prayed to spend his weekend before the election peacefully. This morning, Dewey drove with his wife to Trinity Episcopal Church to attend service. Mrs. Dewey wore a red hat and a silver fox stole. The church can only accommodate 100 people, and there were 58 people attending the service this morning (including ten reporters covering the election news). The Deweys sat in the third row. The young pastor Wimmsley, who presided over the service, trembled when he read the prayers. The Deweys repeatedly knelt on the cushions to pray. After quietly listening to Pastor Wimmsley's sermon, the Deweys drove home. Mr. Dewey rested in the afternoon, temporarily putting the election aside.

### Moscow Newspaper Comments on US Elections

No Difference Between the Democratic and Republican Parties

[United Press International, Moscow, 1st] Moscow newspapers unanimously believe that it makes little difference whether the Democratic or Republican Party wins the US presidential election on the 2nd. They believe that the competition between the Democratic and Republican parties is merely a competition between two parties controlled by highly financial groups and led by undemocratic leaders. They claim that when Truman and Dewey compete for the presidency, terrorist organizations will try to prevent millions of progressive citizens from going to vote.

### Japanese Hope Dewey Will Be Elected to Actively Help Japan Recover

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st, United Press] Japanese political and economic figures believe that after Dewey is elected, the Republican government will be more active than the Truman government in helping Japan complete its economic recovery. According to people close to the Yoshida cabinet, Yoshida believes that the Dewey government will be more supportive of adopting more conservative policies to guide Japan's economic reconstruction than some New Deal figures in the Allied General Headquarters. Japanese figures have noted the possibility that the Dewey government may help revise the Allied policy of dispersing Japanese industries, thereby accelerating Japan's economic recovery. Japanese newspapers have given great importance to the US election, publishing various reports before the election with prominent coverage.

### US Republican Diplomats Explore Concluding a Separate Peace Treaty with Japan, Future Policy Will Depend on the Evolution of the Situation in Asia

[Central News Agency, New York, 31st, United Press] Republican diplomatic experts are currently exploring the possibility of concluding a peace treaty with Japan, either with or without the Soviet Union. They emphasize that they are in the initial stages of research, and the final decision may be months away. At a time when Dewey has made repeated declarations in his campaign speeches but is unwilling to issue any clear policy statements, some senior Republican advisors expect that if the government does change as they expect, then peace with Japan will be made next year. Those who favor concluding a peace treaty with Japan regardless of whether the Soviet Union participates point out that the United States concluded a separate peace with Germany after World War I and refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles. These people believe that the United States expects Britain, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and France to also sign a peace treaty. There is some doubt as to whether China is still bound by the 1945 treaty with the Soviet Union that prohibits "separate peace." Senior Republicans have made it clear that the United States cannot take clear action in the Far East without studying the secret reports currently only available to the Democratic administration. They say that the two parties' foreign policy depends on obtaining supplementary secret intelligence and the future evolution of the overall situation in Asia.

### October Revolution Anniversary, Soviet Slogans Emphasize Increased Production

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 1st] The slogans of the Soviet Communist Party commemorating the 31st anniversary of its October Revolution have been published in today's newspapers. Compared with the content of previous slogans, the focus remains on the production sector, with a total of 52 slogans. Forty-three of the slogans are designed to address this theme, namely, requiring people to strengthen efficiency, strengthen efforts to increase production, which is sufficient to indicate that while people around the world are feeling bewildered about the overall situation, the Soviet Union is still continuing its production movement. Only three slogans relate to world issues, namely, demanding that workers expose the ideas of warmongers and unite democratic forces in the struggle for peace and security.

### Opposition to Anglo-Chinese Proposal on Holy Land, Soviet Union to Use Veto, Egypt Says Jewish Forces in Negev Have Not Ceased Fire

[United Press International, Paris, 31st] The Security Council will hold another meeting on the Palestine issue next week. Well-informed observers expect the Soviet Union to exercise its veto if necessary to reject the proposal put forward by China and Britain, which would require Jewish forces to withdraw from the areas they occupied during the war, or face consideration of economic and diplomatic sanctions. The Security Council is expected to meet on the 3rd to vote on this proposal, which was passed by a subcommittee of the Security Council on the 30th.

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 31st] Tonight, Egyptian Prime Minister Nuqrashi declared that the news circulating this morning that a ceasefire had been reached in Palestine was not credible, and that the fighting there was still intense. The Jews do not seem to be complying with the United Nations' order for a ceasefire in the area.

[Agence France-Presse, al-'Arish, 31st] It is reported that Egyptian forces in the Negev continue to retreat from important strongholds, and the Egyptian pocket is now shrinking again.

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 31st] According to the semi-official newspaper *Attalat*, Soviet troops penetrated into the Moghan region in the northwest of Azerbaijan Province and fired on an Iranian patrol, killing one and injuring several.

The Soviet military action is a violation of international law, which causes cloud to Soviet-Iranian relations. It is hoped that the Soviet government will take appropriate measures to avoid such unfortunate events.

[Agence France-Presse, Tehran, 31st] Former Iranian Prime Minister, current Member of Parliament Mohammad, told reporters today that Iran's most important concern is not to be involved in the struggles of major power blocs. Iran and the Soviet Union share a tangled border, requiring mutual friendship and the development of commercial relations.

### Political Crisis in Greece Temporarily Eases, Unlikely to Erupt Within Two Weeks

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 31st] Former Liberal Party Prime Minister Venizelos stated that the political crisis that threatened yesterday seems to have been postponed by one or two weeks.

### Citywide Meeting of All Industries, Mayor and Speaker Deliver Earnest Admonitions, Price Adjustments Must Be Reasonable, Do Not Fail the Government's Hard Work, Two Provisional Motions Passed, Request Release of Arrested Merchants, Approve Import of Industrial Necessities with Own Foreign Exchange

[Our Report] In order to discuss the issue of commodity prices in the city after the lifting of price controls, the Shanghai Industrial Association and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of members of all industries at the auditorium of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at 5:00 PM yesterday. Attending were Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Director Wu, Luo Qinghua, Du Yuesheng, Xu Xueyu, and the chairmen of various trade associations, totaling more than 400 people. The meeting was presided over by Chairman Xu Jilong and lasted for two hours before adjourning. Two provisional motions were passed during the meeting: (1) To send a telegram to all chambers of commerce nationwide, requesting the Central Government to release legitimate merchants who were detained under the Emergency Financial Measures Ordinance. (2) To request the Central Government to allow the import of industrial necessities with their own foreign exchange.

After Chairman Xu Jilong delivered a brief opening speech, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, stating in brief: Since the Central Government announced the lifting of price controls, the local government and the Bureau of Social Affairs had to engage in thorough discussions with the industrial and commercial sectors regarding future price issues. I believe that everyone should have a common understanding of the government at present. Over the past seventy-odd days, the government has repeatedly changed its economic policies, and its motives have all been to rescue the people. In order to quell the rebellion, inflation is inevitably unavoidable. When hyperinflation began in July and August of this year, causing the people to be unable to live and the industrial and commercial sectors to face severe difficulties, the government, in view of this, made the decision to reform the currency system and implement price controls. However, after price controls were implemented, factories were unable to resume production, materials were hoarded, and people's lives became even more difficult. Therefore, the government had no choice but to announce the lifting of price controls. Of course, economic problems should be solved with economic methods, and lifting price controls is still a way to solve them. However, what I worry about is that the past phenomenon was "money without goods," and in the future, it is feared that it will be "goods without money." Before today, everyone was deeply afraid of not having enough to eat or wear. After today, five million citizens are worried that prices will soar. In today's situation, I hope that the industrial and commercial sectors can act conscientiously and adjust commodity prices reasonably, without seeking exorbitant profits. I hope that all trade associations can strengthen their organizations and help the government overcome this difficult situation. I sincerely pray that the industrial and commercial sectors of Shanghai will take the lead in abiding by the law and become a model for the country.

### Considering the People's Purchasing Power

Following the speech by Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau, which briefly stated: The government's decision to lift price controls this time is purely to rescue the crisis of industry and commerce, because today industry and commerce have reached a critical juncture of survival. The most urgent and important issue at present is how to adjust the prices of finished products. I hope that all industries can consider one issue when determining prices—the purchasing power of the people. After several changes in Shanghai, the purchasing power of the citizens has indeed generally declined. Today, it has truly reached the point where the people are impoverished and their wealth is exhausted. You should also consider how to enable the poor to continue to live, because this is a factor in Shanghai's stability. The pricing of various industries must be reasonable. Those with high costs should have higher prices, but those whose raw materials are allocated by the government have very low costs, and the pricing should be reduced accordingly. Moreover, various industries have suffered losses in this buying spree, but to varying degrees. Taking the cotton cloth industry as an example, cloth shops were completely emptied by the buying spree and suffered heavy losses, but the losses of the factories were lighter, and the losses of wholesalers were even lighter. Furthermore, the losses of the woolen yarn industry were even slighter. Therefore, when determining new prices, various industries should consider the actual cost needs and strive for fairness and reasonableness.

### It is Essential to Be Reasonable and Not Arouse Citizen Resentment

Following the speech by Speaker Pan, he stated: The so-called extraordinary period is not a period in which ordinary principles can be applied. After the announcement of the August 19th price control policy, I immediately went to Nanjing to present the matter to the President and Minister Wang, requesting the central government to trust the people. Any policy must succeed with the cooperation of the people. I hoped that the government would trust and utilize the chambers of commerce, but unfortunately, it was not adopted at the time. Now, it is no longer a matter of reviewing and settling past responsibilities. The current focus should be on how to control prices in the future. From today onwards, it will depend on the chambers of commerce and trade associations themselves. Because in the past, we had reasons to shirk responsibility, but now that the government has trusted us, if we still fail, then we will suffer the consequences and deserve to die. If the trade associations do not exercise their conscience at this time and seek exorbitant profits, then in another month, the people will forget the suffering of price controls and complain about the soaring prices. Therefore, we must not let down the government's good intentions. When determining prices, all industries should use the lowest actual cost as the standard. If the government has allocated yarn, the cost will be very low. Moreover, the prices of public utilities have not changed in the past two months, which is enough to lower the prices of finished products. Therefore, the first round of pricing must be reasonable so as not to arouse citizen resentment. In short, all colleagues in the industrial and commercial sectors should recognize one point: if the communists arrive, Shanghai will become a Soviet military base. Do we want to be a vassal of the Soviet Union, or do we want to fight for democracy? I sincerely hope that all industrial and commercial enterprises will do their part to assist the democratic government in resisting the communist rebellion.

### First Negotiate a Provisional Price

Following the speech by Luo Qinghua, which briefly stated that the current economic track is in disarray, and cost accounting is difficult, but we must follow the instructions of the municipal authorities, and all industries should first negotiate a provisional price so that there will be goods on the market tomorrow. A reasonable price should be further negotiated in the long term.

### Various Industries Raise Opinions

At this point, Yang Fusheng of the Shoe and Hat Trade Association, Liu Qingyi of the Silk Weaving Trade Association, Liu Yihe of the Tobacco Exchange Trade Association, and Li Bojia of the Book Trade Association, among others, raised opinions. Director Wu gave a comprehensive response, stating: The scope of pricing is limited to daily necessities, including not many items, which will be announced within a day or two. Items that are not daily necessities are not subject to control and can be priced by the trade associations according to production costs and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval.

Finally, Mr. Du Yuesheng advised all industries to be calm and support the government and assist the government to overcome difficulties together. The meeting adjourned at 7 o'clock.

### Meeting Scheduled Today to Discuss Wage Adjustment Issues

[Our Reporter] Regarding the wage issue after the lifting of price controls, the supplementary measures stipulate that it should be determined by the local competent authorities with reference to the needs of maintaining workers' livelihoods. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a meeting at 3 pm today at the bureau, inviting Vice Minister Lu Jingshi of the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Industry, representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Industrial Association, the General Labor Union, and the Workers' Welfare Committee, including Wu Yun Chu, Pan Shihao, Wang Zhuyi, Yao Shushen, Shui Xianyun, Shu Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, and Zhang Zhusan, to discuss the matter together. Director Wu stated that he already has a draft in mind and will make a decision after collecting opinions from all parties. Whether to adopt a pay scale based on the cost of living index has not yet been decided.

### Supply Bureau Continues to Allocate Materials for Sale Today to Regulate the Market

### Jiang Jingguo Expresses Apologies and Issues a Letter to the Citizens

[Our Reporter] Jiang Jingguo issued a letter to the citizens yesterday, the full text of which is as follows: "In the 70 days of work, I deeply feel that I have not fulfilled my due responsibilities. Not only have I failed to complete the plan and tasks, but in some places, I have aggravated the suffering of the citizens of Shanghai in the work process. I am determined not to push the responsibility that I should bear onto anyone, and I am also determined not to abandon my political views due to setbacks. I firmly believe that the path of 'Where Shanghai is Going' that I have pointed out is absolutely correct. Today, in addition to requesting punishment from the government to clarify responsibility, I express my deepest apologies to the citizens of Shanghai. Here, I am not trying to seek the forgiveness of the citizens, but to express my sense of responsibility to the citizens. I earnestly hope that the citizens of Shanghai will use their own strength to prevent speculators, profiteers, bureaucratic politicians, and local ruffians from controlling Shanghai again. I always believe that the future of Shanghai must be bright."

### Several Proposals from the Authorities in Charge: Goods Made from Price-Controlled Raw Materials Should Be Purchased and Distributed to Citizens; Legitimate Merchants Who Suffer Losses Should Also Be Compensated

[Our Reporter] After the lifting of price controls, the person in charge of the Economic Control Office formally received reporters in the Central Bank conference room yesterday afternoon, emphasizing that although price controls have been lifted, the government should still not allow profiteers to take the opportunity to make a fortune. The prices of goods will be completely new from tomorrow onwards, but many goods were hoarded before August 19 or manufactured after the implementation of controls with allocated price-controlled raw materials and price-controlled wages. Especially for yarn and silk, both the Textile Corporation and the China Development Finance Corporation have allocated sales. Merchants should not make exorbitant profits by opening up the price controls. Therefore, it has been requested the Municipal Government to purchase these goods and distribute them to citizens at the price-controlled price to show fairness. Furthermore, ordinary legitimate merchants who operate on a small scale, such as cotton cloth stores and southern goods stores, did sell all their goods at the price-controlled price, causing them to suffer huge losses today. I hope that the Municipal Government can allocate some of the purchased goods to these stores, otherwise, it would be too unfair for those who are law-abiding to suffer.

Full Force Investigation of Undeclared Gold Certificates

After the deadline for the exchange of gold certificates, the Inspection Committee will devote all its efforts to investigating undeclared gold certificates. Those who are found will be confiscated. I feel very sorry for the citizens who have suffered significant losses today from exchanging gold certificates. If we do not strengthen the inspection of undeclared gold certificates in the future, I will be even more ashamed. In order to effectively complete the task, we are currently studying a non-disruptive method of informing.

Strengthening of the Rationing System is Desired

In the future, control work will be transferred to local governments. I believe that the rationing system is the most effective way to stabilize prices and calm people's hearts. I hope that the Municipal Government can strengthen its handling. The Economic Control Office can still be responsible for supplying oil, sugar, and coal for November and December. Furthermore, the three committees under the Economic Control Office will continue to exist in the future. The work of the Inspection Committee will focus on investigating undeclared gold certificates. The illegal goods confiscated by the Economic Control Office in the past will be transferred to the Central Bank for future refugee relief.

When asked about the issue of advancement and retreat, I did not give a definite answer, only saying, "I will do my duty for one day in office."

### Economic Control Inspection Committee's Focus of Work: Inspecting Gold Certificates and Cracking Down on National Accumulation

The Shanghai District Inspection Committee of the Executive Yuan Economic Control Committee held a meeting at the National Bank yesterday.

It was also resolved that the focus of future work will be divided into (1) strengthening the inspection of gold certificates, and (2) cracking down on profiteers' hoarding. Finally, a method of rewarding informants for reporting the possession of gold certificates was also adopted.

Yesterday, most shops in this city suspended business in the name of waiting for price negotiation. Various trade associations held meetings to discuss the matter, and some associations sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to request adjustment of prices. The Social Affairs Bureau decided yesterday that the items to be negotiated are soybean oil, wool, woolen yarn, kerosene, coal balls, cigarettes, matches, and soap. The industrial raw materials will be decided after consulting with the Municipal Industrial Association. The Social Affairs Bureau has instructed the relevant trade associations to report production costs, which will be reviewed and decided by the Shanghai Municipal Price Negotiation Committee.

### The Bottom of Xibao Xing Road Died; The Deceased Was Shot Several Times; The Criminals Were All Dressed in Military Uniforms; The Driver of the Xinsheng Automobile Company Is the Only Witness

[Our Reporter] A dead man who had been shot, his body riddled with bullets, was found at about 5 pm on the 30th of last month at the bottom of Xibao Xing Road, at the junction of Yuexiu Road and the Lianyishan Zhuang (i.e., the Lin Family Garden), near the steps in the eastern grassy area. Zhang Xinkang, an official of the Zhuang, reported the incident to the Dachang Police Sub-Bureau, and Director Zhang ordered Criminal Section Chief He Peiji to lead officers Liu Zichang to the scene for investigation. The deceased was wearing a brand new tweed western-style jacket, gray striped suit, white shirt, black tie with white dots, silk short socks, and yellow leather shoes, with his head to the west and feet to the east. On the grass where the corpse was located, two bright Ma brand pistol bullets were found, and two bullet holes were found in the lower left part of the coat, one bullet hole in the left trouser leg, and one hole in the chest. A bullet was also dug out of the soil. A Beijing identity card was found next to the deceased's body.

The card read Huang Yanan

Thirty-one years old, from Beijing. A wallet was found with a check from Qichang Qianzhuang for 720 gold yuan, and 135.3 gold yuan. A note was found with the location and contact information of Zhang Wenqi, a member of the 4th Squadron of the Air Force. The Photography Section of the General Bureau was immediately telegraphed to send personnel to take photos in the countryside, and then the body was transported by car to the autopsy office on Changde Road to wait for examination. At that time, a business trip car with license plate number 03.3147, owned by Xinsheng Military Motor Company at 168 Wusong Road, was found parked at the gate of the Zhuang. Driver Cui Changjun was summoned to the bureau for interrogation. According to the confession, at about 1 pm on the same day, two men dressed as soldiers, speaking Chongqing dialect, came to the company to rent a car, stating

Round trip to Jiangwan

The car fee was 20 gold yuan. The accountant ordered him to drive the car on a business trip. After the two soldiers got into the car, they ordered him to drive towards Yuexiu Road. When they reached the middle section of the road, one of the soldiers, who was taller, ordered him to stop and get out of the car. The other soldier instructed the car to turn around and return to Shanghai. He drove to the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road to buy cigarettes without success. He drove to the cigarette stand at the Carlton Theatre to buy cigarettes, and then got out of the car across the road from the New World. After waiting for about 40 minutes, he came with a man in a suit (i.e., the deceased) and took the same car to a small alley at Yingshi Road and Fuxing Road. He ordered him to accompany them. After the two got out of the car, they came out after 15 minutes and went to the middle section of Yuexiu Road. One of the taller soldiers

Was already waiting there

After greeting, he re-entered the car and ordered him to go straight to Lianyishan Zhuang, saying he was going for a walk. While in the car, he vaguely heard the deceased say that he had booked 30 wedding banquets in Ping. The car was too noisy to hear anything else. According to eyewitnesses, a soldier crossed the wire fence behind the Zhuang and escaped across the stream. According to speculation, the cause of the case was a love affair. The sub-bureau is now sending detectives to hunt down the criminals for investigation.

### Rice Market Resumes Trading - Nanshi White Keng Reaches a High of Eighty Yuan

[Report from this newspaper] After the authorities resumed free trade in the food market, new prices were quoted yesterday in both the North and South Rice Markets in the city. In the Nanshi Market, Wujiang rice was traded at 80 yuan per dan (a unit of dry measure), and ordinary paddy rice at 73 yuan. In the Beishi Market, injured and broken direct rice was traded at 78 yuan. Over 2,000 dan of rice arrived at both markets yesterday, but there was no significant increase. The total transaction volume was approximately 500 dan.

Another report: After the announcement of the new economic supplementary measures yesterday morning, which stipulated free trade in rice, the people of all parties expressed relief and satisfaction, and the amount of grain transported to Shanghai from various places continued to increase. In the Nanshi Market, thin paddy rice opened at 80 yuan and early rice at 73 yuan, but the transaction volume was not high. Rice merchants transported 718 shi (a unit of dry measure) on their own, and distributors handled 87 shi and 2.5 dou (a unit of dry measure) on their own. In the Beishi Market, second-grade white keng rice opened at 78 yuan, but there were no other transactions. Rice merchants transported 213 shi on their own, rice stores handled 277 shi on their own, non-grain merchants purchased 335 shi on their own, and rice mills transported 740 shi on their own. The total for both markets was 1924 shi and 2.5 dou.

Another report: In the miscellaneous grains market yesterday, due to the authorities lifting price controls and resuming free trade, traders automatically negotiated prices. Hankou green beans were quoted at 37 yuan, cowpeas at 40 yuan, corn at 61 yuan, red sorghum at 40 yuan, late beans at 40 yuan, winter beans at 45 yuan, and Xuzhou soybeans at 45 yuan, but these were not transaction prices. The edible oil and flour markets were still in a state of suspension due to the failure to obtain reasonable price adjustments.

### Foreign Exchange Policy Remains Unchanged for Now

The foreign exchange policy is of great concern to all parties after the implementation of the economic supplementary measures. According to inquiries from a reporter of the United Credit Bureau to relevant parties, the government has no intention of changing the foreign exchange policy at present. A responsible person also solemnly denied rumors of an adjustment. However, judging from the current situation, after the lifting of price controls, there is a significant difference between domestic and foreign prices of goods. If this exchange rate is maintained, exports of goods may fall into a state of desperation.

According to well-informed sources, the government is being extremely cautious on this issue and will not act rashly. Once prices have stabilized somewhat, it will consider raising the exchange rate to ensure a continuous flow of exports.

### Increased Value of the Taiwan Dollar Hinders the Flow of Floating Capital to Taiwan

The government's decision to increase the ratio of the Taiwan dollar to the Gold Yuan to 1000:1 will effectively hinder the surge of floating capital flowing to Taiwan Province. It is reported that since "August 19th," more than 30 million Gold Yuan has flowed into Taiwan Province, putting great pressure on prices in Taiwan Province. Currently, although remittances from Shanghai to Taiwan have been temporarily suspended, the amount of cash that travelers can carry is also strictly limited (travelers are allowed to carry a maximum of 1,000 Gold Yuan, with proof from the chairman of the trade association; merchants can carry 20 yuan to purchase goods, and public officials of state-owned provincial enterprises can carry 5,000 yuan), but the flow of funds to Taiwan still exceeds 50,000 Gold Yuan per day, while remittances from Taiwan to Shanghai are almost non-existent. This phenomenon was not seen before "August 19th," when remittances from Taiwan to Shanghai were far more frequent than remittances from Shanghai to Taiwan.

### Regulations for Issuing Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates Stipulate a Set of Four Copies

The National Bank's Business Bureau recently issued Circular No. 159 to all designated banks, stating: "Regarding the procedures for designated banks to issue Export Settlement Certificates CBC86, this bank has already stipulated and implemented them in Circular No. 157. This circular is hereby issued again for your reference and attention. Please ensure that only a set of four copies is issued in accordance with the regulations. If the export is re-exported through Hong Kong or Macau, only one additional special copy may be added."

### Deadline for Gold and Foreign Currency Redemption - Communication Reports to be Judged by Postmark

October 31st was the last day of the deadline for redeeming gold and foreign currencies. The National Bank's Shanghai branch redeemed a total of 18.085 taels of gold, 27.06 taels of silver, 116.5 yuan in silver dollars, 408 silver dimes, US$225.35, HK$14.60, and 11.06 Philippine pesos that day. After the deadline for redeeming gold and foreign currencies, communication reports from other locations and rural mobile redemptions will also end simultaneously. Correspondence reports from other locations submitted before the deadline (October 31st) will be processed based on the postmark.

### Silk Industry Market Plans to Request Permission to Resume Operations

[Report from this newspaper] There is a strong desire among silk merchants to resume trading. However, due to the limited number of traders and the lack of domestic production of silk, traders have no way to purchase goods. Although the China Supplies Bureau is responsible for the overall allocation of raw materials needed by the silk weaving industry, the allocation is insufficient, and factories still feel that they cannot meet their needs. Now that the financial and economic supplementary measures have been announced, all equipment in the silk weaving industry is planned to be gradually put into operation, so the need for raw materials is even greater than before. Since the implementation of price controls, imports of raw silk have been virtually suspended, and the supply of silk fabrics to other locations has also decreased. After this opening, the demand from various places that have been thirsty for a long time will be greater than before August 19th. For the sake of universal supply, the industry plans to request permission from the relevant authorities to resume free market trading after the prices of various goods have been reviewed.

Since the implementation of economic controls, trading in the silk fabric market has been suspended after the Social Bureau notified that gatherings were to cease. Sales and trading by traders have been invisibly suspended. In the past, in order to implement the price control policy, the Silk Weaving Industry Association required each factory to hand over its products based on their total output. In addition to the raw materials allocated, the remaining products were distributed and sold to retailers by the association to meet the urgent needs of retail customers. Wholesalers have ceased operations under price controls. Now that price controls have been lifted on various items, and silk fabrics are not a major daily necessity, the relevant parties still plan to request permission from the authorities to resume market operations.

### Cotton Cloth Manufacturers Gather to Discuss Prices - The Lowest Price for Longtou Fine Cloth Outside the Market is 60 Yuan

Yesterday, cotton cloth trading did not resume because manufacturers were gathered to discuss prices and it was difficult to determine prices. Yesterday afternoon, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened various industries to discuss the matter, and the cloth stores decided to open for business today. In off-market cotton cloth trading, Longtou cloth was quoted starting from 60 yuan, with transactions reaching as high as 75 yuan, Four Gentlemen Serge was 80 yuan, and No. 190 high-end Shilin cloth was 140 yuan.

Another report: The China Textile Construction Company has also temporarily suspended rationing and will proceed after the central authorities have approved the prices. The various types of cloth produced by dyeing and weaving factories will also be priced after adjusting the costs.

Another report: After the announcement of the financial and economic supplementary plan, the cotton yarn market also plans to resume trading. However, after two months of closure, wholesalers' inventories have mostly been sold continuously, and current inventories are extremely low. According to a person in charge of the association, yarn merchants themselves cannot take the initiative in determining whether the market can be restored. In addition to the legal requirements, cotton yarn must be supplied by the factories. Today, because there are no regulations in the supplementary plan for the resumption of free trading of cotton yarn, the association will wait for the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to convene a meeting of various industries to discuss the matter before requesting the relevant authorities.

Another report: There has never been a market for cotton trading. In the past, cotton merchants and spinning mills traded and fellow traders bought and sold through brokers. However, since the price limit, the source has been cut off, there has been not much business, and traders have not sold their goods. Now that the financial and economic supplementary measures have been announced, the original plan to exchange yarn for cotton in the National Cotton Joint Purchase will also be changed. In order to maintain business survival, cotton merchants also plan to gradually resume trading after the Joint Purchase Association has approved the flower collection prices in various places.

### Tea Market Has Strong Buying Interest

Since the Executive Yuan's order to relax price controls and implement negotiated prices was transmitted to Shanghai, the supply of red and green tea varieties has been sluggish, affected by the depletion of stocks. Therefore, although the buying interest is still strong, it is difficult to get what one wants, and trading continues to be suspended. The market atmosphere is even more lively. Looking ahead, a brilliant future is expected.

### Sugar Trading Has Not Yet Started

The Sugar Market situation, yesterday, the association had no dynamics, because the sugar pricing category, subject to central approval, the market can not resume, needs to be quiet and look at the trends of various industries, people in the industry and more to seek the restoration of market transactions, but there has been no any discussion.

### Five Ocean Trading Still Stalled

The cigarette market attached to the Five Ocean Industry Association was temporarily suspended after being ordered a few days ago, the market trading stalled. Today, after the Executive Yuan's improved economic management supplementary measures were announced, although firewood, rice, oil and salt and other items have resumed free trading, the prices of daily necessities must be agreed upon by the association and submitted for approval. Before approval, trading is still in a state of suspension. The association is currently processing the procedures, and once approved, the association can resume trading.

The second batch has a total of two thousand boxes and will arrive tomorrow. Last week, the rayon of the 89th term, which the bureau should have distributed to the silk weaving industry, was suspended for some reason. It has been decided to resume rationing this week.

### Schools in Beiping and Tianjin Resume Classes - Back Pay and Flour Have Been Issued

[Nanjing, this newspaper, 1st] Schools in Beiping and Tianjin were forced to suspend classes because the prices of goods were rising daily, and flour for the staff and students for September and October had not been distributed as scheduled.

### Academic Snippets - Yingda University, Southeast Medical College

Yingda University: Yingda University started classes late this semester, on October 18. After a tiring four-month summer vacation, the students stepped into the classroom with a light step to listen to the class bell again.

When the books in the library were being snapped up, any readable book was borrowed within two days.

On the evening of October 26th, the anniversary of the school, the school authorities issued a meal allowance of three dimes per person. At the evening entertainment party, the Hansheng Peking Opera Troupe hung out a banner with the words "Long Live Yingda University" in the flickering lights, and the students cheered like thunder. When the curtain fell and the lights came on, the character "Sui" was written as the characters "Shan" and "Qi," so there was a burst of boos, and the party ended with laughter. (Jing)

Southeast Medical College: The new dormitory in the college has not been completed, so the temporary bedrooms are extremely crowded, like "sardines."

### Prelude to the US Election (8): A Prediction

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper

From the Communist Party's Twelve Gold Medals to Truman's Change of Guard

[Dispatch from New York, October 24th, from this newspaper] The only difference in this year's American election compared to previous ones is the wiping out of the American Communist Party. In the past, the chairman of the American Communist Party, Foster, was often included on the ballot for presidential candidates in New York State. Although very few people voted for Foster, in a liberal country, political parties freely competing in elections is a right that citizens should have under the guarantee of the constitution. However, this year's situation has changed. Since the international spy case was revealed, the American judicial authorities believe that the American Communist Party intends to overthrow the current government by violent means. Therefore, at the turn of summer and autumn, they arrested the twelve leading figures of the American Communist Party one after another, including the chairman of the Communist Party, heads of various departments, the mastermind of the women's movement, and even the instigators of the workers' movement in major cities. Some of them voluntarily surrendered to the "Federal Bureau of Investigation," while most were arrested by secret police.

Wallace's New Shop

Of course, the current situation is not as simple as it was in the past. The deterioration of US-Soviet relations is the main reason why the Communist Party lost its freedom of movement. In the United States, some people have requested the temporary release of Foster and his companions so that they can participate in the election on November 2nd, and after the election is over, the court can ask them to "return to the cage." This is a compromise that takes both theory and reality into account. However, after considering the results, the Supreme Court finally rejected this flexible compromise. The election ballot has already been determined not to include the names of Communist Party candidates, and in early November, before the general election, the Communist Party's "Twelve Gold Medals" will be formally tried publicly for "treason."

Because of these reasons, a large number of American "quasi-communists" and "semi-communists" have flocked to Wallace's newly opened shop. Wallace, out of "sympathy" for black people and Jews, simply moved into the homes of black people and Jews. In the past, Wallace also said: "If I were president, US-Soviet relations would not be so bad," and "If there are any difficulties, as long as I talk to Stalin, there will be a solution." Now he has simply accepted Stalin unconditionally. Wallace's current formula is: anything the Soviet Union does must be right, and any friction in US-Soviet relations must be the fault of the American rulers.

Marshall, the White Ant

After returning from a campaign trip to the Midwest, Wallace scolded Truman as a "big puppet." He said that since Truman fired the "New Economists" (i.e., the leftists of the Roosevelt era), Truman has actually abdicated. Presidential power has fallen into the hands of Wall Street tycoons and military officials, and Truman is nothing more than a figurehead. Wallace scolded Marshall, calling him a white ant. He said that Marshall's seizure of the State Department is like white ants occupying the beams of a hall. Over time, they will inevitably eat away the beams, causing the building to collapse. Wallace also said that Marshall hurriedly flew back from the Paris United Nations General Assembly, nominally to visit the president, but in reality, he did not talk to Truman for more than a few minutes. Marshall spent most of his time with Secretary of Defense Forrestal and large and small warlords, peddling war in large quantities.

After the "Vincent Affair"

Wallace also said that if Truman wants to be determined to save himself, the only way is to dismiss Marshall. In fact, since the so-called "Vincent Affair," Truman has naturally felt a bit disgusted with Marshall. Marshall, in Paris, felt that his boss was "sabotaging" him from behind, and he must have been full of complaints in Paris, just like Byrnes did the year before. After Marshall returned to Washington, Truman announced the cancellation of the idea of ​​"Vincent as an envoy to the Soviet Union," and the matter was generally considered to have come to an end. Unexpectedly, more than ten days later, this President, once again made a bold statement at Miami Beach: "In my opinion, sending Vincent to Moscow to negotiate directly with Stalin may not be the best way to seek peace"! Marshall, far away in Paris, must be so anxious that he would "hang himself" when he heard this!

Truman is Bound to Go

The disagreement between Truman and Marshall does not represent a contradiction in foreign policy, but represents the chaos and incompetence of the current US regime. After Truman fired two cannons in Miami, the editorial of New York's "Daily News," which has the largest circulation, wrote: "Mr. Truman, we ask you, we ask you not to make random comments anymore. Although you are useless and incompetent, you are still the president of a world-leading country... Don't say those stupid things from a Missouri hick anymore, and always remember that you are the president of the richest and most powerful country"!

Truman is bound to go, and there is probably no question about it. A campaign prediction expert from the New York Times estimated that out of the 531 "electoral units" in all 48 states (i.e., the votes of the "presidential electors"), the Republican Dewey may get 334 votes. Regardless of whether this prediction is accurate, the Democratic Party's sixteen years in the White House will obviously be the time for a "change of guard" this time! (End of full text)

### The Silk Industry in Wuxing is Declining: Attention Should be Paid to Two Major Root Causes

[Dispatch from Hangzhou, October 28th, from this newspaper] After arriving in Wuxing, the reporter investigated the local silk industry, and the details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Regarding the question of why the silk industry in Wuxing is so depressed, people in the area have put forward many reasons, but in the final analysis, it is nothing more than two major root causes: dyeing and conservatism. Because Wuxing's dyeing is not sophisticated, all colored silk will change color, so everyone does not come to inquire about it. However, if they all transported colored silk from Shanghai to make it like Dachang, it can be said that they do not have such hot capital. The silk factories in Shanghai have seen through Wuxing's hidden places, so they make colored silk themselves, which is much more convenient than transporting colored silk to Wuxing for weaving. In fact, dyeing is not sophisticated is also a kind of conservatism. If we specially recruit experts to study dyeing, there is no reason why we cannot dye good colors. At the same time, the patterns of weaving, and the conversion of native silk to factory silk, all need to be researched and improved in order to find a way out. The silk weaving industry in Wuxing silently abides by the rules, still regards itself as the "home of silk" in China, but does not study the reasons for its decline, which is really regrettable.

Furthermore, in a place like Wuxing, which produces silk, it should be particularly emphasized and more research institutions should be added. However, in addition to a province-run sericulture school, Wuxing cannot find a school that studies silk weaving. In the only silk industry elementary school in Wuxing, the courses taught are no different from those of ordinary elementary schools. The reporter believes that a silk weaving [school] should be established, with the nature of a secondary school, specializing in the improvement of silk weaving, and then seeking the reform of the entire Wuxing silk weaving industry.

### Golden Monkey to Fly to America

May be Publicly Exhibited When Passing Through Shanghai

[Dispatch from Chengdu, October 28th, from this newspaper] The National Museum of the United States previously requested from the Sichuan Provincial Government a gift of the "Golden Monkey," a world-renowned rare animal that is unique to Sichuan and is as famous as the panda, for display and exhibition.

Recently, the China National Aviation Corporation agreed to provide free transportation to the United States. It will fly to Shanghai within days and then transfer to the United States. It may be publicly exhibited when passing through Shanghai. The remittance of 400 US dollars from outside has been transferred to hunters as bonuses and other expenses.

### Double-Bodied Freak Arrives in Suzhou from Wuxi

They arrived in Suzhou from Wuxi the day before yesterday and are scheduled to exhibit at the Central Bookstore for a week before planning to go to Shanghai.

### The Bleak Autumn in Xi'an

— Zhang Xianzhou, Reporter for This Newspaper

[Dispatch from Xi'an, October 27th, from this newspaper] August in the Northwest is the end of summer and the beginning of autumn, with blue sky, white clouds, and the cold desert. Time gives people an invigorating season. After the announcement of the "August 19th" economic reform plan, the ancient city was indeed lively for a while. After the long summer of bitter rain, people were hoping for a pleasant autumn to take a deep breath of stuffiness, but time flies, and who would have thought that after two months, the past lively scene has turned into a bleak situation in front of us. The future is long, and if we don't find a way to solve it sooner, who would have thought that its consequences would be so bad?

The prices of goods in Xi'an are keeping pace with Shanghai. When Shanghai rises, prices here will naturally rise. When Shanghai cannot sell goods, Xi'an will of course not be able to sell goods. Keeping pace with Shanghai, that's all.

At the beginning of October, strange phenomena occurred in the market in Xi'an. The goods on the shelves of many large stores disappeared overnight. The city gate was ordered to strictly prohibit the outflow of materials, but there was nothing to be seen in the stores in the city.

The municipal government could no longer tolerate it. Especially after the buying spree occurred, accusations came from all sides. Mayor Wang and Yan Siling Cao Rihui of Xi'an, on the one hand, ordered the military police to urge the merchants to open their doors to the market, and on the other hand, ordered the shock troops to raid the hoarders everywhere. Wang and Cao also personally took the car to patrol the central urban area to strictly investigate the scalpers who were reselling goods, and staged funny scenes of "spanking" and "masquerade parade" on the street.

The shops opened, but they only sold for one day. Every family was extremely empty and had nothing to sell. Until today, department stores open every day, but there is still no business to be done.

On the eve of the great war in eastern Shaanxi, the Shaanxi Provincial Government sent three members, Chen Guting, Shi Zhi, and Zhang Danping, to inspect the blockade line bordering the bandit area. The results they obtained were fruitful and fair. At a press conference, Member Zhang frankly admitted the serious phenomenon of material leakage. He said that according to the results of his investigation, unscrupulous merchants colluded with the Communist bandits. At that time, every two taels of gold could be exchanged for twenty-four taels of opium when transported to the Communist area. The round trip would be four times the profit, so it was enthusiastically sought after by desperadoes. Speaking of the methods of smuggling across the border, there are roughly two types: one is to cross the blockade line from small roads, and the other is to collectively armed forced crossing, in coordination with the military operations of the bandit army. Most of those bandits rode horses and carried guns. When the bandit side broke through a certain stronghold of the National Army, the entire line was tense, and they rushed through the town.

A sad rain, several autumn gatherings, calculated by the multiple of the price of goods, this year's chrysanthemums in Xi'an are the cheapest. I heard that even so cheap, it is still difficult to sell.
